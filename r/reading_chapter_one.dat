40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses J. M. Barrie's novels Sentimental Tommy (1896) and Tommy and Grizel (1900) {{in terms}} of their narrative explorations of the moral implications of art. In particular, it finds the novels preoccupied with the power relations between reader and text, and with {{the question of whether the}} playful pleasures of art can ever justify the moral problems created when its power relations are reproduced in social relationships. 	The introduction identifies these concerns in the style of the novels through close <b>reading.</b> <b>Chapter</b> <b>one</b> establishes the thesis that, within these novels, art is defined as excess and inconsistency, producing some surprising correspondences to late Nineteenth-Century art theory. This ‘art’ is personified by the protagonist, Tommy, who is shown to have both learned and inherited his artistic disposition. Chapter two identifies a complementary personification, of social morality, in the character of Grizel, which enables their relationship symbolically to play out tensions between art and society. This chapter also finds that these tensions are conceived in the novels as a debate on the gendering of power within heterosexual erotic relationships, wherein the intruding power dynamics of art disturb normative gender roles. 	Chapter three, conversely, examines a selection of Tommy's non-romantic relationships and finds them to reveal a model of human selfhood as innately inconsistent, though necessarily modified by social relations. As such, Barrie also, and equally, portrays art as potentially therapeutic, since it allows the expression of individualistic concerns. Finally, the conclusion proposes that this ambivalence towards the morality of art culminates, both in these novels and in Barrie's later work, in a symbolic and paradigmatic mother/eternal boy relationship. Acknowledgement of the complexity of this symbolism, I propose, is of consequence, partly because it is precisely this aspect of Barrie's work that has survived and become significant within Western culture...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers poetic {{responses to}} the Shoah: the critical and cultural consequences of the genre in relation to this catastrophe have been largely neglected or discussed primarily in light of Theodor Adorno's narrow statement questioning the possibility of writing poetry after Auschwitz. I maintain, however, that {{it is vital to}} engage the transnational and multi-lingual breadth of poetry, which lays claim to the problems as well as the significance of its endurance, as it confronts attempts to regulate creative impulses {{on the one hand and}} to mandate forms of testimony and commemoration on the other hand. In what I term a "poetics of survival," the works I examine employ intertextuality to question the ethical implications of situating poetic voice and address. These works explore the limits of poetic form, in order to foreground poetry as a literary mode that is involved in critical discourse and ethical critique rather than invested only in aesthetic or historical representation. Thus, the poets insist upon their dialogues and disputes across genres ranging from correspondence to philosophy, as they confront cultural and textual traditions that seek to mourn and commemorate devastating loss. 	In the Introduction, I focus on theoretical and critical conceptions of survival, illustrating the ways in which a poetics of survival problematizes literary forms that attempt to make sense of individual and communal suffering, both through authoring and through <b>reading.</b> <b>Chapter</b> <b>One</b> investigates Rachel Blau DuPlessis' long poem "Draft 52 : Midrash," which argues with Adorno's famous declaration that "to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric. " Through elaborating and responding to her interpretation of Adorno's claim, DuPlessis' poem urges us to reconsider the categorical understanding of his pronouncement, which has shaped critical discourse. I take up DuPlessis' poetic challenge to Adorno's critical authority at the same time that I investigate the manifold ways in which he himself modulated this argument throughout his oeuvre. Chapter Two reflects on the intertextual resonances in both the poetry and the correspondence between Paul Celan and Nelly Sachs: I examine their figurations of breath, which I read as the critical boundary that simultaneously separates and binds together life and death, and as the mutual foundation and limit of poetry and existence after the Shoah. Chapter Three offers readings of the Yiddish poet Malka Heifetz Tussman, whose work confronts, refutes, and reimagines the viability of a poetics of survival in a language whose very existence has been called into question through the annihilation of so many of its speakers. 	Ultimately, I postulate that a poetics of survival both institutes and explores a crucial tension between experience and expression. This tension takes shape as a limit-space, where the urgency and difficulty of the poetic emerge with particular force, since poetry is the genre most intimately and consciously bound up with the consequence of voice and address in the context of an exploration of form. By looking at the complicated relationship between body and text - particularly through the ways in which the writers figure survival as a condition that entangles life and language - I illuminate the intertwined pressures of ethics and memory, while questioning implicit hierarchies that seek to regulate the connections between the literal and the figural, the critical and the poetic, the historical and the aesthetic...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This thesis aims {{to broaden}} the scope of inquiry into {{castaway}} fiction for or about children by mapping the changing epistemological approaches to subjectivity, within five castaway novels spanning {{the early nineteenth century}} to post-World War Two. The novels include The Swiss Family Robinson (Johann Wyss, 1816), The Coral Island (Robert Ballantyne, 1857), Kidnapped (Robert Louis Stevenson, 1886), A High Wind in Jamaica (Richard Hughes, 1929) and Lord of the Flies (William Golding, 1954). Taking close textual analysis as my default research method, this thesis is concerned with analysing how the child castaway materialised and evolved out a shift from religious hegemony and Humanist pedagogy operating in The Swiss Family Robinson to that of scientific rationalism and post-war postmodernism in Lord of the Flies. As a means of identifying and exploring the castaway child through these paradigm shifts, I have developed a psychoanalytic and poststructuralist theoretical framing for my analysis that draws on Jacques Lacan’s The Mirror Stage As Formative Of The Function Of The I As Revealed In Psychoanalytic Experience (1966), and Julia Kristeva’s Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection (1980). These theoretical approaches to the relationship between subjectivity and language enhance my readings of how these castaways advocate historically specific language structures through which subjectivity is produced and can be <b>read</b> dialogically. <b>Chapter</b> <b>one</b> will analyse how the castaway child materialises in The Swiss Family Robinson as a ‘knowable’ subject of Enlightenment pedagogy influenced by three key works: namely John Locke’s Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693), Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Emile (1762) and Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe (1919). Developed through this intellectual triad, I interpret Wyss’s novel as representing the beginnings of the epistemological child castaway, which evolves dialogically. The following chapters will investigate how this ‘knowable’ child is gradually destabilised through increasingly fragmented representations of the castaway child, developed through the epistemological contexts of scientific rationalism, Darwinism, psychoanalysis, and post-war postmodernism...|$|R

Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution.

40|$|Adults {{with mild}} to {{moderate}} acquired brain injury (ABI) often pursue post-secondary or professional education after their injuries in order to enter or re-enter the job market. An increasing number of these adults report problems with reading-to-learn. The problem is particularly concerning given the growing population of adult survivors of ABI. Combat-related brain trauma and sports concussions are two factors contributing to increases in traumatic brain injuries, while higher incidences of stroke in young adults and better rates of survival after brain tumors are contributing to increases in non-traumatic brain injuries. Despite the rising need, empirical evaluation of reading comprehension interventions for adults with ABI is scarce. This study used a within-subject design to evaluate whether adult college students with ABI {{with no more than}} moderate cognitive impairments benefited from using a multi-component reading comprehension strategy package to improve comprehension of expository text. The strategy package was based on empirical support from the cognitive rehabilitation literature that shows individuals with ABI benefit from metacognitive strategy training to improve function in other academic activities. Further empirical support was drawn from the special education literature that demonstrates other populations of struggling readers benefit from reading comprehension strategy use. In this study, participants <b>read</b> <b>chapters</b> from an introductory-level college Anthropology textbook in two different conditions: strategy and no-strategy. The results indicated that providing these readers with reading comprehension strategies was associated with better recall of correct information units in two free recall tasks: one elicited immediately after <b>reading</b> the <b>chapter,</b> and <b>one</b> elicited the following day. The strategy condition was also associated with better efficiency of recall in the delayed task and a more accurate ability to recognize statements from a sentence verification task designed to reflect the local and global coherence of the text. The findings support further research into using reading comprehension strategies as an intervention approach for the adult ABI population. Future research needs include identifying how to match particular reading comprehension strategies to individuals, examining whether reading comprehension performance improves further through the incorporation of systematic training, and evaluating texts from a range of disciplines and genres...|$|R
