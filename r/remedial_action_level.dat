The development of existing controls has relied heavily on overseas data and often lags behind the implementation of controls elsewhere. Indoor air standards {{have been developed for}} ventilation in public buildings commensurate with U. S. standards. A recommended goal for formaldehyde exposure levels has been set at 0. 1 ppm and a <b>remedial</b> <b>action</b> <b>level</b> for radon at 200 Bq/m 3.

500|$|General Commandant Superior Aubert, who {{had been}} so lenient towards Le Tacon, {{organised}} an internal army purge in parallel with the trials of the Criminal Commissions. Its objectives were to reassert control over the native armed forces in Tonkin by identifying, penalising, isolating, and re-educating disloyal troops, thereby setting an example to the others. According to Patrice Morlat, [...] "545 tirailleurs and warrant officers were the object of sanctions: 164 were transferred into disciplinary companies in Tonkin, 94 to Africa..., 57 were {{handed over to the}} civilian jurisdiction, and 160 were reduced to the ranks and put on leave without pay." [...] Such <b>remedial</b> <b>actions</b> demonstrated the <b>level</b> of infiltration of the army, and clearly showed that the predominant culpability for the mutiny was seen to be placed squarely on the Vietnamese. In contrast with the first phase of suppression of the VNQDD in 1929, when 121 soldiers suspected of having VNQDĐ membership were punished and 40 put under investigation by the Sûreté, the measures taken after Yen Bay were far more extensive and harsh. More than 500 out of Tonkin's 12,000 indigenous soldiers, a percentage of 4.5%, were punished by the military, demonstrating the extent to which Vietnamese soldiers in the north were seen to be involved in activities contrary to their military duty.|$|R
