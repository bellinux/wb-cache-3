5|$|Cocaine, {{substituted}} amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, methylphenidate (marketed as <b>Ritalin</b> or Concerta), MDMA (ecstasy) {{and other}} psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine {{levels in the}} brain {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. Cocaine and methylphenidate are dopamine transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors; they non-competitively inhibit dopamine reuptake, resulting in increased dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft. Like cocaine, substituted amphetamines and amphetamine also increase the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, but by different mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Bart wanders onto a U.S. Army {{base and}} manages to hijack a tank. He cuts {{a swath of}} {{destruction}} through the town and eventually stops at the school. There, he points the tank's cannon into the sky and shoots down a Major League Baseball satellite; inside are detailed documents on everybody's behaviors. Mark McGwire appears, distracts the citizens with a long home run, and hides the evidence under his cap. Marge takes Bart off Focusyn for good and puts him back on <b>Ritalin.</b> Major League Baseball, however, still spies on the Simpson family due to an autographed bat McGwire gave Bart that has a hidden camera.|$|E
5|$|Focusyn, {{the fictional}} psychoactive drug that is {{prominently}} featured throughout the episode, {{is based on}} the real-life medicine <b>Ritalin,</b> which is used to treat disorders such as ADHD. Hosey the Bear, which {{can be seen in the}} beginning of the episode, is a reference to the United States Forest Service's mascot Smokey Bear. After Bart has flooded the school gym, Skinner can be seen wiping mud off his eyes in an homage to American actor Oliver Hardy. The sequence of Bart stealing an army tank and destroying half of Springfield under the influence of mind-altering substances is likely a reference to Shawn Nelson, a man infamous for a similar, albeit serious, incident. A scene in the episode shows Marge standing in front of the tank Bart has stolen. The scene is a reference to Tank Man, the anonymous man who stood in the way of a column of tanks the morning after the Chinese military forcibly removed pro-democracy protesters from Beijing's Tiananmen Square.|$|E

40|$|Administration of {{methylphenidate}} (MPH, <b>Ritalins)</b> {{to children}} with {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) is an elective therapy, but raises concerns for public health, due to possible persistent neurobehavioral alterations. Wistar adolescent rats (30 to 46 day old) were administered MPH or saline (SAL) for 16 days, and tested for reward-related and motivational-choice behaviors. When tested in adulthood in a drug-free state, MPH-pretreated animals showed increased choice flexibility and economical efficiency, as well as a dissociation between dampened place conditioning and more marked locomotor sensitization induced by cocaine, compared to SALpretreated controls. The striatal complex, a core component of the natural reward system, was collected both {{at the end of the}} MPH treatment and in adulthood. Genome-wide expression profiling, followed by RT-PCR validation on independent samples, showed that three members of the postsynaptic-density family and five neurotransmitter receptors were upregulated in the adolescent striatum after subchronic MPH administration. Interestingly, only genes for the kainate 2 subunit of ionotropic glutamate receptor (Grik 2, also known as KA 2) and the 5 -hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 7 (Htr 7) (but not GABAA subunits and adrenergic receptor a 1 b) were still upregulated in adulthood. cAMP responsive element-binding protein and Homer 1 a transcripts were modulated only as a long-term effect. In summary, our data indicate short-term changes in neural plasticity, suggested by modulation of expression of key genes, and functional changes in striatal circuits. These modifications might in turn trigger enduring changes responsible for the adult neurobehavioral profile, that is, altered processing of incentive values and a modified flexibility/habit balance...|$|R

25|$|Methylphenidate, {{sold under}} various trade names, <b>Ritalin</b> {{being one of}} the most {{commonly}} known, is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the phenethylamine and piperidine classes that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy.

25|$|Psychological {{disorders}} {{like that}} of {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) can be treated with drugs like methylphenidate (also known as <b>Ritalin),</b> which block the re-uptake of dopamine by the pre-synaptic cell, thereby providing an increase of dopamine left in the synaptic gap. This increase in synaptic dopamine will increase binding to receptors of the post-synaptic cell. This same mechanism is also used by other illegal and more potent stimulant drugs such as cocaine.|$|E

25|$|The first {{reported}} evidence of stimulant medication {{used to treat}} children with concentration and hyperactivity problems came in 1937. Charles Bradley in Providence, Rhode Island reported {{that a group of}} children with behavioral problems improved after being treated with the stimulant Benzedrine. In 1954, the stimulant methylphenidate (<b>Ritalin,</b> which was first produced in 1944) became available; it {{remains one of the most}} widely prescribed medications for ADHD. Initially the drug was used to treat narcolepsy, chronic fatigue, depression, and to counter the sedating effects of other medications. The drug began to be used for ADHD in the 1960s and steadily rose in use.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{stimulant}} and non-stimulant medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. The most commonly used stimulant medications include methylphenidate (<b>Ritalin,</b> Concerta), mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse). Non-stimulant medications with a specific indication for ADHD include atomoxetine (Strattera), guanfacine (Intuniv), and clonidine (Kapvay). Other medicines which may be prescribed off-label include bupropion (Wellbutrin), tricyclic antidepressants, SNRIs, or MAOIs. The presence of comorbid (co-occurring) disorders can make finding the right treatment and diagnosis much more complicated, costly, and time-consuming. So it is recommended to assess and simultaneously treat any comorbid disorders.|$|E
25|$|The stimulants are {{the first}} line of {{treatment}} for ADHD, with proven efficacy, but they do fail in up to 20% of cases, even in patients without tic disorders. Current prescribed stimulant medications include: methylphenidate (brand names <b>Ritalin,</b> Metadate, Concerta), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall). Other medications can be used when stimulants are not an option. These include the alpha-2 agonists (clonidine and guanfacine), tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine and nortriptyline), and newer antidepressants (bupropion and venlafaxine). There have been case reports of tics worsening with bupropion (brand name Wellbutrin). There is good empirical evidence for short-term safety and efficacy for the use of desipramine, bupropion and atomoxetine (Strattera).|$|E
25|$|Methylphenidate is {{produced}} in the United States, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, Pakistan, and India.

Brand names for methylphenidate include <b>Ritalin,</b> Concerta, Aptensio, Biphentin, Daytrana, Equasym, Medikinet, Metadate, Methylin, and Quillivant. Generic forms are produced by numerous pharmaceutical companies throughout the world. In Belgium the product is sold under the name Rilatine and in Brazil, Portugal and Argentina as Ritalina. In Thailand, it is found under the name Hynidate. In India, it is found under the names Addwize and Inspiral SR.|$|E

25|$|The TCAs {{were used}} in the past in the {{clinical}} treatment of ADHD, though they are not typically used anymore, having been replaced by more effective agents with fewer side effects such as atomoxetine (Strattera, Tomoxetin, Attentin) and stimulants like methylphenidate (<b>Ritalin,</b> Focalin, Concerta), and amphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine, Vyvanse). ADHD is thought to be caused by an insufficiency of dopamine and norepinephrine activity in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Most of the TCAs inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine, though not dopamine, and as a result, they show some efficacy in remedying the disorder. Notably, the TCAs are more effective in treating the behavioral aspects of ADHD than the cognitive deficits, as they help limit hyperactivity and impulsivity, but have little to no benefits on attention.|$|E

500|$|Altered {{dopamine}} neurotransmission is {{implicated in}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD), a condition associated with impaired cognitive control, in turn leading to problems with regulating attention (attentional control), inhibiting behaviors (inhibitory control), and forgetting things or missing details (working memory), among other problems. [...] There are genetic links between dopamine receptors, the dopamine transporter, and ADHD, in addition to links to other neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. The most important relationship between dopamine and ADHD involves the drugs that are used to treat ADHD. Some of the most effective therapeutic agents for ADHD are psychostimulants such as methylphenidate (<b>Ritalin,</b> Concerta) and amphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine), drugs that increase both dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain. The clinical effects of these psychostimulants in treating ADHD are mediated through the indirect activation of dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, specifically dopamine receptor D1 and adrenoceptor A2, in the prefrontal cortex.|$|E

[...] The National Institute of Drug Abuse-funded study, published in 2006, has been praised by experts for the soundness of its experimental design. In the experiment, 36 volunteers without prior experience with hallucinogens were given psilocybin and methylphenidate (<b>Ritalin)</b> in separate sessions; the methylphenidate sessions served as a control and psychoactive placebo. The degree of mystical experience was measured using a questionnaire developed by Ralph W.

Two months after taking psilocybin, 79% of the participants reported moderately to greatly increased life satisfaction and sense of well-being. About 36% of participants also had a strong to extreme [...] "experience of fear" [...] or dysphoria (i.e., a [...] "bad trip") at some point during the psilocybin session (which was not reported by any subject during the methylphenidate session); about one-third of these (13% of the total) reported that this dysphoria dominated the entire session.
