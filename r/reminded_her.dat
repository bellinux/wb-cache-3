5|$|Hügel-Marshall {{continued}} {{to study and}} achieved a license in child education and welfare. She then found work in a children's home in Frankfurt am Main, where she worked for twelve years. The home <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> of the degrading orphanage she {{had been sent to}} and seemed more like a detention center than a school. Working with the other teachers, and over the opposition of the school's management, she was able to make substantial changes and to modernize it during her time there. While working there, she completed a degree in social work and pedagogy.|$|E
5|$|Sue's cheer squad loses at Regionals for {{the first}} time in seven years, and she is named Loser of the Year in a {{televised}} interview with Katie Couric. Furthering her ire, the cheerleading budget is slashed due to the cannon being seen as endangering the lives of children. The money is then handed over to the glee club so they can pay to go to regionals. Karofsky dismisses Finn's suggestion that he join the glee club permanently. Finally, Quinn kisses Finn, telling him that his actions have <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> of why she loved him.|$|E
5|$|Editor Vanessa Whitburn told Chris Arnot of The Independent {{that the}} climax to the storyline was planned three {{months prior to}} the show's anniversary. When Ruth listened to a {{voicemail}} from her daughter, it <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> of home and she called Sam to say she could not be with him. Ruth then turned to Usha for support, before returning home to David, who observed Ruth's emotional state. After Sam quit his job, Ruth eventually told David the truth about what happened. Bentinck explained that when he and Finch finished recording the scene, they were both crying as it had been very distressing. David was initially unable to forgive Ruth for her actions, but after speaking to Usha and gaining some perspective, over time things between himself and Ruth became easier.|$|E
5000|$|The tulips {{work against}} {{her desire to}} [...] "lie with her hands turned up and be utterly empty.” She personifies them with excitability, with loud breathing, and with eyes that watch her as she rests. Her choice of {{adjectives}} - [...] "excitable," [...] "red," [...] vivid" [...] - all imbue them {{with a sense of}} liveliness. In fact, they are dangerous and alluring like an African cat. Even their color <b>reminds</b> <b>her</b> of her wound, which implicitly suggests it <b>reminds</b> <b>her</b> of her past.|$|R

5|$|Homer, having {{forgotten}} Marge's birthday, rushes {{out to buy}} her {{a present}} at the Springfield Mall. He finds a bowling ball and decides to buy it for her. During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as the Mona Lisa from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Isola {{designed}} the popular pattern Primavera, consisting of stylized Marigold flowers; this {{has since been}} printed in many different colours for tablecloths, plates and other items. In 1976 she returned to Paris, working with Al-Haggagi {{on a series of}} Egypt-inspired prints including Niili (Nile), Nubia, and Papyrus. The next year she accompanied Al-Haggagi to Boone, North Carolina where he was a lecturer. She spent the year painting, walking, and doing yoga, inspired by the scenery of the Appalachian Mountains, which she said <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> of her home town, Riihimäki. She made some designs but found it hard to sell any in the American market, as there were few factories that could print fabrics to her specifications.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin IV died {{in early}} 1185. His successor, the child BaldwinV died {{in late summer}} 1186. The High Court of Jerusalem had ruled that neither BaldwinV's mother, Sybilla (who was Guy of Lusignan's wife), nor her sister, Isabella (who was the wife of Raynald's stepson), could be crowned without the {{decision}} of the pope, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the kings of France and England about BaldwinV's lawful successor. However, Sybilla's uncle, JoscelinIII of Courtenay, took control of Jerusalem with the support of Raynald and other influential prelates and royal officials. Raynald urged the townspeople to accept Sybilla as the lawful monarch, according to the Estoire de Eracles. The bailli, RaymondIII of Tripoli, and his supporters tried to prevent her coronation and <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> partisans of {{the decision of the}} High Court. Ignoring their protest, Raynald and Gerard of Ridefort, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, accompanied Sybilla to the Holy Sepulchre, where she was crowned. She also arranged the coronation of her husband, although he was unpopular even among her supporters. Her opponents tried to persuade Raynald's stepson, Humphrey, to claim the crown on his wife's behalf, but Humphrey deserted them and swore fealty to Sybilla and Guy. Raynald headed the list of secular witnesses in four royal charters issued between 21October 1186 and 7March 1187, showing that he had become a principal figure in the new king's court.|$|E

5|$|The Yakamas {{also have}} a legend {{attempting}} to explain Adams’ squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the Goat Rocks), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), Rainier, and St. Helens. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now {{the first to be}} greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the Columbia and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee (the Three Sisters) convinced Wyeast (Hood) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto would have none of it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken {{with the rest of the}} mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The Great Spirit had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.|$|E

Thumb wanted Barnum on his side in this love affair (rather than on Nutt's side), so he quietly promised Barnum he would marry Lavinia in a public ceremony. Barnum knew at once that such a spectacle would make him a fortune. He told Lavinia to take Thumb's romantic interest seriously. He <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> that the little man was rich.|$|E
25|$|Wald wrote short biographical {{stories in}} an attempt to {{overcome}} the traumatic experiences of the concentration camps, and until her death suffered both physically and mentally from the effects of her imprisonment. Along with the memories she could not forget, she could no longer bear to hear music, which <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> of the Auschwitz orchestra, which had played for incoming transports of prisoners. Succumbing often to depression, she attempted suicide numerous times, and ended up addicted to the drugs given to her for the depression. After being scheduled to testify in the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials, which she wanted to do, her memories became so overpowering to her, she suffered a complete mental breakdown and died in a psychiatric clinic in Ilten, near Hanover at the age of 48.|$|E
25|$|While Genie {{lived with}} the Riglers her mother usually met with her once {{a week at a}} park or restaurant, and their {{relationship}} continued to grow stronger. Although the Riglers never expressed antipathy towards Genie's mother their efforts to be polite to her inadvertently came off as condescension, and years later Marilyn said she was uncomfortable acting as a mother to Genie in her house with Genie's real mother present. With the exception of Jay Shurley, who felt the other scientists did not treat her as an equal, Genie's mother did not get along well with the other researchers, some of whom disliked her due to her apathy during Genie's childhood. The scientists speculated Genie's mother gave them a mostly cool reception because they <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> of her earlier inaction on behalf of her children, and David Rigler also thought she was in denial about Genie's condition and the hand she had in causing it. Curtiss wrote that Genie's mother often gave conflicting statements about her married life and Genie's childhood, seemingly saying what she thought people wanted to hear, which the research team believed was out of fear of reprobation or ostracism for telling the truth.|$|E
