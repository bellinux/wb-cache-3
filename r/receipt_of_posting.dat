40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the prevalence and predictors <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> practical support among {{acute coronary syndrome}} (ACS) survivors during the early post-discharge period. METHOD: 406 ACS patients were interviewed about <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> practical (instrumental and informational) support during the week after discharge. Demographic, clinical, functional, and psychosocial predictors of instrumental and informational practical support were examined. RESULTS: 81 % of participants reported receiving practical support during the early post-discharge period: 75 % reported <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> instrumental support and 51 % reported <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> informational support. Men {{were less likely to}} report receiving certain types of practical support, whereas married participants and those with higher education, impaired health literacy, impaired activities of daily living, and in-hospital complications {{were more likely to report}} receiving certain types of practical support.

40|$|A {{disproportionate number}} of cancer deaths occur among racial/ethnic minorities, {{particularly}} African Americans, who have a 33 % higher risk of dying of cancer than whites. Although differences in incidence and stage of disease at diagnosis may contribute to racial disparities in mortality, evidence of racial disparities in the <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> treatment of other chronic diseases {{raises questions about the}} possible role of inequities in the <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> cancer treatment. To evaluate racial/ethnic disparities in the <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> cancer treatment, we examined the published literature that addressed access/use of specific cancer treatment procedures, trends in patterns of use, or survival studies. We found evidence of racial disparities in <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> definitive primary therapy, conservative therapy, and adjuvant therapy. These treatment differences could not be completely explained by racial/ethnic variation in clinically relevant factors. In many studies, these treatment differences were associated with an adverse impact on the health outcomes of racial/ethnic minorities, including more frequent recurrence, shorter disease-free survival, and higher mortality. Reducing the influence of nonclinical factors on the <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> cancer treatment may, therefore, provide an important means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in health. New data resources and improved study methodology are needed to better identify and quantify the full spectrum of nonclinical factors that contribute to the higher cancer mortality among racial/ethnic minorities and to develop strategies to facilitate <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> appropriate cancer care for all patients...|$|R

Despite insurance coverage for IBRS, utilization of IBRS remains low. Data from publicly available sources for 2010 - 2012 are used to examine the association between hospital characteristics <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> IBRS by patients. Minority-serving status, low bed size, for-profit ownership, non-teaching status, high competition, low density of plastic surgeons in the market and non-metropolitan location are associated with lower likelihood <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> IBRS. Racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to receive IBRS. A mixed effects logistic regression model with interactions between Black/Hispanic race/ethnicity and hospital variables is estimated to examine whether certain hospital characteristics are associated with disparately low <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> IBRS for racial and ethnic minorities. Minority-serving hospitals located in markets with a higher density of plastic surgeons and higher competition characteristics are associated with disparately low <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> IBRS for racial and ethnic minorities.
