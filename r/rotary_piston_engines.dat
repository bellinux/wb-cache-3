50|$|The P.B.23 was {{designed}} in 1915 as a single-seat biplane scout, with a fuselage nacelle strut-mounted between the wings. The nacelle had an open cockpit {{for the pilot}} at the front and at the rear an 80 hp (60 kW) Le Rhône 9C engine driving a pusher propeller. Twin fins and rudders were mounted on a wide-span tailplane with an elevator attached, all connected to the wing structure with four tailbooms. The P.B.23 failed to gain an order after it first flew in September 1915, but twenty of an improved version, the P.B.25, were ordered by the Royal Naval Air Service. The P.B.25 had swept-back wings, a modified landing gear and a revised fuselage nacelle and although originally powered by a 110 hp (82 kW) Clerget rotary engine, the 20 RNAS aircraft were fitted with Gnome Monosoupape 9 Type B-2 <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|E

25|$|The PKZ-2 was {{developed}} by Žurovec in parallel with the PKZ-1, but wholly independently. Zurovec acknowledged the support only of Petróczy, although later reports have mistakenly attributed the entire design to Kármán. The aircraft was built by Dr Liptak & Co AG under Žurovek's direction. It had three radiating arms, each housing a <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engine.</b> These engines were coupled together to drive a central pair of co-axial, contra-rotating two-bladed wooden propellers or rotors, of 6m diameter, mounted above the airframe. A round cockpit for the aircrew was fixed centrally, {{on top of the}} rotor mast. Landing gear again comprised rubber-fabric cushions, one large central one and three smaller ones {{at the end of each}} arm.|$|R

In addition to aircraft, the collection includes many other historic artifacts relating to Sacramento's aerospace heritage. It also houses an extensive collection of historic aircraft engines.

25|$|Wankel <b>rotary</b> <b>engine</b> and <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> displacement, and {{corresponding}} power, output can more accurately be compared by displacement per {{revolution of the}} eccentric shaft. A calculation of this form dictates that a two-rotor Wankel displacing 654cc per face will have a displacement of 1.3 liters per every rotation of the eccentric shaft (only two total faces, one face per rotor going through a full power stroke) and 2.6 liters after two revolutions (four total faces, two faces per rotor going through a full power stroke). The results are directly comparable to a 2.6-liter <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> with an even number of cylinders in a conventional firing order, which will likewise displace 1.3 liters through its power stroke after one revolution of the crankshaft, and 2.6 liters through its power strokes after two revolutions of the crankshaft. A Wankel rotary engine is still a four-stroke engine, and pumping losses from non-power strokes still apply, but the absence of throttling valves and a 50% longer stroke duration result in a significantly lower pumping loss compared to a four-stroke reciprocating <b>piston</b> <b>engine.</b> Measuring a Wankel rotary engine in this way more accurately explains its specific output, because the volume of its air fuel mixture put through a complete power stroke per revolution is directly responsible for torque, and thus the power produced.|$|R

40|$|During {{production}} proteins {{are exposed}} to various stresses which can cause protein denaturation and inactivation. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of shear forces which can occur during filling operations of pharmaceutical solutions with dosing equipment. Such shear forces possibly have a negative influence on shear sensitive substances and may lower the quality and yield of the final drug product. In the scope of this work a peristaltic pump and different sizes of <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pumps (RPPs) were compared in respect to induced protein aggregation due to shear damage caused by dosing equipment. The influence of various parameters such as filling speed, dosing volume, friction surface and exposure to air-liquid interfaces and on the intensity of the shear stress was examined. A characteristic <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pump parameter δ was developed and introduced as an indicator describing the potential of a <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pump to cause protein damage. Furthermore, excipients were tested on their ability to protect the model protein against shear-induced damage. 2 model proteins in solution, lactase (β-galactosidase) and rituximab, a recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody, were used and tested for their suitability as model proteins. No activity loss was seen for the sheared lactase solution, therefore finally rituximab was chosen as a model protein. The level of protein aggregation in the unsheared and sheared solutions was determined by Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) and SEC-HPLC. TEM was used to visualise protein aggregation. It was found that protein aggregation was induced by <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pumps however not by the peristaltic pump. The degree of protein damage was marginally low for large <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pumps such as RPP 3 and 4 and showed a considerable increase with smaller sizes like RPP 1 and 2.
