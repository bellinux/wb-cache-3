This {{may be attributed}} to the <b>reversed</b> <b>electrode</b> layer formed (diluted) under strong (weak) stratification and the corresponding radon and CO 2 increase (decrease). Minor deviations from that reverse relationship are expected to occur mostly because of aerosol or space charge advection influencing PG. We note here that although stable nighttime conditions can generate a <b>reverse</b> <b>electrode</b> effect, thus obscuring the GEC signal, the 01 : 00 – 04 : 00 UTC period still appears to be the best period to observe the GEC signal at the site (Fig.  7).

In the experiment under an <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> control, a bifurcation of the <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> against the bias voltage, i. e. the negative resistance, was observed. In this paper a comparison of a plasma behavior in a LH transition with that in an HL transition is made in order to investigate the bifurcation phenomena. The <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> IE is continuously changed using a current-control power supply, and the driving force, the J´B, is actively changed. The plasma parameters, ne, Te and the fluctuation level show sudden change in the negative resistance region, in both LH transition and HL transition. The driving force in the region where the poloidal rotation speed shows a rapid change is greater in LH transition than that in HL transition in the whole region.

After the H-L transition the local maxima shifted outward to the plasma periphery of ρ ~ 0. 8. The low order magnetic islands were formed resonating the magnetic Fourier components of (n, m) = (5, 3) by external perturbation coils.

30|$|When {{describing}} the electrode effect, Law (1963) explained {{that under the}} influence of FW–PG, positive ions are driven toward the ground and negative ions are repelled from the ground, which creates a deficit of negative ions and the formation of a positively charged layer close to the ground (electrode layer). Under non-turbulent conditions, such as those typically prevailing during nighttime, the electrode layer is suppressed to depths at an order of magnitude of a few decimeters (Crozier 1963).

40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{determine}} whether the concentration of nitric oxide (NO) at the arterial wall is increased subsequent to the abrupt elevation of blood flow in resistance arteries. Methods: Eight dogs underwent laparotomy with anesthesia, and their small bowels were exteriorized. NO concentration was measured with NO-specific electrodes (200 -μ–tip diameter) at the outer wall of the mesenteric arteries. Flow was increased by occlusion of the adjacent mesenteric arteries. In four animals, flow and NO concentration were measured after the administration of Nω-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (l-NAME) to inhibit NO production. Results: As arterial flow was increased from a baseline of 5. 4 ± 1. 3 ml/min to 10. 9 ± 1. 8 ml/min (p = 0. 001), NO <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> was elevated in every animal. With repetition of the flow stimulus, the response tended to be attenuated. In the first experimental trial, NO <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> measured at the arterial wall increased from 2. 86 ± 0. 56 to 3. 00 ± 0. 60 nA (p = 0. 02). l-NAME (10 mg/kg intravenous) effectively inhibited NO synthase {{as indicated by the}} elevation of mean arterial pressure (11 ± 1. 7 mm Hg; p = 0. 04). After administration of l-NAME, NO <b>electrode</b> <b>current</b> measured at the outer arterial wall fell 0. 23 ± 0. 05 nA (p = 0. 02). Conclusions: The data indicate that a doubling of blood flow in the canine mesenteric resistance arteries is associated with an increase in NO concentration of at least 100 nm at the outer arterial wall. This association is probably a substantial underestimation of the actual concentration because of the geometry of the electrode tip. To our knowledge, ours is the first report of direct in vivo measurement of flow-dependent NO release in resistance arteries. (J Vasc Surg 1998; 27 : 726 - 32. ...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{dielectric}} barrier discharges (DBDs) {{are used}} to delay flow separation behind a bluff body in atmospheric pressure air. The bluff body is made by connecting a flat plate to a half cylinder tangentially as a round-cornered trailing edge. Four DBD plasma actuators are attached along {{the surface of the}} half cylinder. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is utilized for studying the velocity field of the flow. In {{the first part of the}} study, flow alteration effects of two different discharge sources – a conventional alternating current (AC) discharge and an ultra short repetitively pulsed plasma discharge (USRD) - are compared for identical surface DBD configurations. It is found that, at an identical discharge power (~ 25 W), the AC discharge shows higher ability for flow alteration than the USRD. In the second part, the flow alteration effect of the AC DBD is investigated for varying free stream flow speeds, surface roughness, Reynolds number (Rex), and electrode configuration. The flow speed ranges from 10 m/s to 25 m/s and the corresponding Rex are from 5 × 104 – 5 × 105. In this flow regime, the separation point behind the bluff body can be moved downstream in the presence of the AC DBD. However, it is found that, as the flow speed increases, the separation delay effect decreases. The flow alteration effect also decreases with rougher surfaces and higher Rex. Finally, skewed <b>electrodes</b> and <b>reversed</b> <b>electrodes</b> relative to the flow direction are utilized as two different electrode configurations.
