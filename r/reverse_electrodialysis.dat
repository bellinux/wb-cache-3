40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis investigates the technical problems associated with large-scale stand-alone wind powered desalination employing a short-term energy store, particularly the complexities associated with the intermittent operation of the desalination plant. To achieve this, a non-linear, time domain system model of an existing wind powered desalination plant has been developed using the propriety code Simulink. Two desalination techniques have been considered: <b>reverse</b> osmosis and <b>electrodialysis,</b> due firstly to their relatively low specific energy consumption, and secondly, their efficient coupling to a wind turbine generator. As a way of reducing power mismatch, optimising water production, and above all reducing the switching rates of the desalination units, operation of the <b>reverse</b> osmosis and <b>electrodialysis</b> units under variable power conditions is suggested. Little information is available on plant performance under such conditions. A mathematical model has therefore been developed to ascertain the performance of <b>reverse</b> osmosis and <b>electrodialysis</b> processes under transient power conditions. The model consists of the set of partial differential equations (PDEs) describing the conservation of mass, momentum and chemical species coupled with the appropriate boundary conditions. A numerical solution based on the finite volume method has been employed to solve for the system of PDEs, as no analytical solution is available for the particular set of model equations derived. Sensitivity of plant performance to key design parameters (such as operating pressure and energy storage capacity) and operational strategies is predicted from simulation results. This technology is economically attractive for islands where wind energy density is high and water resources are scarce...|$|R

In this study, we show that the ion transport corresponding to the obtained energy and the electromotive force mutually influence each other, which enables capture of more than 50 % (even up to 95 %) of the theoretical energy, even when the feedwater streams pass a <b>reverse</b> <b>electrodialysis</b> cell only once...|$|E
40|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>electrodialysis</b> {{electrical}} power generation {{is based on}} the transport of salt ions through ion conductive membranes. The ion flux, equivalent to an electric current, results from a salinity gradient, induced by two salt solutions at significantly different concentrations. Such equivalent electric current in combination with the corresponding electrochemical potential difference across the membrane, equivalent to an electric potential, results in a battery equivalency. While having a co-current fluid flow of both solutions in the <b>reverse</b> <b>electrodialysis</b> cell pair compartments, a mathematical model needs to be based on both diffusion and convective mass transport equations in the compartments and on the, electromigration-based, ion transport through the membranes. The steady state salt ion flux through the membranes and the corresponding ion concentration distribution within the salt solution compartments of a <b>reverse</b> <b>electrodialysis</b> cell pair (in the absence of electrodes) was theoretically analysed by using two-dimensional finite element (FEM) modelling. Fundamental information on the effect of membrane thickness and fluid flow velocity was obtained. FEM simulations support the theoretical insight into <b>reverse</b> <b>electrodialysis</b> phenomena and thus assist in the planning/design of experimental work. The FEM approximation is superior with respect to a modelling of the combined effect of all complex and simultaneous ion transport mechanisms in the <b>reverse</b> <b>electrodialysis</b> cell pair compartments and ion conductive membranes.

40|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>electrodialysis</b> is a membrane-based {{technique}} for production of sustainable electricity from controlled mixing of a diluted electrolyte solution (e. g., river water) and a concentrated electrolyte solution (e. g., sea water). <b>Reverse</b> <b>electrodialysis</b> {{has been investigated}} with pure sodium chloride solutions. In practice, however, in most cases also other ions are present in both feed solutions. In the present paper, the effect of multivalent ions {{on the performance of}} a <b>reverse</b> <b>electrodialysis</b> stack was investigated. Results show that, besides a higher stack resistance in presence of multivalent ions, especially the presence of multivalent ions in the dilute solution has a lowering effect on the stack voltage. This can be explained by an observed transport of these ions from the diluted electrolyte solution to the concentrated electrolyte solution. In order to prevent or hamper this transport against the activity gradient, monovalent-selective membranes can be used. This shows indeed better results with respect to the stack voltage. Therefore, it would be beneficial to use monovalent-selective membranes in <b>reverse</b> <b>electrodialysis,</b> {{especially in the case of}} a relatively high content of multivalent ions in the dilute (i. e., in the first stages of the installation where the sodium chloride content in the dilute is still relatively low...|$|E

40|$|Both in {{electrodialysis}} and in <b>reverse</b> <b>electrodialysis</b> ionic shortcut currents {{through feed}} and drain channels cause a considerable loss in efficiency.

The critical parameters which are to be optimized are ¿/r and R/r, where ¿ is the lateral resistance along the spacers, R is the resistance of the feed and drain channels between two adjacent cells, and r is the internal resistance of a cell. Because these two parameters are dimensionless, different stacks can be easily compared. The model is validated with two experimental stacks differing in membrane type and spacer thickness, one with large ionic shortcut currents and one where this effect is less.

These conclusions are valid for present and latent performances of both techniques. According to the model, the potential performances of both techniques are much better than the current performances. In order to achieve these potential performances, the development of pressure-retarded osmosis must focus on membrane characteristics, i. e. increasing the water permeability of the membrane skin and optimization of the porous support.

This decreases the required membrane area. The concentration of the dilute compartment increases significantly during ARED operation due to the increased speed of desalination. This results in an overall decrease in total cell resistance. Although the energy demand for ARED is higher than for RED, the ARED-RO process still achieves a decrease in overall energy requirements at higher RO recoveries when compared to stand-alone RO.

40|$|The {{primary concern}} over nitrate in ground {{water is the}} {{occurrence}} of a disease called methemoglobinemia in human infants who drink water containing the nitrate ion. Nitrate contaminated water leads to lack of oxygen in the blood, causing oxygen starvation of the brain and, in some severe cases, death. Infant farm animals, particularly piglets, are similarly affected by nitrate. Two areas exist in Nebraska where nitrate contamination of ground water is becoming a serious problem. These problem areas are in Holt County and the Central Platte region. Most nitrate contamination is related to excessive application of commercial fertilizer on irrigated cropland with sandy topsoil and a shallow ground water table.

Battery manufacturing, metal plating, fertilizer industry, pigment dye stuff, mining operations and textile release heavy metals to environment via their waste effluents (Volesky 1990; Unlu and Ersoz 2006). Cadmium {{is one of the most}} toxic, non-biodegradable heavy metals and accumulated by absorption into living organisms (Victor et al. 2007). Cadmium toxicity effects include renal dysfunction, hypertension, hepatic injury, lung damage, anemia and teratogenic effects (Yu et al. 1999; Lodeiro et al. 2006; Kaewsarn and Yu 2001; Cheung et al. 2001). Cadmium pollution is due to metal plating, metallurgic alloying, ceramics, textile printing industry, photograph development, electroplating, alkaline battery manufacturing industries (Kadirvelu et al. 2001; Zhu et al. 2007). Therefore, cadmium level in wastewater, drinking water and water used for agriculture should be limited to the maximum permissible concentration (0.01  mg/L) (WPCRT 2004). The usual methods for the removal of heavy metal ions including cadmium from aqueous solutions can be stated as chemical precipitation, ion exchange, solvent extraction, phytoextraction, ultrafiltration, <b>reverse</b> osmosis, <b>electrodialysis</b> and adsorption (Patterson 1985; Bhattacharya and Mandal 2006).
