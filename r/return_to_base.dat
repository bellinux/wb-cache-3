5|$|On its <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base,</b> the {{expedition}} {{learned of the}} presence of Amundsen, camped with his crew and a large contingent of dogs in the Bay of Whales, 200miles (320km) to their east. Scott conceded that his ponies {{would not be able to}} start early enough in the season to compete with Amundsen's cold-tolerant dog teams for the pole, and also acknowledged that the Norwegian's base was closer to the pole by 60 miles.|$|E
5|$|Ivry {{received}} {{the green light}} at 10:00 AM to execute the operation, but by then he had postponed the attack until 2:00 PM. At 1:30 PM, Eitan ordered Ivry to strike, and the Israeli aircraft took off in pairs. The first wave {{was made up of}} 96 F-15s and F-16s. The second wave which attacked the SAM batteries at 3:50 PM was made up of 92 aircraft. When the attack was launched, the Syrians ordered their combat air patrols to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> and land.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 is {{exceptionally}} tough, {{being able}} to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a back up if hydraulics are lost. Flight without hydraulic power uses the manual reversion control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, roll control is pilot-selected. In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base,</b> though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to fly with one engine, one half of tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing.|$|E
5000|$|Before <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> U-46 sank {{one more}} ship and {{attacked}} , {{though this was}} unsuccessful. U-48 sank four more ships, {{for a total of}} seven (...) , U-101 sank three more, including the passenger ship Wellington Star, for a total of seven (42,026 GRT).

5|$|The RN's Operational Intelligence Centre {{selected}} the route and timing for the raid based on intelligence about {{the location of}} minefields and German recognition signals sourced from Enigma decryptions and knowledge of Luftwaffe patrols compiled by the Air Ministry's Air Intelligence Branch. When all the plans had been pulled together and the timing worked out, the raid was expected to last no longer than two hours. The commandos and crew from Campbeltown would board the motor launches at the Old Mole jetty and then <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E
5|$|The torpedo bombers {{attacked}} Giffen's {{ships in}} two waves between 19:00 and 20:00. Two torpedoes hit the heavy cruiser , causing heavy damage and bringing {{her to a}} dead stop. Three of the Japanese aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships. In response, Halsey sent a tug to take Chicago under tow and ordered Giffen's task force to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> the next day. Six destroyers were left behind to escort Chicago and the tugboat.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{constant}} bombing sorties, Potez 25 and Breguet 19 aircraft {{were also}} used for daily supply missions to the besieged army garrison at Rogatica. They would land under fire at a small improvised grass landing strip, unloading ammunition and other supplies while keeping their engines running and taking off as soon as was possible. On 23 March, a ZNDH Potez 25 was shot down by the Partisans and the crew were killed. Three days later an Avia Fokker F.9 was damaged whilst dropping ammunition to Rogatica but managed to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> safely. As {{a result of the}} determined re-supply effort by the ZNDH, the Rogatica garrison succeeded in holding out until relieved by German-NDH forces on 17 April.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} {{afternoon}} of 3 April, Moore considered conducting a further raid on Kaafjord the next day. He decided against doing so as the preliminary assessment of photos taken during the attack had concluded that Tirpitz was badly damaged. Moore was also aware that his aircrew were fatigued, and was reluctant to expose them to what would now be alert defences. Accordingly, he ordered that the fleet <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base,</b> and it arrived at Scapa Flow in the afternoon of 6 April. King George VI and Prime Minister Winston Churchill sent congratulatory messages to the fleet, but both Churchill and Cunningham were concerned that Tirpitz could be returned to service. Cunningham also regretted Moore's decision not to launch a further strike on 4 April.|$|E
5|$|However, with Moltke crippled, Admiral Scheer {{decided to}} <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base.</b> Though {{scouting}} {{units of the}} Grand Fleet made brief contact with the Germans {{on the morning of}} 25 April, no action followed, and the High Seas Fleet made it home without incident. At one point in the chase, however, a reversal of course by the Germans meant that the entire Grand Fleet was forced to reorient itself in the opposite direction, placing Battleship Division Nine in the van. The result was that, if an encounter between the two fleets had occurred, American battleships would have led the British fleet into what could have been the largest naval battle of the war.|$|E
5|$|Later that {{afternoon}} Allen {{decided to break}} contact and <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base,</b> to avoid fighting a battle that could last until the evening. In the meantime, however, he called in air-strikes to inflict further damage on the base camp of his primary target, the 271st Regiment. That evening Brigadier General William Coleman and other senior officers of the 1st Infantry Division visited the 2nd Battalion's camp, where they praised Allen's men for their efforts, and presented First Lieutenant Clark Welch—commander of Delta Company—with a Silver Star for his actions earlier in the day. Allen then decided to launch a full-frontal attack against the 271st Regiment's base camp, {{to determine if the}} enemy unit was still there. However, {{due to the lack of}} sufficient manpower, Welch suggested that Allen should either call off the assault or get more soldiers on the ground for the operation. Allen dismissed Welch's suggestions, and responded by giving Captain James George—commander of Alpha Company—the responsibility of leading the attack instead of Welch.|$|E

5|$|Nine days later, Hurricanes, {{escorted by}} a pair of Spitfires from No. 352 Squadron, flew a patrol over the island of Rab and {{adjacent}} areas of the Adriatic, but were unable to positively identify any targets. On 4 November, aircraft from No. 351 Squadron, again escorted by two Spitfires, were tasked with interdicting road communications between Bihać and Knin. One aircraft developed engine trouble and had to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base,</b> but the rest continued with the mission. They ran into heavy anti-aircraft fire near Knin, and one aircraft was shot down, the pilot bailing out and being captured by the Germans. The next mission, on 9 November, was hampered by extremely poor weather over the target area near Trebinje. One aircraft flew into a mountain, killing the pilot, and another suffered engine trouble and crash-landed near Trebinje, the pilot escaping unhurt.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September 1911, Scott {{revealed}} {{his plans for}} the South Pole march. Sixteen men would set out, using the two remaining motor sledges, ponies and dogs for the Barrier stage of the journey, which would bring them to the Beardmore Glacier. At this point the dogs would <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> and the ponies would be shot for food. Thereafter, twelve men in three groups would ascend the glacier and begin the crossing of the polar plateau, using man-hauling. Only one of these groups would carry on to the pole; the supporting groups would be sent back at specified latitudes. The composition of the final polar group would be decided by Scott during the journey. For the return journey, Scott ordered that the dogs teams set off again from the base camp to replenish depots and meet the Polar party between latitude 82 and 82.30 on 1 March to assist the party home.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October MacLachlan was {{promoted}} to flying officer, and undertook an attack mission. During {{the course of the}} flight his wingtip made contact with the ground but he was able to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base.</b> The squadron settled down into winter quarters until March when they were reassigned to the French border region with Spain. On 1 April he celebrated his 21st birthday and took the opportunity of driving from Perpignan across the frontier into the Pyrenees to celebrate it. On 9 April the squadron was put on alert when the Germans invaded Denmark and Norway and the squadron were soon relocated to northern France at Mourmelon. On 10 May the Phoney War came to a close with the German invasion of Western Europe.|$|E

5|$|On 28 February, British {{pilots in}} Greece celebrated their biggest success in combat. No. 80 Squadron claimed 27 Italian {{aircraft}} without loss in 90 minutes of air combat. Pattle himself claimed three Fiat CR.42s {{shot down in}} less than three minutes. The Regia Aeronautica claimed that day it lost just one CR.42 (as confirmed by Italian pilot Corrado Ricci, a participant in those battles), plus four Fiat BR.20s and two G.50bis. The Italians claimed six Gladiators and one Supermarine Spitfire — none would be in the Mediterranean Theatre until March 1942 — while in fact only one Gladiator of No. 112 Squadron was lost, while two Blenheims, attacked by CR.42s had to crash-land returning to base. In a previous fight south of Vlorë, Pattle had to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> with the windscreen covered by oil from a shot down enemy bomber. His tally was now 21 air victories.|$|E
5|$|On February 10, 1952, Davis flew his 59th {{and last}} combat {{mission of the}} war in an F-86E Sabre (tail number 51-2752). That day, he led a flight of four F-86s on a patrol near the Yalu River, near the Manchurian border. Davis' group {{was part of a larger}} UN force of 18 F-86s {{operating}} in the area. As Davis' patrol reached the border, one of his F-86 pilots reported he was out of oxygen causing Davis to order him to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> with his wingman. As Davis continued patrolling with one wingman, Second Lieutenant William W. Littlefield, and cruising at an altitude of , they spotted a flight of 12 MiG-15s of the Chinese 4th Fighter Division heading in the direction of a group of US F-84 Thunderjets conducting a low-level bombing mission on North Korean communication lines.|$|E
5|$|The British patrol {{aircraft}} prevented Group Trutz {{from attacking}} the Home Fleet. At 21:48 on 17 July, a Consolidated B-24 Liberator assigned to No. 86 Squadron detected and sank U-361; {{none of the}} submarine's crew were rescued. Eight minutes later a No. 210 Squadron Consolidated PBY Catalina piloted by Flying Officer John Cruickshank spotted U-347 on the surface. The submarine's anti-aircraft guns damaged the Catalina, killing the navigator and wounding Cruickshank as well as three other crewmen, but the pilot continued his attack and sank U-347 with depth charges. The Catalina managed to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base,</b> and Cruickshank was awarded the Victoria Cross for this action. That night the Home Fleet sailed through {{the gap in the}} German patrol line that had been opened by the sinking of the two submarines.|$|E

5|$|The {{assault and}} {{security}} elements moved on foot towards the first crash area, passing through heavy fire, and occupied buildings south and {{southwest of the}} downed helicopter. They fought to establish defensive positions {{so as not to}} be pinned down by very heavy enemy fire, while treating their wounded, and worked to free the pilot's body from the downed helicopter. With the detainees loaded on trucks, the ground convoy force attempted to reach the first crash site. Unable to find it amongst the narrow, winding alleyways, the convoy came under devastating small arms and RPG fire. The convoy had to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> after suffering numerous casualties, and sustaining substantial damage to their vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The main march southward {{from the}} Bluff depot began on 1 January 1916. Within a few days, one team of three {{was forced to}} <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base,</b> {{following}} the failure of their Primus stove. The other six carried on: Mackintosh, Joyce, Ernest Wild, Dick Richards, Arnold Spencer-Smith and Victor Hayward. The 80° depot laid the previous season was reinforced, and new depots were built at 81° and 82°. As the party moved on towards the vicinity of Mount Hope, both Mackintosh and Spencer-Smith, the expedition's photographer, were hobbling. Shortly after the 83° mark was passed, Spencer-Smith collapsed and was left in a tent while the others struggled on the remaining few miles. Mackintosh rejected the suggestion that he should remain with the invalid, insisting {{that it was his}} duty to ensure that every depot was laid. On 26 January, Mount Hope was attained and the final depot put in place.|$|E
5|$|Westmoreland {{was unwilling}} to leave the Viet Cong with a {{position}} from which they could dominate Phước Long Province. So, on June 13, he {{made the decision to}} insert U.S. combat forces. Subsequently, 738 men of the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade, were flown out to the staging area in Phước Vinh. Elements of the 3rd Battalion (Airborne), 319th Artillery also followed later in the day. Upon arrival at Phước Vinh, the U.S. Army task force waited for five days, but it soon became apparent that the Viet Cong had withdrawn from the area and had no intention of holding territory. On June 18, the 1/503rd Infantry was ordered to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E
