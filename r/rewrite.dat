40|$|Automated {{deduction}} motivates {{the introduction}} of several extensions of <b>rewriting,</b> especially ordered <b>rewriting,</b> class <b>rewriting</b> and <b>rewriting</b> with constraints. This paper is a survey of these three notions, shows the evolution between them and their increasing power of expressivity. 1 Introduction Term <b>rewriting</b> techniques have {{a wide range of}} applications in mainly two domains: the first one is the operational semantics of logico-functional programming languages. This area led to various extensions of the <b>rewriting</b> concept, like order-sorted <b>rewriting</b> [29], conditional <b>rewriting</b> [16], priority <b>rewriting</b> [38], concurrent <b>rewriting</b> [18], or graph <b>rewriting</b> [11] : : :. The second domain is automated theorem proving where <b>rewriting</b> techniques are of primarily use in provers using demodulation or simplification inference rules to prune the search space. In this context, it appears that most of interesting proofs in mathematical structures, set and graph theory, or geometry, involv [...] ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{property}} of term <b>rewriting</b> systems is called modular {{if it is}} preserved under disjoint union. For unconditional term <b>rewriting</b> systems several modularity results are known. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze and extend these results to conditional term <b>rewriting</b> systems. It turns out that conditional term <b>rewriting</b> is much more complicated than unconditional <b>rewriting</b> from a modularity point of view. For instance, we show that the modularity of weak normalization for unconditional term <b>rewriting</b> systems does not extend to conditional term <b>rewriting</b> systems. On the positive side, we mention the extension of Toyama′s confluence result for disjoint unions of term <b>rewriting</b> systems to conditional term <b>rewriting...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{includes}} two main ideas. The first one, <b>rewriting</b> in an algebra, {{was introduced in}} [5]. The second one, boolean <b>rewriting,</b> {{can be found in}} many papers but we were never able to find a clear comparison with the classic one. We prefer <b>rewriting</b> in an algebra to term <b>rewriting.</b> This is our way to give a unique theory of <b>rewriting.</b> If the algebra is free, then we get the term <b>rewriting.</b> If the algebra is a certaine quotient of a free algebra then we get <b>rewriting</b> modulo equations. <b>Rewriting</b> is said to be boolean when the condition of each conditional equation is of boolean sort(in the free algebra it is a boolean term). We prove the classic <b>rewriting</b> is equivalent to boolean <b>rewriting</b> in a specific algebra, therefore, boolean <b>rewriting</b> is more general than the classic one...|$|R
5|$|The {{scenario}} {{consists of}} spin-off stories which expand on Rewrites story, the harvest festival from Rewrites story is expanded on in Harvest festa!, and minigames are included {{during the course}} of gameplay, as in <b>Rewrite.</b> The size of the scenario in Harvest festa! is roughly comparable in size to Tomoyo After. The fan disc also features official character art of Inoue, a supporting character who was not illustrated in <b>Rewrite.</b> Unlike <b>Rewrite,</b> Kotarou is fully voiced in the fan disc. The five system sound themes included with the <b>Rewrite</b> laptops were released with the fan disc, with the addition of dialogue of Kagari by Kana Hanazawa.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Rewrite</b> Harvest festa!, {{there are}} six {{separate}} scenarios, one for each heroine. The player is initially given the choice to play the scenarios for Kotori, Chihaya and Lucia from a character selection screen. Once these three scenarios are completed, the routes for Sizuru and Akane become available, and after those two are completed, Kagari's scenario is made available. After the completion of Kagari's scenario, a dungeon exploration role-playing minigame called <b>Rewrite</b> Quest becomes available.|$|E
