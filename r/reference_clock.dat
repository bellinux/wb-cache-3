25|$|To {{keep the}} wall clock {{in sync with}} the <b>reference</b> <b>clock,</b> each week the owner compares the time on his wall clock to a more {{accurate}} clock (a phase comparison), and he resets his clock. Left alone, the wall clock will continue to diverge from the <b>reference</b> <b>clock</b> at the same few seconds per hour rate.|$|E
25|$|PLLs are ubiquitous—they tune clocks {{in systems}} several feet across, {{as well as}} clocks in small {{portions}} of individual chips. Sometimes the <b>reference</b> <b>clock</b> may not actually be a pure clock at all, but rather a data stream with enough transitions that the PLL is able to recover a regular clock from that stream. Sometimes the <b>reference</b> <b>clock</b> is the same frequency as the clock driven through the clock distribution, other times the distributed clock may be some rational multiple of the reference.|$|E
25|$|Left on its own, each clock {{will mark}} time at {{slightly}} different rates. A wall clock, for example, might be fast {{by a few}} seconds per hour compared to the <b>reference</b> <b>clock</b> at NIST. Over time, that time difference would become substantial.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{constant}} bit-rate timing transfer, the <b>reference</b> <b>clocks</b> which encode and {{reconstruct the}} service clock at {{origin and destination}} may be jittered. We present new, straightforward approaches to finding and visualizing jitter spectra in timing transfer for jittered destination and <b>reference</b> <b>clocks,</b> and confirm our results by simulation.

25|$|These are high-precision {{timekeeping}} {{devices such}} as atomic (cesium, rubidium) clocks, GPS clocks or other radio clocks. They generate a very accurate pulse per second signal that triggers an interrupt and timestamp on a connected computer. Stratum 0 devices are also known as <b>reference</b> <b>clocks.</b>|$|R
25|$|On {{the day of}} a leap second event, ntpd {{receives}} notification {{from either}} a configuration file, an attached <b>reference</b> <b>clock,</b> or a remote server. Because of the requirement that time must appear to be monotonically increasing, a leap second is inserted with the sequence 23:59:59, 23:59:60, 00:00:00. Although the clock is actually halted during the event, any processes that query the system time cause it to increase by a tiny amount, preserving the order of events. If a negative leap second should ever become necessary, it would be deleted with the sequence 23:59:58, 00:00:00, skipping 23:59:59.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, the <b>reference</b> <b>clock</b> {{enters the}} chip and drives a {{phase locked loop}} (PLL), which then drives the system's clock {{distribution}}. The clock distribution is usually balanced so that the clock arrives at every endpoint simultaneously. One of those endpoints is the PLL's feedback input. [...] The function of the PLL is to compare the distributed clock to the incoming <b>reference</b> <b>clock,</b> and vary the phase and frequency of its output until the reference and feedback clocks are phase and frequency matched.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, [...] defined NTPv3. The RFC {{included}} {{an analysis of}} all sources of error, from the <b>reference</b> <b>clock</b> down to the final client, which enabled the calculation of a metric that helps choose the best server where several candidates appear to disagree. Broadcast mode was introduced.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presentation}} timestamp (PTS) is a timestamp metadata {{field in}} an MPEG transport stream or MPEG program stream {{that is used}} to achieve synchronization of programs' separate elementary streams (for example Video, Audio, Subtitles) when presented to the viewer. The PTS is given in units related to a program's overall <b>clock</b> <b>reference,</b> either Program <b>Clock</b> <b>Reference</b> (PCR) or System <b>Clock</b> <b>Reference</b> (SCR), which is also transmitted in the transport stream or program stream.|$|R

As each of them has 80 VLIW-5 units, this gave it 400 stream processors. <b>Reference</b> <b>clocks</b> were 775 MHz for all 5600s, while memory clocks varied between OEMs, as did the use of DDR3 and GDDR5 memory, the latter being twice as fast.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{electronic}} systems include processors of various sorts that operate at hundreds of megahertz. [...] Typically, the clocks supplied to these processors come from clock generator PLLs, which multiply a lower-frequency <b>reference</b> <b>clock</b> (usually 50 or 100nbsp&MHz) {{up to the}} operating frequency of the processor. [...] The multiplication factor can be quite large {{in cases where the}} operating frequency is multiple gigahertz and the reference crystal is just tens or hundreds of megahertz.|$|E
2500|$|Some PLLs {{also include}} a divider between the <b>{{reference}}</b> <b>clock</b> and the reference input to the phase detector. [...] If the divider in the feedback path divides by [...] and the reference input divider divides by , it allows the PLL to multiply the reference frequency by [...] [...] It might seem simpler to just feed the PLL a lower frequency, {{but in some cases}} the reference frequency may be constrained by other issues, and then the reference divider is useful.|$|E
2500|$|NTP uses a hierarchical, semi-layered {{system of}} time sources. Each level of this {{hierarchy}} is termed a [...] "stratum" [...] and is assigned a number starting with zero at the top. A server synchronized to a stratum n server {{will be running}} at stratum n + 1. The number represents {{the distance from the}} <b>reference</b> <b>clock</b> and is used to prevent cyclical dependencies in the hierarchy. Stratum is not always an indication of quality or reliability; it is common to find stratum 3 time sources that are higher quality than other stratum 2 time sources. (Telecommunication systems use a different definition for clock strata.) A brief description of strata 0, 1, 2 and 3 is provided below.|$|E

There are more complex codes, such as 8B/10B encoding, that use less bandwidth {{to achieve the same}} data rate but may be less tolerant of frequency errors and jitter in the transmitter and receiver <b>reference</b> <b>clocks.</b>|$|R
30|$|Timing {{synchronization}} can {{be achieved}} by using high accuracy <b>reference</b> <b>clocks,</b> such as rubidium oscillators or global positioning system (GPS) receiver. However, the rubidium oscillators are very expensive (in comparison with other components of the receiver) and very large. GPS receivers on the other hand are not able to operate indoors. Therefore we will take a distributed network synchronization approach.|$|R
50|$|By default, ports {{are driven}} at the tile's <b>reference</b> <b>clock.</b> However, clock block {{resources}} {{can be used}} to provide different clock signals, either by dividing the <b>reference</b> <b>clock,</b> or based on an external signal. Ports can be further configured to use buffering and to synchronise with other ports. This configuration is performed using library functions.|$|E

40|$|We scrutinize {{congruence}} {{as one of}} {{the basic}} definitions of equality in geometry and pit it against physics of Special Relativity. We show that two non-rigid rods permanently kept congruent during their common expansion or compression may have different instantaneous proper lengths (when measured at the same time of their respective <b>reference</b> <b>clocks)</b> if they have different mass distributions over their lengths. Alternatively, their proper lengths can come out equal only when measured at different but strictly correlated moments of time of their respective clocks. The derived expression for the ratio of instantaneous proper lengths of two permanently congruent changing objects explicitly contains information about the objects mass distribution. The same is true for the ratio of readings of the two <b>reference</b> <b>clocks,</b> for which the instantaneous measurements of respective proper lengths produce the same result. In either case the characteristics usually considered as purely kinematic depend on mass distribution, which is a dynamic property. This is a spectacular demonstration of dynamic aspect of geometry already in the framework of Special Relativity. Comment: 16 pages, PDF file, with 6 figures; typos correcte...|$|R

50|$|Such time {{dilation}} {{has been}} repeatedly demonstrated, for instance by small disparities {{in a pair}} of atomic clocks after one of them is sent on a space trip, or by clocks on the Space Shuttle running slightly slower than <b>reference</b> <b>clocks</b> on Earth, or clocks on GPS and Galileo satellites running slightly faster. Time dilation has also been the subject of science fiction works, as it technically provides the means for forward time travel.|$|R

50|$|BER and jitter are {{functions}} of the entire MGT connection, including the MGTs themselves, their serial lines, their <b>reference</b> <b>clocks,</b> their power supplies, and the digital systems that create and consume their parallel data. As a result, MGTs are often measured by how little jitter they transmit (Jitter Transfer/Jitter Generation), and how much jitter they can tolerate before their BER is too high (Jitter Tolerance). These measurements are commonly taken using a BERT, and analyzed using an Eye diagram.|$|R
50|$|Many {{services}} {{running on}} modern digital telecommunications networks require accurate synchronization for correct operation. For example, if switches {{do not operate}} with the same clock rates, then slips will occur and degrade performance. Telecommunication networks rely {{on the use of}} highly accurate primary <b>reference</b> <b>clocks</b> which are distributed network-wide using synchronization links and synchronization supply units. Ideally, the clocks are synchronous, but they may be mesochronous in practice. In common usage, mesochronous networks are often described as synchronous.|$|R
50|$|A general {{requirement}} for SyncE was that any network element (NE) {{should have at}} least two <b>reference</b> <b>clocks,</b> and in addition, Ethernet interfaces must be able to generate their own synchronization signal in case they lose their external reference. If such is the case, it is said that the Ethernet node (EN) is in holdover. The synchronous signal must be filtered and regenerated by phase locked loop (PLL) at the Ethernet nodes since it degrades when passing through the network.|$|R
5000|$|The {{superior}} close-in {{phase noise}} {{performance of a}} DDS {{stems from the fact}} that it is a feed-forward system. In a traditional phase locked loop (PLL), the frequency divider in the feedback path acts to multiply the phase noise of the reference oscillator and, within the PLL loop bandwidth, impresses this excess noise onto the VCO output. A DDS on the other hand, reduces the <b>reference</b> <b>clock</b> phase noise by the ratio [...] because its output is derived by fractional division of the clock. <b>Reference</b> <b>clock</b> jitter translates directly to the output, but this jitter is a smaller percentage of the output period (by the ratio above). Since the maximum output frequency is limited to , the output phase noise at close-in offsets is always at least 6dB below the <b>reference</b> <b>clock</b> phase-noise.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} provide evenly spaced {{measurements}} will the <b>reference</b> <b>clock</b> be divided down to form the measurement rate, triggering the time-interval counter (ARM input). This rate can be 1 Hz (using the 1 PPS output of a <b>reference</b> <b>clock)</b> but other rates like 10 Hz and 100 Hz can also be used. The speed of which the time-interval counter can complete the measurement, output the result and prepare itself for the next arm will limit the trigger frequency.|$|E
5000|$|Native TDM {{networks}} rely on hierarchical {{distribution of}} timing. Somewhere {{in the network}} {{there is at least}} one extremely accurate primary <b>reference</b> <b>clock</b> with a long-term accuracy of 1 x 10^-11. This node, which offers Stratum 1 accuracy, provides the <b>reference</b> <b>clock</b> to secondary nodes with Stratum 2 accuracy. The secondary nodes then provide a time reference to Stratum 3 nodes. This hierarchy of time synchronization is essential for the proper functioning of the network as a whole.|$|E
