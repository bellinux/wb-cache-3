50|$|Hot <b>rolled</b> <b>metals</b> {{generally}} have little directionality in their mechanical properties and deformation induced residual stresses. However, in certain instances non-metallic inclusions will impart some directionality and workpieces less than 20 mm thick often have some directional properties. Also, non-uniform cooling will induce {{a lot of}} residual stresses, which usually occurs in shapes that have a non-uniform cross-section, such as I-beams. While the finished product is of good quality, the surface is covered in mill scale, which is an oxide that forms at high temperatures. It is usually removed via pickling or the smooth clean surface process, which reveals a smooth surface. Dimensional tolerances are usually 2 to 5% of the overall dimension.|$|E

A model for shear band propagation at angles other than the principal resolved stress is presented which allows the shear strength of a particular texture component to be evaluated in terms including an in-plane shear stress component existing between adjacent laminae. Flow localisation {{in the form of}} a shear band occurs when a reduced number of slip systems necessary to accomplish the shear coincides with the minima in shear strength. The model is derived from the behaviour of the { 111 } 〈 112 〉 rolling deformation texture formed in α-brass which shears at 35 ° and is applied to another alloy system, PbCaSn, which shears at ~ 30 °.

40|$|In the {{previous}} works, {{the criterion for}} the fatigue strength of unnotched specimens under combined stress was proposed and treated separately from that of notched specimens, {{but it has been}} found that the former criterion is a special case of the latter. It has been also found {{that as long as the}} torsional fatigue strength is determined carefully, the same criterion can be applied to the results of both fracture and nonfracture tests, although the criterion was originally proposed for the case where the fatigue strength is defined to be the stress below which no 0. 1 mm slip-band cracks initiate. Slip-band cracks were found fractographically to correspond to the so-called stage I cracks. From several experimental results appeared in the literature, the criterion has been confirmed to be also applicable generally to the rolled steel products in spite of the fact that <b>rolled</b> <b>metals</b> possess inevitably the anisotropy due to rolling. Finally, it was concluded that the proposed criterion alone can be used successfully to estimate the fatigue strength under the combined stress state of bending and torsion, within experimental errors, for both ductile and brittle materials instead of using different empirical formulae which had been adopted previously...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the deformation orientation distribution function (ODF) and the primary recrystallised ODF in cold and warm <b>rolled</b> <b>metals,</b> {{is not a simple}} mathematical transformation from one to the other, but is through thermally activated processes occurring in the deformation microstructure. In BCC metals the mature rolling microstructure consists of cells, microbands and shear bands on a length scale of fraction of a micron, to deformation and transition bands at the grain scale, when this is of the order of 10 or more microns. There is evidence that grain boundary regions are sometimes distinct from grain interiors. Wherever there is a relatively sharp change in either orientation or microstructure such locations are potential sites of recrystallisation nuclei. In this paper the results of a systematic investigation of the development of microstructure in rolled interstitial free (IF) steel using both transmission and scanning electron microscopy are presented. It is shown how the dislocation mesh structure, formed at the earliest stages of rolling, develops into the mature microstructure consisting of cells, microbands and shear bands. Deformation heterogeneities in the microstructure, known to be of vital significance in the recrystallisation process are associated with the a and y fibre components of the rolling texture. Shear band thickening and a grain fragmentation are also considered, since both processes can produce recrystallisation nuclei, which in the a fibre case can reduce desirable mechanical properties. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacture}} of copper alloy flat <b>rolled</b> <b>metals</b> involves {{hot and cold}} rolling operations, together with annealing and other secondary processes, to transform castings (mainly slabs and cakes) into such shapes as strip, plate, sheet, etc. Production is mainly to customer orders {{in a wide range}} of specifications for dimensions and properties. However, order quantities are often small and so process planning plays an important role in this industry. Much research work has been done in the past in relation to the technology of flat rolling and the details of the operations, however, there is little or no evidence of any research in the planning of processes for this type of manufacture. Practical observation in a number of rolling mills has established the type of manual process planning traditionally used in this industry. This manual approach, however, has inherent drawbacks, being particularly dependent on the individual planners who gain their knowledge over a long span of practical experience. The introduction of the retrieval CAPP approach to this industry was a first step to reduce these problems. But this could not provide a long-term answer because of the need for an experienced planner to supervise generation of any plan. It also fails to take account of the dynamic nature of the parameters involved in the planning, such as the availability of resources, operation conditions and variations in the costs. The other alternative is the use of a generative approach to planning in the rolling mill context. In this thesis, generative methods are developed for the selection of optimal routes for single orders and then for batches of orders, bearing in mind equipment restrictions, production costs and material yield. The batch order process planning involves the use of a special cluster analysis algorithm for optimal grouping of the orders. This research concentrates on cold-rolling operations. A prototype model of the proposed CAPP system, including both single order and batch order planning options, has been developed and tested on real order data in the industry. The results were satisfactory and compared very favourably with the existing manual and retrieval methods...|$|E

At {{an amount}} of metals, {{as well as other}} materials, very strong {{pressure}} causes, (over 10000 atmospheres, instead of a density increase a decrease [with (NH 4) 2 SO 4 for example: 1. 773 to 1. 750). For these by the author, as well as feature examined more near by KAHLBAUM is tried an explanation, by being brought in compound/connection with the variation in volume with melting. It assumed that perfectly spherical bodies under the influence of an all-sided working strong pressure partly do not arrive at "flowing", thus a change of their molecular structure {{in the sense of a}} reduction that is experienced viscosity (pseudo fusion). If this view applies, then bodies, which expand when melting, must experience a volume increase with strong pressure also and in reverse. This consequence is confirmed by the experience. Examples of the first type are tin, lead, cadmium, silver, during bismuth when melting pull together and accordingly also with strong pressure at density increase. Author made wires of different metals, by being pressed by close openings, and observed the fact that Bi-wire was first completely flexible and returned only to some bends to the brittle condition whereby the acceptance by high pressure caused one flowing is supported. The obtained wires were divided ever into 2 parts, and heats one half up to near the melting point, whereby S. c. returned to the normal condition. If one dipped now the "started" and the "fluent" wire together into a salt solution of the same metal, then a weak current could be proven by means of a sensitive galvanometer. The voltage/tension amounts to the following: with tin 0. 11, lead 0. 12, cadmium 0. 20, silver 0. 98, bismuth 0. 385 milivolts. With the four first, lower volume increase melting metals the "fluent" wire cathode was, with bismuth anode. Similar results were obtained with polished metal bars and rolled out volumes.

One must "protect" from this between firm, in which a metal cannot experience noticeable deformation, and which "apparent" firm differentiates, which by the loss of crystalline structure and the ability of flowing is characterized. Certain materials go possessing easily into this condition over (plastic metals), during different this ability in very small measure or at all; materials of the latter type (coal, sand) cannot be combined also through still so high pressure to a uniform mass.
