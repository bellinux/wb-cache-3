2500|$|Refrigeration is {{the process}} of {{removing}} heat from an enclosed space, or from a substance, and moving it to a place where it is unobjectionable. The primary purpose of refrigeration is lowering the temperature of the enclosed space or substance and then maintaining that lower temperature. The American inventor Oliver Evans, acclaimed as the [...] "father of refrigeration", invented the vapor-compression <b>refrigeration</b> <b>machine</b> in 1805. Heat would be removed from the environment by recycling vaporized refrigerant, where it would move through a compressor and condenser, where it would eventually revert to a liquid form in order to repeat the refrigeration process over again. However, no such refrigeration unit was built by Evans. In 1834, Jacob Perkins modified Evans' original design, building the world's first refrigerator and filing the first legal patent for refrigeration using vapor-compression. John Gorrie, an American doctor from Florida, invented the first mechanical refrigeration unit in 1841, based on Evans' original invention to make ice in order to cool the air for yellow fever patients. Gorrie's mechanical refrigeration unit was issued a patent in 1851. American professor Alexander C. Twining of Cleveland, Ohio patented an early vapor-compression refrigerator in 1853 that was fully capable of producing a ton of ice per day. In 1913, refrigerators for home and domestic use were invented by Fred W. Wolf of Fort Wayne, Indiana with models consisting of a unit that was mounted on top of an ice box. A self-contained refrigerator, with a compressor {{on the bottom of the}} cabinet was invented by Alfred Mellowes in 1916. Mellowes produced this refrigerator commercially but was bought out by William C. Durant in 1918, who started the Frigidaire Company in order to begin the first mass-production of refrigerators.|$|E

Fish drying is a non-stationary and non-reversible process, going on at the alternating (decreasing) speed, so calculation of kinetics process presents considerable difficulty. Fish muscle tissues refer to moist, colloid, capillary-porous bodies and moving forces of removing moisture at low temperature drying of such bodies is a moisture possession gradient. The drying process is characterized by the drying speed decreasing due to over drying of the fish upper layer. This is explained by its thickening and increasing resistance of moisture diffusion to the surface. The kinetics of the inner mass transference at low temperature fish drying may be described in general case by equation of moisture change speed at any body poin...|$|R
