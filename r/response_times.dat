5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced <b>response</b> <b>times.</b>|$|E

Index terms: item response theory (IRT), <b>response</b> <b>time</b> modeling, parameter estimation, EM algorithm In psychophysics and cognitive psychology, <b>response</b> <b>time</b> has long been a research topic of interest. Psychologists who study <b>response</b> <b>time</b> are mainly interested in inferring the organization of the mental process from the distribution of <b>response</b> <b>time</b> to different components of the mental process (e. g., Luce, 1986). A general result from this research is the well-known speed-accuracy trade-off function (SATF), which describes how a respondent’s accuracy in performing certain tasks changes as the <b>response</b> <b>time</b> changes (see Luce, 1986, p. 81; Roskam, 1997).

To gain insight on the validity of this phenomenon and test the effect of <b>response</b> <b>time</b> on choice randomness, this study makes use of a recently conducted choice experiment survey on ecological and amenity effects of an offshore windfarm in the UK. The positive relationship between self-rated and inferred attribute attendance and <b>response</b> <b>time</b> is taken as evidence for a link between <b>response</b> <b>time</b> and cognitive effort. Subsequently, the generalised multinomial logit model is employed to test the effect of <b>response</b> <b>time</b> on scale, which indicates {{the weight of the}} deterministic relative to the error component in the random utility model. Results show that longer <b>response</b> <b>time</b> increases scale, i. e. decreases choice randomness. This positive scale effect of <b>response</b> <b>time</b> is further found to be non-linear and wear off at some point beyond which extreme <b>response</b> <b>time</b> decreases scale. While <b>response</b> <b>time</b> does not systematically affect welfare estimates, higher <b>response</b> <b>time</b> increases the precision of such estimates. These effects persist when self-reported choice certainty is controlled for. Implications of the results for online stated preference surveys and further research are discussed...|$|R

In such an environment, the information server cannot afford to serve the requests from a large population of users individually. Instead, the server uses a broadcast channel to deliver information to all users. A single transmission of a data item satisfies all pending requests for that item. The <b>response</b> <b>time</b> of a request depends on the broadcast time of the desired data item, which is scheduled by the server according to the overall demands for various data items.
