2500|$|Three dual-gimbal CMGs were {{mounted on}} the {{equipment}} rack of the Apollo Telescope Mount at {{the hub of the}} windmill-shaped array of solar panels {{on the side of the}} station. [...] They were arranged so that the casings (and therefore the rotors when all gimbals were at their zero positions) pointed in three mutually perpendicular directions. [...] Since the units were dual-gimballed, each one could produce a torque about any axis at right angles to its <b>rotor</b> <b>axis,</b> thus providing some redundancy; if any one of the three failed, the combination of the remaining two could in general still produce a torque around any desired axis.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are other}} {{undesirable}} <b>rotor</b> <b>axis</b> configurations apart from saturation, notably anti-parallel alignments. [...] For example, if a spacecraft with two dual-gimbal CMGs {{gets into a}} state in which one rotor spin axis is facing directly forward, while the other rotor spin is facing directly aft (i.e. anti-parallel to the first), then all roll control will be lost. [...] This happens {{for the same reason}} as for saturation; the rotors can only produce gyroscopic torques at right angles to their spin axes, and here these torques will have no fore-and-aft components and so no influence on roll. [...] However, in this case the CMGs are not saturated at all; their angular momenta are equal and opposite, so the total stored angular momentum adds up to zero. Just as for saturation, however, and for exactly the same reasons, roll control will become increasingly difficult if the CMGs even approach anti-parallel alignment.|$|E
2500|$|The A-4's four blade rotor {{was mounted}} {{at the top}} of a three legged pylon. [...] The two rear legs were based on the upper {{fuselage}} longerons and the forward on the upper central fuselage. They positioned the rotor hub directly over the wing centre line and [...] behind the centre of gravity. [...] The [...] rotor had blades with an aspect ratio of less than 14. [...] They were of mixed construction, with steel main spars, two wooden subsidiary spars and covered in a mixture of ply and fabric. Their section was the airfoil used by the Cierva C.19. The blades were wire braced from above from an extension of the <b>rotor</b> <b>axis,</b> which leaned forwards with respect to the aircraft's axis by 2°. [...] These wires were steel but contained rubber dampers. Hinges (double Cardan shafts) provided both upwards and in-plane movement, the latter damped by springs; normally such deflections were about ±7°.|$|E
50|$|The rotor is {{a moving}} {{component}} of an electromagnetic {{system in the}} electric motor, electric generator, or alternator. Its rotation {{is due to the}} interaction between the windings and magnetic fields which produces a torque around the <b>rotor's</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{cyclogyro}} wing {{resembles a}} paddle wheel, with airfoils replacing the paddles. The airfoils' pitch (angle of attack) is adjusted either collectively (by {{means of a}} control ring with links to all blades, which is located eccentrically and variably relative to the <b>rotor's</b> <b>axis</b> of rotation) or the blades are individually adjustable in pitch and are adjusted continually by the control system as they move around the <b>rotor's</b> <b>axis.</b> In normal forward flight the airfoils are given a slight positive pitch at the upper and forward portions of their arc, producing lift and forward thrust. They are given flat or negative pitch at the bottom, and are [...] "flat" [...] {{through the rest of}} the circle to produce little or no lift in other directions. The pitch can be adjusted to change the thrust profile, allowing the cyclogyro to travel in any direction. Differential thrust between the two wings (one on either side of the fuselage) can be used to turn the aircraft around its vertical axis, although conventional tail surfaces are generally used as well.|$|R

2500|$|The flat sided {{fuselage}} of the A-4 {{was built}} around four tube steel longerons with internal tube bracing {{and covered with}} a mixture of fabric and plywood. A [...] M-26 (KIM) 7-cylinder radial engine was mounted in the nose, cowled in a Townend ring and with its output shaft pointing downwards at an angle of 4.5°. Its small, low wings were rectangular plan, wooden structures, each built around a pair of spars and braced from above by a pair of parallel struts, one from each spar to the upper fuselage longeron. They had 5° of dihedral but their semicircular tips were inclined upwards by a further 35°. Conventional ailerons occupying almost 30% of the overall wing area provided roll control. [...] There were two open cockpits in tandem, the forward, passenger seat ahead of the wing trailing edge and close to the <b>rotor</b> <b>axis.</b> Dual control was fitted. At the rear the fin was long, rounded at the front but with a flat top. It mounted an unbalanced rudder, roughly rectangular though rounded at the rear corners, which extended to the keel. [...] Small like the wing, the tailplane was braced from below and had swept leading edges; its elevators were more generous, with rounded tips and a large cut-out for rudder movement.|$|E

50|$|The {{closely related}} split stator {{variable}} capacitor {{does not have}} the limitation of 90° angle since it uses two separate packs of rotor electrodes arranged axially behind one another. Unlike in a capacitor with several sections, the rotor plates in a split stator capacitor are mounted {{on opposite sides of the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>axis.</b> While the split stator capacitor benefits from larger electrodes compared to the butterfly capacitor, as well as a rotation angle of up to 180°, the separation of rotor plates incurs some losses since RF current has to pass the <b>rotor</b> <b>axis</b> instead of flowing straight through each rotor vane.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the first}} U.S. {{military}} helicopter in service {{with a significant}} transport capability, the HRP-1 was immediately put to use transporting cargo and personnel. Although referred to officially as the HRP-1, or [...] "Harp", the helicopter's distinctive shape, with no protruding nose beyond the forward <b>rotor's</b> <b>axis,</b> soon earned it the nickname [...] "The Flying Banana". The first HRP-1 Rescuer flew on 15 August 1947, and a second batch of 10 was built later, with the final machine delivered in 1949. All were powered by the 600 hp Pratt & Whitney R-1340-AN-1 engine.|$|R
5000|$|So called 'brushless synchros' use rotary {{transformers}} (that have no magnetic {{interaction with}} the usual rotor and stator) to feed power to the rotor. These transformers have stationary primaries, and rotating secondaries. The secondary is somewhat like a spool wound with magnet wire, the axis of the spool concentric with the <b>rotor's</b> <b>axis.</b> The [...] "spool" [...] is the secondary winding's core, its flanges are the poles, and its coupling does not vary significantly with rotor position. The primary winding is similar, surrounded by its magnetic core, and its end pieces are like thick washers. The holes in those end pieces align with the rotating secondary poles.|$|R

5000|$|Three rotors. An {{uncommon}} configuration; the 1948 Cierva Air Horse {{had three}} rotors {{as it was}} not believed a single rotor of sufficient strength could be built for its size. All three rotors turned {{in the same direction}} and yaw compensation was provided by inclining each <b>rotor</b> <b>axis</b> to generate rotor thrust components that opposed torque.|$|E
50|$|Torque balance was {{provided}} by slightly inclining each <b>rotor</b> <b>axis</b> to generate horizontal thrust components to provide anti-torque moments. The three rotor configuration was foreseen by Belgian helicopter experimenter Nicolas Florine in his patent of 1926 which presented the aforementioned means for balancing the reaction on the fuselage {{of two or more}} torque driven lifting rotors turning in the same direction.|$|E
50|$|Continuous-flow VADs {{are smaller}} and {{have proven to}} be more durable than pulsatile VADs. They {{normally}} use either a centrifugal pump or an axial flow pump. Both types have a central rotor containing permanent magnets. Controlled electric currents running through coils contained in the pump housing apply forces to the magnets, which in turn cause the rotors to spin. In the centrifugal pumps, the rotors are shaped to accelerate the blood circumferentially and thereby cause it to move toward the outer rim of the pump, whereas in the axial flow pumps the rotors are more or less cylindrical with blades that are helical, causing the blood to be accelerated {{in the direction of the}} <b>rotor's</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|R

A simple analytical model of cycloidal rotor aeromechanics is provided to support its sizing. The analytical model is validated using other approaches of increasing complexity and experimental results. Three anti-torque configurations are considered: a single vertical <b>axis</b> <b>rotor</b> at the tail, a single longitudinal <b>axis</b> <b>rotor</b> at the tail, and two sideways <b>axis</b> <b>rotors</b> at {{both sides of the}} airframe. The first and the last configurations are analyzed in more detail.

5000|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is actually}} a hull, which makes use of a semi-monocoque light alloy construction; according to aerospace publication Flight International, the hull design was [...] "reminiscent of flying-boat engineering". The main cabin lacks any transverse bracing, except for a single bulkhead between the cockpit and cabin. Substantial built-up frames connect the strengthened roof structure with the floor/planing-bottom of transverse under-floor bulkheads and outer skin. A conventional exterior skin is used, employing longitudinal stiffeners {{as well as two}} lines of deep channel members, while the under-floor cross members are reinforced with vertical stiffeners. There is no keel, at the floor level there are horizontal members between frames which are stiffened by transverse shear angles. Flexible fuel cells are stored in four watertight under-floor compartments lying fore and aft of the <b>rotor</b> <b>axis,</b> while the floor itself is fitted with removable panels. A hatch set into the floor, positioned approximately underneath the <b>rotor</b> <b>axis,</b> is used for sling-load operations.|$|E
5000|$|Cyclorotor blades require support {{structure}} for their positioning {{parallel to the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>axis</b> of rotation. This structure, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "spokes," [...] adds to the parasite drag and weight of the rotor. Cyclorotor blades are also centrifugally loaded in bending (as opposed to the axial loading on propellers), which requires blades with an extremely high strength to weight ratio or intermediate blade support spokes. Early 20th century cyclorotors featured short blade spans, or additional {{support structure}} to circumvent this problem.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sedimentation}} speed [...] (in m/s) is {{also known}} as the terminal velocity. It is constant because the force applied to a particle by gravity or by a centrifuge (measuring typically in multiples {{of tens of thousands of}} gravities in an ultracentrifuge) is cancelled by the viscous resistance of the medium (normally water) through which the particle is moving. The applied acceleration a (in m/s2) can be either the gravitational acceleration g, or more commonly the centrifugal acceleration [...] In the latter case, [...] is the angular velocity of the rotor and r is the distance of a particle to the <b>rotor</b> <b>axis</b> (radius).|$|E

50|$|A {{power system}} {{consists}} {{of a number of}} synchronous machines operating synchronously under all operating conditions. Under normal operating conditions, the relative position of the <b>rotor</b> <b>axis</b> and the resultant magnetic field axis is fixed. The angle between the two is known as the power angle or torque angle. During any disturbance, the rotor deaccelerates or accelerates with respect to the synchronously rotating air gap mmf, creating relative motion. The equation describing the relative motion is known as the swing equation, which is a non-linear second order differential equation that describes the swing of the rotor of synchronous machine. The power exchange between the mechanical rotor and the electrical grid due to the rotor swing (acceleration and deceleration) is called Inertial response.|$|E

50|$|The Picoo Z {{can reduce}} or {{increase}} the output through the tail rotor {{by means of}} an independent motor, allowing it to yaw left or right. Many full-sized (and model) rotorcraft have mechanically interconnected main and tail rotors so that when changing main rotor speed (and hence yaw torque), the tail rotor follows suit to compensate. Because the Picoo Z uses independent motors for the main and tail rotors, this interconnection (mixing) is electronically provided. Despite this, many users find that they must apply constant left or right stick to cause the tail rotor to spin at the appropriate speed to prevent it from spinning wildly along the <b>rotor</b> <b>axis.</b> However, with a little practice, most users find that they can easily compensate for any shortcomings of the electronic mixing.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{comparison of}} the output from the NPS developed Joint Army/Navy Rotorcraft Analysis and Design (JANRAD) computer code with H- 34 and UH- 60 A flight test data was made {{in an effort to}} determine the validity of the code's predictions. Airload distribution across the rotor disk, power required at various airspeeds ranging from hover to cruise, and thrust moment were used as measures of performance. Although a quantitative comparison of airload distribution is difficult to obtain, qualitatively, the predictions are good. JANRAD's power required estimations are correct to within two percent for altitudes below six thousand feet but accuracy suffers at higher altitudes, particularly above ten thousand feet. A correlation between the variation in kinematic viscosity from sea level to ten thousand feet and the accuracy of the power predictions is demonstrated. {{in the case of the}} UH- 60 A, the equivalent flat plate area of the helicopter is shown to be a function of airspeed, significantly impacting the accuracy of the power required prediction.

For example, if a spacecraft with two dual-gimbal CMGs {{gets into a}} state in which one rotor spin axis is facing directly forward, while the other rotor spin is facing directly aft (i.e. anti-parallel to the first), then all roll control will be lost. This happens {{for the same reason}} as for saturation; the rotors can only produce gyroscopic torques at right angles to their spin axes, and here these torques will have no fore-and-aft components and so no influence on roll. However, in this case the CMGs are not saturated at all; their angular momenta are equal and opposite, so the total stored angular momentum adds up to zero. Just as for saturation, however, and for exactly the same reasons, roll control will become increasingly difficult if the CMGs even approach anti-parallel alignment.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{delivery}} {{to a commercial}} operator, an A320neo to Lufthansa, occurred on January 20, 2016. This was instead of Qatar Airways due to rotor bow, or thermal bowing, due to asymmetrical cooling after shut-down on the previous flight. Differences in temperature across the shaft section supporting the rotor lead to different thermal deformation of the shaft material, causing the <b>rotor</b> <b>axis</b> to bend; this results in an offset between {{the center of gravity}} of the bowed rotor and the bearing axis, causing a slight imbalance and potentially reducing the tight clearance between the rotor blade tips and the compressor wall. All production standard engines now feature a damper on the third and fourth shaft bearings to help stiffen the shaft and data from engines in service and under accelerated testing is expected to gradually reduce engine start times. According to P&W President Bob Leduc, [...] "by the time we get to June (2016), it will be down to 200 seconds for start time {{and by the time we}} get to December (2016) we will be down to 150 seconds for start time".|$|E
