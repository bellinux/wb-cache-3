Quantifying the contribution of NTRs to egg production {{is the first step}} in evaluating the potential for <b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidy.</b> We quantified annual fecundity and egg production per unit area (EPUA) for the commercially important common coral trout, Plectropomus leopardus, between fished and NTR reefs in four Great Barrier Reef (GBR) regions. Reproductive potential between NTRs and fished reefs varied significantly among latitudes. Fecundity was approximately 200 % greater and EPUA 260 % greater on NTRs than fished reefs in the central GBR. Annual fecundity and EPUA were significantly greater on fished reefs than NTRs in the northern GBR. It was difficult to detect differences between NTRs and fished reefs in the southern GBR because of small numbers of spawners available to measure fecundity, despite overall greater abundances in the south. Plectropomus leopardus densities were 2 - 5 times lower in the central GBR than the north or south but higher proportions of reproductively mature females meant EPUA on central GBR NTRs was 1800 - 4500 % greater than on NTR reefs in the two southern regions and 530 % greater than reefs in the northern region. Male biased sex ratios, infrequent spawning, and low annual fecundity in the southern GBR limited the prospective reproductive benefits expected from significantly higher population densities. This study highlights the importance of considering spatial variation in EPUA when assessing prospective benefits of NTRs, particularly if <b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidy</b> is an objective of NTR implementation...|$|E

40|$|Increases in {{the numbers}} and sizes of predatory fishes in well {{established}} no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) on coral reefs are well-known. However, few studies have investigated whether adult spillover or <b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidies</b> lead to higher adult and juvenile densities in fished areas adjacent to MPAs, compared with fished sites further away from MPAs. Our understanding of these phenomena has been limited because most MPA studies have been restricted to comparisons of MPAs and fished areas, and do not consider fished areas that do not benefit from MPAs. On the Great Barrier Reef, adults of two recreationally important coral reef fish (Plectropomus maculatus and Lutjanus carponotatus) have been observed to increase in numbers in inshore no-take areas (“green zones”). In this thesis I made a preliminary investigation {{of the potential for}} adult spillover and <b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidies</b> by comparing fished areas, near to and distant from green zones. Firstly, I examined the early age and growth of juvenile fishes at the Keppel Islands, in order to define the size of young-of-the-year (0 +) and estimate settlement and spawning periods. I used this information to estimate the densities of adults and 0 + year fish within green zones, fished areas within 1 km from green zones and at sites greater than 5 km from the nearest protected area. The size-age relationships for the 0 + year cohorts were determined by studies of sectioned sagittal otoliths. Juveniles were collected between October and November in 2006, and May and June in 2007. The youngest P. maculatus and L. carponotatus recruits caught were 63 (53 mm FL) and 66 days old (49 mm FL) respectively, but ages extended to 334 days (220 mm FL) for P. maculatus and 345 days (183 mm FL) for L. carponotatus. Juvenile growth was rapid in both species, with P. maculatus and L. carponotatus averaging 0. 96 mm d- 1 and 0. 72 mm d- 1 respectively. The estimated PLD of P. maculatus was 28. 6 days, while L. carponotatus was 33. 6 days. Based on the observations from this study, recruitment surveys approximately two months after spawning would be sufficient, however, in order to include additional 0 + age cohorts, surveys would ideally take place 160 days after initial spawning. The potential for local benefits of MPAs were examined by comparing adult and recruit densities outside MPAs, both near to and distant from the MPA boundary. Adults and juveniles of P. maculatus and L. carponotatus were surveyed at both the Keppel Islands and Palm Islands, two inshore networks of no-take MPAs on the Great Barrier Reef. Within each region, the abundance and biomass of adults and recruits were compared for three treatments: (1) Within MPAs; (2) Nearby fished areas ( 5 km from MPA boundaries). Site variation accounted for the majority of differences in both adult and recruits of P. maculatus and L. carponotatus. Hence, {{no significant differences were found}} for any of the treatments. Low densities of juveniles and patchiness in their distribution appear to combine to make detecting <b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidies</b> extremely difficult.

Here, we develop a per-recruit model to evaluate the performance of no-take marine reserves protect-ing transient spawning aggregations. The model consists of only 14 demographic and exploitation-related parameters. We applied the model to a protogynous grouper and a gonochoristic rabbitfish from Seychelles and tested six scenarios regarding the extent of pro-tected areas, the level of fish spawning-site fidelity, and fishing effort redistribution post reserve implementation. Spawning aggregation reserves improve spawning-stock biomass-per-recruit and reduce the sex ratio bias in protogynous populations for all scenarios exam-ined. However, these benefits are often small and vary among the different scenarios and {{as a function of}} sexual ontogeny.

40|$|M. Com. (Development Economics) In {{recent years}} {{unemployment}} has received considerable international attention from scholars, policy makers, and labour practitioners, {{because it has}} reduced economic welfare, reduced output, and eroded human capital. Researchers argue that South Africa is faced with structural unemployment because of the insufficient demand for low-skilled resources and the sufficient demand for highly skilled resources. However, in terms of highly skilled resources, young South Africans have become better educated over the last decade, resulting in a significant growth {{in the size of}} the graduate labour force. This growth emanates particularly from the fact that the majority of the graduate labour force has completed their tertiary education. Despite this growth, graduate unemployment appears to be rising along with the overall unemployment rate. The aim of this study is to sensitise policy authorities to the impact of graduate unemployment on the economy by highlighting the perceived causes of graduate unemployment in South Africa’s banking sector. The research was conducted with the aid of a survey administered to two groups, namely a graduate group and a human resource (HR) manager group. The result derived from the research shows that the quality of tertiary institutions which relates to educational standards and culture, the quality of education, high expectations, a shortage of skills, a lack of work experience, and a lengthy process of application and job search are perceived to be the possible causes of graduate unemployment in South Africa. The study makes several tentative recommendations relating to what can possibly be done to reduce graduate unemployment. Among the recommendations proposed are the improvement of the quality of education and institutions, a well-planned career guidance mechanism, and a graduate <b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Times of high {{unemployment}} always inspire debates {{on the role}} of labor market policy and its optimal implementation. This paper uses a dynamic model of search unemployment and bilateral wage bargaining, rich enough to analyze a set of policy instruments with respect to their employment and welfare effects: payroll, output and firing taxes as well as wage, hiring and <b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidies.</b> It is shown that in presence of unemployment benefits a first best implementation using only firing taxes - in the spirit of Blanchard and Tirole (2008) - is not possible if job acceptance is endogenous. However, the socially optimal allocation can be implemented - even if the Hosios-condition does not hold - using a mix of the aforementioned instruments unless firms are liquidity constrained. In a second exercise, the model is extended to allow for worker transitions between skill classes reflecting economic turbulence. It is shown that the effectiveness of intergroup redistribution schemes as suggested by Mortensen and Pissarides (2003) is considerably reduced in the presence of economic turbulence.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{overview}} of the job creation policies being used to address the high unemployment rate and number of xiagang in Shanghai. Using primarily Chinese language sources, the context of employment issues are discussed. This is followed by a brief analysis of each issue. Among the numerous setbacks caused by the ongoing reforms, xiagang and urban unemployment have become one of the most serious problems for the Chinese leadership. There are no panaceas on offer and just which combination of measures should be chosen is a matter for debate. Some combination of a less restrictive labour market, expansion of infrastructure investment and stimulation of re-employment involving public and private partnership in areas where the market is unlikely to generate spontaneously appears as a suitable way forward. <b>Recruitment</b> <b>subsidies</b> are not favoured as a solution while a focus retraining on smaller, well-targeted schemes for recognizable areas of skill shortages while simultaneously making counselling and job search advice more widely available is favoured. Finally, the Chinese government has recently shifted its development strategy from one of centring on economic growth to one aimed at the sustainable development of the society. Such a shift is appropriate and desirable for China as the move enables the nation to alleviate rather than aggravate the social problems arising from its high economic growth achieved during the past twenty years. While China defines unemployment differently to other countries and has the unique phenomenon of xiagang, this paper provides a platform for considering future policy development in the employment area.

40|$|Well-designed and {{effectively}} managed networks of marine reserves {{can be effective}} tools for both fisheries management and biodiversity conservation. Connectivity, the demographic linking of local populations through the dispersal of individuals as larvae, juveniles or adults, is a key ecological factor to consider in marine reserve design, since it {{has important implications for}} the persistence of metapopulations and their recovery from disturbance. For marine reserves to protect biodiversity and enhance populations of species in fished areas, they must be able to sustain focal species (particularly fishery species) within their boundaries, and be spaced such that they can function as mutually replenishing networks whilst providing <b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidies</b> to fished areas. Thus the configuration (size, spacing and location) of individual reserves within a network should be informed by larval dispersal and movement patterns of the species for which protection is required. In the past, empirical data regarding larval dispersal and movement patterns of adults and juveniles of many tropical marine species have been unavailable or inaccessible to practitioners responsible for marine reserve design. Recent empirical studies using new technologies have also provided fresh insights into movement patterns of many species and redefined our understanding of connectivity among populations through larval dispersal. Our review of movement patterns of 34 families (210 species) of coral reef fishes demonstrates that movement patterns (home ranges, ontogenetic shifts and spawning migrations) vary among and within species, and are influenced by a range of factors (e. g. size, sex, behaviour, density, habitat characteristics, season, tide and time of day). Some species move < 0. 1 – 0. 5 km (e. g. damselfishes, butterflyfishes and angelfishes), < 0. 5 – 3 km (e. g. most parrotfishes, goatfishes and surgeonfishes) or 3 – 10 km (e. g. large parrotfishes and wrasses), while others move tens to hundreds (e. g. some groupers, emperors, snappers and jacks) or thousands of kilometres (e. g. some sharks and tuna). Larval dispersal distances tend to be < 5 – 15 km, and self-recruitment is common. Synthesising this information allows us, for the first time, to provide species, specific advice on the size, spacing and location of marine reserves in tropical marine ecosystems to maximise benefits for conservation and fisheries management for a range of taxa. We recommend that: (i) marine reserves should be more than twice the size of the home range of focal species (in all directions), thus marine reserves of various sizes will be required depending on which species require protection, how far they move, and if other effective protection is in place outside reserves; (ii) reserve spacing should be < 15 km, with smaller reserves spaced more closely; and (iii) marine reserves should include habitats that are critical to the life history of focal species (e. g. home ranges, nursery grounds, migration corridors and spawning aggregations), and be located to accommodate movement patterns among these. We also provide practical advice for practitioners on how to use this information to design, evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of marine reserve networks within broader ecological, socioeconomic and management contexts...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Feral {{populations of}} {{cultivated}} crops can pose challenges to novel trait confinement within agricultural landscapes. Simulation models {{can be helpful}} in investigating the underlying dynamics of feral populations and determining suitable management options. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a stage-structured matrix population model for roadside feral alfalfa populations occurring in southern Manitoba, Canada. The model accounted for the existence of density-dependence and <b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidy</b> in feral populations. We used the model to investigate the long-term dynamics of feral alfalfa populations, and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} simulated management strategies such as herbicide application and mowing in controlling feral alfalfa. Results suggest that alfalfa populations occurring in roadside habitats can be persistent and less likely to go extinct under current roadverge management scenarios. Management attempts focused on controlling adult plants alone can be counterproductive due to the presence of density-dependent effects. Targeted herbicide application, which can achieve complete control of seedlings, rosettes and established plants, will be an effective strategy, but the seedbank population may contribute to new recruits. In regions where roadside mowing is regularly practiced, devising a timely mowing strategy (early- to mid-August for southern Manitoba), one that can totally prevent seed production, will be a feasible option for managing feral alfalfa populations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Feral alfalfa populations can be persistent in roadside habitats. Timely mowing or regular targeted herbicide application will be effective in managing feral alfalfa populations and limit feral-population-mediated gene flow in alfalfa. However, in the context of novel trait confinement, the extent to which feral alfalfa populations need to be managed will be dictated by the tolerance levels established by specific production systems for specific traits. The modelling framework outlined in this paper could be applied to other perennial herbaceous plants with similar life-history characteristics...|$|E
40|$|No–take marine {{reserves}} {{have the}} potential to benefit fished species via the net export of adult fish (spillover) and/or eggs and larvae (<b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidy)</b> of target species from protected to fished areas. <b>Recruitment</b> <b>subsidy</b> from reserves is expected because fisheries generally remove the Big Old Fat Fecund Females (BOFFFs) selectively from a population. BOFFFs are expected to contribute disproportionately to reproductive output of populations by producing relatively better quality eggs, in greater quantities, compared with smaller and younger females. Quantifying the relative contribution of reserves to egg production is a crucial step in evaluating the potential for <b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidy</b> to occur. It is important when assessing any effect of reserves that appropriate spatial scales are used whereby, ideally, multiple reserves within the same ecosystem are assessed. This is important in egg production per unit area (EPUA) calculations because the reproductive dynamics of species that occur across broad spatial ranges often vary at a regional scale due to variation in environmental conditions. Such variation may complicate fisheries management if reserves created with the objective of enhancing EPUA of the target species are placed in areas where reproductive output is naturally limited, or where high adult fish densities represent larval sinks, not larval sources. Furthermore, comparisons of EPUA between fished and reserve reefs may be confounded where reproductive data are collected only from fished areas, thereby ignoring potential fishing-related effects such as density-dependent reproduction, Allee-type depensation, altered spawning behaviour, and skewed sex ratios for hermaphroditic species. In this thesis, I present extensive information on the reproductive biology of the common coral trout Plectropomus leopardus [Lacépède 1802], on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR). P. leopardus is a valuable food fish in the tropics and the major target species of both recreational and commercial line fisheries on the GBR. The species occurs throughout the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) across 14 ° of latitude and is a protogynous hermaphrodite. The objectives of this thesis were to: determine the relationships between maternal traits of P. leopardus and egg quantity and quality; compare these relationships at an appropriate spatial scale; test for the existence of BOFFFs; and estimate EPUA for P. leopardus along the GBR. The GBRMP is an excellent study site as the extensive network of no-take reserves offers access to comparable fished and reserve (protected) reefs. The vast area also allows environmental and fishing pressure influences to be tested on a regional scale. In Chapter 2, I quantify the effects of length and age on the sex ratio, proportion of vitellogenic females, and spawning frequency of P. leopardus on fished and reserve reefs in the northern, central and southern GBR. In Chapter 3, I outline a new method that uses the ratio of the number of migratory nuclei to the number of hydrated oocytes to estimate batch fecundity of P. leopardus. Previous estimates of batch fecundity were biased due to a small sample size, reliant on sampling the few hours prior to dusk spawning when the maximum number of hydrated oocytes is present in the ovary. My new method increases the time during the day over which samples can be collected and, therefore, increases the sample size available and reduces biases in batch fecundity estimates. This method was used in Chapter 4 to quantify the relationships between length, weight and age with batch fecundity of female P. leopardus on fished and reserve reefs in the northern, central and southern GBR. Maternal effects also are widely known to influence egg quality, and therefore the early life history traits of offspring. In Chapter 5, I examined the maternal effects of length, weight, age, and hepatosomatic index with indicators of egg quality (egg size, oil droplet size, total lipid content and lipid classes) for P. leopardus. Chapter 6 combined a 10 -year length-density data set with reproductive data from Chapters 2 – 4 of this thesis to quantify EPUA of P. leopardus in fished and reserve reefs in the northern, central and southern GBR. Despite the broad distribution of P. leopardus along the GBR, reproductive potential of females was maximized in the central section, particularly in the absence of fishing. Length, weight, and age had positive effects on batch fecundity of females from northern and central reefs but negligible effects on spawners from southern reefs. The proportion of vitellogenic females increased with length and age, as did the proportion of males in the population (as expected for a protogyne). However, female-male sex change occurred at smaller sizes and younger ages in the southern GBR, particularly on fished reefs. P. leopardus spawned most frequently on central reserve reefs (every 2. 3 days during the spawning season) and as infrequently as once every 2 – 3 months in the southern GBR regardless of reserve status. No effect of length on spawning frequency was detected. Maternal length and/or weight also had positive effects on indicators of egg quality, including egg size, oil droplet size, and the proportion of long-term storage lipid wax esters within the egg. Large female P. leopardus in the central GBR, therefore, generally produce more eggs, and eggs with enhanced provisioning, providing a potential advantage for larvae during the critical transition to successful exogenous feeding. Male biased sex ratios and low individual female fecundity in the southern GBR limited the reproductive benefits expected from higher population densities or larger fish in reserves. Egg production per unit area was greatest on reserve reefs in the central GBR where on average an estimated 800 000 oocytes 250 m⁻² year⁻¹ were produced, and lowest on southern GBR reefs where average EPUA was approximately 30 000 oocytes 250 m⁻² year⁻ 1.

40|$|Many {{coral reef}} fish form {{transient}} spawning aggregations at sites located {{a few to}} hundreds of kilometres from their normal residence areas. Reef fish spawning aggregations ("FSAs") are often heavily exploited, which make them targets for management with marine reserves. We used a per-recruit model to compare the long-term conservation (impacts on female spawning-stock biomass-per-recruit (SSBR) and female : male sex ratio, SR) and fisheries effects (impacts on yield-per-recruit, YPR) of spawning reserves vs. normal residence reserves for two data-poor populations from Seychelles with contrasting life history traits and sexual modes: the Siganus sutor population of the main granitic islands, which has a fast life history and is gonochoristic and the Epinephelus fuscoguttatus population of Farquhar Atoll, which has a slow life history and is protogynous. Overall, our results suggest that normal residence reserves are more effective at improving both the SSBR and YPR of S. sutor. In contrast, the protection of a substantial fraction of spawning sites is preferable for E. fuscoguttatus to ensure the reproductive output of this protogynous population through normalization of SR and maintenance of high SSBR. Neither spawning reserves nor normal residence reserves improved the YPR of E. fuscoguttatus. However, yields of E. fuscoguttatus may increase on the long term via <b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidy</b> if a substantial fraction of spawning sites is protected. This may occur only if the population was recruitment limited {{in the absence of}} reserves and increases in SSBR compensate for lost opportunities caused by the area closures. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the relative effects of spawning reserves and normal residence reserves relate more to the change in catchability occurring with FSA formation than to life history traits. Thus, normal residence reserves should be preferred over spawning reserves for S. sutor essentially because its catchability at spawning sites is low relative to many other aggregation-forming populations. S. sutor therefore suffers higher fishing mortality in normal residence areas than at FSA sites. Our study demonstrates that spawning reserves are not always the most effective tool for balancing conservation and exploitation objectives for FSA-forming populations, and that this measure should ideally be weighed against other management options...|$|E

40|$|No-take marine {{reserves}} (NTRs) {{are areas}} of the marine environment in which fishing and all other extractive activities are prohibited. In many regions of the world, NTRs are now relatively widespread and they {{are considered to be}} a fundamental tool in achieving sustainable management of marine habitats, communities and ecosystems. There is a wealth of evidence that networks of adequately protected NTRs can potentially buffer the negative effects of marine resource exploitation, protect or restore natural states of biodiversity and ecosystem function, and deal with many fishery problems that are not effectively addressed by more traditional management measures. It has been well documented that the abundance, average size, age and per-capita fecundity of fish species which are targeted by fisheries often increase significantly within adequately protected NTRs. It is expected that NTRs may also function to maintain and perhaps enhance fishery yields via recruitment subsidies to fished areas from enhanced populations within NTRs ('recruitment subsidy') and via net-emigration of post-settlement fish from reserves to surrounding fished areas ('spill-over effect'). However, due to the difficulties associated with tracking the dispersal of microscopic pelagic larvae in the marine environment, empirical demonstrations of the potential contribution of NTRs to enhancing fish populations in surrounding areas via <b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidy</b> remain elusive. This thesis builds on the body of evidence that adequately protected NTRs can generate benefits for exploited species by presenting fishery independent data on the effects of long term NTR protection (12 – 20 years) on fish populations within Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Data presented in Chapters 3, 4, and 5 was generated using standard underwater visual census (UVC) methodologies which have been widely used to assess patterns of distribution and abundance in reef fishes and to assess the structure of fish and benthic communities. The research presented here also extends to the development and testing of new tools for tracking fish larval dispersal and defining the demographic connectivity of fish populations. Chapters 6 and 7 of this thesis present the findings of two experiments which assessed the safety and effectiveness of transgenerational isotope labeling (TRAIL) of reef fish larvae using enriched stable isotopes of barium. The final data chapter of this thesis (Chapter 8) provides an overview of research currently underway which is attempting to demonstrate both NTR recruitment subsidies and spill-over effects for target fish species within the GBRMP. Chapter 3 of this thesis presents quantitative estimates, UVC data, of density and biomass of coral trout (Plectropomus spp.), the major target of the hook and line fisheries on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Data was collected from inshore fringing reefs of the Palm and Whitsunday Island groups, 3 - 4 years before (1983 - 1984), and 12 - 13 years after (1999 - 2000) the establishment of NTRs in 1987. Density and biomass of coral trout increased significantly (by factors of 5. 9 and 6. 3 in the Palm Islands and 4. 0 and 6. 2 in the Whitsunday Islands) in the NTR sites, but not the fished sites, between 1983 - 1984 and 1999 - 2000. In 1999 - 2000, density and biomass of coral trout, and a secondary target of the fisheries, the stripey snapper (Lutjanus carponotatus), were significantly higher in NTR zones than in the fished zones at both island groups. The density and biomass of non-target fish species (Labridae, Siganidae and Chaetodontidae) did not differ significantly between NTR and fished zones at either island group. Results are also presented for a range of other fish species and groups. Chapter 4 examines the short-term (bi-annual samples over a 3 year period) temporal dynamics of populations of Plectropomus spp., Lutjanus carponotatus, Siganidae and Chaetodontidae within NTR and fished zones of the Palm Island group. Although considerable temporal variation in mean density and biomass was detected for all fish groups, persistent and significant effects of NTR protection were evident for the target fish groups (Plectropomus spp. and L. carponotatus), while as expected, no clear effects of NTR protection were detected for the control (non-target) fish groups (Siganidiae and Chaetodontidae). It was determined that when examining the effects of NTR protection on fish populations, bi-annual UVC sampling of these reefs provided little, if any, benefit over once-yearly sampling. Quantitative estimates of fishing effort near NTRs and rates of zoning infringements (poaching) within the Palm Island group are also provided within chapter 4. It was calculated that the total fishing effort on the fringing reefs surrounding Pelorus Island (fished zone) was approximately 1164 vessels per year, while approximately 91 vessels per year were illegally fishing within the Orpheus Island NTR. Chapter 5 presents long-term (5 – 9 years) temporal UVC monitoring data for fish populations and the sessile benthic (coral) community on fringing reefs of the Palm, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. As in chapter 4, significant temporal variability in mean density and biomass was detected in all fish groups (Plectropomus spp., L. carponotatus, Siganidae, Chaetodontidae) and in the mean cover of live coral. However, the strong effects of NTR protection on target fish species persisted throughout the monitoring period in all three island groups. As previously shown, there were no detectable effects of NTR protection on non-target fish groups or on the benthic community. Data presented in chapters 3, 4 and 5 of this thesis have provided some of the most convincing evidence available that the management zoning of the GBRMP has been effective in protecting target fish species. Enhanced populations of exploited fish species within the NTRs examined here should lead to <b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidy</b> and spill-over benefits for surrounding fished areas. In order to begin examining export effects of NTRs it was necessary to develop and test techniques for tracking larvae of pelagic spawning fish in the marine environment. Injection of an enriched stable isotope barium chloride (BaCl ₂) solution into female marine fish has been shown to provide an effective chemical marker that is transmitted to developing eggs and is subsequently detectable in the otoliths of larvae and juveniles. The technique provides a new means of mass-marking larval fish and facilitates investigations of larval dispersal patterns, demographic population connectivity and export effects of NTRs. However, successful field applications must be preceded by trials of the technique on target species within controlled conditions. Chapter 6 of this thesis examines the toxicological and physiological responses of the common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus), to injection of enriched stable isotope BaCl ₂ solution. Thirty adult P. leopardus were subject to one of two ¹³⁸ BaCl ₂ injection treatment groups (corresponding to dosage rates of 2 mg and 4 mg ¹³⁸ Ba / kg body weight) and a control group in which fish were injected with 0. 9...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of reef fish populations at lower latitudes {{are not well}} understood, particularly in the Coral Triangle (composed of the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Timor Leste, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands), where the monsoons (shifting tradewinds) are potential drivers of seasonality of reproduction and recruitment. Such dynamics will also {{be influenced by the}} degree to which local populations self-replenish or rely on larval replenishment from other populations. However, few have investigated the effects of the monsoons on the replenishment of reef fish populations. Furthermore, the extent of ecologically-significant larval dispersal of reef fishes, in general, remains unclear. Understanding the patterns and key processes behind population replenishment and larval dispersal are critical to the application of no-take marine reserve networks as conservation and fisheries management tools. This thesis addresses knowledge gaps about the patterns of reproduction, recruitment and larval connectivity of reef fish populations in the central Philippines, the epicentre of reef fish biodiversity in the Coral Triangle. The questions that this thesis addresses are especially relevant to the use of notake marine reserves for reef conservation and fisheries management in the Philippines, a developing archipelagic nation with a vast coral reef area, a large and rapidly growing human population and a great number of small, community-based marine reserves. Most coastal communities in the Philippines are poor and have few employment alternatives. Many communities rely on coral reefs for food and livelihood. No-take marine reserves in the Philippines are regarded as a viable option to conserve and manage coral reefs that is acceptable to local stakeholders. This thesis consists of four related studies. In the first study, I tested the prevailing notion that spawning peaks of reef fish at lower latitudes are timed to take advantage of weaker winds during inter-monsoonal periods, supposedly to limit advection and enhance survivorship of larvae. The monthly spawning patterns of four species of reef fish (2 fusiliers, 1 surgeonfish and 1 damselfish) were studied for 11 - 22 months. All four species showed protracted spawning periods. However, results suggested that the monsoons affect reproduction in ways that are not consistent with the above hypothesis. Conditions advantageous to larval survival may not be restricted to the inter-monsoonal periods. An alternative explanation is that the spawning patterns probably reflected temperature, rainfall, wind or wave action more directly influencing the spawning of adults, as opposed to adaptation of the timing of reproduction to ensure higher survivorship of larvae in the pelagic environment. The complex effects of the monsoons on reproduction in reef fishes warrant further study. In the second study, I investigated the patterns of recruitment (larval settlement) of 120 species of reef fish almost every month for 20 consecutive months at two island and two coastal locations. Recruitment was found to occur throughout the year. Most species exhibited protracted recruitment seasons (up to 9 - 11 months). However, a predictable annual peak in community-wide recruitment of reef fishes was detected, coinciding with the weakening of monsoon winds and higher sea surface temperature. The annual pattern of recruitment was fairly consistent across 11 sites and between the two years sampled. The same recruitment pattern was also found in the two families that dominated monthly recruitment to reefs, the damselfishes and the wrasses, notwithstanding a 10 -fold difference in overall abundance of recruits of these two families. These findings implied a far-reaching influence of the monsoons on recruitment of reef fishes at lower latitudes. In the third study, I determined the extent of potential larval connectivity among reef fish populations across a 300 -km-wide region of the Bohol Sea in the central Philippine archipelago, by combining two very different methods: 1) analysis of species assemblage patterns (presence/absence of 216 species at 61 sampling sites) and associated habitat patterns; and 2) modelling of reef fish larval dispersal patterns. The results of the two methods independently suggested probable connectivity within a large group of sites situated in an internal sea where a dominant westward current is present. The presence of potentially significant connectivity among these sites, and their lack of strong connectivity with other sites were probably strongly influenced by the local oceanographic setting and habitat. The results were consistent with present knowledge of the spatial scales of ecologically-relevant larval dispersal in reef fishes (10 's of kilometres). The study provided a framework for connectivity within existing networks of no-take marine reserves in the region. In the final study, I estimated the probable extent of <b>recruitment</b> <b>subsidy</b> (net larval export) and larval connectivity of 39 small (< 1 km 2) no-take marine reserves within a more limited (135 x 70 km) region of the Bohol Sea in the central Philippines. The reserves were estimated to occupy about 6...|$|E
