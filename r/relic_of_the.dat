5|$|During {{the reign}} of Kithsirimevan (301–328), Sudatta, the sub king of Kalinga, and Hemamala brought the Tooth <b>Relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buddha to Sri Lanka because of unrest in their country. Kithsirimevan carried it in {{procession}} and placed the relic in a mansion named Datadhatughara. He ordered this procession to be held annually, and this is still done as a tradition in the country. The Tooth <b>Relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buddha soon {{became one of the}} most sacred objects in the country, and a symbol of kingship. The person who was in possession of the Tooth Relic would be the rightful ruler of the country. Therefore, it was often enshrined within the royal palace itself.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture began {{a search}} in China for ancient buildings. In the seventh {{year of the}} society's search in 1937, an {{architectural}} team led by Liang Sicheng discovered that Foguang Temple was a <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tang Dynasty. Liang was able to date the building after his wife found an inscription {{on one of the}} rafters. The date's accuracy was confirmed by Liang's study of the building which matched with known information about Tang buildings.|$|E

5|$|The ends of Norwich and Canterbury {{also have}} {{projecting}} chapels, that at Norwich being a Gothic {{addition to the}} Norman east end, while that at Canterbury, known as the Corona, being designed {{as part of the}} Early English plan, specifically to enshrine the <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crown of Thomas Becket’s skull, sliced off {{at the time of his}} assassination. The east ends of a number of other cathedrals, such as Durham, Peterborough and Gloucester, have been modified in various ways and do not fit any particular model.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} {{architecture}} of ancient Sri Lanka, vatadages were {{built for the}} protection of small stupas that had an important relic enshrined in them or were built on hallowed ground. If the Polonnaruwa Vatadage is the shrine built by Parakramabahu I, the <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth of the Buddha would have been enshrined within it. Another possibility is that the alms bowl used by the Buddha may have been enshrined here. Both these relics were important objects in ancient Sri Lankan culture, and would have made the Polonnaruwa Vatadage {{one of the most significant}} and venerated buildings in the country.|$|E
5|$|Aldwych is {{a closed}} {{station on the}} London Underground, located in the City of Westminster in Central London. It was opened in 1907 with the name Strand, after the street on which it is located, and was the {{terminus}} of the short Piccadilly line branch from Holborn that was a <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> merger of two railway schemes. The station building {{is close to the}} Strand's junction with Surrey Street, near Aldwych. During its lifetime, the branch {{was the subject of a}} number of unrealised extension proposals that would have seen the tunnels through the station extended southwards, usually to Waterloo.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey was {{a patron}} of scholarship, and {{employed}} scholars throughout his life, one of whom, Honorius of Kent, Geoffrey appointed Archdeacon of Richmond. Honorius was subsequently employed by Hubert Walter {{and wrote a}} legal work on canon law. The Leiden St Louis Psalter is a lavishly illuminated psalter made for the archbishop, probably in northern England in the 1190s, which passed {{into the hands of}} Blanche of Castile after Geoffrey's death, and, as religious manuscripts often were, was used to teach the future saint King Louis IX of France how to read, as recorded by a 14th-century inscription. After the king's death it passed through several royal owners, regarded as a <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saint, before reaching the University Library at Leiden in 1741.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius {{abandoned}} Syria {{with the}} holy <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> True Cross which was, along with other relics held at Jerusalem, secretly boarded on ship by Parthia of Jerusalem, just {{to protect it from}} the invading Arabs. It is said that the emperor had a fear of water. and a pontoon bridge was made for Heraclius to cross the Bosphorus to Constantinople. After abandoning Syria, the Emperor began to concentrate on his remaining forces for the defence of Anatolia and Egypt instead. Byzantine Armenia fell to the Muslims in 638–39, after which Heraclius created a buffer zone in central Anatolia by ordering all the forts east of Tarsus to be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|NGC 821 is an E6 {{elliptical}} galaxy. It {{is unusual}} {{because it has}} hints of an early spiral structure, which is normally only found in lenticular and spiral galaxies. NGC 821 is 2.6 by 2.0 arcminutes and has a visual magnitude of 11.3. Its diameter is 61,000 light-years and it is 80 million light-years away. Another unusual galaxy in Aries is Segue 2. Segue 2 is a dwarf galaxy that is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, recently discovered to be a potential <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epoch of reionization.|$|E

Some offers of marriage started to arrive from German princes, but she chose to return to Normandy. She {{does not appear to have}} expected to return to Germany, as she gave up her estates within the Empire and departed with her personal collection of jewels, her own imperial regalia, two of Henry's crowns, and the valuable <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hand of St James the Apostle.|$|E
5|$|The Castellania is {{considered}} as the masterpiece of architecture projected by Grand Master Pinto, {{being the most}} original intact of secular High Baroque architecture and a <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early modern period, {{under the rule of}} the Order of St. John. It has an elaborate façade designed to be imposing, of similar proportions to an auberge, and it is a prominent building in the area. It is two stories high, being built on three sides of a small courtyard at the rear. Although the building has an asymmetrical plan, the main façade in Merchants street is symmetrical. The design prominently includes sumptuous edges, spread over the exterior.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other {{orders of}} monks who allowed parishioners and {{visitors}} {{admission to the}} nave, the Cistercians officially reserved their churches solely {{for the use of}} the monastic community. Others had to worship in a separate chapel in the abbey grounds close to the main gate. Over time this rule was relaxed to allow pilgrims to visit shrines, as at Hailes Abbey with its <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Blood, and to allow the construction of tombs and chantries for patrons and wealthy benefactors of the house, as in the churches of other orders. Excavated sculpture shows that the church at Netley featured a number of elaborate tombs and monuments.|$|E
5|$|The Anuradhapura Kingdom (Sinhala: , Tamil:அனுராதபுர இராச்சியம்), {{named for}} its capital city, was the first {{established}} kingdom in ancient Sri Lanka and Sinhalese people. Founded by King Pandukabhaya in 377 BC, the kingdom's authority extended throughout the country, although several independent areas emerged from time to time, which grew more numerous {{towards the end of}} the kingdom. Nonetheless, the king of Anuradhapura was seen as the supreme ruler of the country throughout the Anuradhapura period. Buddhism played a strong role in the Anuradhapura period, influencing its culture, laws, and methods of governance. Society and culture were revolutionized when the faith was introduced during the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa; this cultural change was further strengthened by the arrival of the Tooth <b>Relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buddha in Sri Lanka and the patronage extended by her rulers.|$|E
5|$|The Shogunate took major steps {{towards the}} {{construction}} of a modern and powerful military: a navy with a core of eight steam warships had been built over several years and was already the strongest in Asia. In 1865, Japan's first modern naval arsenal was built in Yokosuka by the French engineer Léonce Verny. In January 1867, a French military mission arrived to reorganize the shogunal army and create the Denshūtai elite force, and an order was placed with the United States to buy the French-built ironclad warship CSS Stonewall, a <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Civil War. Due to the Western powers' declared neutrality, the Americans refused to release the ship, but once neutrality was lifted, the imperial faction obtained the vessel and employed it in engagements in Hakodate under the name Kōtetsu ("Ironclad").|$|E

5|$|The monastery {{itself was}} founded by Senekerim-Hovhannes early in his reign (1003–24) to house a <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> True Cross that had been kept on the site since Hripsime. In 1021, when Vaspurakan fell to Byzantine rule, Senekerim-Hovhannes took the relic to Sebastia, where the {{following}} year his son Atom founded the Surb Nshan Monastery. In 1025, following his death, Senekerim-Hovhannes was buried at Varagavank and the True Cross was returned to the monastery. Fearing an attack by Muslims, Varagavank Father Ghukas took the True Cross in 1237 to the Tavush region of northeastern Armenia. There he settled in the Anapat monastery, which was renamed Nor Varagavank. In 1318, the Mongols invaded the region and ransacked the monastery. All the churches were destroyed except St. Hovhannes, which had an iron door and was where the monks hid. Between 1320 and the 1350s, the monastery was completely restored.|$|E
5|$|Theories vary among {{archaeologists and}} historians {{regarding}} {{who built the}} Polonnaruwa Vatadage, and when. One such theory suggests that it was built by Parakramabahu I during his reign in the 12th century. The Culavamsa, an ancient chronicle, mentions that he built a circular stone shrine to hold the tooth <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buddha. Archaeologist Harry Charles Purvis Bell believed that this shrine is the Polonnaruwa Vatadage. This is contradicted by several ancient sources of the island, including Rajavaliya and Poojavaliya, which mention that it was built by Nissanka Malla. However, according to the studies of Arthur Maurice Hocart, Nissanka Malla only renovated an already existing building and made some additions such as the entrance and outer porch. Wilhelm Geiger, who translated the ancient Mahavamsa, and historian H. W. Codrington both agree with this theory. A nearby stone inscription set by Nissanka Malla lists the Vatadage among his constructions. In this, he claims that it was built {{by one of his}} generals under his own direction.|$|E
