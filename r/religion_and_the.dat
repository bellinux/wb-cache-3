5|$|As a {{token of}} respect for Roman religion, however, Elagabalus joined either Astarte, Minerva, Urania, or some {{combination}} of the three to Elagabal as consort. A union between Elagabal and a traditional goddess would have served to strengthen ties between the new <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> imperial cult. In fact, there may have been an effort to introduce Elagabal, Urania, and Athena as the new Capitoline triad of Rome—replacing Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.|$|E
5|$|Judah Philip Benjamin, QC (August 11, 1811 – May 6, 1884) was {{a lawyer}} and {{politician}} who was a United States Senator from Louisiana, a Cabinet officer of the Confederate States and, after his escape to the United Kingdom {{at the end of}} the American Civil War, an English barrister. Benjamin was the first Jew to be elected to the United States Senate who did not renounce the <b>religion,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first of that faith to hold a Cabinet position in North America.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} have described rationalisation {{and the question}} of individual freedom in an increasingly rational society, as the main theme of Weber's work.

5|$|The {{place name}} Orange has a {{separate}} etymology. The Roman-Celtic settlement {{was founded in}} 36 or 35 BC and originally named Arausio, after a Celtic water god. The Principality of Orange was named for this place {{and not for the}} color. Some time after the sixteenth century, though, the color orange was adopted as a canting symbol of the House of Orange-Nassau. The color eventually came to be associated with Protestantism, due to participation by the House of Orange on the Protestant side in the French Wars of <b>Religion</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dutch Eighty Years' War.|$|E

5|$|Three core {{principles}} {{establish a}} basis for Bahá'í teachings and doctrine: the unity of God, the unity of <b>religion,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> unity of humanity. From these postulates stems the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and to develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.|$|E
5|$|Although Sri Lankan Tamils are {{culturally}} and linguistically distinct, genetic {{studies indicate that}} they {{are closely related to}} Sinhalese ethnic group in the island. The Sri Lankan Tamils are mostly Hindus with a significant Christian population. Sri Lankan Tamil literature on topics including <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sciences flourished during the medieval period in the court of the Jaffna Kingdom. Since the beginning of the Sri Lankan Civil War in the 1980s, it is distinguished by an emphasis on themes relating to the conflict.

5|$|Belgrano studied {{near the}} {{intellectual}} elite of Spain, {{and by that}} time there were heated discussions about the ongoing French Revolution. The principles of equality and freedom, the universal scope of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and criticism of the divine right of kings were constant topics of debate. Among the supporters of these ideas it was thought that Spain should be remade under similar principles, and critics of such thought were rejected as tyrants or proponents of outdated ideas. However, the Spanish Enlightenment was slightly different from the French one as it still respected <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> monarchy. Thus, despite the new influences, Belgrano remained a strong Catholic and monarchist.|$|E

5|$|Beth Hamedrash was the prototypical American synagogue {{for early}} {{immigrant}} Eastern European Jews, who began entering the United States {{in large numbers}} only in the 1870s. They found the synagogues of the German Jewish immigrants who preceded them to be unfamiliar, both religiously and culturally. Russian Jews in particular had been more excluded from Russian society than were German Jews from German society, for both linguistic and social reasons. Unlike German Jews, the Jews who founded Beth Hamedrash viewed both <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> synagogue as central to their lives. They attempted to re-create in Beth Hamedrash the kind of synagogue they had belonged to in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{experimental}} {{support for this}} hypothesis, it remains controversial. A common critique is that devoutness is easy to fake, such as simply by attending a religious service. However, the hypothesis predicts that {{people are more likely}} to join and contribute to a religious group when its rituals are costly. Another critique specifically asks: why religion? There is no evolutionary advantage to evolving religion over other signals of commitment such as nationality, as Irons admits. However, the reinforcement of religious rites as well as the intrinsic reward and punishment system found in religion makes it an ideal candidate for increasing intragroup cooperation. Finally, there is insufficient evidence for increase in fitness as a result of religious cooperation. However, Sosis argues for benefits from religion itself, such as increased longevity, improved health, assistance during crises, and greater psychological well being though both the supposed benefits from <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> costly-signaling mechanism have been contested.|$|E
5|$|From the 17th century onward, the Enlightenment {{questioned}} {{the power and}} influence of the Catholic Church over Western society. In the 18th century, writers such as Voltaire and the Encyclopédistes wrote biting critiques of both <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church. One target of their criticism was the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes by King Louis XIV of France, which ended a century-long policy of religious toleration of Protestant Huguenots. The French Revolution of 1789 brought about a shifting of powers from the Church to the State, destruction of churches {{and the establishment of}} a Cult of Reason. In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte's General Louis Alexandre Berthier invaded Italy, imprisoning Pope Pius VI, who died in captivity. Napoleon later re-established the Catholic Church in France through the Concordat of 1801. The end of the Napoleonic Wars brought Catholic revival and the return of the Papal States.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, a New Year's Eve benefit {{event was}} held for the Council on <b>Religion</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Homosexual. Police stood outside with large floodlights, and {{in an effort to}} intimidate took {{photographs}} of anyone entering the building. Later, several officers demanded that they be allowed inside. Three lawyers explained to them that under California law, the event was a private party and they could not enter unless they bought tickets. The lawyers were then arrested. Several ministers who were in attendance held a press conference the next morning, likening the SFPD to the Gestapo. Even the Catholic archbishop strongly condemned the actions of the police. In an attempt to reduce such harassment two officers were tasked with improving the police department's relationship with the gay community.|$|E
5|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, the episode {{was seen by}} approximately 12.2million viewers, a drop from the previous episode which garnered 15.5million viewers. Following its broadcast, the episode received mixed reviews from critics, but won an Annie award {{in the category of}} Best Animated Television Production. In 2007, the episode was released as part of The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season DVD box set, and a promotional poster for the episode was included in an exhibition in Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The episode's ending scene is one of series creator Matt Groening's favorite moments on The Simpsons. The episode has been credited with fostering a critical literacy towards <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bible among its viewers.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, oaths {{were taken}} very seriously. As King, James was Head of the Church of Scotland or Kirk, sworn by his Coronation Oath to {{preserve}} its position and privileges. The Test Act required government officials and MPs to swear an Oath of Allegiance to the Protestant <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> monarch, regardless of personal religion. James thus received their support despite his own Catholicism but promised not to diminish {{the primacy of the}} Church of Scotland. Removing these restrictions was seen as contrary to that commitment. Many MPs were also members of the Episcopalian minority imposed on the Kirk in 1661; Argyll's defeat showed the weakening of Presbyterian influence but voting for these measures would undo that. James' credibility was seriously damaged, since he appeared willing to ignore his previous commitments, his Coronation Oath and his most loyal supporters.|$|E

5|$|The Constitution {{developed}} by the National Congress was implemented in July 1831. It guaranteed individual liberty, property rights, freedom of <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> press, and equality before the law. Because of its perceived balance between freedom and rule of law, it was praised by liberals {{around the world and}} promoted as a model for future constitutions. Under the new constitution, Belgium had two chambers, a Chamber of Representatives and Senate, both elected by a small number of wealthy citizens. The King was allowed substantial power in military affairs, but was given little independent power in any other sphere, which was instead given to the elected chambers.|$|E
5|$|The Vedic {{beliefs and}} {{practices}} of the pre-classical era were {{closely related to the}} hypothesised Proto-Indo-European <b>religion,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pre-Islamic Indo-Iranian religion. The earliest iconic artworks of Shiva may be from Gandhara and northwest parts of ancient India. There is some uncertainty as the artwork that has survived is damaged and they show some overlap with meditative Buddha-related artwork, but the presence of Shiva's trident and phallic symbolism in this art suggests it was likely Shiva. Numismatics research suggests that numerous coins of the ancient Kushan Empire that have survived, were images of a god who is probably Shiva. The Shiva in Kushan coins is referred to as Oesho of unclear etymology and origins, but the simultaneous presence of Indra and Shiva in the Kushan era artwork suggest that they were revered deities by the start of the Kushan Empire.|$|E
5|$|In January 1821, Iturbide began peace {{negotiations}} with Guerrero, suggesting they unite {{to establish an}} independent New Spain. The simple terms that Iturbide proposed became {{the basis of the}} Plan of Iguala: the independence of New Spain (now to be called the Mexican Empire) with Ferdinand VII or another Bourbon as emperor; the retention of the Catholic Church as the official state <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> protection of its existing privileges; and the equality of all New Spaniards, whether immigrants or native-born. The following month the other important guerrilla leader, Guadalupe Victoria, joined the alliance, and March 1 Iturbide was proclaimed head of a new Army of the Three Guarantees. The representative of the new Spanish government, Superior Political Chief Juan O'Donojú, who replaced the previous viceroys, arrived in Veracruz on July 1, 1821; but he found that royalists the entire country except for Veracruz, Mexico City and Acapulco. Since at the time that O'Donojú had left Spain, the Cortes was considering greatly expanding the autonomy of the overseas Spanish possessions, O'Donojú proposed to negotiate a treaty with Iturbide on the terms of the Plan of Iguala. The resulting Treaty of Córdoba, which was signed on August 24, kept all existing laws, including the 1812 Constitution, in force until a new constitution for Mexico could be written. O'Donojú became part of the provisional governing junta until his death on October 8. Both the Spanish Cortes and Ferdinand VII rejected the Treaty of Córdoba, and the final break with the mother country came on May 19, 1822, when the Mexican Congress conferred the throne on Itrubide.|$|E
