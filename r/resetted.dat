The results showed that after remaining in rosetted condition for about three months even the control non-chilled plants displayed rosette breaking tendency. Both chilling and GA, separately as well as in combination accelarated internode elongation and blooming. Thirty day chilling was found to be most effective.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to increase future abiotic stresses on ecosystems through extreme weather events leading to more extreme drought and rainfall incidences [Jentsch A, et al. (2007) Front Ecol Environ 5 (7) : 365 – 374]. These fluctuations in precipitation may affect soil biota, soil processes [Evans ST, Wallenstein MD (2012) Biogeochemistry 109 : 101 – 116], and the proportion of exotics in invaded plant communities [Jiménez MA, et al. (2011) Ecol Lett 14 : 1277 – 1235]. However, little is known about legacy effects in soil on the performance of exotics and natives in invaded plant communities. Here we report that drought and rainfall effects on soil processes and biota affect the performance of exotics and natives in plant communities. We performed two mesocosm experiments. In the first experiment, soil without plants was exposed to drought and/or rainfall, which affected soil N availability. Then the initial soil moisture conditions were restored, and a mixed community of co-occurring natives and exotics was planted and exposed to drought during growth. A single stress before or during growth decreased the biomass of natives, but did not affect exotics. A second drought stress during plant growth <b>resetted</b> the exotic advantage, whereas native biomass was not further reduced. In the second experiment, soil inoculation revealed that drought and/or rainfall influenced soil biotic legacies, which promoted exotics but suppressed natives. Our results demonstrate that extreme weather events can cause legacy effects in soil biota, promoting exotics and suppressing natives in invaded plant communities, depending on the type, frequency, and timing of extreme events. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{potentiality}} {{of growing}} dwarf cultivars of Oriental lilies as flowering pot plants was investigated. Two cultivars, L. auratum 'Little Gem'and L. x parkmanni 'Little Robin' were grown {{to assess their}} suitability and determine a predictable schedule of production. Initially it was established that these plants could be grown satisfactorily in containers and that after adequate vernalization adequate growth and flowering took place. In bulbs selected after natural senescence, vernalization {{can be achieved by}} planting and storing the bulbs outdoors to experience natural winter chilling and also artificially by storage at controlled cool temperatures. Planting prior to artificial cool storage was not advantageous. There is a minimum period of storage of 35 days and preferably 42 days for both cultivars, while temperatures may range from 1. 7 °C to 8 °C for L. auratum 'Little Gem and to 12 °C for L. x parkmanni 'Little Robin'. The periods from planting to emergence and emergence to macroscopically visible flower buds are inversely related to the length of time the bulbs are stored, irrespective of the cool temperature. Subsequent growth to anthesis {{is directly related to the}} temperature at which the plants are grown and independant of previous storage times and temperatures. The time required to achieve anthesis is consistent in any one temperature regime. Although the longer the time the bulbs experience cool temperatures, the sooner the plants achieve anthesis, the total time from commencement of storage to anthesis is similar for all storage periods up to 10 weeks. When bulbs are inadequately vernalized, growth and flowering is irregular; growth being <b>resetted</b> and anthesis delayed or occuring spasmodically.

40|$|In {{the area}} of Pobiti Kamani (Varna, {{northeast}} Bulgaria), massive carbonate cemented columns ("chimneys", up to 1. 5 m diameter and 8 m high) and horizontal interbeds (<= 1. 5 m thickness) occur in dispersed outcrops over an area of 70 km(2) within loose Lower Eocene sands. Field observations and petrographical and stable isotope geochemical characterisation of four studied locations reveal a relationship between these structures and processes of ancient hydrocarbon seepage. Column and interbed structures both consist of similar well-sorted silt- to sand-sized nummulitic host sediments, predominantly cemented by early diagenetic, low-magnesium calcite. Filamentous textures, about 10 pm in diameter and 80 - 650 pm long, are only locally detected within interparticle calcite cement of columns. Column samples from two sites reveal a similar, linear and inverse covariant trend of delta C- 13 -delta O- 18 values, which was interpreted as a mixing trend between two end member fluid/precipitation conditions, i. e. (1) a methane- and/or higher hydrocarbon-derived carbon member characterised by delta C- 13 values as low as - 43 %parts per thousand and marine controlled precipitation conditions with delta O- 18 of - 1 +/- 0. 5 parts per thousand V-PDB and (2) a member with less contribution of methane which was mixed most likely with less depleted carbon sources explaining delta C- 13 values ranging up to - 8 parts per thousand V-PDB. The corresponding, depleted delta O- 18 values, with many samples clustering around - 8 parts per thousand V-PDB, are interpreted in terms of precipitation at elevated temperatures. This suggests the venting system was not a true "cold' seep, sensu stricto. Furthermore, column cross-transects often document an internal pattern consisting of (concentric) zones with distinct isotopic signatures, which vary between the two end members. The mixing and internal pattern of column isotopic data, together with petrographical observations, are qualitatively interpreted as evidence of alternating precipitation conditions, controlled by varying seepage rates of a single fluid source at depth, during buildup of individual chimney pipes near the sediment surface. Based on several field observations, migration of the hydrocarbon-charged fluids in Lower Eocene times was possibly channelled along NE oriented faults. Isotopic signatures of calcite cemented horizontal interbeds, with depleted PO ratios as low as - 8. 88 parts per thousand V-PDB and variable delta C- 13 (- 1 parts per thousand to - 16 parts per thousand, mainly around - 5 parts per thousand to - 7 parts per thousand) suggest that ascending fluids contributed to their cementation or <b>resetted</b> the calcite cement isotopic signature, predominantly during periods of active seepage of warmer fluids. Only few petrographical (and preliminary lipid-biomarker) evidence has been found, pointing to the presence or possibly former activity of microbiota, involved in carbon cycling and calcite precipitation, typical of cold seep settings. This may result from diagenetic alteration of organic components. However, considering the processes of chimney formation, a cementation process, governed by the inorganic oxidation of hydrocarbons in which interstitial oxygen is rapidly consumed without bacterial mediation, is considered.
