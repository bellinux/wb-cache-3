40|$|A {{scientific}} hurdle {{in manufacturing}} solid films by drying colloidal layers is {{preventing them from}} fracturing. This paper examines how the drying rate of colloidal liquids influences the particle packing at the nanoscale in correlation with the crack patterns observed at the macroscale. Increasing the drying rate results in more ordered, denser solid structures, and the dried samples have more cracks. Yet, introducing a holding period (at a prescribed point) during the drying protocol results in a more disordered solid structure with significantly less cracks. To interpret these observations, this paper conjectures that a longer drying protocol favors the formation of aggregates. It is further argued that the number {{and size of the}} aggregates increase as the drying rate decreases. This results in the formation of a more disordered, porous film from the viewpoint of the particle packing, and a more <b>resistant</b> <b>film,</b> i. e. less cracks, from the macroscale viewpoint...|$|E

The SiO 2 nanoparticles were synthesized by base catalyzed hydrolyses and condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) mixed with an aqueous solvent. The surface modification of the TiO 2 and SiO 2 nanoparticles with 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTS) avoids the agglomeration of the nanoparticles and covalent bonds between the matrix and nanoparticles are formed during a photopolymerization step.

The {{objective was to}} examine step loading wear by use of surface analysis, wetting, and chemical bonding changes in the lubricant. The investigation consisted of steploading wear studies by a pin or disk tribometer, the effects on wear related to wetting by contact angle and surface tension measurements of various liquid systems, the chemical bonding changes between lubricant and TCP chromatographic analysis, and by determining the reaction between the TCP and metal surfaces through wear scar analysis by Auger emission spectroscopy (AES). The steploading curve for the base fluid alone shows rapid increase of wear rate with load. The steploading curve for the base fluid in presence of 4. 25 percent by volume TCP under dry air purge has shown a great reduction of wear rate with all loads studied.

From among these various defects in coated thin films, corrosion resistance of TiN film coated specimens was usually governed by pinhole defect. Therefore, for applying TiN film in corrosion surroundings, {{it is necessary}} to evaluate the existing state of defects in the film. The Critical Passivation Current Density (CPCD) method had some problems though this method could quantitatively estimate defects as a pinhole defect ratio R(%) through employing the values of the critical passivation current density o f TiN thin film coated specimen i,,.,(Coating/Substrate) and that of non-coated substrate specimen i,,,(Substrate). The most serious problem is the overestimation in defect ratio evaluation in the cases when large corrosion pits were generated and some parts of TiN films were exfoliated due t o its low adhesion strength. The adhesion characteristic of TiN films, which was coated by plasma CVD, was investigated by the scratch test. Then, through investigating the relationship between temperature condition of TiN film formation and critical load of LC obtained by scratch test, the adhesive strength between TiN film and substrate was evaluated. Also, through evaluating the substrate materials dependency upon adhesive strength, the applicable range o f the CPCD test was made clear for the defect ratio evaluation o f TiN films with various film thickness and adhesion strength.
