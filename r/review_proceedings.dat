5|$|According to the Government Proceedings Act, civil {{proceedings}} against the Government must be commenced against an appropriate authorized Government department. If {{there is no}} appropriate authorized Government department, or the person wishing to commence proceedings has reasonable doubt as to which department (if any) is appropriate, proceedings should be commenced against the Attorney-General. This rule applies to judicial <b>review</b> <b>proceedings</b> in which prerogative orders or declarations are sought.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there is a {{possibility}} that he or she may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal plaintiff in the judicial <b>review</b> <b>proceedings,</b> but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing on the part of the individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E

5|$|The {{principle}} that the correct test in judicial <b>review</b> <b>proceedings</b> is an objective one continues to apply in cases not involving the Internal Security Act. In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs (1992), the Court of Appeal remarked that, following Chng Suan Tze, {{the power of the}} Minister for Home Affairs under section 30(a) of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act to order the preventive detention of a person was dependent on the Minister's objective, and not subjective, satisfaction that the person was associated with criminal activities.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Davis GAA club instituted {{judicial}} <b>review</b> <b>proceedings</b> in the High Court in May 2006. Their main {{argument was}} that {{the decision of the}} council on 13 February 2006 to revert to the original plans for the stadium, which did not include a senior GAA pitch, was unlawful. Their submission on the technical point was accompanied by cultural arguments that 'the youth of Tallaght will be restricted to a diet of Association football' and that a soccer-only ground would place the 'applicant at a severe disadvantage in attracting the youth of Tallaght to the club, the sport and the GAA culture. The stadium, however, with the original design, could accommodate junior GAA games as the pitch used at this level fits within the stadium's dimensions.

5|$|Section 8B(2) {{contained}} an ouster clause that restricted {{the scope of}} judicial review to any question relating to compliance with any procedural requirements of the ISA governing acts or decisions by the President or the Home Affairs Minister. The amendments to the ISA were made retrospective by section 8D, which meant that they applied to judicial <b>review</b> <b>proceedings</b> that had been started before the amendment Act came into force. In addition, the Constitution was amended through the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 to prevent the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 from being challenged as unconstitutional. Article 149(3) was inserted into the Constitution, with the effect that {{if the issue of}} whether any executive decision made pursuant to the ISA came before a court (whether before or after this constitutional amendment came into force on 27 January 1989), the court had to decide this issue according to the new provisions introduced by the 1989 ISA amendments. Article 149(1) was amended to add Articles 11 and 12 to the list of fundamental liberties that the ISA cannot be challenged against, and to extend its immunizing effect to the 1989 ISA amendments.|$|E

Although section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act states that courts cannot grant an injunction in civil proceedings against the Government, he rejected the State Counsel's argument that based on this provision the Court did not have power to do so.

25|$|Yaw Shin Leong, {{a member}} of the Workers' Party of Singapore, was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Hougang Single Member Constituency (SMC) at the 2011 general election. He was {{expelled}} from the party on 14 February 2012 for refusing to explain to the party leadership certain allegations of marital infidelity that had come to light. As a result, pursuant to Article 46(2)(b) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, he lost his parliamentary seat which became vacant, leaving the residents of Hougang SMC unrepresented. This spurred the applicant, Madam Vellama d/o (daughter of) Marie Muthu, a voter resident in Hougang SMC, to commence judicial <b>review</b> <b>proceedings</b> in the High Court on 2 March 2012 to compel the Government to call a by-election. She sought a declaration as to the proper construction of Article 49(1) of the Constitution and a mandatory order requiring the Prime Minister to advise the President to issue a writ of election for Hougang SMC within three months from the date of the vacancy, or such other reasonable period as the Court deemed fit.|$|E

500|$|Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988) was a {{landmark}} Court of Appeal case in administrative law, specifically {{with regards to}} reviewing the grounds of detention without trial under the Internal Security Act. One of the main issues before the court was whether the test for judicial review was objective or subjective; in other words, whether judges could examine whether the executive's decision to detain a person was in fact based on national security considerations, as well as whether the executive's considerations in determining the detention fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes specified in section 8(1) of the Act. The court, in an obiter ruling, advocated the objective standard, stating: [...] "All power has legal limits {{and the rule of law}} demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power." [...] Although the case was legislatively overruled in respect of internal security matters by amendments to the Constitution of Singapore and the Internal Security Act, the principle still applies in judicial <b>review</b> <b>proceedings</b> not involving the Act.|$|E

At the same time, the court was asked to rule on whether an Order in Council could be questioned in judicial <b>review</b> <b>proceedings.</b> It decided that, under Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service, the decisive element was not the origin of the power (in this case, the Royal Prerogative) but the nature of the power.
