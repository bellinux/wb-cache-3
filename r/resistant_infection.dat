5000|$|Treatment of AIT {{involves}} antibiotic treatment. Based on {{the offending}} organism found on microscopic {{examination of the}} stained fine needle aspirate, the appropriate antibiotic treatment is determined. In {{the case of a}} severe infection, systemic antibiotics are necessary. [...] Empirical broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment provides preliminary coverage for a variety of bacteria, including S. aureus and S. pyogenes. [...] Antimicrobial options include penicillinase-resistant penicillins (ex: cloxacillin, dicloxacillin) or a combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. [...] However, in patients with a penicillin allergy, clindamycin or a macrolide can be prescribed. [...] The majority of anaerobic organisms involved with AIT are susceptible to penicillin. Certain Gram-negative bacilli (ex: Prevotella, Fusobacteria, and Porphyromonas) are exhibiting an increased resistance based on the production of beta-lactamase. [...] Patients who have undergone recent penicillin therapy have demonstrated an increase in beta-lactamase-producing (anaerobic and aerobic) bacteria. Clindamycin, or a combination of metronidazole and a macrolide, or a penicillin combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor is recommended in these cases. [...] Fungal thyroiditis can be treated with amphotericin B and fluconazole. [...] Early treatment of AIT prevents further complications. However, if antibiotic treatment does not manage the infection, surgical drainage is required. Symptoms or indications requiring drainage include continued fever, high white blood cell count, and continuing signs of localized inflammation. [...] The draining procedure is also based on clinical examination or ultrasound/CT scan results that indicate an abscess or gas formation. [...] Another treatment of AIT involves surgically removing the fistula. This treatment is often the option recommended for children. [...] However, in cases of an antibiotic <b>resistant</b> <b>infection</b> or necrotic tissue, a lobectomy is recommended. [...] If diagnosis and/or treatment is delayed, the disease could prove fatal.|$|E

Since there are thousands of codes used to define patient condition and treatment procedures, in order to use predictive modeling, these codes must be reduced to a manageable number. SAS Text Miner can be used for this purpose.

40|$|The {{overuse of}} {{antibiotics}} {{has created a}} potential public health menace—the growth of microbial <b>infections</b> <b>resistant</b> to them.

40|$|The public, as {{the users}} of antibiotics, can {{contribute}} to the control of bacterial resistance. National and international campaigns have recommended public education to promote the judicious and safe use of antibiotics, and in particular, reducing antibiotic use and misuse in upper respiratory tract infections. Campaigns, however, have not been informed by detailed understanding of public attitudes to the problem. Although previous studies have explored lay perceptions of common infections and antibiotics, public attitudes to bacterial resistance, beliefs about antibiotic use in relation to bacterial resistance and the attitudes towards respiratory tract infection influencing antibiotic use are under researched. This thesis addresses this gap using a grounded theory approach. Semi-structured interviews with members of community groups were conducted across South East Wales. By analysing patterns and connections between various beliefs this thesis shows that historical antecedents and beliefs about dirt and germs act as prototypes for current beliefs about <b>resistant</b> <b>infection.</b> Most respondents did not feel that they have a personal role in either the cause or control of bacterial resistance. Lay beliefs about aetiology resided in both traditional and biomedical models. There was a reliance on medicines, and specifically antibiotic attachment, which contributed to self-medication and expectations for antibiotics during upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Promoting public engagement in the control of bacterial resistance requires a number of approaches to behavioural change. In relation to antibiotic use efforts to promote adherence to antibiotic regimes need to address beliefs about antibiotics, forgetfulness and practical barriers to adherence but also to reduce public expectations for antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections by enhancing understanding about the microbial causes of URTI. Efforts to reduce antibiotic use, however, need also to address the wider meaning and the reliance on antibiotics.

Studies have shown that the enzyme Methylthioadenosine / S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (MTN), which is present in many bacterial species, is a potential target for new antibiotics. Our goal is to target and halt adenine and methionine salvage in pathogenic bacteria by developing specific non-nucleoside MTN inhibitors. An MTN inhibitor “ 15 A” was previously identified via in silico screening. To develop a structure-activity relationship (SAR) based on 15 A, the inhibitory activity of a series of 15 A analogs were examined using a spectrophotometric assay.
