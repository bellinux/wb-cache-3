In 1971 he survived a party inquiry after a complaint against him by Norman Scott, a <b>riding</b> <b>instructor</b> and would-be model.

40|$|Equestrian {{sport is}} one of the largest sports among young girls in Sweden. A {{majority}} of these girls get their riding education at riding schools that provide horses and instructors. Previous research has pointed out that the Swedish riding school is characterised by a traditional stable culture that originated in army practices. Presently Swedish children and youth sport at large are undergoing a change driven by increased commercialisation and individualisation. The aim of this article is therefore to explore and analyse how Swedish <b>riding</b> <b>instructors</b> perceive and experience their professional role in regards to these changes. Interviews with 10 <b>riding</b> <b>instructors</b> have been analysed using a constructivist approach of Grounded theory, as well as institutional theory and institutional economic theory. It was discovered that the <b>riding</b> <b>instructors,</b> due to an economic recession, feel that the institutional arrangements of the riding schools have become governed by the economy. The <b>riding</b> <b>instructors</b> thus feel impelled to change and adapt to new teaching styles – from instruction characterised by giving orders to teaching characterised by dialogue. This study illustrates how economic challenges require continuous development of the riding instructors’ pedagogical ability, and have made them more aware of their profession, its historical heritage and norms...|$|R

25|$|An Italian <b>riding</b> <b>instructor,</b> Captain Federico Caprilli, heavily {{influenced}} {{the world of}} jumping with his ideas promoting a forward position with shorter stirrups. This style placed the rider in a position that did {{not interfere with the}} balance of the horse while negotiating obstacles. This style, now known as the forward seat, is commonly used today. The deep, Dressage-style seat, while useful for riding on the flat and in conditions where control of the horse is of greater importance than freedom of movement, is less suitable for jumping.|$|E
25|$|Patsy Burt's {{introduction}} to motor sport was through her father, Eric Burt, who was himself an accomplished racing driver. After initially disliking {{visits to the}} Brooklands circuit to watch her father and others competing on the high speed Surrey banking, following World War II she trained as a <b>riding</b> <b>instructor.</b> However, she remained in contact with motor racing through her father's involvement with the Junior Car Club, and occasionally spectated at the Goodwood Circuit, one of Britain's few post-war motor racing venues.

He moved back to England, and eventually found {{a job at a}} riding school in Wolverhampton, where he stayed for several months before his erratic behaviour proved too much, and he was asked to leave. After a period of aimlessness in London, Josiffe saw an advertisement for a groom's post in Porrentruy in Switzerland. Thorpe used his influence to secure him the job. Josiffe left for Switzerland in December 1964, but returned to England almost immediately with complaints that conditions were impossible. In his hurry to depart he left his suitcase behind, which contained letters and other documents that, he believed, supported his claims to a sexual relationship with Thorpe.|$|E

2500|$|Fred Quilley (Felix Bowness) <b>Riding</b> <b>Instructor</b> – Fred was {{an illegitimate}} child {{and grew up}} in an orphanage until he was adopted at the age of {{fourteen}} and went to live in Brighton. He began working at the Brighton Racecourse and eventually qualified as a jockey. He became involved with the daughter of the local undertaker but they split up when he refused to join the family business. During World War II he was conscripted into the RAF, where he trained as an instrument mechanic, but spent the entire war stationed at Catterick. After being demobilised in 1945, he returned to Brighton Racecourse and married the owner of a wet-fish shop, but the relationship was short-lived and they soon separated. He then fell into the employ of a small-time gangster known as [...] "Big Mac", who began paying him to fix the races, either by pulling his horse or drugging it prior to the race. However, on one occasion the race officials caught him pulling the favourite and gave him an official warning. The following week he took £300 from Big Mac to lose a race but accidentally won, causing Big Mac to lose £5,000 in bets. Shortly afterwards Fred was caught in a horsebox with a syringe and his jockey's licence was revoked. He was forced to leave Brighton for fear of further reprisals from the underworld and began drifting, eventually joining the staff at Maplins in 1951 as the <b>riding</b> <b>instructor.</b> Fred shared a chalet with Mr Partridge, even though they both hated each other – Fred hated Partridge smelling of alcohol and Partridge hated Fred smelling of horses. When Partridge left and faked his death, Fred shared a chalet with Sammy, although they had a better relationship. After the end of the 1960 season, Fred went to work in an old horses' home.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the onset}} of the First World War in September 1914, Kirchner volunteered for {{military}} service. In July 1915 he was sent to Halle an der Saale to train as a driver in the reserve unit of the 75th Mansfeld Field Artillery Regiment. Kirchner's <b>riding</b> <b>instructor,</b> Professor Hans Fehr, arranged for Kirchner to be discharged after a mental breakdown. [...] Kirchner then returned to Berlin and continued to work, producing many paintings including Self-Portrait as a Soldier (1915); in December 1915 he was admitted to Dr. Kohnstamm’s sanatorium in Königstein in Taunus, where he was diagnosed with a strong dependency on Veronal, and alcoholism. In a letter to Dr. Karl Hagemann, a friend and patron, Kirchner writes: [...] "After lengthy struggles I now find myself here for a time to put my mind into some kind of order. It is a terribly difficult thing, of course, to be among strangers so much of the day. But perhaps I’ll be able to see and create something new. For the time being, I would like more peace and absolute seclusion. Of course, I long more and more for my work and my studio. Theories may be all very well for keeping a spiritual balance, but they are grey and shadowy compared with work and life". Throughout 1916, Kirchner periodically returned to Berlin for a few weeks at a time to continue his work at his studio; he also produced a series of oil paintings, and many drawings, during his stays in Königstein. After an exhibition of his work in at the gallery of Ludwig Schames, in Frankfurt am Main, in October 1916, Kirchner sold many works and began to do well financially. In December, he suffered from a nervous breakdown and was admitted to Dr. Edel’s sanatorium in Berlin Charlottenburg.|$|E

5000|$|A tapadero, {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "hooded stirrup," [...] is leather cover over the front of a stirrup on a saddle that closes each stirrup from the front. A tapadero prevents the rider's boot from slipping through and also prevents brush encountered while working cattle on the open range from poking through the stirrup, injuring or impeding the horse or rider. Some designs can also provide protection in cold weather. They are also frequently used with young riders, as many parents and <b>riding</b> <b>instructors</b> feel they are a safety precaution. Most commonly seen today on a western saddle, particularly certain types of children's saddles and parade horse saddles, the tapadero is not common in modern times and is not allowed in most show competition other than Parade Horse competition and children's leadline.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the deep, secure-feeling seat, {{the design}} is also used by some people when {{starting}} young, unpredictable horses, and is quite popular for trail riding, endurance riding, and casual hacking. Many top-level endurance riders find this design superior to an [...] "endurance" [...] style saddle for distance competition because {{it allows them to}} get off the horse's back and move quickly over rough or mountainous terrain, yet provides greater security to the rider. On the other hand, this compromise design also means that an advanced rider may find the saddle limits his or her ability to obtain a correct position at higher levels of competition, either in show jumping or dressage. For this reason, some English <b>riding</b> <b>instructors</b> and coaches do not particularly encourage their riders to use these saddles.|$|R
