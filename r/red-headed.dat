5|$|The <b>red-headed</b> myzomela {{closely resembles}} the scarlet myzomela, {{though there is}} only a small overlap in their {{respective}} ranges, in eastern Cape York Peninsula. The latter species lives in woodlands rather than mangroves. The dusky myzomela resembles the female <b>red-headed</b> myzomela, but is larger and darker brown, and lacks the red markings around the bill. The Sumba myzomela is similar but slightly smaller than the <b>red-headed</b> myzomela and has darker upper parts and a broad black pectoral band.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prominent}} examples of bad girl films, <b>Red-Headed</b> Woman and Baby Face, featured Harlow and Stanwyck. In <b>Red-Headed</b> Woman Harlow plays a secretary determined to sleep her way into a more luxurious lifestyle, and in Baby Face Stanwyck is an abused runaway determined to use sex to advance herself financially.|$|E

5|$|The <b>red-headed</b> myzomela is arboreal, feeding at {{flowers and}} among the outer foliage in the crowns of {{mangroves}} and other flowering trees. Very active when feeding, it darts from flower to flower, probing for nectar with its long curved bill. It gleans insects from foliage and twigs, as well as sallying for flying insects. Typical invertebrates eaten include spiders and insects such as beetles, bugs, wasps and caterpillars. The <b>red-headed</b> myzomela predominately feeds on mangrove species, and in north western Australia is the major pollinator of the rib-fruited mangrove (Bruguiera exaristata), however it also feeds in paperbarks and other coastal forests and has been recorded feeding in cultivated bottlebrush and Grevillea in Darwin gardens, silver-leaf grevillea (Grevillea refracta) and green birdflower (Crotalaria cunninghamii) in northwest Western Australia. The <b>red-headed</b> myzomela may travel some distance from roosting areas to feed on plants in flower.|$|E
5|$|The <b>red-headed</b> myzomela is {{occasionally}} {{found in}} swampy woodlands, casuarina woodlands and open forest, particularly those with Pandanus and paperbarks, {{as well as}} on coconut farms.|$|E
5|$|The <b>red-headed</b> myzomela or <b>red-headed</b> honeyeater (Myzomela erythrocephala) is a {{passerine}} bird of the honeyeater family, Meliphagidae, {{found in}} Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. It {{was described by}} John Gould in 1840. Two subspecies are recognised, with the nominate race M. e. erythrocephala distributed around the tropical coastline of Australia, and M. e. infuscata in New Guinea. Though widely distributed, it is not abundant within this range. While the IUCN lists the Australian population of M. e. infuscata as being near threatened, as a whole the widespread range means that its conservation is of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Flo {{meets the}} <b>red-headed</b> Broadway star Billie Burke and soon marries her. When {{she hears the}} news, a heartbroken Anna {{telephones}} Flo and pretends to be glad for him. Flo and Billie eventually have a daughter named Patricia.|$|E
5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch and {{the royal}} parrotfinch of {{northern}} Vanuatu are now again usually {{considered to be}} distinct species, but they were formerly frequently treated as subspecies of the Samoan <b>red-headed</b> parrotfinch, E. cyaneovirens.|$|E
5|$|The <b>red-headed</b> myzomela has a {{range of}} contact calls and songs that are {{primarily}} metallic or scratchy. Its song is an abrupt tchwip-tchwip-tchwip-tchwip with a slightly softer swip-swip-swip-swip contact call and a scolding charrk-charrk.|$|E
5|$|The <b>red-headed</b> myzomela is {{a member}} of the genus Myzomela which {{includes}} two other Australian species, the scarlet myzomela of eastern Australia, and the dusky myzomela of northern Australia. It belongs to the honeyeater family Meliphagidae. A 2004 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of honeyeaters found it to be the next closest relative to a smaller group consisting of the scarlet and cardinal myzomelas, although only five of the thirty members of the genus Myzomela were analysed. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA suggests that the ancestor of the <b>red-headed</b> myzomela diverged from that of the black-breasted myzomela around 4 million years ago, however the relationships of many species within the genus is uncertain. Molecular analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea. Because the <b>red-headed</b> myzomela occurs on many offshore islands and appears to be an effective water-crosser, it has been hypothesised that north-western Australia was the primary centre of origin for the two subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>red-headed</b> myzomela {{is widely}} distributed, {{it is not}} {{abundant}} within its range. The largest recorded population was 5.5 birds per hectare or 2.2 per acre at Palmerston in the Northern Territory. The peak abundance of the species in the mangroves around Darwin Harbour during the mid-dry and early wet season coincided with the production of young and the flowering of the yellow mangrove (Ceriops australis).|$|E
5|$|Death (McKinney) is a grim reaper {{assigned}} to collects souls from Shuckton. He has personal vendetta against Ricky â€“ {{who was supposed}} to be aborted before he was born, but who survived the procedure because Death was late to collect his soul. When off duty, he hangs out at the tavern, drinking owl's blood and flirting with voluptuous <b>red-headed</b> women.|$|E
5|$|Fiji {{has another}} Erythrura species, the rare and {{endangered}} pink-billed parrotfinch. This {{is a larger}} bird with a green head, blue crown and black face, and a very large pink bill. The Fiji parrotfinch resembles the closely related royal and <b>red-headed</b> parrotfinches, and the rare blue-headed variant is very like the blue-faced parrotfinch, but these three species do not occur in Fiji.|$|E
5|$|Maureen O'Hara (born Maureen FitzSimons; 17 August 192024 October 2015) was an Irish-born American {{actress and}} singer. The famously <b>red-headed</b> O'Hara {{was known for}} her beauty and playing {{fiercely}} passionate but sensible heroines, often in westerns and adventure films. She worked on numerous occasions with director John Ford and longtime friend John Wayne, {{and was one of}} the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|The <b>red-headed</b> myzomela {{actively}} defends food trees, {{engaging in}} aggressive bill-wiping both {{in response to}} a threat and after chasing intruders from a tree. It is very antagonistic even towards its own species; the males fight by grappling in mid-air and falling close to the ground before disengaging. It constantly chases brown honeyeaters through the canopy, though it has not been observed in grappling fights with other species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>red-headed</b> myzomela mostly inhabits {{mangroves}} in monsoonal coastal areas, especially thickets of spotted mangrove (Rhizophora stylosa), smallflower bruguiera (Bruguiera parviflora) and grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) bordering islands or in river deltas, but {{it often}} also occurs in paperbark thickets fringing the mangroves {{such as those}} of cajeput (Melaleuca leucadendra). It is a mangrove specialist, an adaptation that probably occurred as northern Australia became more arid and the bird populations became dependent on mangroves as other types of forest disappeared. The mangroves provide nectar and insects as well as shelter and nesting sites, and they supply the majority of the species' needs for most of the year. In Australia, mangrove vegetation forms a narrow discontinuous strip along thousands of kilometres of coastline, accommodating birds specialized for the habitat. Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia has no mangroves and no fringing Melaleuca forests, reducing its potential for successful colonization by nectarivores, and it marks the southern limit of the <b>red-headed</b> myzomela in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} {{numerous}} common names, including the grey-necked rockfowl, grey-necked picathartes, bare-headed rockfowl, <b>red-headed</b> rockfowl, blue-headed picathartes, and grey-necked bald crow. Rockfowl is {{a reference to}} the species' habit of building mud nests on rock surfaces and caves. Picathartes refers to the species' scientific name. Bald crow is a reference to its featherless head and somewhat crow-like appearance, especially in its beak.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{plentiful}} {{in the waters}} surrounding the island, where one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), Giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or African red snappers (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The <b>red-headed</b> agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island.|$|E
5|$|While {{the social}} {{organisation}} of the <b>red-headed</b> myzomela is relatively unknown, {{it is reported}} as being usually solitary or found in pairs, though it {{has been described as}} forming loose associations with brown honeyeaters, and other mangrove-feeding birds such as the northern fantail and yellow white-eye. It is an inquisitive bird and readily responds to pishing, coming close to the caller to investigate the source of the sound and to warn off the intruder. It calls throughout the day when feeding, and males sing from exposed branches in the upper canopy of the food trees.|$|E
5|$|At , it {{is a small}} honeyeater with a short {{tail and}} {{relatively}} long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy, darting from flower to flower and gleaning insects off foliage. It calls constantly as it feeds. While little has been documented on the <b>red-headed</b> myzomela's breeding behaviour, it is recorded as building a small cup-shaped nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval, white eggs with small red blotches.|$|E
5|$|Many {{hypothetical}} extinct macaws {{were based}} only on contemporaneous accounts, but these species are considered dubious today. Several of them were named in the early 20th century by Rothschild, who {{had a tendency to}} name species based on little tangible evidence. Among others, the <b>red-headed</b> macaw (Ara erythrocephala) and the Jamaican red macaw (Ara gossei) were named for accounts of macaws on Jamaica, and the Dominican green-and-yellow macaw (Ara atwoodi) was supposedly from Dominica island. The violet macaw (Anodorhynchus purpurascens), which was named for accounts of blue parrots supposedly from Guadeloupe, is now thought to have been based on references to the Guadeloupe amazon (Amazona violacea).|$|E
5|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies of the <b>red-headed</b> myzomela {{is distributed}} across the tropical coastlines of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. It inhabits coastal {{areas of the}} Kimberley and various offshore islands in Western Australia, and is similarly distributed in the Northern Territory, including Melville Island and the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands. It is widespread around {{the coast of the}} Gulf of Carpentaria and the Cape York Peninsula. M. e. infuscata occurs at scattered sites in West Papua and in south Papua New Guinea, from the Mimika Regency in the west to the Fly River in the east, and the Aru Islands. Some birds of Cape York have features intermediate between the two subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch (Erythrura pealii) is {{a species}} of estrildid finch endemic to Fiji that was {{formerly}} {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the <b>red-headed</b> parrotfinch. This parrotfinch is a small, mainly green bird with a red head and tail and a stubby dark grey bill. It is found in both forested and open habitats, and has adapted well to man-made environments such as grasslands, pasture and gardens. Pairs have a courtship display in which they fly above the trees in an undulating flight, calling constantly. Breeding birds build a domed grass nest with a side entrance, and lay a clutch normally of four white eggs. Newly hatched chicks are naked and pink, with blue balls at the upper and lower corners of the gape, and black markings inside the mouth; older fledglings resemble the adults, but lack the red head colouring. The Fiji parrotfinch eats seeds, especially of grasses, and also readily feeds on insects and nectar. It forms small flocks of up to six birds after the breeding season.|$|E
25|$|The <b>red-headed</b> trogon (Harpactes erythrocephalus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Trogonidae.|$|E
25|$|Darbey's lock or Darkey's lock {{was named}} after Hughey Darkey, who had four or five <b>red-headed</b> girls.|$|E
25|$|<b>Red-headed</b> kraits {{inhabit the}} rain forests in mountainous and hilly regions. They are hardly ever {{to be found in}} {{proximity}} to human habitations.|$|E
25|$|In most regions, the <b>red-headed</b> trogon is {{sedentary}} although {{researchers have}} observed altitudinal movements in Southern Laos, {{as well as}} in the Sangthong district, Northern Laos.|$|E
25|$|<b>Red-headed</b> trogons {{are most}} {{active in the}} early hours of the morning and at night, when they fly on the edges of forest clearings in pursuit of flying moths.|$|E
25|$|The <b>red-headed</b> krait {{occurs in}} Thailand, Myanmar (Burma), Cambodia, Vietnam, western Malaysia, Pulau Tioman, and Indonesia (Bangka, Sumatra, Java, Billiton, Borneo). The {{subspecies}} B. f. baluensis {{is found in}} Malaysia (East Malaysia, Sabah).|$|E
25|$|<b>Red-headed</b> trogons can {{most often}} be found {{perched on a}} shaded branch waiting for prey, alone or in pairs. Flight between trees is often {{sluggish}} and very low, only a few meters above the ground.|$|E

25|$|Virtual Murder was {{an unusual}} investigative drama series shown on BBC {{television}} in 1992. It starred Nicholas Clay as Dr John Cornelius, a psychology lecturer at a provincial university, and Kim Thomson as his vivacious, <b>red-headed</b> partner, Samantha Valentine.|$|E
25|$|In Fanboy & Chum Chum, the two child wizard characters, the British <b>red-headed</b> boy {{is called}} Kyle Bloodworth-Thomason, {{who is a}} parody of Ronald Weasley and his German white-haired rival, Sigmund the Sorcerer is a parody of Draco Malfoy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Red-headed</b> trogons feed {{primarily}} on insects and their larvae {{found in the}} foliage, on tree branches or in mid air. They also eat leaves and fruits. Some food items include green orthopterans, stick-insects, cicadas, millipedes, flies, beetles, centipedes, woodlice and moths.|$|E
25|$|<b>Red-headed</b> trogons lay round, cream coloured, glossy eggs. Each egg {{measures}} approximately 26.5-27.5mm x 23.5-24.0mm. The mean clutch size is 2.6 eggs (between 2 and 4), with an {{incubation period}} of 18 days and a nestling period of 13.4 days, {{according to a}} single study in Thailand.|$|E
25|$|<b>Red-headed</b> trogons usually nest {{in natural}} tree cavities, 1.5 to 5m above the ground. The {{entrance}} hole is generally wide. Indeed, the pair will enlarge narrow entrances, and occasionally, will excavate the entire nesting cavity. Birds {{have been seen}} using old nesting holes of woodpeckers and barbets.|$|E
