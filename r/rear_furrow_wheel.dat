Approximately 40 {{percent of the}} irrigated acres in Nebraskaare furrow-irrigated. Higher pumping costs, water restrictions and water shortages are all factors encouraging efficiency-improving irrigation practices. Generally, reduced application efficiency with furrow irrigation occurs because of runoff or deep percolation. Although hard to eliminate, runoff can be controlled by tailwater reuse systems, changing furrow stream size, or changing irrigation set time. Deep percolation {{is the loss of}} water below the root zone. The amount of deep percolation caused by irrigation is difficult to estimate unless irrigation application is measured or the soil water content is monitored. Deep percolation reduces irrigation efficiency and increases pumping costs. In addition...|$|R

The seeder is suitable for the small farmers who have practice of direct seeding of onion under dry land cultivation. The seeder consists of a frame, a PVC drum, furrow openers, <b>furrow</b> closer, <b>wheels</b> and handle. In 2009 - 2010, the seeder was fabricated in FMP Engineering divisional workshop and tested in experimental plot, BARI, Gazipur. Seed rate of the seeder was 4 kg ha- 1 and field capacity was 0. 08 ha hr- 1. Weight and price of the seeder were 5. 5 kg and Tk 2500 per unit, respectively. In 2010 - 2011, a drug chain was added in the seeder and field performance evaluation of the seeder was repeated comparing with manual line sowing and traditional broadcasting methods in experimental plot of BARI, Gazipur. There was no significant variation between average yield of onion by using the seeder (13. 26 ton ha- 1) and in that of manual line sowing (12. 90 ton ha- 1) but there was significantly higher yield of onion by using the seeder than that in traditional (10. 25 ton ha- 1).

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is force effect {{analysis}} of ploughing rigs. MSC Adams software was used for mathematical-physical model drafting and subsequent evaluation of measured data from tensometrical load sensing. Designed model was utilized for force reactions calculations under the driving wheels of a tractor using analysis of spatial system of forces of tractors three point hitch. Field measurement data and data from MSC Adams software were tabular and graphically processed. Dependencies between plough and tractor connection setting and output performance of ploughing rigs were clarified. Results from experimental measurement with fully-mounted plough point out on the utilization of longitudinal and lateral position of ploughs CG for reducing of difference in load between <b>furrow</b> and land <b>wheel</b> with properly adjusted connection between plough and tractor. A result from experimental measurement with semi-mounted plough confirms the fact of significant difference in vertical load between rear axle wheels. This negative phenomenon could be eliminated with usage of traction cylinder localized in construction of semi-mounted ploughs over the horizontal joint. Correct adjustment of tractors three point hitch in case of fully-mounted ploughs and utilization of traction cylinder in case of semi-mounted ploughs have got positive influence on fuel consumption and field performance of ploughing rigs...|$|R

40|$|A weed flora rapidly {{built up}} with the {{cultivation}} of annual crops on two experimental farms in the Zanderij area of Suriname, {{despite the fact that}} the farms were newly established in forested areas. Studies indicated that without adequate weed control, significant yield losses occurred in groundnuts, sorghum and soybeans due to competition with weeds. Plant density of the crops was not affected, but competition with weeds reduced ground-cover and leaf area index. Competition affected growth rates, leading to lower yields. The nature of the competitive effects is discussed and data are presented on the spatial distribution of weed growth in the crops. To prevent yield reduction in groundnuts and soybeans, competition during the period of pod initiation should be avoided. In sorghum, competition must be prevented during the period of floret establishment. In groundnuts, a period of 15 weed-free days after planting prevented yield loss and the presence of too much weed at harvest. Yield losses in sorghum were prevented with about 20 weed-free days after planting. A period up to around 30 days was needed to attain negligible weed growth at harvest. It was necessary to weed soybeans up to around 30 days after planting to avoid yield loss and too much weed growth at maturity. The response of weeds to fertilizer application varied, depending on the weed vegetation and the nutrient applied. Both stimulation of growth and increase in weed density were observed.

It is noticed that the loss of water in the discharge of up to 40 % of the irrigation norms, especially characteristic for fields with steep slopes. Blow-off water washes away the fertile soil from fertilizers applied to improve soil fertility and crop yields. It is shown that as a result of irrigation erosion are reduced not only agricultural yields, but also quality of products.

Wilczek] differ {{in their ability to}} repair soil structure. The study was conducted on a Typic Haplustert, Queensland, Australia, locally termed a Black Earth and considered a prime cropping soil. Large (0. 5 -m depth by 0. 3 -m diam.) soil cores, collected from compacted <b>wheel</b> <b>furrows</b> in an irrigated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) field, were subjected to three, six, or nine wet-dry cycles that simulated local flood irrigation practices. After each cycle, soil profiles were sampled for clod bulk density, image analysis of soil structure, and evapotranspiration. Generally, all crops improved soil structure over the initial field condition but lablab and mung bean gave improvements to greater depths and more rapidly than wheat and sorghum. Mung bean and lablab caused up to a threefold increase in clod porosity in the 0. 1 - to 0. 4 -m soil layer after only three wet-dry cycles, whereas sorghum required nine wet-dry cycles to increase clod porosity in only the 0. 2 - to 0. 3 -m layer, and wheat gave no improvement even after nine wet-dry cycles. Image analysis of soil structure showed that lablab and mung bean rapidly (by three wet-dry cycles) produced smaller peds with more interconnected pore space than wheat and sorghum. By nine wet-dry cycles, sorghum achieved deep cracking of the soil but the material between the cracks remained large and dense. Evapotranspiration was double under lablab and mung bean compared with wheat and sorghum. Our results indicate greater cycles of wetting and drying under lablab and mung bean than wheat and sorghum that have led to rapid repair of soil compaction...|$|R
40|$|Bankless Channel Irrigation Systems (BCISs) are {{a surface}} {{irrigation}} system composed of adjacent, terraced bays with an interconnecting channel constructed {{such that the}} rim of the channel is level with the floor of each adjoining bay. The mode of irrigation is similar to Drain Back Level Basins (DBLBs) where the accumulated surface storage of each upstream bay is used to augment flow to a downstream bay. The systems of this study have been adapted from rice-based layouts to incorporate furrows for row-cropping. It is this style of BCIS that has generated considerable interest in Australia, particularly in the south east, where the system is used to grow a variety of crops and offers considerable labour and machine efficiency savings. Two defining features of BCISs are a positive field slope which rises from the bankless channel, and the hydraulic interaction between adjoining bays during the recession phase of the upstream bay and the advance phase in the downstream bay. These two features make evaluation challenging and mean no available hydraulic simulation model can simulate irrigation in these systems across an entire field. To improve the irrigation performance of BCISs a method of evaluating current performance was required. Consequently, the objectives of this research were to firstly identify appropriate evaluation methods for evaluating BCISs, then use these methods to evaluate the performance of current systems. This understanding could then be used to identify appropriate hydraulic models for the purpose of identifying parameters which influence irrigation performance in BCISs. In developing appropriate irrigation evaluation techniques for BCISs, a variety of evaluation methods were employed on a commercially operated BCIS in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) of south eastern Australia. Field measurements were taken during a number of irrigations in the 2007 / 08 irrigation season from a central furrow in each bay of the three bay system. It was assumed that advance across the bay would be uniform given the positive slope of each bay. Observed variation in the advance front between furrows within individual bays suggested advance was not uniform. Consequently, several furrows were instrumented in the subsequent irrigation season of 2008 / 2009. Evaluation results showed a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between trafficked (wheel) and non-trafficked (non-wheel) furrows for factors of furrow inflow rate, advance and furrow base elevation. On average, inflow rate into <b>wheel</b> <b>furrows</b> was 37 % higher than into non-wheel <b>furrows</b> and <b>wheel</b> <b>furrow</b> base elevation averaged 17 mm lower than non-wheel furrows, or 38 % of the design furrow elevation. As a result of this variation between furrows, a considerable negative crop response was anticipated. However, while insufficient crop samples were collected to provide a statistically reliable analysis of within bay yield variation, field scale production yields were above the national production average suggesting any impact to be less than anticipated. It is assumed that post-irrigation lateral redistribution of profile moisture may mitigate variability, especially in the fields of this study where an equal ratio of <b>wheel</b> and non-wheel <b>furrows</b> existed. In contrast to the measured variation within individual bays, application depths varied considerably between bays during each irrigation event. In one measured irrigation the highest application depth was 255 % of the lowest applied depth. It was concluded, {{as a result of this}} substantial variation, that the greatest potential for improving irrigation performance in BCISs was in reducing the variability in applied depths between individual bays. To reduce variability, an understanding of the design and management features that affect application depth in BCISs was required. Consequently, the potential of various hydraulic simulation models was examined. Despite a number of hydraulic models with capacity to simulate various aspects of BCISs, none had capacity to describe irrigation at both the bay and field scales. Consequently, a simulation model was developed to describe both within-bay irrigation and the hydraulic interaction between bays; viz the B 2 B model. To achieve this, a surface irrigation hydraulic design model (Clemmens, 2007 a,b) was adapted to accommodate the elements associated with a positive field slope. Parallel routines of this model where then coupled using a routine based adaptation of the Darcy-Weisbach equation to describe bay-to-bay hydraulics, thus enabling hydraulic simulation of an entire BCIS field. B 2 B simulations were then used to demonstrate the capacity of the model and to test the sensitivity of BCISs to various design and management variables. Current assumptions within the B 2 B model limit the model to describing general trends in Distribution Uniformity (DU). This capacity provides an important tool to examine the effect design and management variables have on the performance of the system. Variables examined within this dissertation include bay dimensions, the vertical separation between bays, slope, field supply rate, delivery pipe capacity, irrigation deficits and duration. The results showed DU down the furrow to be more sensitive to adjustments in bay length than width, with performance declining as completion of advance became reliant on field supply ‘base’ flow. As the vertical step between bays was increased, an increase in furrow inflow was apparent, commensurate with the increasing hydraulic head between the bays. However, despite the higher inflow, the impact on overall irrigation performance was relatively minor. The higher inflows generated a faster advance. However, the benefits of the higher discharge lasted for a shorter duration. This resulted in a reliance on the ‘base’ flow, similar to the above, for completion of advance which ultimately undermined the performance gains generated by the higher, but short duration inflows. Similar results were achieved for scenarios where pipe diameter, and thus capacity were increased. B 2 B simulations of slope indicated that any increase in slope reduces DU in the field. Furthermore, as slope increases, the depth of flow at the furrow inlet increases to a point where waterlogging at the inlet end of the bay is apparent. However, the presence of some slope within the bay reduced the risk of internal drainage and also assisted in the management of irrigation water where topographical constraints limit the ‘step’ between bays. Where water ‘backs up’ into the upstream bay, the presence of a positive field slope assists in constraining water to the bankless channel. Increasing the field deficit improved the simulated DU for each bay. However, to satisfy the higher deficits irrigation duration was increased. For the infiltration characteristic used in these simulations, a prolonger irrigation interval was required resulting in the accumulation of a considerable surface storage volume, and thus depth, in each bay. While simulations were theoretical, it was concluded that consideration must be given to water depth when increasing irrigation deficits. The B 2 B model provides a design simulation capacity providing a useful resource for describing trends in irrigation performance across a BCIS field. However, the model relies on reliable estimates of the infiltration characteristic of a field and does not simulate variation within individual bays. Consequently, evaluation of irrigation performance is required using field measurement. To effectively evaluate and determine suitable infiltration parameters for a field, this research identified several necessary field measurements as necessary: relative furrow elevation, furrow and bay inlet/outlet discharge, furrow advance and water depth at the furrow inlet. These measurements enable the infiltration characteristic for a field to be estimated and provide an insight into the uniformity of application between the bays of a field. ...|$|R
