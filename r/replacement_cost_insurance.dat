40|$|We {{investigate}} {{properties of}} employee <b>replacement</b> <b>costs,</b> using a panel survey of California businesses in 2003 and 2008. We establish that <b>replacement</b> <b>costs</b> are substantial relative to annual wages {{and that they}} are associated negatively with the use of seniority in promotion. We also find some evidence, albeit not under all specifications, that <b>replacement</b> <b>costs</b> are positively associated with establishment size, which is consistent with monopsony. Bivariate scatterplots, pooled regressions and panel-based estimates suggest a positive relationship between <b>replacement</b> <b>costs</b> and the wage. While this result is not robust, it constitutes a puzzle for hiring and separation models, such as Manning (2003). In these models, the negative wage elasticity of <b>replacement</b> <b>costs</b> is a key assumption. These results thus call for further research on employment costs models...|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} {{performance of}} three column configurations {{often used for}} adsorption systems serving small communities was evaluated in terms of which results in the lowest overall <b>replacement</b> <b>cost.</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>cost</b> {{is the cost of}} fresh media and the transportation, labor, and material costs to replace the media. Both the adsorption capacity and the media <b>replacement</b> <b>costs</b> were modeled. The pore and surface diffusion model was utilized to simulate the fixed-bed adsorption and obtain the breakthrough curves, which were then normalized using the target effluent to influent concentration ratio (C/Co) and the mass transfer zone fraction (%MTZBT). Normalization methods for <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> were developed in part based on cost data from the US EPA Arsenic Treatment Technology Demonstration Program. Two factors were found to be most important for the relative <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> of each configuration â€“ the frequency which at least one column needed replacement of media, and the cycle <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> (CRCost) as a combination of the fresh media <b>cost</b> and the <b>replacement</b> service <b>cost.</b> The lead-lag configuration has the lowest annual <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> at low target C/Co, high %MTZBT, and high CRCost ratios. The parallel configuration performs better at high target C/Co, high %MTZBT, and high CRCost ratios. Although the single configuration (two columns operated operated in tandem and replaced at the same time) has a higher media consumption compared to lead-lag and parallel, it can result in the lowest <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> at short %MTZBT and a very low CRCost ratios due to less frequent media replacements.

Previous empirical work - mainly based on aggregate-level data - has found only little evidence of such a relationship. By using a unique data set, covering transactions of single-family houses over a 25 years period, we establish {{strong support for the}} relationship at the micro level. In the time series context, we find that new house prices and <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> align quickly after a shock. In the cross-sectional context, we find prices of old houses and <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> are closely related once building depreciation has been taken into account.

50|$|Insurance {{policies}} may {{be purchased}} utilizing several different valuation methods. These include: <b>Replacement</b> <b>Cost</b> Value (RCV), Fixed Value (Guaranteed <b>Replacement</b> <b>Cost)</b> and Actual Cash Value (ACV). Some policies will use different valuation methods {{depending upon the}} item. For example, the building may be insured at <b>Replacement</b> <b>Cost</b> Value, {{the most of the}} contents insured at Actual Cash Value and a few specific items at a Fixed Value (antiques). Policies may also include co-insurance clause or deductibles provisions which will impact the actual cash paid out by the insurance company.|$|R
50|$|There are {{the three}} types of <b>insurance</b> {{coverage}}. <b>Replacement</b> <b>cost</b> coverage pays the cost of repairing or replacing your property with like kind & quality regardless of depreciation or appreciation. Premiums for this type of coverage are based on <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> values, and not based on actual cash value. Actual cash value coverage provides for <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> minus depreciation. Extended <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> will pay over the coverage limit if the costs for construction have increased. This generally will not exceed 25% of the limit. When you obtain an insurance policy, the limit is the maximum amount of benefit the insurance company will pay for a given situation or occurrence. Limits also include the ages below or above what an insurance company will not issue a new policy or continue a policy.|$|R

40|$|Methodology adopted for asset {{valuation}} {{is important to}} know how comparable the rates of profit are over time and between companies. Higher profitability calculated on the basis of book value of assets or historical cost basis may in fact conceal the erosion of the value of investment due to inflation over time. On the other hand, technical advancement may have significantly reduced the <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> of assets. Consequently, new comers in the industry may appear to be doing better compared to the existing firms if they do not adopt <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> valuation of assets. However, replacement value may differ if individual components of a facility are replaced separately from the <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> for the entire facility. <b>Replacement</b> <b>cost</b> is not just cost of reproducing the existing plant or plant in question. When replaced in its entirety new features are sometimes added and the facility may work better. In either case, <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> may in some cases be larger than the net present value of the future stream of income (NPV) from the existing plant or the net resale value (NRV) of that. In such cases, calculation of profit on the basis of <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> would underestimate the performance of such firms. In order to address such issues of comparative performance assessment an increasing number of economists, policy makers and accountants have recommended the use of deprival value method for valuation of assets. The deprival value is the lesser of the depreciated <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> and economic value of assets to the business. The economic value, in turn, is larger of the NPV and the NRV. This paper presents a comparative picture of the major {{asset valuation}} methods and discusses their relevance in context of the Government Trading Enterprises of Bangladesh. ...|$|R
