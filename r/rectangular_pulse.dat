40|$|We have {{experimentally}} observed conventional solitons and <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulses</b> in an erbium-doped {{fiber laser}} operating at anomalous dispersion regime. The <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulses</b> exhibit broad quasi-Gaussian spectra (similar to 40 nm) and triangular autocorrelation traces.

It is demonstrated that high-energy pulses can be realized in anomalous-dispersion regime, and may be explained as dissipative soliton resonance.

40|$|Abstract:- A {{duty cycle}} control circuit for clock signals is presented. The {{proposed}} circuit uses a rising edge detector to generate one shot output signals {{which have the}} same frequency of the input clock signal. A pulse width controllable monostable multivibrator converts the one shot signals into <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulses.</b> By the feedback control voltage from an operational amplifier, the pulse width of generated <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulses</b> is automatically adjusted to a pre-set duty cycle. As compared to prior arts, features of this proposed circuit include simple design, low cost and less power...|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{the central}} limit theorem, the Gaussian can be {{approximated}} by several runs of a very simple filter such as the moving average. The simple moving average corresponds to convolution with the constant B-spline ( [...] a <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulse</b> [...] ), and, for example, four iterations of a moving average yields a cubic B-spline as filter window which approximates the Gaussian quite well.|$|E
50|$|In {{a binary}} direct-sequence system, each chip is {{typically}} a <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulse</b> of +1 or -1 amplitude, which is multiplied by a data sequence (similarly +1 or -1 representing the message bits) {{and by a}} carrier waveform to make the transmitted signal.

40|$|The {{parameters}} of two stochastic models of point rainfall, the Bartlett-Lewis {{model and the}} Poisson <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulses</b> model, are estimated for each {{month of the year}} from the historical records of hourly precipitation at more than seventy first-order stations in the continental United States.

The Poisson <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulses</b> parameters are useful in implementing models of the land surface water balance. The Bartlett-Lewis parameters are useful in disaggregating precipitation to a time period shorter than that of existing observations. Information is also included on a floppy disk...|$|R
25|$|In communications, multiple-access schemes are {{orthogonal}} when {{an ideal}} receiver can completely reject arbitrarily strong unwanted {{signals from the}} desired signal using different basis functions. One such scheme is TDMA, where the orthogonal basis functions are nonoverlapping <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulses</b> ("time slots").|$|R
2500|$|Practical digital-to-analog {{converters}} produce neither scaled {{and delayed}} sinc functions, nor ideal Dirac pulses. Instead they produce a piecewise-constant sequence of scaled and delayed <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulses</b> (the zero-order hold), usually {{followed by an}} [...] "anti-imaging filter" [...] to clean up spurious high-frequency content.|$|R
50|$|This {{filtering}} of the transmitted signal {{affects the}} shape of the pulse that arrives at the receiver. The effects of filtering a <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulse</b> not only change {{the shape of}} the pulse within the first symbol period, but it is also spread out over the subsequent symbol periods. When a message is transmitted through such a channel, the spread pulse of each individual symbol will interfere with following symbols.|$|E
50|$|MakeUEF is a Windows {{application}} {{written by}} Thomas Harte and expanded by Fraser Ross to convert audio samples into UEF files. Two grades are offered. An 'amateur' version reads WAV files or a live signal played {{to the sound}} card, and transcribes only standard data blocks with accuracy. The 'professional' grade accepts only CSW files, which represent waves preprocessed into <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulse</b> trains, but it encodes all audio information supported by the UEF specification.|$|E
50|$|Transmission {{lines are}} also used as pulse generators. By {{charging}} the transmission line and then discharging it into a resistive load, a <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulse</b> equal in length to twice the electrical length of the line can be obtained, although with half the voltage. A Blumlein transmission line is a related pulse forming device that overcomes this limitation. These are sometimes used as the pulsed power sources for radar transmitters and other devices.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} DACs output a {{sequence}} of piecewise constant values (known as zero-order hold in sample data textbooks) or <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulses</b> causes multiple harmonics above the Nyquist frequency.

50|$|These can {{be found}} in pulse waves, square waves, boxcar functions, and {{rectangular}} functions. In digital signals the up and down transitions between high and low levels are called the rising edge and the falling edge. In digital systems the detection of these sides or action taken in response is termed edge-triggered, rising or falling depending on which side of <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulse.</b> A digital timing diagram {{is an example of a}} well-ordered collection of rectangular pulses.|$|E
50|$|Its {{drawbacks}} {{are that}} it is not self-clocking and it has a significant DC component, which can be halved by using return-to-zero, where the signal returns to zero {{in the middle of the}} bit period. With a 50% duty cycle each <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulse</b> is only at a positive voltage for half of the bit period. This is ideal if one symbol is sent much more often than the other and power considerations are necessary, and also makes the signal self-clocking.|$|E
50|$|To {{minimize}} {{distortion of}} the pulse shape, a pulse transformer needs to have low values of leakage inductance and distributed capacitance, and a high open-circuit inductance. In power-type pulse transformers, a low coupling capacitance (between the primary and secondary) is important to protect the circuitry on the primary side from high-powered transients created by the load. For the same reason, high insulation resistance and high breakdown voltage are required. A good transient response is necessary to maintain the <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulse</b> shape at the secondary, because a pulse with slow edges would create switching losses in the power semiconductors.|$|E

5000|$|A PFN {{consists}} {{of a series of}} high voltage energy storage capacitors and inductors. These components are interconnected as a [...] "ladder network" [...] that behaves similarly to a length of transmission line. For this reason, a PFN is sometimes called an [...] "artificial, or synthetic, transmission line". Electrical energy is initially stored within the charged capacitors of the PFN by a high voltage DC power supply. When the PFN is discharged the capacitors discharge in sequence, producing an approximately <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulse.</b> The pulse is conducted to the load through a transmission line.

5000|$|The Fourier {{operator}} {{defines a}} continuous two-dimensional function that extends along time and frequency axes, outwards to infinity {{in all four}} directions. This {{is analogous to the}} DFT matrix but, in this case, is continuous and infinite in extent. The value of the function at any point is such that it has the same magnitude everywhere. Along any fixed value of time, the value of the function varies as a complex exponential in frequency. Likewise along any fixed value of frequency the value of the function varies as a complex exponential in time.

5000|$|A {{straightforward}} way {{to approximate}} an integral, {{such as a}} Fourier integral, {{is to use the}} standard 'rectangle rule' for numerical integration.
