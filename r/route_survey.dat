2500|$|The {{original}} pipeline project {{started in}} 1997 when Gazprom and the Finnish company Neste (in 1998 merged with Imatran Voima to form Fortum, and 2004 separated again to Fortum and Neste Oil) formed the joint company North Transgas Oy for construction {{and operation of}} a gas pipeline from Russia to Northern Germany across the Baltic Sea. [...] North Transgas cooperated with the German gas company Ruhrgas (became later part of E.ON). A <b>route</b> <b>survey</b> in the Exclusive Economic Zones of Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany, and a feasibility study of the pipeline was conducted in 1998.

2500|$|Survey {{teams were}} put out to produce {{detailed}} contour {{maps of the}} options on the different routes. The engineering team looked at the available surveys and chose what was the [...] "best" [...] <b>route.</b> <b>Survey</b> teams {{under the direction of}} the engineers closely led the work crews and marked where and by how much hills would have to be cut and depressions filled or bridged. Coordinators made sure that construction and other supplies were provided when and where needed, and additional supplies were ordered as the railroad construction consumed the supplies. Specialized bridging, explosive and tunneling teams were assigned to their specialized jobs. Some jobs like explosive work, tunneling, bridging, heavy cuts or fills were known to take longer than others, so the specialized teams were sent out ahead by wagon trains with the supplies and men to get these jobs done by the time the regular track-laying crews arrived. Finance officers made sure the supplies were paid for and men paid for their work. An army of men had to be coordinated and a seemingly never-ending chain of supplies had to be provided. The Central Pacific road crew set a track-laying record by laying [...] of track in a single day, commemorating the event with a signpost beside the track for passing trains to see.|$|E
6000|$|On October 26th, Dr. Güssfeldt, after {{shaking off}} the [...] "seasoning fever" [...] at Ponta Negra, {{proceeded}} {{to make a}} trial trip, and a <b>route</b> <b>survey</b> with compass and chronometer, up the important Quillu River. As usual, it has a bar; within {{the last few years}} the right bank has been carried away by the floods, and some of the old factories are under water. The average breadth is 400 paces, which diminishes to 25 at the rocky [...] "gates" [...] near Kama- Chitoma, Manyamatal and Gotu. At 29 direct miles from the mouth lies [...] "Chimbak," [...] a trading station, where Dr. Güssfeldt rested and recruited strength for a month. Thence he went leisurely up stream to the Bumina Rapids, and found the easterly rhumb of the river bending to the N.E. and the N.N.E.; its channel did not exceed 50 yards in width, and precipitous rock-walls rose on either hand. At Bumina as at Gotu the Quillu breaks through the parallel lines of Ghats, whose trend is from N.W. to S.E.; in fact, these [...] "Katarakten" [...] are the Yellalas of the Congo. A march of four hours brought him to the Mayombe country (circ. S. Lat. 4°), which must not be confounded with the Ma-yumba or northernmost possession of the Congo kingdom; the latter word properly means [...] "King of Yumba," [...] as Ma-Loango is Mwani-Loango. The Mayombe chief proved friendly, and assisted Dr. Güssfeldt to hire bearers (November 7) for Yangela, where his excursion ended. The boundary-line is marked by a large gate, like the two openings in the wooden wall denoting the Loango frontier between the Quillu and Luema rivers. The character of the country changed to the normal park-like aspect of Africa above the Ghats; the dense forests waxed thin; picturesque views presented themselves, reminding the wayfarer of Switzerland; and bare, dome-shaped mountains formed the background. At Nsunsi, about 2,100 feet above sea-level, the eye ranged over the Yangela country, as far as the land of the Batetye, whose grassy plains are traversed by ranges trending to the W.S.W., and apparently culminating to the south. At the Tondo village the skull of a gorilla was remarked. The upper Quillu, after its great bend, proved to be 350 to 400 paces broad; and the traveller ascertained that, instead of being connected with the great artery, it rises in a lake nearly due north of Nsundi (Sundi), near the country of the Babongo and the Babum. Dr. Güssfeldt returned to the coast on December 2, and prepared for the great march into the interior.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{the characteristics of}} <b>route</b> and <b>survey</b> processing of a unique complex virtual environment both at the behavioral and brain levels. Prior to fMRI scanning, participants were trained to follow a route and to learn the spatial relationships between several places, acquiring both <b>route</b> and <b>survey</b> knowledge from a ground-level perspective. During scanning, snapshots of the environment were presented, and participants were required to either indicate the direction to take to follow the route (route task), or to locate unseen targets (survey task). Data suggest that <b>route</b> and <b>survey</b> processing are mainly supported by a common occipito-fronto-parieto-temporal neural network. Our {{results are consistent with}} those gathered in studies concerning the neural bases of <b>route</b> versus <b>survey</b> knowledge acquired either from different perspectives or in different environments. However, rather than arguing for a clear distinction between <b>route</b> and <b>survey</b> processing, “mixed” strategies are likely to be involved when both types of encoding take place in the same environment...|$|R
