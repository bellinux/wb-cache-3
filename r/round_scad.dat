25|$|Terengganu laksa (Malay: Laksa Terengganu) is {{the easiest}} laksa recipe that is famous among peoples {{from the town of}} Kuala Terengganu of the Terengganu state, located at the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The main {{ingredient}} of Terengganu Laksa's sauce is ikan kembong or <b>round</b> <b>scad</b> mackerel that are boiled and minced. The minced fish are fried with onions, garlic, ginger, datil pepper, belacan, kantan flower, Vietnamese coriander or daun kesum, lemon grass and dried tamarind slice. Coconut milk will then be added as the final ingredient and stirred until it is all mixed up and becomes thick. Terengganu Laksa is served just like the Italian spaghetti by adding ulam (raw vegetables) and blended chili on the side. Another variable of Terengganu Laksa is Laksam. The sauce's recipe are exactly the same but the noodles are a bit bigger and flat.|$|E
50|$|The <b>round</b> <b>scad</b> is a cigar-shaped fish, with greenish {{coloration}} on top {{and white}} below. Their opercles usually have a small, black spot. The <b>round</b> <b>scad</b> has nine spines on its dorsal fin and 30 to 34 soft rays. Their anal fins have only three spines and 26-29 soft rays. <b>Round</b> <b>scad</b> often have a yellow stripe running from the head to the caudal peduncle. The longest <b>round</b> <b>scad</b> recorded was 30 centimeters long, which is {{not far from the}} average estimated adult length of 12 inches (30.48 cm).

50|$|Decapterus is a genus {{of marine}} fishes {{in the family}} in the jack family, Carangidae, {{commonly}} known as mackerel <b>scads,</b> <b>round</b> <b>scads,</b> or horse mackerel. They are found throughout the world.|$|R
50|$|Agricultural {{resources}} include rice, mangoes, legumes, {{vegetables and}} coffee. It also has aquatic resources like <b>round</b> <b>scads,</b> grouper, mussel, and abalone; mineral deposits of granite and basalt and forest products like vines and bamboo.|$|R
50|$|<b>Round</b> <b>scad</b> {{make their}} home in the ocean's Neritic zone and are also common near beaches. They are also known to gather near the bottom in large shoals. <b>Round</b> <b>scad</b> mostly eat copepods, but have also been known to eat pteropods, ostracods, and {{gastropod}} larvae.|$|E

50|$|Decapterus russelli, the Indian Scad, Northern {{mackerel}} scad, <b>round</b> <b>scad,</b> Russell's mackerel scad, slender scad or {{the three}} lined grunter, is {{a species of}} ray-finned fish of the genus Decapterus {{which is part of}} the family Carangidae and which occurs in the Indian Ocean. It has colonised the eastern Mediterranean through the Suez Canal. It is an important species in coastal fisheries throughput its range.|$|E
50|$|With {{regards to}} the type of fishing gears, the {{majority}} of the fisherman uses hook and the line type. The species caught using this type are frigate tunas, big eye scads, yellow fin tunas, pacific sailfish groupers, Spanish mackerels and slip mouth, <b>round</b> <b>scads,</b> maya-maya, flying fish, bumo and saray. Other types gears used are spear guns, gillnets and the casting net. The municipality of San Luis together with BFAR has provided payaos to fisherman association of coastal barangays to increase fish catch of fisherman.|$|R
50|$|The {{blackfin}} scad has a body profile {{very similar}} to that of the other <b>round</b> <b>scads</b> of the genus Alepes, in particular to Alepes apercna, but can be distinguished quite easily by the prominent black colouration of the dorsal fin. The species has a tendency, like other carangids, to become more elongated with age, thus changing their body proportions slightly. It has an oblong, compressed body with dorsal and ventral profiles that are nearly equally convex in shape. The nose somewhat blunter than others in the genus, and has a mouth full of numerous comb like teeth. Like other members of Alepes, it has an adipose eyelid which is well developed only on the posterior section of the eye. The dorsal fin is split into two sections like in all of the Carangidae, the first with 7 or 8 spines and the second with one spine followed by 23 to 26 soft rays. The anal fin consists of two detached spines followed by a single spine and 18 to 21 soft rays, with both the anal and dorsal fins have a low profile. The pectoral fin is falcate and extends to beyond the junction of the curved and straight sections of the lateral line. The lateral line itself is strongly arched anteriorally, with the curved and straight sections of the line intersecting just after the commencement of the spinous dorsal fin. The curved section of the lateral line holds 31 to 50 scales and up to 2 scutes, while the straight section holds up to 4 scales and 49 to 69 scutes. The gill rakers number 24 to 30 and the species has 24 vertebrae. The blackfin scad has a maximum known length of 25 cm.|$|R
40|$|Research PaperOver {{exploitation}} of the coastal fisheries resources in Southeast Asia region {{is the cause of}} many problems either conflict among the fishermen or depletion of the coastal environment. In order to find out the way to solve those problems, Set-Net fishing was proposed {{to be used as a}} kind of tool for the coastal fisheries management development. Set-Net does not function only to harvest fisheries resources but its construction also provided shelter and substrate for living marine organism to create their communities in the food chain of coastal marine ecosystem. Seven small scale fishermen groups of Mae Rumpheung beach which located on the east coast of the Gulf of Thailand, were selected as the experimental samples and site for case study in Thailand. Over two hundred fishermen have generally earned their lives on this coastal waters with seven types of fishing gears: crab bottom gillnet, crab trap, squid trap, squid jigging, fish trap, handlines and fish gillnet. Some commercial fishing boats from other area are also presently operated anchovy purse seine and anchovy fishing with light on this area. So that they should pay high responsibility on their own coastal resources and environmental conservation under the concept of decentralization policy. One set of set-net "Otoshi-ami" was constructed and installed at 14 meters depth fishing ground of coastal waters, five groups of fishermen were arranged for fishing operation alternately under control of the Set-net Operation Administrative and Management Committee. It could harvest various species of their coastal resources mainly yellowstrip <b>scad,</b> <b>round</b> herring, sardine, indian mackerel, Indo-Pacific mackerel and squid. There are also a lot of fishes and others marine organism gathering and living around and on the set-net construction both pelagic and demersal species. It is shown that the coastal resources communities were developed around the set-net area more than other empty area of this waters. So that, the vicinity area around set net construction is become a good fishing ground for small-scale fishing activities, however it should be managed by the committee or the cooperative in future...|$|R

The types of fish that normally used to process these fish crackers are the Wolf herring (Ikan parang), Sardines (Ikan tamban), <b>Round</b> <b>scad</b> (Ikan selayang), Threadfin bream (Ikan kerisi), Ox-eyed scad (Ikan lolong bara), Goatfish (Ikan biji nangka), Lizard fish (Ikan conor) and many others.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{its long}} {{coastline}} {{and the presence}} of numerous marshes and bays, fishing is also {{a large part of the}} province's economy. Quezon accounts for 33% or around 132,239 MT of fish produced in the region. Several fish port complexes exist in the province, including ports in Atimonan, Lucena, Infanta, and Guinayangan. These ports serve as hubs for the trade of fish and other aquatic resources like <b>round</b> <b>scad,</b> anchovies, tuna, and groupers. The province has three fishing districts. The first is found in the northeast encompassing Lamon Bay. The southeast portion includes the Ragay Gulf while the south central portion covers Tayabas Bay. Aside from fishing, aquaculture is also important in the coastal municipalities of the province. Bangus and prawns are among the most cultured species.|$|E

As to the dropping rate of the bait, saury showed the highest rate of 68. 9 %; one of the dropping-causes was ascertained to by {{due to the fact that}} the bait was hooked un-melted. 4. These hooking rates are assumed to be influenced by some differences in the motions, in the flowing water, of these three kinds of baits, saury, <b>round</b> <b>scad</b> and mackerel. 5. In short, the possibility of using the frozen <b>round</b> <b>scad</b> for a bait of tuna-long-line was ascertained in these experiments. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present data}} on ichthyoplankton distribution, abundance, and {{seasonality}} and supporting environmental information for four species of coastal pelagics {{from the family}} Carangidae: blue runner Caranx crysos, Atlantic bumper Chloroscombrus chrysurus, <b>round</b> <b>scad</b> Decapterus punctatus, and rough scad Trachurus lathami. Data are from 1982 and 1983 cruises off Louisiana sponsored by the Southeastern Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP). Bioprofiles on reproductive biology, early life history, meristics, adult distribution, and fisheries characteristics are also presented for these species. Maximum abundances of larval blue runner, Atlantic bumper, and <b>round</b> <b>scad</b> were found in July inside the 4 O-m isobath, although {{during the rest of}} the cruises these species were rarely found together. Larval Atlantic bumper were captured in June and July only; blue runner in May, June, and July; and <b>round</b> <b>scad</b> in all seasons. Atlantic bumper larvae, concentrated mostly off western Louisiana, were by far the most abundant carangid in 1982 and 1983. Larval blue runner were the second most abundant summer-spawned carangid in 1982 and 1983, but their abundance and depth distribution varied considerably between years. Relative abundance of larval <b>round</b> <b>scad</b> off Louisiana was low, and they were captured only west of the Mississippi River delta, although they are reported to dominate carangid populations in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Rough scad were primarily winter/spring and outer-shelf (40 - 182 m) spawners. They ranked third in overall abundance, but were the most abundant target carangid on the outer shelf. Ecological parameters such as surface salinity, temperature, and station depth are presented from capture sites for recently hatched larvae < 2. 5 mm notochord length, except <b>round</b> <b>scad)</b> as well as for all sizes of fish below 14 mm standard length.

The calculated daily dose of total mercury of 0. 06 µg d- 1 kg- 1 body weight indicates that consumption of any one or any combination of bangus, tilapia, and galunggong sold in Nepa-Q-Mart from August 5 to October 20 in 2004 does not entail risk of adverse neurological effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of circle hook and J-hook in pelagic longline fishery were determined in 13 fishing stations in three designated areas. The research/training vessel, namely M. V. SEAFDEC, was employed for the fishing operations during 5 November to 4 December 2007. The survey area was mutually defined as area A: latitude 16 °N- 19 °N and longitude 88 °E- 91 °E (5 stations), area B: latitude 9 °N- 14 °N and longitude 82 °E- 85 °E (4 stations), area C: latitude 10 °N- 12 °N and longitude 95 °E- 97 °E (4 stations). The main {{objective of this}} work is to evaluate the {{efficiency of}} 18 / 0 10 ° offset circle hook {{in comparison with the}} J-hook using three different types of baits i. e., <b>round</b> <b>scad</b> (Decapterus sp.), milk fish (Chanos chanos) and Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta). A total of 6, 277 hooks was deployed during the survey program. The results appeared that, using circle hook, the percentage compositions of target fish (tuna and billfish) and by-catch fish were not much different, 46. 67 % and 53. 33 % respectively. In contrast, J-hook showed a higher difference between these 2 components, target fish 25. 53 % and by-catch fish 74. 47 %. Considering catch rates, in overall CPUE (individual/ 1, 000 hooks) of circle hook was lower than that of J-hook (4. 77 versus 7. 48). When separated by fish group, for target fish the CPUE of circle hook was a little higher than J-hook (2. 23 versus 1. 91), but for by-catch fish the CPUE of J-hook was obviously higher (5. 58 versus 2. 55). Regarding to hooking position, the percentage of hooking position in mouth using circle hook was higher than that of J-hook (73. 33 % versus 53. 19 %) but the percentage in digestive system was lower (10 % versus 38. 3 %) ...|$|E
