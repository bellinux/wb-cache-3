5|$|The mass, radius and {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} {{are closely}} interlinked, and their respective values can be approximated by three relations. First is the Stefan–Boltzmann law, which <b>relates</b> <b>the</b> luminosity L, the radius R and the surface temperature Teff. Second is the mass–luminosity relation, which <b>relates</b> <b>the</b> luminosity L and the mass M. Finally, the relationship between M and R is close to linear. The ratio of M to R increases {{by a factor of}} only three over 2.5 orders of magnitude of M. This relation is roughly proportional to the star's inner temperature TI, and its extremely slow increase reflects the fact that the rate of energy generation in the core strongly depends on this temperature, whereas it has to fit the mass–luminosity relation. Thus, a too high or too low temperature will result in stellar instability.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the (2,0)-theory {{has proven}} to be {{important}} for studying the general properties of quantum field theories. Indeed, this theory subsumes many mathematically interesting effective quantum field theories and points to new dualities relating these theories. For example, Luis Alday, Davide Gaiotto, and Yuji Tachikawa showed that by compactifying this theory on a surface, one obtains a four-dimensional quantum field theory, and there is a duality known as the AGT correspondence which <b>relates</b> <b>the</b> physics of this theory to certain physical concepts associated with the surface itself. More recently, theorists have extended these ideas to study the theories obtained by compactifying down to three dimensions.|$|E

Moreover the recent development of Lonergan’s four-point hypothesis offers a more profound account of the church as an “icon” of the Trinity. Not only are such approaches more solidly grounded in trinitarian theology; they also provide interesting opportunities for <b>relating</b> <b>the</b> church to other religious traditions...|$|R

Various adventures and misadventures befall Pym, including shipwreck, mutiny, and cannibalism, before he is saved by {{the crew of the}} Jane Guy. Aboard this vessel, Pym and a sailor named Dirk Peters continue their adventures farther south. Docking on land, they encounter hostile black-skinned natives before escaping back to the ocean. The novel ends abruptly as Pym and Peters continue toward the South Pole.|$|E
5|$|The band {{structure}} of carbon nanotubes having certain (n,m) indexes {{can be easily}} calculated. A theoretical graph based on this calculations was designed in 1999 by Hiromichi Kataura to rationalize experimental findings. A Kataura plot <b>relates</b> <b>the</b> nanotube diameter and its bandgap energies for all nanotubes in a diameter range. The oscillating shape of every branch of the Kataura plot reflects the intrinsic strong dependence of the SWCNT properties on the (n,m) index rather than on its diameter. For example, (10,1) and (8,3) tubes have almost the same diameter, but very different properties: the former is a metal, but {{the latter is a}} semiconductor.|$|E
