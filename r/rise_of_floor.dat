40|$|The {{effect of}} hull-mounted {{cavitating}} spoilers system on ship stability is studied experimentally and numerically. The injection of air or exhaust gas stabilizes cavities behind spoilers. The spoiler system is tested experimentally {{to understand the}} parameters affecting the flow field and bubble formation around such spoiler. These parameters are the spoiler inclination angle, <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> <b>floor</b> angle and injected air position. The spoiler inclination angle effect is studied in this paper. The images of bubble formation and flow filed variation are recorded with scientific video camera and compared with the computed flow field at different conditions and time sequence. The two-phase flow-field around a ship spoiler with the free surface simulation in Piecewise Linear Interface Construction method is modeled numerically using a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes code. The bubbles shape, the three-dimensional flow field around the spoiler body and the pressure variation on {{the wake of the}} spoiler body are computed. The comparison between the numerical and experimental results shows a good matching of bubble formation in the cases of spoiler with 60 ° and 90 ° inclinatio...|$|E

The north transept now has four large wood-and-steel lateral trusses at different heights, installed during the 1990s to keep the transept from collapsing (see photograph).

However, it is not known if this was ever used on commercial flights. In 2015, Sell GMBH, a German division of aeroplane equipment company Zodiac Aerospace, filed patent for a food delivery mechanism that would distribute food using automated conveyor belts, allowing passengers to access their food on demand by pressing buttons on the in-flight entertainment system, causing the food distributor to <b>rise</b> out <b>of</b> the <b>floor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In geology, a resurgent dome is a dome {{formed by}} {{swelling}} or <b>rising</b> <b>of</b> a caldera <b>floor</b> due to {{movement in the}} magma chamber beneath it. Unlike a lava dome, a resurgent dome is not formed by the extrusion of highly viscous lava onto the surface, but rather by the uplift and deformation of the surface itself by magma movement underground. Resurgent domes are typically found {{near the center of}} very large open calderas such as Yellowstone Caldera or Valles Caldera, and in turn such calderas are often referred to as [...] "resurgent-type" [...] calderas to distinguish them from the more common (but much smaller) calderas found on shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes.|$|R

50|$|In this film, the Batcave is {{accessed}} {{through a}} rotating shelf {{which led to}} a staircase in Wayne Manor's silver closet, the only room in the mansion that is kept locked. The cave can also be reached via a secret tunnel system from Bruce Wayne's office at Wayne Enterprises, through which he rides down in a capsule. The cave features the main computer, as well as a crime lab where Bruce examined various riddles sent by the Riddler. The cave has a canal inside of it, which provides access to the sea for water-based vehicles. The cave also includes a lengthy tunnel used to launch the Batwing, which emerges from the cliffs underneath Wayne Manor. The cave features a rotating turntable that <b>rises</b> out <b>of</b> the <b>floor,</b> holding the Batmobile, and a large dome-like structure where Bruce's Batsuits and gadgets are stored.|$|R

50|$|The monumental five-story {{limestone}} {{building was}} {{designed in the}} Academic Greek Revival style. The original 1932 building is approximately 251' wide and 151' deep; and the east wing addition of 1941, and west wing addition of 1987, extend the depth by 114' to approximately 265'. The composition of the main elevation consists of two projecting Greek distyle pavilions at {{the east and west}} ends resting upon a two-story rusticated base. The major horizontal zones of the building are clearly differentiated. The foundation and basement are gray granite, above which rise a first floor and mezzanine level of horizontally incised, rusticated limestone veneer, above which <b>rise</b> three <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> smooth finished (honed), flush jointed limestone which gives a monolithic appearance, except for fenestration and pilasters as described below.|$|R
50|$|The park's {{landscape}} {{has been}} shaped by plate tectonics, with the Pacific Plate subducting beneath the North American Plate. The process has lowered the elevation of the Kenai Mountains, gradually pulling glacial features down into the sea, {{which is at the}} same time <b>rising.</b> The <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> the fjords can be from 600 to 1000 ft below the present sea level. The motion of the North Pacific Plate has accreted a variety of terranes against the shoreline, so that the coastal region is a mixture of rocks that originated elsewhere, together with local igneous rock. Predominant rock types include shale and graywacke, with greenstone, tuff and chert. The erosive power of the glaciers produces sediment as rock flour coloring the waters around the toes of glaciers, carrying minerals into the ecosystem that support phytoplankton, which in turn sustain larger animals.|$|R
50|$|The Compton organ is a three manual {{instrument}} with {{a unique}} 150 stop tab layout which was designed for the Plaza and her sister cinema by Norman Cocker the resident organist from Manchester Cathedral and Arthur Ward {{one of the original}} Directors of the Stockport Plaza. It has in addition 42 toe and thumb pistons. There are 11 ranks of pipes situated in 2 chambers, one over the other {{to the right of the}} stage. These are concealed behind the decorative grill in the wall. There is no electric amplification, as the sound is produced acoustically straight from the organ pipes. The console is on a lift so that it can <b>rise</b> out <b>of</b> the <b>floor,</b> adding to the theatrical effect.As there is no amplification the organist controls the volume using swell pedals that operate shutters in the grill. It was played before shows, and during silent movies, variety acts and musical interludes between films.
