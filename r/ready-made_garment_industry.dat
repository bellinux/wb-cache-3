40|$|Women in Bangladesh have {{traditionally}} been excluded from taking part in social, political and economic activities by means of {{institutions such as the}} purdah (veil). However, the rise of the <b>ready-made</b> <b>garments</b> <b>industry</b> in Bangladesh since the 1970 s has provided women with opportunities to work outside the home for wages. This change coincided with changes such as a decline in the rural sector, increased emphasis on girls’ education and campaigns to improve women’s health and reduce fertility. As a result of these changes, the social exclusion of women has reduced considerably. This paper analyses existing literature on women’s employment in the <b>ready-made</b> <b>garments</b> <b>industry</b> in Bangladesh using a social exclusion framework. It finds that the impact of the industry on women’s exclusion is mixed. Women have greater economic independence, respect, social standing and “voice” than before. However, harassment and exploitation persists. Given the important changes that this industry is helping to bring into women’s lives, stakeholders should focus attention on making the industry a more humane and sustainable option for women...|$|R

Bangladesh {{is second only}} to China, the world's second-largest apparel exporter of western brands. Sixty percent of the export contracts of western brands are with European buyers and about forty percent with the American buyers. It has been a major source of employment for rural migrant women in a country that has increasingly limited rural livelihood options, and where women migrants have been largely excluded from formal work in the cities.The structure of gender participation underwent a major shift with the rise of the <b>ready-made</b> <b>garment</b> <b>industry</b> in Bangladesh. Estimates from the World Bank put the number of female workers in the industry in the 1980s at 50,000; that number was brought up to 2.85 million by 2008 and now probably lies over the 3 million mark. Traditionally the participation of women in Bangladesh's formal economy was minimal.

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of internationally traded goods are subject to labor standards and this proportion is on a continuing rise. Such developments created a hot debate {{about the impact of}} labor standards on trade, but there has been no clear international consensus on the net costs and benefits arising from such regulations on market access, export performance and competitiveness in developing countries. This study contributes to the debate by providing results from a survey of 83 firms in the textiles and <b>ready-made</b> <b>garments</b> <b>industry</b> in Egypt. The main result which derived from the descriptive analysis is that child labor is a phenomenon that exists in the textiles and <b>ready-made</b> <b>garments</b> <b>industry</b> with a relatively high share in the sample (16 %). All destinations receive exports that embody child labor; however, the non Western destinations seem to receive the lionï¿½s share. Moreover, it has been found that a {{large proportion}} of firms with child labor export more than 50 % of their output. The econometric findings which focus mainly on the determinants of the supply of core labor standards, suggest that first, several variables related to labor standards show a significant effect on the probability of a firm to export more than 50 % of its output and exclusively to the West (namely EU and the US). Second, variables which ensure the enforcement of labor standards have a higher explanatory power for the probability of a firm to perform well in exports than compliance and awareness variables. Third, firms are likely to self-enforce labor standards based on their expectation to improve their market access and the competitiveness of their export products. Thus, the driving forces leading to the implementation of higher labor standards at the firm level are of economic nature rather than social. And finally, for those firms with a high volume of exports to Arab countries and for smaller firms (both exporting to the West or Arab countries), the effect of standards might lead to export diversification.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{explosive}} growth in the Bangladeshi <b>ready-made</b> <b>garments</b> <b>industry</b> on the lives on Bangladeshi women.

Girls exposed to the garment sector delay marriage and childbirth. This stems from (a) young girls becoming more likely to be enrolled in school after garment jobs (which reward literacy and numeracy) arrive, and (b) older girls becoming more likely to be employed outside the home in garment-proximate villages. The demand for education generated through manufacturing growth appears to have a much larger effect on female educational attainment compared to a large-scale government conditional cash transfer program to encourage female schooling...|$|R

In the 1980 s, {{economic}} reforms created a job market for poor, uneducated rural women in the <b>ready-made</b> <b>garment</b> <b>industry,</b> mostly located in urban areas. This increased participation in paid work has changed the gender roles of these women. Women’s earnings support their family, {{but they are also}} separated from their children, with impacts on their mental health and well-being. This study explores the lived experience of women in Bangladesh working in the <b>ready-made</b> <b>garment</b> <b>industry</b> as they strive to be mothers and family providers, often in high-stress conditions. Methods: The study was conducted in two industrial areas of Dhaka over 8 months. Data collection included a literature review, 20 in-depth interviews with married female garment workers, and 14 key-informant interviews with officials from the Ministry of Labour and Employment, health-service providers within the garment factories, factory managers, and representatives of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. The data collected were analyzed thematically. Results: Poverty was a key motivating factor for female migrant workers to move from rural areas. Their children stay in their village with their grandparents, because of their mothers’ work conditions and the lack of childcare. The women reported stress, anxiety, restlessness, and thoughts of suicide, due to the double burden of work and separation from their children and family support. Further, they cannot easily access government hospital services due to their long work hours, and the limited medical services provided in the workplace do not meet their needs. Conclusion: In order to improve {{the health and well-being of}} female garment workers, steps should be taken to develop health interventions to meet the needs of this important group of workers who are contributing significantly to the economic development of the country.

40|$|Purpose: This thesis {{examines}} {{the effects of}} trade liberalisation on Bangladeshi female workers especially those working in <b>ready-made</b> <b>garments</b> <b>industry</b> {{in different parts of}} Bangladesh. Originality: The gendered disaggregated empirical analysis of the impact of trade liberalisation and comparison between different areas in Bangladesh is extremely important from a policy perspective in view of the disproportionate participation of women in the sector and also for the equal wellbeing of women as vulnerable group. Key literature / theoretical perspective: This research will first investigate whether there is a differential treatment to female garments workers in different industrial areas in terms of salary, working hours, promotion, and non-financial benefits e. g. long -term maternity leave, medical leave and others. Design/methodology/approach: Quantitative methods based on a primary database will be used to answer the research questions. Research limitations/implications: This thesis questions the assumption that in Bangladesh, trade liberation has created ample opportunities for young Bangladeshi female workers for paid jobs in export-oriented sectors but not equally all over the country. Practical and Social implications: As examining the socio-economic impact of trade liberalisation on female workers in different export oriented industries in general, an effort will be made to measure and compare the effects between selected industrial areas. The findings of this study will help policy makers of both the government and owners of the industry to find ways to augment welfare of female workers in the <b>garment</b> <b>industry</b> in general and other export-oriented industries in particular. 2 page(s...|$|R

This paper examines the current scenario of Bangladeshi women’s livelihood pursuant to safety measures implemented by retailers, manufacturers and other organizations globally under a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) to improve the situation of ready-made garment (RMG) industry workers. Notwithstanding persisting issues with labour standards and working conditions, the RMG sector is still the main source of employment and economic survival for Bangladeshi women. Although this sector does need reform in working conditions and labour standards, implementing the CAP could lead to a decline in women’s employment, negatively impacting the overall economy.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the late}} 1970 s, the <b>ready-made</b> <b>garment</b> (RMG) <b>industry</b> of Bangladesh started {{and became a}} player in the {{national}} economy. It is the common phenomenon that due to recent global economic recession almost all the countries in the globe fell into difficulties is going to overcome the recession. Nevertheless to say this might be more difficult for the developing country like Bangladesh. But fortunately for Bangladesh the prominent foreign exchange earning sectors (RMG & Remittance) showed the positive figure even in these bad days of economic recession. It is argued that this favorable outcome is due to two factors. First, the exports of Bangladesh are almost entirely consumer goods whose demand does not fall as sharply as income; and second, Bangladesh has acquired a competitive edge in the world apparel market. In this paper, we exploited the ways, concept and techniques which helped us a lot to overcome the difficulties and able to stabilize our economic improvement...|$|R
