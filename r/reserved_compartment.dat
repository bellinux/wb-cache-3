It has been my natural disposition to see this war as something purposeful and epic, as it is great, as an epoch, as [...] "the War that will end War"--but of that last, more anon. I do not think I am alone in this inclination to a dramatic and logical interpretation. The caricatures in the French shops show civilisation (and particularly Marianne) in conflict with a huge and hugely wicked Hindenburg Ogre. Well, I come back from this tour with something not so simple as that. If I were to be tied down to one word for my impression of this war, I should say that this war is Queer. It is not like anything in a really waking world, but like something in a dream. It hasn't exactly that clearness of light against darkness or of good against ill. But it has the quality of wholesome instinct struggling under a nightmare. The world is not really awake. This vague appeal for explanations {{to all sorts of}} people, this desire to exhibit the business, to get something in the way of elucidation at present missing, is extraordinarily suggestive of the efforts of the mind to wake up that will sometimes occur at a deep crisis. My memory of this tour I have just made is full of puzzled-looking men. I have seen thousands of poilus sitting about in cafes, by the roadside, in tents, in trenches, thoughtful. I have seen Alpini sitting restfully and staring with speculative eyes across the mountain gulfs towards unseen and unaccountable enemies. I have seen trainloads of wounded staring out of the ambulance train windows as we passed. I have seen these dim intimations of questioning reflection in the strangest juxtapositions; in Malagasy soldiers resting for a spell among the big shells they were hoisting into trucks for the front, in a couple of khaki-clad Maoris sitting upon the step of a horse-van in Amiens station. It is always the same expression one catches, rather weary, rather sullen, inturned. The shoulders droop. The very outline is a note of interrogation.

40|$|Liver parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) have a {{low rate}} of turnover, but can {{nevertheless}} mount a rapid and efficient regenerative response. However, in some cases of extreme hepatotoxicity hepatocyte proliferation is restricted or even abolished, and instead biliary epithelial cells, {{commonly referred to as}} ductular oval cells, migrate into the periportal and midzonal parenchyma. Initially these cells behave as authentic biliary epithelium with expression of the biliary cytokeratin intermediate filaments, but then show hepatocytic traits such as alpha fetoprotein and albumin synthesis. Thereafter these biliary ducts rapidly vanish to be replaced by either small hepatocytes or intestinal-type cells. The proliferation and differentiation of oval cells is probably strongly influenced by paracrine signalling from liver stellate cells. Oval cells appear to be the progeny of facultative pluripotential stem cells which have the lineage potential of uncommitted gastrointestinal stem cells; these stem cells are likely to be located in the cholangioles and small interlobular bile ducts.

40|$|The {{inflammatory}} events {{induced by}} BaP 1, a 22. 7 kDa metalloproteinase isolated from Bothrops asper snake venom, were studied. BaP 1 i. p. injection in mice induced a marked inflammatory cell infiltrate into peritoneal cavity of animals with predominance of neutrophils {{in the early}} phase followed by mononuclear cells in the late period. Inhibition of enzymatic activity of BaP 1 by chelation with EDTA resulted in a drastic reduction of this effect. In addition, BaP 1 induced a significant increase of blood neutrophil numbers before its accumulation in peritoneal cavity, thus suggesting a stimulatory action of BaP 1 on mechanisms of cell mobilization from bone marrow <b>reserve</b> <b>compartments.</b> A {{reduction in the number}} of neutrophils was observed in the exudate when antibodies against LECAM- 1, CD 18 and LFA- 1 were used, suggesting the involvement of these adhesion molecules in the effects of BaP 1. In contrast, there was no effect with antibodies against ICAM- 1 and PECAM- 1. Moreover, a conspicuous increment in the levels of IL- 1 and TNF-alpha, but not of LTB 4, was observed in peritoneal washes collected from mice injected with BaP 1. It is concluded that BaP 1 induces in vivo a marked leukocyte influx, which parallels an increased number of these cells in the blood, and is associated to the expression of specific leukocyte adhesion molecules and release of chemotactic inflammatory cytokines. Since BaP 1 is a P-I class metalloproteinase, these results indicate that the proteolytic domain of metalloproteinases per se can trigger specific inflammatory events.

40|$|When {{the current}} level of {{carbohydrates}} produced by photosynthesis is not enough to meet the C demand for maintenance, growth or metabolism, trees use stored carbohydrates. In rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.), however, a previous study (Silpi U., A. Lacointe, P. Kasemsap, S. Thanisawanyangkura, P. Chantuma, E. Gohet, N. Musigamart, A. Clement, T. Ameglio and P. Thaler. 2007. Carbohydrate reserves as a competing sink: evidence from tapping the rubber tree. Tree Physiol. 27 : 881 - 889) showed that the additional sink created by latex tapping results not in a decrease, but in an increase in the non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) storage in trunk wood. In this study, the response of NSC storage to latex tapping was further investigated to better understand the trade-off between latex regeneration, biomass and storage. Three tapping systems were compared to the untapped Control for 2 years. Soluble sugars and starch were analyzed in bark and wood {{on both sides of the}} trunk, from 50 to 200 cm from the ground. The results confirmed over the 2 years that tapped trees stored more NSC, mainly starch, than untapped Control. Moreover, a double cut alternative tapping system, which produced a higher latex yield than conventional systems, led to even higher NSC concentrations. In all tapped trees, the increase in storage occurred together with a reduction in trunk radial growth. This was interpreted as a shift in carbon allocation toward the creation of reserves, at the expense of growth, to cover the increased risk induced by tapping (repeated wounding and loss of C in latex). Starch was lower in bark than in wood, whereas it was the contrary for soluble sugars. The resulting NSC was twice as low and less variable in bark than in wood. Although latex regeneration occurs in the bark, changes related to latex tapping were more marked in wood than in bark. From seasonal dynamics and differences between the two sides of the trunk in response to tapping, we concluded that starch in wood behaved as the long-term <b>reserve</b> <b>compartment</b> at the whole trunk level, whereas starch in bark was a local buffer. Soluble sugars behaved like an intermediate, ready-to-use compartment in both wood and bark. Finally, the dynamics of carbohydrate reserves appears a relevant parameter to assess the long-term performance of latex tapping systems...|$|R

40|$|Este estudo teve por objetivos: a) caracterizar o influxo de leucócitos (LC) induzido pelo veneno de Bothrops moojeni (VBm); b) avaliar o papel dos mastócitos (MC) e da histamina neste evento; c) analisar a liberação de TXA 2, PGD 2, LTB 4, MCP- 1 e KC e d) avaliar a capacidade do VBm desgranular MC in vivo e in vitro. A injeção {{intraperitoneal}} de VBm, em camundongos, causou o recrutamento de LC e neutrofilia. O tratamento dos animais com cromoglicato aboliu o influxo de LC enquanto a difenidramina, ranitidina e a tioperamida, antagonistas da histamina, reduziram o influxo de neutrófilos. Ainda, o veneno induziu a liberação de PGD 2, TXA 2, LTB 4, MCP- 1 e de KC e causou a desgranulação de MC in vivo e a liberação de -hexosaminidase de MC in vitro. Em conclusão, o VBm induz influxo de LC para o local de sua injeção. Este efeito depende da histamina, via receptores H 1, H 2 e H 4 e da desgranulação de MC, que decorre de ação direta do veneno nestas células. A neutrofilia e o TXA 2, LTB 4, MCP- 1 e KC devem contribuir para o influxo de leucócitos causado pelo VBm. In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} Bothrops moojeni venom (BmV) on the cellular component of inflammatory responses and the mechanisms involved in this effect were investigated. The effects of venom on peritoneal and circulating leukocyte numbers and on the release of inflammatory mediators, such as LTB 4, TXA 2, PGD 2, MIP- 1 and KC, were assessed. The role of both mast cells and histamine receptors in leukocyte recruitment induced by BmV was assessed by selected pharmacological treatments. BmV caused a marked infiltration of leukocytes (3 - 24 h) when injected into the peritoneal cavity of mice. Neutrophils (PMN) were the predominant cell type {{in the early stages of}} response whereas macrophages (MN) were accumulated from 3 up to 24 h. Moreover, BmV increased blood neutrophil numbers at 3 h after injection. The BmV-induced leukocyte influx was abrogated by cromoglicate and significantly reduced either by difenidramine or ranitidine or tioperamide, histamine H 1, H 2 and H 4 receptor antagonists, respectively, at 6 h after injection. Significant increments in peritoneal levels of LTB 4, TXA 2, PGD 2, MIP- 1 and KC were detected at distinct periods of time after venom injection. In addition, BmV induced mast cell degranulation both in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, obtained data demonstrated the ability of BmV induce leukocyte recruitment into the site of its injection. This effect is dependent on mast cell activation and degranulation, which may be due to a direct effect of venom on these cells, and is mediated at least in part by histamine via H 1, H 2 and H 4 receptors. Moreover, the ability of venom to mobilize leukocytes from bone marrow <b>reserve</b> <b>compartments</b> and to release the chemotactic mediators TXA 2, LTB 4, MCP- 1 and KC may be relevant for leukocyte infiltration...|$|R

In fact, nest entrances and brood cell linings are both impregnated with secretions from the Dufour's gland of the bees, which plays a role in nest orientation. Nests are dug into hard, compact soil and can be sealed from within by the queen using her abdomen. Because nests are dug into hard soil, construction of a nest represents a significant energy expense to a queen, which explains why gynes frequently usurp other nests rather than founding one of their own.

Houve diferença estatisticamente significante entre os volumes retidos das duas marcas para as agulhas de 26, 22 (30 x 0, 7 mm) e 18 G com p = 0, 01, p PURPOSE: To assess {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} intravitreal drug administration {{in the treatment of}} endophthalmitis and to suggest a reproducible and accessible technique for this procedure. METHODS: To assess the retained volumes in needles used for the intravitreal injection of antibiotics using an analytical scale. RESULTS: Means and standard deviations of retained volumes in the 26, 22 (25 x 0. 7 mm and 30 x 0. 7 mm) and 18 G were respectively 0. 051 ± 0. 006, 0. 056 ± 0. 005, 0. 055 ± 0. 004 and 0. 075 ± 0. 004 for needles Ryncos® and 0. 050 ± 0. 003, 0. 056 ± 0. 002, 0. 063 ± 0. 002 and 0. 084 ± 0. 004 for Becton-Dickinson®. There were statistically significant differences in the retained volumes between the two needle brands for 26, 22 (30 x 0. 7 mm) and 18 G needles with p = 0. 01, p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 01 respectively. No difference was found only for 25 x 0. 7 mm 22 G needle with p = 0. 83. CONCLUSION: Most needles used for intravitreal injection hold a retained volume in the <b>reserve</b> needle <b>compartment</b> that should be considered during the injection technique, therefore minimizing errors during intravitreal injection of antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} episodic occurrence of dissolved organic carbon(DOC) in the natural environment, bacterial degradation of labile DOC was studied under laboratory-controlled conditions followed by modelling. A single labile DOC compound was periodically added to the experimental culture and its degradation by a monospecific marine bacterial strain was followed. The measured variables were DOC and bacterial biomass determined from the particulate organic carbon values. Experimental dynamics showed a repetition of 2 successive patterns after each DOC pulse:(1) substrate consumption and bacterial growth {{in the first few}} hours after substrate addition, followed by(2) bacterial reduction(organic carbon-related) and associated non-labile DOC release within the next few hours. Based on these experimental results, the Dynamic Energy Budget theory was applied {{for the first time to}} such conditions to develop a mechanistic model that comprised 7 parameters and 4 state variables in which bacterial biomass was fractionated into <b>reserve</b> and structure <b>compartments.</b> The model was constructed by accounting for a constant specific maintenance rate and comprised 2 different cell maintenance fluxes, one fuelled from cell reserves when substrate was abundant and one from reserves and cell structures when starvation occurred. This new model of bacterial degradation adequately matched experimental measurements and accurately reproduced the accumulation of non-labile DOC in the culture during the experiment. This model can easily be implemented in an aquatic biogeochemical model and could provide better understanding of the role of bacteria in carbon cycling in fluctuating environments. © Inter-Research 2009...|$|R
