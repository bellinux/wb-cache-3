The famous elephant graveyards are false, but these animals have recognized a carcass of their species {{when they found}} one during their trips, {{and even if it}} was a stranger, they formed around it, and sometimes they even touched its forehead with their trunks.|$|R
40|$|Beef cow {{managers}} annually face <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> which {{animals to}} cull from <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> and replace. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this decision affect not only current revenues, but, by altering <b>the</b> genetic composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd,</b> also affect <b>the</b> future profitability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd.</b> These genetic changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> may, therefore, be {{represented as a}} form of endogenous technological progress to the cow calf producer. This article derives general asset replacement criteria for assets undergoing either exogenous or endogenous progress and illustrates their application with a Florida cow herd example.

Enraged and believing Patchi to be usurping him and also trying to take Juniper from him, Scowler goads Patchi into a battle for leadership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd.</b> Scowler quickly wins and disowns Patchi, ordering Juniper and <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> to leave him behind.

50|$|The same {{disparity}} is seen regarding {{inheritance of}} movable property. Most nomadic peoples from Asia, {{for example the}} Khalka Mongols, give {{a more or less}} equal share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> to each son as he marries. Typically the youngest remain behind caring for the parents and inheriting his father's tent after their death in addition to his own share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd.</b> However, others, such as the Yukaghir and the Yakuts, leave most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> to one son (in the above examples the youngest and the eldest, respectively). Some pastoral peoples from other geographical areas also practice unequal wealth transfers, although customs of equal male inheritance are more common among them than among agriculturalists.|$|R
