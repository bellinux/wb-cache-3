Any memory however, is doomed to loose its content as time proceeds if no action is taken. In order to avoid memory loss, a <b>refresh</b> <b>procedure</b> is periodically performed with time interval t_R. In this paper we show that it does exist a fundamental bound to the minimum energy required to preserve one bit of information for a time t̅, with probability of error less than P_E, and that this energy is a monotonically decreasing function of t_R. Two main conclusions are drawn: {{the good news is}} that, in principle, the cost of remembering can be arbitrarily reduced if the <b>refresh</b> <b>procedure</b> is performed often enough.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} for the commercialization of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is the limited lifetime due to degradation processes of the different fuel cell components. The investigation of the underlying degradation mechanisms and mitigation strategies for fuel cell operation and for material development are key factors for PEMFC research and development. This presentation is focused on reversible and irreversible degradation phenomena in PEMFCs. A new systematic approach {{for the analysis of}} reversible and irreversible degradation rates in an operating fuel cell will be introduced. A detailed description of voltage loss rates and particularly of the discrimination between reversible and irreversible voltage losses will be given. A major motivation of the presented work is the lack of common testing procedures and determination approaches of voltage losses in durability tests of fuel cell. This issue results in severe difficulties in the comparison of results obtained by different testing facilities. This is limiting factor for the development of fuel cell components because the results within different research projects cannot be correlated, especially if only one value for a degradation rate is reported, e. g. for defined current density and defined test operating conditions.

40|$|This paper proposes {{an error}} {{resilient}} coding scheme that employs distributed video coding tools. A bitstream, produced {{by any standard}} motion-compensated predictive codec (MPEG-x, H. 26 x), is sent over an error-prone channel. In addition, a Wyner–Ziv encoded auxiliary bitstream is sent as redundant information {{to serve as a}} forward error correction code. At the decoder side, error concealed reconstructed frames are used as side information by the Wyner–Ziv decoder, and the corrected frame is used as a reference by future frames, thus reducing drift. We explicitly target the problem of rate allocation at the encoder side, by estimating the channel induced distortion in the transform domain. Rate adaptivity is achieved at the frame, subband and bitplane granularity. Experimental results conducted over a simulated error-prone channel reveal that the proposed scheme has comparable or better performance than a scheme where forward error correction codes are used.

40|$|Our {{presentation}} {{focuses on}} durability testing and degradation of fuel cells. A major motivation {{of our work}} {{is the lack of}} common description procedures and determination approaches of voltage losses in durability tests of fuel cell for both stationary and automotive applications; this issue leads to severe difficulties in the comparison of results obtained by different institutions or within different projects, especially if only a single value for the degradation rate is reported. In this context, special attention is devoted to the discrimination between so called reversible and irreversible voltage losses. The first are permanent and determine the maximum lifetime of a fuel cell. The latter strongly depend on the chosen operation conditions and can be recovered by specific procedures. In order so systematically address voltage losses we have performed single cell durability measurements of several hundreds of hours in 25 cm 2 lab-scale cells using different test protocols containing regular refresh procedures (soak time) allowing to distinguish between reversible and irreversible losses. Furthermore, operation strategies to minimize reversible degradation without using the time consuming refresh procedures are provided. To test the refresh procedures and analyze their effect on cell performance, parameters such as duration of the soak time steps have been varied. Between these refresh steps the cells were typically operated for 50 to 150 h. As samples conventional 5 -layer membrane electrode assemblies were used with PFSA membranes, Pt-based catalysts and hydrophobized carbon fiber substrates with micro porous layers as GDLs. For in-situ diagnosis of the operated cells polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectra, and cyclic voltammograms were recorded {{in order to determine the}} impact of the operation conditions and the refresh procedures on degradation. The interpretation of the degradation of the measured membrane electrode assemblies is supported by post-mortem analysis using physical characterization techniques. Additionally, we provide possible approaches to quantitatively determine irreversible voltage decay rates. For instance, voltage values before or after voltage recovery steps can be used to calculate the irreversible loss rate. The advantages and drawbacks of different approaches are discussed. One clear conclusion is that short time tests in the range of 100 hour are not conclusive since this time is too short to make a reliable discrimination between reversible and irreversible losses; also, the decay rate of reversible loss observed after each refresh step increases substantially upon long time operation independent on the type of the <b>refresh</b> <b>procedure.</b> In summary, in our presentation strategies for determination of fuel cell voltages loss rates are compared, evaluated and assessed according to their suitability to distinguish between reversible and irreversible degradation rates; a description of voltage loss rates is proposed.

By using the 4 BMBP/Au, the luminescence intensity increased by about 27 % compared to that of a bare gold electrode (bare Au). Moreover, the modified electrode improved the time required for analysis because the modified layer prevented BL adsorption. Even without a <b>refreshing</b> <b>procedure</b> for each measurement, a constant luminescence intensity could be observed, and the analysis time was reduced to half (about 10 min) for one sample.

40|$|To {{meet the}} {{requirements}} of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEMFCs) for automotive applications a durability of 5, 000 h, corresponding to a degradation rate of 10 μV/h, and a high power density of 1 W/cm 2 at 670 mV cell voltage are required. It is of great importance for the stack durability validation in PEMFC stacks to assure that results from different institutions are comparable. Therefore, the harmonization of PEMFC test procedures is of significant interest for industry and academia and important to fuel cell development. The preparation of required protocols for stack durability in automotive application was realized in the FCH JU project Stack-Test. The crucial parameters for reliable validation were identified and the fuel cell dynamic load cycle, based on the new European driving cycle, was specified considering the feedback from industrial institutions, from OEMs to stack manufacturers, and academia. Beside the load cycle, the importance of reproducible shut-down, <b>refresh</b> and restart <b>procedures</b> was demonstrated. The aspect of <b>refresh</b> <b>procedures</b> was analyzed in the FCH JU IMPACT project in detail to discriminate between reversible and irreversible degradation in order to propose a reliable and general procedure to quantitatively assess durability achievements for automotive PEMFC MEAs and stacks. To make the PEMFC competitive for automotive application, the IMPACT project was focused on the reduction of the Pt amount to 0. 2 mgPt/cm 2. The reduction of Pt loading leads to substantial performance losses and an increased degradation. To mitigate these issues and to maintain high performance and durability at low Pt loadings, in IMPACT the MEA core components, namely the membrane and the catalyst layer, have been improved. In the course of the project several generations of MEAs have been developed iteratively and tested in single cells and stacks. Thanks to this effort the irreversible degradation rate of a MEA with 0. 21 mgPt/cm 2 measured at 1 A/cm 2 could be reduced by a factor > 10 down to approximately 10 μV/h. The performance achieved by IMPACT at 0. 25 mgPt/cm 2 corresponds to the one of a commercial state-of-the-art MEA with 0. 6 mgPt/cm 2.

30|$|In fact, {{as shown}} in Figures 4 and 5, the {{announcement}} multicast session and the data multicast session are both joined and <b>refreshed</b> by similar <b>procedures,</b> which start with an IGMP message. Thus, each time they are performed, they produce {{the same amount of}} overhead on the wireless interface, even if membership refresh requires a lower number of signaling messages for the signaling server. Given the greater importance of data sessions queries than announcement ones,a two different IGMP query periods can be used in the ASN-GW, IGMPT 1, and IGMPT 2, which represent the refresh period of both the data and the announcement multicast sessions, respectively. Their values used in subsequent calculations are reported in Table 1. We have used a value for IGMPT 2 10 times larger than the value of IGMPT 1. These values can be adjusted for different multicast groups in the ASN-GW configuration, and the overhead rate can therefore be optimized.|$|R

The slices were decalcified in EDTA, dehydrated with alcohol and xylol, embedded in paraffin and cut into 4  μm-thick histological sections. Histological analyses were performed on Movat Pentachrome stained sections, which allowed a distinct and colorful contrast between the different tissue types: fibrin is stained in different shades of red, cartilage is stained deep green, fibrous connective tissue is stained in light green-blue and bony tissue is stained in yellow.

40|$|Over {{a number}} of years, {{research}} released {{through a series of}} publications known as the Manuali del recupero (“Restoration Manuals”, for Rome 1989, 1997; Città di Castello 1990, 1992, Palermo 1997), together with other parallel initiatives, has presented an integrated vision of the arts of pre-modern construction. Just slightly more than 20 years ago, pre-modern building materials seemed untrustworthy to conservation and restoration professionals. The technology linked to these materials and the historic construction values themselves were perceived as a dying culture, unsuited not only to keeping pace with modern technological performance, but also inadvisable for conservation and restoration operations for historic built heritage. By bringing materials, techniques and composite models of pre-modern construction to the forefront, the Restoration Manuals offered architectural conservation practitioners and restoration planners new instruments of awareness and <b>procedures,</b> <b>refreshing</b> an otherwise stagnant situation. It is now true that the application of traditional worksite techniques, which only a few decades ago would have seemed a traditionalist utopia, is an expanding reality. Traditional techniques are not only applied by a few “enlightened” administrations, but are also rooted in the building industry, driven by a small but significant niche demand. A renaissance is under way in production and installation of pre-modern finishes and, unlike not long ago, it is now not difficult to organise a worksite that can furnish materials and produce decent work in stone, brick, plaster, wood and traditional finishes. It falls to the university system to take the guiding role in forming the next generation of professionals, soon to arrive on the market, by creating awareness of conservation and restoration planning models that respect pre-modern construction. The core of the problem is training those who contribute to the success of a restoration project and building site, a problem whose solution has been much discussed (and less implemented). As an illustration of student experience, we would like to present and highlight several bachelors’ theses dealing with segments of built heritage in the historic centre of the capital city and small towns in the Italian countryside.
