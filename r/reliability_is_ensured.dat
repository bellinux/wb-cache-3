30|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is to investigate the problem of URLLC in fog networks with proactive edge caching of computing results. <b>Reliability</b> <b>is</b> <b>ensured</b> by allowing UNs to offload their computing tasks to multiple edge computing nodes (cloudlets) based on the notion of hedged requests [24]. Furthermore, both computing and storage resources are exploited to minimize the computing latency via joint task offloading and proactive caching of popular and cacheable computing tasks. In the proposed framework, UNs and their serving cloudlets are grouped into well-chosen clusters based on spatial proximity and mutual interests in popular tasks. This allows cloudlets to proactively cache computing results of popular tasks in their clusters to ensure minimal computing latency. Moreover, the problem of task distribution to cloudlets is modeled as a matching game between cloudlets and UNs. To this end, an efficient distributed matching algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of distributing UN requests to cloudlets, reaching a stable matching such that a reliable service in terms of maximum latency violation rate is guaranteed. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can guarantee reliable computations with bounded latency in different network density and storage capability conditions. Proactiveness is shown to minimize up to 50 % and 65 % of the average and the 99 th percentile delay, respectively. Moreover, hedged requests are shown to significantly improve the system reliability even without proactive capability.|$|E

Reliability is the key issue raised due to complex nature of network and growth of computer science. In this paper we have devised a technique for file transfer which identifies whether some portion of the file is received corrupt or not, and if yes then exactly what portion is corrupt. This technique provides reliability by eliminating the corruption from a file, hence requiring less bandwidth of the network by reducing the amount of data to be re-sent in case of corruption. The <b>reliability</b> <b>is</b> <b>ensured</b> with the help of file signature generation method which we have devised in this paper. The beauty of this technique that it generates hashes which are not easy to break, hence ensuring security of the file. We have used TCP as the underlying protocol, whereas TCP is already considered to be reliable, {{but the fact is that}} it does not ensure the reliable transfer over the network due to the fact that it uses CRC which is still vulnerable to network conditions and malicious attacks. Our technique operates at the application layer and tries to finish the cope up with the reliability over the file transfer. We have also developed a prototype to test the integrity of our technique. Empirical results ensure the reliability of our technique. The emphasis of this paper is to provide users with the corrupt free file transfer over the network, so that their time and valuable resources might be saved I...|$|E
40|$|Low Dropout Regulators (LDRs) are {{commonly}} used in high performance applications due to their low noise, fast transient response characteristics. In LDR design, frequency response {{is the most important}} issue in the regulator performance. With conventional LDR, the bandwidth varies with load current. Thus, the regulator cannot satisfy the speed specification for wide load current range. Besides, due to the compensation characteristics, this design is unreliable and imprecise for high performance application. In this thesis, a new pole-zero tracking frequency compensation is proposed. A tracking zero is generated to cancel out the load current dependent pole. A low frequency dominant pole is also introduced to boost up the DC gain. With this compensation scheme, the frequency response becomes load current independent and the performance can be optimized for wide load current range. The precision is much higher due to the large DC loop gain. <b>Reliability</b> <b>is</b> <b>ensured</b> since the compensation only depends on well-controlled parameters and the ratio of the same component. A LDR using the proposed frequency compensation scheme is designed using a 0. 35 μm CMOS process. Load current varies from 0 μA to 100 mA. Simulation results show that the proposed design features a bandwidth variation of 2. 5 times as opposed to over 10, 000 times in conventional design. The 96 dB minimum DC loop gain leads to an excellent line and load regulations of 0. 67 mV/V and - 0. 43 μV/mA, respectively. Finally, a low power version of the proposed LDR compensation scheme is designed and fabricated. The bandwidth variation is 2. 3 times and the minimum DC gain is 72 dB.

The effects are examined for Ghana and Vietnam, which have recently become attractive outsourcing locations. They are compared with China and India, both well known for their outsourcing sectors and their attractiveness as outsourcing locations.   Design/methodology/approach – In this research paper an exploratory method is applied. During the examination economic data provided by supranational organizations is used to measure the effects of outsourcing. Data is collected to match the requirements of the applied triangular model for measuring. Background for the data collection is the triangular model by Granger. Key figures for observation are Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), exports, and their correlations. Validity and <b>reliability</b> <b>is</b> <b>ensured</b> through cross examination of the model.   Findings – The effects of outsourcing vary a lot. All key figures rose in general during the observed 30 years, from 1981 till 2010. The correlations show that there are eventual relations of the figures, although direct relations each by each year are not found. The most remarkable finding is that FDI might indeed push the exports. Export rates are rising in the years after the investment is done. The relation of FDI and GDP show that there can be interrelations as well, but if the GDP is increased in higher rates than the FDI is done. An overall result of the examination is that Vietnam seems to rely heavily on outsourcing as they export almost ¾ of the fabrications whereas it is assumed that Ghana tries more on development and improvement of the whole economy.   Originality/value – This research paper looks at the often discussed phenomenon outsourcing by focussing on its economic effects by focussing on the effects for the developing countries Vietnam and Ghana.

The tools for collecting information was a multi sectional questionnaire consisting of demographic information, measurement of urinary system health behavior, knowledge and health belief model constructs, which its validity and <b>reliability</b> <b>were</b> <b>ensured</b> previously. Data analysis was performed with SPSS version 20 by using correlation coefficient and linear regression tests. Results: The mean age of subjects 27 / 4 ± 4 / 4 years. The relationship between demographic variables and health behavior wasn’t found. The most people (179 equivalents to 71 / 6 %) had medium level of knowledge about urinary tract infection, and only 44 women (17. 6 %) had appropriate awareness. Mean score of preventive behaviors was significant difference between different levels of knowledge (p = 0 / 026), self efficacy (p= 0 / 000) and perceived barriers (p= 0 / 002). In multivariate ANOVA, only the self efficacy had strong positive relationship with the preventing behaviors of urinary tract infection (p= 0 / 000). Conclusion: Based on these results, the necessity of education based on health belief model with an emphasis on increasing the efficacy is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Resting {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} (RSBP) and postural control are two measures commonly assessed using an automatic digital blood pressure monitor and for assessing centre of pressure (COP) measures using a force platform respectively. Measuring <b>reliability</b> <b>is</b> essential to <b>ensure</b> that differences observed in either RSBP or COP reflect a true change in inter-session (between-session) variability rather than systematic or random error. The purpose of the two pilot studies was to (1) determine inter-session reliability and (2) establish a repeatable protocol to assess RSBP and COP measures in young adults...|$|R
