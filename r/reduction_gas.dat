5000|$|In the Reduction shaft {{the iron}} ore, along with {{limestone}} and dolomite additives, is added and then reduced by <b>reduction</b> <b>gas</b> into 95% direct reduced iron, DRI. The DRI is then redirected via six discharge screws into the melter-gasifier. The Melter gasifier has three main sections, the gaseous free board zone, the Char bed, and the hearth zone, {{and it has}} an effect on several stages in the process. First it serves to create the <b>reduction</b> <b>gas</b> by gasifying the coal with oxygen and then cooling it. After being reduced, the DRI is redirected to the char bed where the iron and slag are melted and then directed to the hearth zone. [...] The heat inside the metal gasifier keeps the amount of phenols small, keeping them out of the atmosphere. Meanwhile, carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas from the original gasification of the coal exit the gasifier while other byproducts are captured in the metallic slag. The rest of the hot gas is then cooled and sent into the reduction shaft resulting in the Corex export gas which is used to control pressure in the plant. Many of the gases resulting from this process can then be recycled or used to produce electricity. [...] Dust particles also appear in these gases and the Melter gasifier recycles them with four dust burners.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBiomass {{can deliver}} {{significant}} greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>reductions</b> in electricity, heat and transport fuel supply. However, our biomass resource is limited {{and should be}} used to deliver the most strategic and significant impacts. The relative greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>reduction</b> merits of different bioenergy systems (for electricity, heat, chemical and biochar production) were examined on a common, scientific basis using consistent life cycle assessment methodology, scope of system and assumptions. The results show that bioenergy delivers substantial and cost-effective greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>reductions.</b> Large scale electricity systems deliver the largest absolute <b>reductions</b> in greenhouse <b>gases</b> per unit of energy generated, while medium scale wood chip district heating boilers result in the highest level of greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>reductions</b> per unit of harvested biomass. However, ammonia and biochar systems deliver the most cost effective carbon reductions, while biochar systems potentially deliver the highest greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>reductions</b> per unit area of land. The system that achieves the largest <b>reduction</b> in greenhouse <b>gases</b> per unit of energy does not also deliver the highest greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>reduction</b> per unit of biomass. So policy mechanisms that incentivize the reductions in the carbon intensity of energy may not result in the best use of the available resource.

40|$|Abstract. The {{popularity}} of wind energy is increasing and that arises several technical problems like system stability and wind power reliability. Power companies {{have learned how}} to predict power consumption and therefore know how to plan power generation. Adding notable amount of wind power into the system requires a new approach to system stability. The idea of wind power is to reduce the domination of fossil fuel and to decrease emissions. This issue is very important in Estonia, where mainly thermal power plants are used for power production. In this paper cooperation between wind turbines and a conventional power plant is analysed. As the result of this analysis, the supplementary emission caused by using conventional power plants for balancing wind turbines is calculated.

The RGD is considerably more sensitive to alkenes than is the flame ionization detector. The detection limit of this present GC/RGD system for alkenes is about 0. 01 ng. It has much greater sensitivity to alkenes than to alkanes. Its sensitivity increases with increasing HgO bed temperature, but its selectivity towards alkenes decreases at the same time. The selectivity of the RGD may not be significant for much heavier molecules. The sensitivity of the RGD is inversely proportional to the carrier gas flow rate through the HgO bed. The baseline of the system increases significantly with increasing oven temperature...|$|E

These results suggest that the first pure H 2 /H 2 O reduction reduce more cobalt oxide into cobalt metal with bigger particle size, and the followed oxidation, then 5  %H 2 /Ar reduction may further reduce the particle size, which becomes easier to be oxidized.

To study this, samples of three ore types from the Northern Cape iron ore field in South Africa, and one blended ore from this region, were studied. The methods were high temperature microscopy (during reduction) and quantification of fines formation following reduction disintegration tests.
