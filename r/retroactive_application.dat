25|$|In 1993, then prime {{minister}} Brian Mulroney {{made an offer}} of individual medallions, a museum wing, and other collective measures involving several other redress-seeking communities. These were rejected outright by the Chinese Canadian national groups. After Jean Chrétien, in the same year, replaced Mulroney as {{prime minister}}, the Cabinet openly refused to provide an apology or redress. Still, the CCNC and its supporters continued to raise the issue whenever they could, including a submission to the United Nations Human Rights Commission and eventually undertaking court action against the Crown-in-Council, arguing that the federal Crown should not be profiting from racism {{and that it had}} a responsibility under both the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and international human rights law. In addition, the 1988 apology and compensation for the internment of Japanese Canadians during the Second World War was regarded as a precedent for redressing other racially motivated policies. The Ontario court declared in 2001 that the government of Canada had no obligation to redress the head tax levied on Chinese immigrants because the Charter had no <b>retroactive</b> <b>application</b> and the case of internment of Japanese Canadians was not a legal precedent. Two appeals in 2002 and 2003 were unsuccessful.|$|E

50|$|At a {{very basic}} level, the Gateway {{investigation}} provided important insights for U.S. companies about the FTC's position on privacy policy violations, particularly violations pertaining to the disclosure of customer information. Had there been any doubt, the Gateway case announced that the FTC viewed consumer privacy protection {{as part of its}} mandate. The FTC made clear that companies were, in fact, bound by the terms they expressed in their privacy policies, and that <b>retroactive</b> <b>applications</b> of new privacy policies, without proper notification, would be considered an inherently unfair act.|$|R
40|$|In his article, Professor Krieger {{discusses}} the inconsistent and contradictory {{application of the}} traditional rule against retroactive ratemaking. The author notes that while many courts adhere to the rule at least rhetorically, they tend to either ignore the literal terms of the rule or to create ad hoc exceptions to it; simultaneously, other courts continue to apply the rule inflexibly. As a result, courts provide little guidance to litigants and their attorneys on the general application of the rule. To remedy the inconsistent application of the traditional rule, Professor Krieger suggests a new formulation of the rule that creates only a presumption against retroactivity. The commission, faced with a retroactivity determination, would engage in an analysis {{to determine whether the}} claimant had a reasonable reliance on the prior rate and whether <b>retroactive</b> rate <b>application</b> would produce efficiency incentives or disincentives...|$|R
40|$|Meltwater {{runoff from}} the Greenland ice sheet surface {{influences}} surface mass balance (SMB), ice dynamics, and global sea level rise, but is estimated with climate models and thus difficult to validate. We present {{a way to}} measure ice surface runoff directly, from hourly in situ supraglacial river discharge measurements and simultaneous high-resolution satellite/drone remote sensing of upstream fluvial catchment area. A first 72 -h trial for a 63. 1 -km 2 moulin-terminating internally drained catchment (IDC) on Greenland?s midelevation (1, 207 ? 1, 381 m above sea level) ablation zone is compared with melt and runoff simulations from HIRHAM 5, MAR 3. 6, RACMO 2. 3, MERRA- 2, and SEB climate/SMB models. Current models cannot reproduce peak discharges or timing of runoff entering moulins but are improved using synthetic unit hydrograph (SUH) theory. <b>Retroactive</b> SUH <b>applications</b> to two older field studies reproduce their findings, signifying that remotely sensed IDC area, shape, and supraglacial river length are useful for predicting delays in peak runoff delivery to moulins. Applying SUH to HIRHAM 5, MAR 3. 6, and RACMO 2. 3 gridded melt products for 799 surrounding IDCs suggests their terminal moulins receive lower peak discharges, less diurnal variability, and asynchronous runoff timing relative to climate/SMB model output alone. Conversely, large IDCs produce high moulin discharges, even at high elevations where melt rates are low. During this particular field experiment, models overestimated runoff by + 21 to + 58 %, linked to overestimated surface ablation and possible meltwater retention in bare, porous, low-density ice. Direct measurements of ice surface runoff will improve climate/SMB models, and incorporating remotely sensed IDCs will aid coupling of SMB with ice dynamics and subglacial systemspublishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
