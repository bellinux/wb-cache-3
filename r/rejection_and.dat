5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1916 he was {{transferred}} as first lieutenant to a Q-ship under Gordon Campbell. A Q-ship was a merchant ship with hidden weaponry, commanded secretly by the navy and manned by a Royal Navy crew. When attacked by a submarine, the Q-ship would feign damage until the enemy {{was close enough to}} engage and then reveal its weapons to counter-attack. Campbell, a major proponent of Q-ship strategy, was impressed with Stuart's stubborn refusal to accept the two years of <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> brought him in to replace an officer whose nerves had cracked under the strain of Q-ship operations.|$|E

This initiative was mostly backed by rural (57.6% approvals) and suburban agglomerations (51.2% approvals), and isolated towns (51.3% approvals) of Switzerland {{as well as by}} a strong majority (69.2% approval) in the canton of Ticino, while metropolitan centres (58.5% <b>rejection)</b> <b>and</b> the French-speaking part (58.5% rejection) of Switzerland rather rejected it. Some news commentators claim that this proposal de facto contradicts the bilateral agreements on the free movement of persons from these respective countries.|$|E
5|$|SCI {{can lead}} to {{significant}} insecurities, which have repercussions for sexuality and self-image. SCI often affects body image, either due to the host {{of changes in the}} body that affect appearance (e.g. unused muscles in the legs become atrophied), or due to changes in self-perception not directly from physical changes. People frequently find themselves less attractive and expect others not to be attracted to them after SCI. These insecurities cause fear of <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> deter people from initiating contact or sexual activity or engaging in sex. Feelings of undesirability or worthlessness even lead some to suggest to their partners that they find someone able bodied.|$|E

By {{the time of his}} release and return to the United States in January 1919, Agnes and Hemingway had decided to marry within a few months in America. However, in March, she wrote that she had become engaged to an Italian officer.

5|$|Woodruff's {{contributions}} to surgery were important and long-lasting.

Although best known for these clinical accomplishments, Woodruff's {{contributions to}} the study of <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> tolerance induction were equally important. Among these contributions, Woodruff's work with anti-lymphocyte serum has led to its wide use to reduce rejection symptoms in organ transplant recipients up to the current day.|$|E
5|$|Before play begins, the Dungeon Master (or DM, {{the player}} who organizes and directs the game play) {{randomly}} draws five cards from a deck of six. Two of these cards determine the locations of two magical weapons useful in defeating Strahd: the Holy Symbol and the Sunsword. The next two cards determine the locations of Strahd and the Tome of Strahd, a book that details Strahd's long-ago unrequited love. In this work, it is revealed that Strahd {{had fallen in love}} with a young girl, who in turn loved his younger brother. Strahd blamed his age for the <b>rejection,</b> <b>and</b> made a pact with evil powers to live forever. He then slew his brother, but the young girl killed herself in response, and Strahd found that he had become a vampire. All six possible locations are inside Castle Ravenloft.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the relations between}} anxious attachment styles <b>and</b> <b>rejection</b> sensitivity, <b>and</b> the potential mediating role of self-esteem and worry. A sample of 125 Iranian college students completed surveys assessing rejection sensitivity, attachment style, worry and self-esteem. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analyses were conducted. Results {{show that there is}} a significant positive relationship between anxious attachment styles <b>and</b> <b>rejection</b> sensitivity. The study suggests that a higher score in anxious attachment styles is associated with a higher level of worry and lower level of self-esteem and it is also associated with higher level of rejection sensitivity. Furthermore, there is a positive significant relationship between worry <b>and</b> <b>rejection</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> there is a negative significant relationship between self-esteem <b>and</b> <b>rejection</b> sensitivity. Results indicate that self-esteem and worry mediate the relationship between anxious attachment styles <b>and</b> <b>rejection</b> sensitivity...|$|R

5|$|By late January 2006, campaigning {{was under}} way for the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election, 2006 {{scheduled}} to take place for the Westminster constituency in which {{the north end of}} the bridge is situated. The by-election, scheduled for 9 February, was contested by – in addition to the major political parties in Scotland – an Abolish Forth Bridge Tolls Party. It was won by Liberal Democrat candidate Willie Rennie, overturning a large Labour majority on a 16% swing. In the aftermath of the by-election defeat, media speculation suggested the Executive had turned against the proposals, and Tavish Scott eventually confirmed their <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> the retention of the existing toll structure on 1 March 2006. FETA condemned the decision, while local opposition MSPs charged the minister that his tolling review short-changed Fifers as tolls were axed on the Erskine Bridge leaving tolls on only the Forth and Tay Road Bridge.|$|E

The two of them begin to bond, and she agrees to give Sterling Cooper another shot. Meanwhile, Pete and some of his co-workers go to a gentlemen's club to celebrate Pete's impending wedding. There, a waitress rejects Pete's advances. Dejected from this <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> Don's recent criticisms, Pete arrives drunk at Peggy's apartment, and she invites him in. Don takes a train to a large house in the suburbs, where he is greeted by his loving wife Betty (January Jones), whom he has made no mention of thus far in the episode.

30|$|Rationale: In this {{research}} question, we focus our interest on understanding the how pull requests of {{internal and external}} are received. We focused on (i) acceptance <b>and</b> <b>rejection</b> rates <b>and</b> (ii) on the priority given to the pull requests. As the literature suggests, {{it is not always}} easy to contribute to open-source projects [8]. We, therefore, explore whether external developers are facing a harder time in terms of <b>rejections</b> <b>and</b> time to process when compared to their internal peers. If that is the case, answers to this question might help improve how company-owned OSS projects treat external developers.|$|R

40|$|Rejection {{sensitivity}} is {{a personality}} disposition characterized by oversensitivity to social rejection. Using a three-level meta-analytic model, 75 studies were reviewed that examined associations between <b>rejection</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> five mental health outcomes: depression, anxiety, loneliness, borderline personality disorder, and {{body dysmorphic disorder}}. The results showed significant and moderate associations between <b>rejection</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> depression (pooled r = 0. 332; p < 0. 001), anxiety (pooled r = 0. 407; p < 0. 001), loneliness (pooled r = 0. 386; p < 0. 001), borderline personality disorder (pooled r = 0. 413; p < 0. 001), and body dysmorphic disorder (pooled r = 0. 428; p < 0. 001). The associations between <b>rejection</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder varied by type of sample, but the associations were similar for clinical and non-clinical (i. e., community) samples. The association between <b>rejection</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> anxiety was negatively moderated by percentage of females in samples. The association between <b>rejection</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> depression was negatively moderated by length of follow-up. The longitudinal associations between <b>rejection</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> depression, anxiety, and loneliness were stable over time. Implications of the findings for both risk assessment and prevention and intervention strategies in mental health practice are discussed...|$|R
