5|$|The {{efficacy}} of chemical pesticides tends to diminish over time. This is because any organism that manages {{to survive the}} initial application will pass on its genes to its offspring and a <b>resistant</b> <b>strain</b> will be developed. In this way, {{some of the most}} serious pests have developed resistance and are no longer killed by pesticides that used to kill their ancestors. This necessitates higher concentrations of chemical, more frequent applications and a movement to more expensive formulations.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{resistance}} {{occurs when}} a person becomes infected with a <b>resistant</b> <b>strain</b> of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.|$|E

5|$|Using {{draconian}} drills {{that required}} officers to place atebrin tablets in their men's mouths, the army attempted {{to reduce the}} incidence of malaria to zero. For the most part they were successful but in the Aitape-Wewak campaign the 6th Division suffered an epidemic of malaria despite its best efforts. Fairley was urgently recalled from a tour of South East Asia Command and given orders by General Blamey to personally proceed to Wewak and investigate the situation. A special section was formed from the LHQ Medical Research Unit to assist the 6th Division and certain relapsing personnel were evacuated to Cairns. The epidemic was ultimately brought under control by doubling the dosage of atebrin. Fairley was forced to confront the fact—confirmed by research at Cairns—that an atebrin <b>resistant</b> <b>strain</b> of malaria had arisen. The ability of malaria to develop resistant strains would have profound implications in the post-war world.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim. Sometimes {{resistance}} of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Ps. aeruginosa) is developed during antibiotic treatment, {{in spite of}} the initial susceptibility in vitro. The aim {{of this study was to}} use an in vitro model for the study of the development of <b>resistant</b> <b>strains</b> of Ps. aeruginosa after a short exposure to ceftazidime, and to study the hydrolysing capacity of β-lactamases produced by the <b>resistant</b> <b>strains.</b> Methods. Among 563 clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa, 37 multisensitive strains were collected for the study. After being identified, strains with simultaneous sensitivity to 5 expanded spectrum cephalosporins were chosen. For each strain, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the 5 expanded spectrum cephalosporins was determined, and the production of extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) was excluded by the double-disc synergy diffusion test. Strains non producing ESBL were cultivated in concentrations of ceftazidime equal to MIC× 2 and MIC× 4. After 24 hours of culture, the development of <b>resistant</b> <b>strains</b> was estimated and the cephalosporinase activity of the produced β-lactamases was determined by their ability to hydrolyse cefazolin. Hydrolysis of cefazolin was studied by measuring the change of its absorbance on 272 nm using a Shimadzu 160 A spectrophotometer. The hydrolyzing capacity of the enzymes was expressed as the percentage of the antibiotic, which was hydrolysed in 10 sec. Results. A total of 60 % and 50 % of <b>strains</b> developed <b>resistant</b> <b>strains</b> after exposure to ceftazidime in concentration MIC× 2 and MIC× 4, respectively. The hydrolyzing capacity of the original strains was 15 - 36 % while the hydrolyzing capacity of the <b>resistant</b> <b>strains</b> was 10 - 73 %. Totally 64 % of the <b>resistant</b> <b>strains</b> expressed higher hydrolyzing capacity than the original strains. Conclusion. Regardless of the susceptibility test results, Ps. aeruginosa presented a high tendency to develop <b>resistant</b> <b>strains</b> after a short exposure to ceftazidime in vitro. In most cases the <b>resistant</b> <b>strains</b> expressed higher cephalosporinase activity than the original strains, suggesting derepression of chromosomal β-lactamases. Our model offers a simple, inexpensive and rapid method for detecting {{resistance of}} Ps. aeruginosa developed due to derepression of β-lactamases, and for discriminating <b>resistant</b> <b>strains</b> with derepressed β-lactamases from strains that developed other mechanisms of resistance...|$|R
