500|$|From {{retrospective}} reviews, The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music {{commented that}} Barely Real was [...] "on first hearing, slightly soporific and listless, but it rewards <b>repeated</b> <b>listening</b> with its depth and emotional texture." [...] Ned Raggett (AllMusic) gave the album {{a rating of}} {{four and a half}} stars out of five, explaining that [...] "Those put off by earlier Codeine CDs won't want to continue; those taken by the band's way of doing things will happily embrace it." [...] The Numero Group's reissue received positive reviews from Spin and Pitchfork Media, with Pitchfork declaring that after The Frigid Stars LP, the EP [...] "felt masterful in its compression of what we'd come to expect from them." ...|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Copeland stated his {{creative}} process for writing {{the music for}} the Spyro series always began by playing through the levels, {{trying to get a}} feel for each world's [...] "atmosphere". Copeland noted the challenge of writing for games was to create music that would both be interesting to listen to and complemented the gameplay; his approach was to incorporate more complicated harmonies and basslines so that the music could seem fresh for players, even after <b>repeated</b> <b>listening.</b> He complimented the compact disc format of the PlayStation and its support for high quality audio; there were no technical constraints that stopped him from producing the sound he wanted. Copeland recorded entire orchestral scores for extra flourish when the visuals called for an expansive sound, but used more percussive and beat-driven melodies for [...] "high-energy" [...] moments in the game.|$|E
2500|$|Cooper {{has served}} as a {{composer}} and arranger on more than 150 works since first writing music in the early 1980s, including solo instrumental pieces all the way through full symphonic works for orchestra and singers. His writing style has been described as [...] "propulsive and sassy on an initial listen, revealing subtle shadings and intricate nuances upon <b>repeated</b> <b>listening.</b> [...] I might have guessed Don Sebesky...on a blindfold test." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{sound is}} less {{accessible}} than Fates Warning's other works and many {{say that the}} album required <b>repeated</b> <b>listens</b> to sink in; critics and fans have often had mixed opinions as a result. Indeed, the album has often polarized fans.|$|R
5000|$|....Upon {{listening}} {{though the}} album, I was totally confused. I {{had nothing to}} compare it to. It was freakish. But after <b>repeated</b> <b>listens,</b> there was that eureka moment, and ever since then they {{have been on the}} loftiest of rock pedestals" ...|$|R
2500|$|DeRogatis {{compared}} the album's <b>repeated</b> <b>listening</b> value to a heightened psychedelic awareness, that its melodies [...] "continue to reveal themselves after dozens of listens, just as previously unnoticed {{corners of the}} world reveal themselves during the psychedelic experience". On the subject of psychedelic records in the 1960s, Sean Lennon stated that [...] "psychedelic music is a term that pretty much refers to these sort of epic, ambitious long-form records... the reason Pet Sounds is considered a psychedelic journey or whatever is because it's like opening a door and stepping through and entering another world and you're in that other world {{for a period of time}} and then you come back." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} critics singled out the song as a {{highlight}} of the album. Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Both 'Can't Stop Thinking About You' and 'Tired of Midnight Blue'... are well done. Free from dogma... they provide the most effective nine minutes of music Harrison's made since his solo career began." [...] Ray Coleman of Melody Maker admired Keltner's drumming and the lead vocal part, which he said demonstrated [...] "a texture to George's voice which hasn't often been heard". Coleman said {{that each of the}} album's tracks could [...] "stand alone as a single" [...] and identified [...] "Can't Stop Thinking About You" [...] as a [...] "goodie" [...] that improved through <b>repeated</b> <b>listening.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Steely Dan's lyrical {{subjects}} are diverse, {{but in their}} basic approach they often create fictional personae that participate in a narrative or situation. The duo have said that in retrospect, most of their albums have a 'feel' of either Los Angeles or New York City, the two main cities where Becker and Fagen lived and worked. Characters appear in their songs that evoke these cities. Steely Dan's lyrics are often puzzling to the listener, with {{the true meaning of}} the song [...] "uncoded" [...] through <b>repeated</b> <b>listening,</b> and a richer understanding of the references within the lyrics. For example, in the song [...] "Everyone's Gone to the Movies," [...] the line [...] "I know you're used to 16 or more, sorry we only have eight" [...] refers not to the count of some article, but to eight-millimeter film, which was lower quality than 16mm or larger formats, underscoring the illicitness of Mr. Lapage's movie parties.|$|E
5000|$|New Release Tuesdays Kevin Davis {{said that}} [...] "after <b>repeated</b> <b>listens,</b> the sincere and poignant lyrics, musical {{excellence}} and Mike Weaver’s compelling vocals make Love Come To Life my new top album by this great band surpassing {{all of their}} previous excellent albums." ...|$|R
5000|$|If you wanna {{know when}} Clawfinger peaked, {{put on the}} tune “Warfair” from their debut “Deaf, dumb, blind”. That’s the only song I need to hear, and own, by Clawfinger.

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in 2008 in Toronto’s Phase 1 and Alex Lifeson's Lerxst Sound studios. Thornley describes his wish to achieve a vintage rock sound embellished with subtle hooks and [...] "fairy dust, bells and whistles," [...] similar to Bruce Springsteen’s Born to Run, where <b>repeated</b> <b>listens</b> reveal more and more enjoyment with new layers apparent each time.|$|R
2500|$|The {{sound of}} the album drew {{complimentary}} comparisons to Tool and Godspeed You! Black Emperor, being praised for its subtlety and gradual evolution of structure. However, some critical responses to the similarity with Tool were not so positive, with Joe Davenport arguing that [...] "In the Absence of Truth plays out like some mediocre hybrid of Tool and Panopticon". Brandon Stosuy of Pitchfork Media posits that [...] "the set's so finely wound that on the first few listens {{it seemed like the}} steady diet of Tool had perhaps transformed Isis into an emaciated, innocuous version of their older selves". However, he continues to suggest that the album [...] "just require close (and <b>repeated)</b> <b>listening</b> to initiate an unravelling". Tracks selected as stand-outs include [...] "Not in Rivers, but in Drops", [...] "Garden of Light", and [...] "Dulcinea", specifically praising the climax of the piece. [...] "Holy Tears" [...] is labeled as revealing the [...] "true, outward strength of Isis",| publisher = Prefix Magazine| date=21 February 2007|accessdate =5 August 2007}} and is selected as [...] "a beacon of light in the darkness" [...] in a generally scathing Delusions of Adequacy review.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{distinct}} {{elements of the}} Beach Boys' style were their voices' nasal quality {{and the use of}} falsetto in their harmonies over a run-on melody. Jim Miller observed, [...] "On straight rockers they [...] sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead [...] … on ballads, Brian played his falsetto off against lush, jazz-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures." [...] Music theorist Daniel Harrison adds, [...] "But even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone." [...] Lyric collaborator Van Dyke Parks argued that, [...] "Wilson made music as accessible as a cartoon and yet rewarded <b>repeated</b> <b>listening</b> as much as Bach: Just as the best comic books can turn cliché into high art, so can the best pop music. Brian does that. He can take common or hackneyed material and raise it from a low place to the highest, and he can do it with an economy of imagery that speaks to the casual observer—bam! It's no coincidence that he was working {{at the same time that}} [...] Warhol and [...] Lichtenstein were doing pop art." [...] Wilson wrote in 1990: ...|$|E
2500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, MDNA received an average score of 64, based on 34 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Andy Gill from The Independent {{felt that the}} album represented a [...] "determined, no-nonsense restatement" [...] of Madonna's brand of music, after the underwhelming response she had received for Hard Candy. Rolling Stone writer Joe Levy rated the release 3.5 out of 5 stars, describing it as a [...] "disco-fied divorce record". He found naughtiness in {{the music and the}} compositions, however there was also depth in the content, which Levy felt deserved <b>repeated</b> <b>listening</b> of the record. Priya Elan of NME called MDNA as [...] "a ridiculously enjoyable romp", also listing the depth of the songs and their intimate lyrics as [...] "some of the most visceral stuff [...] ever done". Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani found the album to be [...] "surprisingly cohesive" [...] in spite of the multiple producers, and commended the singer and Orbit's compositions as among the best. For Shirley Halperin from Billboard, it was better that Madonna did not produce retro sounding music as many of music veterans end up creating. [...] "Always {{one step ahead of the}} latest sounds and production trends... her brand of dance music meets delectable pop comes at a perfect time, just as EDM has, to put it plainly, taken over," [...] Halperin theorized.|$|E
5000|$|Album ReviewSpectrum Culture - [...] "At first blush, it’s easy to miss MEN’s largely {{feminist and}} LGBT {{politics}} because, now on their second LP, they’ve become purveyors of throbbing and glistening club-ready electropop that’ll get your body moving before your mind can wrap around the message. It’s only upon <b>repeat</b> <b>listens</b> that {{the depth of}} Samson’s songwriting surfaces, making MEN all the more dynamic." ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite this, Allmusic {{also made}} Kollected Works an album pick and {{published}} a review declaring {{it to be}} [...] "inventive new wave pop of the highest order" [...] and [...] "a record that combined the musical sensibilities of the Police and the lyrical concerns of Weird Al Yankovic". The reviewer applauded the album's humor and eccentricity, while contending that the tracks also have plenty of musical depth to make them hold up to <b>repeated</b> <b>listens.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a {{television}} interview with BBC Breakfast, Love noted that the main themes of [...] "You Know My Name" [...] were fame and notoriety, referring to it as [...] "a really simple, sweary, fast in-your-face song" [...] about her public reputation. She described how she was inspired to write the song after <b>repeated</b> <b>listens</b> to The Rolling Stones 1968 song [...] "Sympathy for the Devil", which left her [...] "feeling quite like a rock villainess".|$|R

5000|$|... ==Reception== The Allmusic review states [...] "Everything on {{the album}} is {{visually}} evocative the way good soundtrack music should be, yet the individual cuts are tight and melodic enough to hold up to <b>repeated</b> <b>listens.</b> The end result is a soundtrack that succeeds both as a film score and a stand-alone album. This unique combination makes Bullitt {{one of the finest}} achievements in the Lalo Schifrin catalog {{and one of the best}} action film scores ever written".|$|R
5000|$|Salaam Remi {{contributes}} to the song's emotional weight with his maudlin, noir-style string samples taken from Bad Man Waltz. Epinions described the song's composition: [...] "The musical layers are deceptively intricate, with a unison string/woodwind line that continually evolves throughout the song and a very simple vocal harmony mix that moves into a call and response against Jazmine's pleas. Neither of the facets scream for attention but <b>repeated</b> <b>listens</b> bear out just how well they framed this song." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nick Kent {{wrote that}} with [...] "We'll Run Away", Wilson and Usher [...] "zeroed in" [...] {{on a certain}} type of teen angst that would culminate more fully in Wilson's [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice".

50|$|By {{comparing}} Beckett’s work to that {{of serial}} composers such as Schoenberg and Webern, White highlights the difficulties for listeners who are obliged to actively engage with challenging new form and content.

5000|$|In his All About Jazz review, Mark Corroto {{says that}} [...] "the music {{was written in}} the fashion of a Duke Ellington or Gil Evans suite" [...] and claims [...] "Roy Campbell has {{composed}} a fully formed suite, one which is worth <b>repeated</b> <b>listening</b> sessions." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 2009 review, the BBC {{hailed the}} album as [...] "a solid gold classic." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice, {{on the other}} hand, {{assigned}} it a [...] "neither" [...] rating, indicating an album that does not warrant <b>repeated</b> <b>listening</b> despite coherent craft {{and one or two}} highlights.|$|E
5000|$|Therefore, {{it comes}} as little {{surprise}} that his latest chart botherer - a rendition of Kish Mauve's 2009 electro-rock hit 'Come On' - {{is far more than}} a note-for-note rehash. [...] "Walk away, that's what you do," [...] he bawls innocently over bobbing synths courtesy of Richard X, before defiantly calling [...] "come on, come on" [...] to his contrary lover. In fact, even after <b>repeated</b> <b>listens,</b> Young's lounge-pop reinvention still sounds like a different number altogether.|$|R
5000|$|One {{reviewer}} stated [...] "There’s {{an overall}} mood of passiveness to Silverwater {{that stands in}} direct contrast to the more aggressive Chemist. This is The Necks at their most reflective, utilising their key tools of minimalism and repetition to create a gently trance-inducing piece of music. Though occasional bursts of intensity serve to stave off monotony, Silverwater remains a largely subdued affair. That it’s so utterly engaging, and so amenable to <b>repeat</b> <b>listens</b> is testament to the undeniable skill of the musicians involved".|$|R
25|$|A Kiss in the Dreamhouse is a feat of {{imagination}} scarcely ever recorded. It's breathtaking. Somehow, a bold assurance of intention {{has met with}} a hunger for experimenting with sound to expand an already formidable group of songs into pure, open-minded ambiguity. The flesh of the song will balloon out or contort into unimaginable patterns; indecipherable echoes volley between {{the walls of the}} recording; glassy, splintered tones pierce the luxuriant sheen of the mix. <b>Repeated</b> <b>listens</b> trick the sense of balance; tremendous risks are taken.|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic {{also stated}} that the remix of the single by Jay Gordon {{was better than the}} original, {{especially}} for <b>repeated</b> <b>listening,</b> but criticised the second bonus track, a live recording of [...] "Butterfly", stating that the extremely monotonous vocals served only to remind people to avoid possible live albums by Crazy Town.|$|E
5000|$|.....(Cooper's) {{arrangements}} of the Porter standards are knockouts. Propulsive and sassy on an initial listen, revealing subtle shadings and intricate nuances upon <b>repeated</b> <b>listening.</b> Very forthright and mainstream.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} to Glide Magazine, Nathan Connolly spoke of the band's desire to not sound like their earlier work, but still maintain their [...] "melody and honesty".

500|$|Jackson G. Marx was {{similarly}} conflicted in Australian Rolling Stone, writing, [...] "They create painstaking technical 'works' of art. This {{is not necessarily}} a compliment. Sometimes it's a certified jerk-off." [...] Despite describing some songs as, [...] "tragically clever," [...] and, [...] "grooveless monstrosities," [...] he scored the album three stars from five, and wrote of the pleasure of <b>repeated</b> <b>listens.</b> [...] "'Tail', for example, is tangled and inert and teeters precariously on the brink of disappearing up its own arsehole, but a determined listener will find its hooks more infecting with each spin." ...|$|R
5000|$|Christian Music Zines Tyler Hess said [...] "this is the {{national}} debut for the self labeled pop-rock band from the Lone Star State. Although, it’s much more pop than rock. It seems this was written specifically for Christian radio. It will fit right in on your Jesus-loving, soccer mom-listening, nicely complemented by the cheesy radio host, hometown station." [...] Hess wrote [...] "overall, it’s well written, but there’s nothing that really will bring me back for a <b>repeat</b> <b>listen.</b> It’s a good album, but not as edgy as I prefer." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a four-starred {{review for}} The Telegraph, its Culture Editor Martin Chilton {{said that the}} album [...] "shows a {{craftsman}} at work...In Your Heart shows {{he still has a}} power to move with his songwriting".
