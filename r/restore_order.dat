She was dispatched with orders to <b>restore</b> <b>order</b> and to implement martial law if necessary. While Hobbs was traveling to Eastern Oregon, both she and Governor West were coy with reporters about the presence of the militia, suggesting that Hobbs might be acting alone.|$|E

The player-character Gomez receives a fez that reveals his two-dimensional (2D) world {{to be one of}} four sides of a three-dimensional (3D) world. The player rotates between these four 2D views to realign platforms and solve the game's puzzles.

At Ostrolenka (16 February 1807), Gazan's troops took three guns and two Russian colors. Otherwise, his troops stayed in their winter quarters.

5|$|The Blue-Green rivalry often {{erupted into}} gang warfare, and street {{violence}} {{had been on}} the rise in the reign of Justin I (r. 518–527), who took measures to <b>restore</b> <b>order,</b> when the gangs murdered a citizen in the Hagia Sophia. Riots culminated in the Nika riots of 532 AD during the reign of Justinian, which began when the two main factions united and attempted unsuccessfully to overthrow the emperor.|$|E
5|$|The Pagan Empire {{disintegrated}} and anarchy ensued. The Mongols, {{who probably}} preferred the situation, {{did nothing to}} <b>restore</b> <b>order</b> in the next ten years. In March 1297, they accepted the voluntary submission of King Kyawswa of Pagan although he controlled little beyond {{the capital city of}} Pagan (Bagan). But Kyawswa was overthrown nine months later, and the Mongols were forced to intervene, leading to their second invasion in 1300–01.|$|E
5|$|The {{leader of}} the Congolese {{province}} of Katanga, Moise Tshombe, requested British and Rhodesian forces to enter the country to <b>restore</b> <b>order.</b> Welensky was sympathetic to the situation but unable to act; the British government, which had ultimate jurisdiction over the federation, disallowed him from mobilising the armed forces. Tshombe declared Katanga unilaterally independent on 11 July, one day after requesting British and Rhodesian assistance. Welensky pleaded with Macmillan to deploy the Rhodesian forces but Macmillan rebuffed him, telling Welensky their hopes were pinned on the United Nations being able to <b>restore</b> <b>order,</b> and hoping for a wholly neutral or anti-communist Congo. United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, hoping to negotiate a solution to Katanga's secession, agreed to meet Tshombe at Ndola. However, Hammarskjöld's plane crashed close to Ndola, and he was killed. Welensky was subsequently blamed for the accident throughout the communist and Afro-Asian world, becoming a hated figure and a lingering symbol of colonialism. Welensky's attitude towards Katanga and the Congo would strain relations between the federation and the British until its dissolution.|$|E

5|$|A race riot {{broke out}} in May 1943 of whites against blacks. ADDSCO {{management}} had long maintained segregated conditions at the shipyards, although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to <b>restore</b> <b>order,</b> but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work, keeping them away for their safety.|$|E
5|$|Although a peace {{agreement}} was made in October 2000, violence ensued in the city streets in March 2002 when two diplomats from New Zealand and numerous others were murdered. In July 2003, conditions had become so bad in Honiara that the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), consisting of multiple Pacific nations under Australian leadership, was invited into the country by the Solomons Government to <b>restore</b> <b>order.</b> In 2006, riots broke out following the election of Snyder Rini as Prime Minister, destroying a part of Chinatown and making more than 1,000 Chinese residents homeless. The riots devastated the town and tourism {{in the city and}} the islands was severely affected.|$|E
5|$|Even before Diarmait's demise, the Uí Chennselaig {{began to}} fight amongst {{themselves}} in a struggle that was almost certainly an after-effect of Diarmait's sons' untimely deaths. Specifically, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters, and the eleventhfourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen reveal that Domnall battled {{against the forces of}} his own first cousin once removed, Donnchad mac Domnaill Remair (died 1089), before Diarmait's ally, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1086), was able to intervene and <b>restore</b> <b>order</b> in the Kingdom of Leinster.|$|E

5|$|In January 1952, the 24th Infantry Division, which {{suffered}} over 10,000 {{casualties in}} 18 months of fighting, was redesignated as the Far East Theater reserve {{and pulled out}} of Korea. It returned to Japan to rebuild. The 34th Infantry Regiment was reconstituted, and the division returned to full strength during the next year, having been replaced in Korea by the 40th Infantry Division of the California Army National Guard. In July 1953, the division returned to Korea to <b>restore</b> <b>order</b> in prisoner of war camps. It arrived {{two weeks before the}} end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Jeff, {{eager to}} get away, {{deliberately}} stirs a fight among the group, then leaves once more to get the test answers. Dr. Duncan hands him a sealed envelope, but only in return for Jeff's Lexus. When Jeff returns, the group is in turmoil, and Britta promises {{to go out with}} him if he can <b>restore</b> <b>order.</b> He does this through an inspirational speech, but Britta sees through his lies and asks him to leave. Jeff then comes clean about everything, adding that since he now has the test answers he does not need the study group. As the group turns against him he leaves.|$|E
5|$|The crowd {{moved away}} from the {{immediate}} area of the custom house, but continued to grow in nearby streets. Captain Preston immediately called out most of the 29th Regiment, which adopted defensive positions in front of the state house. Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson was summoned to the scene, and was forced by the movement of the crowd into the council chamber of the state house. From its balcony he was able to minimally <b>restore</b> <b>order,</b> promising there would be a fair inquiry into the shootings if the crowd dispersed.|$|E

5|$|To prevent Jewish {{violence}} from further escalating, Agrippa assembled the populace and delivered a tearful {{speech to the}} crowd in the company of his sister, but the Jews alienated their sympathies when the insurgents burned down their palaces. They fled the city to Galilee where they later gave themselves up to the Romans. Meanwhile, Cestius Gallus moved into the region with the twelfth legion, but was unable to <b>restore</b> <b>order</b> and suffered defeat at the battle of Beth-Horon, forcing the Romans to retreat from Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Abir {{enjoyed a}} boom {{through the late}} 1890s, by selling a {{kilogram}} of rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr which had cost them just 1.35 fr. However, this came {{at a cost to}} the human rights of those who could not pay the tax with imprisonment, flogging and other corporal punishment recorded. Abir's failure to suppress destructive harvesting methods and to maintain rubber plantations meant that the vines became increasingly scarce and by 1904 profits began to fall. During the early 1900s famine and disease spread across the concession, a natural disaster judged by some to have been exacerbated by Abir's operations, further hindering rubber collection. The 1900s also saw widespread rebellions against Abir's rule in the concession and attempts at mass migration to the French Congo or southwards. These events typically resulted in Abir dispatching an armed force to <b>restore</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the assassination, Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony) {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with Caesar's adopted son and great-nephew, Gaius Octavianus (Octavian). Along with Marcus Lepidus, they formed an alliance known as the Second Triumvirate. They held powers that were nearly identical to the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution. As such, the Senate and assemblies remained powerless, even after Caesar had been assassinated. The conspirators were then defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. Eventually, however, Antony and Octavian fought {{against each other in}} one last battle. Antony was defeated in the naval Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and he committed suicide with his lover, Cleopatra. In 29 BC, Octavian returned to Rome as the unchallenged master of the Empire and later accepted the title of Augustus ("Exalted One"). He was convinced that only a single strong ruler could <b>restore</b> <b>order</b> in Rome.|$|E
