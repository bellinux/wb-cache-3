50|$|Rolling mills {{are often}} divided into roughing, {{intermediate}} and finishing rolling cages. During shape rolling, an initial billet (round or square) with edge of diameter typically ranging between 100-140 mm is continuously deformed {{to produce a}} certain finished product with smaller cross section dimension and geometry. Different sequences can be adopted to produce a certain final product starting from a given billet. However,since each rolling mill is significantly expensive (up to 2 million euros), a typical requirement is to contract the number or rolling passes. Different approaches have been achieved including empirical knowledge, employment of numerical models, and Artificial Intelligence techniques. Lambiase et al. validated a finite element model (FE) for predicting the final shape of a <b>rolled</b> <b>bar</b> in round-flat pass. {{one of the major}} concern when designing rolling mills is {{to reduce the number of}} passes; a possible solution to such requirement is represented by the slit pass also called split pass which divided an incoming bar in two or more subpart thus virtually increasing the cross section reduction ratio per pass as reported by Lambiase.Another solution for reducing the number of passes in the rolling mills is the employment of automated systems for Roll Pass Design as that proposed by Lambiase and Langella. subsequently, Lambiase further developed an Automated System based on Artificial Intelligence and particularly an integrated system including an inferential engine based on Genetic Algorithms a knowledge database based on an Artificial Neural Network trained by a parametric Finite element model and to optimize and automatically design rolling mills.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{analyzes}} {{the propagation of}} fatigue cracks in pearlitic steel in two materials, hot <b>rolled</b> <b>bar</b> and cold drawn wire. The experimental procedure consisted of fatigue tests on cylindrical bars under tensile loading, using steps with decreasing amplitude of stress and constant stress range during each step. Results show how the cold drawing process improves the fatigue behaviour of eutectoid steel by retarding the fatigue crack growth rate in the Paris regime. The fracto-metallographic analysis shows how the microstructural anisotropy of the drawn steel (consequence of the drawing process itself) creates {{a change in the}} fracture crack path in the form of local micro-deflections (and thus multiaxially-driven fatigue propagation at the very local microscale). The net fatigue surface increases with cold drawing due to the higher angle of crack micro-deflections {{in the case of the}} heavily drawn material, thereby allowing a correction of the Paris law curves by considering the real (experimental) fatigue crack path (multi-deflected; locally multiaxial) and the theoretical fatigue crack path (non deflected; locally uniaxial) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this study, various {{experimental}} methods are employed {{to determine the}} anisotropic fatigue behavior of a 25 MnCrSiVB 6 forged steel (Metasco MC).

Results obtained from monotonic tensile tests and Charpy impact tests show that the material has isotropic fracture strength and anisotropic ductility. The influence of the inclusion clusters is clearly demonstrated via observation of the fracture surfaces. Concerning the fatigue behavior, results from a classical staircase experimental procedure are compared to results from self-heating fatigue tests. For specimens orientated at 0 ° relative to the rolled direction, microcrack initiation is controlled by the material matrix and the prediction of the fatigue strength with the self-heating method has been observed to be correct. For specimens orientated at 45 ° and 90 °, the elongated manganese sulfide inclusion clusters are the origin of crack initiation and the fatigue strength drops significantly. For this case, it appears that the self-heating method has difficulty predicting the fatigue behavior...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that texture and {{microstructure}} {{play a crucial role in}} determining properties of metallic materials. The evolution of microstructure and texture during deformation and annealing of copper and some copper base alloys have been investigated to some extent. However, the knowledge about the role of the mode of deformation, particularly different variants of rolling deformation, is still very limited for deformation and annealing texture of two-phase copper alloys. Therefore it appeared important to study the influence of deformation path (in the present case, mode of rolling) on texture and microstructure in two-phase copper alloy Cu- 40 Zn alloy. Hot <b>rolled</b> <b>bar</b> of Cu- 40 Zn alloy (as-received material) was subjected to unidirectional and cross rolling (multi-step cross-rolling) at room temperature with strain per pass (true strain) being constant for each step. In multi-step cross-rolling, the rolling direction was altered (rotated by 90 °) after each pass. Strains corresponding to rolling reduction of 50 % and 80 % were given to as-received material through each of the different mode of rolling. In a second route, the as-received material was solution treated at 800 °C for 4 hours first and then subjected to rolling in the same manner as above. A piece was cut from each of the as-rolled materials and was subjected to annealing at 560 °C for one hour for recrystallization. The bulk textures were determined by measuring the pole figures at the center of the rolled as well as the annealed specimen using X-ray texture goniometer based on Schultz reflection geometry. Three dimensional texture analyses were carried out using the method of orientation distribution function(ODF). Micro-textures and associated microstructural parameters were determined using a Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscope(FEG-SEM) operated at 20 KV, equipped with Electron back scattering detector(EBSD). In the experimental material, texture was examined for both the α (fcc) and the β (ordered cubic) phases. In the present investigation, α phase of unidirectional rolled as-received material had Bs { 011 } orientation as the strongest component whereas for multi-step cross rolled material P(BND) { 011 } orientation had the maximum intensity, which could be obtained by rotating the Bs orientation and about ND. The texture development of β phase of as-received unidirectional rolled sample could be understood in terms of relaxed constraints Taylor model. The initial texture had a pronounced effect on texture development of α phase for solution treated alloy during deformation. This material exhibited very strong P(BND) { 011 } orientation for unidirectional as well as for multi-step cross rolling. For cross rolled alloys, this orientation is promoted by two factors simultaneously, (i) initial texture and (ii) special attributes of cross rolling process. The volume fraction of cube oriented grains was very low for all recrystallized samples because of dominance of Bs orientation in the deformation texture plus formation of shear bands in the microstructure. The texture of β phase for unidirectionally rolled solution treated alloy got sharpened on annealing. However, strength of texture decreased with increasing deformation. Grain boundary (and CSL boundary) analyses were carried out with EBSD data. These analyses indicated that all the recrystallized samples had a high number of Σ 3 boundaries. The proportion of Σ 3 boundaries was higher in multi-step cross-rolled annealed material. The deformed material had higher number fraction of low angle boundary than any other special boundary. Solution treated material had an average grain size of α phase smaller than the as-received material. Another dimension of the present investigation was to characterize the microstructural features in three dimension(3 D) in order to examine the morhphology of constituent phases using serial sectioning. In the present work, 3 D studies were carried out on the alloy after post deformation annealing. The alignment of serial section images and generation of 3 D image out of the stack of 2 D images was carried out through standard software. The same was used to measure the suitable 3 D microstructural parameters from the 2 D sections. Three dimensional microstructural parameters like mean caliper diameter of β particle, number of β particles per unit volume ‘Nv’, surface to volume ratio for β phase particles (α- β interface) ‘Sv’, were calculated. Number of β particle intercepts per unit area ‘NA’ was determined by measuring number of β phase particle in each section. The volume of a β particle as calculated from the caliper diameter using three-dimensional microstructural analysis, which could not get directly determined with conventional two-dimensional microscopy...|$|E
