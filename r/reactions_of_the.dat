Critical <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode ranged from mixed to positive, as many believed the series was finally finding its footing. Others however critiqued the episode for seeming too ordinary for a science fiction series.|$|E
5|$|Weinreb and Nahm {{originally}} {{proposed the}} following reaction mechanism {{to explain the}} selectivity shown in <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Weinreb–Nahm amide. Their suggestion was that the tetrahedral intermediate (A below) formed {{as a result of}} nucleophilic acyl substitution by the organometallic reagent is stabilized by chelation from the methoxy group as shown. This intermediate is stable only at low temperatures, requiring a low-temperature quench.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} {{has had an}} official website since 1999. Webcasts have been provided since 2005. Since 2006, between February and the Eurovision final in May, SR has webcast a radio station dedicated to the competition called P4Melodifest. On P4, the public previews semifinalists every Friday. Broadcast the night after the final, a dagen efter ("the day after") television programme acts as an epilogue to the event. It gauges the <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finalists after the competition's climax. No commentary is given for the event on television. Carolina Norén is commentator on the event for Sveriges Radio. The festival has been broadcast in widescreen since 2002 and Dolby Digital since 2004.|$|E

5|$|The <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> native Aboriginal {{inhabitants}} to {{the sudden}} arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied, but were inevitably hostile when the settler's presence led to competition over resources, {{and to the}} occupation of the indigenous inhabitants' lands. European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation. By and large neither the British nor the Aborigines approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare. At times, however, the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units. Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands, while many Aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes.|$|E
5|$|Two {{series of}} {{nitrogen}} oxohalides are known: the nitrosyl halides (XNO) and the nitryl halides (XNO2). The first are very reactive gases {{that can be}} made by directly halogenating nitrous oxide. Nitrosyl fluoride (NOF) is colourless and a vigorous fluorinating agent. Nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) behaves {{in much the same way}} and has often been used as an ionising solvent. Nitrosyl bromide (NOBr) is red. The <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nitryl halides are mostly similar: nitryl fluoride (FNO2) and nitryl chloride (ClNO2) are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents.|$|E
5|$|Boron has two {{naturally}} occurring and stable isotopes, 11B (80.1%) and 10B (19.9%). The mass difference {{results in a}} wide range of δ11B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11B and 10B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay. It has a half-life of 3.5×10−22 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boron species B(OH)3 and −. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H2O phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the − ion onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in 11B(OH)3 and therefore may be responsible for the large 11B enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust; this difference may act as an isotopic signature.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{pyrrolidine}} enamine <b>of</b> cyclohexanone {{with several}} malonic acid derivatives gave good yields <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding Knoevenagel adducts when one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activating substituents was a cyano group. The above enamine, after alkylation at the 2 -position with methyl acrylate, gave similar yields <b>of</b> Knoevenagel products. <b>Reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alkylated enamine with lithioacetonitrile gave, after acidification, an annulated product by internal Knoevenagel reaction. The latter product was also obtained by a Dieckmann ring closure <b>reaction.</b> <b>The</b> Michael <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substituted Knoevenagel products was examined {{and found to}} be facile with several nucleophiles.

5|$|Investigation on this {{reaction}} was continued; {{the research was}} aimed at looking for fission fragments of isotopes of element 105. A subsequent paper was published in February 1970. Two activities were found, with half-lives of 14 ms and 2.2±0.5 s. The former activity was assigned to 242mfAm; the latter one was described as having been caused by an isotope of element 105. The possibility that the latter activity could come from a transfer reaction and thus not be from element 105 {{was said to be}} diminished {{by the fact that the}} yield ratio for {{this reaction}} was lower than that of the 242mfAm-producing transfer reaction. The idea that this synthesis reaction was indeed a (22Ne,xn) reaction was supported by research on <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 243Am target with 18O; reactions producing 256103 and 257103 showed very little spontaneous fission (SF) activity (matching the established data), and the reaction producing heavier 258103 and 259103 produced no SF activity at all, falling in line with theoretical data.|$|E
5|$|The {{light energy}} {{captured}} by chlorophyll a is initially {{in the form}} of electrons (and later a proton gradient) that's used to make molecules of ATP and NADPH which temporarily store and transport energy. Their energy is used in the light-independent <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Calvin cycle by the enzyme rubisco to produce molecules of the 3-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the first product of photosynthesis and the raw material from which glucose and almost all other organic molecules of biological origin are synthesised. Some of the glucose is converted to starch which is stored in the chloroplast. Starch is the characteristic energy store of most land plants and algae, while inulin, a polymer of fructose is used for the same purpose in the sunflower family Asteraceae. Some of the glucose is converted to sucrose (common table sugar) for export {{to the rest of the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|To {{transport}} the raiders to the island, two tugs, Vulcan and Nuneaton, {{were provided by}} the Governor of Nigeria, Sir Bernard Bourdillon. The raiding force would consist of 32 men, four SOE agents, 11 commandos from the SSRF and 17 men recruited from the local population to crew the two tugs. The mission suffered a blow when the British General Officer Commanding (GOC) West Africa Command, General Sir George Giffard refused to support the mission and would not release the 17 men required, stating it would compromise some unnamed plans {{he had in mind}} and the act of piracy would have repercussions. Responding to the concerns of the GOC West Africa, the Admiralty suspended the operation. The Foreign Office was also not in favour of the operation, and neither was the British Embassy in Madrid, which was concerned about the possible <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish government. The final go ahead, eventually supported by the Foreign Office, was not given until 6 January 1942, on the grounds that suspicion of British involvement in the raid was inevitable; what counted was the avoidance of any tangible proof. As a safeguard the Admiralty also dispatched , a , to intercept the vessels at sea, which would provide the cover story that they had been intercepted while trying to make their way home to Europe.|$|E

Günter Unger lined up his Do 17 in order to attack a hangar and {{released}} his 20 110-lb bombs before his starboard engine was knocked out. Unteroffizier (Junior Officer or NCO) Schumacher watched as three hangars were destroyed by Unger’s bombs. Unger’s Dornier was then was hit by something. It bled black smoke and lost speed. Unger was engaged by No. 111s Harry Newton. Newton was shot down by accurate return fire and bailed out. However, Newton fired a burst of machine gun fire at the Dornier in frustration before leaving the Hurricane. He damaged the Dornier, but Unger flew on. Oberleutnant (First Lieutenant) Hermann Magin was lining up a hangar when he was hit and slumped over.

40|$|Benzoyl {{peroxide}} {{is still}} {{widely used in}} polymerization reactions and in other experiments where a source of free radicals is required. Quantitative interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> these experiments requires that <b>the</b> mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decomposition <b>of</b> benzoyl peroxide be known with some precision. A review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature showed two main schools <b>of</b> thought on <b>the</b> mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decomposition <b>of</b> benzoyl peroxide.
