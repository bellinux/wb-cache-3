40|$|Motor vehicle {{emissions}} {{have been}} identified as the major source of air pollution in most urban cities. They have a serious impact on our urban air quality and public health. In the present study, the vehicle exhaust gaseous and particle emissions from different fuel types of on-road <b>representative</b> <b>vehicles</b> including petrol/gasoline, diesel, and liquefied petroleum gas vehicles for urban driving conditions ranging from 10 to 70 km h - 1 were investigated using the chassis dynamometer and remote sensing testing systems. Both testing systems have been widely used for dirty screening/clean screening credit utility programs, and for inspection and maintenance programs. T'he measured vehicle exhaust emission concentrations from both testing systems were further calculated into the average gaseous and particle (i. e., PM 0. 1, PM 2. 5, and PM 10) emission factors (EFs) in milligrams or grams per kilometer for different urban driving conditions. The results show that the different fuel types of the selected on-road vehicles and their driving conditions have a direct effect on the characterization of vehicle exhaust gaseous and particle emission factors. The correlation equations of the calculated average vehicle emission factors of different size fractionated exhaust particles and hydrocarbons (HCs) in milligrams or grams per kilometer with a good regression coefficient, R 2, value from different fuel types of on-road <b>representative</b> <b>vehicles</b> were also established. It is demonstrated clearly that the correlation between EF PM and EF HC is highly sensitive to the different fuel types, engine cylinder sizes and rated powers, and aftertreatment emission control and maintenance conditions of the selected on-road vehicles.

40|$|AbstractThis paper investigates {{different}} approaches to integrating the MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator model (MOVES) with microscopic traffic simulators to allow for project-level emissions analysis. The integration methodology is based on using the second-by-second vehicle trajectory output from the traffic simulator to define the link drive schedule required to run MOVES. This {{raises the question of}} how to define a <b>representative</b> <b>vehicle</b> trajectory for each link, because tracking the emissions for individual vehicles is computationally intractable. In this study, the accuracy of two aggregation methods and one sampling method, for defining the representative trajectory, are compared for both freeway and arterial links.

40|$|The present work deals wit h the {{dynamics}} of vehicles that intentionally operate in the ground proximity. The dynamics in ground effect {{is influenced by the}} vehicle orientation with respect to the ground because the aerodynamic force and moment coefficients, which in turn depend on height and angle of attack, also vary with the Euler angles. This feature, usually neglected in the applications, can be responsible for sizable variations of the aircraft performance and stability. A further effect, caused by the sink rate, determines the unsteadiness that modifies the aerodynamic coefficients. In this work, an analytical formulation is proposed for the force and moment calculation {{in the presence of the}} ground and taking the aircraft attitude and sink rate into account. The aerodynamic coefficients are first calculated for a <b>representative</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and its characteristics in ground effect are investigated. Performance and stability characteristics are then discussed with reference to significant equilibrium conditions, while the nonlinear dynamics is studied through the numerical integration of the equations of motion...|$|E

Vehicle position is determined by transforming the perspectively viewed coordinate position of a <b>representative</b> <b>vehicle</b> target into runway coordinates. Vehicle heading is determined from the runway coordinates of two vehicle target points.

40|$|The {{power demand}} of air {{conditioning}} in PHEVs {{is known to}} {{have a significant impact on}} the vehicle’s fuel economy and performance. Besides the cooling power associated to the passenger cabin, in many PHEVs, the air conditioning system provides power to cool the high voltage battery.

In this paper, a <b>representative</b> <b>vehicle</b> model is used to calculate these cooling requirements over a 24 -hour duty cycle. A number of pre-cooling and after-run cooling strategies are studied and effect of each strategy on the performance of the vehicle including, energy efficiency, battery degradation and passenger thermal comfort are calculated.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to identify the}} levels and frequencies of heavy articulated vehicle body vibrations at which the drivers perceive the ride as uncomfortable. The study involved conducting a subjective assessment survey in which a panel of truck drivers {{were asked to rate}} the ride quality provided by a number of road sections with different surface roughness characteristics. The study's objective was achieved by correlating the mean panel ratings (MPRs) to road surface roughness contents in different one-third-octave bands of the roughness spectrum. The results showed that at 100 km/h, truck drivers object mainly to motions resulting from roughness excitations of the low frequency vibration modes of the truck body in the range 1. 42 – 5. 7 Hz. These results were validated by correlating MPRs with the levels of whole body vibrations measured on the driver's seat in a <b>representative</b> <b>vehicle</b> while traversing some test sections. MPRs were found to correlate well with the measured overall vibration total values and the likely comfort reactions to various magnitudes of overall vibration total values given by ISO 2631 - 1.

40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} {{appropriately}} design control laws for hypersonic vehicles, it is paramount {{to understand how}} the flight dynamics are impacted by the interactions between the aerothermodynamics, propulsion system, structural dynamics, and control system. To this end, there has been a significant investment into the modelling of these sub-systems and their integration into a comprehensive model {{that can be used to}} the characterize the flight dynamics of scramjet-powered hypersonic aircraft and still remain amenable to control law design and analysis. In this paper, the development of a comprehensive model of the longitudinal dynamics of generic hypersonic vehicle with an outward-turning, two-dimensional inlet is described. The sub-system models, for the most part, are simple models derived from first-principles and are intended to capture the interactions between the different sub-systems to provide a <b>representative</b> <b>vehicle</b> model. We also will discuss the areas that are important to realizing a hypersonic modelling approach that can take any given vehicle geometry and permit a thorough analysis of its stability and control characteristics and any practical constraints on its operability, the design of a control law, an assessment of it closed-loop performance.

40|$|The {{following}} {{study examines}} how {{the costs and}} benefits of improving fuel economy of vehicles via lightweighting with aluminum closures change with gas price. A process-based cost model is used to evaluate the costs of lightweighting with aluminum for six <b>representative</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and an industry choice-based conjoint decision analysis market model is used to evaluate the benefits of lightweighting given a 0. 5 mpg increase in fuel economy. Vehicles were examined by class size. Compact car owners were observed to be willing to pay for improved fuel economy but consumer preferences indicate insufficient willingness to pay to cover the costs of lightweighting with aluminum for a representative compact car, the Toyota Corolla. However, no conclusion can be made as to whether larger car owners are or are not willing to pay for improved fuel economy.
