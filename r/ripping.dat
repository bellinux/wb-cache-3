This study presents a conceptual model demonstrating how <b>rip</b> channels respond {{to changes in}} wave conditions, focusing on wave energy and wave event duration. Past attempts to relate <b>rip</b> channels to wave conditions have not resulted in good relationships between <b>rip</b> characteristics (e. g. <b>rip</b> spacing) and waves. In order to address this problem, a 3. 3 year <b>rip</b> channel data set was obtained using an improved computer-based technique to locate <b>rips</b> from video imagery. In this study we show how the scale of <b>rip</b> channels (i. e. cross-shore extent), previous wave conditions and the duration of high wave events determine how <b>rip</b> channels will evolve. Observations of six events when <b>rip</b> channels changed their spatial configuration are {{used to create a}} conceptual model for how <b>rip</b> channels respond to changes in the wave conditions. When <b>rip</b> channels are small in relation to the wave energy, these <b>rips</b> are more likely than larger <b>rips</b> (extending less than ~ 70 m cross-shore) to evolve.

40|$|The death domain kinase <b>Rip</b> 1 is {{recruited}} to the tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 and mediates the IkappaB kinase and p 38 MAP kinase pathways. In response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), we find <b>Rip</b> 1 phosphorylated and ubiquitinated, suggesting that <b>Rip</b> 1 phosphorylation may stimulate its ubiquitination. To address {{the contribution of}} the kinase activity of <b>Rip</b> 1 to its ubiquitination and to TNF-alpha signaling, we introduced wild type <b>Rip</b> 1 and a kinase-inactive form of <b>Rip</b> 1, <b>Rip</b> 1 D 138 N, into <b>rip</b> 1 -/- murine embryonic fibroblast cells by retroviral infection. TNF-alpha-induced ubiquitination of <b>Rip</b> 1 is observed in <b>Rip</b> 1 D 138 N cells, supporting the argument that <b>Rip</b> 1 autophosphorylation is not required for <b>Rip</b> 1 ubiquitination. TNF-alpha-induced Ikk and p 38 MAP kinase activation is normal, and the <b>Rip</b> 1 D 138 N cells are resistant to TNF-alpha-induced cell death, indicating that the kinase activity of <b>Rip</b> 1 is not required to mediate its antiapoptotic functions. In the absence of Traf 2, TNF-alpha-induced ubiquitination of <b>Rip</b> 1 is impaired, suggesting that Traf 2 may be the E 3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the TNF-alpha-dependent, ubiquitination of <b>Rip</b> 1.

40|$|<b>RIP</b> 1 and its homologs, <b>RIP</b> 2 and <b>RIP</b> 3, {{form part}} of a family of Ser/Thr kinases that {{regulate}} signal transduction processes leading to NF-κB activation. Here, we identify <b>RIP</b> 4 (DIK/PKK) as a novel member of the <b>RIP</b> kinase family. <b>RIP</b> 4 contains an N-terminal RIP-like kinase domain and a C-terminal region characterized by the presence of 11 ankyrin repeats. Overexpression of <b>RIP</b> 4 leads to activation of NF-κB and JNK. Kinase inactive <b>RIP</b> 4 or a truncated version containing the ankyrin repeats have a dominant negative (DN) effect on NF-κB induction by multiple stimuli. <b>RIP</b> 4 binds to several members of the TRAF protein family, and DN versions of TRAF 1, TRAF 3 and TRAF 6 inhibit <b>RIP</b> 4 -induced NF-κB activation. Moreover, <b>RIP</b> 4 is cleaved after Asp 340 and Asp 378 during Fas-induced apoptosis.

40|$|AbstractThe tumor {{necrosis}} factor receptor 1 (TNFR 1) and the Fas receptor recruit complexes {{formed by}} the interactions between <b>RIP</b> kinase, TRADD, FADD and RAIDD – adaptor proteins that contain death domains – which in turn recruit other proteins to initiate signaling [1 – 5]. To identify proteins associated with the TNF signaling pathway, we performed a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen using <b>RIP</b> as bait. We isolated a kinase, <b>RIP</b> 3, which shares homology with the kinase domain of <b>RIP</b> and <b>RIP</b> 2 (also known as Rick or CARDIAK). <b>RIP</b> 3 could be co-immunoprecipitated with <b>RIP,</b> TRAF 2 and TNFR 1 in mammalian cells. The carboxy-terminal domain of <b>RIP</b> 3, like that of <b>RIP,</b> could activate the transcription factor NFκB and induce apoptosis when expressed in mammalian cells. Interestingly, this region shares no significant sequence homology to the death domain of <b>RIP,</b> the caspase-recruiting domain (CARD) of <b>RIP</b> 2 [6 – 8] or any other apoptosis-inducing domain. As with <b>RIP</b> and <b>RIP</b> 2, the kinase domain of <b>RIP</b> 3 was not required for either NFκB activation or apoptosis induction.

40|$|Necroptosis/programmed {{necrosis}} is {{initiated by}} a macro-molecular protein complex termed the necrosome. Receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK 1 /RIP 1) and <b>RIP</b> 3 are {{key components of}} the necrosome. TNFα is a prototypic inducer of necrosome activation, and {{it is widely believed}} that deubiquitination of <b>RIP</b> 1 at the TNFR- 1 signaling complex precedes transition of <b>RIP</b> 1 into the cytosol where it forms the <b>RIP</b> 1 -RIP 3 necrosome. Cylindromatosis (CYLD) is believed to promote programmed necrosis by facilitating <b>RIP</b> 1 deubiquitination at this membrane receptor complex. We demonstrate that <b>RIP</b> 1 is indeed the primary target of CYLD in TNFα-induced programmed necrosis. We observed that CYLD does not regulate <b>RIP</b> 1 ubiquitination at the TNF receptor. TNF and zVAD-induced programmed necrosis was highly attenuated in CYLD(-/-) cells. However, in the presence of cycloheximide or SMAC mimetics, programmed necrosis was only moderately reduced in CYLD(-/-) cells. Under the latter conditions, <b>RIP</b> 1 -RIP 3 necrosome formation is only delayed, but not abolished in CYLD(-/-) cells. We further demonstrate that <b>RIP</b> 1 within the NP- 40 insoluble necrosome is ubiquitinated and that CYLD regulates <b>RIP</b> 1 ubiquitination in this compartment. Hence, <b>RIP</b> 1 ubiquitination in this late-forming complex is greatly increased in CYLD(-/-) cells. Increased <b>RIP</b> 1 ubiquitination impairs <b>RIP</b> 1 and <b>RIP</b> 3 phosphorylation, a signature of kinase activation. Our results show that CYLD regulates <b>RIP</b> 1 ubiquitination in the TNFα-induced necrosome, but not in the TNFR- 1 signaling complex. In cells sensitized to programmed necrosis with SMAC mimetics, CYLD is not essential for necrosome assembly. Since SMAC mimetics induces the loss of the E 3 ligases cIAP 1 and cIAP 2, reduced <b>RIP</b> 1 ubiquitination could lead to reduced requirement for CYLD to remove ubiquitin chains from <b>RIP</b> 1 in the TNFR- 1 complex. As increased <b>RIP</b> 1 ubiquitination in the necrosome correlates with impaired <b>RIP</b> 1 and <b>RIP</b> 3 phosphorylation and function, these results suggest that CYLD controls <b>RIP</b> 1 kinase activity during necrosome assembly...|$|R

40|$|The {{final step}} in the {{assembly}} of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase or bc 1 complex involves the insertion of the Rieske Fe/S cluster protein, <b>Rip</b> 1.

In the absence of Mzm 1, <b>Rip</b> 1 is prone to either proteolytic degradation or temperature-induced aggregation.

40|$|Background: Receptor {{interacting}} protein 140 (<b>RIP</b> 140) is {{a versatile}} transcriptional co-repressor that plays roles in diverse metabolic processes including fat accumulation in adipocytes. Previously we identified three methylated arginine residues in <b>RIP</b> 140, which rendered its export to the cytoplasm; {{but it was}} unclear what triggered <b>RIP</b> 140 arginine methylation. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we determined the activated PKCe as the specific trigger for <b>RIP</b> 140 arginine methylation and its subsequent export. We identified two PKCe–phosphorylated residues of <b>RIP</b> 140, Ser- 102 and Ser- 1003, which synergistically stimulated direct binding of <b>RIP</b> 140 by 14 - 3 - 3 that recruited protein arginine methyl transferase 1 to methylate <b>RIP</b> 140. The methylated <b>RIP</b> 140 then preferentially recruited exportin 1 for nuclear export. As a result, the nuclear gene-repressive activity of <b>RIP</b> 140 was reduced. In <b>RIP</b> 140 null adipocyte cultures, the defect in fat accumulation was effectively rescued by the phosphoylation-deficient mutant <b>RIP</b> 140 that resided predominantly in the nucleus, but less so by the phospho-mimetic <b>RIP</b> 140 that was exported to the cytoplasm.
