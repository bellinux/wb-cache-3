500|$|The cover artwork shows a photograph, {{taken at}} Easington Colliery, {{of the band}} {{apparently}} having just urinated on a large concrete piling protruding from a slag heap. The decision to shoot the picture came from Entwistle and Moon discussing Stanley Kubrick and the film [...] According to photographer Ethan Russell, most of the band members were unable to urinate, so rainwater was tipped from an empty film canister to achieve the desired effect. The <b>rear</b> <b>cover</b> showed the band backstage at De Montfort Hall, Leicester, amongst a debris of furniture. [...] In 2003, the television channel VH1 named Who's Nexts cover {{one of the greatest}} album covers of all time.|$|E
500|$|Several {{different}} model {{variants of}} the G2 are sold, with most variants differing only in support for regional network types and bands. However, the South Korean version features a removable (but smaller) battery and a MicroSD slot, while the U.S. Verizon Wireless version includes Qi wireless charging, {{but has a}} noticeably different <b>rear</b> <b>cover</b> design with different designs for the buttons and camera, and replaces the solid black option for the button background with a pink pattern option. In January 2014, {{in honor of the}} Chinese New Year, LG released two [...] "limited edition" [...] models of the G2 in selected Asian markets; available in red or gold colors, the limited edition models featured textured casings instead of the glossier plastic used normally by the G2.|$|E
500|$|The G2's {{exterior}} {{consists of}} a polycarbonate shell—unlike its predecessor, which used a glass-based construction. The <b>rear</b> <b>cover</b> is adorned with a subtle pattern resembling carbon fiber. The G2's volume and power keys are located directly below the camera on {{the rear of the}} device. The power button contains an LED lamp, which {{can be used as a}} notification light. The positioning of the buttons on the rear deviates from the majority of smartphones, where they are located on the bezel (side edge) of the phone. LG argued that buttons located on the bezel were harder to reach on larger smartphones, and made it more likely for users to drop their phone when adjusting the volume during a call. As such, the G2's buttons are instead located where the index finger would normally lie when the phone is held. Alongside the power button, the G2 is also [...] powered on by double-tapping on the screen, and turned off by double-tapping on the status bar or a blank area on the home screen, a feature branded as [...] "KnockOn". When the phone is off, the volume keys can also be used to launch directly into the camera or QuickMemo applications by holding them down.|$|E
50|$|Golden Eggs was {{released}} by TMQ in 1975. Almost immediately, it was copied by Phony Graf, another bootlegger. Their release used black and white inserts of the front and <b>rear</b> <b>covers,</b> instead of Stout's colour artwork.|$|R

50|$|The second {{generation}} model improves {{on the original}} model with a higher quality design incorporating a metal frame and optional leather or wood <b>rear</b> <b>covers,</b> along with improved internal specifications such as a quad-core processor and 1080p display.|$|R
500|$|The {{cover sleeve}} and images were shot by Ellen von Unwerth. The cover was {{released}} by Jive Records on October 12, 2007. It features Spears sporting black hair and wearing a pink (blue in the <b>rear</b> <b>cover)</b> dress, and a white fedora. A reviewer for the Ottawa Citizen felt the design was [...] "horrendous". The centerfold pictures feature Spears and a priest in suggestive poses in a confessional. The first image shows Spears, who wears a cross and fishnet stockings, sitting on the priest's lap, while in the second one she leans suggestively against the confessional with the priest sitting {{on the other side}} of the partition. After the album was released, the Catholic League's director of communications Kiera McCaffrey stated that the group considered the photos a [...] "cheap publicity stunt" [...] to promote the album and condemned Spears for [...] "mocking a Catholic sacrament". McCaffrey added: [...] "All we see is how troubled this girl is now, especially with her family, losing her kids, with her career on a downward slide. And now she's put out this album and this is her tactic to promote it?" [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV said that the images were reminiscent of Madonna's music video for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] (1989). The booklet also contains pictures of empty chairs with ripped tabloid pages and still images from the music video for [...] "Gimme More". The album doesn't include a thank-you list, unlike her previous albums.|$|E
500|$|The G2 was {{considered}} by critics to be well-built, but {{was criticized for}} replacing the glass-based construction of the Optimus G with a plainer, plastic-based design, drawing comparisons to recent Samsung products. Ars Technica further criticized the Verizon Wireless version for having a cheaper appearance than the international versions, with a plainer <b>rear</b> <b>cover,</b> modified buttons, and a different speaker layout. The G2's rear buttons were met with equally mixed reception, with most reviewers believing that users {{would be able to}} adjust themselves to operate them. Accordingly, the ability to wake the phone by tapping on the screen {{was considered}} a more convenient method. The G2 was praised for its high-end hardware, with Engadget describing the device as a [...] "beast" [...] with specifications that [...] "seem familiar to anyone who's read a flagship Android phone review in the last 12 months", recognizing that it had become harder for manufacturers to differentiate their flagship products beyond displays and processors. The G2's display was praised for its high resolution and color accuracy, along with LG's efforts to reduce the screen bezel size. The G2 was also praised for having unexpectedly longer battery life than any of its competitors (along with Motorola's Droid Razr Maxx). After lasting about 20 hours of [...] "standard" [...] use in its testing, the G2's battery was considered by Engadget to be [...] "a sign that we're finally crossing into a world of sensible smartphone batteries." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} of Fantastic was impressive, with a cover that sf {{historian}} Mike Ashley has described as [...] "one of the most captivating of all first issues"; the painting, by Barye Phillips and Leo Summers, illustrated Kris Neville's [...] "The Opal Necklace". [...] The fiction included some stories by well known names; in particular, Raymond Chandler's [...] "Professor Bingo's Snuff" [...] would have caught readers' eyes—the story had appeared the year before in Park East magazine, but would have been new to most readers. [...] It was a short mystery in which the fantasy element was invisibility, achieved by magical snuff. [...] Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury also contributed stories, and the issue led with [...] "Six and Ten Are Johnny", by Walter M. Miller. [...] The <b>rear</b> <b>cover</b> reprinted Pierre Roy's painting [...] "Danger on the Stairs", which depicted a snake on a staircase; {{it was an odd}} choice, but subsequent back covers were more natural fits for a fantasy magazine. [...] The quality of the fiction continued to be high for the first year; sf historian Mike Ashley comments that almost every story in the first seven issues was of high quality, and historian David Kyle regards it as an [...] "outstandingly successful experiment". Science fiction bibliographer Donald Tuck dissents, however, regarding the first few years as containing [...] "little of note", and James Blish wrote a contemporary review of the second issue which found it lacking: Blish dismissed three of the seven stories in the Fall 1952 issue as being essentially crime stories written for the sf market, and commented that of the remaining four, only two were [...] "reasonably competent and craftsmanlike".|$|E

500|$|Several {{photographs}} were considered as candidates {{for a single}} cover image, including shots of: a cow on an Irish farm in County Kildare; the nude Clayton; and the band driving a Trabant, an East German automobile they became fond of as a symbol for a changing Europe. Ultimately, a multiple image scheme was used, as U2, Corbijn, Averill, and the producers thought that [...] "the sense of flux expressed by both {{the music and the}} band's playing with alter egos was best articulated by the lack of a single viewpoint". The resulting front sleeve is a 4×4 squared montage. A mix of Corbijn's original images from Berlin and the later photo shoots was used, as the band wanted to balance the [...] "colder European feel of the mainly black-and-white Berlin images with the much warmer exotic climates of Santa Cruz and Morocco". Some {{photographs were}} used because they were striking on their own, while others were used because of their ambiguity. Images of the band with Trabants, several of which were painted bright colours, appear on the sleeve and throughout the album booklet. These vehicles were later incorporated into the Zoo TV Tour set design as part of the lighting system. The nude photo of Clayton was placed on the <b>rear</b> <b>cover</b> of the record. On the US compact disc and cassette sleeves, Clayton's genitals are censored with a black [...] "X" [...] or a four-leaf clover, while vinyl editions feature the photo uncensored. The label of the physical CD and vinyl record features an image of a [...] "babyface" [...] graffitied by artist Charlie Whisker onto an external wall of Windmill Lane Studios. The babyface image was later adopted as a logo for Zoo TV Tour memorabilia and was incorporated into the Zooropa album cover. In 2003, music television network VH1 ranked Achtung Babys sleeve at number 39 on its list of the [...] "50 Greatest Album Covers". Bono has called the sleeve his favourite U2 cover artwork.|$|E
