The threshold for this toxicity is volume-dependent at 55–60Gy, with moderate to severe impairment of swallowing, including aspiration, stricture and feeding tube dependence above a mean dose of 47Gy, with a recommended dose to the inferior constrictor of less than 41Gy.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an alternative vector {{analysis of the}} electromagnetic (EM) <b>fields</b> <b>radiated</b> from thin circularloop antennas of arbitrary radius a. This method, which employs the dyadic Green’s function in the derivation of the EM <b>radiated</b> <b>fields,</b> makes the analysis more general, compact, and straightforward than those two methods published recently by Werner and Overfelt. Both near and far zones are considered so that the EM <b>radiated</b> <b>fields</b> are {{expressed in terms of}} the vector-wave eigenfunctions. Not only the exact solution of the EM fields in the near and far zones outside the region (where r>a) is derived by the use of the spherical Hankel function of the first kind, but also the closed-series form of the EM <b>fields</b> <b>radiated</b> in the near zone inside the region 0 r<a is obtained in series of the spherical Bessel functions of the first kind. As an example, a Fourier cosine series is used to expand an arbitrary current distribution along the loop and the exact representations of the EM <b>radiated</b> <b>fields</b> due to the loop everywhere are obtained in closed form. The closed form reduces to those for the sinusoidal current loop and further for the uniform current loop. Validity of the approximate formulas is discussed and clarified. Error analysis based on numerical computations of the <b>radiated</b> <b>fields</b> is also given to show the accuracy of the limiting cases.

50|$|The EFIE {{describes}} a <b>radiated</b> <b>field</b> E given {{a set of}} sources J, and as such it is the fundamental equation used in antenna analysis and design. It is a very general relationship {{that can be used}} to compute the <b>radiated</b> <b>field</b> of any sort of antenna once the current distribution on it is known. The most important aspect of the EFIE is that it allows us to solve the radiation/scattering problem in an unbounded region, or one whose boundary is located at infinity. For closed surfaces it is possible to use the Magnetic Field Integral Equation or the Combined Field Integral Equation, both of which result in a set of equations with improved condition number compared to the EFIE.

50|$|The {{ground loop}} will be {{carrying}} some current {{at the local}} supply frequency, typically 50 Hz or 60 Hz, due to electromagnetic induction from current-carrying conductors nearby. There is an AC magnetic field everywhere in developed areas; however, its magnitude and direction depend strongly on the local environment and arrangement of current-carrying wiring. This influences the current induced in the ground loop, which is also dependent on the area enclosed by the ground loop and its orientation. The impedance of the loop, basically just its resistance at low frequencies, also influences the induced current that will flow. It is important to realise that for a ground loop to cause problems, {{there must be a}} local magnetic field produced by power frequency or other systems. It is the combination of <b>radiated</b> <b>field</b> and receptive ground loop that causes problems, and the situation can be improved by attention to either one, or both of these. In effect, the ground loop is the secondary of a very loosely coupled transformer, the primary being the summation of all current carrying conductors nearby. Transformer action limits the induced voltage in the loop, and the weak coupling limits the maximum current that will flow, even if the loop resistance is very low. The maximum induced energy is normally quite small, and except in situations very close to a radiating loop carrying high current, there is no prospect of inducing sufficient energy to cause a hazard to humans.|$|E
