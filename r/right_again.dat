5|$|In 1884, Sherman again {{ran for the}} Republican nomination, but his {{campaign}} never gained steam. Blaine was considered the favorite and President Arthur also gathered delegates {{in an attempt to}} win the term in his own <b>right.</b> <b>Again,</b> the Ohio delegation failed to unite behind Sherman, and he entered the convention with only 30 total delegates pledged to him. Former Cincinnati judge Joseph B. Foraker gave a speech nominating Sherman, but it drew little attention. Blaine gathered support the next day, and Sherman withdrew after the fourth ballot. Blaine was duly nominated and went on to lose the election to Democrat Grover Cleveland of New York, the Republicans' first loss in 28 years. Sherman returned to the Senate where, in 1885, he was elected President pro tempore of the Senate. After the death of Vice President Thomas A. Hendricks later that year, Sherman was next in line to the presidency until February 26, 1887, when he resigned the position.|$|E

The highway heads east as two-lane Sudlersville Road and intersects MD 19 (Main Street) before leaving the town. The state highway heads northeast and intersects US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) at a superstreet intersection next to a park and ride lot in the southwest quadrant. Traffic on MD 300 is required to turn right onto US 301, perform a U-turn, then turn <b>right</b> <b>again</b> to continue on MD 300. The highway curves east at Dudley Corners, where the route crosses Red Lion Branch and meets the southern end of MD 290 (Dudley Corner Road) and the north end of Benton Corners Road, which leads to the historic Dudley's Chapel.|$|E

Immediately after {{crossing}} I-80, the route turns right on Auburn Street and <b>right</b> <b>again</b> on Central Street, which bypasses downtown; a business route follows Auburn Street, Grass Valley Street, and Main Street through downtown. SR 174 follows the old Lincoln Highway (US 40) north out of downtown to Rollins Lake Road, where {{the present state}} highway turns northwest along the Colfax Highway. It then crosses the Bear River from Placer County into Nevada County on a 1987 bridge, with the old 1924 bridge preserved for non-motorized traffic. The land flattens out as SR 174 curves north and west through the Empire Mine State Historic Park into Grass Valley. Turning west on Colfax Avenue, the state highway passes under the SR 20/SR 49 freeway before ending just beyond at Auburn Street, the former surface routing of SR 49.|$|E

25|$|Dan is {{introduced}} {{a few days}} into his new role as a consultant and is {{an old friend of}} registrar Greg Douglas (Edward MacLiam). He starts mentoring ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), during her nurse consultant training. He has a hard time teaching her the importance of delegation in a consultant role. They become close and later start dating. Chrissie becomes stressed with the pressure of work, so Dan organises a trip abroad. He later realises she wants to relax, so he cancels and his relationship with Chrissie strengthens. The father of Chrissie's child, registrar Sacha Levy (Bob Barret) finds it hard to accept that Chrissie has moved on. The situation worsens when they have conflicting views on medicine. Dan decides to put his surgeon skills to the test when consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) challenges him to complete his list of operations first. Feeling competitive, Dan rushes through an operation and makes an error. He gets Ric to step in to save the patient, with Ric taking the blame. Dan starts to feel like his relationship with Chrissie isn't going anywhere fast, so he invites her around to consummate their relationship. Chrissie is annoyed by Dan pressuring her, he tries to make things <b>right</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

From Jerome, the route continued along 11th Street (now Clarkdale Parkway), turning right at Main Street in Clarkdale, and then <b>right</b> <b>again</b> at Broadway. It continued past Tuzigoot National Monument, becoming Main Street in Cottonwood, and providing access to Dead Horse Ranch State Park.

500|$|Northeast of {{the state}} park entrance, US113Business (Market Street) splits to the {{northeast}} to directly serve the town of Snow Hill, which is the county seat of Worcester County and contains several museums and colonial era buildings of the river port at the [...] of the Pocomoke River. US113 bypasses the town {{to the south and}} east and intersects MD12 (Snow Hill Road), which connects Snow Hill with Salisbury and Stockton, and MD365 (Public Landing Road). The MD365 junction is a superstreet intersection; MD365 traffic must turn right, use U-turn ramps along US113, and turn <b>right</b> <b>again</b> to continue on MD365. North of MD365, the highway reduces to a two-lane road and crosses Purnell Branch of the Pocomoke River. US113 has a grade crossing with the Snow Hill Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad and turns northeast again as the highway receives the other end of US113Business.|$|E

500|$|Fitch {{continued}} {{to control the}} aircraft's descent by adjusting engine thrust. With the loss of all hydraulics, the crew were unable to control airspeed independent from sink rate. On final descent, the aircraft was going 220 knots and sinking at 1,850 feet per minute (approximately 407km/h forward and 34km/h downward speed), while a safe landing would require 140 knots and 300 feet per minute (approximately 260km/h and 5km/h respectively). Fitch needed a seat for landing; Dvorak offered up his own, {{as it could be}} moved to a position behind the throttles. Dvorak sat in the cockpit's jump seat for landing. Fitch noticed the high sink rate and that the plane started to yaw <b>right</b> <b>again,</b> and pushed the throttles to full power in an attempt to mitigate the high sink rate and level the plane. There wasn't enough time for the flight crew [...] to react. The tip of the right wing hit the runway first, spilling fuel, which ignited immediately. The tail section broke off from the force of the impact, {{and the rest of the}} aircraft bounced several times, shedding the landing gear and engine nacelles and breaking the fuselage into several main pieces. On the final impact, the right wing was shorn off and the main part of the aircraft skidded sideways, rolled over onto its back, and slid to a stop upside-down in a corn field to the right of Runway 22. Witnesses reported that the aircraft [...] "cartwheeled" [...] end-over-end, but the investigation did not confirm this. The reports were due to misinterpretation of the video of the crash that showed the flaming right wing tumbling end-over-end and the intact left wing, still attached to the fuselage, rolling up and over as the fuselage flipped over.|$|E

2500|$|The GOP {{expanded}} its base throughout the South after 1968 (excepting 1976), {{largely due to}} its strength among socially conservative white Evangelical Protestants and traditionalist Roman Catholics. As white Democrats in the South lost dominance of the Democratic Party once U.S. courts declared the Democratic White Primary elections unconstitutional, the region began taking on the two-party apparatus which characterized most of the nation. The Republican Party's transforming leader by 1980 was Reagan, whose conservative policies called for reduced government spending and regulation, lower taxes and a strong anti-Soviet foreign policy. His influence upon the party persists, as nearly every GOP speaker still reveres him. This includes current U.S. President Donald Trump, who prominently utilized {{his own version of}} Reagan's [...] "(Let's) Make America Great Again" [...] slogan during the 2016 U.S. election.

The crew struggled to use the ailerons, which could allow the aircraft to roll but were still unable to change the plane's direction. Finally the flight crew, including First Officer Jaime Herrera and Comendador, disengaged the auto-throttles and resorted to steering via throttle control, reminiscent of United Airlines Flight 232.|$|E
