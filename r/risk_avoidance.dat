2500|$|Since {{members of}} Congress must {{advertise}} heavily on television, this usually involves negative advertising, which smears an opponent's character without {{focusing on the}} issues. Negative advertising is seen as effective because [...] "the messages tend to stick." [...] However, these ads sour the public on the political process in general as most members of Congress seek to avoid blame. One wrong decision or one damaging television image can mean defeat at the next election, {{which leads to a}} culture of <b>risk</b> <b>avoidance,</b> a need to make policy decisions behind closed doors, and concentrating publicity efforts in the members' home districts.|$|E
2500|$|Greek {{organizations}} both {{nationally and}} locally sponsor many <b>risk</b> <b>avoidance</b> {{programs for the}} real benefits of student safety and well-being, {{as well as to}} avoid harmful bad publicity. Hence, these organizations have learned to address criticism quickly: Chapters and national bodies have adopted extensive changes to reduce incidents of hazing and other harmful behaviors. The recent announcement by Sigma Alpha Epsilon to ban [...] "pledging" [...] nationwide is only the latest of such announcements, of revised prospective member programs now adopted by many fraternities. While not limited to fraternities and sororities, harmful activities like underage drinking and hazing are often headlined as local news stories, with fraternity chapters as the most visible examples. [...] In this area too, active and alumni Greek leaders have responded to such negative publicity and the resulting criticism with programs that seek to reduce alcohol abuse and eliminate underage or binge drinking, with risk management training, by self-policing their own chapters, and with more stringent procedures to discipline offenders. All sororities and some fraternity chapters have banned alcohol in their living facilities. National fraternities, through the NIC and sororities through their national and local governing boards require member training each year to combat hazing, underage drinking, sexual assault and other harmful behaviors. Hence, individual chapters are not alone in addressing these problems. Inter-chapter governing boards at Minnesota (listed below by chapter groupings) provide event monitoring services and local risk management training, culminating in the introduction in 2012 of Arkeo, which serves as an inter-Greek cooperative monitoring program to help chapters avoid risk.|$|E

40|$|The article {{identifies}} {{health promotion}} {{activities for the}} oldest people, who often become users of social services due to loss of capabilities, solitude and raising care needs related to worsening health status. The analysis is  based on the literature overview, experts’ consultations and interviews {{on the role of}} the social sector institutions in health promotion in selected countries. Examples of best practices in health promotion for older people in the social sector are presented. These include programmes of health information and campaigns on health <b>risks</b> <b>avoidance,</b> stimulation of physical activity, healthy eating for the oldest seniors, promotion of mental health and support of cognitive abilities, primary prevention activities and stimulation of social and cultural participation. The article concludes that health promotion activities for the oldest population, although on the side of main activities of the social sector, are an important element of activities of public and non-public institutions in providing care to dependent populations. Good practices identified typically involve numerous health promotion activities and require cooperation at the national – policy setting – level and within community. ...|$|R

In particular, the complex concept of ‘informed choice’ for women is now to the fore. Safety in maternity care is an ambiguous concept and professional caregivers have to assess constantly what comprises either a ‘risk’ or a <b>risk</b> management/ <b>avoidance</b> strategy. Care during pregnancy and childbirth {{may be seen as}} a social process that affects both mother and baby in physical and psychological ways.
