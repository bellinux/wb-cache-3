30|$|A stable plate osteosynthesis is {{achievable}} with locking {{plates in}} these fractures, {{as described by}} Kalamaras, Daglar, and Herrmann. Although the results achieved by these authors with distal <b>radius</b> <b>plates</b> are promising, they used plates that were not intended for this fracture. The single distal locking row in the distal <b>radius</b> <b>plates</b> used in these studies are meant to buttress the articular surface of the distal radius in a raft fashion, with all the screws pointing in the same direction. The most significant complication described by these studies was pull-out of the plate when the plate had too little grip in a small or osteoporotic lateral fragment. Some authors advise suture augmentation of the coracoclavicular ligaments or coracoclavicular fixation in such cases [7, 9].

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the radiographic and functional outcome of orthogonal plating (two plates at right angles) via a single volar approach for fixation of intra-articular distal radius fractures with an associated radial column fracture. Methods: In a retrospective, chart-based review, we identified 14 consecutive patients with an intra-articular distal radial fracture who had been treated with locked volar plate fixation and an additional radial column plate. Radial column plates were LCP Distal <b>Radius</b> <b>Plates</b> 2. 4; volar plates were LCP Distal <b>Radius</b> <b>Plates</b> 2. 4 (n = 13) or LCP T-plate (n = 1). These patients were operated on using the extended volar flexor carpi radialis (FCR) approach as described by Orbay. Radiographic measurements, healing rates, time to union, complications, range of motion, the Gartland and Werley score, and the QuickDASH questionnaire were done in order to evaluate the radiographic and functional outcomes of this technique. Results: Thirteen of the 14 fractures healed within 7 weeks after surgery. Two implant removals were done. One patient had malposition of the fracture and carpal tunnel symptoms, which required a second surgery. No other complications (e. g., first dorsal compartment problems, radial plate prominence problems and radial sensory nerve problems) were observed. The average length of follow-up was 30 months (range, 12. 8 months to 5. 4 years). Radiographic results after healing were radial inclination 20 degrees, radial length 11. 4 mm, tilt 68 volar, ulnar variance - 0. 5 mm, articular gap 0. 1 mm and step-off 0. 1 mm. Wrist range of motion was flexion-extension arc 93 degrees, ulnar-radial deviation arc 49 degrees and pronation-supination arc 152 degrees. Nine patients scored 'excellent' on the Gartland and Werley score, while the remaining five patients scored 'good'. The average QuickDASH score was 13. 4. Conclusion: Additional fixation of a radial column process in an intra-articular distal radius fracture via the extended FCR approach using a standard volar plate and radial LCP resulted in good/excellent radiographic and functional outcome.

40|$|Background: Distal radius {{fractures}} are {{the most}} common fractures of the human skeleton, with about ten per cent of the population sustaining a fracture {{at some point in their}} life. The traditional treatment of distal radius fractures was either non-operative, with closed reduction and cast immobilisation, or operative. Operative treatment options are open reduction and internal fixation or closed reduction and fixation with K-wires and/or an external fixator or cast. Until the late 1990 s, open reduction and plate fixation was not a popular treatment option as plates inserted from the dorsal side frequently caused soft tissue complications and plates inserted from the volar side needed additional augmentation as a result of the biomechanical specifics of distal radius fractures. However, with the development of volar locking distal radius plates in 1997, considerable scientific, clinical and commercial interest in the treatment of distal radius fractures by open reduction and plate fixation has developed. The plates do have theoretical advances over other means of fixation as they allow early functional postoperative mobilisation, which might lead to faster recovery, which in turn might allow more expeditious return to work and/or to activities of daily life. I was fortunate to be part of the team that invented and implanted the first volar locking distal <b>radius</b> <b>plate</b> internationally; hence my interest in the treatment of distal radius fractures. Overall aim of the studies presented in this thesis: Primary aims (biomechanical) : • to achieve a better understanding of the biomechanical properties of distal radius volar locking plates – especially in view of the fact that dozens of different plate models are available with considerable differences in design and locking mechanisms • to define optimal configuration, arrangement, placement and numbers of screws in volar locking plates • to compare different plate systems in order to gain insight into the potential clinical behaviour of different locking mechanisms Secondary aims (clinical) : The second aim of this thesis was to evaluate locking distal radius plates in various clinical studies (using real patients) in order to gain insight into the question of whether their outcome and complication rates are comparable to other methods of treatment. Methods: The thesis comprises the result of eight biomechanical and clinical studies, which took place in Austria and Australia. The basis, foundation and initial study of this thesis is a retrospective clinical study conducted in Austria and presents the first international two-year results of experiences with volar locking distal radius plates. Based on this study seven biomechanical studies were performed. These studies tested various platescrew configurations and plate positions of volar locking distal radius plates in order to establish optimal screw number and diameter as well as position of the plate-screw construct relative to the radio-carpal joint line. The testing was performed partly with fresh-frozen cadaver wrists and partly with synthetic radii. The thesis further comprises the results of another clinical prospective multi-centre study relating to distal radial fracture management to which I contributed, being the principal investigator of Neunkirchen General Hospital, Austria. Overall results and conclusions of the studies presented in this thesis: Biomechanical studies: In order to achieve reproducible outcomes and minimise the loss of postoperative displacement, placement of the plate-screw construct as close as possible to the radio-carpal joint line is essential. Postoperative loss of reduction is directly proportional to the distance the distal screws are placed from the joint line. Despite the push for, and marketing of, multi-row implants with six to eight screws and up to three distal screw-rows in the T-part of the volar locking plates, biomechanical data do not show any benefit over implants incorporating a single distal screw row only. The overall diameter of the screws rather than the number seems to be the determining factor in terms of resistance to postoperative displacement. Constructs with threaded screws show significantly higher stability and rigidity than constructs with smooth pegs. Inserting an additional proximal screw close to the fracture line further increases stability. Clinical studies: Treatment of distal radius fractures with volar locking plates allows early postoperative mobilisation with good reproducible radiographic and clinical results, with a limited number of complications. Clinical function and outcome do not appear to be associated with repair of a fracture of the base of the ulnar styloid. The treatment of distal radius fractures with volar locking plates is the only treatment currently available that allows immediate postoperative wrist motion without the need for additional fixation in most cases. There is, however, a need for prospective, randomised, controlled studies to establish whether treatment with volar locking distal radius plates is shown to be more beneficial than conventional treatment methods with regard to earlier return to function and activities of daily life in the short as well as in the long term. While there is a trend towards better outcomes, there is currently no evidence to show a clear advantage of volar locking plates over any other accepted form of treatment. Overall relevance of the studies presented in this thesis: Biomechanical Studies: The recommendations of one of my biomechanical studies was to place the distal locking screws as close as possible to the joint line to prevent postoperative loss of reduction. This has been accepted internationally as the clinical gold standard. Furthermore, I have shown that plates which incorporate more than one distal screw row do not have any biomechanical advantage over plates with a single distal screw row. Plate-screw constructs in which the distal screw row has an overall diameter of less than 12 millimetres display significantly less resistance to postoperative loss of reduction, which has implications for postoperative mobilisation protocols. Threaded locking screws are preferable to smooth locking pegs as they show significantly more resistance to postoperative displacement forces. In certain fracture types it might be beneficial to place a screw close to the fracture in the shaft part of the plate as this has been shown in biomechanical studies to cause less permanent deformation. However the clinical relevance of this finding still needs to be investigated. Clinical Studies: The clinical studies presented in this thesis concluded that open reduction and internal fixation with volar locking plates produces good to excellent results in the majority of patients. The results are independent of the fracture severity, which means that meticulous technique, rather than fracture comminution or bone quality, is necessary to achieve good clinical results. The most pronounced improvements in function and pain are seen within the first twelve months. Furthermore, improved locking mechanisms, smooth titanium coating of the plates and rounded screw heads have shown a significant decrease in the number of tendon and soft tissue complications seen with first generation plates. It has also been shown that associated ulnar styloid fractures do not need to be repaired when stabilising distal radius fractures with volar locking plates...|$|E

When used to treat comminuted distal <b>radius</b> fractures, these <b>plates</b> can damage the flexor tendons. In this study, we sought to determine the radiological and functional results and rate of complications of these plates. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 36 patients (28 males, 8 females; mean age: 46. 4 years) with AO/OTA Type C 2 -C 3 distal radius fractures treated with anatomic volar rim distal <b>radius</b> <b>plates</b> between January 2011 and December 2014. Radial length, radial inclination and palmar tilt were compared with the intact wrist. Results were evaluated with the Mayo wrist and Lidstrom scores. Complications were documented throughout the follow-up period of 23. 8 (range: 12 to 48) months. Results: Postoperative measurements of the radial length, inclination and palmar tilt did not differ significantly. Mayo wrist and Lidstrom scores were good and excellent in 27 and 32 patients, respectively. Flexor tenosynovitis was symptomatic in 15 patients and asymptomatic (localized swelling only) in 21. Plates were removed from 15 patients due to symptomatic tenosynovitis and from six patients due to partial rupture of the flexor pollicis longus tendon. The flexor digitorum profundus tendon of the second finger was also partially ruptured in three patients.

Closure scales of distal <b>radius</b> growth <b>plate</b> data were compared using the Wilcoxon´s test; bone markers were compared using Student´s t-test. Baseline radiographs showed that in 84 % of foals the distal metacarpi were half closed or fully closed at 8 months; thus subsequent evaluations were limited to the distal radius. At 12 months of age, a positive but nonsignificant elevation in calcium urinary fractional excretion was observed in the supplemented group. At 24 months of age, radiographs showed a non-significant but positive effect in the live yeast group, with more than 50 % of foals having closed distal <b>radius</b> growth <b>plates.</b> Although bone markers at 24 months of age did not differ (p > 0. 05) between groups, some individual horses showed a positive effect with yeast supplementatio...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that a {{quantized}} vortex ring in superfluid He 4, moving freely towards a flat plate, gives to it an impulse equal to the fluid impulse of the ring, provided only that the <b>radius</b> of the <b>plate</b> {{is larger than the}} initial vortex radius but smaller than the distance to the source of the ring. This is in agreement with experiment, in contradiction to two previous theoretical analyses...|$|R
40|$|Volar {{fixation}} of dorsally unstable distal radius fractures is a {{new method}} of treatment that provides the benefits of stable internal fixation without the complications of the dorsal approach. A new, fixed-angle fixation device, the distal volar <b>radius</b> (DVR) <b>plate,</b> (Fig. 1) has been intro-duced for this purpose. Experience gained by applying this technique to clinically complex cases led us {{to the realization that}} more exposure, especially in a dorsal di-rection, was necessary than that provided by the tradi-tional volar approaches. The need to reduce fractures with significant articular displacement (Fig. 2) and the need to release dorsal callus in inveterate fractures or nascent malunions led us to use an extended form of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) approach. Volar displaced distal radius fractures are commonl...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{isolating}} bacteriophage T 4 base plates from lysates of Escherichia coli B cells {{infected with the}} ts mutant in gene 19, ts B 31 has been developed. By electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel with sodium dodecyl sulfate the base plates {{have been shown to}} contain five to seven protein components with molecular weights of 36, 000, 53, 000, 66, 000, 81, 000, 87, 000, and probably about 100, 000. Electron microscope studies have demonstrated that base plates may occur in two structural states: in the form of hexagons or stars. Star rays and short fibrils are not radial or elongated and are turned sideways at an angle to the <b>radius.</b> Base <b>plates</b> do not complement in vitro with free tail cores isolated after disintegration of particles of the wild-type bacteriophage...|$|R
50|$|When Carl Linnaeus first {{described}} this species in 1758, he named it Balanus tintinnabulum. The lectotype was depicted by Georg Eberhard Rumphius in 1705, the type locality being Ambon, Indonesia. In a monograph on barnacles in 1854, Charles Darwin described the species {{as being very}} variable and assigned it to Section A of the genus Balanus, characterised by having the parietes, basis, and <b>radii</b> (different <b>plates</b> in the shell wall) permeated by minute pores. In 1916, Henry Augustus Pilsbry elevated Balanus tintinnabulum to subspecies rank and in subsequent years a number of varieties were described. Later it {{was placed in the}} subgenus Megabalanus and in 1976, Newman and Ross elevated Megabalanus to generic rank, giving species rank to each of the 22 subspecies of what had previously been known as Balanus (Megabalanus) tintinnabulum.|$|R
