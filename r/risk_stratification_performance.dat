40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{aimed to}} {{validate}} the prognostic models for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in Chinese patients receiving ursodeoxycholic acid (UCDA), and to compare their performances in predicting the long-term survival. METHODS: Chinese patients with PBC from a tertiary center were identified via electronic search of hospital medical registry. Risk factors associated with adverse events (liver transplantation or death from liver-related causes including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver decompensation) were determined. Transplant-free survival was defined as survival free of liver-related death or transplantation. RESULTS: Of the 144 patients, 41 (28. 5 %) had baseline cirrhosis. The median age at diagnosis was 57. 8 years. During a median follow-up of 7. 0 years, 40 patients died (21 liver-related; 19 non-liver-related), 12 developed HCC, and 10 underwent transplantations. The 5 -, 10 -, and 15 -year transplant-free survival probabilities were 91. 0 %, 78. 1 %, and 58. 9 %, respectively. Independent risk factors for adverse events were increasing age (hazard ratio (HR) 1. 05), cirrhosis (HR 8. 53), and suboptimal treatment response (HR 3. 06). Aspartate aminotransferase/platelet ratio index at 1 year (APRI-r 1) in combination with treatment response optimized the <b>risk</b> <b>stratification.</b> The <b>performances</b> of the GLOBE, UK-PBC scores, Rotterdam criteria, and APRI-r 1 were comparable in predicting adverse events. The area under receiver operating curves within 5, 10, and 15 years were as follows-GLOBE score: 0. 83, 0. 85, and 0. 85, respectively; UK-PBC score: 0. 89, 0. 83, and 0. 79, respectively; Rotterdam criteria: 0. 82, 0. 76, and 0. 80, respectively; APRI-r 1 : 0. 80, 0. 83, and 0. 77, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Sudden {{cardiac death}} (SCD) {{is a serious}} public health problem; the annual {{incidence}} of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in North America is approximately 166, 200.

At the present time, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) remains {{the single most important}} marker for <b>risk</b> <b>stratification.</b> According to current guidelines, most patients with LVEF < 35 % could benefit from prophylactic ICD implantation, particularly in the setting of symptomatic heart failure. Current <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> strategies fail to identify patients at risk of SCD in larger population groups encompassing a greater number of potential SCD victims. However, the best approach to identifying patients and the value of various <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> tools is not entirely clear.

40|$|AbstractBackground and objectiveRisk {{stratification}} aims {{to provide}} physicians with the accurate {{assessment of a}} patient’s clinical risk such that an individualized prevention or management strategy can be developed and delivered. Existing <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> techniques mainly focus on predicting the overall risk of an individual patient in a supervised manner, and, at the cohort level, often offer little insight beyond a flat score-based segmentation from the labeled clinical dataset. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new approach for <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> by exploring a large volume of electronic health records (EHRs) in an unsupervised fashion. MethodsAlong this line, this paper proposes a novel probabilistic topic modeling framework called probabilistic <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> model (PRSM) based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The proposed PRSM recognizes a patient clinical state as a probabilistic combination of latent sub-profiles, and generates sub-profile-specific risk tiers of patients from their EHRs in a fully unsupervised fashion. The achieved stratification results can be easily recognized as high-, medium- and low-risk, respectively. In addition, we present an extension of PRSM, called weakly supervised PRSM (WS-PRSM) by incorporating minimum prior information into the model, {{in order to improve}} the <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> accuracy, and to make our models highly portable to <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> tasks of various diseases. ResultsWe verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a clinical dataset containing 3463 coronary heart disease (CHD) patient instances. Both PRSM and WS-PRSM were compared with two established supervised <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> algorithms, i. e., logistic regression and support vector machine, and showed the effectiveness of our models in <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> of CHD in terms of the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) analysis. As well, in comparison with PRSM, WS-PRSM has over 2 % performance gain, on the experimental dataset, demonstrating that incorporating risk scoring knowledge as prior information can improve the <b>performance</b> in <b>risk</b> <b>stratification.</b> ConclusionsExperimental results reveal that our models achieve competitive <b>performance</b> in <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> in comparison with existing supervised approaches. In addition, the unsupervised nature of our models makes them highly portable to the <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> tasks of various diseases. Moreover, patient sub-profiles and sub-profile-specific risk tiers generated by our models are coherent and informative, and provide significant potential to be explored for the further tasks, such as patient cohort analysis. We hypothesize that the proposed framework can readily meet the demand for <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> from a large volume of EHRs in an open-ended fashion...|$|R

40|$|Thyroid {{cancer is}} an {{increasingly}} common malignancy, with a rapidly rising prevalence worldwide. The {{social and economic}} ramifications {{of the increase in}} thyroid cancer are multiple. Though mortality from thyroid cancer is low, and most patients will do well, the risk of recurrence is not insignificant, up to 30 %. Therefore, it is important to accurately identify those patients who are more or less likely to be burdened by their disease over years and tailor their treatment plan accordingly. The goal of <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> is to do just that. The <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> process generally starts postoperatively with histopathologic staging, based on the AJCC/UICC staging system as well as others designed to predict mortality. These do not, however, accurately assess the risk of recurrence/persistence. Patients initially considered to be at high risk may ultimately do very well yet be burdened by frequent unnecessary monitoring. Conversely, patients initially thought to be low risk, may not respond to their initial treatment as expected and, if left unmonitored, may have higher morbidity. The concept of risk-adaptive management has been adopted, with an understanding that <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> for differentiated thyroid cancer is dynamic and ongoing. A multitude of variables not included in AJCC/UICC staging are used initially to classify patients as low, intermediate, or high risk for recurrence. Over the course of time, a response-to-therapy variable is incorporated, and patients essentially undergo continuous <b>risk</b> <b>stratification.</b> Additional tools such as biochemical markers, genetic mutations, and molecular markers have been added to this complex <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> process such that this is essentially a continuum of risk. In recent years, additional considerations have been discussed with a suggestion of pre-operative <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> based on certain clinical and/or biologic characteristics. With the increasing prevalence of thyroid cancer but stable mortality, this <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> may identify those in whom the risk of conventional surgical treatment may outweigh the benefit.

40|$|Background and Purpose—To aid {{decisions}} for thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation (AF), several risk stratifica-tion schemes that predict stroke risk according to clinical and echocardiographic features have been published. von Willebrand factor (vWf) is a plasma markers of endothelial damage/dysfunction and {{is associated with}} the risk of stroke and vascular events in AF patients. This study determined the additive role of plasma vWf levels to clinical factors for <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> in patients with AF. Methods—We classified 994 AF patients who were enrolled in the SPAF III trial as being at low, moderate, or high risk of stroke and thromboembolism according to the Birmingham and CHADS 2 <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> schemes. vWf levels were classified as elevated when 158 IU /dL. Rates of ischemic stroke and vascular events within each clinical risk stratum with and without plasma vWf levels were compared. Results—The accuracy of both clinical <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> schemes was similar for predicting event rates (Birmingham: ischemic strokes, 0. 642; vascular events, 0. 670; CHADS 2 : ischemic strokes, 0. 672; vascular events, 0. 672).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present review is to {{describe}} how we improve the model for <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> of transplant outcomes in kidney transplantation by incorporating the novel insights of donor-specific anti-HLA antibody (DSA) characteristics. The detection of anti-HLA DSA is widely used for the assessment of pre- and posttransplant risks of rejection and allograft loss; however, not all anti-HLA DSA carry the same risk for transplant outcomes. These antibodies have been shown to cause a wide spectrum of effects on allografts, ranging from the absence of injury to indolent or full-blown acute antibody-mediated rejection. Consequently, the presence of circulating anti-HLA DSA does not provide a sufficient level of accuracy for the <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> of allograft outcomes. Enhancing the predictive performance of anti-HLA DSA is currently one of the most pressing unmet needs for facilitating individualized treatment choices that may improve outcomes. Recent advancements in the assessment of anti-HLA DSA properties, including their strength, complement-binding capacity, and IgG subclass composition, significantly improved the <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> model to predict allograft injury and failure.

Methods: We used data from a prospective observational study in patients admitted to a mixed medical–surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in the Netherlands. <b>Risk</b> <b>stratification</b> was by cutoffs for SpO 2 /FiO 2 and PEEP. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Patients with moderate or severe ARDS with a length of stay of >  24  h were included in this study. Patients were assigned to four predefined risk groups: group I (SpO 2 /FiO 2  ≥  190 and PEEP <  10  cm H 2 O), group II (SpO 2 /FiO 2  ≥  190 and PEEP ≥  10  cm), group III (SpO 2 /FiO 2  <  190 and PEEP <  10  cm H 2 O) and group IV (SpO 2 /FiO 2  <  190 and PEEP ≥  10  cm H 2 O). Results: The analysis included 456 patients. SpO 2 /FiO 2 and PaO 2 /FiO 2 had a strong relationship (P <  0. 001, R 2  =  0. 676) that could be described in a linear regression equation (SpO 2 /FiO 2  =  42. 6  +  1. 0  * PaO 2 /FiO 2). <b>Risk</b> <b>stratification</b> at initial ARDS diagnosis resulted in groups that had no differences in in-hospital mortality. <b>Risk</b> <b>stratification</b> at 24  h resulted in groups with increasing mortality rates. The association between group assignment at 24  h and outcome was confounded by several factors, including APACHE IV scores, arterial pH and plasma lactate levels, and vasopressor therapy. Conclusions: In this cohort of patients with moderate or severe ARDS, SpO 2 /FiO 2 and PaO 2 /FiO 2 have a strong linear relationship. In contrast to <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> at initial ARDS diagnosis, <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> using SpO 2 /FiO 2 and PEEP after 24  h resulted in groups with worsening outcomes. <b>Risk</b> <b>stratification</b> using SpO 2 /FiO 2 and PEEP could be practical, especially in resource-limited settings...|$|R
