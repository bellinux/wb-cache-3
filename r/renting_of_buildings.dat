This study of profitability and cost efficiency was conducted of open shed broiler farmers in Punjab, Pakistan. Data was collected from 60 broiler respondents using proportional allocation sampling technique during February, 2014. Stochastic cost frontier function was used for analysis of data. Profitability analysis revealed that net profit in study area was PKR. 30, 830. 49 (1 USD = 99. 7 PKR). Net profit margin was 3. 99 percent and Rate of return on investment 4. 16 percent while Shepherd Futeral coefficient was 24. 06, Revenue per rupee of input cost 1. 01 and Cost benefit ratio was 1. 04. Maximum likelihood estimation revealed that cost efficiency range from 0. 425 to 0. 972 with mean efficiency of 0. 741 implies that on average farmer was 74 percent efficient in cost saving. In other words that if the most inefficient broiler farmer in the sample was to achieve the technical efficiency level of its most frontier counterpart could realize 54. 7 % per cent cost savings. Results further showed that day old chicks, feed and labor, vaccination/medication cost and <b>rent</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> was positively and significantly affected broiler production cost.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to explore the {{predictive}} power of sentiment on three market indicators (price, rent and transaction volume) in the housing market. Using an advanced causality analysis called Integrated Renormalized Partial Directed Coherence, the study focuses on the private housing market in Hong Kong during 1993 - 2012. The findings suggest that sentiment not only is a prominent indicator of price and liquidity (volume), but also provides an indirect linkage between rent and house prices in the short run. Armed with causality results, this paper further examines the effect of sentiment on the long run trend of housing market. The results explore different roles <b>of</b> sentiment in <b>rent</b> and transaction markets: sentiment affects housing price and its lagged term has an important bearing on <b>rent.</b> Department <b>of</b> <b>Building</b> and Real Estat...|$|R
