5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin sometimes forms mixed species groups with other species from the dolphin family, particularly larger species, {{such as the}} short-finned pilot whale, the false killer whale and Risso's dolphin.

25|$|In 1933, three strange {{dolphins}} beached off the Irish coast; {{they appeared}} to be hybrids between Risso's and bottlenose dolphins. This mating was later repeated in captivity, producing a hybrid calf. In captivity, a bottlenose and a <b>rough-toothed</b> <b>dolphin</b> produced hybrid offspring. A common-bottlenose hybrid lives at SeaWorld California. Other dolphin hybrids live in captivity around the world or {{have been reported in the}} wild, such as a bottlenose-Atlantic spotted hybrid. The best known hybrid is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is a fertile hybrid.

50|$|While {{there may}} be safety in their numbers, the squid are an {{important}} prey item for large fish such as tuna and sharks {{and a number of}} cetaceans: pygmy killer whales, orcas, Atlantic spotted <b>dolphins,</b> <b>rough-toothed</b> <b>dolphins,</b> and bottlenose dolphins are all known predators of slender inshore squid.

40|$|Several {{fisheries}} in Hawaii {{are known to}} have interactions with protected cetaceans, seabirds, marine turtles, or seals. Handline fisheries for bottomfish, tuna, and mackerel scad lose bait and catch to bottlenose <b>dolphins,</b> <b>rough-toothed</b> <b>dolphins,</b> and Hawaiian monk seals. Troll fisheries for billfish lose live bait to bottlenose <b>dolphins,</b> <b>rough-toothed</b> <b>dolphins,</b> albatrosses, and boobies; these fisheries may also lose catch to false killer whales. A longline fishery for tuna and billfish has burgeoned in Hawaii since 1987, resulting in interactions with protected species; marine turtles, seabirds, and monk seals take bait and are known to become hooked, and false killer whales may take catch. Research on deterrents or alternative fishing methods has been limited, and interactions have been reduced primarily through management and regulatory actions. These include area closures and gear requirements. An observer program has also been established for the bottomfish and longline fisheries...|$|R
50|$|<b>Rough-toothed</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{give birth}} to a single young, after an unknown period of gestation; it is also unknown whether or not they have a {{distinct}} breeding season.

40|$|Pan-tropical spotted {{dolphins}} (Stenella attenuata) and other cetaceans around St Helena {{in the tropical}} south-eastern Atlantic The occurrence, distribution and structure of cetacean communities in the tropical South Atlantic beyond the shelf edge are poorly known with little dedicated research occurring within this region. At 15 ° 58 'S 005 ° 43 'W, the island of St Helena {{is one of the}} few areas of land within this region and the only one that lies in the tropical south-eastern Atlantic. As a result, St Helena offers a unique opportunity to study cetaceans within this area using small boats and land-based observations. This paper describes the results of a preliminary, short-term survey of the cetacean community around St Helena in the austral winter of 2003. Pan-tropical {{spotted dolphins}} (Stenella attenuata) were the most numerous species recorded, followed by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and <b>rough-toothed</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Steno bredanensis), a species not previously reported from St Helena. This last species was only recorded occurring in mixed groups with bottlenose dolphins. Pan-tropical spotted and bottlenose dolphins differed in their spatial distribution around St Helena. While pan-tropical spotted dolphins were primarily recorded resting in large groups in the lee of the island during daylight hours, bottlenose <b>dolphins</b> and <b>rough-toothed</b> <b>dolphins</b> were recorded closer to shore and on both the windward and lee sides. Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were also recorded once during the survey, but interviews with local fishermen suggest that this species regularly occurs in the waters around St Helena in small numbers during the austral winter. The results of this preliminary survey suggest that the cetacean community around St Helena during this survey was relatively simple, consisting of up to three species that are present year-round and one seasonally occurring species in the nearshore waters, with a small number of additional species occurring occasionally in deeper offshore areas...|$|R
40|$|Several authors {{suggest that}} {{dolphins}} use information obtained by eavesdropping on echoes from sonar signals of conspecifics, {{but there is}} little evidence that this strategy is used by dolphins in the wild. Travelling <b>rough-toothed</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Steno bredanensis) either exhibit asynchronous movements or an extremely synchronized swimming behaviour in tight formations, which we expect to facilitate eavesdropping. Therefore, we determined, whether either one or more dolphins were echolocating in subgroups that were travelling with asynchronous and synchronized movements. Since, the number of recording sequences in which more than one animal produced sonar signals was significantly lower during synchronized travel, we conclude that the other members of a subgroup might get information on targets ahead by eavesdropping. Synchronized swimming in tight formations might be an energetic adaptation for travelling in a pelagic dolphin species that facilitates eavesdropping...|$|R
50|$|Dolphins and {{porpoises}} {{are kept}} in captivity. Bottlenose dolphins are the most common, as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and have a friendly appearance.
