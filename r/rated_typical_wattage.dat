The dimensions examined were (1) preferences for dyadic or group situations, (2) whether children who are friends with a given target child are likely to be friends with each other, and (3) perceptions of the probability of knowing information about friends. Participants from preschool; grades 2, 6, 8, and 10; and college (N � 278) were asked questions about typical girls and boys. Results indicate that both girls and boys (1) <b>rate</b> <b>typical</b> boys as preferring group interactions more than do typical girls, a difference present as early as preschool; (2) <b>rate</b> <b>typical</b> boys as more likely than typical girls to be friends with one another if they are friends with the same target boy or gir,l respectively; and (3) <b>rate</b> <b>typical</b> girls as more likely than typical boys to know certain types of information about friends.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{original}} {{design of the}} TCP retransmission timeout was implemented ignoring the recent measurement studies on the dynamics and features of network traffic and delay. Such studies have reported the highly variable characteristics of network delay, considered to be heavy-tailed distributed. Accordingly, depending on the heavy characteristics of {{the tail of the}} delay distribution, the actual implementation of TCP's retransmission timeout might be too conservative, or rather insufficient. This work aims to assess the optimal design of the retransmission timeout when heavy-tailed delay profiles are present. In our experiments, we have considered the case of low-bit error <b>rate</b> scenarios <b>typical</b> from wired networks as well as the high bit-error <b>rates,</b> <b>typical</b> from wireless networks.

Tadpoles of Litoria genimaculata and Mixophyes schevilli {{are restricted to}} habitats {{with little or no}} water flow, and L. nannotis and Nyctimystes dayi occur only in rapidly flowing and turbulent riffle habitats. The abilities of L. genimaculata, M. schevilli and L. nannotis to resist flow <b>rates</b> <b>typical</b> of riffle habitats were compared in a laboratory flow chamber and in an artificial riffle in the field. In the flow chamber, large tadpoles of L. genimaculata were more resistant to flow rates of 25 cm/s than were smaller individuals, but at 50 cm/s all tadpoles were dislodged irrespective of size. Large M. schevilli tadpoles were significantly more resistant than were smaller individuals only at the fastest flow rate. Large (> 25 mm body length) M. schevilli were resistant to the highest tested flow rates (50 cm/s), but in an artificial riffle with turbulence typical of a riffle both Litoria genimaculata and Mixophyes schevilli were rapidly dislodged irrespective of their size. Fast water speeds had little impact on L. nannotis in the flow chamber or in the artificial riffle. Litoria nannotis and other tadpoles living in riffles have evolved a range of morphological and behavioural traits that minimize exposure to, and maximize resistance to, fast-flowing turbulent water within these habitats. The results {{of this study indicate that}} L. genimaculata and M. schevilli cannot live in riffles because they are unable to withstand the flow <b>rates</b> <b>typical</b> of these habitats...|$|R
