In 866 Emperor Louis II gave the island to the comune of Amalfi. The political dependence of Capri to Amalfi, which had relations to the Eastern Mediterranean, is particularly evident in art and architecture, in which Byzantine and Islamic forms appeared. In 987 Pope John XV consecrated the first Caprese bishop.|$|R

5|$|After basic {{education}} in Greek with a tutor known as Alexe, Ion Heliade Rădulescu taught himself reading in Romanian Cyrillic (reportedly {{by studying the}} Alexander Romance {{with the help of}} his father's Oltenian servants). He subsequently became an avid reader of popular novels, especially during his 1813 sojourn in Gârbovi (where he had been sent after other areas of the country came to be <b>ravaged</b> <b>by</b> Caragea's plague). After 1813, the teenaged Rădulescu was a pupil of the Orthodox monk Naum Râmniceanu; in 1815, he moved on to the Greek school at Schitu Măgureanu, in Bucharest, and, in 1818, to the Saint Sava School, where he studied under Gheorghe Lazăr's supervision.|$|E

5|$|Battle for Zendikar was {{a return}} to the plane of Zendikar, which had been <b>ravaged</b> <b>by</b> the Eldrazi horrors. This marks a change in Magics storytelling, where each block's story is shown from the {{perspective}} of a group of planeswalkers called the Gatewatch. Shadows Over Innistrad is {{a return to}} Innistrad, where Avacyn has been corrupted. The next set, Eldritch Moon, focuses on the fact that Emrakul, the most powerful Eldrazi titan who had been missing from the Battle for Zendikar storyline, is now on Innistrad. Together, the Gatewatch must find a way to save the plane from Emrakul's influence. This story also focuses on cosmic horror instead of the traditional gothic horror of old Innistrad.|$|E
5|$|Mysts story {{concerns}} {{an explorer}} named Atrus {{who has the}} ability to write books which serve as links to other worlds, known as Ages.

The player takes the role of an unnamed person referred to as the Stranger and assists Atrus by traveling to other Ages and solving puzzles. Over the course of the series Atrus writes a new Age for the D'ni survivors to live on, and players of the games set the course the civilization will follow.|$|E

On June 28, however, the Muslims {{defeated}} King Baldwin I of Jerusalem's army at the Battle of Al-Sannabra.

50|$|The Saxon town survived many invasions and <b>ravages</b> <b>by</b> the Danes but {{eventually}} fell into decline {{and in the}} time of King Canute in the 11th century the population moved to the safety of the Norman medieval settlement to the west, with St. Michael's Church being first built in 1070. However, St. Mary's continued to be of significant importance as the Mother Church, with its claims to tithes, burial rights and privileges reflecting its status. A document of 1281 appears to confirm the status of St. Mary's as a collegiate church and as the principal church of Southampton.|$|R
5|$|The Uruguayan War (10 August 1864– 20 February 1865) {{was fought}} between Uruguay's {{governing}} Blanco Party and an alliance {{consisting of the}} Empire of Brazil and the Uruguayan Colorado Party, covertly supported by Argentina. Since its independence, Uruguay had been <b>ravaged</b> <b>by</b> intermittent struggles between the Colorado and Blanco factions, each attempting to seize and maintain power in turn. The Colorado leader Venancio Flores launched the Liberating Crusade in 1863, an insurrection aimed at toppling Bernardo Berro, who presided over a Colorado–Blanco coalition (fusionist) government. Flores was aided by Argentina, whose president Bartolomé Mitre provided him with supplies, Argentine volunteers and river transport for troops.|$|E

5|$|The {{restoration}} {{of relations with}} Galicia had an immediate benefit for Manuel when, in 1166, he dispatched two armies to attack the eastern provinces of Hungary in a vast pincer movement. One army crossed the Walachian Plain and entered Hungary through the Transylvanian Alps (Southern Carpathians), while the other army made a wide circuit to Galicia and, with Galician aid, crossed the Carpathian Mountains. Since the Hungarians had most of their forces concentrated on the Sirmium and Belgrade frontier, they were caught off guard by the Byzantine invasion; this resulted in the Hungarian province of Transylvania being thoroughly <b>ravaged</b> <b>by</b> the Byzantine armies.|$|E

50|$|After {{the end of}} the Western Roman Empire, Capri {{returned}} to the status of a dominion of Naples, and suffered various attacks and <b>ravages</b> <b>by</b> pirates. In 866 Emperor Louis II gave the island to Amalfi. In 987 Pope John XV consecrated the first bishop of Capri, when Capri, Scala, Minori, and Lettere were made dioceses to serve as suffragans of Amalfi, which thereby became a metropolitan see. Capri continued to be a residential diocese until 1818, when the island became part of the archdiocese of Sorrento. No longer a residential bishopric, Capri, Capreae in Latin, is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.|$|R

As so many of his followers had also brought home money after their voyage, the work of rebuilding and restoration went on rapidly, and in a few months the marks left of the <b>ravages</b> <b>by</b> the Danes had been well-nigh effaced.|$|R
5|$|When he {{ascended to}} the throne, Pedro II was {{only five years}} old. Until he came of age and {{would be able to}} exert his {{constitutional}} powers, a regency was created. It proved to be weak and to have little effective authority, which led the nation into anarchy, <b>ravaged</b> <b>by</b> political faction struggles and countless rebellions. Exploited as a tool by rival political factions in pursuit of their own interests, Pedro II was manipulated into accepting an early elevation to majority status on 22 July 1840 at age 14, thus putting an end to nine years of chaotic regency rule.|$|E
5|$|Along {{the east}} coast of Florida, the most severe damage was {{reported}} from Miami to Fort Pierce, particularly in Palm Beach County. In West Palm Beach, one of the most severely affected coastal cities, a total of 1,711houses were destroyed and 6,369 others suffered damage, which left about 2,100families homeless. Additionally, the hurricane demolished 268businesses and affected 490others. There were four deaths, and severe damage totaling just under $13.8 million (1928USD). At Palm Beach, which had many houses owned by wealthy individuals, approximately 1,500houses and 500businesses were destroyed. Damage totaled around $10million. Inland, many communities on the southern and eastern shores of Lake Okeechobee, such as the cities of Belle Glade, Canal Point, Chosen, Miami Locks (today Lake Harbor), Pahokee, and South Bay, were <b>ravaged</b> <b>by</b> flooding after storm surge resulted in water pouring out of the shallow lake over the small dikes. Numerous structures were swept away or destroyed, and at least 2,500people drowned. Overall, the hurricane left at least $25million in damage.|$|E

The Indians had been provoked to attack the settlement of the monks because of the repeated slave raids by Spaniards operating from Cubagua. As Ocampo's ships began returning with slaves from the land Las Casas had been granted, he went to Hispaniola to complain to the Audiencia. After several months of negotiations Las Casas set sail alone; the peasants he had brought had deserted, and he arrived in his colony already <b>ravaged</b> <b>by</b> Spaniards.|$|E
