5000|$|The Curta {{calculator}} {{used the}} method of complements for subtraction, and managed to hide this from the user. Numbers were entered using digit input slides {{along the side of}} the device. The number on each slide was added to a result counter by a gearing mechanism which engaged cams on a rotating [...] "echelon drum" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "step drum"). The drum was turned by use of a crank on the top of the instrument. The number of cams encountered by each digit as the crank turned was determined by the value of that digit. For example, if a slide is set to its [...] "6" [...] position, a row of 6 cams would be encountered around the drum corresponding to that position. For subtraction, the drum was shifted slightly before it was turned, which moved a different row of cams into position. This alternate row contained the nines' complement of the digits. Thus, the row of 6 cams that had been in position for addition now had a row with 3 cams. The shifted drum also engaged one extra cam which added 1 to the result (as required for {{the method of}} complements). The always present tens' complement [...] "overflow 1" [...] which carried out beyond the most significant digit of the <b>results</b> <b>register</b> was, in effect, discarded.|$|E

We discuss methods of circumventing the implementation {{problems inherent in}} such late register assignment. 1 Introduction Higher-level languages permitting abstraction from lowlevel timing and concurrency details are a major step toward alleviating the problem of mapping complex applications onto complex architectures. However, this approach is useful only if compilers for these languages can produce high-quality code and can be reliably targeted to new machines with modest effort. The ROCKET compiler, a retargetable C compiler for Long-Instruction-Word (LIW) and pipelined architectures, strives to meet these criteria. A high-level language compiler must include mappings from programmer-defin [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The IEEE 802. 3 aq {{standard}} {{recommends a}} multi-tap decision feedback equalizer be implemented to remove inter-symbol interference and additive system noise from data transmitted over a 10 Gigabit per Second (10 Gbps) multi-mode fiber-optic link (MMF). The recommended implementation produces a design in an analog process. This design process is difficult, time consuming, and is expensive to modify if first pass silicon success is not achieved. Performing {{the majority of}} the design in a well-characterized digital process with stable, evolutionary tools reduces the technical risk. ASIC design rule checking is more predictable than custom tools flows and produces regular, repeatable <b>results.</b> <b>Register</b> Transfer Language (RTL) changes can also be relatively quickly implemented when compared to the custom flow. However, standard cell methodologies are expected to achieve clock rates of roughly one-tenth of the corresponding analog process. The architecture and design for a parallel linear equalizer and decision feedback equalizer are presented. The presented design demonstrates an RTL implementation of 10 GHz filters operating in parallel at 625 MHz. The performance of the filters is characterized by testing the design against a set of 324 reference channels. The results are compared against the IEEE standard group s recommended implementation. The linear equalizer design of 20 taps equalizes 88 % of the reference channels. The decision feedback equalizer design of 20 forward and 1 reverse tap equalizes 93 % of the reference channels. Analysis of the unequalized channels in performed, and areas for continuing research are presented. Ph. D.

50|$|Processors that perform {{register}} renaming {{can arrange}} for each functional unit {{to write to}} {{a subset of the}} physical register file.

The <b>resulting</b> <b>register</b> file, effectively a stack of register files with single write ports, then benefits from replication and subsetting the read ports. At the limit, this technique would place a stack of 1-write, 2-read regfiles at the inputs to each functional unit. Since regfiles with a small number of ports are often dominated by transistor area, it is best not to push this technique to this limit, but it is useful all the same.|$|R
