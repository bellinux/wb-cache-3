25|$|Robots {{are used}} {{extensively}} in industrial engineering. They allow businesses {{to save money}} on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so <b>robotized</b> that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.|$|E

However, producing increasingly individualized products with an enhanced number of variants, {{the flexibility of}} the production system poses substantial challenges in order to <b>robotize</b> manual tasks. Comprehensive scientific research is required to provide tailored solutions for these manufacturing processes. This is true especially for small and medium sized companies (SME). The key note discusses the challenges of automating flexible manufacturing operations with examples from specific use cases with industrial background. We present automotive powertrain assembly, which requires agile robotic joining of rigid and complaint parts. However, as automation of many low volume processes is economically not advantageous, semi-automation and Human-Robot Collaboration are key enablers for <b>robotizing</b> small lot production. Human-Robot Collaboration requires novel technologies for dynamic workload distribution between worker and robot.

The new 1.8-litre 2ZR-FE Dual VVT-i - with variable valve timing for both intake and exhaust camshafts - will be the only engine available for the Australian model, promising better fuel economy than before, it also regains its 100kW power output.

40|$|While Autonomous Weapons Systems have obvious {{military}} advantages, {{there are}} prima facie moral objections to using them. By way of general reply to these objections, I point out {{similarities between the}} structure of law and morality {{on the one hand}} and of automata on the other. I argue that these, plus the fact that automata can be designed to lack the biases and other failings of humans, require us to automate the formulation, administration, and enforcement of law as much as possible, including the elements of law and morality that are operated by combatants in war. I suggest that, ethically speaking, deploying a legally competent robot in some legally regulated realm is not much different from deploying a more or less well-armed, vulnerable, obedient, or morally discerning soldier or general into battle, a police officer onto patrol, or a lawyer or judge into a trial. All feature automaticity in the sense of deputation to an agent we do not then directly control. Such relations are well understood and well-regulated in morality and law; so there is not much challenging philosophically in having robots be some of these agents — excepting the implications of the limits of robot technology at a given time for responsible deputation. I then consider this proposal in light of the differences between two conceptions of law. These are distinguished by whether each conception sees law as unambiguous rules inherently uncontroversial in each application; and I consider the prospects for <b>robotizing</b> law on each. Likewise for the prospects of <b>robotizing</b> moral theorizing and moral decision-making. Finally I identify certain elements of law and morality, noted by the philosopher Immanuel Kant, which robots can participate in only upon being able to set ends and emotionally invest in their attainment. One conclusion is that while affectless autonomous devices might be fit to rule us, they would not be fit to vote with us. For voting is a process for summing felt preferences, and affectless devices would have none to weigh into the sum. Since they don't care which outcomes obtain, they don't get to vote on which ones to bring about...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Remote {{locations}} such as ultra-deep water reservoirs (400 m or deeper) {{have been}} increasing the production complexity and logistic costs for Oil & Gas industry.

In this paper we present the use of virtual reality techniques in a robotics framework, SimUEP-Robotics (Robotics Simulator for Stationary Production Units), aimed to enable planning the offshore platform <b>robotizing.</b> SimUEP-Robotics has an integrated Virtual Reality Engine specially tailored to provide realistic visualization of large offshore scene models in an immersive environment.

Similar to {{what we see in}} today's audio systems, the DSA concept allows the design of dedicated narrowband source elements that do not suffer from the low versus high frequency compromise. In addition, the DSA concept opens the possibility to use source depths and spatial sampling intervals that are optimum for the low-, mid-, and high-frequency sources (multiscale shooting grids).

The swimming trajectory, speed, and force of algae cells were analyzed in detail. Then the algae cell could be controlled to swim back and forth, and traverse a crossroad as a microrobot obeying specific traffic rules. Furthermore, their motions along arbitrarily set trajectories such as zigzag, and triangle were realized successfully under optical control. <b>Robotize</b> algae cells can be used to precisely transport and deliver cargo such as drug particles in microfluidic chip for biomedical treatment and pharmacodynamic analysis.

40|$|Mining {{companies}} and equipment manufacturers are pursuing improved efficiency, productivity, and safety in {{underground mining operations}} by <b>robotizing</b> some of the functions of underground vehicles. For example, the repetitive “load-haul-dump ” cycle is well suited to automation. In this case, a vehicle called a load-haul-dump (LHD) machine {{is often used to}} excavate fragmented rock, haul it to an assigned location, and then dump the material before returning for another load (see Figure 1). These vehicles are traditionally driven manually by an operator on the vehicle, and more recently by radio remote and teleoperation [1]. However, the hazardous nature of underground environments, driver safety and fatigue, labor costs, and the cyclic nature of this task are all motivations to seek an autonomous tramming solution. Early “autotramming ” attempts worked by outfitting the mine with signalemitting cables [2], light-emitting ropes [1], or retroreflective tape [3], which allowed a vehicle to find its way through tunnels by tracking the installed infrastructure. Other systems have used fixed beacons, placed strategically throughout the mine [4]. Existing infrastructureless systems have typically employed a suite of sensors for estimating the vehicle’s state with respect to its environment and with reference to some form of topological map.
