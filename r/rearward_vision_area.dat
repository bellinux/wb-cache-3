2500|$|While SUVs {{are often}} {{perceived}} as having inferior <b>rearward</b> <b>vision</b> compared with regular passenger cars, {{this is not}} supported by controlled testing which found poor rearward visibility {{was not limited to}} any single vehicle class. Australia's NRMA motoring organisation found that regular passenger cars commonly provided inferior <b>rearward</b> <b>vision</b> compared to SUVs, both because of the prevalence of reversing cameras on modern SUVs and the shape of many popular passenger cars, with their high rear window lines and boots (trunks) obstructing <b>rearward</b> <b>vision.</b> In NRMA testing, two out of 42 SUVs (5%) and 29 out of 163 (18%) regular cars had the worst rating (>15-metre blind spot). Of the vehicles that received a perfect 0-metre blind spot rating, 11 out of 42 (26%) were SUVs and eight out of 163 (5%) were regular passenger cars. All of the [...] "perfect score" [...] vehicles had OEM reversing cameras.|$|R
2500|$|Larger {{vehicles}} {{can create}} visibility problems for other road users by obscuring {{their view of}} traffic lights, signs, and other vehicles on the road, plus the road itself. Depending on the design, drivers of some larger vehicles may themselves suffer from poor visibility {{to the side and}} the rear. Poor <b>rearward</b> <b>vision</b> has led to many [...] "backover deaths" [...] where vehicles have run over small children when backing out of driveways. The problem of backover deaths has become so widespread that reversing cameras are being installed on some vehicles to improve <b>rearward</b> <b>vision.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1929, {{fourteen}} Class S locomotives {{were placed}} in service. They were built by Henschel and Son in Germany, designed to SAR specifications. The top sides of the tender’s coal bunker were set inwards and the water tank top was rounded to improve the crew’s <b>rearward</b> <b>vision.</b>|$|R
50|$|Flight {{testing was}} carried out {{under the aegis of}} the Luftwaffe and despite the good performance, the prone {{position}} was found to be unsatisfactory, being uncomfortable and restricting <b>rearward</b> <b>vision.</b> The programme was halted by the German control Commission that was running weapons production in the Repubblica Sociale Italiana - RSI after the 1943 armistice.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} of {{the three}} orders were visually distinguishable from one another. The first two orders were mechanically identical, but the second batch had redesigned water tanks with rounded top corners and inset tops on their coal bunkers to improve <b>rearward</b> <b>vision</b> for the crew. They also had slightly smaller firebox and superheater heating areas than the engines of the first batch.|$|R
50|$|The Class S {{locomotives}} were superheated, {{were built}} on bar frames and used Walschaerts valve gear with piston valves. They were delivered with Type GT tenders with a fuel capacity of 8 lt t, a water capacity of 6000 imp gal {{and a maximum}} axle load of 15 lt 19 lcwt 2 qtr kg. To improve the crew's <b>rearward</b> <b>vision,</b> the top sides of the tender's coal bunker were set inwards and the water tank top was rounded.|$|R
50|$|The tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 8 lt t, a water {{capacity of}} 6000 imp gal {{and a maximum}} axle load of 15 lt 19 lcwt 2 qtr kg. To improve the crew's <b>rearward</b> <b>vision,</b> the top sides of the tender's coal bunker were set inwards {{and the top of}} the water tank was rounded. An unusual characteristic for a tender was a frame which extended behind the water tank to form a platform, equipped with handrails for use by shunting crew.|$|R
50|$|The tender was {{arranged}} for manual stoking {{and had a}} coal capacity of 11 lt t and a water capacity of 6000 imp gal. As on the Type GT tender of the Class S shunting locomotive, the top sides of its coal bunker were set inwards to improve the crew's <b>rearward</b> <b>vision.</b> The front of the engine {{and the back of}} the tender were fitted with modified and strengthened draft gear and both were fitted with vacuum brakes. It was built with an underframe and bogies identical to those of the Type JT tender.|$|R
5|$|Another {{criticism}} from locomotive crews concerned the exposed cab in bad weather, which necessitated {{the installation of}} a tarpaulin sheet over {{the rear of the}} cab and the front of the tender, restricting <b>rearward</b> <b>vision.</b> The 1921 Coal Miners’ strike meant that two class members (Nos.737 and 739) were converted to oil-burning. One of the modified locomotives subsequently caught fire at Salisbury shed, and both were reverted to coal firing {{by the end of the}} year. When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923, Urie had done little to remedy the shortcomings of the N15s, and it fell to his successor to improve the class.|$|R
50|$|Jaguar's {{manufacturing}} {{timing was}} not good; {{the car was}} launched {{in the wake of}} a fuel crisis, and the market for a 5.3-litre V12 grand tourer was very small. The styling was also criticised, including the buttresses behind the windows. German authorities feared these would restrict <b>rearward</b> <b>vision,</b> and refused to give the XJ-S, and the similarly adorned Lancia Montecarlo, type approval: it was for a time necessary instead for German XJS buyers to obtain road approval for each individual car when registering it. Such fears were ill-founded, since in reality the rear visibility was very reasonable, with only the frontmost top edges of the buttresses being visible when looking rearward.|$|R
5000|$|The {{front end}} of the 1951 Lincoln looked like a 1950 model that had gotten into a fight, and lost. The grille bar only {{extended}} from the center section to the bumper guards, while a forward slanting vertical piece was added to the front fender side chrome. [...] The 1951 Mercury's [...] "fishtail" [...] rear design was also adopted, to the detriment of rearward visibility(*). The glamorous Lido coupe returned with a canvas or vinyl roof, fender skirts, rocker panel molding and custom interior.(*)Other than here, there is no reference to a Mercury [...] "fish tail" [...] design. The '51 Lincoln's modified C pillar actually increased <b>rearward</b> <b>vision.</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{trucks and}} buses the load often blocks <b>rearward</b> <b>vision</b> out the backlight. In the U.S. {{virtually}} all trucks and buses have a side view mirror on each side, often {{mounted on the}} doors and viewed out the side windows, which are used for rear vision. These mirrors leave a large unviewable (“blind”) area behind the vehicle, which tapers down as the distance increases. This is a safety issue which the driver must compensate for, often with a person guiding the truck back in congested areas, or by backing in a curve. “Spot mirrors”, a convex mirror which provides a distorted image of the entire side of the vehicle, are commonly mounted on at least {{the right side of}} a vehicle. In the U.S. mirrors are considered “safety equipment”, and are not included in width restrictions.|$|R
50|$|The Scarab's {{interior}} space was maximized by its ponton styling, which dispensed with running boards and expanded the cabin {{to the full}} width of the car. A long wheelbase and engine placement directly over the rear axle moved the driver forward, enabling a steering wheel almost directly above the front wheels. Passengers entered through a single, large, common door. A flexible seating system could be easily reconfigured (except for the driver's seat, which was fixed). Anticipating the seating in modern minivans, such as the Chrysler Voyager and Renault Espace, a small card table which could be fitted with the passenger seats as needed. Interiors were appointed in leather, chrome, and wood. Design elements also worked in a stylized ancient Egyptian scarab motif, including the car's emblem. Visibility {{to the front and}} sides was similar to that of an observation car, although <b>rearward</b> <b>vision</b> was negligible and there were no rear-view mirrors.|$|R

50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Nymph was a plywood covered box {{formed with}} frames and stringers, with inward sloping sides, a central keel from nose to mid fuselage and an upper turtleback or semi-conical decking behind the wing trailing edge. The cockpit {{was ahead of}} the leading edge, with a single piece, blown perspex side opening canopy and an upper line that merged into the wing. On each side a secondary, D-shaped window gave some <b>rearward</b> <b>vision.</b> The Nymph's ply covered, straight tapered, horizontal tail was unusually far back {{on top of the}} fuselage, locating the tailplane, also ply skinned, aft of the fin with the elevators largely behind the rudder which ended above them. Its starboard elevator carried a trim tab. The vertical tail was straight edged, tapered and flat topped. There was an unsprung monowheel below the wing at about one third chord, semi-recessed into a rubber sprung skid which reached from the nose to the trailing edge. The Nymph without wing endplates also had its wheel mounted a little further forward and its skid removed. There was a miniature skid tail bumper rather than the usual cantilever tailskid.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the cockpit}} was {{directly}} in front of the fuselage, the pilot had no direct view to the rear, so the guns were aimed through a periscope, derived from the type used on German World War II tanks, mounted on the cockpit roof. The defensive fixed rear gun system intended for the Ar 234A's prototype series was generally considered useless — much like similar rearward-firing, fuselage mount guns placed on the fuselage of the first five prototypes of the Heinkel He 219 night fighter — and such fixed, rearwards-mount machine guns were omitted in production examples of the Ar 234B, while still retaining the periscope for <b>rearwards</b> <b>vision.</b> The external bombload, and the aforementioned presence of inactive aircraft littering the landing field after their missions were completed (as with the similarly dolly/skid-geared Messerschmitt Me 163) made the skid-landing system impractical, so the B version was modified to have fully retractable tricycle landing gear, with the mid-fuselage very slightly widened to accommodate the forward-retracting main gear units, the nosegear retracting rearwards. The ninth prototype, marked with Stammkennzeichen (radio code letters) PH+SQ, was the prototype Ar 234B, and flew on 10 March 1944.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} tenders {{were built}} as flat-sided box-shaped vehicles. A second tender version was delivered with the later batches of locomotives, with the coal bunker sides set inward for reasons unknown. The new shape {{made no difference}} to the crew's <b>rearward</b> field of <b>vision</b> and the only likely benefit was a reduced axle load {{as a result of}} the reduced coal capacity.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, Quill was {{in charge}} of {{development}} and production flying at Vickers Supermarine, a job that he took so seriously that he felt he must obtain first-hand combat experience. Following the fall of France in 1940, he was determined to rejoin a fighter squadron. Forestalling opposition from his employers at Vickers Supermarine, he successfully argued the need to gain front-line operational experience and was temporarily released on 5 August 1940 to join No. 65 Squadron at RAF Hornchurch, privately hoping {{that it would be a}} permanent appointment. On 16 August he shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 109 and two days later he shared a victory over a Heinkel He 111. His combat days were short-lived because he was recalled after nineteen days to test the Spitfire Mk III, but they made Quill all the more determined to make the Spitfire an even better fighting machine, and his experiences in the Battle of Britain led to two important changes in the Spitfire. At high speed, the stick force from the ailerons had been very heavy, and this was found to be caused by the ballooning of the fabric covering of the ailerons, and so causing a thicker trailing edge section. This was cured by fitting stiffer, metal-covered ailerons. Quill also initiated an improvement in the optical quality of the cockpit side panels. His concerns about <b>rearward</b> <b>vision</b> from the cockpit led to changes and improvements to the canopy and rear fuselage. Later in 1940 he became chief test pilot for Vickers Armstrongs (Supermarine) Works.|$|R
50|$|While {{the tender}} was similar in general {{appearance}} and dimensions {{and had the}} same wheelbase as the Type MY tender of the Class 24, it had a different coal bunker top design. As {{was done with the}} tenders of the Classes S and S1 shunting locomotives, the top sides of the coal bunker were scalloped out to improve the crew's <b>rearward</b> field of <b>vision.</b>|$|R
30|$|Most DR {{methods that}} use {{multiple}} viewpoints are premises that cameras are fixed in space. The use of fiducial markers is one {{solution to this}} problem although the markers themselves should also be targets to be removed in DR. Allowing cameras to move freely in the 3 D space makes a more flexible DR system; we need to tackle challenges known to be difficult in computer graphics and computer <b>vision</b> <b>areas</b> (e.g., artifacts accompanying viewpoint changes in IBR, real-time synchronization, and online multiple camera calibrations).|$|R
