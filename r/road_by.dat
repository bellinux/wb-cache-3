5|$|A station {{house is}} located above both platforms, {{containing}} a crossover, waiting area and fare control.

This platform also has a set of exit-only turnstiles leading directly to this staircase so riders exiting the station on this side {{do not have to}} go through the station house. The station house is heated, while the platforms feature passenger-activated heaters; these heaters, and the doors separating the station house and staircases, were not originally part of the station. The station house used to have 1950s-era signage at its front entrance reading, but now only has modern MTA entrance signs.|$|E

5|$|Andy Hawkins lost a game on July 1, 1990 to the Chicago White Sox {{while on}} the <b>road</b> <b>by</b> the score of 4–0 without {{allowing}} a hit. Because the White Sox were winning entering the ninth inning at home, they did not bat, and thus Hawkins pitched only 8 innings, but the game was considered a no-hitter at the time. However, following rules changes in 1991, the game is no longer counted as a no-hitter. Additionally, Tom L. Hughes held the Cleveland Indians without a hit through the first nine innings of a game on August 6, 1910 but the game went into extra innings and he lost the no-hitter in the tenth inning and ultimately lost the game 5–0.|$|E

Jourdan distributed them in three columns, the strongest on the post <b>road</b> <b>by</b> Saulgau, another {{on the road in}} the direction of Altshausen, and a third at the hamlet of Friedberg.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increase}} in motor traffic in the early 20th century, the capacity of the original tunnel was soon perceived as inadequate. In 1930, John Mills, MP for Dartford, remarked that HGVs delivering from Essex to Kent could not practically use any crossing of the Thames downstream of the tunnel. The LCC obtained an act to construct a new tunnel in 1938, but work did not start due to the outbreak of World War II. Construction eventually started in 1958 with preliminary work on the northern approach <b>road.</b> <b>By</b> this time, traffic had become progressively worse. In 1960, Richard Marsh, MP for Greenwich complained that vehicles could spend 30 to 45 minutes stuck in tunnel traffic.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lauderdale's {{first major}} {{development}} {{began in the}} 1920s, during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. The 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused {{a great deal of}} economic dislocation. In July 1935, an African-American man named Rubin Stacy was accused of robbing a white woman at knife point. He was arrested and being transported to a Miami jail when police were run off the <b>road</b> <b>by</b> a mob. A group of 100 white men proceeded to hang Stacy from a tree near the scene of his alleged robbery. His body was riddled with some twenty bullets. The murder was subsequently used by the press in Nazi Germany to discredit US critiques of its own persecution of Jews, Communists, and Catholics.|$|E

5|$|In 1818 a {{golf course}} was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club, a group of Manchester businessmen, {{some of whom had}} emigrated from Scotland. This was only the second course to be built outside Scotland. The course at that time {{consisted}} of only five holes and had no fairways or greens as the players had to share the ground with other users. The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club house had been built on Singleton <b>Road.</b> <b>By</b> 1869 the course had increased to nine holes and the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a new course was built a few hundred yards away at Kersal Vale.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Ipswich became {{founder members}} of the Southern Amateur League. The club {{narrowly}} avoided relegation {{in many of the}} following seasons, and suffered a club record 15–1 defeat {{at the hands of the}} Corinthians at Portman Road on New Year's Day, 1910. The outbreak of the First World War and the commandeering of Portman <b>Road</b> <b>by</b> the Army curtailed the 1914–15 season and organised football did not return until the 1920–21 season. Just one year later, Ipswich Town became champions of the Southern Amateur League, clinching the title on the last day of the season. The club won the league a further three times, in 1929–30, 1932–33 and 1933–34, before becoming founder {{members of the}} Eastern Counties Football League at the end of the 1934–35 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, after {{receiving}} {{approval from the}} government, the Parks Commission began to expropriate land {{along the length of}} the river. The broadened strip of land was used to construct a new paved parkway, which was opened in segments. The new parkway was ornamental and designed to be aesthetically pleasing, a prime consideration of road construction at that time. The section south of the falls was completed first, opening in 1912. It was extended north to the Whirlpool Rapids, incorporating the existing River <b>Road,</b> <b>by</b> 1915. The section between the rapids and Queenston was opened between 1921 and 1923. Finally, the remaining section between Queenston and Niagara-on-the-Lake opened in 1931, completing the present parkway.|$|E
