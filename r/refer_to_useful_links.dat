A family of defeasible reasoning patterns is used <b>to</b> provide a <b>useful</b> <b>link</b> between {{dispute resolution}} agents and legal doctrines. The proposed argumentation framework combines defeasible logic with temporal reasoning and argumentation with level of certainty. The evaluation of arguments depends {{on the stage of}} the dispute: commencement, discovery, pre-trial, arbitration, according to current practice in law. By applying the open world assumption to the rules, the argumentative semantics of defeasible logic is enriched with three types of negated rules which offer symmetrical means of argumentation for both disputants. A corollary of this extension consists in defining a specialized type of undercutting defeater. The theory is illustrated {{with the help of a}} concrete business-to-client case in a partially implemented system. ...|$|R

Figure 5 illustrates the idea of Algorithm 3, where the useful and the interference path loss links are shown for a particular D 2 D candidate pair and a cellular UE in a specific Monte Carlo drop. The <b>useful</b> path loss <b>links</b> are denoted with bold black arrows (g 1 and g 2), while the interference path loss links (g 3 and g 4) are marked with dashed blue arrows. The algorithm first calculates hypothetical SNR values for each link according to Step 1 – 4. The proposed algorithm selects D 2 D mode for the D 2 D candidate if the <b>useful</b> <b>links</b> (g 1 and g 2) are stronger than the interfering links (g 3 and g 4). More specifically, D 2 D mode is selected if the hypothetical capacity values corresponding <b>to</b> the <b>useful</b> <b>links</b> are higher than the hypothetical capacity values corresponding to the interfering links plus a Δ value (see Step 5 of Algorithm 3), which is a tunable system parameter measured in bit/sec/Hz. The transmit power value p in Step 1)– 4) is set to an arbitrary positive value. By increasing Δ, the MS algorithm becomes more conservative and selects D 2 D communication more cautiously. Selecting a negative Δ implies a more frequent D 2 D MS. This algorithm is not a network-wise optimization {{in the sense that it}} uses only single cell slow fading (distance dependent path loss and shadowing) information to determine the communication mode of a cell. An important feature of this algorithm is that it meets Requirement 4 by relying on SNR rather than SINR metrics.|$|R
