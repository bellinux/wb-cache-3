The focus is the integration of a real option approach for project investment timing and financial carbon option approach for carbon credit management. The real option is for a mid or long term decision on when to invest on the environmental project, and the financial option is for a supplementary decision to hedge short-term <b>residue</b> <b>risks.</b> Two uncertainties (the carbon price and carbon credit demand) are considered, and their changes are represented by a lattice of multiple orders.

40|$|Australia exports a major {{proportion}} of its agricultural production and is {{highly dependent on}} maintaining and developing access to, and competitiveness in, export markets. To preserve Australia’s status as a provider of high quality grain, the majority of Australian primary producers rely on pesticides to protect their crops from pests and diseases, particularly in post-harvest situations. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) supports Australian agriculture by registering and allowing the supply of safe and effective animal health and crop protection products. A <b>residue</b> <b>risk</b> management continuum is established when the effectiveness of chemical registration and control of chemical use regulations is assessed through residue monitoring programs. Programs assess good agricultural practice and provide traceback capacity to investigate areas of concern. Risk communication provides opportunities for continuous improvement. In the early 1960 s, the Australian Government established a non-regulatory body, the national residue survey (NRS). In 2008 - 2009, random monitoring programs were conducted for over 50 commodities (21 grains, five horticultural commodities, 11 fish species, 12 animal species, honey and egg with over 20, 000 samples collected for analytical testing. The NRS grain residue monitoring program {{is presented as a}} case study of the <b>residue</b> <b>risk</b> management continuum demonstrating to overseas markets the high level of residue integrity of Australian grain. Over 4, 000 grain samples are collected and analysed per annum. Most of the samples are collected in the bulk export program where samples are collected from every hatch of every ship loaded at the seventeen Australian grain export terminals. The chemical screens have expanded beyond the multi-residue screen (MRS) insecticides, fungicides and herbicides, to include phosphine, additional herbicides (not included in the MRS), heavy metals and mycotoxins. In its current form, the NRS grains program provides 15 years of residue testing data which demonstrates a very high degree of conformance with Australian MRLs and the import tolerances of overseas trading partners. In addition, trends in residue testing data demonstrate a decline in the frequency of residue detections and the levels of residue detected. To be confident that residue testing results meet the requisite standards, the reliability of the Australian analyses must be assured. The NRS laboratory performance evaluation system has been developed to provide that assurance, using a range of proficiency tests and other techniques in the selection of laboratories for NRS work. Residue testing results are reported against both Australian MRLs and the international MRLs which apply in the relevant export market. NRS maintains databases of overseas MRLs and compares its residue testing results of exported commodities against those standards. Grain marketers receive certificates of analysis, in the form of NRS residue testing results, for each shipment prior to arrival at the overseas market...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} serum organochlorine pesticide <b>residues</b> and <b>risk</b> of gallstone disease. Methods: A 1 : 1, pair-matched, case-control study was designed. Data from 150 patients with gallstones diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography at a single hospital from June 2009 to June 2010 were collected. A total of 150 patients without gallstones {{during the same period}} at the same hospital were recruited as the control group. Capillary gas chromatography was employed to measure the serum concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) residues. Multiple-factor conditional logistic regression analysis was conducted to estimate the relative risk of gallstones in relation to organochlorine pesticide residues in serum. Results: The percentages of p,p'-DDD and o,p'-DDT in serum of patients were significantly higher than those in serum of controls. The p,p'-DDE, alpha-HCH, and delta-HCH residues in serum of patients were also significantly increased compared with those in serum of controls. Multiple-factor conditional logistic regression analysis showed that high levels of p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT <b>residues</b> were <b>risk</b> factors for gallstone disease. Conclusions: A high level of organochlorine pesticide residues in serum is a potential risk factor for gallstone disease, which suggests that environmental exposure to organochlorine pesticides should be evaluated with respect to gallstone formation.

In a population of dysphagic head and neck cancer patients, we evaluated {{the reliability and validity of}} the AIM-derived swallow risk index (SRI) and a novel measure of post-swallow residue (iZn/Z) by comparing it against videofluoroscopy as the gold standard for assessing aspiration and post-swallow <b>residue</b> <b>risk.</b> Materials and Methods: Three blinded experts classified 88 videofluoroscopic swallows from 16 patients for aspiration and the degree of post-swallow residue using validated videofluroscopy scales. Pressure-impedance recordings of the swallows were also analysed using automated analysis software by one expert and two novice observers who derived the SRI and iZn/Z. Inter-observer concordance for videofluoroscopic and AIM measures was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Patient SRI and iZn/Z measurements were compared with videofluoroscopy scores and control subjects to determine validity for detecting clinically relevant swallowing dysfunction.. Results: Among individual swallows, agreement among observers assessing presence of penetration and aspiration on videofluoroscopy was modest (ICC 0. 57).

In Nigeria, pesticide is widely used, thus its traces {{have been detected}} in water, soil and air. Several studies have already indicated {{that most of the}} environmental ecology (air, water, and soil) in Nigeria has been contaminated by persistent organic pesticides like organochlorine and organophosphate. Other reasons of high pesticide residues present in Nigeria environment is due to inappropriate dosage applied of pesticides that leaves behind excess. However, its residues are found above safety levels in the air, water, and soil across the nation. Based on previous analysis, it is indicated that 125, 000 - 130, 000 metric ton pesticides are being applied annually in Nigeria. Despite banned of some pesticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane- and -Hexachlorocyclohexane, they are still being used by farmers in their agricultural production. Many of the Class 1 (high extremely toxic) pesticides are still being used in developing countries like Nigeria. Hence, there is need to sensitize and educate the general public especially the end-users (farmers) particularly on management practices of pesticides.

In {{recent years the}} decline and disappearance of bee species in the wild {{and the collapse of}} honey bee colonies have concerned ecologists and apiculturalists, who search for causes and solutions to this problem. Whilst biological factors such as viral diseases, mite and parasite infections are undoubtedly involved, it is also evident that pesticides applied to agricultural crops {{have a negative impact on}} bees. Most risk assessments have focused on direct acute exposure of bees to agrochemicals from spray drift. However, the large number of pesticide residues found in pollen and honey demand a thorough evaluation of all residual compounds so as to identify those of highest risk to bees. Using data from recent residue surveys and toxicity of pesticides to honey and bumble bees, a comprehensive evaluation of risks under current exposure conditions is presented here. Standard risk assessments are complemented with new approaches that take into account time-cumulative effects over time, especially with dietary exposures. Whilst overall risks appear to be low, our analysis indicates that residues of pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides pose the highest risk by contact exposure of bees with contaminated pollen. However, the synergism of ergosterol inhibiting fungicides with those two classes of insecticides results in much higher risks in spite of the low prevalence of their combined <b>residues.</b> <b>Risks</b> by ingestion of contaminated pollen and honey are of some concern for systemic insecticides, particularly imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, chlorpyrifos and the mixtures of cyhalothri...|$|R
40|$|Background Litchi stink-bug, Tessaratoma papillosa Drury (Hemiptera: Tessaratomidae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} and destructive pest species on Litchi chinensis Sonn and Dimocarpus longan Lour in Southern China. Inappropriate use of chemical pesticides has resulted in serious environmental problems and food pollution. Generating an improved Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy for litchi stink-bug in orchard farming requires development of an effective biological control agent. Entomopathogenic fungi are regarded as a vital ecological factor in the suppression of pest populations under field conditions. With few effective fungi and pathogenic strains available to control litchi stink-bug, exploration of natural resources for promising entomopathogenic fungi is warranted. Methods & Results In this study, two pathogenic fungi were isolated from cadavers of adult T. papillosa. They were identified as Paecilomyces lilacinus and Beauveria bassiana by morphological identification and rDNA-ITS homogeneous analysis. Infection of T. papillosa with B. bassiana and P. lilacinus occurred initially from the antennae, metameres, and inter-segmental membranes. Biological tests showed that the two entomopathogenic fungi induced high mortality in 2 nd and 5 th instar nymphs of T.  papillosa. B. bassiana was highly virulent on 2 nd instar nymphs of T. papillosa, with values for cadaver rate, LC 50 and LT 50 of 88. 89 %, 1. 92  ×  107  conidia/mL and 4. 34 days respectively. Discussion This study provides two valuable entomopathogenic fungi from T.  papillosa.

However, review of literature revealed that, {{there seems to be}} no studies conducted to establish estimated levels of dairy cattle exposure to OCP by estimating levels in dairy cattle feeds, milk, urine, and water, in South Africa. Therefore, this present study was carried out to analyse the possible presence of OCP residues in cattle/ bovine feed, milk, water and urine samples. The samples analysed included, milk (24 samples), urine (12 samples), water (12 samples) and feed (36 samples) which were collected into 50 mL sterile capped bottle from 12 selected farms in Gauteng province of South Africa. Six different OCP residues namely, endosulfan I, endosulfan II, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and endrin were analysed. The samples preparation method for OCP involved the use of liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE) procedure, while separation and quantification was done using a two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight with mass spectrometer (GCXGC TOF MS). The results of the perception study revealed that out of the 12 farms, 41. 7 % practice chemical method and 58 % practice biological method of pest control.

In undertaking this process we can lower feeding costs for pig production in Vietnam by the use of local feeds which are cheaper, generate new industries in Vietnam harvesting or processing these feeds and increase the incomes of Vietnamese workers who are involved in producing these by-products. Our project has shown that rubber seed, when processed correctly to lower the hydrogen cyanide content, is a safe and suitable protein meal feedstuff for use in pig diets with the potential to replace significant quantities of imported soybean and fishmeal in Vietnamese pig diets as long as diets are balanced for any amino acid shortfalls.

It has been favoured in the USA and Australia for the field control of rodents and other animal pest species because of its comparatively low risk of secondary poisoning and lack of environmental persistence. Zn 3 P 2 paste was approved {{for use as a}} possum control agent in New Zealand by the Environmental Protection Authority in August 2011. A micro-encapsulated form of Zn 3 P 2 has been developed for use in paste and in the future will be developed in solid cereal bait, initially for controlling possums and as a rodenticide. New Zealand research over the last 10 – 15 years has focused on several factors, including determining Zn 3 P 2 effectiveness for controlling possums, animal welfare, understanding and reducing non-target risk, and environmental fate. Zn 3 P 2 is fast acting when delivered at toxic doses in baits to possums, with clinical signs first appearing from 15 min, and death after a lethal dose generally occurring in 3 – 5 h. Its toxicity is largely mediated by phosphine, which is formed as a breakdown product when paste is digested; Zn 3 P 2 interacts with stomach acid. A toxic dose for possums will be delivered in 5 g of paste containing 1. 5 % Zn 3 P 2 w/w. When this paste is applied in bait stations in field settings following prefeeding, possum numbers will be rapidly reduced. There should be no long-term <b>residue</b> <b>risks.</b> However, considerable care must be taken when using Zn 3 P 2 for the control of animal pests because, despite low secondary poisoning risks, it has the potential (like other toxins) to cause primary poisoning of non-target species, and treatment of accidental poisoning is difficult. Exposure to sublethal doses has the potential to cause adverse effects, and strict safety precautions must be enforced to protect contractors and workers in the pest control industry. Despite extensive use of Zn 3 P 2 overseas there has been only limited research and practical experience with Zn 3 P 2 paste in New Zealand, especially when compared with alternative tools such as baits containing sodium monofluoroacetate (1080).

However, water quality monitoring performed under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) at most community water systems (CWSs) is typically limited to four data points per year over a few years. Due to this limited sampling, likely maximum residues may be underestimated in risk assessment. In this work, a statistical methodology is proposed to study two types of uncertainties in observed samples and their propagated effect in risk estimates. The methodology was demonstrated using data from 16 CWSs that have three independent databases of atrazine residue to estimate the uncertainty of risk in infants and children. The results showed that in 85 % of the CWSs, chronic risks predicted with the proposed approach may be two- to four-folds higher than that predicted with the current approach, wheras intermediate risks may be two- to three-folds higher in 50 % of the CWSs. In 12 % of the CWSs, however, the proposed methodology showed a lower intermediate risk. A closed-form solution of propagated uncertainty was developed to demonstrate {{the number of years}} (seasons) of data and sampling frequency needed to reduce the uncertainty of risk estimates. In general, this methodology provided good insight into the importance of addressing uncertainty of observed water quality data and the need to predict likely maximum <b>residues</b> in <b>risk</b> assessment...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Food residue is {{frequently}} ob-served in the gastric remnant after distal gastrectomy, despite adequate preparation. We devised a water-in-take method to reduce food residue in the gastric remnant by drinking {{large quantities of}} water in a short time. The aims {{of this study were}} to identify the risk factors for food residue and to study the effec-tiveness of this new method for endoscopy prepa-ration. Methods: A cohort of 708 patients who under-went distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer was re-viewed prospectively. Sixty patients with large amo-unts of food residue were randomly divided into two groups: a water-intake group (n= 40) and a prolonged fasting group (n= 20). Results: The incidences of a large amount of food residue were 15. 7 %, 5. 8 %, 7. 5 %, and 2. 8 % at 3, 12, 24, and 36 months, re-spectively, after distal gastrectomy. Independent risk factors for food residue were endoscopy at 3 months, diabetes mellitus, a body mass index of ＜ 19. 5, and laparoscopic surgery. The proportion of successful preparations at follow-up endoscopy was higher for the water-intake group (70 %) than for the prolonged fasting group (40 %, p= 0. 025). Conclusions: The wa-ter-intake method can be recommended as a prepara-tion for endoscopy in patients who have had repetitive food <b>residue</b> or <b>risk</b> factors after distal gastrectomy...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{residues}} may {{be present}} in eggs from laying hens' exposure to drugs or contaminants. These <b>residues</b> may pose <b>risks</b> to human health. In this study, laying hens received experimental feed containing flubendazole or tylosin at cross contamination levels of 2. 5, 5, and 10 % of the therapeutic dose. Eggs were collected daily {{and analysis of the}} whole egg, egg white, and egg yolk was performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Highest concentrations of the parent molecule flubendazole, as well as the hydrolyzed and the reduced metabolite, were detected in egg yolk. Residue concentrations of the parent molecule were higher compared with those of the metabolites in all egg matrices. No tylosin residue concentrations were detected above the limit of quantification for all concentration groups and in all egg matrices. Neither molecule exceeded the set maximum residue limits...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the preliminary screening {{report of the}} occurrence of β-lactam antibiotic residues in milk on Croatian market. The intensive animal production sometimes leads to the unavoidable presence of residues of veterinary drugs in food. However, {{it is possible to}} reduce the presence of residues in foods of animal origin by using the principles of good veterinary and good manufacturing practices, continuous control of food and using risk assessment approach. Method used for determination of these antibiotics were validated according to the guidelines laid down by European Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. The estimated dietary exposure based on the data on average consumption of milk and the estimated concentration of amoxicillin, ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, cloxacillin, cephapirin, cefazolin, cefoperazone and ceftiofur does not exceed relevant toxicological reference value (acceptable daily intake). These indicate that milk on Croatian market contain very low levels of β-lactam antibiotic <b>residues</b> and toxsicological <b>risk</b> with regard to consuming of milk could not be considered as a public health problem...|$|R
40|$|The use of agrochemicals may be {{a public}} health problem because the {{pesticides}} residues in food can have drawbacks on human health. This work aimed to evaluate health risk associated to the consumption of lettuce. Pesticide residues were determined by HPLC and toxicological indicators (Estimated Daily Intake and the Theoretical Maximum Daily Intake) were calculated and compared to the acceptable daily intake. The results showed that 83. 3 % of lettuce samples contained at least one pesticide whose content is above the maximum <b>residue</b> limit. The <b>risk</b> assessment showed that 1. 7 % of lettuce consumers were exposed to chronic effects of maneb; 1. 7 % lettuce consumers are likely to develop the chronic effects of carbendazim. For the ethyl chlorpyrifos, chlorothalonil, cypermethrin, dimethoate and lambdacyhalothrin, respectively 20. 9 %, 68. 4 %, 87. 2 % and 97. 1 % of lettuce consumers {{were exposed to the}} chronic effects of these pesticides...|$|R
40|$|Using nanofibers as {{dispensers}} for pheromones and kairomones {{in plant}} protection for disrupting insect chemical communication {{is a novel}} approach aiming at popularizing this technique in organic and integrated plant production. Expected advantages of the nanofibers are highly controlled spatiotemporal release rates of pheromones / kairomones, improved climatic stability, and mechanized application. Dispenser types used so far show deficiencies {{in one or more}} of these requirements. Mechanical application of pheromones is a new approach to reduce the costs of manual labour and therefore the environmentally compatible, highly specific and efficient technique of mating disruption may become an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides in integrated pest management. The nanofibers are highly elastic, which prevents breakoff of smaller pieces, and polymers used are biocompatible. Due to the scale of nanofibers the mass input both for pheromones and for polymeric nanofibers is very low. Major environmental benefits are high control specificity, very low concentrations of <b>residues</b> and reduced <b>risk</b> of development towards insect resistance...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{the mass}} of {{herbaceous}} vegetation {{during the dry season}} in semi-arid areas is important for a number of domains in ecology, agronomy, or economy and remote sensing offers relevant spatial coverage and frequency to that end. Existing remote sensing studies dedicated to dry herbaceous vegetation detection are mainly motivated by the assessment of soil tillage intensity and soil <b>residue</b> management, <b>risk</b> of soil erosion, and risk of wildfire linked to {{the mass of}} dead fuel. Few studies so far have dealt with monitoring of straw and litter degradation during the dry season over large areas while they are important fodder for livestock sustainability. MODIS band combinations (NBAR collection 5) were tested against a set of field measurements carried out over 20 rangeland sites from 2004 to 2011 in the Sahel. The best empirical linear models were obtained for indices using MODIS bands in the shortwave infrared domain (Band 6 centered at 1. 6 μm, Band 7 centered at 2. 1 μm), in particular with the Soil Tillage Index (STI). STI explained 66 % of the variance of dry masses (Mass = 3158 (STI − 1. 05), r 2 = 0. 66, RMSE = 280 kg DM/ha, n = 232) for dry and intermediate season data. A regression is also proposed for year-round data (Mass = 3371 (STI − 1. 06), r 2 = 0. 67, RMSE = 352 kg DM/ha, n = 536). The strong inter-site and inter-annual variabilitieswere well captured and the decay ratewas found consistent with grazing intensity and fire occurrence. The results imply that the STI can be applied to monitor the mass of dry tissues in the Sahel and potentially in many semi-arid areas...|$|R
