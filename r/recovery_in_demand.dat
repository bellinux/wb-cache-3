40|$|A slow recovery, commencing in the December {{quarter of}} 1997, is {{expected}} from the current recession. Overall, gross domestic product (GDP) may increase by 2. 8 per cent in the year to the June quarter of 1992, and continue to increase at a similar rate thereafter. This subdued recovery is likely to see the unemployment rate at over 70 per cent {{to the end of}} 1992, before moving down slowly to around 8. 5 per cent by the mid- 1990 s. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation may fall sharply from a peak of 8. 0 per cent in 1989 - 90 to a trough of under 3 per cent in 1997 - 92, due to the recession and movements in oil prices. With a slow recovery, inflation may then increase to 5 per cent per annum in the medium term. The current account deficit has fallen from 6. 0 per cent of GDP in 1989 - 90 to 4. 7 per cent in 1990 - 91, despite a fall in the terms of trade of 5 per cent. However, this has been due to the cyclical downturn. With a slow <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> <b>demand,</b> and rising real labour costs hampering expansion in export and import-competing industries, the current account deficit may once again reach 6 per cent of GDP by the mid- 1990 s, implying steady increases in the foreign debt-to-GDP ratio. This forecast assumes monetary policy targets an inflation rate of 5 per cent per annum. Any further easings in monetary policy may undermine the credibility of the inflation objective with the result that the trade weighted index (TWI) exchange rate may drop sharply from 59.

But the financial crisis has revealed that what makes sense for each player individually does not always make sense in aggregate. These actions had collective consequences. The main lesson from the crisis is the need to find better ways of ensuring the right collective outcome. Improved financial regulation will help to intermediate the flows associated with global imbalances. But the global economy will remain vulnerable to the risks associated with imbalances if they are not tackled at source. Two principles should underpin the way ahead. First, discussions should focus on the underlying disagreement about the right speed of adjustment to the real pattern of spending and hence the reduction in these imbalances. This discussion should be informed by countries’ ability to follow that path in a sustainable way. Second, many policies, in addition to changes in exchange rates, will be needed to reduce imbalances. If agreement is not reached on these two principles, at best there will be a weak world recovery; at worst, the seeds of the next financial crisis will be sown. ...|$|R

Scenarios were analyzed with USFPM/GFPM ranging from a baseline 48 % increase to a 173 % increase in annual U.

Results indicate that expansion in wood energy consumption across the range of scenarios may have little impact on U.

Local Anesthetic Delivery Options and Mechanism of Action Local anesthetics (LAs) traditionally are administered for analgesia via subcutaneous infiltration and regional nerve block procedures. The use of continuous neuraxial and perineural blockade with LAs is a common approach to manage pain after major operations, but this may not be an option for many hospitalized or outpatient surgery patients.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how firms adjust output and prices {{in response to}} changes <b>in</b> <b>demand</b> and costs, paying {{particular attention to the}} role that capacity utilisation plays in affecting these relationships. It primarily uses qualitative survey data on manufacturing firms’ actual and expected outcomes for these variables, and traces through the short-term effects of changes <b>in</b> <b>demand</b> on costs, output and prices. The survey data also enables an analysis of how firms respond to unexpected shocks to costs and demand. The paper finds that strong demand growth leads to increases in both output and prices, and {{there is some evidence that}} capacity constraints do affect this relationship. When capacity utilisation is high, changes <b>in</b> <b>demand</b> have a smaller effect on output and a larger effect on prices, than when capacity utilisation is low. The paper distinguishes between the direct effect that changes <b>in</b> <b>demand</b> have on prices, through changes in margins, and the indirect effect, through demand-induced changes in firms’ costs. It finds that inflationary pressures are predominantly driven by increases in input costs. While margins appear to move pro-cyclically, there is a degree of asymmetry in their behaviour. Movements in margins appear to be largest in recessionary periods with margins falling as the economy goes into recession and then being rebuilt relatively early <b>in</b> the <b>recovery.</b> <b>In</b> boom times pressures on prices come largely through increases in costs, with little additional contribution from changes in margins. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{world economy}} has {{overcome}} the cyclical trough. On {{the back of}} extensive economic stimulus programs, most economies returned to positive growth rates {{in the second half}} of 2009, with emerging countries taking the lead. The rate of the recovery, however, diverges strongly across the different regions. Not only the emerging Asian countries grew at a vigorous pace; the U. S. economy, too, posted healthy quarter-on-quarter growth at a rate last seen six years ago. Yet, recentconfidence indicators suggest that economic growth will continue at a slower pace. While the world economic <b>recovery</b> gained momentum <b>in</b> the fourth quarter of 2009, the development of economic activity in the euro area remained below expectations. In comparison with the previous quarter, the economy of the single currency area grew by 0. 1 % in the fourth quarter of 2009, with growth driven exclusively by the positive contribution of net exports. Euro area domestic demand is unlikely to give growth a genuine boost in the quarters to come. Current forecasts generally point to a gradual recovery of economic activity in the euro area, which will, however, be weaker than the U. S. revival. Euro area HICP inflation returned to positive levels in November 2009. This was due primarily to base effects stemming from commodity prices. The disinflation process of core items, however, is continuing. Given the sluggish <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> economic activity, the annual core inflation rate fell to a record low of 0. 8 % in February 2010. The latest forecasts predict that there will be no risks to price stability until the end of 2011. Especially thanks to a slight <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> international <b>demand,</b> the Central, Eastern and Southeastern (CESEE) EU Member States entered a period of economic stabilization {{in the second half of}} 2009, recording – once again – moderately positive average growth rates (on a quarterly basis).

The economic downturn caused current account balances to improve throughout the entire region and brought down inflation rates in several countries.
