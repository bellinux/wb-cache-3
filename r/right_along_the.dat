Here, NY48 turns north, and begins to run as an alternate to NY481. Both routes run from the Syracuse area to downtown Oswego. NY48 runs <b>right</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> western side of the Oswego River, while NY481 runs along {{the eastern side of the}} river. Both routes run through downtown Fulton and Oswego which are the two cities along the Oswego River. At several points, all that separates the two routes is the river itself.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant Colonel F. O. Chilton's 2/2nd Infantry Battalion {{found that}} it was best to keep skirmishing forward {{throughout}} this advance, because going to ground {{for any length of time}} meant sitting in the middle of the enemy artillery concentrations that inflicted further casualties. The Australian troops made good progress, six tank crossings were readied and mines between them and the wire had been detected. Five minutes later, the 23 Matildas of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment advanced, accompanied by the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion. Passing through the gaps, they swung <b>right</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> double line of posts.|$|E
5|$|Early on 6 April 1941, the German XLVI Motorised Corps {{launched}} preliminary attacks {{along the}} Drava between Ždala and Gotalovo {{in the area}} of the 27th Infantry Division Savska with the intention of securing crossings over the river, but they were unsuccessful. By the evening, German successes along the Hungarian border made it clear to the Germans that the Yugoslavs would not be resisting stubbornly at the frontier. The XLVI Motorised Corps was then ordered to begin seizing bridges over the Drava <b>right</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> 4th Army front, including at Zákány near Gyékényes. These local attacks were sufficient to inflame dissent within the largely Croat 4th Army, who refused to resist the Germans which they considered their liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{fashioned}} {{the first}} chance {{of the second half}} after just three minutes, when Rooney cut inside from the <b>right</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> face of the penalty area, but his left-footed shot was blocked away for a corner kick. Soon after, Van Nistelrooy received the ball {{on the edge of the}} penalty area and held it up before playing a through-ball to Keane, but the Irishman's low cross was diverted behind by Kolo Touré before it reached Rooney. United then had their third chance in the space of five minutes when Ronaldo shot just wide from 25 yards, from the left corner of the penalty area.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry {{held the}} regiment's left flank west of Komam-ni, while the 2nd Battalion held the <b>right</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Nam River. 3rd Battalion, redesignated from the 1st Battalion, 29th Infantry, was in reserve {{on the road}} south of Chirwon from where it could move quickly to {{any part of the}} line. To the south was the US 24th Infantry Regiment and west of Chindong-ni, the 5th Regimental Combat Team was on the {{division}}'s left flank. On division orders, the 5th Regimental Combat Team first held the ground above the Chindong-ni coastal road only as far as Yaban-san. Kean soon decided, however, that the 5th RCT should close the gap northward between it and the 24th Infantry. When the 5th sent a South Korean unit of 100 men under American officers to the higher slope of Sobuk-san, North Korean troops already there drove them back. Kean then ordered the 5th RCT to take this ground, but it was too late.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon himself {{oversaw the}} initial {{deployment}} of the Middle and Old Guard. The Middle Guard formed in battalion squares, each about 550 men strong, with the 1st/3rd Grenadiers, led by Generals Friant and Poret de Morvan, on the <b>right</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> road, to their left and rear was General Harlet leading {{the square of the}} 4th Grenadiers, then the 1st/3rd Chasseurs under General Michel, next the 2nd/3rd Chasseurs and finally the large single square of two battalions of 800 soldiers of the 4th Chasseurs led by General Henrion. Two batteries of Imperial Guard Horse Artillery accompanied them with sections of two guns between the squares. Each square was led by a general and Marshal Ney, mounted on his 5th horse of the day, led the advance. Behind them, in reserve, were the three battalions of the Old Guard, right to left 1st/2nd Grenadiers, 2nd/2nd Chasseurs and 1st/2nd Chasseurs. Napoleon left Ney to conduct the assault, however Ney led the Middle Guard on an oblique towards the Allied centre right instead of attacking straight up the centre. Napoleon sent Ney's senior ADC Colonel Crabbé to order Ney to adjust, but Crabbé was unable to get there in time.|$|E

25|$|For the {{execution}} of his project the Napoleon initiated an attack by the Imperial Guard, with Milhaud's Corps of Cuirassiers in support. He wished to conceal this movement {{as much as possible}} from the Prussians, and caused it to be made to the <b>right,</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> rear of the IV Corps (Gérard's), a portion of whose batteries were ordered to be withdrawn, for the purpose of affording greater protection to the Guard, by diverting the Prussians's fire to other points, and of deceiving them as to the real object of the movement, if observed previously to the actual execution of Napoleon's design.|$|E
25|$|The two forces {{made contact}} south of New Market about mid-morning, {{with the main}} Union line west of the town near the North Fork of the Shenandoah River; Colonel Augustus Moor {{initially}} commanded the Union forces present on the battlefield at this time, which consisted of his infantry brigade and part of John E. Wynkoop's cavalry brigade. Additional Union regiments arrived throughout the morning and deployed between the North Fork of the Shenandoah River and the Valley Turnpike, with the main line centered on Manor's Hill. Breckinridge deployed Wharton's brigade on the Confederate left west of the Valley Turnpike and Echols's brigade on the <b>right</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Pike; Echols was ill that morning, so his brigade was commanded by Colonel George S. Patton, Sr. The VMI cadets battalion was kept in reserve, while Imboden's cavalry was east of the turnpike. Breckinridge attempted to lure the Federals into attacking him using cavalry and artillery, but Moor refused to move from his position. About 11 a.m., Breckinridge then decided to launch an attack on Moor using his infantry, while Imboden's brigade crossed Smith's Creek east of New Market, rode north, and recrossed the stream behind the Union lines. Union cavalry General Stahel arrived at New Market at this time with additional troops, followed shortly afterwards by Union General Sigel.|$|E

500|$|This {{building}} {{contained the}} offices of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company for well over a century. The company was originally established by George Westinghouse in 1869. Westinghouse had developed many companies during this time of industrial growth {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. The Air Brake plant, that made for improved performance and increased speed on the nations railways, was moved to its new location in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania in 1889. Wilmerding is a small town about [...] outside of Pittsburgh which, at the time, was only inhabited by about 5,000 people. Socialism was strong in Wilmerding and it was a peaceful non-violent farming borough. It was thought to be “The Ideal Town” for the company because of its location <b>right</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvania Railroad and its mainly blue collar inhabitants. The Air Brake Company employed 3,000 citizens from the surrounding Pittsburgh area, but its work force was composed almost entirely of individuals from Wilmerding.|$|E
500|$|Britain was not {{unaware of}} French {{preparations}} at Toulon {{and along the}} Mediterranean coast, but despite sustained efforts by British agents in France the destination of the French fleet was unknown. Egypt was not seriously considered by the British government: when Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas suggested it, he was urged by Foreign Secretary Lord Grenville to think [...] "with a map in your hand, and with a calculation of distances." [...] Letters reached London and St. Vincent at the Tagus describing extensive preparations <b>right</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> French and Italian Mediterranean coastlines, but the distances between the base in the Tagus and Toulon prevented any sustained observation of French movements. Urgent orders were sent from Lord Spencer at the Admiralty to Vice-Admiral Earl St. Vincent, commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet at the Tagus, to despatch a squadron to investigate {{under the command of}} Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson. Nelson had returned to the fleet three days earlier at Lord Spencer's order, following recovery in Britain from the loss of an arm at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in July 1797.|$|E
500|$|Less than [...] up the trail, D Company {{came under}} machine gun fire from its right flank, which inflicted several casualties. Kennedy {{rejected}} Vandygriff's request {{to take a}} squad and knock out the gun, so the file got past {{the line of fire}} as best it could until M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle fire from the 3rd Platoon silenced the weapon. Farther up the trail another North Korean machine gun fired from the <b>right</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> trail and held up the advance until US artillery fire silenced it. The file of men left the trail-like road, which dead-ended, dropped over into a ravine on the left, and continued the climb. North Korean mortar fire killed two men and wounded eight or ten others in this phase of the ascent. At this time the 2nd Platoon leader collapsed from a kidney ailment and command passed to Vandygriff. Vandygriff led his platoon, now {{at the head of the}} company, on up the gully and at about 17:00, came through a tunnel under a small ridge and the stone wall into the bowl-shaped summit of Hill 755, the southern arm of the Hill 902 crest.
