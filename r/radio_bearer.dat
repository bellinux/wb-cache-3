50|$|The set of {{properties}} related to data transmission is called <b>Radio</b> <b>Bearer</b> (RB). This set {{of properties}} decides the maximum allowed {{data in a}} TTI (Transmission Time Interval). RB includes RLC information and RB mapping. RB mapping decides the mapping between RB<->logical channel<->transport channel. Signaling messages are sent on Signaling Radio Bearers (SRBs) and data packets (either CS or PS) are sent on data RBs. RRC and NAS messages go on SRBs.|$|E
50|$|The UE (User Equipment) {{interface}} of the RAN (Radio Access Network) primarily {{consists of}} RRC (Radio Resource Control), PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol), RLC (Radio Link Control) and MAC (Media Access Control) protocols. RRC protocol handles connection establishment, measurements, <b>radio</b> <b>bearer</b> services, security and handover decisions. RLC protocol primarily divides into three Modesâ€”Transparent Mode (TM), Unacknowledge Mode (UM), Acknowledge Mode (AM). The functionality of AM entity resembles TCP operation whereas UM operation resembles UDP operation. In TM mode, {{data will be}} sent to lower layers without adding any header to SDU of higher layers. MAC handles the scheduling of data on air interface depending on higher layer (RRC) configured parameters.|$|E

5000|$|Standalone GPS {{provides}} first {{position in}} approximately 30-40 seconds. A standalone GPS needs orbital information of the satellites {{to calculate the}} current position. The data rate of the satellite signal is only 50 bit/s, so downloading orbital information like ephemerides and the almanac directly from satellites typically takes a long time, and if the satellite signals are lost during the acquisition of this information, it is discarded and the standalone system has to start from scratch. In A-GPS, the network operator deploys an A-GPS server, a [...] cache server for GPS data. These A-GPS servers download the orbital information from the satellite and store it in the database. An A-GPS-capable device can connect to these servers and download this information using mobile-network <b>radio</b> <b>bearers</b> such as GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, LTE or even using other <b>radio</b> <b>bearers</b> such as Wi-Fi. Usually the data rate of these bearers is high, hence downloading orbital information takes less time.|$|R
50|$|A {{bearer service}} is a link between two points, which is defined by a certain set of characteristics. Whenever a UE is being {{provided}} with any service (CS/PS service), the service has {{to be associated with}} a <b>Radio</b> <b>Bearer</b> specifying the configuration for Layer-2 and Physical Layer in order to have its QOS clearly defined. Radio bearers are channels offered by Layer 2 to higher layers for the transfer of either user or control data. In other words, Layer 2 offers to the upper layers the service of information transmission between the UE and the UTRAN by means of the Radio Bearers (RBs) and Signaling Radio Bearers (SRBs). Therefore the service access points between Layer 2 and upper layers are RBs.|$|E

Multicast {{transmission}} {{is one of}} the major goals for Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) that motivated the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) to launch the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) framework. MBMS constitutes a significant step towards the so-called Mobile Broadband, since it allows the efficient utilization of network and radio resources. One of most important problems that MBMS is currently facing is the assignment of the appropriate transport channel for the transmission of MBMS data. This paper proposes an alternative solution to this problem, by introducing a cost-based scheme for the efficient <b>radio</b> <b>bearer</b> selection that minimizes the overall delivery cost.
