30|$|Also note that, {{while the}} above three {{communication}} systems yield the same spectral efficiency, the <b>relay</b> in a one-way <b>relaying</b> system needs to transmit more symbols (and thus consume more energy) {{as compared to}} the <b>relay</b> in a two-way <b>relaying</b> system. Indeed, in a one-way <b>relaying</b> system, the <b>relay</b> is active during two slots, transmitting a total of 2, 034 symbols. In a two-way <b>relaying</b> system, the <b>relay</b> is only active during one slot, transmitting a total of 1, 536 symbols.

30|$|In {{cooperative}} <b>relay</b> networks, a <b>relay</b> {{is basically}} employed as {{two types of}} <b>relaying</b> methods: amplify‐and‐forward (AF) and decode‐and‐forward (DF) <b>relaying.</b> In the former scheme, a <b>relay</b> simply amplifies the received signal from the source and forwards it to the corresponding destination irrespective of source‐to‐relay (SR) link condition [4]. In the latter scheme, a <b>relay</b> first decodes the received signal and re‐encodes it for forwarding regardless of the decoding result at the <b>relay,</b> namely, fixed DF <b>relaying</b> scheme [5] or determines whether to forward it or not depending on the channel condition of the SR link, namely, selective DF <b>relaying</b> scheme [6].

40|$|Abstract — A four {{terminal}} Gaussian network, {{composed of}} a single source-destination pair, a <b>relay</b> and a wire-tapper is considered. Unlike the <b>relay</b> channel with a wire-tapper, {{it is assumed that}} the <b>relay</b> assists the wire-tapper, not the destination. The <b>relay’s</b> objective is to decrease the achievable secrecy rates.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} <b>relaying</b> in interference-limited networks by studying a two-user Gaussian interference channel with a <b>relay</b> (ICR). Various models for <b>relay</b> reception and transmission are possible: The <b>relay</b> can receive and transmit in the same band as the sources (i. e., in-band <b>relay</b> reception / transmission), or else <b>relay</b> reception, or both reception and transmission, can take place over orthogonal links of limited capacity (i. e., out-of-band <b>relay</b> reception or / and transmission). In all scenarios, the selection of either signal <b>relaying,</b> interference forwarding or a combination thereof for the <b>relay</b> operation is identified as a common design choice. While signal <b>relaying</b> enables the destination to obtain a stronger desired signal or additional information, interference forwarding helps removing part of the interference. Important scenarios under which signal <b>relaying</b> and interference forwarding are optimal are identified, including cognitive <b>relaying</b> where the <b>relay</b> is unaware of the source codebooks and out-of band <b>relaying,</b> both under certain modified strong interference conditions and the latter under additional capacity constraints on the orthogonal <b>relay</b> links.
