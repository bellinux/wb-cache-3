5|$|Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods {{as that of}} diamond: Cubic {{boron nitride}} is {{produced}} by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as synthetic diamond is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230°C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion. The addition of {{a small amount of}} boron oxide can lower the <b>required</b> <b>pressure</b> to 4–7GPa and temperature to 1500°C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or hydrazine. Other industrial synthesis methods, again borrowed from diamond growth, use crystal growth in a temperature gradient, or explosive shock wave. The shock wave method is used to produce material called heterodiamond, a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|The {{regulator}} {{ensures that}} {{pressure of the}} gas from the tanks matches the <b>required</b> <b>pressure</b> in the hose. The flow rate is then adjusted by the operator using needle valves on the torch. Accurate flow control with a needle valve relies on a constant inlet pressure.|$|E

Larger particles are used in preparative HPLC (column diameters 5cm up to >30cm) and for non-HPLC applications such as solid-phase extraction.|$|E

25|$|Any type of pump {{that can}} deliver the <b>required</b> <b>pressure</b> {{difference}} and flow volume can be used. Most often used is the dynamic-compression centrifugal type compressor, which {{is familiar to}} most as being used in vacuum cleaners and turbochargers, but multistaged axial-flow compressor types, {{similar to those used}} in most jet engines, could work as well, although there would be little need for the added cost and complexities involved, as they typically don't require such a high flow rate as a jet engine, nor are they limited by the aerodynamic drag considerations which makes a narrow-diameter axial compressor more effective in jet engines than a centrifugal compressor of equal air flow. Positive displacement types such as piston compressors, or rotary types such as a Roots blower could also be used with suitable provisions for damping the pulsations in the air flow (however, other rotary types such as twin screw compressors are capable of providing a steady supply of compressed fluid). The pressure ratio of a single fan blade is too low and cannot be used.|$|E
2500|$|... {{fill the}} {{cylinder}} to the <b>required</b> <b>pressure,</b> let the cylinder cool {{and measure the}} gas pressure and then repeat the process until the correct pressure is achieved. The cooling interval needed depends on the ambient temperature. This step must be followed for each component of the mixture.|$|E
2500|$|... {{fill the}} {{cylinders}} with 5 to 20% more gas (as pressure readings) than required. If the overfill (in pressure while hot) is well judged, when the cylinder cools the final pressure will {{be within the}} tolerance of the <b>required</b> <b>pressure.</b> This is relatively quick, but requires good judgement based on experience, or measurement of {{the temperature of the}} gases in the cylinder after each stage of the mixing, and corrections must be made to allow for the influence of the temperature.|$|E

50|$|Catalytic {{hydrogenation}} {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} amides to amines; however, the process often <b>requires</b> high hydrogenation <b>pressures</b> and reaction temperatures to be effective (i.e. often <b>requiring</b> <b>pressures</b> above 197 atm and temperatures exceeding 200 °C).

50|$|Pomeranchuk cooling is the {{phenomenon}} in which liquid helium-3 will cool {{if it is}} compressed isentropically when it is below 0.3 K. This occurs because helium-3 has the unique property that solidification below 0.3 K <b>requires</b> <b>pressure.</b> This {{can be used to}} construct a cryogenic cooler.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{essential}} that the refrigerant reach a sufficiently high temperature, when compressed, to release heat through the [...] "hot" [...] heat exchanger (the condenser). Similarly, the fluid must reach a sufficiently low temperature when allowed to expand, or else heat cannot flow from the ambient cold region into the fluid in the cold heat exchanger (the evaporator). In particular, the pressure difference must be great enough for the fluid to condense at the hot side and still evaporate in the lower pressure region at the cold side. The greater the temperature difference, the greater the <b>required</b> <b>pressure</b> difference, and consequently the more energy needed to compress the fluid. Thus, as with all heat pumps, the coefficient of performance (amount of thermal energy moved per unit of input work required) decreases with increasing temperature difference.|$|E
6000|$|Prof. Andrews {{has shown}} that for each kind of gaseous matter there is a {{temperature}} above which no amount of pressure can cause liquefaction. The remark, made a priori in the above extract, [...] "that if, under increasing pressure, a gas retains all the heat evolved, its resisting force is absolutely unlimited", harmonizes with the inductively-reached result that if the temperature is not lowered to its [...] "critical point" [...] a gas does not liquify, however great the force applied. At the same time Prof. Andrews' experiments imply that, supposing the temperature to be lowered to {{the point at which}} liquefaction becomes possible, then liquefaction will take place where there is first reached the <b>required</b> <b>pressure.</b> What are the corollaries in relation to concentrating nebulous spheroids? ...|$|E
