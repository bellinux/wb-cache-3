5|$|The {{election}} {{was conducted by}} voice vote, a qualified elector would tell the returning officer at a polling station who {{he was going to}} vote for and the <b>results</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> tallied. Under the terms of the Act eligible electors were males who had reached the age of majority, which was 21 years of age at that time. The act specified that electors must be bona fide males who were not aliens or unenfranchised Indians. Electors must also have resided in the territory for at least 12 months to the day of the writ being dropped.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, the Lithuanian {{government}} {{discussed the}} new developments. It decided that Merkys {{should return to}} Kaunas and Urbšys should deliver a note offering withdrawal from the Baltic Entente, a full investigation of the incident, and dismissal of Skučas and Povilaitis. A personal letter from President Antanas Smetona to Chairman of Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Mikhail Kalinin repeated assurances that Lithuania always honored the mutual assistance pact. The third and final meeting between Merkys, Urbšys, and Molotov on June 11 brought no resolution. The Soviets continued to press charges which the Lithuanians could not meaningfully answer and made no more actionable requests. On June 12, Merkys returned to Lithuania and informed {{the government of the}} situation. It was decided that Skučas should resign and Povilaitis would be immediately dismissed. The Lithuanian Army was ordered to be alert, but no orders were issued regarding mobilization or preparedness. Lithuanian politicians did not fully understand the gravity of the situation and did not think the <b>results</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> catastrophic. Urbšys reported that the Soviets strongly disapproved of Merkys and his cabinet; he suggested that a new government be installed, possibly led by Stasys Raštikis, former Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Army. Such suggestion interfered with Lithuania's domestic affairs.|$|E
25|$|The Cleveland Police Department {{received}} {{statements from}} both Loehmann and Garmback.

25|$|Once {{the first}} round of auditions was completed, the series moved to the Criterion Theatre, where further auditions saw the judges decide on a group of 50.

25|$|Proponents {{argue that}} Interlingua's source {{languages}} {{include not only}} Romance languages but English, German, and Russian as well. Moreover, the source languages are widely spoken internationally, and large numbers of their words also appear in other languages – still more when derivative forms and loan translations are included. Tests had shown that if {{a larger number of}} source languages were used, the <b>results</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> about the same. So, IALA selected a much simpler extraction procedure for Interlingua with little adverse effect on its internationality.|$|E

25|$|A {{construction}} {{site for a}} section of the new line was announced publicly on 30 March 1999. The Planungsgesellschaft Bahnbau Deutsche Einheit justified this {{in the absence of a}} financial agreement with the federal government. About DM 650million had previously been invested by the company in the project. The Federal Ministry of Transport and Communications emphasised that the project would be re-examined and that the <b>results</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> available within weeks. At the end of May 1999, it became apparent that the project would not be realised in the planned form, especially due to the substitution of cheaper materials.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{importance}} of Iraq, the potential for catastrophe, and the role and commitments of the United States in initiating events that have led to the current situation, we believe it would be wrong for the United States to abandon the country through a precipitate withdrawal of troops and support. A premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term <b>results</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return.|$|E
25|$|On 11 October 2009 the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) {{announced}} that {{the format of the}} semi-finals was to be changed so that the <b>results</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> determined by a combination of 50% national jury and 50% televoting, making it more consistent with the final. Each country's votes were determined by combining the jury votes and the televoting results; the countries with the top ten highest points in each semi-final then qualify to participate in the final of the contest. This replaces the semi-final format used in the 2008 and 2009 contests in which the countries with the top nine highest points from the televoting results in each semi-final qualified for the final. The tenth semi-final place was then given to the country with the highest number of points from the jury's votes which had not already qualified for the final from the televoting results. On 26 October 2009 the EBU {{announced that}} the voting would be open throughout the competition and would conclude 15 minutes {{after the end of the}} very last song.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} four games, the outcome was all but decided {{by the end of}} the first quarter. In the gold medal game against Canada, the <b>results</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very different. Canada entered the game with a 4–0 record, the same as the USA team. The game started with low scoring, neither team {{managing}} to reach double digits in the quarter. At the end of the first quarter the teams were tied 9–9. The scoring picked up in the second quarter, but by both teams. The USA team, after hitting only 3 of their first 16 field goal attempts, went on a 10–0 run to take an eight-point lead, but Canada did not fold, and responded to tie the game. The teams were tied at 27 points each at halftime. The teams traded baskets early in the third period, but then the USA went on a 22–0 run to take a large lead. The USA extended the lead until it reached 38 points in the fourth quarter. Canada out scored the USA over the final minutes, but the game was out of reach, and the USA went on to win the game 82–48, and the gold medal. Asia Durr was named the tournament MVP. She had set three single game records for the U16 tournament, including most points, 26, most steals, 8, and most field goal attempts 22. Teammate Katie Lou Samuelson also set a record. She hit 8 three pointers on only eight attempts in the final game, to set a record for three pointers made and three point shooting percentage for a game.|$|E

In March 2009, Dr. Michael Coble of the US Armed Forces DNA Identification Lab published the final, peer reviewed results of the recent tests on the 2007 remains, comparing them with the 1991 remains, concluding the entire family died together in 1918. Russian and Austrian scientists got the same results. This finding confirms that all of the Tsar's family were accounted for.|$|E
500|$|In March 1950, Fairchild died. Fairchild {{had been}} Saville's {{champion}} in the USAF, and Saville had used Fairchild's influence as a shield to [...] "get things done", according to Smart. In the process, Saville had made enough enemies in the Air Staff that he realized Fairchild's absence would greatly limit his career advancement. He began planning his retirement, finishing ongoing projects, and first selecting then grooming his replacement: Brigadier General Laurence C. Craigie. In June 1950, Saville gave a lecture on air defense at the Air War College, Maxwell AFB, Alabama, telling the students that the optimal air defense system as he envisaged {{might be able to}} destroy 60% of an attacking bomber force, but that realistic <b>results</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> closer to 30% reduction. He emphasized the need for better intelligence regarding Soviet offensive airpower capabilities, to increase the accuracy of air defense predictions.|$|E
500|$|Both {{before and}} after {{becoming}} IOC president, Brundage {{was involved in a}} number of controversies involving threats to, or sometimes actual disqualification of, athletes for breach of amateur rules. In 1932, he was part of a special committee of the IAAF which disqualified Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi from the Los Angeles Games for allegedly accepting monetary compensation. At the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, rival US ice hockey teams, sponsored by different accrediting organizations (one from the AAU and the other from AHAUS), came to the Games. The dispute proved difficult, and the IOC initially voted to cancel the tournament and eliminate ice hockey as an Olympic sport, but relented as thousands of tickets had been sold by the organizers. A compromise was then reached: the AAU team, which had the backing of Brundage and the AOC, would march in the Opening Ceremony, while the AHAUS team, not favored by Brundage but supported by the LIHG (the forerunner to today's IIHF) and featuring current and former professional players, were allowed to compete but could not earn an Olympic medal. However, since at the time the Olympic hockey tournament also doubled as that year's Ice Hockey World Championships, their <b>results</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> recorded for that competition, in which they finished fourth. In 1972, Brundage banned Austrian skier Karl Schranz from the Sapporo Winter Olympics for commercial activities, calling him [...] "a walking billboard".|$|E

Based on these hints, the Financial Times dedicated an entire two-column article to the issue. Between then and early 1958, the British press published an average of two articles a week on ZETA. Even the US papers picked up the story; on 17 November The New York Times reported on the hints of success.|$|E
