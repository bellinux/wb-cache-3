25|$|Prior to the Second World War, {{the subject}} was {{commonly}} known as <b>radio</b> <b>engineering</b> and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and radar, commercial radio, and early television. Later, in post war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems, computers, and microprocessors. In the mid-to-late 1950s, the term <b>radio</b> <b>engineering</b> gradually {{gave way to the}} name electronic engineering.|$|E

25|$|Currently a {{large-scale}} project for UAVs {{is being developed}} for tender to the Russian government. Originally, twelve Russian companies submitting 22 different types of unmanned aircraft {{were involved in the}} competition. In November 2010, however, the selection was narrowed down to three submissions, one of which is the ZALA 421-04M, designed by ZALA Aero in association with the Vega <b>Radio</b> <b>Engineering</b> Corporation. The three UAVs selected as finalists are currently undergoing trials before the final selection of a winner in the competition.|$|E
25|$|Dipoles whose {{length is}} {{approximately}} half the wavelength {{of the signal}} are called half-wave dipoles and are widely used as such or {{as the basis for}} derivative antenna designs. These have a radiation resistance which is much greater, closer to the characteristic impedances of available transmission lines, and normally much larger than the resistance of the conductors, so that their efficiency approaches 100%. In general <b>radio</b> <b>engineering,</b> the term dipole, if not further qualified, is taken to mean a center-fed half-wave dipole.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the term}} {{aliasing}} evolved from <b>radio</b> <b>engineering</b> {{because of the}} action of superheterodyne receivers. When the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies, from RF to IF by heterodyning, an unwanted signal, from an RF frequency equally far from the local oscillator (LO) frequency as the desired signal, but {{on the wrong side}} of the LO, can end up at the same IF frequency as the wanted one. If it is strong enough it can interfere with reception of the desired signal. This unwanted signal is known as an image or alias of the desired signal.|$|E

25|$|The major {{interests}} of the AIEE were wire communications (telegraphy and telephony) and light and power systems. The IRE concerned mostly <b>radio</b> <b>engineering,</b> and was formed from two smaller organizations, the Society of Wireless and Telegraph Engineers and the Wireless Institute. With the rise of electronics in the 1930s, electronics engineers usually became members of the IRE, but the applications of electron tube technology became so extensive that the technical boundaries differentiating the IRE and the AIEE became difficult to distinguish. After World War II, the two organizations became increasingly competitive, and in 1961, the leadership of both the IRE and the AIEE resolved to consolidate the two organizations. The two organizations formally merged as the IEEE on January 1, 1963.|$|E
25|$|Chaos theory {{began in}} the field of ergodic theory. Later studies, also on the topic of {{nonlinear}} differential equations, were carried out by George David Birkhoff, Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, Mary Lucy Cartwright and John Edensor Littlewood,)y + y = bλkcos(λt + a), k large |journal=Journal of the London Mathematical Society |volume=20 |pages=180–9 |year=1945 |doi=10.1112/jlms/s1-20.3.180 |issue=3 }} See also: Van der Pol oscillator and Stephen Smale. Except for Smale, these studies were all directly inspired by physics: the three-body problem in the case of Birkhoff, turbulence and astronomical problems in the case of Kolmogorov, and <b>radio</b> <b>engineering</b> in the case of Cartwright and Littlewood. Although chaotic planetary motion had not been observed, experimentalists had encountered turbulence in fluid motion and nonperiodic oscillation in radio circuits without the benefit of a theory to explain what they were seeing.|$|E
25|$|To {{reduce the}} PAK FA's {{developmental}} risk {{and spread out}} associated costs, {{as well as to}} bridge the gap between it and older previous generation fighters, some of its technology and features, such as propulsion and avionics, were implemented in the Sukhoi Su-35S fighter, an advanced variant of the Su-27. The Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association (NAPO) is manufacturing the new multi-role fighter at Komsomol'sk-on-Amur along with Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAPO), and final assembly is to take place at Komsomol'sk-on-Amur. Following a competition held in 2003, the Tekhnokompleks Scientific and Production Center, Ramenskoye Instrument Building Design Bureau, the Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design (NIIP), the Ural Optical and Mechanical Plant (UOMZ) in Yekaterinburg, the Polet firm in Nizhny Novgorod and the Central Scientific Research <b>Radio</b> <b>Engineering</b> Institute in Moscow were selected for the development of the PAK-FA's avionics suite. NPO Saturn is the lead contractor for the interim engines; Saturn and MMPP Salyut will compete for the definitive second stage engines.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, the {{aircraft}} industry consisted of 106 enterprises, 18 of which {{belonged to the}} United Aircraft Corporation. One {{of the most successful}} companies is Sukhoi, which possesses a wide portfolio of internationally competitive military aircraft, including the Su-27, Su-30 and Su-35 models. On the civilian segment, the company's most important project is the Superjet 100. Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association, Russia's largest aircraft enterprise, is responsible for manufacturing Sukhoi products. Joint Stock Company Tupolev focuses on the civil aviation market with its Tu-204 and Tu-214 planes, but is also responsible for the long-range bomber Tu-160 and for developing its successors. Mass production of Tu-204 planes is accomplished by Aviastar SP, located in Ulyanovsk, while the Tu-214 variant is produced by Kazan Aircraft Production Association. Ilyushin focuses on the military cargo and transport sector. Irkut has a portfolio of trainer and amphibious aircraft projects and competes in the onboard electronics and avionics niche. In the unmanned aerial vehicle segment, ZALA Aero and Vega <b>Radio</b> <b>Engineering</b> Corporation are among the leading companies.|$|E

500|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the team created a {{computer}} program which could evaluate the RCS of possible designs. The RCS-prediction software was called [...] "ECHO 1". As tests with the program proceeded, {{it became apparent that}} edge calculations by the program were incorrect due to diffraction. In 1964, Pyotr Ufimtsev, the chief scientist of the Moscow Institute for <b>Radio</b> <b>Engineering,</b> published a seminal paper titled Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction. The work was translated by the Air Force Systems Command's Foreign Technology Division; subsequently, Overholser incorporated elements of Ufimtsev's work to refine the software. ECHO 1 allowed the team to quickly decide which of the 20 possible designs were optimal, finally settling on the faceted delta-wing design. However, many within the division were skeptical of the shape, giving rise to the name [...] "Hopeless Diamond"– Kelly Johnson said to Rich, [...] "Our old D-21 drone has a lower radar cross-section than that goddamn diamond".|$|E

It sought to turn out first-rate pursuit pilots who were confident, accurate flyers and excellent shots, possessing quick keen judgment.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, a {{group was}} formed for a skiing {{expedition}} across the northern Urals in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Soviet Union. Igor Dyatlov, a twenty-three-year-old <b>radio</b> <b>engineering</b> {{student at the}} Ural Polytechnical Institute (Уральский политехнический институт, УПИ; now Ural Federal University) was the leader who assembled a group of nine others for the trip, {{most of whom were}} fellow students and peers at the university. Each member of the group—which consisted of eight men and two women—were experienced Grade II-hikers with ski tour experience, and would be receiving Grade III certification upon their return. At the time, this was the highest certification available in the Soviet Union, and required candidates to traverse [...] The goal of the expedition was to reach Otorten (Отортен), a mountain [...] north of the site of the incident. This route, in February, was estimated as Category III, the most difficult.|$|E
2500|$|During the [...] "spark era" [...] the <b>radio</b> <b>engineering</b> {{profession}} gave {{credit to}} Tesla; his circuit {{became known as}} the [...] "Tesla coil" [...] or [...] "Tesla transformer". However Tesla did not benefit financially, due to competing patent claims. Marconi had claimed rights to the [...] "closed primary open secondary" [...] transmitter circuit in his controversial 1900 [...] "four circuit" [...] wireless patent. Tesla sued Marconi in 1915 for patent infringement, but didn't have the resources to pursue the action. However, in 1943, in a separate suit brought by the Marconi Company against the US government for use of its patents in World War I, the US Supreme Court invalidated Marconi's 1900 patent claim to the [...] "four circuit" [...] concept. The ruling cited the prior patents of Tesla, Lodge, and Stone, but did not decide which of these parties had rights to the circuit. By that time the issue was moot; the patent had expired in 1915 and spark transmitters had long been obsolete.|$|E
