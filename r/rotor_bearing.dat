40|$|A {{nonlinear}} coupled {{dynamic model}} of a rod fastening rotor under rub-impact and initial permanent deflection was developed in this paper. The governing motion equation was derived by the D’Alembert principle considering the contact characteristic between disks, nonlinear oil-film force, rub-impact force, unbalance mass, etc. The contact effects between disks was modeled as a flexural spring with cubical nonlinear stiffness. The coupled nonlinear dynamic phenomena of the rub-impact rod fastening <b>rotor</b> <b>bearing</b> system with initial permanent deflection were investigated by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Bifurcation diagram, vibration waveform, frequency spectrum, shaft orbit and Poincaré map are used to illustrate the rich diversity of the system response with complicated dynamics. The studies indicate that the coupled dynamic responses of the rod fastening <b>rotor</b> <b>bearing</b> system under rub-impact and initial permanent deflection exhibit a rich nonlinear dynamic diversity, synchronous periodic- 1 motion, multiple periodic motion, quasi-periodic motion and chaotic motion can be observed under certain conditions. Larger radial stiffness of the stator will simplify the system motion and make the oil whirl weaker or even disappear at a certain rotating speed. With the increase of initial permanent deflection length, the instability speed of the system gradually rises, and the chaotic motion region gets smaller and smaller. The corresponding results can provide guidance for the fault diagnosis of a rub-impact rod fastening rotor with initial permanent deflection {{and contribute to the}} further understanding of the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the rod fastening <b>rotor</b> <b>bearing</b> system...|$|E

40|$|The {{vibration}} {{analysis of}} rotating systems is pronounced {{as a key}} function in all the fields of engineering. The behavior of the rotor systems are mainly resulting from the excitations from its rotating elements. There are several numerical methods present to analyze the rotor-bearing systems. Finite element method is a key tool for dynamic analysis of <b>rotor</b> <b>bearing</b> system. The current study describes a multi disk, variable cross section rotor-bearing system with transverse crack on xisymmetric elements supported on bearings in a fixed frame. The shaft in the rotor-bearing system is assumed to obey Euler- Bernoulli beam theory. The equation of motion of the rotor-bearing system is derived by Lagrangian approach along with finite element method. Finite element model is used for vibration analysis by including rotary inertia and gyroscopic moments with consistent matrix approach. The <b>rotor</b> <b>bearing</b> system consists of two bearings and two rigid disks. One disk is overhung {{and the other one}} is placed between the bearings. Internal damping of the shaft and linear stiffness parameter of the bearings are taken into account to obtain the response of the rotor-bearing system.

The critical speed, unbalance response and natural whirls are analyzed for the typical rotor-bearing system with transverse crack.
