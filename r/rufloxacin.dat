In addition, urine levels, drug level/MIC ratio, and urine antibacterial activity 72 to 84 h after treatment initiation were determined in a subgroup of patients for pharmacodynamic assessment. A total of 203 women were included and treated in this open, randomized clinical trial; 100 patients received norfloxacin, whereas 103 received <b>rufloxacin.</b> Of these, 156 (74 and 82 patients in the norfloxacin and <b>rufloxacin</b> groups, respectively) were considered bacteriologically evaluable. At the first follow-up visits (3 to 12 days after starting the treatment), bacteriological cure rates were 99 and 94 % for norfloxacin and <b>rufloxacin,</b> respectively. Seventy-nine percent (119 of 150) of bacteriologically cured patients attended a long-term follow-up visit (4 to 6 weeks after starting the treatment), where a relapse rate of 4 % (2 of 54) and 5 % (3 of 64) were found in the norfloxacin and <b>rufloxacin</b> groups, respectively. The pharmacodynamic evaluation performed in 35 patients showed similar median urine levels (approximately equal to 25 micrograms/ml) and urine antibacterial activity for both treatment groups against initial isolates, despite a higher norfloxacin level/MIC ratio due to the lower MIC of norfloxacin. Twenty-one patients (20 %) in the <b>rufloxacin</b> group and 12 patients (12 %) in the norfloxacin group reported 39 and 16 adverse events, respectively, almost all of them being mild and lasting < 24 h. Overall, gastrointestinal reactions were the most frequent adverse events reported. However, 12 patients treated with <b>rufloxacin</b> reported 15 central nervous system adverse events.

40|$|Several {{quinolone}} antibacterial {{agents are}} known to inhibit the metabolism of theophylline, {{with the potential to}} cause adverse events due to raised theophylline concentrations during coadministration. A randomized crossover study was therefore conducted with 12 healthy male volunteers (ages, 23 to 34 years; body weight, 64 to 101 kg) to evaluate a possible interaction between <b>rufloxacin</b> and theophylline. Both drugs were administered at steady state. Following the administration of an oral loading dose of 400 mg on day 1, <b>rufloxacin</b> was given orally at 200 mg once daily on days 2 to 7 during one period only. During both periods, 146 mg of theophylline was administered orally twice daily for 3 days (which were days 4 to 6 of the <b>rufloxacin</b> coadministration period) and intravenously once the next morning to test for an interaction. Theophylline and <b>rufloxacin</b> concentrations were measured by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, the pharmacokinetics of theophylline at steady state following administration of the last dose were calculated by compartment-model-independent methods. To compare the treatments, analysis of variance-based point estimates and 90 % confidence intervals (given in parentheses) were calculated for the mean ratios of the pharmacokinetic parameters from the test (<b>rufloxacin</b> coadministration) over those from the reference (theophylline without <b>rufloxacin)</b> period. These were as follows: maximum concentration at steady state, 1. 01 (0. 96 to 1. 07); area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h, 0. 98 (0. 94 to 1. 02); half-life, 0. 99 (0. 95 to 1. 03); total clearance at steady state, 1. 02 (0. 99 to 1. 06); and volume of distribution in the elimination phase, 1. 01 (0. 97 to 1. 05).

40|$|Bacterial {{keratitis}} is {{a serious}} infectious ocular disease requiring prompt treatment to prevent frequent and severe visual disabilities. Standard treatment of bacterial keratitis includes topical administration of concentrated antibiotic solutions repeated at frequent intervals {{in order to reach}} sufficiently high drug levels in the corneal tissue to inhibit bacterial growth. However, this regimen has been associated with toxicity to the corneal epithelium and requires patient hospitalization. In the present study, a mucoadhesive polymer extracted from tamarind seeds was used for ocular delivery of 0. 3 % <b>rufloxacin</b> in the treatment of experimental Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus keratitis in rabbits. The polysaccharide significantly increased the intra-aqueous penetration of <b>rufloxacin</b> in both infected and uninfected eyes. <b>Rufloxacin</b> delivered by the polysaccharide reduced P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in the cornea at a higher rate than that obtained by <b>rufloxacin</b> alone. In particular, use of the polysaccharide allowed a substantial reduction of S. aureus in the cornea to be achieved even when the time interval between drug administrations was extended. These results suggest that the tamarind seed polysaccharide prolongs the precorneal residence times of antibiotics and enhances drug accumulation in the cornea, probably by reducing the washout of topically administered drugs.

Clinical and bacteriological assessments were carried out before treatment, between study days 3 and 5, and at days 1 and 8 after treatment. Pretreatment cultures were positive for 139 patients, the most frequently isolated pathogens being Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the aqueous humor pharmacokinetics of <b>rufloxacin</b> in rabbits after topical administration of different formulations, and to individuate the ones showing the best pharmacokinetic profile. METHODS: Six formulations were instilled in rabbit eyes: two pH 7. 2 suspensions of non-salified <b>rufloxacin</b> base, or zwitterion (RUF), {{one of which}} was viscosized with tamarind seed polysaccharide (TSP); two pH 7. 2 solutions of RUF obtained using hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (CD), {{one of which was}} viscosized with TSP; and two pH 5. 0 solutions of <b>rufloxacin</b> hydrochloride (RUF-HCl), one of which was viscosized with TSP. At different times after administration, samples of aqueous humor were withdrawn and analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of RUF in the aqueous humor produced by the different formulations were calculated and statistical differences were assessed. RESULTS: The best results, in terms of aqueous humor bioavailability, were observed with two TSP-viscosized formulations: a solution of the hydrochloride (TSP/RUF-HCl) and a suspension of the base (TSP/RUF), followed by the non-viscosized solution of RUF-HCl. The formulations containing CD-solubilized RUF were much less effective. CONCLUSIONS: The present data confirm the significant availability-enhancing properties of tamarind seed polysaccharide, and indicate that solubilization of RUF with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (CD/RUF) results in decreased drug availability with respect to standard formulations. Two of the TSP-viscosized formulations (RUF suspension and RUF-HCl solution) produced aqueous humor RUF concentrations in the range of activity against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, thus warranting further studies on applications of <b>rufloxacin</b> in ocular therapy...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the photosensitizing {{activity}} of FLQs towards two different biosubstrates, membrane and DNA. The in vitro phototoxic activity of these drugs vs. DNA presents peculiar features with respect to that vs. membranes, probably due to a specific binding of the drugs to the double helix and to the operativeness of different photosensitization mechanisms with {{the two types of}} biosubstrates. A description of the UVA photochemistry and the photosensitizing properties of two significant examples in the FLQ family is reported. The investigated compounds are Enoxacin, 1 -ethyl- 6 -fluoro- 1, 4 -dihydro- 4 - oxo- 7 -[1 -piperazinyl]- 1, 8 -naphtyridine- 3 -carboxilic acid and <b>Rufloxacin,</b> 9 -fluoro- 2, 3 -dihydro- 10 - 4 ´-methyl- 1 ´-piperazinyl- 7 -oxo- 7 H-pyrido[1, 2, 3 −de]- 1, 4 -benzothiazine- 6 -carboxylic acid...|$|E

They exist as charged molecules in 21 biological fluids and, thus, their disposition depends heavily on active transport and facilitative 22 diffusion. A recent {{review of the}} clinical literature indicated that tubular secretion and 23 reabsorption are major determinants of their half-life in plasma, efficacy, and drug-drug 24 interactions. In particular, published in vivo interactions between FQs and cationic drugs 25 affecting renal clearance implicated organic cation transporters (OCTs).

40|$|Abstract − Cimetidine, a {{substrate}} for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is a {{well known}} drug interacting {{with a variety of}} drugs and results in alteration of pharmacokinetic parameters by concomitant administration. The aim of present study was to investigate whether cimetidine affects the transport of various quinolone antibiotics in human col-orectal cancer cell line (Caco- 2) system which has been typically used to investigate drug transport via P-gp. The apparent permeability coefficients (P app) value of 9 quinolone antibiotics in the co-treatment with cimetidine was examined. Apical to basolateral (AP-to-BL) transport of fleroxacin in the co-treatment with cimetidine was increased to 1. 5 -fold (p< 0. 01) compared with that of fleroxacin alone, whereas basolateral to apical (BL-to-AP) transport of fleroxacin was decreased to 0. 83 -fold significantly (p< 0. 05). Ofloxacin was decreased to 0. 8 -fold (p< 0. 01) and 0. 72 -fold (p< 0. 01) significantly in AP-to-BL and BL-to-AP direction, respectively by cimetidine co-treatment. The P app values of gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin and <b>rufloxacin</b> also were changed by cime-tidine. These results have a potential that cimetidine influences on the pharmacokinetics of quinolone antibiotics. It suggests that careful drug monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary during the co-administration of quinolone antibiotics with cimetidine.

40|$|Quinolones rapidly kill {{bacteria}} by two mechanisms, {{one that}} requires protein synthesis {{and one that}} does not. The latter, which is measured as lethal action {{in the presence of}} the protein synthesis inhibitor chlor-amphenicol, is enhanced by N- 1 cyclopropyl and C- 8 methoxy substituents, as seen with the highly lethal compound PD 161144. In some compounds, such as levofloxacin, the N- 1 and C- 8 substituents are fused. To assess the effect of ring fusion on killing, structural derivatives of levofloxacin and PD 161144 differing at C- 7 were synthesized and examined with Escherichia coli. A fused-ring derivative of PD 161144 exhibited a striking absence of lethal activity in the presence of chloramphenicol. In general, ring fusion had little effect on lethal activity when protein synthesis was allowed, but fusion reduced lethal activity in the absence of protein synthesis to extents that depended on the C- 7 ring structure. Additional fused-ring fluoroquinolones, pazu-floxacin, marbofloxacin, and <b>rufloxacin,</b> also exhibited reduced activity in the presence of chloramphenicol. Energy minimization modeling revealed that steric interactions of the trans-oriented N- 1 cyclopropyl and C- 8 methoxy moieties skew the quinolone core, rigidly orient these groups perpendicular to core rings, and restrict the rotational freedom of C- 7 rings. These features were not observed with fused-ring derivatives. Remarkably, structural effects on quinolone lethality were not explained by the recently described X-ray crystal structures of fluoroquinolone-topoisomerase IV-DNA complexes, suggesting the existence of an additional drug-bindin...|$|E

They exist as charged molecules in biological fluids, and thus, their disposition depends heavily on active transport and facilitative diffusion. A recent review of the clinical literature indicated that tubular secretion and reabsorption are major determinants of their half-life in plasma, efficacy, and drug-drug interactions. In particular, reported in vivo interactions between FQs and cationic drugs affecting renal clearance implicated organic cation transporters (OCTs). In this study, 13 FQs, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, fleroxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, moxifloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, prulifloxacin, <b>rufloxacin,</b> and sparfloxacin, were screened for their ability to inhibit transport activity of human OCT 1 (hOCT 1) (SLC 22 A 1), hOCT 2 (SLC 22 A 2), and hOCT 3 (SLC 22 A 3). All, with the exception of enoxacin, significantly inhibited hOCT 1 -mediated uptake under initial test conditions. None of the FQs inhibited hOCT 2, and only moxifloxacin inhibited hOCT 3 (∼ 30 %), even at a 1, 000 -fold excess. Gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, prulifloxacin, and sparfloxacin were determined to be competitive inhibitors of hOCT 1. Inhibition constants (Ki) were estimated to be 250 ± 18 μM, 161 ± 19 μM, 136 ± 33 μM, and 94 ± 8 μM, respectively. Moxifloxacin competitively inhibited hOCT 3 -mediated uptake, with a Ki value of 1, 598 ± 146 μM. Despite expression in enterocytes (luminal), hepatocytes (sinusoidal), and proximal tubule cells (basolateral), hOCT 3 does not appear to contribute significantly to FQ disposition. However, hOCT 1 in the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes, and potentially the basolateral membrane of proximal tubule cells, is likely {{to play a role in}} the disposition of these antimicrobial agents...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} several reports that convulsions, {{although}} rare, occur in patients who receive fluoroquinolones. In this study, the proconvulsant effects exhibited by a novel series of 6 -desfluoroquinolones and some classic quinolones on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) -induced seizures in mice were evaluated and compared. Animals were intraperitoneally injected with vehicle or quinolone derivatives (5 to 100 μg/g of body weight) 30 min before the subcutaneous (s. c.) administration of PTZ (40 μg/g). In each experiment, mice were then observed for 1 h to monitor for the incidence and onset of clonic seizures. The order of proconvulsant activity in our epileptic model was MF 5184 > MF 5187 > pefloxacin > MF 5189 > ofloxacin > ciprofloxacin > MF 5140 > MF 5181 > MF 5137 > <b>rufloxacin</b> > MF 5143 > MF 5158 > MF 5191 > MF 5128 > MF 5138 > cinoxacin > MF 5142 > norfloxacin > nalidixic acid. The relationship between the chemical structure and the proconvulsant activity of 6 -desfluoroquinolone derivatives was studied. We observed that, in terms of toxicity to {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), besides the heterocyclic side chain (moiety) at the C- 7 position, the C- 6 substituent also appears to play an important role. In particular, a hydrogen at the C- 6 position seemed to be responsible for major neurotoxic activity in comparison to an amino group located in the same position. The relationship between lipophilicity and proconvulsant activity was also investigated. We did not find any clear relationship between a higher level of lipophilicity and major proconvulsant properties. Although the principal mechanism by which quinolones induce potentiation of the proconvulsant effects of PTZ cannot be easily determined, {{it is possible that the}} convulsions are caused by drug interactions, because both PTZ and quinolones are believed to increase excitation of the CNS by inhibition of γ-aminobutyric acid binding to receptors...|$|E
