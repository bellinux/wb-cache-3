His father had {{arranged}} the job (and similar jobs for his brother and sister) to give Barrowman the experience of manual labour. His father told him: [...] "If {{you want to do}} manual labour for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life you'll know that when you do it; it's a choice. But if you don't like it, you'll understand the importance of educating yourself and – if you decide {{what you want to do}} – being good at your craft or your skill."

500|$|In Moonwalk (1988), Jackson {{said his}} {{relationship}} with Shields was [...] "romantically serious for a while." [...] Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together. The suggestions were met with disapproval from Shields, who felt {{such a move would}} have [...] "divided [...] life too much".

I think it made him relax. He didn’t want to lose things that meant something to him." ...|$|E

He demands that Liz fire Josh, but she refuses, so instead she tries to fix the situation, but Tracy threatens to go to Jack if she does not.

500|$|The Iron Giant {{primarily}} {{deals with}} the concept of existentialism, as well as the nature of humanity.

And that plays out for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life." [...] McCanlies added that films can provide viewers with a sense of right and wrong, and expressed a wish that The Iron Giant would [...] "make us feel like we're all part of humanity [...] is something we need to feel." [...] When some critics compared the film to [...] (1982), Bird responded by saying [...] "E.T. doesn't go kicking ass. He doesn't make the Army pay.

500|$|Delany {{auditioned for}} the role of Bree for the series' pilot episode in 2004. Cherry offered her the role three times, but she {{rejected}} it, and Marcia Cross was hired soon after. Delany turned down the role because she believed the Bree character was too similar to her character on Pasadena. Cherry acknowledged that while Delany captured the slyness he had originally intended for the character, Cross ultimately became the better choice: [...] "Marcia, who {{will be the first to}} tell you, 'I'm not funny, I never get the joke,' her Bree was kind of oblivious to her own Breeness. Interestingly enough, when we went forward with the show, it became a much funnier character than I envisioned." [...] While developing the Katherine character, Cherry immediately offered the role to Delany. [...] "That's unusual in Hollywood," [...] Delany commented. [...] "Usually when you say 'no,' they hold it against you for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> career. I've experienced that." ...|$|E

500|$|Mark's {{departure}} {{was shown}} during a special real-time episode, {{which focused on}} a 30-minute timeframe. Executive producer Susan Bower revealed that the team wanted Mark [...] "to {{go out with a}} bang" [...] and commented that while the episode features about half a dozen people, it is mostly about Mark and Kate. The show's script producer, Emma Gordon, agreed that the real-time episode was [...] "the best way to do justice" [...] to the character and his exit. McGregor explained that while the producers were planning his character's exit, they took inspiration from the US drama 24. Gordon admitted to Tiffany Fox from The West Australian that the technique was a real challenge for Neighbours. She said [...] "It is a bit different and a bit out of our normal storytelling process but it gives such a sense of tension which is exactly the feeling we wanted to create.

500|$|... "What Are You Doing the <b>Rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Life?" [...] {{was written}} by French {{composer}} Michel Legrand (who would continue writing songs with Streisand for years) and Alan and Marilyn Bergman. Gold also produced it, while Peter Matz arranged the instruments and orchestration that accompanied the composition. Seventh and eighth tracks [...] "Summer Me, Winter Me" [...] and [...] "Pieces of Dreams", respectively, also feature contributions from Legrand, with the former originally created specifically for The Singer and the latter a cover of the 1970 version for the film Pieces of Dreams. [...] "I've Never Been a Woman Before" [...] is song written by Tom Baird and Ron Miller for Cherry, an unproduced musical based on the William Inge play Bus Stop. The closing song on the record is a medley of [...] "My Buddy" [...] and [...] "How About Me", from Gus Kahn, Walter Donaldson, and Irving Berlin. The {{first part of the}} melody details someone affected by the loss of a friend, particularly a soldier who died during combat, as noted by author Robert Eberwein in his 2007 book Armed Forces; Masculinity and Sexuality in the American War Film.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{following}} the commercial success of [...] "The Way We Were", Columbia Records began compiling tracks for the singer's then-upcoming fifteenth studio album. Since time was limited, the record consists of several non-album compositions recorded by Streisand, including the aforementioned title and her preceding single [...] "All in Love Is Fair" [...] (1974). According to the liner notes of her 1991 greatest hits album Just for the Record, [...] "The Way We Were", [...] "All in Love is Fair", [...] "Being at War with Each Other", and [...] "Something So Right" [...] {{were the only}} tracks specifically created for the album.

500|$|... "Everytime" [...] is a pop ballad. It {{begins with}} a music box {{introduction}} accompanying Spears's breathy vocals, which build from soft to strong through the song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, [...] "Everytime" [...] is composed in the key of E♭ major, with a tempo of 110 beats per minute. Spears's vocal range spans from the low-tone of A♭3 to the high-tone of E♭5. [...] "Everytime" [...] lyrics are a plea for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. In the song, the singer explains she feels unable to continue in lines such as [...] "Everytime I try to fly I fall / Without my wings I feel so small". Jennifer Vineyard of MTV compared the song lyrically to another ballad from In the Zone, [...] "Shadow", since they both speak [...] "about how reminders of a lover can still linger after he's gone." [...] During an interview with Jennifer Vineyard of MTV, Spears said about [...] "Everytime", [...] "It's about heartbreak, it's about your first love, your first true love. That's something all people can relate to, because you all have that first love that you think you're {{going to be with}} the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life."

500|$|IGN {{gave the}} games a 9/10, a higher rating {{than any of}} the other Nintendo DS Pokémon games. The review praised the games for {{renewing}} interest in the series, though criticized some of the new Pokémon designs, explaining that [...] "aside from a weaker lineup of monsters (largely an aesthetic complaint), this is the best Pokémon has to offer on every level, renewing my waning interest in monster battling". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized Black and White, commenting that he grew tired of it shortly after starting and feeling like it was too similar to all previous Pokémon games. He further went on to say that EVs and IVs, invisible mechanics in the game, are not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, he noted that it would be great to new players. He also compared it to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games and Final Fantasy XIII, arguing that they all share the common element of being bad before they get good. Fellow Retronauts contributor Justin Haywald criticized the games' release on the DS, which had received two main Pokémon series games published before them. GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson stated [...] "It may not break the Pokemon mold, but Black/White offers enough new content coupled with the series' classic, deep battle mechanics to make it endlessly playable. If you could only play one game for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life, this would be a wise choice." ...|$|E
500|$|Jones {{was cast}} as Rooney {{based on his}} role in Amadeus, where he played the emperor; Hughes thought that character's modern {{equivalent}} was Rooney. [...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to me was that I {{was the only one who}} wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So I was the only one in opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — and I thought he was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This is the guy I want you to pay close attention to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP's coat momentarily flew open revealing a holster and gun attached to the man's belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned."The guy was 'Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you!'" [...] Jones exclaimed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{day after}} he wrote to Burghley: [...] "Sickness and {{mortality}} begins wonderfully to grow amongst us; {{and it is a}} most pitiful sight to see...how the men, having no place to receive them into here, die in the streets. I am driven myself, of force, to come a-land, to see them bestowed in some lodging; and the best I can get is barns and such outhouses; and the relief is small that I can provide for them here. It would grieve any man's heart to see them that have served so valiantly to die so miserably".
