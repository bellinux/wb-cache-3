25|$|Besides, <b>Rosiglitazone</b> (Avandia) {{improves}} {{memory and}} thinking ability {{for people with}} mild Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism of the effect may be {{the ability of the}} drug to reduce insulin resistance. Thus, less insulin needs to be released to achieve its metabolic effects. Insulin in the bloodstream is a trigger of amyloid beta-production, so decreased insulin levels decrease the level of amyloid beta. This leads to less formation of amyloid plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
500|$|A {{combination}} of metformin and <b>rosiglitazone</b> {{was released in}} 2002 and sold as Avandamet by GlaxoSmithKline. By 2009 it had become the most popular metformin combination. In 2005, the stock of Avandamet {{was removed from the}} market, after inspections showed the factory where it was produced was violating good manufacturing practices. The drug pair continued to be prescribed separately and Avandamet was again available {{by the end of that}} year. A generic formulation of metformin/rosiglitazone from Teva received tentative approval from the FDA and reached the market in early 2012. However, following a meta-analysis in 2007 that linked the drug's use to an increased risk of heart attack, [...] concerns were raised over the safety of medicines containing <b>rosiglitazone.</b> In September 2010 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended that the drug be suspended from the European market because the benefits of <b>rosiglitazone</b> no longer outweighed the risks. It was withdrawn from the market in the UK and India in 2010, and in New Zealand and South Africa in 2011. From November 2011 until November 2013 the FDA did not allow <b>rosiglitazone</b> or metformin/rosiglitazone to be sold without a prescription; moreover, makers were required to notify patients of the risks associated with its use, and the drug had to be purchased by mail order through specified pharmacies. In November 2013, the FDA lifted its earlier restrictions on <b>rosiglitazone</b> after reviewing the results of the 2009 RECORD clinical trial (a six-year, open label randomized control trial), which failed to show elevated risk of heart attack or death associated with the drug.|$|E

2500|$|Concerns {{about the}} safety of <b>rosiglitazone</b> arose when a {{retrospective}} meta-analysis was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. There have been a significant number of publications since then, and a Food and Drug Administration panel voted, with some controversy, 20:3 that available studies [...] "supported a signal of harm," [...] but voted 22:1 to keep the drug on the market. The meta-analysis was not supported by an interim analysis of the trial designed to evaluate the issue, and several other reports have failed to conclude the controversy. This weak evidence for adverse effects has reduced the use of <b>rosiglitazone,</b> despite its important and sustained effects on glycemic control. Safety studies are continuing.|$|E
2500|$|... mTOR, {{specifically}} mTOR1, {{was first}} shown to important in ageing in 2003, {{in a study}} on worms; sirolimus was shown to inhibit and slow aging in worms, yeast, and flies, and then to improve the condition of mouse models of various diseases of aging. [...] Sirolimus was first shown to extend lifespan in wild-type mice in a study published by NIH investigators in 2009; the studies have been replicated in mice of many different genetic backgrounds. The results are further supported by the finding that genetically modified mice with impaired mTOR1 signalling live longer. The known adverse effects caused by sirolimus and marketed analogs, especially the increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression, as well as dose-dependent metabolic impairment, make it unlikely that this could become a widely used anti-aging agent. Among the strategies that have been explored to minimize such side effects are intermittent treatment regimens and combinations with insulin sentitizers (<b>rosiglitazone)</b> or antidiabetics (metformin) to prevent metabolic dysfunction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rosiglitazone</b> {{was thought}} to be able to benefit {{patients}} with Alzheimer's disease who do not express the ApoE4 allele, but the phase III trial designed to test this showed that <b>rosiglitazone</b> was ineffective in all patients, including ApoE4-negative patients.|$|E
50|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 16 observational studies released in March, 2011, compared <b>rosiglitazone</b> to pioglitazone, finding support for greater cardiovascular safety for pioglitazone. The meta-analysis involved 810 000 patients taking <b>rosiglitazone</b> or pioglitazone. The study suggests 170 excess myocardial infarctions, 649 excess cases of heart failure, and 431 excess deaths for every 100 000 patients who receive <b>rosiglitazone</b> rather than pioglitazone. This {{was confirmed by}} another meta-analysis involving 945 286 patients in 8 retrospective cohort studies, most in the US.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 John Buse, a {{diabetes}} specialist, told medical conferences that <b>rosiglitazone</b> might {{carry an}} increased risk of cardiovascular problems. GSK threatened to sue him, called his university head of department, and persuaded him to sign a retraction. GSK raised questions internally about the drug's safety in 2000, and in 2002 the company ghostwrote an article in Circulation describing a GSK-funded clinical trial that suggested <b>rosiglitazone</b> might have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk. From 2001 reports began to link the thiazolidinediones (the class of drugs to which <b>rosiglitazone</b> belongs) to heart failure. In April that year GSK began a six-year, open-label, randomized trial, known as RECORD, to examine <b>rosiglitazone</b> and cardiovascular events. Two GSK meta-analyses in 2005 and 2006 showed {{an increased risk}} of cardiovascular problems with rosiglitazone; the information was passed to the FDA and posted on the company website, but not otherwise published. By December 2006 <b>rosiglitazone</b> had become the top-selling diabetes drug, with annual sales of US$3.3 billion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rosiglitazone</b> {{also appears}} to have an {{anti-inflammatory}} effect {{in addition to its}} effect on insulin resistance. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), a signaling molecule, stimulates the inflammatory pathways. NF-κB inhibitor (IκB) downregulates the inflammatory pathways. When patients take <b>rosiglitazone,</b> NF-κB levels fall and IκB levels increase.|$|E
50|$|In July 2007 the FDA held a {{joint meeting}} of the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee. FDA {{scientist}} Joy Mele presented a meta analysis examining the cardiovascular risk of <b>rosiglitazone</b> in completed clinical trials. The study found an overall 1.4x increase in risk of cardiovascular ischemic events relative to the control arms. The results were heterogenous, with clear evidence of increased risk relative to placebo but not relative to other diabetes treatments and higher risk associated with combinations of <b>rosiglitazone</b> with insulin or metformin. Based on the 1.4x increased risk relative to control groups, FDA scientist David Graham presented an analysis suggesting that <b>rosiglitazone</b> had caused 83,000 excess heart attacks between 1999 and 2007. The advisory panel voted 20 : 3 that the evidence available indicated that <b>rosiglitazone</b> increased the risk of cardiovascular events and 22 : 1 that the overall risk:benefit ratio of <b>rosiglitazone</b> justified its continued marketing in the United States. The FDA placed restrictions on the drug, including adding a boxed warning about heart attacks, but did not withdraw it.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2010, the FDA's {{associate}} director of drug safety, recommended <b>rosiglitazone</b> {{be taken off the}} market. In June 2010, they published a retrospective study comparing roziglitazone to pioglitazone, the other thiazolidinedione marketed in the United States and concluded <b>rosiglitazone</b> was associated with [...] "an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality and an increased risk of the composite of AMI, stroke, heart failure, or all-cause mortality in patients 65 years or older". The number needed to harm with roziglitazone was sixty. Graham argued <b>rosiglitazone</b> caused 500 more heart attacks and 300 more heart failures than its main competitor.|$|E
50|$|Though older studies {{suggested}} {{there may}} be an increased risk of coronary heart disease and heart attacks with <b>rosiglitazone,</b> pioglitazone treatment, in contrast, has shown significant protection from both micro- and macro-vascular cardiovascular events and plaque progression. These studies led to a period of Food and Drug Administration advisories (2007 - 2013) that, aided by extensive media coverage, led to a substantial decrease in <b>rosiglitazone</b> use. In November 2013, the FDA announced it would remove the usage restrictions for <b>rosiglitazone</b> in patients with coronary artery disease. The new recommendations were largely based on the reasoning that prior meta-analyses leading to the original restrictions were not designed to assess cardiac outcomes and, thus, not uniformly collected or adjudicated. In contrast, one of the largest trials (RECORD trial) that was specifically designed to assess cardiac outcomes found no increased risk of myocardial infarction with <b>rosiglitazone</b> use, even after independent re-evaluation for FDA review.|$|E
5000|$|A {{meta-analysis}} in May 2007 {{reported the}} use of <b>rosiglitazone</b> {{was associated with a}} 1.4 fold increased risk of heart attack and a numerically higher (but non-significant) increase in risk of death from all cardiovascular diseases against control. It contained 42 trials of which 27 were unpublished. Another meta analysis of 4 trials with follow-up longer than 1 year found similar results. Nissen's meta analysis was criticized in an 2007 article by George Diamond et al in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The authors concluded that Nissens' analysis had excluded trials with important data on the cardiovascular profile of <b>rosiglitazone,</b> had inappropriately combined trials of greatly differing design, and had inappropriately excluded trials with no cardiovascular events. The authors concluded that no firm conclusion could be drawn regarding whether <b>rosiglitazone</b> increased or decreased cardiovascular risk. [...] Investigators from the Cochrane Collaboration published a meta-analysis of their own on {{the use of}} <b>rosiglitazone</b> in Type II diabetes, concluding there was not sufficient evidence to show any health benefit for <b>rosiglitazone.</b> Noting the recent publication by Nissen, they repeated their meta analysis including only the trials included in the Nissen study that dealt with Type II diabetics. (The Nissen study included some trials in people with other disorders.) They did not find a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular events, but noted that all of the cardiovascular endpoints they analyzed showed a non-significant trend toward worse outcomes in the <b>rosiglitazone</b> arms.|$|E
50|$|A meta {{analysis}} of all trials from 2010 confirmed {{a higher risk}} of heart failure and a double risk when <b>rosiglitazone</b> was administered as add-on therapy to insulin. Two meta analyses of real life cohortstudies found {{a higher risk of}} heart failure against pioglitazone. There were 649 excess cases of heart failure every 100,000 patients who receive <b>rosiglitazone</b> rather than pioglitazone.|$|E

50|$|The 2012 {{settlement}} {{included a}} criminal fine of $242,612,800 {{for failing to}} report safety data to the FDA about Avandia (<b>rosiglitazone),</b> a diabetes drug approved in 1999, and a civil settlement of $657 million for making false claims about it. The Justice Department said GSK had promoted <b>rosiglitazone</b> to physicians with misleading information, including that it conferred cardiovascular benefits despite an FDA-mandated label warning of cardiovascular risks.|$|E
