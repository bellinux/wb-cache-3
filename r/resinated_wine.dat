25|$|The early Greek {{settlers}} {{brought a}} distinctly Mediterranean outlook to viticulture in Gaul. To their understanding, vines grew {{best in the}} same climate and area that would support olive and fig trees, therefore most of the early vineyard planting was in the warm, Mediterranean coastal areas. In 7 BC, the Greek geographer Strabo noted that the areas around Massilia and Narbo could produce the same fruits as Italy {{but the rest of}} Gaul further north could not support the olive, fig or vine. Under Roman rule, in the century and a half BC, the majority of the wine consumed in the area was required by law to be Italian in origin, as the distribution of fragments of wine amphorae found throughout Gaul after about 100 BC, especially along the coasts and rivers, suggests: some of the earliest amphorae, from the 2nd century BC, bear Iberian shipper's marks, indicating that distribution of wine predated conquest. It wasn't till the first century AD that there was record of Gaul's wine being of any note or renown.

50|$|The hard {{transparent}} resins, {{such as the}} copals, dammars, mastic, and sandarac, are principally {{used for}} varnishes and adhesives, while the softer odoriferous oleo-resins (frankincense, elemi, turpentine, copaiba), and gum resins containing essential oils (ammoniacum, asafoetida, gamboge, myrrh, and scammony) are more used for therapeutic purposes and incense.

50|$|<b>Resinated</b> <b>wine</b> {{is a type}} of wine which derives part of its flavor from {{exposure}} to tree resins, most generally pine resin. Prior to the widespread use of barrels in Europe, wine was stored in amphorae, often sealed with Aleppo pine resin. Wines thus sealed were flavored by the resin, and over time this became a feature of the wine itself rather than an unwanted side effect.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} form of <b>resinated</b> <b>wine</b> today is Greek retsina (ρετσίνα), which for over 2000 years has been {{produced}} in and exported from Greece, particularly around Attica, Boeotia and Euboea. The European Union treats the name [...] "retsina" [...] as a protected designation of origin and a traditional appellation for Greece and parts of the southern regions of Cyprus. A South Australian wine style can be called [...] "resinated wine" [...] but not [...] "retsina".|$|E

Pietro Casola, an Italian noble who traveled to Jerusalem in 1494, wrote about the wines and cuisines of the places he stopped at along the way. In one of his entries, about his visit to Modone on Peloponnese, he wrote about the bounty of good quality wines made from Malmsey, Muscatel and Rumney varieties. Everything he tried was pleasing, except the strong, <b>resinated</b> <b>wine</b> with an unpleasant odor.|$|E

50|$|Retsina (Ρετσίνα) is a Greek white (or rosé) <b>resinated</b> <b>wine,</b> {{which has}} been made for at least 2000 years. Its unique flavor {{is said to have}} {{originated}} from the practice of sealing wine vessels, particularly amphorae, with Aleppo Pine resin in ancient times. Before the invention of impermeable glass bottles, oxygen caused many wines to spoil within the year. Pine resin helped keep air out, {{while at the same time}} infusing the wine with resin aroma. The Romans began to use barrels in the 3rd century AD, removing any oenological necessity for resin, but the flavor itself was so popular that the style is still widespread today.|$|E
5000|$|The Roman {{settlements}} in Illyria, Cisalpine Gaul and Gallia Narbonensis {{did not use}} resin-coated amphorae {{due to the lack}} of suitable local pine trees and began to develop solid, less leak-prone wooden barrels in the 1st century AD. By the 3rd century, barrel making was prevalent throughout the Roman Empire. The exception was the eastern empire regions of Byzantium which had developed a taste for the strong, pungent wine and continued to produce <b>resinated</b> <b>wine</b> long after the western Roman empire stopped. The difference in taste between the two empires took center stage in the work of the historian Liutprand of Cremona and his Relatio de Legatione Constantinopolitana. In 968, Liutprand was sent to Constantinople to arrange a marriage between the daughter of the late Emperor Romanos II and the future Holy Roman Emperor Otto II. According to Liutprand, he was treated very rudely and in an undignified manner by the court of Nikephoros II, being served goat stuffed with onion and served in fish sauce and [...] "undrinkable" [...] wine mixed with resin, pitch and gypsum—very offensive to his Germanic tastes.|$|E
50|$|There is archaeological {{evidence}} to suggest that the Celts first cultivated the grape vine, Vitis vinifera, in Gaul. Grape pips have been found throughout France, pre-dating Greek and Roman cultural influences, with some examples found near Lake Geneva being over 12,000 years old. A major turning-point in the wine history of Gaul came with the founding of Massalia in the 6th century BC by Greek immigrants from Phocae in Asia Minor. By the 2nd century BC, Massalia (by then known as Massilia) came under Roman influence as a vital port on the trade route linking Rome to Roman settlements at Saguntum (near what is now modern Valencia in Spain). Roman presence and influence in Massilia grew as the settlement came under attack from a succession of forces including the Ligurians, Allobroges and Arverni. Eventually the area became a Roman province first known as Provincia and later Gallia Narbonensis.The early Greek settlers brought a distinctly Mediterranean outlook to viticulture in Gaul. To their understanding, vines grew best in the same climate and area that would support olive and fig trees, therefore most of the early vineyard planting was in the warm, Mediterranean coastal areas.
