25|$|The CRTC {{met with}} the various {{telecommunications}} providers in Canada and required of them to implement a Service Improvement Plan (SIP). This meant that MTS had to improve service to northern remote areas that even by the 21st century had poor quality phone service. Customers in northern Manitoba complained that the microwave system could not handle data communications (modem, fax) well. This, {{as well as the}} collapse of a microwave <b>relay</b> <b>tower</b> linking Churchill in early January 2000, lead MTS to initiate upgrades to the Radisson-Churchill corridor with fibre optics and the Lynn Lake-Thompson corridor with a digital microwave system to replace the outdated equipment.|$|E

25|$|A major {{electricity}} substation, {{operated by}} Integral Energy, {{is located at}} the corner of Pennant Hills Road and Jenkins Road. The same site also houses one of the major communications <b>relay</b> <b>towers</b> in northern Sydney. The substation previously had a rail siding from the adjacent Carlingford Line; the siding was opened in 1954, and closed in the late 1980s.|$|R

50|$|The video {{would go}} from the camera to the control truck via the cable, then to an 80 ft <b>relay</b> <b>tower</b> 1000 ft back in the woods, then 35 mi to another <b>relay</b> <b>tower,</b> then 40 mi to a third tower before being sent to Memphis. There it was {{transmitted}} 1200 mi to New York where the audio and video were combined to be broadcast live. With the electronics in place, {{the only thing left}} was to make sure that at an exact prearranged time there would be ducks {{in front of the cameras}} — over a quarter-of-a-million ducks.|$|E
50|$|To the north-west of Mount Duval sits Little Mount Duval, with an {{elevation}} of 1404 m above sea level, slightly higher than Mount Duval. When viewed from Armidale, Little Mount Duval appears much smaller and was so named accordingly. On the summit of Little Mount Duval sit the transmission <b>relay</b> <b>towers</b> {{for a number of}} radio and television stations that broadcast into Armidale.|$|R
5000|$|Eastlink was not, as of November 2011, {{effectively}} held to its {{contractual obligation}} to provide [...] "100% of civic addresses" [...] with service nor its latency promises, even where most such customers {{could be easily}} accommodated by extending its wired network to these existing wireless <b>relay</b> <b>towers.</b> In particular, users on islands with water access were denied service as of summer 2011.|$|R
50|$|No {{ski resorts}} are found on this {{mountain}} range, {{but there are}} beautiful caves {{to be seen in}} the north. A highway passes over the mountain range connecting traffic from southwestern to {{the eastern part of the}} island is one of the few roads going into the mountain range. Approximately 3,000 to 4,000 people live on the slopes of Ainos. Multiple television and cell phone <b>relay</b> <b>towers</b> occupy the summit.|$|R
50|$|The Turin {{transmitter}} building remains standing, but no broadcast {{station has}} operated there since WVBN went silent and radio service {{has never been}} restored to the town. The site now houses a microwave <b>relay</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, WNMC boosted {{their power}} {{once more to}} 600 watts and moved to its current frequency, 90.7. The station now {{broadcasts}} from the <b>relay</b> <b>tower</b> of WPBN-TV 7 & 4, Traverse City's NBC station.|$|E
50|$|In July 2016, Member for Lismore Thomas George {{announced}} that Ten FM would be receiving a $5000 grant to install an additional <b>relay</b> <b>tower</b> at Drake enabling {{the station to}} provide more reliable coverage for the Drake area.|$|E
50|$|Cost sharing was {{a feature}} of the program. The benefitting {{customer}} paid a portion of the charges, usually the first $1,000 of usually the first $25,000. If the cost exceeded $25,000 to serve a customer, the customer was usually responsible to pay $1,000 plus any cost that exceeded $25,000. Such high cost was rare, and usually only occurred where the telephone company needed to install new microwave <b>relay</b> <b>towers</b> to service the customer.|$|R
50|$|The PDL site {{handled the}} voice and data {{tracking}} functions {{during the time that}} MILA was blocked by the SRB exhaust plume, which occurred from one minute after launch until 2½ minutes after launch. PDL continued to track the shuttle during the times that MILA was the primary link. Microwave <b>relay</b> <b>towers</b> in Shiloh, Florida and Wilson, Florida linked the data from PDL back to MILA where it was compared to the MILA tracking data as a redundancy measure.|$|R
50|$|Arthur Collins {{was among}} the first to predict the coming {{computer}} and telecommunication revolution, and led his engineers to combine the lessons of KINEPLEX with communication expertise to establish in the early 1960s a data and message switching facility in Cedar Rapids, using Collins C8400 computers to process reservation and other data traffic for the airlines. Collins Radio also designed and built microwave communications systems, supplying both the basic equipment and also <b>relay</b> <b>towers,</b> often in remote, mountain top locations, to transmit the line-of-sight signal over long distances.|$|R
5000|$|The WHJM {{transmitter}} {{is located}} {{to the north}} in nearby Botkins...at the Microwave radio <b>relay</b> <b>tower</b> site (formerly used by AT&T Long Lines) on West State Street (with the Hogg horn antennas removed prior to WHJM's 2006 sign-on.) ...|$|E
50|$|Looking to divest {{itself of}} the surplus property, AT&T sold Redonda Mesa back to the Sharp Family Trust in 2002. The trust then sold it to Herb Massinger, who {{intended}} to remodel the site's unique microwave <b>relay</b> <b>tower</b> into a residence.|$|E
50|$|A {{small portion}} of the {{northern}} slopes are within Storm King State Park, but most of the mountain is on USMA property and thus generally off limits to the public (it is fenced off along Route 9W). There is a television <b>relay</b> <b>tower</b> located near the summit.|$|E
50|$|The true {{summit is}} the South Eastern hummock, much degraded. Views from here {{are of the}} Pacific Ocean to the West, and other ridges and peaks of the Santa Monica Mountains to the East and West. There is a second summit reached by private road, to the Northwest, with a wire-fenced {{compound}} of numerous radio <b>relay</b> <b>towers.</b> At the far end beyond the compound is a house site foundation in disrepair. This slope burned in 1989. Beyond and below that is a private road back down to Stunt Road, with private residences below.|$|R

50|$|At the time, {{the station}} had a sales office in Canada {{and was able}} to {{convince}} advertisers in Ontario to buy ads. The Ottawa cable companies eventually dropped WWNY and set up a series of microwave <b>relay</b> <b>towers</b> to carry American networks from affiliates in Rochester, New York. These were later replaced by satellite feeds from Detroit. For many years, WWNY's largest viewership was in Kingston because for nearly twenty years it was the only reliable over-the-air analog signal aside from CKWS-TV, at the time the local CBC Television affiliate. Prior to 2005, WWNY was also carried on cable in Belleville, Ontario.|$|R
50|$|Following {{an almost}} flat terrain the route breaks through a beech. As soon as having entered the beech the trail {{deviates}} to the left. The wood is crossed by a diagonal footway that ends {{on the road}} which ascends to the <b>relay</b> <b>tower</b> located on the summit.|$|E
50|$|Also on the Fourvière hill is La Tour Métallique {{which was}} privately {{built by the}} owners of the land to rival the Eiffel Tower in Paris. It forms the highest point in Lyon and is in fact higher than the Eiffel Tower at its summit, due to it being on a hill. It is now a {{television}} <b>relay</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|E
50|$|From 1975 to 1978, CFS Aldergrove {{once again}} {{underwent}} major building and upgrading programmes {{to meet the}} operational and support needs of the fleet. This included {{the addition of a}} microwave radio <b>relay</b> <b>tower,</b> providing over-the-horizon communications. The station was again upgraded in the mid 1990s replacing older, maintenance-intensive equipment with modern and more reliable electronics.|$|E
25|$|In the 2005 novel Dead Lines by Greg Bear, a {{new type}} of analog cell phone called Trans with global reach, {{requiring}} no network of <b>relay</b> <b>towers,</b> is promoted by the book's protagonist, Peter Russell. The technology utilized by Trans uses the nearly unlimited quantum bandwidth by which subatomic particles communicate with each other, and when users of Trans begin to see ghosts, Peter gradually discovers that Trans has tapped into a channel where human memories are stored and survive the death of the body. Unfortunately, Trans has made a noise and awakened nameless things much older than human beings, who feed on souls and memories.|$|R
50|$|However, {{military}} operations in Desert Storm in 1992, as well as Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in 2001 and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 revealed inadequacies in MSE to support highly mobile and dispersed forces in a digital environment. Before the widespread availability of satellite communications technology, battlefield communications required the installation and maintenance of <b>relay</b> <b>towers</b> and cables, limiting range and flexibility of missions. The outdated MSE could no longer {{keep up with the}} pace of battle. WIN-T was conceived to solve this problem and to enable mobile mission command on the battlefield. The systems development and integration for Project Manager WIN-T began in 2002.|$|R
50|$|Bamaga Road now {{bypasses}} the overland {{telegraph line}} (OTL) track, {{which is often}} referred to as the tele track. The tele track was used for construction and maintenance of the OTL until it was superseded by first microwave <b>relay</b> <b>towers</b> and then by fibre optic cables, and is now used by four-wheel drive vehicle enthusiasts in the dry season. Many crossings, such as the bridge over the Wenlock near Moreton station, have been upgraded; however, many fords remain. The roads are unsealed and in places are difficult to traverse. They are considered suitable for four-wheel-drive vehicles only and also considered only suitable to be driven in the dry season.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2015, KLTA began {{broadcasting}} in HD, {{making them}} the second commercial {{station in the}} Fargo-Moorhead market running HD Radio after sister station KBVB. A week later on March 15, 2015, KLTA launched a rhythmic CHR formatted HD2 sub-channel called [...] "Hits 96.9" [...] with a translator on W245CM 96.9 operated from the STL <b>relay</b> <b>tower</b> outside the KLTA studio in Fargo.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Second Tower of Ar tonelico", {{administrated}} by Frelia, {{was constructed}} to be a <b>relay</b> <b>tower</b> for the First, {{but due to}} its incomplete status, all of the Reyvateils in Metafalss, excepting for the IPDs, are instead connected to the First Tower in Sol Ciel through the Symphonic Power relay satellite [...] "Sol Marta". On the other hand, the IPD Reyvateils use [...] "Infel Phira" [...] as their Song Server.|$|E
50|$|Also at {{the peak}} stands a 93-metre-high Deutsche Telekom VHF and {{microwave}} radio <b>relay</b> <b>tower.</b> The tower is a reinforced concrete Typenturm, built in 1985. The following radio stations are broadcast from this tower: SWR1 Baden-Württemberg (89.2 FM/8.4 kW), SWR2 (92.6 FM/8.4 kW), SWR3 (97.0 FM/8,4 kW), Deutschlandfunk (105.1 FM/10 kW), Radio Regenbogen (101.1 FM/8,4 kW) und baden.fm (106.0 FM/8,4 kW). The tower is also used by the amateur radio repeater DB0YE.|$|E

25|$|The first {{program and}} movie {{distributed}} on the channel, the 1971 film Sometimes a Great Notion, starring Paul Newman and Henry Fonda, was transmitted that evening to 325 Service Electric subscribers in Wilkes-Barre (a plaque commemorating {{this event is}} located at Public Square in downtown Wilkes-Barre). Home Box Office distributed its first sports event immediately after the film: an NHL hockey game between the New York Rangers and the Vancouver Canucks from Madison Square Garden. Four months later in February 1973, Home Box Office aired its first television special, the Pennsylvania Polka Festival. Home Box Office would use a network of microwave <b>relay</b> <b>towers</b> to distribute its programming to cable systems throughout its service area.|$|R
50|$|As radio prospered {{throughout}} the 1920s and 1930s, experimental television stations, which broadcast both an audio {{and a video}} signal, began sporadic broadcasts. Licenses for these experimental stations were often granted to experienced radio broadcasters, and thus advances in television technology closely followed breakthroughs in radio technology. As interest in television grew, and as early television stations began regular broadcasts, the idea of networking television signals (sending one station's video and audio signal to outlying stations) was born. However, the signal from an electronic television system, containing much more information than a radio signal (6 MHz), required a broadband transmission medium. Transmission by a nationwide series of radio <b>relay</b> <b>towers</b> would be possible but extremely expensive.|$|R
