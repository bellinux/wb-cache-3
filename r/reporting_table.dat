40|$|In this {{tutorial}} we {{illustrate how}} {{to create your own}} user-defined FORMATS, INFORMATS, and PICTURE FORMAS. We describe the many applications of user-defined FORMATS including extracting data, assigning values to variables, <b>reporting,</b> <b>table</b> look-ups, and extracting data based on keys without sorting data. We also point out the quirks of the FORMAT procedure, such as why you need to watch your fuzz factor, how to generate FORMATS from CNTLIN data sets, watching out when using the w. d INFORMATS on formatted variables without decimal points, and how to use the MULT and ROUND options in creating PICTURE FORMATS. After this tutorial, you too will say, “I can do that with PROC FORMAT. ” INTRODUCTION TO INFORMATS AND FORMATS Informats are used to read data into SAS and formats are used to write out data to files and/or reports. Let’s {{take a look at some}} examples. We can specify INFORMATS in an INPUT statement to read data of many INFORMATS (character, numeric, and date). Here is an example reading data using INFORMATS: options nocenter...|$|E
