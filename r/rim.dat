5|$|Fossil Springs, {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, issues from several vents in close {{proximity}} to one another {{at the base of the}} Mogollon <b>Rim.</b> The <b>rim</b> is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Water percolating through limestone layers in the <b>rim</b> becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate. When the water emerges at the springs, it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine, a porous form of calcite often found around hot springs such as Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|E

40|$|The {{fine-grained}} opaque matrix and chondrule <b>rims</b> in the Semarkona (LL 3) chondrite {{have been}} investigated in detail with the scanning electron microscope. The chemical analyses {{were made by the}} SEM-EDS technique. Although the <b>rims</b> have similarities in texture and composition to the matrix, they show wider variabilities in chemical composition in comparison with the matrix in Semarkona. Based on both mode of occurrence and Al/Si ratio, the fine-grained opaque <b>rims</b> in Semarkona are classified into three types : type I, type IIa and type IIb. Type-I <b>rims</b> commonly occur as chondrule-rimming materials, having high Al/Si ratios. Type-I <b>rims</b> are composed mostly of smectite, showing a wider variation of the FeO and Al_ 2 O_ 3 contents than that of the matrix. Type-IIa <b>rims</b> occur as magnetite-bearing chondrule <b>rims,</b> characterized by their low Al/Si ratios. They are composed of mixtures of smectite, fayalitic material and its alteration products. Metal-sulfide-magnetite aggregates have opaque <b>rims</b> (type IIb) with the lowest Al/Si ratios. The SiO_ 2,Al_ 2 O_ 3 and FeO contents of type-IIb <b>rims</b> suggest that they consist mainly of fayalitic material and its alteration products. In compositon, it is suggested that 2 ̆ 7 fayalitic 2 ̆ 7 material and its alteration products in types-IIa and IIb <b>rims</b> correspond to one of the non-refractory, SiO_ 2 -, FeO-rich components of precursor materials of the chondrules in Semarkona. The 2 ̆ 7 fayalitic 2 ̆ 7 material might have formed through intensive fractional condensation of forsterite in the cooling nebula gas...|$|R
40|$|Chemically and microstructurally complex altered <b>rims</b> around grains in {{the finest}} size {{fraction}} (< 20 micron) {{of the lunar}} regolith {{are the result of}} multi-stage processes involving both solar ion radiation damage and nanoscale deposition of impact or sputter-derived vapors.

Recent application of field-emission scanning transmission electron microscope techniques, including energy dispersive X-ray spectral imaging, is making it easier to unravel the "nano-stratigraphy" of grain <b>rims,</b> and to delineate the portions of <b>rims</b> that represent Radiation-Amorphized (RA) host grain from overlying amorphous material that represents vapor/sputter deposits.

5|$|Eastman Kodak sued Apple and Research In Motion (<b>RIM)</b> in January 2010, filing two {{lawsuits}} against Apple and {{a complaint with}} the U.S. International Trade Commission against both Apple and <b>RIM</b> after the companies refused to pay royalties for use of Kodak's patents for digital cameras. Kodak alleged Apple's and RIM's phones infringed on patented Kodak digital imaging technology. Kodak sought an injunction against further imports into the United States of Apple's iPhone and RIM's BlackBerry. After Kodak filed an additional suit in January 2012 against Apple and another against HTC claiming infringement of four of its key patents, Apple filed a countersuit with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to block Kodak's efforts to use the disputed patents as collateral for loans. In the January complaint Kodak claimed violations of the same image preview technology at issue in the original dispute between Kodak, Apple, and <b>RIM</b> that is, as of 2012, pending before ITC. In March 2012, bankruptcy court judge Allen Gropper, overseeing Kodak's restructuring, denied Apple's request to file a patent complaint with the ITC over some of Kodak's cameras, photo frames, and printers. In July 2012, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Kodak did not infringe on Apple's patent technology for digital cameras, although a few days earlier Kodak lost its case before the ITC against Apple and RIM; Kodak announced it would appeal that decision.|$|E

40|$|Recrystallization <b>rims</b> are {{a common}} feature of zircon {{crystals}} that underwent metamorphism. We present a microstructural and microchemical study of partially recrystallized zircon grains collected in polymetamorphic migmatites (Valle d'Arbedo, Ticino, Switzerland). The <b>rims</b> are bright in cathodo-luminescence (CL), with sharp and convex contacts characterized by inward-penetrating embayments transgressing igneous zircon cores. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) data and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging indicate that the <b>rims</b> are chemically and microstructurally different from the cores. The <b>rims</b> are strongly depleted in REE, with concentrations up to two orders of magnitude lower than in the cores, indicating a significant loss of REE during zircon recrystallization. Enrichment in non-formula elements, such as Ca, has not been observed in the <b>rims.</b> The microstructure of zircon cores shows a dappled intensity at and below the 100 nm scale, possibly due to radiation damage. Other defects such as pores and dislocations are absent in the core except at healed cracks. Zircon <b>rims</b> are mostly dapple-free, but contain nanoscale pores and strain centers, interpreted as fluid inclusions and chemical residues, respectively. Sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) U-Pb ages show that the recrystallization of the <b>rims</b> took place > 200 Ma ago when the parent igneous zircon was not metamict. The chemical composition and the low-Ti content of the <b>rims</b> indicate that they form at sub-solidus temperatures (550 - 650 degrees C). Recrystallization <b>rims</b> in Valle d'Arbedo zircon are interpreted {{as the result of}} the migration of chemical reaction fronts in which fluid triggered in situ and contemporaneous interface-coupled dissolution-reprecipitation mechanisms. This study indicates that strong lattice strain resulting from the incorporation of a large amount of impurities and structural defects is not a necessary condition for zircon to recrystallize. Our observations suggest that the early formation of recrystallization <b>rims</b> played a major role in preserving zircon from the more recent Alpine metamorphic overprint...|$|R

5|$|Formation of {{approximately}} the current {{depth of the}} Colorado River's Grand Canyon by 1.2 mya further caused its tributaries to cut down even deeper. Headward erosion {{of one of those}} tributaries, the Paria River, eroded north-northwestward toward what is now Paria Amphitheater. The river took a route roughly parallel to and east of the Paunsaugunt Fault. Erosion from snow and rain that fall directly on the east-facing <b>rim</b> of the Paunsaugunt Plateau forms gullies that widen into alcoves and amphitheaters while differential erosion and frost wedging create the hoodoos. Streams on the plateau do not contribute to the formation of alcoves or amphitheaters because they flow away from the <b>rim.</b> Erosion continues in this fashion today.|$|E
