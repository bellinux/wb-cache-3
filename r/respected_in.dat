5|$|In Vietnam and Ghana, {{among other}} places, whales hold {{a sense of}} divinity. They are so <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> their {{cultures}} that they occasionally hold funerals for beached whales, a throwback to Vietnam's ancient sea-based Austro-Asiatic culture. The god of the seas, according to Chinese folklore, was a large whale with human limbs.|$|E

An {{inheritance}} from his mother, his earnings on the Stock Exchange {{and the success of}} investments he had made in Australia left him affluent—his knowledge of Australian markets was <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> the City. In 1965, Allen underwent the first of four hip operations spread over the following 14 years; he believed that his fast bowling may have brought about his hip problems.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from his}} death, remarkably {{little is known}} of Cooke's circumstances. Even his date of birth is unclear, and unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> his {{profession}} and following his death {{was the subject of}} tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in St Paul's Cathedral and his local church in Wiltshire.|$|E

He {{continued to be}} highly <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> Indonesian film circles, but was displeased with {{the condition of the}} country's film industry, which he considered {{to be on the verge}} of collapse. This he blamed on American cultural imperialism, which meant that most cinemas preferred screening foreign films, especially those from Hollywood, and that Indonesian youth were no longer creating a uniquely Indonesia identity.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon, who {{had been}} well <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> Egypt and had earned himself the {{nickname}} Sultan el-Kebir (the Great Sultan) among the people of Cairo, lost their admiration and was no longer so addressed. In March 1800, French General Jean Baptiste Kléber was assassinated by Suleiman al-Halabi, a student at al-Azhar. Following the assassination, Napoleon ordered {{the closing of the}} mosque; the doors remained bolted until Ottoman and British assistance arrived in August 1801.|$|E

Although Montgomery had only lived in New York for two years and had not sought political involvement, he was well known and <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> the area and he felt obliged to attend. He was reluctant to go, but nonetheless went to New York City, 80 miles south of Rhinebeck.|$|E
5|$|Poe {{was also}} known as a writer of fiction and {{became one of the first}} American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States. Poe is {{particularly}} <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> France, in part due to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|Bugle rank {{consists}} of the Band Commander and eleven other senior cadets who are well <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> the band and have impeccable marching abilities. Each bugle rank member carries a bugle with a banner, but are never played during a performance. Together, the drum majors and bugle rank lead the band through the maneuvers on the field. In addition to their primary functions within the band, the bugles and maces also serve a military ceremonial function and are used to salute commissioned officers, much as a rifleman would salute with a rifle or a commander would salute with a sabre.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the notion of <b>respect</b> <b>in</b> the college classroom. While pedagogical researchers had previously studied the phenomenon, each found challenges in defining it. Moreover, communication scholars do not examine respect as a primary pedagogical factor with learning implications. Focus groups provided venues for topic-specific discussion necessary for better understanding the diversity of students' worldviews regarding <b>respect</b> <b>in</b> the college classroom. Grounded theory allowed for searching theoretical relevance of the phenomenon through constant comparison with categorical identification. The most practical contributions of this research identifies as several major notions including, the importance of relationships within the process, student self-esteem, and global-classroom <b>respect.</b> <b>In</b> addition, implications emerged from the data as learning, motivation, and environment. One other practical contribution exists as a respect communication model for the college classroom. Further, examining students' worldviews of <b>respect</b> <b>in</b> the classroom provides benefits for pedagogical scholars, students, and instructors...|$|R

5|$|During the 1640s and 1650s, Velázquez {{served as}} both court painter and curator of PhilipIV's {{expanding}} collection of European art. He {{seems to have}} been given an unusual degree of freedom in the role. He supervised the decoration and interior design of the rooms holding the most valued paintings, adding mirrors, statues and tapestries. He was also responsible for the sourcing, attribution, hanging and inventory of many of the Spanish king's paintings. By the early 1650s, Velázquez was widely <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> Spain as a connoisseur. Much of the collection of the Prado today—including works by Titian, Raphael, and Rubens—were acquired and assembled under Velázquez's curatorship.|$|E
5|$|The Hanoverian {{succession}} to {{the throne}} of Great Britain led to reigns with less ceremony than in any since the incorporation of the heralds. The only notable incident for the college in this period, {{during the reign of}} George I, happened in 1727 when an impostor called Robert Harman pretended to be a herald. The knave was prosecuted by the College in the county of Suffolk, and was sentenced to be pilloried in several market towns on public market days and afterwards to be imprisoned and pay a fine. This hefty sentence was executed, proving that the rights of the College were still <b>respected.</b> <b>In</b> 1737, during the reign of George II the College petitioned for another charter, to reaffirm their rights and remuneration; this effort proved unsuccessful. Apart from these events the influence of the College was greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|The coyote is a {{prominent}} character in Native American folklore, {{mainly in the}} Southwestern United States and Mexico, usually depicted as a trickster that alternately assumes {{the form of an}} actual coyote or a man. As with other trickster figures, the coyote uses deception and humor to rebel against social conventions. The animal was especially <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> Mesoamerican cosmology as a symbol of military might. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was reviled in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike wolves (gray, eastern, or red), which have undergone an improvement of their public image, attitudes towards the coyote remain largely negative.|$|E

5|$|The {{gray wolf}} {{is one of}} the world's best-known and most-researched animals, with {{probably}} more books written about it than any other wildlife species. It {{has a long history of}} association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. Although the fear of wolves is pervasive in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is rare, as wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans from hunters and shepherds.|$|E
5|$|Though widely <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> {{her later}} years, Roosevelt was a {{controversial}} First Lady {{at the time}} for her outspokenness, particularly her stance on racial issues. She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show, and speak at a national party convention. On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies. She launched an experimental community at Arthurdale, West Virginia, {{for the families of}} unemployed miners, later widely regarded as a failure. She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, the civil rights of African Americans and Asian Americans, and the rights of World War II refugees.|$|E
5|$|Van Alen was <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> {{his field}} {{for his work}} at the Albemarle {{building}} at Broadway and 24th Street, designed in collaboration with his partner H. Craig Severance. Van Alen and Severance complemented each other, with Van Alen being an original, imaginative architect and Severance being a shrewd businessperson who handled the firm's finances. However, the relationship between them became tense because of their disagreements on how best to run the firm. The breaking point came after a 1924 article in the Architectural Review that praised the building's design, giving attribution to Van Alen while ignoring Severance's role altogether; their association dissolved months later. This ended up being decisive for the design of the future Chrysler Building, since Severance had a more traditional architectural style and Van Alen had a more modern style.|$|E

5|$|When World WarII {{broke out}} in Europe, it was {{expected}} that the Japanese, who had already made aggressive moves against mainland China, would try to invade the Indies. In response, the Dutch colonial government– which had previously limited military training for native Indonesians– began teaching the populace how to deal with air raids. To co-ordinate the preparations, the Dutch formed Air Raid Preparation teams. Sudirman, <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> the community, was asked to lead the Cilacap chapter. Aside from teaching local citizens the safety procedures for dealing with an air raid, Sudirman established watchposts throughout the area. He and the Dutch would also have passing aircraft drop materials to simulate a bombing run; this was intended to improve response time.|$|E
5|$|As Boyce's {{interest}} in philanthropy grew, {{he turned to}} his childhood experiences in the outdoors as a resource, but could not find a way to channel his charitable ideas and dreams until a fateful stop to England while en route to what became the failed photographic expedition to Africa. Events in London on the way to and from this expedition would lead to the founding of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), one of many civic and professional organizations formed during the Progressive Era to fill the void of citizens who had become distended from their rural roots. Many youth organizations such as the Woodcraft Indians and Sons of Daniel Boone formed in America in the early 1900s focusing on outdoor character-building activities. The writings and adventures of Theodore Roosevelt contributed to these movements, with their outdoor, nature, and pioneer themes. By the time of his 1922 expedition to Africa, Boyce was so well <b>respected</b> <b>in</b> Scouting that French Boy Scouts in Algeria saluted him and offered to escort him along a trail when they found out he was the founder of BSA and LSA in America.|$|E
5|$|Gilligan played cricket for Dulwich College {{before the}} First World War, then for Cambridge, twice winning his blue. He briefly played county cricket for Surrey but moved to Sussex in 1920. Following {{a slow start}} to his county career, he rapidly {{improved}} and in partnership with Maurice Tate established a formidable bowling reputation. First playing for England in 1922, he was appointed Test captain in 1924. In the latter year, Gilligan was {{at the height of}} his form when he suffered a blow to his heart while batting. The strain affected his bowling, which was never again as effective, but he still captained England in Australia during the 1924–25 season. The series was lost, but both he and his team were popular and <b>respected.</b> <b>In</b> following years, he played less frequently; he resigned as Sussex captain in 1929 and retired three years later. He subsequently became a writer, journalist and cricket commentator while maintaining his connections with Sussex.|$|E
