25|$|The {{existing}} Slovenian railways are out-of-date and can't {{compete with}} the motorway network. The maintenance and modernisation of the Slovenian railway network has been neglected {{due to the lack}} of financial assets. Due to the out-of-date infrastructure, the share of the <b>railway</b> <b>freight</b> transport has been in decline in Slovenia. The railway passenger transport has been recovering after a large drop in the 1990s. The Pan-European railway corridors V and X, and several other major European rail lines intersect in Slovenia. All international transit trains in Slovenia drive through the Ljubljana Railway Hub.|$|E
25|$|Sydney's first tram was horse-drawn, {{running from}} the old Sydney Railway station to Circular Quay along Pitt Street. Built in 1861, the design was {{compromised}} {{by the desire to}} haul <b>railway</b> <b>freight</b> wagons along the line to supply city businesses, in addition to passenger traffic. This resulted in a track that protruded from the road surface and damaged the wheels of wagons trying to cross it. Hard campaigning by competing omnibus owners – as well as the fatal accident involving the leading Australian musician Isaac Nathan in 1864 – led to closure in 1866.|$|E
25|$|Miami-Dade County {{is located}} at the {{southern}} end of two prominent rail lines, the state-owned CSX passenger and freight line, and the Florida East Coast <b>Railway</b> <b>freight</b> line. It has a regional commuter rail system (Tri-Rail), which uses the CSX line along with Amtrak. South Florida was planned to be connected to Orlando and Tampa by the government funded Florida high speed rail system; however that plan was cancelled in 2011. In 2014, companies of the Florida East Coast Railway began construction on a higher-speed rail system to ultimately connect Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, and Orlando International Airport. Historically, the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) line extended all the way to Key West, running passenger and freight service on the famed Overseas Railroad through the Keys. However, this line was severely damaged during the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and service never returned.|$|E

25|$|More {{controversial}} {{than the}} role of technology is the argument over {{the role of}} politics in the origins of the region's decline. Confederation and the tariff and <b>railway</b> <b>freight</b> policies that followed have often been blamed for having a deleterious effect on the Maritime economies. Arguments have been made that the Maritimes' poverty was caused by control over policy by Central Canada which used the national structures for its own enrichment. This was the central view of the Maritime Rights Movement of the 1920s, which advocated greater local control over the region's finances. T.W. Acheson {{is one of the main}} proponents of this theory. He notes the growth that was occurring during the early years of the National Policy in Nova Scotia demonstrates how the effects of railway fares and the tariff structure helped undermine this growth. Capitalists from Central Canada purchased the factories and industries of the Maritimes from their bankrupt local owners and proceeded to close down many of them, consolidating the industry in Central Canada.|$|E
2500|$|Including {{the mining}} railways, in 2011–12, there were 290.6 billion tonne {{kilometres}} of freight moved by rail. [...] Overall <b>railway</b> <b>freight</b> in Australia {{is dominated by}} bulk freight, primarily iron ore and coal. In 2012–13 Australian railways carried over 1 billion tonnes of freight, 97 per cent of which were bulk movements. Intrastate bulk freight in Western Australia—principally iron-ore movements—accounted for 56 per cent of national rail freight tonnes. Bulk movements in Queensland and NSW—principally coal—were 22 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Although Calhoun {{was near}} a <b>railway,</b> <b>freight</b> charges {{were too high}} for small farmers. Calhoun had been {{isolated}} by poor dirt roads that turned to slick clay in rain.

It was surmised that the accident was a result of the crew of the freight train becoming incapacitated, and the resulting investigations revealed serious flaws in CN's employee practices.|$|E

2500|$|The graph {{compares the}} freight traffic (in ton-km) of the USSR to the US. The USSR rebuilt its rail system and industrialized with five-year plans. [...] As a result, <b>railway</b> <b>freight</b> grew about 20 times from 20 to 400 billion tonne-km by 1941. But then {{disaster}} struck again: World War II in 1941 when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. [...] In {{the first year}} {{or so of the}} war, traffic plummeted to about half its prewar value. [...] But then the USSR started restoring and constructing railways during wartime so {{that by the end of}} the war about half of the lost traffic had been recovered. [...] After the war was over it took a few more years to restore the railways and get back to the pre-war level of traffic.|$|E
2500|$|Then the USSR {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} more five-year plans and rail traffic rapidly increased. [...] By 1954 their rail freight traffic (about 850 billion tonne-km) surpassed that of the United States and the USSR then hauled more rail freight than {{any other country in the}} world. [...] Rail freight continued to rapidly increase in the USSR so that by 1960 the USSR was hauling about half of all <b>railway</b> <b>freight</b> in the world (in tonne-km) and they did this on a rail system consisting of 10% of the world's railway kilometrage. The status of hauling half the world's rail freight continued for almost 30 years but in 1988 rail freight traffic peaked at 3852 billion tonne-km (nearly 4 trillion). This rapid growth may seem impressive, but it was in part a failure because rail traffic at times didn't grow fast enough to satisfy demand, partly due to congestion.|$|E
2500|$|Tri-Rail may {{relocate}} or add {{service to}} a more easterly alignment on the Florida East Coast <b>Railway</b> <b>freight</b> line in a project known as the [...] "Coastal Link." [...] This would bring it closer to the major population centers of South Florida, of which the FEC line passes through about 22. This would also bring it directly into Downtown Miami, where it would terminate near the Government Center transit hub, and might possibly even have a spur to the Port of Miami. This would also extend service northward to Jupiter, which would more than double Tri-Rail's current system length. Currently, Tri-Rail is a phenomenal financial loss and relies heavily on shuttle buses and parking at stations {{because they are not}} within many people's walking distance. To save money, the state is looking to bid out Tri-Rail operations to a private organization such as the Florida Department of Transportation, which would likely own and operate the trains running on the FEC line. Other private companies may operate trains on the current line if the entire system is privatized, and an east–west connection could be made between the two, giving South Florida a more complete commuter rail system. The MIA station at the southern terminus of the current line will be closed for about two years from 2011 to 2013 while work is underway on the new Miami Central Station.|$|E

40|$|Express freight {{transportation}} {{is a rich}} seam of profit for China railway, and <b>railway</b> express <b>freight</b> system is a complex system with multiple variables and nonlinear feedback loops. This paper presents a System Dynamic Model for simulating the interaction between demand and supply of <b>railway</b> express <b>freight</b> system in China. The model consists of three submodels including economic environment, demand, supply, and investment, and its validity is verified by running in Vensim DDS software using historical data. In the simulation of period 2000 – 2025, the three variables are taken as control variables including growth rate of the national economy, <b>railway</b> express <b>freight</b> rate, and investment in fixed railway assets. Three scenarios for each control variable are simulated, and their effects are analyzed to provide beneficial reference for regulating the demand-supply gap of <b>railway</b> express <b>freight.</b> The simulation demonstrated that raising freight rate, adding investment in fixed railway assets, and decelerating economic growth rate are all effective ways to shrink the demand-supply gap of <b>railway</b> express <b>freight.</b> The model {{can be used to}} forecast the transport demand of <b>railway</b> express <b>freight</b> and test the outcomes of demand-supply regulating measures...|$|R
