25|$|Although {{research}} {{continued at}} the SCL in the passive detection of infrared emitted from heated aircraft engines, Blair {{became convinced that}} practical detection systems would involve reflected radio signals. He was certainly influenced in this by his earlier doctoral research in this field, and {{he was aware of}} the work on <b>radio</b> <b>detection</b> at the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, D.C. In December 1930, representatives of the SCL had been briefed at the NRL on the beat-interference phenomena that they were investigating, and in 1932, an NRL report on radio interference for target-detection was passed on to the Army. It does not appear, however, that any of this information was used by Blair.|$|E
2500|$|Radar was {{developed}} secretly for military use by several {{nations in the}} period before and during World War II. [...] A key development was the cavity magnetron in the UK, which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution. The term RADAR was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for <b>RAdio</b> <b>Detection</b> And Ranging or RAdio Direction And Ranging. [...] The term radar has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization.|$|E
2500|$|The {{search for}} a {{supernova}} remnant was negative until 1952, when Hanbury Brown and Cyril Hazard reported a <b>radio</b> <b>detection</b> at 158.5MHz, obtained at the Jodrell Bank Observatory. [...] This was confirmed, and its position more accurately measured, by Baldwin and Edge (1957) using the Cambridge Radio Telescope working at a wavelength of 1.9 m, and the remnant was also identified tentatively in the second Cambridge radio-source catalogue as object [...] "2C 34," [...] and identified more firmly as [...] "3C 10" [...] in the third Cambridge list (Edge et al. 1959). There is no dispute that 3C 10 is the remnant of the supernova observed in 1572–1573. Following a review article by Minkowski (1964), the designation 3C 10 appears to be that most commonly used in the literature when referring to the radio remnant of B Cas (though some authors use the tabulated Galactic designation G120.7+2.1 of Green 1984, and many authors commonly {{refer to it as}} [...] "Tycho's supernova remnant"). Because the radio remnant was reported before the optical supernova-remnant wisps were discovered, the designation 3C 10 is used by some to signify the remnant at all wavelengths.|$|E

40|$|We present deep 1. 4 GHz Very Large Array (VLA) radio {{continuum}} {{observations of}} two ~half square degree {{fields in the}} Coma cluster of galaxies. The two fields, "Coma 1 " and "Coma 3," correspond to the cluster core and southwest infall region and were selected on account of abundant pre-existing multiwavelength data. In their most sensitive regions the radio data reach 22 uJy rms per 4. 4 " beam, sufficient to detect (at 5 -sigma) Coma member galaxies with log(L) = 20. 11 W/Hz. The full catalog of <b>radio</b> <b>detections</b> is presented herein and consists of 1030 sources detected at >= 5 sigma, 628 of which are within the combined Coma 1 and Coma 3 area. We also provide optical identifications of the radio sources {{using data from the}} Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The depth of the radio observations allows us to detect AGN in cluster elliptical galaxies with Mr < - 20. 5 (AB magnitudes), including <b>radio</b> <b>detections</b> for all cluster ellipticals with Mr < - 21. 8.

40|$|Comparison of the VLA FIRST survey {{with various}} catalogs of bright stars allows an {{examination}} of the prevalence of stellar radio emission independent of optical selection criteria. This FIRST unbiased survey for radio stars covers nearly 5000 deg 2 of the northern sky to a flux density limit of 0. 7 mJy at 20 cm. Using astrometric catalogs which include proper motion information, we have detected 26 stellar radio sources, doubling the number of such objects previously known in this region of high-latitude sky. We also show that, in the absence of good proper motions, even the 100 precision of the FIRST positions is insucient to avoid crippling chance coincidence rates. We calculate the fraction of <b>radio</b> <b>detections</b> as a function of stellar magnitude, and show that, when proper motions from the Guide Star Catalog-II become available, the number of stellar <b>radio</b> source <b>detections</b> should increase fourfold.

2500|$|On {{the night}} of 2 January 1942, Moulin parachuted into France from a British plane with orders from de Gaulle to unify the {{resistance}} and {{to have all of}} the resistance accept his authority. On 27 March 1942, the first French Jews were rounded up by the French authorities, sent to the camp at Drancy, from where they were sent to Auschwitz to be killed. In April 1942, the PCF created an armed wing of its Main d'Oeuvre Immigée representing immigrants called the FTP-MOI under the leadership of [...] On 1 May 1942, May Day, which Vichy France had tried to turn into a Catholic holiday celebrating St. Philip, Premier Pierre Laval was forced to break off his speech when the crowd began to chant [...] "Mort à Laval". As millions of Frenchmen serving in the French Army had been taken prisoner by the Germans in 1940, there was a shortage of men in France during the Occupation, which explains why Frenchwomen played so a prominent role in the Resistance, with the résistante Germaine Tillon later writing: [...] "It was women who kick-started the Resistance." [...] In May 1942, speaking before a military court in Lyon, the résistante Marguerite Gonnet, when asked about why she had taken up arms against the Reich, replied: [...] "Quite simply, colonel, because the men had dropped them." [...] In 1942, the Royal Air Force (RAF) attempted to bomb the Schneider-Creusot works at Lyon, which was one of France's largest arms factories. The RAF missed the factory and instead killed around 1,000 French civilians. Two Frenchmen serving in the SOE, Raymond Basset (codename Mary) and André Jarrot (codename Goujean), were parachuted in and were able to repeatedly sabotage the local power grid to sharply lower production at the Schneider-Creusot works. Freney, who had emerged as a leading résistant, recruited the engineer Henri Garnier living in Toulouse to teach French workers at factories producing weapons for the Wehrmacht how best to drastically shorten the lifespan of the Wehrmacht's weapons, usually by making deviations of a few millimetres; such acts of quiet sabotage were almost impossible to detect, which meant no French people would be shot in reprisal. To maintain contact with Britain, Resistance leaders would sometimes go directly to the United Kingdom by crossing the English Channel at night on a boat, making their way to Britain via Spain and Portugal, or taking a [...] "spy taxi", as the British Lysander aircraft were known in France, which landed on secret airfields at night. More commonly, contact with Britain was maintained via radio. The Germans had powerful <b>radio</b> <b>detection</b> stations based in Paris, Brittany, Augsburg, and Nürnberg that could and would trace an unauthorized radio broadcast to within ten miles of its location. Afterwards, the Germans would send a van with a <b>radio</b> <b>detection</b> equipment to find the radio operator. For this reason, radio operators in the Resistance were advised not to keep broadcasting from the same location for long. To maintain secrecy, radio operators encrypted their messages using polyalphabetic ciphers. Finally, radio operators had a security key which to begin their messages; if captured and forced to radio Britain under duress, the radio operator would not use the key, which tipped off London that they had been captured.|$|E

40|$|We have {{searched the}} Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters (FIRST) and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) 1. 4 GHz radio surveys for sources that are {{coincident}} with emission-line galaxy (ELG) candidates from the KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey (KISS). A total of 207 of the 2157 KISS ELGs (~ 10 %) {{in the first}} two H-alpha-selected survey lists were found to possess <b>radio</b> <b>detections</b> in FIRST and/or NVSS. Follow-up spectra exist for all of the <b>radio</b> <b>detections,</b> allowing us to determine the activity type (star-forming vs. AGN) for the entire sample. We explore the properties of the radio-detected KISS galaxies in order to gain a better insight into the nature of radio-emitting galaxies in the local universe (z < 0. 1). No dwarf galaxies were detected, despite the large numbers of low-luminosity galaxies present in KISS, suggesting that lower mass, lower luminosity objects do not possess strong galaxian-scale magnetic fields. Due to the selection technique used for KISS, our radio ELGs represent a quasi-volume-limited sample, which allows us to develop a clearer picture of the radio galaxy population at low redshift. Nearly 2 / 3 rds of the KISS radio galaxies are starburst/star-forming galaxies, which is {{in stark contrast to the}} results of flux-limited radio surveys that are dominated by AGNs and elliptical galaxies (i. e., classic radio galaxies). While there are many AGNs among the KISS radio galaxies, there are no objects with large radio powers in our local volume. We derive a radio luminosity function (RLF) for the KISS ELGs that agrees very well with previous RLFs that adequately sample the lower-luminosity radio population.
