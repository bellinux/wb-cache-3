5|$|General <b>relativity</b> (GR) is {{a theory}} of {{gravitation}} that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general <b>relativity,</b> the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping {{of space and time}} by those masses.

It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.|$|E
5|$|General <b>relativity</b> can be {{understood}} by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics.

We derive the analytical formulae for the optimal linear <b>relativities</b> subject to a financial balanced inequality constraint.

40|$|When a bonus–malus {{system with}} a single set of optimal <b>relativities</b> {{and a set of}} simple {{transition}} rules is implemented, two inadequacy scenarios are induced because all policyholders are subject to the same a posteriori premium <b>relativities</b> (level transitions) independent of their a priori characteristics (current levels occupied). In this paper we propose a new objective function in the determination of optimal <b>relativities</b> that directly incorporates the a priori expected claim frequencies to partially address one of the inadequacy scenarios. We derive the analytical solution for the optimal <b>relativities</b> under a financial equilibrium constraint. Furthermore, we introduce a metric called effectiveness of transition rules to compare the different specifications of transition rules. We also argue that varying transition rules which are more flexible in addressing the other inadequacy scenario may be more effective than their corresponding simple rules. 9 page(s...|$|R

5|$|General <b>relativity</b> is the {{geometric}} theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 {{and the current}} description of gravitation in modern physics. It {{is the basis of}} current cosmological models of the Universe. General <b>relativity</b> generalizes special <b>relativity</b> and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime {{is directly related to the}} energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations. In general <b>relativity,</b> the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the acceleration of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of general <b>relativity</b> describe the evolution of the Universe over time.|$|E
