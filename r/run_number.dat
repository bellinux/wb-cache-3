5|$|On July 19, after a 21 at-bat hitless streak, Bonds hit 2 home runs, numbers 752 and 753, {{against the}} Chicago Cubs. He went 3–3 with 2 home runs, 6 RBIs, and {{a walk on}} that day. The {{struggling}} last place Giants still lost the game, 9–8. On July 27, Bonds hit home run 754 against Florida Marlins pitcher Rick VandenHurk. Bonds was then walked his next 4 at-bats in the game, but a 2-run shot helped the Giants win the game 12–10. It {{marked the first time}} since he had hit #747 that Bonds had homered in a game the Giants won. On August 4, Bonds hit a 382foot(116m) home run against Clay Hensley of the San Diego Padres for home <b>run</b> <b>number</b> 755, tying Hank Aaron's all-time record. Bonds greeted his son, Nikolai, with an extended bear hug after crossing home plate. Bonds greeted his teammates and then his wife, Liz Watson, and daughter Aisha Lynn behind the backstop. Hensley was the 445th different pitcher to give up a home run to Bonds. Ironically, given the cloud of suspicion that surrounded Bonds, the tying home run was hit off a pitcher who had been suspended by baseball in 2005 for steroid use. He was walked in his next at bat and eventually scored on a fielder's choice.|$|E

The <b>run</b> <b>number</b> display {{on the front of}} each train is made up of electronic green flip-dot display, as opposed to the manual plastic rollers of the Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 trains, while the rubber strips between the doors are thicker. The trains have a full white body and a thick red stripe in the middle. Similar to the Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 trains, the Siemens C651 trains have no visual passenger information systems, but have a built-in audio announcement system until the STARIS was installed and activated around 2010.|$|E

500|$|Fully {{recovered}} for the 1974 season, Killebrew {{made his}} mark early on, hitting two home runs in a May 5 match against the Detroit Tigers; the second was career home <b>run</b> <b>number</b> 550. In his honor, the Twins held a Harmon Killebrew Day in August, where {{it was announced that}} they would retire his number; Killebrew responded by leading the Twins to a 5–4 victory over the Orioles. He finished the season with a [...]222 batting average, 13 home runs, and 54 RBIs. In December 1974, he was given the option of staying with the Twins as a coach and batting instructor, managing the AAA Tacoma Twins, or being released. He chose to be released, ending his 21-season tenure with the Twins.|$|E
2500|$|Born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Foster {{was drafted}} by the San Francisco Giants {{in the third round}} of the 1968 Major League Baseball draft upon {{graduation}} from Leuzinger High School in Lawndale, California. After two seasons in their farm system, he debuted with the Giants at twenty years old in September [...] He went two-for-five with one run batted in as a pinch hitter and late inning defensive replacement. That year on September 22, Willie Mays pinch hit for Foster and scored his career home <b>run</b> <b>number</b> 600.|$|E
2500|$|Aaron (then age 39) hit 40 {{home runs}} in 392 at-bats, ending the 1973 season one home run short of the record. He hit home <b>run</b> <b>number</b> 713 on September 29, 1973, and with one day {{remaining}} in the season, many expected him to tie the record. But in his final game that year, playing against the Houston Astros (managed by Leo Durocher, who had once roomed with Babe Ruth), {{he was unable to}} achieve this. After the game, Aaron stated that his only fear was that he might not live to see the 1974 season.|$|E

30|$|Effect of {{different}} concentrations of pig manure were investigated {{at the same}} condition of NPK and Tween 80 (<b>run</b> <b>numbers</b> 6 and 8, and 10 and 12), and the findings demonstrated that the addition of pig manure can enhance the biodegradation process of SEO contaminant in soil. Yakubu[46], Agarry et al.[47], and Agarry and Owabor[71] in their respective work have demonstrated {{the positive effect of}} pig manure on enhanced biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. Abioye et al.[42] have also reported the positive effect of organic waste (brewery spent grain, spent mushroom compost, and banana skin) on enhanced biodegradation of used motor oil. Relatively, <b>run</b> <b>numbers</b> 3 and 4 and <b>run</b> <b>numbers</b> 7 and 8 had the same condition with different concentrations of NPK; the results show that extra addition of NPK fertilizer (nutrient) improved SEO biodegradation. A similar observation has been reported for SEO biodegradation[43] as well as for kerosene degradation[62].|$|R

2500|$|After repeating as AL Central champions in 2010, the Twins entered 2011 with no {{players on}} the {{disabled}} list, and the team seemed poised for another strong season. During the off-season, the team signed Japanese shortstop Tsuyoshi Nishioka to fill {{a hole in the}} middle infield, re-signed Jim Thome, who was in pursuit of career home <b>run</b> <b>number</b> 600, and also re-signed Carl Pavano. However, the season was largely derailed by an extensive list of injuries. Nishioka's broken leg in a collision at second base led the way and was followed by DL stints from Kevin Slowey, Joe Mauer, Jason Repko, Thome, Delmon Young (two stints on the DL), José Mijares, Glen Perkins, Joe Nathan, Francisco Liriano, Jason Kubel, Denard Span (two stints), Justin Morneau, Scott Baker, and Alexi Casilla. The team's low point was arguably on May 1 when the team started 7 players who were batting below [...]235 in a game against Kansas City. From that day forward, the Twins made a strong push to get as close as five games back of the division lead by the All-Star break. However, the team struggled down the stretch and fell back out of contention. The team failed to reach the playoffs {{for the first time since}} 2008 and experienced their first losing season in four years. Despite an AL-worst 63-99 record, the team drew over 3 million fans for the second consecutive year.|$|E
2500|$|The Braves {{returned}} to Atlanta, and on April 8, 1974, {{a crowd of}} 53,775 people showed up for the game—a Braves attendance record. The game was also broadcast nationally on NBC. In the fourth inning, Aaron hit home <b>run</b> <b>number</b> 715 off Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Al Downing. Although Dodgers outfielder Bill Buckner nearly went over the outfield wall trying to catch it, the ball landed in the Braves' bullpen, where relief pitcher Tom House caught it. While cannons were fired in celebration, two college students [...] sprinted onto the field and jogged alongside Aaron for part of his circuit around the bases, temporarily startling him. A very youthful Craig Sager actually interviewed Aaron between third and home for a television station, WXLT (now WWSB-Channel 40) in Sarasota. As the fans cheered wildly, Aaron's parents ran onto the field as well. Braves announcer Milo Hamilton, calling the game on WSB radio, described the scene as Aaron broke the record: [...] "Henry Aaron, {{in the second inning}} walked and scored. He's sittin' on 714. Here's the pitch by Downing. Swinging. There's a drive into left-center field. That ball is gonna be-eee... Outta here! It's gone! It's 715! There's a new home run champion of all time, and it's Henry Aaron! The fireworks are going. Henry Aaron is coming around third. His teammates are at home plate. And listen to this crowd!" [...] Meanwhile, Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully addressed the racial tension— or apparent lack thereof— in his call of the home run: [...] "What a marvelous moment for baseball; what a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia; what a marvelous moment for the country and the world. A black man is getting a standing ovation in the Deep South for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol. And it is a great moment for all of us, and particularly for Henry Aaron. ...And {{for the first time in}} a long time, that poker face in Aaron shows the tremendous strain and relief of what it must have been like to live with for the past several months." [...] On October 2, 1974, Aaron hit his 733rd and final home run as a Braves player. Thirty days later, after Aaron decided not to retire, the Braves traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers for Roger Alexander and Dave May. The trade re-united Aaron with former teammate Del Crandall, who was now managing the Brewers. On May 1, 1975, Aaron broke baseball's all-time RBI record, previously held by Ruth with 2,213. That year, he also played in his last and 24th All-Star Game (25th All-Star Game selection); he lined out to Dave Concepción as a pinch-hitter in the second inning. This All-Star Game, like the first one he played in 1955, was before a home crowd at Milwaukee County Stadium.|$|E
