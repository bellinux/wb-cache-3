40|$|Safety {{management}} and the long-term operation of complex socio-technical systems Ontario Hydro [...] {{one of the largest}} electrical utilities in North America [...] recently decided to shut down 7 of its 20 nuclear power plants at an estimated cost of $ 8 billion Canadian. The motivation for this unprecedented step was not technological problems, but rather inadequate management which led to a minimally acceptable level of safety (Andognini, 1997). This paper draws examples from a recent field study conduced at Pickering NGS (Vicente, 1997) to show how system safety can decline if not scrupulously managed. These plant closures emphasize the variable nature of system safety. System safety cannot be quantified and assessed {{at the beginning of a}} system’s operation and expected to remain constant after years of operation. Many elements of a complex socio-technical system evolve with time, interacting to affect safety in unknown ways. Changes in instrumentation, number and qualifications of operators, operating conditions, and organizational structure can undermine safety. Expecting that safety remains constant may dangerously underestimate <b>risk.</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>management</b> Safety management involves continuous monitoring and intervention to maintain safety as the system evolves. A critical element of this process is monitoring system safety, which requires a reliable means of assessing the level of safety and identifying potential safety problems. This paper focuses on the requirements of monitoring system safety. In particular, this paper describes two complementary approaches that combine to provide an accurate measure of system safety: incident analysis and safety assessments. Control theory provides a useful framework to examine safety management (Kjellen, 1987; HESSD ’ 98 18 Safety goa...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} focuses {{attention on}} safety challenges within the Norwegian shipping industry. A status {{picture of the}} shipboard safety culture and the interrelationships with safety management and organizational factors is given. Three research questions are explored: (1) What characterizes safety culture and safety management within the shipping industry? (2) What {{is the relationship between}} safety culture and safety performance within the shipping industry? (3) What characterizes shipping companies’ application of the safety management concept? In order to explore these research questions, four aims were defined to guide this work: (1) to outline and discuss the application of safety culture and safety management within merchant shipping; (2) to outline and discuss relevant theories of safety culture and safety management and analyze the relationship between safety culture and safety management; (3) to support the use of a methodological framework for the assessment of safety culture in relation to safety management; and (4) to assess safety culture within merchant shipping and analyze the relationship with safety management and actual performance. The research questions are further examined and specified in six journal articles. The thesis is divided into two main parts. Part I includes the overall framework in relation to research aims. Part II presents the six journal articles. In part I, chapter 1, a general introduction and a status picture of <b>risk,</b> <b>safety</b> <b>management,</b> and safety culture within the shipping industry are presented, which gives reason for the research aims and questions introduced in the chapter. Chapter 2 outlines the safety responsibilities within the industry at the international, national, and company levels. Emphasis is placed on the vi International Safety Management (ISM) Code, which provides the minimum standards and guidelines for operational safety management. Chapter 3 provides theoretical clarification and framing with regard to safety culture and safety management. This chapter also introduces a general working model used in the studies of safety culture and safety management in this thesis. Chapter 4 presents the methodological approach. The thesis builds upon a mixed method approach where both qualitative and quantitative techniques are used. The main results are briefly summarized in Chapter 5, followed by a discussion in Chapter 6 and concluding remarks in Chapter 7. The concluding remarks concern study limitations, implications, and suggestions for future research. The thesis draws upon theory from both the socio-anthropological and organizational psychological directions. In accordance with the organizational psychological perspective, a survey was carried out. A safety culture questionnaire developed by Studio Apertura, a constituent centre of The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), in collaboration with the Norwegian DNV and the research institution SINTEF was used. In total, 1, 574 questionnaires were distributed to 83 tanker and bulk/dry cargo carriers, with 1, 262 being returned from 76 of the vessels. The vessels were initially randomly selected from the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association member list, but as participation was voluntary, some withdrawal occurred. Statistical analysis involves descriptive statistics, factor analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation modeling. The statistical survey results were complemented by qualitative data obtained through document studies, case studies including two tanker companies and two bulk/dry cargo companies, vii interviews, participating observations and field studies at sea, and participation in other maritime forums. The study results indicate several deficiencies in all parts of a traditional safety management system defined as: (1) the reporting and collection of experience data from the vessel; (2) data processing, summarizing, and analysis; (3) the development of safety measures; and (4) implementation. The underreporting of experience data is found to be a problem, resulting in limitations related to the data-processing process. Regarding the development of safety measures, it is found that the industry emphasizes the development of standardized safety measures in the form of procedures and checklists. Organizational root causes related to company policies (e. g., crewing policy) is to a lesser degree identified and addressed. The most prominently identified organizational influential factors are the shipping companies crewing policy, which includes rotation systems, crew stability, and contract conditions, and shipboard management. The companies’ orientation toward local management, which includes leadership training, educational, and other managerial support, are also essential. The shore part of the organization is identified as the driving force for development and change in the shipboard safety culture.

A successful <b>Safety</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>Management</b> System (SRMS) can reduce accident rates and protect construction company's physical, organizational and human capitals, hence bring benefit to the project and the company. However, unlike investment in IT or real estate projects which will benefit the firm by selling products such as software and properties, the benefits of inputting money and human resources into <b>safety</b> <b>management</b> cannot be measured easily in tangible and physical terms. In addition, the prior expenses on accident risk prevention measures and approaches always seem very expensive, hence <b>safety</b> <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> system has been considered as a non-returnable investment that is not of benefit to anyone. This misunderstanding widely exists among construction contractors and clients.

Manual risk identification requires laborious efforts in collecting and analyzing data for different process safety elements. Ontology provides intelligent integration of affected elements. Each element is represented by an ontology that provides future application with knowledge of process safety. In a distributed environment, each ontology can be represented by agent that exchanged the information to fulfill the requirement of the analysis. Index Terms—ontology, process <b>safety</b> <b>management,</b> hazard identification...|$|R

A {{case study}} of peach growers in California shows that cultivar diversity reduces both yield and revenue variability. As a result, the probability of falling below minimum income requirements set using a safety-first model is reduced using this strategy. cultivar, diversification, peaches, <b>risk</b> <b>management,</b> <b>safety</b> first, <b>Risk</b> and Uncertainty,...|$|R
