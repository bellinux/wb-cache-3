5|$|In Heian-era Japan, {{husbands and}} wives kept {{separate}} households; children were <b>raised</b> <b>with</b> their mothers, although the patrilineal system was still followed. Murasaki was unconventional because she lived in her father's household, most likely on Teramachi Street in Kyoto, with her younger brother Nobunori. Their mother died, perhaps in childbirth, when the children were quite young. Murasaki had at least three half-siblings <b>raised</b> <b>with</b> their mothers; she {{was very close to}} one sister who died in her twenties.|$|E

Hitler rejected both of these proposals.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{the dynamic}} {{characteristics}} for three {{different kinds of}} copper tailings are studied {{through a series of}} cyclic triaxial tests. It is found that under confining pressure 200 and 300 kPa, elastic modulus <b>raises</b> <b>with</b> the increasement of coarse grain content to a certain degree and then declines, and the maximum elastic modulus corresponds to good gradation. While, as for confining pressure 100 kPa, elastic modulus <b>raises</b> <b>with</b> the increasement of fine grain content. It is also found that elastic modulus <b>raises</b> <b>with</b> the increasement of confning pressure. And, damping ratio <b>raises</b> <b>with</b> the increasement of shear strain and finally to a stable value. Finally, the fitting Gd/Gdmax～γ curve for three kinds of tailings shows the reasonableness of test results...|$|R

5|$|The Ombla {{is used as}} {{a source}} of {{drinking}} water for Dubrovnik's water supply network, and construction of a hydroelectric power plant has been planned for the past two decades. , the plans entail construction of a subsurface reservoir and a 68megawatt power plant. The plan sparked controversy amid doubts <b>raised</b> <b>with</b> respect to environmental protection and biodiversity management, technical and financial feasibility, and procedural problems related to the project. A particular concern expressed was that the underground reservoir might trigger earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the park was originally waterlogged marshland and a lake covered the area {{of what is now}} the Museum Gardens. The land was drained in the early 19th century and the Museum Gardens were <b>raised</b> <b>with</b> silt dredged from Minster Pool. The large northern area of the park once formed the land and gardens of Beacon House. This land was incorporated into the park when the owner of Beacon House, Colonel Swinfen Broun, donated the land after his death.|$|E

Two more Bloodhound squadrons followed; No. 112 Squadron RAF, which was reformed at RAF Church Fenton on 1 August 1960, and No. 247 Squadron RAF which was formed at RAF Carnaby on 1 July 1960.|$|E
5|$|According to Stratton and Martin, {{movement}} is the game's most important pillar. To help keep movement fast, weapon reloading was excluded and levels {{were designed to}} discourage players from hiding. On January 25, Stratton confirmed the game's feature of non-linear exploration and stated that combat is the game's focus and that {{the difficulty of the}} game was <b>raised</b> <b>with</b> the aim of creating an ultimate first-person shooter. On March 31, 2016, the release date of the Doom beta, a cinematic trailer directed by Joe Kosinski was created to evoke the game's three core pillars: incessant combat, terrifying demons, and powerful guns.|$|E
5|$|All of BA's Concorde fleet {{have been}} grounded, drained of {{hydraulic}} fluid and their airworthiness certificates withdrawn. Jock Lowe, ex-chief Concorde pilot {{and manager of}} the fleet estimated in 2004 that it would cost £10–15million to make G-BOAF airworthy again. BA maintain ownership and have stated {{that they will not}} fly again {{due to a lack of}} support from Airbus. On 1 December 2003, Bonhams held an auction of British Airways Concorde artefacts, including a nose cone, at Kensington Olympia in London. Proceeds of around £750,000 were <b>raised,</b> <b>with</b> the majority going to charity. G-BOAD is currently on display at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. In 2007, BA announced that the advertising spot at Heathrow where a 40% scale model of Concorde was located would not be retained; the model is now on display at the Brooklands Museum, in Surrey, England.|$|E

She was a multi-sport athlete growing up and began playing soccer at an early age. However, she did not begin playing club soccer until age 14 when she joined Cypress Elite. With the club team, she won the Coast Soccer League (CSL) under-16 championship and placed third at the under-19 level.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} fitted with three {{temporary}} masts for their delivery voyages, although only Cerberus had her freeboard <b>raised</b> <b>with</b> {{the addition of}} temporary bulwarks. The ships spent {{the bulk of their}} service lives in reserve and rarely, if ever, left their home port. Magdala was sold in January 1903, but Cerberus was hulked in 1900 and transferred to the Royal Australian Navy when it was formed in 1911. She was renamed HMAS Platypus II in 1918 and sold in 1924. Stripped of all salvageable material, she was scuttled in 1926 as a breakwater, and her remains are still visible today.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the main game, after certain quests are completed Legend of Mana gives the player the option to delve into optional gameplay aspects centered around the hero or heroine's house. The player can forge or improve weapons and armor using raw materials found throughout the game, or combine equipment with items to change their power or add special effects. They can grow different types of fruit in the orchard, raise pets to use as adventuring companions, create items, and build golems.

The disputed site was split into two parts, each priced at £6,000. The western section would be purchased immediately using £6,000 of the £7,000 already <b>raised,</b> <b>with</b> an option to purchase the eastern section if the remaining £5,000 could be raised within two years, after which the CPF would go ahead with building plans if the money could not be raised.|$|E
5|$|Lynch, {{the fourth}} of six children, was born March 31, 1955, in the {{neighborhood}} of South Boston. He was <b>raised</b> <b>with</b> his five sisters in the Old Colony Housing Project. His father, Francis Lynch, was an ironworker who had dropped out of school in the eighth grade. His mother, Anne (née Havlin), was a night-shift post office worker. Both parents came from fourth-generation South Boston families. He attended St. Augustine Elementary School and South Boston High School. During high school vacations he began working in construction alongside his father. After graduating from high school in 1973, Lynch became an apprentice ironworker. For the next six years he worked on high-altitude structural ironwork throughout the United States for various companies, including General Motors and U.S. Steel.|$|E

A fourth company was created in December 1814, and further recruitment was begun along the Georgia coast {{during the first quarter}} of 1815.

5|$|Pedro II's {{mother died}} when he was one year old, and his father remarried, to Amélie of Leuchtenberg, a couple years later. Pedro II formed a strong bond with Empress Amélie, whom he {{considered}} to be his mother throughout the remainder of his life. When Pedro I abdicated on 7 April 1831 and departed to Europe with Amélie, Pedro II was left behind with his sisters and became the second emperor of Brazil. He was <b>raised</b> <b>with</b> simplicity but received an exceptional education towards shaping what Brazilians then considered an ideal ruler. The sudden and traumatic loss of his parents, coupled with a lonely and unhappy upbringing, greatly affected Pedro II and shaped his character.|$|E
5|$|Speyer's two {{principal}} legacies {{are the three}} deep-level tube lines of the London Underground, and the Promenade Concerts. The former {{might not have been}} built without the finance he <b>raised</b> <b>with</b> Yerkes, and would have struggled without his chairmanship. The latter may have failed in the early 20th century without his financial support. The tube lines now form the central sections of the Underground's Northern, Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines. After Speyer's funding of the Promenade Concerts ended, they were taken over by music publishers Chappell & Co. and, in 1927, by the BBC. The characters of Sir Hermann and Lady Aline Gurtner in E. F. Benson's 1919 novel Robin Linnet were based on Sir Edgar and Lady Speyer. Leanne Langley suggests that the character of Appleton, a villainous stockbroker, in John Buchan's The Thirty-Nine Steps may have been based on Speyer.|$|E
