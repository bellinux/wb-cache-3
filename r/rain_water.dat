5|$|The campus {{has its own}} sewage {{treatment}} plant, has made use of <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> harvesting and has a four-acre artificial lake.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{internal}} structure was completely changed, {{the city was}} carefully planned; first to be built were the streets that descended from the elevated center into the gates, ensuring the drainage of <b>rain</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mercury and cadmium are toxic and {{may cause}} {{environmental}} damage if they enter rivers or <b>rain</b> <b>water.</b> This {{may result in}} contaminated crops {{as well as the}} bioaccumulation of mercury in a food chain leading to an increase in illnesses caused by mercury and cadmium poisoning.|$|E
40|$|Concentratios of Cl-, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, and HCO 3 - ions {{were studied}} in <b>rain</b> <b>waters</b> and {{condensed}} atmospheric moisture above the Atlantic Ocean. Maximal {{number of samples}} was collected in the eastern tropical North Atlantic. Concentration of chloride ions ranged from 1 to 28 mg/l in <b>rain</b> <b>waters</b> (average 4. 3 mg/l) and ranged from 0. 3 to 2 mg/l in condensed atmospheric moisture with the average about one order of magnitude less than that for <b>rain</b> <b>waters.</b> Chloride normalized concentrations of magnesium and calcium are greater in <b>rain</b> <b>waters</b> and condensed atmospheric moisture than in ocean water due to more intensive subtraction of these ions as compared to chloride ions. Chloride normalized HCO 3 - concentration is one order of magnitude greater in atmospheric moisture than in seawater, possibly because of volatile component CO 2 taking part in exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} earned its nickname {{because when}} it <b>rains</b> <b>water</b> pours over the woman's {{face on the}} facade, running down her cheeks like tears.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel {{is subject}} to {{flooding}} during massive torrential <b>rains.</b> <b>Waters</b> rose to a height of 60 inches after a storm in July 2003.|$|R
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{reshape the}} geology near the coast by eroding sand {{from the beach}} as well as offshore, rearranging coral, and changing dune configuration onshore. Their <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> gets absorbed into stalagmites within caves, creating a record of past tropical cyclone impacts.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the main}} central shrine there are slab {{coverings}} which have perforations in them to drain rainwater {{to a large}} underground storage. The pipe lines from the roof lead the <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> to the storage are also visible. The temple needs conservation measures to preserve the ancient monument in good shape.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, {{concerns}} {{with the leadership}} of the Battleship Texas Commission led to the decision by the State Legislature to turn over control of the ship to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). The legislature abolished the commission effective 31 August 1983, and TPWD assumed operational control the next day. One of the first actions by TPWD was to hire a firm of naval architects to survey the ship in order to assess the deterioration and make recommendations as to what actions should be taken to preserve the ship. The survey revealed that the ship's watertight integrity was badly compromised, the hull was open to the sea in many places, and many compartments were full of standing <b>rain</b> <b>water.</b> The architects determined that the ship needed to go to dry dock for major repairs to the hull and to keep <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> from coming through the porous concrete deck. As part of this plan, serious consideration was given to protecting sensitive fabrics and restoring the interior of the ship. After a five-year-long fund-raising campaign, $15 million was collected to dry dock the ship and complete necessary repairs.|$|E
50|$|Salty {{springs from}} <b>rain</b> <b>waters</b> {{fall on the}} western part of the Gogol {{mountain}} range. There is one particular spring near the city, where people with various ailments come to drink for better health.|$|R
50|$|Mychig {{waterfall}} {{is located}} in Qabala District. It takes its source from snow and <b>rain</b> <b>waters</b> in Gotur mountain and falls into Demiraparan River. High about 96 m, Mychig waterfall is the highest waterfall in Azerbaijan.|$|R
50|$|On October 11, 2008 Le Chat {{received}} his own market place in Hotton in the Belgian province Luxembourg. A statue of him, sculpted by François Deboucq, {{was placed in}} the center, depicting him holding an umbrella which <b>rains</b> <b>water</b> down from inside.|$|R
5|$|Cultivation {{requirements}} {{vary greatly}} by species. In general, though, sundews require high environmental moisture content, {{usually in the}} form of a constantly moist or wet soil substrate. Most species also require this water to be pure, as nutrients, salts, or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them. Commonly, plants are grown in a soil substrate containing some combination of dead or live sphagnum moss, sphagnum peat moss, sand, and/or perlite, and are watered with distilled, reverse osmosis, or <b>rain</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|Malvern {{water is}} a natural spring water from the Malvern Hills {{on the border of}} the {{counties}} of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in England. The Hills consist of very hard granite and limestone rock. Fissures in the rock retain <b>rain</b> <b>water,</b> which slowly permeates through, escaping at the springs. The springs release an average of about 60 litres a minute and the flow has never been known to cease.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of Brody Hall, a residence hall of Michigan State University Housing, {{was completed in}} August 2011 and qualified for LEED Silver certification because the facility includes a <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> collection tank used for restroom fixtures, a white PVC roof, meters that will monitor utilities {{to make sure they}} are used efficiently, and the use of recycled matter and local sources for building materials.|$|E
50|$|Murphy's Hole is {{situated}} {{at the north end}} of a depression that also contains Seltanacool Sinks. A waterfall drains into the sink, which takes a large volume of <b>water</b> in heavy <b>rains.</b> <b>Water</b> draining here has been dye traced to the resurgence at Carrickbeg.|$|R
50|$|According to the Mines and Energy Ministry of Paraguay, {{as well as}} the Environment Secretary, {{the entire}} area around the lake is area of reload of the Guaraní Aquifer, because the {{permeable}} soil allows filtering and feed the water reserve of this aquifer with the <b>rain</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|R
50|$|During heavy <b>rains,</b> <b>water</b> {{pools in}} a basin {{about the city}} and funnels through the gap and has {{resulted}} in devastating floods. The Templeton Gap Floodway was built in 1949 to divert waters and {{reduce the likelihood of}} flooding. The city operates a trail named Templeton Gap trail.|$|R
5|$|Surrounding the {{southern}} part of Lake Okeechobee is the Fort Thompson Formation, made of dense, hard limestone, shells, and sand. <b>Rain</b> <b>water</b> is less likely to erode the limestone to form solution holes—smaller versions of sinkholes that do not intersect with the water table. In this formation the beds are generally impermeable. Underneath the metropolitan areas of Palm Beach County is the Anastasia Formation, composed of shelly limestone, coquina, and sand representing a former mangrove or salt marsh. The Anastasia Formation is much more permeable and filled with pocks and solution holes. The Fort Thompson and Anastasia Formations, and Miami Limestone and (x), were formed during the Sangamon interglacial period.|$|E
5|$|The repairs mainly {{involved}} {{fixing holes}} in the roof and preventing the ingress of <b>rain</b> <b>water,</b> as well as repairing the weatherboards on the sides. The intervention by English Heritage led to a protracted dispute over the £30,000 cost of the repairs that was scheduled to come to trial at the High Court of Justice in April 2012. In January 2012, a settlement was reached in which Harmondsworth Barn Ltd sold the barn to English Heritage for £20,000. By that time the government had abandoned its plans to expand Heathrow Airport and the barn had become a liability for the company.|$|E
5|$|Trees are an {{important}} part of the terrestrial ecosystem, providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of <b>rain</b> <b>water,</b> help prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.|$|E
50|$|During {{the rainy}} season of 2009-2010, the region of Cusco {{received}} high levels of precipitation that are atypical, which caused permanent damage to the ruins of Moray. The terraced levels of the complex, which are constructed from stone and compacted earth, were damaged extensively as the excessive <b>rain</b> <b>waters</b> undermined the ground beneath the structure.|$|R
50|$|The {{bottom of}} the caves {{routinely}} floods during heavy <b>rains.</b> <b>Water</b> seeps in from the surface level and the cave acts as a drainage system which empties into the river below. The electrical wiring for {{this portion of the}} cave conforms to underwater standards to accommodate the flooding. Flooding shortens but does not eliminate tours.|$|R
5000|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "Labyrinth of Porsenna", {{a series}} of tunnels under the town, built in the 6th-5th century BC and probably utilized in Etruscan-Roman times for drainage of <b>rain</b> <b>waters.</b> According to Pliny the Elder (Naturalis historia, XXXVI, XIX, 91-93), the Labyrinth {{was part of a}} monument including the sepulchre of the King Porsenna.|$|R
5|$|Seung Sahn {{was born}} in 1927 as Duk-In Lee (modern romanisation: Yi Deog'in) in Sunchon (순천), South Pyongan Province of {{occupied}} Korea (now North Korea) to Presbyterian parents. In 1944, he joined an underground resistance movement {{in response to the}} ongoing occupation of Korea by the Empire of Japan. He was captured by Japanese police shortly after, avoided a death sentence, and spent time in prison. Upon his release, he studied Western philosophy at Dongguk University. One day, a monk friend of his lent him a copy of the Diamond Sutra. While reading the text, he became inspired to ordain as a monk and left school, receiving the prātimokṣa precepts in 1948. Seung Sahn then performed a one-hundred day solitary retreat in the mountains of Korea, living on a diet of pine needles and <b>rain</b> <b>water.</b> It is said he attained enlightenment on this retreat.|$|E
25|$|An impersonal example: Po vakarykštės audros daug prilijo → Po vakarykštės audros daug prilyta – There {{is a lot}} of <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> after yesterday’s storm – It {{has been}} a lot of <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> after yesterday’s storm.|$|E
25|$|While {{the role}} of <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> δD as the {{fundamental}} control on the final δD of lipids is well documented, the importance of fractionation effects from <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> to soil water and leaf water on εl/w is appreciated but remains poorly understood.|$|E
40|$|This paper studied {{analysis}} of the coloring substances in the <b>rain</b> storage <b>water.</b> We observed two kinds of coloring substances in the <b>rain</b> storage <b>water.</b> It was considered that one is originated from fallen leaves {{and is able to}} be removed easily using activated carbon. The other substances might be originated from dust in the snow...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a part of}} Kaveri river {{passes the}} water to the village, people store the <b>rain</b> <b>waters</b> in lakes and ponds, which is helpful during the summer. People use the {{borewell}} water for irrigation and drinking. Agriculture is carried out in vast areas around this place. Rice, sugar cane, peanuts,sunflower and plantains are the major crops.|$|R
5000|$|The {{narrative}} further describes {{that when}} Ashoka heard of these miracles, he was overcome with curiosity {{and decided to}} enter the chamber to verify for himself the veracity of the stories. After arriving there he witnessed Samudra levitating with half his body on fire {{and the other half}} <b>raining</b> <b>water.</b> [...] Intrigued he asked Samudra to identify himself.|$|R
25|$|<b>Rain</b> <b>water</b> {{harvesting}} {{is practiced}} in campus. The campus has staff quarters and a play area {{to accommodate the}} faculty and their families.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> {{caused the}} sewage system to {{overflow}} and all water lines were contaminated. The Government ordered all housing societies to add chlorine to their water tanks while they decontaminated the water supply.|$|E
25|$|Only S.purpurea {{normally}} contains {{significant amounts}} of rainwater in its tubular pitchers. It is a myth that all species contain water. In fact, the hoods of the other species help to keep out <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> in addition to keeping flying prey from escaping.|$|E
50|$|Camel Valley: A few metres {{away from}} Bhatsa river Valley, {{on the right}} is the camel valley. On {{the other side of the}} valley is a {{waterfall}} formed by the <b>rain</b> <b>waters</b> and one have to walk over and look down to find a slop that falls over 1, 000 ft. The waterfall is the chief attraction of this place.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a system}} of {{wetlands}} (humedales) that regulate the soil moisture acting like sponges for the <b>rain</b> <b>waters.</b> Fifteen wetlands have a protected status, with various wetlands as unprotected. In 1950, the total surface area of the wetlands amounted to 150000 ha, but due to the urbanisation of the Colombian capital the total area {{has been reduced to}} 1500 ha.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{simultaneous}} determination of anions (sulfate, nitrate, and chloride) and cations (sodium, ammonium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium) in acid <b>rain</b> <b>waters</b> was investigated using high-performance ion-exclusion/cation-exchange chromatography with conductimetric detection on a separation column packed with a polymethacrylate-based weakly acidic cation-exchange resin in the hydrogen-form and an eluent comprising 1. 5 mM sulfosalicylic acid– 6 mM 18 -crown- 6 at pH 2. 6, operated at 1. 5 ml/min. Effective separation and highly sensitive conductimetric detection for the anions and the cations was achieved in about 14 min. Since the ionic balance (equivalents of anions/equivalents of cations) of acid <b>rain</b> <b>waters</b> of different pH (4. 40 – 4. 67) ranged from 0. 97 to 0. 94, {{evaluation of the}} water quality of acid rain was possible. This method was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of the anions and the cations in acid rain transported from mainland China and North Korea to central Japan monitored by a meteorological satellite data analyzer...|$|R
