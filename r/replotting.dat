50|$|This simple game mechanic, {{forced upon}} the {{designers}} by {{the limitations of}} the terminal and the central computer, paradoxically gave Empire a great deal of tactical depth by making it a limited-information game. For example, a player, seeing torps launched towards him, could wait without <b>replotting</b> until they were about to be hit, then change course towards the attacker, go to maximum speed, and hyperjump over the torps, then fire his own torps. Since the players could only have a limited number of torps active at any time, the original attacker would have to detonate his torps and launch new ones in order to respond. Of course, an experienced player, knowing that this was likely to happen, would likely have already detonated his first cluster of torps and launched a new set, hoping that his opponent would hyperjump right into them—except that the opponent, knowing this, would do something slightly different. The best players could get inside the heads of other players, figure out {{what they were going to}} do, influence them to do certain things, and destroy them.|$|E

We account for the results by a theoretical model in which the alcohols {{are assumed to be}} mechanically forced into the bubble at collapse, modifying the adiabatic exponent of the gas.

40|$|The {{incremental}} transfer effectiveness concept can {{be extended}} to a constrained maximiza-tion context by <b>replotting</b> the data to form a set of iso-transfer contours and adding COn-straints to this same graph as binding linear functions.

Alternatively, the dual problem of finding the minimum value of these constraints can be solved to achieve a specified transfer of training. An example of applying the Lagrange Multiplier method to training is provided and the potential usefulness of mathematical programming techniques noted. This extension is particularly useful in complex training environments involving numerous instructional technologies or frequently changing constraints.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of a spatial point pattern is often involved with looking for spatial structure, such as clustering or regularity in the points (or events). For example, it is of biological interest to characterize the pattern of tree locations in a forest. This has traditionally been done using global summaries, such as the K-function or its differential, the product density function. In this article, we define a local version of the product density function for each event, derived under a definition of a local indicator of spatial association (LISA). These product density LISA functions can then be grouped into bundles of similar functions using multivariate hierarchical clustering techniques. The bundles can then be visualized by a <b>replotting</b> of the data, obtained via classical multidimensional scaling of the statistical distances between functions. Thus, we propose {{a different way of}} looking for structure based on how an event relates to nearby events.

40|$|A {{software}} package {{has been developed}} and implemented on a BBC microcomputer system which allows borehole data to be entered into disc files and full borehole logs, including both graphical and textual components, to be prepared automati-cally from the stored data. The operator can select the required format and scale from a menu of standard options or can set up any required special layout. Any required scale can be selected and log headings may be printed in either the English or French language. Once a set of data has been entered into a disc file, the information can be <b>replotted</b> at will to any required format and scale. Thus, after having prepared a detailed log at say 1 : 50 scale, the same data can be <b>replotted</b> as a summary log at, for example, 1 : 200 for direct inclusion in an interpretative drawing and as a simplified log at 1 : 100 scale.

40|$|Cemeteries are microcosms {{of society}} bound {{together}} in sacred spaces. As manifestations of social mores, cemeteries allow anthropologists {{to obtain information}} on social development and structure. Where noninvasive study is mandated, crucial methods of interpretation include studies of landscape design, floral incorporation, grave marker design and development, and grave mementos. This thesis discusses these and other methods as {{they are used to}} infer group mores. It also indicates how information acquired from methods can be adversely affected by outside influences, such as vandalism, weathering, and <b>replotting.</b> This thesis adds to known methods of cemetery research another unbiased, noninvasive tool that is the analyses of public cemetery sales records of a known society 2 ̆ 7 s municipal cemetery, Greenwood Cemetery of Orlando, Florida. Greenwood Cemetery opened at approximately {{the same time as the}} founding of its host city, Orlando, Florida. All burial and plot ownership, regardless of the social status of the owner, are publicly accessible in accordance with the requirements of the Florida Sunshine law. As the city and the cemetery followed parallel development, socioeconomic trends affected the city and the cemetery in a similar manner. Using public records dating from 1890 to 2010, a random survey was conducted that acquired sale dates, death dates, prices, numbers of plots purchased, and types of plots purchased. Using SPSS, the acquired information was statistically analyzed for correlations to known historic moments such as The Great Depression and the Florida Land Boom. Comparisons of data revealed fluctuations in the time between purchase and death: a decreasing length of time, an increasing length of time, and a repeated decreasing of time. The survey of the prices of plots revealed a positive correlation over time, indicating uniformity. A strong shift from the purchase of full body plots to cremation plots over time was evident, which was interpreted as a reflection of a shift in religious and social mores. Additionally, the study showed a significant increase in the percentage of purchased plots used. An ANOVA reveals that <b>replotting</b> is not significant enough to affect interpretation of cultural mores manifested in landscape design and spatial usage. While the results lend themselves to more questions and study, the analyses of cemetery sale records demonstrates its vitality as an unbiased, noninvasive, publicly accessible instrument. The analyses of sales records will also enable cross cultural comparisons...|$|E
40|$|The {{comment by}} K. Hansen {{suggests}} that the time-of-flight mass spectrometry data in one table in our paper from 2103 in IJMS should {{be due to a}} proton contamination and correspond to protons p instead of deuterons D. The evidence for such a suggestion is a re-plotting of our data, giving a bond distance of 5. 0 pm instead of 2. 3 pm, corresponding to state s = 3 instead of s = 2 in the ultra-dense hydrogen. However, protium has indeed been studied on the next pages in our paper, giving shorter time-of-flights as expected. A <b>replotting</b> of our protium results as suggested by Hansen gives a best fit mass of 0. 6 u, showing that the suggested procedure gives consistently too small mass. Hansen also rejects the rotational energy transfer model as due to our use of D in the analysis of the data. However, this model has been applied successfully in two previous publications, including experiments using protium. Hansen also {{suggests that the}} protium is due to a contamination of the source; however, the gas feed (H 2 or D 2) and its result is well controlled and monitored. The most likely source of protons was instead laser-induced nuclear fusion, but the laser intensity in these experiments was a factor three too low to give strong fusion. Thus, the suggestion by Hansen is not valid. Comment: 2 figure...|$|E
