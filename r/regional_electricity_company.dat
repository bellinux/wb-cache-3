50|$|Powergen {{was formed}} in 1989 as a Public Limited Company which was wholly owned by the UK {{government}} and acquired about 50% of the Central Electricity Generating Board generating capacity. Sir Robert Malpas was Chairman of the Group from 1989 to 1991. Sixty per cent of Powergen was sold to private investors in 1991, followed by the remaining 40% in March 1995. It expanded considerably by acquiring the <b>regional</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>company</b> East Midlands Electricity in 1998 and the supply business of TXU Energi in 2002. Powergen was eventually taken over itself by E.ON, an acquisition which was completed in January 2002.|$|E
50|$|The first {{organisation}} to {{plan for}} a new power station on the site was Cumbria Power in 1987, formed of four engineers. They hoped to build a CCGT plant that used the steam turbines of the former plant. This idea wasn't feasible, so a new power station was chosen instead, but situated in the former turbine hall. ABB joined the planning process in April 1989, and a new company - Lakeland Power Ltd - was formed, being owned 80% by ABB and 20% by Cumbria Power. In October 1989, the North Western Electricity Board (NORWEB) {{signed an agreement with}} Lakeland Power to have a supply of electricity - the first such agreement between a UK <b>regional</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>company</b> and a private generator. NORWEB also bought 20% of the company.|$|E
50|$|Yorkshire in {{the past}} has been synonymous with coal mining. Many pits closed in the 1990s, with the last two that were open in the Pontefract area at Kellingley (closed on 18 December 2015) and Sharlston. In South Yorkshire, there was Maltby Main Colliery and Hatfield Colliery (closed in June 2015) at Stainforth. The NUM was very Yorkshire-dominated. Coal still plays a part in the economy - there are two large power {{stations}} along the Aire Valley, with Drax being the second largest in Europe with 3,945 MW of capacity, and Eggborough which is owned by the Czech Republic's Energetický a průmyslový holding (EPH) since 2014 and was owned by British Energy until 2010; Ferrybridge C closed on 23 March 2016. The distribution area once looked after by the <b>regional</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>company</b> Yorkshire Electricity is now looked after by Northern Powergrid (former YEDL), owned by Berkshire Hathaway (since 2001) of Omaha, Nebraska. The supply side of the region is now owned by npower (former National Power, now owned by RWE of Essen, Germany). 29% of the UK's oil is refined on the Humber.|$|E

The work provides a study into the competitive electricity market or non-franchise electricity supply market in England and Wales. Up until April 1990 all electricity customers bad no choice in their electricity supplier. Customers were forced to purchase electricity from a company that bad been given the franchise for a particular geographical area, known as the <b>Regional</b> <b>Electricity</b> <b>Company</b> or REC.

50|$|The {{company was}} formed in 2000 by Order of the Council of Ministers through a merger of {{existing}} <b>regional</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>companies</b> in the Central, Eastern, Western and Southern regions into a single joint stock company. In 2009, the Electricity and Cogeneration Regulatory Authority (ECRA) announced its intention to split the company into four generation companies and separate transmission and distribution companies to encourage competition in the domestic utilities sector. A transmission company - National Grid SA - was established in 2012 to operate the national grid.|$|R
50|$|The {{companies}} affected {{were those}} privatized by the Telecommunications Act 1984, the Airports Act 1986, the Gas Act 1986, the Water Act 1989, the Electricity Act 1989 (and the Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992) and the Railways Act 1993. The firms affected were BAA, British Energy, British Gas (now BG plc and Centrica), British Telecom, National Power, Northern Ireland Electricity, Powergen, Scottish Hydro, Scottish Power and Railtrack, the <b>regional</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>companies</b> and the privatized water and sewerage companies (including such companies now forming part of Hyder, United Utilities and Scottish Power).|$|R
50|$|The {{shares in}} National Grid were {{distributed}} to the <b>regional</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>companies</b> prior to their own privatisation in 1990. PowerGen and National Power were privatised in 1991, with 60% stakes in each company sold to investors, the remaining 40% being held by the UK government. The privatisation process was initially delayed as {{it was concluded that}} the 'earlier decided nuclear power plant assets in National Power' would not be included in the private National Power. A new company was formed, Nuclear Electric, which would eventually own and operate the nuclear power assets, and the nuclear power stations were held in public ownership for a number of years.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{estimates of}} the customer-level demand for electricity by industrial and commercial customers purchasing electricity according to the half-hourly energy prices from the England and Wales (E&W) electricity market. These customers also face {{the possibility of a}} demand charge on its electricity consumption during the three half-hour periods that are coincident with E&W system peaks. Although energy charges are largely known by 4 PM the day prior to consumption, a fraction of the energy charge and the identity of the half-hour periods when demand charges occur are only known with certainty ex post of consumption. Four years of data from a <b>Regional</b> <b>Electricity</b> <b>Company</b> (REC) in the United Kingdom is used to quantify the half-hourly customer-level demands under this real-time pricing program. The econometric model developed and estimated here quantifies the extent of intertemporal substitution in electricity consumption across pricing periods within the day due to changes [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for radial distributed network planning with using ACO algorithm. Ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) {{is one of the}} best methods for optimization in difficult discrete problems. The new algorithm determines the optimal configuration of network and voltage level of each section of the feeders and calculates the optimum rating of the transformers and the size of each section of the feeders. This algorithm applied to a real 23 -feeder radial test network of Gilan <b>Regional</b> <b>Electricity</b> <b>Company</b> inIran. The results validate the superiority of new algorithm in comparison with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and supplying area algorithm. The important characteristics of this algorithm in this paper are its high speed in solving problems for instance 240 times of supplying area algorithm time and 18 times of PSO algorithm time and 10 % decreasing of final cost because of considering the transformers rating as an another searching space variable...|$|E

50|$|The key {{reasons for}} this shift were: (a) political: The {{privatization}} of the UK electricity industry in 1990; the regulatory change that allowed gas {{to be used as}} a fuel for power generation; (b) economic: the high interest rates of the time, which favoured gas turbine power stations, which were quick to build, over coal and nuclear power stations, which were larger but slower to build; the decline in wholesale gas prices; the desire by the <b>regional</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>companies</b> to diversify their sources of electricity supply and establish a foothold in the profitable generation market; (c) technical: advances in electricity generation technology (specifically combined cycle gas turbine generators (CCGT) with higher relative efficiencies and lower capital costs. An underpinning factor in the dash for gas was the recent development of North Sea gas.|$|R
40|$|In December 1990, the 12 <b>regional</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>companies</b> — {{responsible}} for the distribution and supply of electricity in England and Wales — were privatised. For {{the first few years}} following privatisation, real prices, profits and costs in the industry rose. Following two Price Control Reviews, prices have now fallen sharply and there have been substantial reductions in costs and more recently in profits. This paper attempts to conduct a social cost-benefit analysis of the privatisation by examining actual and predicted falls in costs over the period to 2005. We conclude that the privatisation did yield significant net benefits but that these were unevenly distributed across time and groups in society. Relative to our preferred counterfactual, consumers experience slightly lower prices and the government gains £ 5 billion in sale proceeds and net taxes. However, consumers begin to gain only from 2000. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} studying effect of technology based abilities and its aspect on organizational innovation and evaluates {{the relationship between}} these 2 variables for better compatibility of service organizations with environment and society.

40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} the Cox {{proportional}} hazard model (Cox PHM), {{a statistical}} model, for the analysis of early-failure data associated with power cables. The Cox PHM analyses simultaneously a set of covariates and identifies those which have significant effects on the cable failures. In order to demonstrate the appropriateness of the model, relevant historical failure data related to medium voltage (MV, rated at 10 kV) distribution cables and High Voltage (HV, 110 kV and 220 kV) transmission cables have been collected from a <b>regional</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>company</b> in China. Results prove that the model is more robust than the Weibull distribution, in that failure data {{does not have to be}} homogeneous. Results also demonstrate that the method can single out a case of poor manufacturing quality with a particular cable joint provider by using a statistical hypothesis test. The proposed approach can potentially help to resolve any legal dispute that may arise between a manufacturer and a network operator, in addition to providing guidance for improving future practice in cable procurement, design, installations and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|In April 2001, the {{generation}} unit of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) was split into six subsidiary companies with further plans for privatization. But, {{the process of}} privatization has ceased due to changes in political environment. This study analyzes {{the performance of the}} restructuring of generation units using financial and physical indices. The results from the analysis also show that the restructuring has had positive effect on their performance. The financial indices of {{the generation}} companies also show that the prices of fuels, intervention of government, and capability of management affect the performance of the companies. Although the results do not show that restructuring favorably affected the prices of electricity, the indices of liability and profitability show some promising signs arising from the electricity sector reform. To maintain these changes, further liberalization needs to be followed, although there are some issues that need to be dealt with prior to restructuring and privatization plans. The problems of proper reserve margin, the negative effect of <b>regional</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>company,</b> and the conflict between cost saving and preserving environment are some of those need to be dealt with. Those problems can be solved by institutional reform and further liberalization. 1...|$|E
50|$|In 1990, the {{electricity}} industry of England and Wales was privatised under the Electricity Act 1989. Three generating <b>companies</b> and 12 <b>regional</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>companies</b> were created. As {{a result of}} privatisation, Drax Power Station came under the ownership of National Power, one of the newly formed generating companies. Over {{the years that followed}} privatisation, the map of the industry changed dramatically. One significant change was the emergence of vertically integrated companies, combining generation, distribution and supply interests. In certain cases, it became necessary for generation assets to be divested, and so in 1999 Drax Power Station was acquired by the US-based AES Corporation for £1.87 billion (US$3 billion). A partial re-financing of Drax was completed in 2000, with £400 million of senior bonds being issued by AES Drax Holdings, and £267 million of subordinated debt issued by AES Drax Energy.|$|R
40|$|Success in 'greening' a {{business}} organization {{is likely to}} depend on an appropriate environmental management structure being developed {{in accordance with the}} general structure of the organization and then receiving the appropriate support from senior and middle management.

40|$|Over {{the next}} few years, the UK {{government}} plans to split the functions of electricity distribution and marketing. We discuss how prepayment and other metering systems {{can be adapted to}} cope. We propose a key management scheme whereby the distributor can delegate authority over a meter to a marketing company, which in turn can delegate to its agent. Our scheme controls risk by enabling the distributor to reconcile energy with cash and to revoke agents or even marketing companies that default, and to regain control over the meter. 1 Introduction At present, the <b>regional</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>companies</b> are responsible for both the distribution and marketing of electricity. However, by April 1998 this will change: there will still be a single distributor in each geographical area, who will buy electricity from generators via the national grid and provide the reticulation with which it is delivered to homes and businesses. However, the end users will no longer have a contract with the distributor, [...] ...|$|R
