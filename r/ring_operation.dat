5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second <b>ring</b> <b>operation</b> and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E

50|$|After {{working with}} the Federal Bureau of Investigation for about 10 years, Leon G. Turrou led the {{investigation}} into a Nazi spy <b>ring</b> <b>operation</b> in 1938. Although three Nazi spies were convicted and imprisoned and Turrou became famous, he deeply disappointed the F.B.I. for leaking information about {{the case to the}} New York press and writing a series of articles about the case for a newspaper. During his interrogation of the spies he told them they'd have to testify before a grand jury, which led to many of them fleeing the country, so that four times as many spies escaped as were captured. The F.B.I. today considers him to have bungled the case. Turrou was fired from the F.B.I. in June 1937. During the trial itself, which took place in October 1938, his testimony was tainted by accusations of seeking to make money and fame from the case, as well as witness tampering and taking a bribe from Dr. Greibl. The F.B.I. believed Turrou had made the organization look amateurish, unable to defend the nation against espionage.|$|E

The principle of zero determination is as follows： by the estimate of the Mahler measure for α and by the interval for α，we can correctly determine whether α is zero or not with a finite precision value of approximation. We propose two practical usages of the principle. One method computes both intervals and the Mahler measures simultaneously. The other method utilizes a history of computation to compute the Mahler measures only when they are required.

40|$|The maximum {{available}} {{free length}} in the straight {{sections of the}} BESSY II storage ring will be 5. 6 m. A by-pass option for BESSY II could be of interest if extra long insertion devices are to be installed. A simple approach of such an option is suggested here, which offers a 14. 5 m long straight section. Optical beam parameters and the required hardware modifications for aby-pass section are presented. The by-pass operation should be optional to the storage ring mode with a minimum impact on the regular storage <b>ring</b> <b>operation.</b> The suggested solution for the by-pass fits into the ring tunnel. All additional magnets are of the same type as presently planned or constructed for the storage ring. The beam optics are closely matched to the storage <b>ring</b> <b>operation,</b> i. e. the transversal emittance will not change. Solutions for a single by-pass and a double by-pass are discussed. The construction scheme of the by-pass is in both cases nearly identical. The single by-pass solution is based on different radio-frequencies (rf) for booster and storage ring and this mismatch {{requires a lot of}} effort for controlling rf and injection of the two machines. In case of the double by-pass solution both rings run at the same (the nominal) rf, which is celarly an advantage. However, the disadvantage of this solution is that there are twice as many cells of the storage ring involved in the by-pass operation. First, we present the construction scheme for a by-pass cell, then a single and double by-pass solution are discussed. (orig.)

40|$|We {{study the}} {{complexity}} of securely evaluating arithmetic circuits over finite rings. This question is motivated by natural secure computation tasks. Focusing mainly {{on the case of}} two-party protocols with security against malicious parties, our main goals are to: (1) only make black-box calls to the <b>ring</b> <b>operations</b> and standard cryptographic primitives, and (2) minimize the number of such black-box calls as well as the communication overhead. We present several solutions which differ in their efficiency, generality, and underlying intractability assumptions. These include: • An unconditionally secure protocol in the OT-hybrid model which makes a black-box use of an arbitrary ring R, but where the number of <b>ring</b> <b>operations</b> grows linearly with (an upper bound on) log |R|. • Computationally secure protocols in the OT-hybrid model which make a black-box use of an underlying ring, and in which the number of <b>ring</b> <b>operations</b> does not grow with the ring size. The protocols rely on variants of previous intractability assumptions related to linear codes. In the most efficient instance of these protocols, applied to a suitable class of fields, the (amortized) communication cost is a constant number of field elements per multiplication gate and the computational cost is dominated by O(log k) field operations per gate, where k is a security parameter. These results extend a previous approach of Naor and Pinkas for secure polynomial evaluation (SIAM J. Comput., 35 (5), 2006). • A protocol for the rings Zm = Z/mZ which only makes a black-box use of a homomorphic encryption scheme. When m is prime, the (amortized) number of calls to the encryption scheme for each gate of the circuit is constant. All of our protocols are in fact UC-secure in the OT-hybrid model and can be generalized to multiparty computation with an arbitrary number of malicious parties...|$|R
