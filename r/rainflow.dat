40|$|Over {{the past}} 10 - 15 years WWTP control system {{performance}} has improved significantly by increased usage of on-line WWTP data. It is now time {{to extend the}} intensive use of on-line data to the sewer system, where on-line data can be used within control of both sewer and WWTP. A generic methodology for exploiting on-line sewer system data - as discussed in this paper - have revealed that these data seem as useful for good control as on-line WWTP data. Also, the integrated approach where sewer data are used for WWTP control and vice versa has proven successful and valuable. The critical step in using on-line sewer system data is to select sufficiently efficient methods for data reduction and information extraction. An approach to this is proposed, where on-line data are evaluated {{to distinguish between the}} stable dry weather situations and clear rain situations.

These methods include a probabilistic approach {{in which the}} expected value of the rate of damage accumulation is computed by integrating over the probability density of damaging events and a method which consists of analyzing the response time history to count damaging events. It is noted {{that it is necessary}} to employ a time domain approach to perform <b>Rainflow</b> counting, while simple peak counting may be accomplished using the probabilistic method. Data obtained indicate that <b>Rainflow</b> counting produces significantly different fatigue life predictions than other methods that are commonly used in acoustic fatigue predictions.

40|$|<b>Rainflow</b> cycles {{are often}} used to {{describe}} variability of loads and stresses relevant for fatigue of metals. To each cycle there is attributed a damage, and the total fatigue damage due to a load {{is the sum of}} individual damages. For random loads computation of expected damage intensity is difficult. Conservative bounds for the damage intensity can be derived from the upcrossing intensity. In the special case of Markov loads the explicit formula for the oscillation intensity, which is a one to one function of a <b>rainflow</b> matrix, is known.

40|$|<b>Rainflow</b> cycles {{are often}} used in fatigue {{analysis}} of materials for describing the variability of applied loads. Therefore, an important characteristic of a random load process is the intensity of <b>rainflow</b> cycles, also called the expected <b>rainflow</b> matrix (RFM), {{which can be used}} for evaluation of the fatigue life. In this thesis mainly two problems are addressed: the first is computation of the expected RFM for a given load model; and the second is modelling of a load from its RFM. Special interest is given to switching random loads, which are random loads where the stochastic properties change over time, due to changes of the system dynamics. For a vehicle, the change of properties could reflect different driving conditions. The first Markov model to be considered is a Markov chain (MC). In <b>rainflow</b> analysis only the local extremes, also called turning points, of the load are of interest. Hence, another very useful approach in applications is to apply a Markov chain of turning points (MCTP) model. Both switching Markov chains and switching Markov chains of turning points are considered as models for switching loads. The switching is modelled by a Markov chain, which leads to a so called hidden Markov model. The problem of computing the expected RFM is solved for all the Markov models described above, including the switching loads, and the results are explicit matrix formulas. <b>Rainflow</b> inversion, which is the problem of computing a load model given an expected RFM, is solved for the MCTP model. A switching load gives rise to a mixed RFM. Methods for decomposition of a measured mixed RFM are derived, where estimates of the proportions and the switching frequencies of the subloads, as well as estimates of the models for the subloads can be obtained. By including side-information in the decomposition the accuracy of the estimates can be improved. The <b>rainflow</b> inversion and decomposition can be used for generating random load sequences from a measured RFM. Finally, the exact distribution of the number of interval crossings by a MC for a finite time horizon is computed. Crossings of intervals have a direct connection to <b>rainflow</b> cycles.

The effects of <b>rainflow</b> cycle counting and fatigue crack closure are included. A method {{for determining the}} opening stress in a random loading is also proposed. This research takes a fatigue damage factor approach. The damage factor {{is defined as the}} ratio of the wide band <b>rainflow</b> fatigue damage to the equivalent narrow band fatigue damage. The mathematical form of the damage factor equations is derived from theoretical derivations using the analytically tractable local range cycle counting method. Simulations of stationary Gaussian random processes are used to empirically derive the values of certain parameters dependent on the spectral shape for the <b>rainflow</b> cycle counting equations.

40|$|<b>Rainflow</b> {{counting}} methods {{convert a}} complex load time history into {{a set of}} load reversals for use in fatigue damage modeling. <b>Rainflow</b> counting methods were originally developed to assess fatigue damage associated with mechanical cycling where creep of the material under load was {{not considered to be}} a significant contributor to failure.

40|$|The <b>rainflow</b> {{method is}} used for {{counting}} fatigue cycles from a stress response time history, where the fatigue cycles are stress-reversals. The <b>rainflow</b> method allows the application of Palmgren-Miner's rule {{in order to assess}} the fatigue life of a structure subject to complex loading. The fatigue damage may also be calculated from a stress response power spectral density (PSD) using the semi-empirical Dirlik, Single Moment, Zhao-Baker and other spectral methods. These methods effectively assume that the PSD has a corresponding time history which is stationary with a normal distribution. This paper shows how the probability density function for <b>rainflow</b> stress cycles can be extracted from each of the spectral methods. This extraction allows for the application of the MIL-HDBK- 5 J fatigue coefficients in the cumulative damage summation. A numerical example is given in this paper for the stress response of a beam undergoing random base excitation, where the excitation is applied separately by a time history and by its corresponding PSD.

40|$|Traditional fatigue {{analysis}} uses {{a technique called}} <b>rainflow</b> cycle counting to decompose a variable amplitude time signal of stress into fatigue cycles. The damage from each cycle is computed using a Wöhler curve and the damage over the entire time signal is calculated by summing the damage from all the individual cycles. In the case of acoustic and high-cycle fatigue, a long duration of time signal is often {{required in order to}} obtain a statistically representative fatigue estimate. FE-based design analysis of dynamic components using such long time signals is often rendered impractical on account of a computationally intensive forced response analysis. In most cases the loads are found to be random (or sine-on-random) in nature, and PSD are often used to describe the random loads in a more efficient manner. This representation also facilitates a very efficient FE analysis technique based on harmonic response rather than the forced response approach which is required for time signals. This paper introduces several techniques for <b>rainflow</b> cycle counting directly from a resultant PSD of stress. It compares these techniques with traditional <b>rainflow</b> analysis and concludes with a case study showing how the PSD-based analysis was used during the design of an exhaust muffler for a new city bus. ...|$|E

In this process, {{the determination of the}} kernel function shape is the critical issue, which has been discussed in detail. Before extrapolating the sample load spectrum, the signal denoising of the field-tested time-history load signals is performed. After that, the sample load cycles are obtained using the <b>rainflow</b> counting method and the corresponding kernel function shape is determined.

The method is exempliøed by a measurement of a vehicle load where the non-stationarity is modelled by piecewise constant mean and linear standard deviation. The transformed Gaussian model is found by non-parametrically øtting the level crossing intensity to data.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{outlines}} the use of power spectral density data for estimating the Fatigue Damage of structures or components subjected to random loading. Since <b>rainflow</b> cycle counting has been accepted {{as the best way}} of estimating the fatigue damage caused by random loadings, an obvious target was a method of obtaining the <b>rainflow</b> range distribution from the PSD. Such a solution is derived in this thesis. It forms the major part of the work presented and appears in chapter 5. The rest of the thesis deals with the following topics; Chapter 3 first presents some empirical solutions developed by other authors for the prediction of <b>rainflow</b> ranges from PSD's. An empirical solution developed by Dirlik in 1985 is then used to investigate the effect that stresses contained within a given frequency range have on fatigue damage when there are other frequencies present in the PSD plot. This {{can be thought of as}} 'fatigue damage potential'. Interactions between stresses in different frequency intervals are investigated and it is shown that the fatigue damage potential of one frequency interval is dependent not only on the magnitude of that interval but on the magnitudes of other frequency intervals present. This 'Interaction' effect within the PSD plot, is of specific interest because it can be used to determine the change of fatigue damage for any given structure or component when parts of the signal or PSD plot are altered. Chapter 4 is concerned with methods of regenerating a signal from a PSD in the form of a set of peaks and troughs. Work by Kowalewsld in 1963 is introduced which gives a solution for the joint distribution of peaks and troughs. This distribution can be used to generate a continuous set of adjacent peaks and troughs, of any length, using Monte-Carlo techniques. Approximations in this result are discussed, in comparison with the (distribution of times between) zero crossings problem. An improvement to this joint distribution of peak and troughs is given which uses an empirical solution for the distribution of 'ordinary ranges' (ranges between adjacent peaks and troughs). Chapter 5 forms the major part of the original work presented in this thesis and outlines a theoretical solution for the prediction of <b>rainflow</b> ranges using statistics computed directly from the power spectral density plot. The <b>rainflow</b> range mechanism is broken down into a set of logical criteria which can be analyzed using Markov process theory. The dependence between extremes in this instance is modelled using the prediction of the joint distribution of peaks and troughs proposed by Kowalewsld, and shown in chapter 4. Chapter 6 deals with the fatigue damage assessment and stress history determination of components when only limited samples of the service data are available. An investigation is carried out into the relative merits of time and frequency domain techniques. In particular, the effect of finite sample length was investigated with particular reference to the variance of fatigue predictions using both a <b>rainflow</b> count on a limited time sample and a <b>rainflow</b> count produced directly from a PSD of the same time sample. The frequency domain approach is shown to be at least as accurate as the direct time domain approach. Chapter 7 deals with one specific area where the methods presented in this thesis are applicable, namely, dynamically sensitive offshore structures. Various methods of fatigue damage assessment are highlighted, followed by a detailed description of the 'deterministic/spectral' approach. Many factors which have not previously been recognised are investigated and shown to have significant effect, for instance, tidal effects...|$|E
