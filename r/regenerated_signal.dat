40|$|Im Rahmen der Doktorarbeit wurden zwei neuartige rein-optische 3 R Regeneratoren für hochratige Signalverarbeitung entwickelt, die ausschließlich auf kompakten Halbleiterkomponenten mit hohem Integrationspotenzial basieren. Beide 3 R Architekturen wurden sowohl anhand numerischer Simulationen als auch experimentell detailliert analysiert. Die Ergebnisse werden vergleichend diskutiert und genutzt, um die Signal-Regeneration von 40 Gbit/s PRBS RZ Daten-Strömen zu optimieren. Die erste 3 R Schlüsselkomponente ist der selbstpulsierende PhaseCOMB-Laser (Phase Controlled Mode Beating), der für rein-optische Taktrückgewinnung genutzt wird. Diese Komponente ist eine bekannte Entwicklung des FhG-HHI. In der Arbeit wird das Potenzial des PhaseCOMB-Lasers für den Einsatz in einem 3 R Regenerator evaluiert. Insbesondere wurde der Einfluss von starken Daten-Degradationen verschiedenen Ursprungs auf die Zeitstabilität des Clock-Signals untersucht, um damit die Robustheit der Clock gegenüber Störungen, die typischerweise in realen Übertragungssystemen auftreten, zu verifizieren. Speziell in Hinblick auf den Einsatz in asynchronen Netzen wurde weiterhin die Burst-Fähigkeit der PhaseCOMB-Clock eingehend analysiert. Die Ergebnisse bestimmten das Design der 3 R Schaltkreise, die für den asynchronen Betrieb optimiert wurden. Die zweite Schlüsselkomponente basiert auf Halbleiterverstärkern. Dabei wurde die Länge der Komponente als Optimierungs-Parameter zum ersten Mal systematisch untersucht und ausgenutzt. Hierzu wurden in der FhG-HHI Technologie ultra-lange SOAs (UL-SOA) zwischen 2 mm und 8 mm hergestellt. Das Ziel war es, die Nichtlinearitäten über die Länge eines Halbleiterverstärkers effektiver zu nutzen. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass die ultra-schnellen (< 1 ps) Intra-Band Cross-Gain Effekte mit der SOA Länge immer stärker zur Gain-Sättigung beitragen und schließlich dominieren. Darüber hinaus wurde erkannt, dass auch bei den Inter-Band Effekten die Erholzeit deutlich beschleunigt wird. Diese geht in einem 8 mm UL-SOA herunter bis zu 10 ps, im Vergleich zu ~ 100 ps bei einem konventionellen kurzen SOA. Die schnelle Erholzeit ermöglicht es, die UL-SOAs und Inter-Band Effekte für hochratige optische Signal-Verarbeitung bei 40 Gbit/s und höher auszunutzen. Die Eigenschaften der oben {{genannten}} Halbleiter-Funktionselemente wurden in einer neuartigen Anordnung (FhG-HHI Patent) vereint. Die Kombination der effektiven und schnellen Gain-Dynamik der ultra-langen SOAs zusammen mit der hohen zeitlichen Stabilität des optischen Clock-Signals führt zum regenerativen Verhalten der periodisch modulierten UL-SOAs. Der periodisch modulierte UL-SOA bildet die Grundlage der beiden in dieser Arbeit entwickelten optischen 3 R Architekturen, dem ‚Optically-Clocked’ 3 R (OC- 3 R) Regenerator und dem ‚Alternating Data-Clock’ 3 R (ADC- 3 R) Regenerator. Die Signal-Regeneration im wellenlängen-erhaltenden ‚Optically-Clocked’ 3 R Regenerator basiert auf einem effektiven Carving der degradierten Datenpulse, die sich gemeinsam mit dem periodischen Taktsignal der Clock durch den gesättigten UL-SOA ausbreiten. Die dominante Clock bestimmt die Sättigungsverhältnisse und dadurch die Regenerationseffizienz des periodisch getakteten Verstärkers, während das schwache Daten-Signal unter Erhalt der Wellenlänge regeneriert wird. Der Einfluss von unterschiedlichen Daten-Degradationen (Amplituden-Fluktuationen, zeitliche Instabilität, OSNR Verringerung) auf die Funktionalität des optischen 3 R Regenerators wurde detailliert untersucht, um die optimale Arbeitsbedingungen zu definieren. Anschließend wurde das Einsatzpotenzial des OC- 3 Rs zur Korrektur der Polarisations-Moden-Dispersion (PMD), der residualen Chromatischen Dispersion (CD) und zur Regeneration von asynchronen 40 Gbit/s Datenströme (kurze PRBS Pakete) evaluiert. In der zweiten 3 R Architektur, dem ‚Alternating Data-Clock’ 3 R Regenerator, wird die Signal-Regeneration mit einer Wellenlängen-Umsetzung kombiniert. Anders als bei konventionellen 3 R Schaltkreisen, wird im ADC- 3 R die Ausgangswellenlänge des regenerierten Daten-Signals von einem im ganzen C-Band flexibel wählbaren (z. B. ITU Raster) CW Signal definiert. Die Zeitlage der konvertierten Daten-Pulse wird auch in diesem Schema durch das stabile Clock-Signal bestimmt. Das regenerative Potenzial der ADC- 3 R Architektur wurde sowohl für unterschiedliche Degradationen der 40 Gbit/s PRBS RZ Datenströme als auch für verschiedene Wellenlängen-Kombinationen ausführlich analysiert, um die typischen Eigenschaften dieses kompakten 3 R Schaltkreises zu evaluieren. In {{framework of}} this thesis, two novel all-optical semiconductor based 3 R regenerators {{have been developed}} and optimised for operation in 40 Gbit/s PRBS RZ data streams. The key functional components of both proposed architectures are a self-pulsating PhaseCOMB-laser (Phase Controlled Mode Beating) for all-optical clock recovery and an ultra-long semiconductor optical amplifier (UL-SOA) applied in the 3 R circuits for effective exploitation of fast nonlinearities. The semiconductor devices were designed and fabricated in the technology of FhG-HHI. In the thesis, the experimental investigations on the device characteristics as well as assembled 3 R architectures are supported by detailed numerical analysis. Based on the simulations, the physical background of the exploited novel effects is explained and the optimised operation conditions are identified. The PhaseCOMB-clock is a compact three-sections laser providing all-optical clock extraction from PRBS signals. In this work, {{the potential of the}} optical clock for application in a 3 R regeneration scheme is analysed. The system performance and robustness of the selected devices was studied by operation in 40 Gbit/s data streams. The impact of different signal degradations on the timing stability of the recovered clock signal was evaluated in detail. Furthermore, the burst-mode feasibility of the PhaseCOMB-clock was investigated. The results were later used by design of the proposed 3 R schemes optimised for processing of asynchronous packet flows. In case of the UL-SOA, the device length as an important optimisation parameter was systematically studied and exploited in this work for the first time. Semiconductor amplifiers of different lengths between 2 mm and 8 mm were fabricated. The purpose was to exploit more effectively the nonlinearities needed for fast optical signal processing. It could be demonstrated that the impact of ultra-fast (< 1 ps) intra-band cross gain effects on the total gain saturation clearly increases when enhancing the SOA length. Subsequently, {{it was found that the}} inter-band transitions are also effectively accelerated in the long devices. Gain recovery time constants down to 10 ps were evaluated for an 8 mm UL-SOA compared to ~ 100 ps typically measured for conventional SOAs with a length below 1 mm. Hence, the fast inter-band XGM effects make the long devices attractive for high speed (40 + Gbit/s) optical signal processing. The unique characteristics of the aforementioned semiconductor components have been exploited in a novel configuration (FhG-HHI patent). The combination of the effective and fast gain dynamics of the ultra-long amplifiers together with the high timing stability of the optical clock signal results in regenerative behaviour of periodically modulated UL-SOAs. The periodically modulated UL-SOA is the basis for both all-optical 3 R schemes developed in the framework of this thesis: the ‘Optically Clocked’ 3 R regenerator (OC- 3 R) and the ‘Alternating Data-Clock’ 3 R regenerator (ADC- 3 R). The ‘Optically Clocked’ 3 R regenerator is a wavelength-preserving scheme. The signal regeneration is performed by effective carving of degraded data pulses, when propagating through the saturated long amplifier periodically modulated by the stable clock signal. The dominant clock determines the saturation conditions in the long amplifier and, thus, the regeneration efficiency of the proposed scheme. The quality of the weak PRBS data signal is restored without any wavelength conversion. The impact of amplitude fluctuations, timing instabilities as well as reduced data OSNR on the performance of the OC- 3 R regenerator was investigated in detail in order to define the optimised operation conditions of the proposed 3 R scheme. Furthermore, the capability of the OC- 3 R for mitigation of polarisation mode dispersion (PMD) and residual chromatic dispersion (CD) as well as regeneration of 40 Gbit/s asynchronous PRBS packet flows is demonstrated. The second 3 R architecture introduced in this work, the ‘Alternating Data-Clock’ 3 R regenerator, combines signal regeneration with wavelength conversion. In contrary to conventional 3 R circuits, the output wavelength of the <b>regenerated</b> <b>signal</b> is defined by a CW source and, thus, can be flexibly tuned in the whole C-band (e. g. ITU grid). Also in this scheme, the timing position of the converted data pulses is determined by the stable clock signal. In this work, the regenerative ability of the ADC- 3 R operated in 40 Gbit/s PRBS RZ data streams is studied for different signal degradations and wavelength combinations in order to evaluate the typical features of the proposed compact 3 R circuit...|$|E

Fault and attack survivability issues concerning physical security in a DWDM All-Optical Transport Network (AOTN) require a new approach taking into consideration AOTN physical characteristics. Furthermore, unlike in electronic networks that <b>regenerate</b> <b>signals</b> at every node, attack detection and isolation schemes may not have access to the overhead bits used to transport supervisory information between regenerators or switching sites to perform their functions. This paper presents an analysis of attack and protection problems in an AOTN. Considering this, we propose a framework for QoS guarantees based on the Differentiated MPLS Service (DMS) model and QoS recovery schemes against QoS degradation caused by devices failures or attack-induced faults in an AOTN. We also suggest how to integrate our attack management model into the NIST's simulator [...] Modeling, Evaluation and Research of Lightwave Networks (MERLiN) ...|$|R

The main aims of PIC are to <b>regenerate</b> the <b>signal</b> mixed with MAI and recover the useful signal from the desired user. It is normally operated in two stages. In the first stage, the initial data estimates due to interfering users is estimated using (15) with suitable combining method and PIC is applied using (14) to regenerate and cancel MAI existing in the received signal. In the second stage, the interference-cancelled signal is combined using MRC to form PIC-MRC.|$|R

The Strowger switch, the Panel switch, and similar ones were {{widely used in}} early automated telephone exchanges. Crossbar switches were first widely installed in the middle 20th century in Sweden, the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, and these quickly spread {{to the rest of}} the world - especially to Japan. The electromechanical television systems of the late 19th century were less successful.|$|R
