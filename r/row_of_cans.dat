50|$|The {{method for}} {{stacking}} the cans involves creating a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>cans</b> separated by hand-formed “lumps” of concrete. The layout of a row is can, concrete, can, etc. This is then repeated, {{except that the}} alternating pattern is reversed, so that every can is laid {{on top of a}} concrete “lump” below it. This continues until completed, or the weight of the wall and the hardness of the cement seem questionable in terms of solidity. At that point {{it would be wise to}} wait for the wall to harden, but the laying time for cans and concrete is such that by the time a builder makes it back to an area that was recently laid it has had time to set. It is a judgment call as to whether or not the builder should continue, but by the next day or even later in the same day building can resume.|$|E
5000|$|To {{teach the}} student hip-shooting with a handgun, McDaniel would {{begin with an}} S&W K-frame {{double-action}} [...]22 target-revolver (any other carefully made brand of medium-to-large-frame double-action [...]22 target-revolver would have worked as well). That particular gun {{was about the same}} size, shape, and weight as the typical [...]38 special holster-gun carried by uniformed policemen in the 1950s; and it made very little noise and had very little recoil. The student began by hip-shooting the [...]22 revolver at a row of six quart-cans 21 feet (6.5m) away. He would pivot on his feet to face the first (left-side) beer can; focus upon a point {{at the center of the}} can while he drew the gun and pulled the trigger; note which direction and by how far the bullet missed his aiming point on that can; decide instantly to miss that point on the next can the same distance but in the opposite direction; leave the gun in position and pivot to face the next can and pull the trigger as soon as he was facing the can; and so on, until he had fired at the entire <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>cans.</b> Usually he would learn to hit them consistently very rapidly, and McDaniel could then work down the size of the targets. When the student could regularly draw and hip-shoot a row of empty [...]22-short cartridge cases at 21 feet, McDaniel would have thestudent change over to his carry gun (usually a [...]38 Special), and repeat the process.|$|E
