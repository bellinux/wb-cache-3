5|$|A {{development}} {{in recent years}} that seeks to address these issues has been termed evidence-based medicine. As its name suggests, this approach strives to rigorously study the effects of different interventions instead of <b>relying</b> on logic or tradition. Jeffrey Arnold argues that its application worldwide could lead to the boon of sharing best practices between emergency medicine practitioners in various countries, thus advancing the current standard of emergency care.|$|E

5|$|Although an RST cannot {{distinguish}} GAS infection from asymptomatic carriage of the organism, most authorities recommend antibiotic {{treatment in}} the event of a positive RST result from a person with a sore throat.

5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, <b>relying</b> on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E
5|$|Bands {{to emerge}} from other major British cities {{included}} The Animals from Newcastle, Them from Belfast and the Spencer Davis Group and The Moody Blues from Birmingham.

5|$|During the American Revolutionary War (17751783), the Continental Army made {{relatively}} little use of cavalry, primarily <b>relying</b> on infantry {{and a few}} dragoon regiments. The United States Congress eventually authorized regiments specifically designated as cavalry in 1855. The newly formed American cavalry adopted tactics based on experiences fighting over vast distances during the Mexican War (18461848) and against indigenous peoples on the western frontier, abandoning some European traditions.|$|E

5|$|FreeBSD has {{similarities}} with Linux, {{with two}} major differences {{in scope and}} licensing: FreeBSD maintains a complete operating system, i.e. the project delivers kernel, device drivers, userland utilities and documentation, as opposed to Linux delivering a kernel and drivers only and <b>relying</b> on third-parties for system software; and FreeBSD source code is generally released under a permissive BSD license {{as opposed to the}} copyleft GPL used by Linux.|$|E

5|$|In September 1939, Britain and France {{declared}} war on Germany following the German invasion of Poland. The Anglo-French Supreme War Council decided {{to stay on the}} defensive along the border, <b>relying</b> on the Maginot Line in helping counter an anticipated German offensive across the German-French border. As neither side made any offensive moves, a Drôle de Guerre (Phoney War) developed as both sides stood-off along the border.|$|E
5|$|In soft corals, {{there is}} no stony {{skeleton}} but the tissues are often toughened {{by the presence of}} tiny skeletal elements known as sclerites, which are made from calcium carbonate. Soft corals are very variable in form and most are colonial. A few soft corals are stolonate, but the polyps of most are connected by sheets of coenosarc. In some species this is thick and the polyps are deeply embedded. Some soft corals are encrusting or form lobes. Others are tree-like or whip-like and have a central axial skeleton embedded in the tissue matrix. This is composed either of a fibrous protein called gorgonin or of a calcified material. In both stony and soft corals, the polyps can be retracted, with stony corals <b>relying</b> on their hard skeleton and cnidocytes for defence against predators, with soft corals generally <b>relying</b> on chemical defences in the form of toxic substances present in the tissues known as terpenoids.|$|E
