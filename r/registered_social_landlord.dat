40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Scottish Continuous Recording System (SCORE) records lettings data from all participating <b>Registered</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Landlords</b> (RSLs) in Scotland. Information about these tenancies has been collected since 1989. SCORE is funded and managed by the Scottish Government. It provides {{a wide variety of}} data from participating Scottish <b>Registered</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Landlords</b> (RSLs) on new tenancies that are created. This includes household profile, reasons for moving, financial situation, homelessness status and previous accommodation. SCORE data collection is continuous as information is received from <b>Registered</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Landlords.</b> More specifically, data is collected at the time of letting and then uploaded using the SCORE online system. It is not mandatory for RSLs to provide their lettings data to SCORE. Equivalent information on Local Authority social housing lettings is not currently collected via SCORE, although this is planned within the next few years. SCORE data was first collected in 1989 and covers an annual 1 st April to the 31 st March period. Data is available in annual chunks from the 1 st April to the 31 st March and made available in July of each year. At the moment, the SCORE records available to researchers start from the 1 st April 1992. As at December 2009, the dataset covered 85 % of lettings made by <b>social</b> <b>landlords.</b> Some letting types are excluded such as successions, assignments and households in temporary accommodation. SCORE only records those social housing lettings made by <b>registered</b> <b>social</b> <b>landlords</b> and not local authorities at present. Summary information on SCORE data is produced throughout the year and published on the SCORE website. There is also an online reporting system and a facility to download the raw SCORE data, but this is restricted to participating <b>Registered</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Landlords.</b> Access to the raw SCORE data is available to researchers, subject to application approval from the Scottish Government. Research Usage and Linkage The SCORE dataset has been used by a number of different organisations including The Scottish Government, The Scottish Federation for Housing Associations, Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland, universities and <b>registered</b> <b>social</b> <b>landlords</b> {{for a wide variety of}} purposes. This has included rent reviews, affordability monitoring, homelessness cases, the route to social housing of tenants and for general housing strategy purposes. Furthermore, it is planned that summary SCORE data will be included in the SNS (Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics). The SCORE dataset could potentially be used in conjunction to CORE, Supporting People in England, or NICORE in Northern Ireland datasets for social housing research. Furthermore, due to the fact that the SCORE data are collected at a unit level, it would be theoretically possible to link the data to other datasets. </div...|$|R

40|$|This article {{starts from}} the {{observation}} that social rented housing in Britain is in transition. Evidence is presented to show the emerging importance of not-for-profit <b>registered</b> <b>social</b> <b>landlords,</b> and the growing significance of stock transfer associations (formed from within the public sector), but {{the main purpose of}} the article is to look at explanations for the current restructuring process. The article provides a critique of established broad-brush perspectives on tenure change in capitalist societies, arguing that they provide no purchase on the contemporary transfer of large amounts of local authority stock to not-for-profit organizations. The final section looks at changes in housing in terms of the wider restructuring of the welfare state and reviews three different approaches to the explanation of the rise of <b>registered</b> <b>social</b> landlords: the promotion of competition through quasi-markets, the apparent resurgence of the voluntary sector and the transition to post-Fordism.

40|$|Urban {{policy in}} several European {{countries}} {{is characterized by}} an increasing emphasis on neighbourhoods as the site for targeted partnership intervention within new forms of multi-level and multi-actor governance. Community processes within distressed neighbourhoods, based on concepts of social capital, are increasingly identified as both the cause of neighbourhood decline and offering mechanisms for achieving social inclusion and social cohesion. Social housing organizations are given a central role within these new forms of governance. This paper utilises a study of <b>registered</b> <b>social</b> <b>landlords</b> (RSLs) in Scotland to explore the role and impact of housing organizations in developing social capital in deprived communities. It identifies a range of mechanisms through which RSLs contribute to social capital and community development, but argues that the limitations and ambiguities of these processes reflect wider problems in the conceptualisation of both social capital and neighbourhood renewal as mechanisms for achieving social inclusion and social cohesion in current European urban policy. Social capital, neighbourhood renewal, community, <b>registered</b> <b>social</b> <b>landlords,...</b>|$|R
50|$|Some <b>landlords,</b> {{particularly}} <b>Registered</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Landlords,</b> operate rent-free {{weeks in}} their tenancies, which {{can have the}} effect of making the benefit reduction appear more severe. The reduction is applied for each week in the year, but housing benefit is only paid for the rent that is due, leading to the reduction effectively being increased, on rent-due weeks, by a factor of 52 : (52 less the number of rent-free weeks).|$|R
40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} by the Welsh Economy Research Unit (WERU) at Cardiff Business School for Community Housing Cymru (CHC). It reports {{the findings of a}} CHC survey of new homes provided by <b>Registered</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Landlords</b> (RSL) in 2007 / 08, estimates the economic impacts of housing associations in Wales, including regeneration, and reviews some of the social and economic implications of housing association activity. The work of housing associations is often difficult to quantify, and, as was recognised in the Essex Review, is seldom fully appreciated by the public at large. Housing Associations (HAs) or <b>Registered</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Landlords</b> (RSLs) are not-for-profit voluntary bodies formed to provide good quality, affordable homes for those in housing need. Improved quality of housing is linked with better health, economic opportunity, access to services and general quality of life for occupiers. Housing Associations also provide modern community facilities, accommodation for students and the aged, as well as rescuing important buildings. Increasingly, they are responsible for innovative projects which go well beyond traditional formula...|$|R
