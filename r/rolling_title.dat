500|$|... eMusic {{contributor}} Dan Epstein {{rated the}} album 4.5 stars out of 5 {{and described the}} interaction between band members similarly to Highter and Currin, saying that, while Mitchell's guitar leads are prominent, Eginton and Rubalcaba are [...] "locked-in" [...] with him and each other, [...] "never los focus or intensity for a second â€” not even during the <b>rolling</b> 30-minute <b>title</b> track." [...] In his review for NOW Magazine, John Semley said that while inferior to Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky, the high point was the opening track, [...] "Violence of the Red Sea", and the album is [...] "an essential record for anyone who likes the sound of guitars sounding like guitars". Karen A. Mann also wrote, for the heavy metal section of About.com, that the opening track was the band's peak performance on the album, which she rated 4 out of 5. Rolling Stone referred to the album {{as one of the}} 20 best metal albums of 2013, while Magnet named it the third best of the year's top ten hard rock releases. Likewise, the Austin Chronicle ranked it ninth in the top ten metal releases of 2013, and later reviewer Raoul Hernandez gave the album a perfect four-star review.

500|$|In the Billboard {{magazine}} {{review of}} the album, contributor Katy Kroll wrote that Timberlake [...] "claims to be bringing 'sexy' back to pop music, and indeed he is. You can almost feel beads of sweat <b>rolling</b> off the <b>title</b> track and 'SexyBack' featuring Timbaland". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly was complimentary towards Timbaland, producer of the song, writing that Timbaland offers [...] "tougher, trickier rhythms, minimal live playing, a plethora of hip-hop cameos, and a self-consciously hard, edgy club sensibility" [...] to [...] "SexyBack". Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald noted, [...] "The producer's angular synthesizer crunch is all over it [...] at best on the single 'SexyBack' where they dispense with a chorus, leaving the song sustained by its vocal fireworks, electrofunk and Timberlake's repeated declaration that 'I'm bringing sexy back. PopMatters' contributor Quentin B. Huff wrote that [...] "SexyBack" [...] was the [...] "fraternal twin" [...] to Nelly Furtado's 2006 song [...] "Promiscuous". Andrew Murfett of The Age wrote that the song was a [...] "raunchy club banger that slyly suppresses" [...] Timberlake's customary falsetto. He continues, [...] "it's introduced a new phrase into the pop cultural lexicon". Glenn Gamboa of Newsday was complimentary towards the song, writing that it was [...] "Timberlake at his best, mainstreaming {{a combination of the}} wild, edgy dance-pop style of Basement Jaxx with Missy Elliott's more experimental hip-hop to create a boldly inventive sound that still pleases the masses." ...|$|R
