5000|$|The {{small heath}} (Coenonympha pamphilus) is a {{butterfly}} species {{belonging to the}} family Nymphalidae, subfamily Satyrinae (commonly known as [...] "the browns"). It is widespread in Eurasia and north-western Africa, preferring drier habitats than other Coenonympha. The larval host plants are grasses, notably sheep's fescue and <b>rough</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>grass</b> Poa trivialis.|$|E
50|$|The {{site is a}} rare {{example of}} neutral {{grassland}} on clay {{which has not been}} improved agriculturally. It is a flood meadow which has been maintained to provide hay with grazing during the winter, and it has a rich variety of plant species. The main grasses are meadow foxtail and <b>rough</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>grass.</b> Old hedgerows add to the diversity of habitats.|$|E
40|$|Diesel oil is {{a complex}} mixture of {{hydrocarbons}} with an average carbon number of C 8 – C 26. The majority of components consist of alkanes, both straight chained and branched and aromatic compounds including mono-, di- and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Regardless of this complexity, diesel oil can be readily degraded {{by a number of}} soil microorganisms making it a likely candidate for bioremediation. The concept of using plants to enhance bioremediation, termed phytoremediation, is a relatively new area of scientific interest. It is particularly applicable to diesel oil contamination as diesel oil generally contaminates the top few metres of soil (surface soil) and contamination is not uniform throughout the site. By encouraging plants to grow on diesel oil contaminated soil, conditions are improved for the microbial degradation of the contaminant. During this study, establishing plants on diesel oil contaminated soil proved difficult. Diesel oil is phytotoxic to plants at relatively low concentrations. At concentrations below this phytotoxic level, the development of plants grown in diesel oil contaminated soil differs greatly from plants grown in uncontaminated soil. Tolerance of plants to diesel oil and ability to germinate in diesel oil contaminated soil varied greatly between plant species as well as within plant species. The broadest differences in germination were seen within the grasses with certain species thriving in low levels of contamination (e. g. Creeping bent) while others were intolerant of diesel oil contamination (e. g. <b>Rough</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>grass).</b> The herbs, legumes and commercial crops screened appeared to be largely unaffected by low levels of diesel oil contamination (25 g diesel kg− 1). At the higher level of contamination (50 g diesel kg− 1), half of the twenty two plants species screened failed to reach a germination rate equal to 50...|$|E

40|$|The {{vesicular-arbuscular}} mycorrhizal fungus Glomus monosporum was inoculated on grapevine (Vitis vinifera), {{red clover}} (Trifolium pratense), <b>meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) and onion (Allium cepa) as hosts in two experiments {{carried out in}} different environments. Grapevine and clover showed the largest growth response and spore production. Mycorrhizal infection was lowest in <b>meadow</b> <b>grass.</b> Very poor correlations were observed, on an overall basis, between spore production and per cent root infection or infected root length. Spore production per unit infected root length for each host species was a comparatively stable parameter; it was largest for grapevine and smallest for <b>meadow</b> <b>grass</b> in both experiments. Sporulation {{was positively correlated with}} growth enhancement by mycorrhizal plants, and growth increments per unit infected root followed the same trend as spore numbers per unit infected root, i. e. largest for grapevine and lowest for meadow-grass. It is concluded that the ability of G. monosporum to produce spores and to enhance plant growth per unit infected root length depends on the host plant species...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{wastewater}} is consideredas effluents, {{which are}} formed {{on the surface}} of urbanized areas. Stormwater treatment is performed out using a variety of filters: sand, grass. Wastewater penetration into the deeper layers is called hydraulic conductivity. After evaluation of the hydraulic conductivity, it is possible to determine the ability of the investigated fillers to entrap the stormwater flow. The hydraulic conductivity tests can indicate which fillers of stormwater filters may influence the more effective stormwater cleaning. Four stormwater filters were tested: crushed autoclaved aerated concrete filter; crushed autoclaved aerated concrete with <b>Meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) layer; silica sand filter with <b>Meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) layer; silica sand filter. Under in-situ conditions hydraulic conductivity in filters is investigated using Constant-head method. Mathematical modeling program Hydrus- 1 D presentsthe changes of hydraulic conductivity in each filler layer of the filter. Assessed hydraulic conductivity in filters under in-situ conditions hasn‘t changed only in crushed autoclaved aerated concrete filter (30 000 mm/d). The smallest hydraulic conductivity in filters under in-situ conditions was estimated in silica sand filter with <b>Meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) layer, here it was equal to 209. 3 mm/d. With mathematical modeling program Hydrus- 1 D {{it was found that the}} hydraulic conductivity in each filter decreases, depending on the depth of filler in the filter...|$|R
