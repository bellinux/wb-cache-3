In the Growlanser series, a Ring Weapon is a new technology where magic rings transform into different weapons depending on the user's personality. Players find these rings often after the defeat of an enemy and can equip different rings for different stat bonuses and different gem-equip slots. There are over 100 types of gems that cause various beneficial effects such as adding extra attacks, more elemental defenses, or increasing range or adding spells to the character's repertoire. These gems all have an innate level and that level must match or be lower than the slot available in the Ring weapon to be equipped. Each Ring Weapon only has 3 gem-slots {{with a level of}} 0-9 for each slot to equip the respective level gems. Additionally, a gem's color must match the color of a <b>ring</b> <b>slot.</b> A gem can be equipped into any given slot, however, penalties are incurred if the gem has a skill that can be learned.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{several studies}} relating to fundamental characterization of CMP consumables in planarization processes. These are also evaluated with {{the purposes of}} minimizing environmental impact and reducing cost of ownership (COO). The first study is conducted to obtain the retaining ring wear rate in a typical ILD CMP process and is specifically intended to investigate the effect of retaining ring materials and slot designs during the CMP process. The results show that retaining ring materials have effect on the COF, pad temperature and retaining ring wear rate, while retaining <b>ring</b> <b>slot</b> designs affect the pad surface abruptness. The second study is performed to compare the effect of different retaining <b>ring</b> <b>slot</b> designs on the slurry film thickness within the pad-wafer interface. A novel non-intrusive optical technique, dual emission UV-enhanced fluorescence (DEUVEF), was applied to accurately measure the film thickness of the slurry underneath the wafer during polishing. It is indicated that the optimized retaining <b>ring</b> <b>slot</b> design can significantly reduce the COO of CMP processes by increasing slurry utilization. A COF method is applied to measure the slurry mean residence time (MRT) during CMP. This technique uses transient COF data induced by a shift in slurry concentration to determine MRT. Variations in consumables as well as sliding velocity, pressure and slurry flow rate can affect the slurry MRT. One study in this dissertation focus {{on the effect of}} retaining <b>ring</b> <b>slot</b> designs on the slurry MRT. Another study compares the slurry MRT under same polishing conditions using pads with different groove width. Both studies are conducted on multiple sliding velocity, pressure and slurry flow rate variations to understand the characteristics of consumable designs. The method of measuring MRT during polishing presented in this dissertation can be easily applied in general CMP processes. The subsequent studies focus in the diamond conditioner discs characterization techniques. A newly developed method for determining active diamonds and aggressive diamonds on a diamond conditioner disc under a certain vertical load is elaborated in this dissertation. Later, this technique together with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging is implemented to analyze diamond pullout and fracture in CMP. Five different types of diamond conditioner discs are subjected to a novel accelerated wear test respectively to compare the extent of diamond pullout and fracture under the same conditioning conditio...|$|E

40|$|Multichannel local-area {{networks}} can {{be constructed}} using fiber-optic wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) techniques. In this paper, WDM is applied to ring networks such as FDDI, token <b>ring,</b> <b>slotted</b> <b>ring,</b> and buffer insertion ring architectures. Crosstalk and insertion loss analyses of grating demultiplexers shows that the ratio of channel separation to channel width must be greater than four. Performance analyses of the multichannel WDM ring are formulated to determine the packet delay. The delay in the multichannel token ring is obtained by summing the remaining service time, token walk time, and the average service time of newly arrived messages. The remaining service time is estimated by approximating {{the system as a}} M/M/m queue. The multichannel <b>slotted</b> <b>ring</b> and buffer insertion ring are modeled by a non-preemptive head-of-the-line priority queuing system. By identifying that portion of the passing ring traffic having priority over local traffic, the delay of a tagged packet can be obtained as the sum of the residual service time and service times of local waiting packets and newly arrived ring packets.

A wide range of hierarchical structures based on the basic, dual counter-rotating, and braided (skip-a-node) rings are analyzed and compared in thispaper. We have adopted the two-processor (two-temzinal) reliability criteria for our analysis. The results of computing the system reliability for thousands of processors show that hierarchical structures constructed of counter-rotating and braided rings significantly improve the reliability of hierarchical structures constructed of basic rings. For most of the hierarchies the braided structures have better survivability andprovide higher reliability than the counter-rotating structures for long mission times. Our results show that uniform hierarchical structures tend to provide better reliability than nonuniform structures. The results are of value in designing real time systems, large-scale architectures, and general computer networks.
