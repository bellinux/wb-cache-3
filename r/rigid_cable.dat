40|$|Abstract. Unlike {{traditional}} {{assembly line}} robotic {{systems that have}} a fixed kinematic structure associated with a single tool for a structured task, nextgeneration robotic surgical assist systems {{will be required to}} use an array of endeffector tools. Once a robot is connected with a tool, the kinematic equations of motion are altered. Given the need to accommodate evolving surgical challenges and to alleviate the restrictions imposed by the confined minimally invasive environment, new surgical tools may resemble small flexible snakes rather than <b>rigid,</b> <b>cable</b> driven instruments. Connecting to these developing articulated tools will significantly alter the overall kinematic structure of a robotic system. In this paper we present a technique for real-time automated generation and evaluation of manipulator kinematic equations that exhibits the combined advantages of existing methods – speed and flexibility to kinematic change – without their disadvantages. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the dynamic behaviour of cable networks, in terms of their natural frequencies and the corresponding vibration modes. A multi-degree-of-freedom cable net model is assumed, having circular plan view and the shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid surface. The cable supports are considered either rigid or flexible, thus accounting for the deformability, of the edge ring. On the basis of numerical analyses, empirical formulae are proposed for the estimation of the linear natural frequencies, taking into account the mechanical and geometrical characteristics of the cable net and the ring, expressed in the form of appropriate non-dimensional parameters. The sequence of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes of the network and the occurrence of modal transition can be predicted in relation to one of these parameters, in analogy to single cables. The differences between a network with <b>rigid</b> <b>cable</b> supports and one with boundary ring, concerning the eigenmodes and the corresponding eigenfrequencies are identified.

40|$|A {{framework}} {{for the development of}} robust time integration schemes for nonlinear, flexible multibody systems is presented. The proposed schemes are designed to meet four specific requirements: nonlinear unconditional stability of the scheme, a rigorous treatment of both geometric and material nonlinearities, exact satisfaction of the constraints, and the presence of high frequency numerical dissipation. Specific algorithms are presented for <b>rigid</b> bodies, <b>cables,</b> beams, shells, and elasto-dynamics. The kinematic nonlinearities are treated in a rigorous manner for all elements, and the material nonlinearities can be handled when the constitutive laws stem from the existence of a strain energy density function.

50|$|Cable driven {{redundant}} parallel robots are a {{new generation}} of parallel robots in which instead of <b>rigid</b> actuators <b>cable</b> are used to produce the desired motion pattern. The fact of using cable arises a lot of challenge in analyzing the kinematics and dynamics of such a robot. Cable driven redundant parallel robots consist of a moving platform which is connected by the means of actuated cables to the base.

30|$|In {{contrast}} with classical rigid-link parallel robots, CDPRs {{are driven by}} flexible <b>cables</b> rather than <b>rigid</b> links to control the position and orientation of the EE. CDPRs exhibit advantages of parallel robots compared with serial robots including higher load–weight ratio. Moreover, CDPRs can provide many other new desirable characteristics, including high speed and acceleration, high payload-to-weight ratios, and potentially large workspace. However, different from <b>rigid</b> links, <b>cables</b> can only exert tension, namely unilateral actuating property, which limits the development and application of CDPRs. Thus, traditional methods for research on rigid-link robots can hardly applied directly in CDPRs. In order to overcome the shortcoming, research on CDPRs focus on the following aspects, including design and modelling, performance and optimization, control and planning. Owing to the development in optimal design and control theory in last decade, CDPRs have been significantly improved in terms of kinematic and dynamic performance, and increasingly applied {{to more and more}} relevant tasks, including engineer, astronomy, bionics, etc. However, CDPRs are still rarely applied industrial manufacturing in {{contrast with}} serial robots and rigid link parallel robots.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Traditionally, a {{container}} crane is modeled {{as a simple}} pendulum with either a flexible or a <b>rigid</b> hoisting <b>cable,</b> and a lumped mass {{at the end of}} the cable. However, in the case of quay-side container cranes, the actual configuration of the hoisting mechanism is significantly different it consists typically of a set of four hoisting cables. The cables are hoisted from four different points on a trolley and are attached on the load side to four points on a spreader bar used to lift containers. A controller design based on the actual model will most likely result in a response superior to those based on simple pendulum models. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model of the actual quay-side container crane. A simplified model is then used to obtain the gain and time delay for a delayed feedback controller, which will be used for the control of payload sway oscillation. Performance of the controller is simulated on a 1 / 10 th scale computer model of a 65 ton container crane using the full model. Simulation results are verified experimentally on a 1 / 10 th scale model of the same container crane. Key words: Quay-side, container crane, sway control, delayed feedback 1...|$|R

50|$|Optical fiber {{consists}} of a core and a cladding layer, selected for total internal reflection due to {{the difference in the}} refractive index between the two. In practical fibers, the cladding is usually coated with a layer of acrylate polymer or polyimide. This coating protects the fiber from damage but does not contribute to its optical waveguide properties. Individual coated fibers (or fibers formed into ribbons or bundles) then have a tough resin buffer layer and/or core tube(s) extruded around them to form the cable core. Several layers of protective sheathing, depending on the application, are added to form the <b>cable.</b> <b>Rigid</b> fiber assemblies sometimes put light-absorbing ("dark") glass between the fibers, to prevent light that leaks out of one fiber from entering another.

40|$|Background : Embolization might complicate device {{closure of}} large atrial septal defects (ASDs) with {{deficient}} margins. When margins are deficient, a precariously placed device can {{appear to be}} held in good position by the <b>rigid</b> delivery <b>cable.</b> Once the cable is unscrewed, the device adopts the natural lie of the interatrial septum. This can occasionally expose the inadequately captured margins and lead to device embolization. Most embolizations occur immediately after release. Retrieval of the embolized device required prolonged fluoroscopy and sometimes open heart surgery. Objective : To evolve a new strategy of retrieval of a malpositioned device after unscrewing the cable before impending embolization. Materials and Methods : After deploying the device in place, a snare is passed through the delivery sheath around the cable to grip the screw on the right atrial disc of the device. With the snare holding the screw end, the device is released by unscrewing the cable. The device position is reconfirmed on echocardiography. The snare is subsequently removed if the device was stable. In case of device migration, the same snare is used to retrieve the device before it embolizes completely. Results : Snare assistance was used in 24 patients considered as high-risk for device embolization. Its usefulness was demonstrated in two patients with deficient posterior margin and small inferior margin where the device got malpositioned immediately after release. As the snare was still holding on to the screw end, the device could be retrieved into the sheath easily. Conclusion : This novel snare assisted device release strategy safeguards against device embolization in large ASDs with deficient rims and allows simplified retrieval...|$|R
40|$|Freezing of gait is an episodic gait disorder,characterized by the {{inability}} to generate effective forward stepping movements. The pathophysiology underlying freezing of gait remains insufficiently understood, and this hampers the development of better treatment strategies. Preliminary evidence suggests that impaired force control during walking may contribute to freezing episodes, with difficulty to unload the swing leg and initiate the swing phase. Here, we used external loading to manipulate force control and to investigate its influence on freezing of gait. Twelve Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait performed three contrasting tasks: (1) loaded gait while wearing a belt fortified with lead weights; (2) weight supported gait using a parachute harness connected to a <b>rigid</b> metal <b>cable</b> running above the gait trajectory; and (3) normal gait. Gait tasks were used to provoke freezing episodes, including rapid 360 ° turns. Freezing episodes were quantified using blinded, videotaped clinical assessment. Furthermore, ground reaction forces and body kinematics were recorded. Loading significantly increased {{the mean number of}} freezing episodes per trial compared to the normal gait condition (P< 0. 05), but the effect of weight support was not consistent. Loading particularly increased the number of freezing episodes during rapid short steps. Step length was significantly smaller during loaded gait compared to normal gait (P< 0. 05), but changes in anticipatory postural adjustments were not different. Our results may point to impaired force control playing a key role in freezing of gait. Future studies should further investigate the mechanism, i. e., the contribution of deficient load feedback, and evaluate which forms of weight support might offer treatment opportunities. status: publishe...|$|R

The system will incorporate a commercial precision component analyzer and a two probe sample apparatus to perform electrical impedance spectroscopy. Two probes interface the soil-water sample through the bottom of a sealed sample container. The impedance analyzer applies 1 VAC across the electrodes over a range of frequencies.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 -D) helical reconstructions {{computed}} from electron micrographs of negatively stained dispersed F-actin filaments invariably revealed two uninterrupted columns of mass forming the "backbone" of the double-helical filament. The contact between neighboring subunits along the thus defined two long-pitch helical strands was spatially conserved and of high mass density, while the intersubunit contact {{between them was}} of lower mass density and varied among reconstructions. In contrast, phalloidinstabilized F-actin filaments displayed higher and spatially more conserved mass density between the two long-pitch helical strands, suggesting that this bicyclic hepta-peptide toxin strengthens the intersubunit contact between the two strands. Consistent with this distinct intersubunit bonding pattern, the two long-pitch helical strands of unstabilized filaments were sometimes observed separated from each other over a distance of two to six subunits, suggesting that the intrastrand intersubunit contact is also physically stronger than the interstrand contact. The resolution of the filament reconstructions, extending to 2. 5 nm axially and radially, enabled us to reproducibly "cut out" the F- actin subunit which measured 5. 5 nm axially by 6. 0 nm tangentially by 3. 2 nm radially. The subunit is distinctly polar with a massive "base" pointing towards the "barbed" end of the filament, and a slender "tip" defining its "pointed" end (i. e., relative to the "arrowhead" pattern revealed after stoichiometric decoration of the filaments with myosin subfragment 1). Concavities running approximately parallel to the filament axis both on {{the inner and outer}} face of the subunit define a distinct cleft separating the subunit into two domains of similar size: an inner domain confined to radii {{less than or equal to}} 2. 5 -nm forms the uninterrupted backbone of the two long-pitch helical strands, and an outer domain placed at radii of 2 - 5 -nm protrudes radially and thus predominantly contributes to the outer part of the massive base. Quantitative evaluation of successive crossover spacings along individual F-actin filaments revealed the deviations from the mean repeat to be compensatory, i. e., short crossovers frequently followed long ones and vice versa. The variable crossover spacings and diameter of the F-actin filament together with the local unraveling of the two long-pitch helical strands are explained in terms of varying amounts of compensatory "lateral slipping" of the two strands past each other roughly perpendicular to the filament axis. This intrinsic disorder of the actin filament may enable the actin moiety to play a more active role in actin-myosin-based force generation than merely act as a <b>rigid</b> passive <b>cable</b> as has hitherto been assumed...|$|R
