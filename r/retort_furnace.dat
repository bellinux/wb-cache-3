The retort is generally sealed with either a gasket or is welded shut and filled completely with the desired atmosphere and then heated externally by conventional heating elements.

Most studies to date have used very small amounts of finely ground biomass. This study reports the testing of a crucible <b>furnace</b> <b>retort</b> that was fabricated to produce intermediate quantities of torrefied material and to allow processing of wood chips. Yields ranging from 51 to 96 % were impacted {{to a greater extent}} by differences in temperature than time of treatment.

5000|$|The {{process begins}} with a {{downdraft}} sintering operation. The sinter, which {{is a mixture of}} roaster calcine and EAF calcine, is loaded onto a gate type conveyor and then combustions gases are pumped through the sinter. The carbon in the combustion gases react with some the impurities, such as lead, cadmium, and halides. These impurities are driven off into filtration bags. The sinter after this process, called product sinter, usually has a composition of 48% zinc, 8% iron, 5% aluminium, 4% silicon, 2.5% calcium, and smaller quantities of magnesium, lead, and other metals. The sinter product is then charged with coke into an electric <b>retort</b> <b>furnace.</b> A pair of graphite electrodes from the top and bottom furnace produce current flow through the mixture.

40|$|This article {{reports a}} new moving bed with {{particularly}} designed side and central channels as its internals for small-size oil shale pyrolysis by solid heat carrier. The bed is called moving bed with internals (MBI), and the solid heat carrier is shale ash from industrial Fushun <b>retorting</b> <b>furnace.</b> The pyrolysis was tested by varying {{the temperature of}} solid heat carrier, thickness of particle bed between the side and central channels, and ash-to-shale mass blending ratio {{in terms of the}} oil and gas product distribution and qualities. The shale oil yield is close to 90 % of the Fischer Assay yield, and of the produced oil over 70 wt. % is gasoline and diesel and its dust content is only about 0. 1 wt. %. The highest shale oil yield occurs at the pyrolysis temperature of 495 degrees C. The shale oil yield decreases with increasing particle bed thickness due to the increased shale oil cracking over shale ash in the prolonged residence time of volatile products inside the particle bed. Mechanism analysis shows that the central channel in the MBI directs the pyrolysis products to flow from the annulus to center of the particle bed, and this makes the moving bed as a filtration layer that considerably reduces the dust content in the produced oil. Meanwhile, this lateral flow greatly shortens the time of secondary reactions occurring to the pyrolysis products so that MBI could be applied to small-size oil shale to produce shale oil with high yield and high quality.

Tests were performed in laboratory conditions on a water boiler with <b>retort</b> <b>furnace</b> and the capacity of 10 kW. Fuels from sewage sludge and agriculture wastes (PBZ fuel) and a blend of coal with laying hens mature (CLHM) were taken into account. The results in emission changes of NOx, CO 2, CO and SO 2 and operating parameters of the tested boiler during combustion were investigated. The obtained results were compared with corresponding results of flame coal (GFC). Combustion of the PBZ fuel {{turned out to be}} a stable process in the tested boiler but the thermal output has decreased in about 30 % compared to coal combustion, while CO and NOx emission has increased. Similar effect was observed when 15 % of the poultry litter was added to the coal. In this case thermal output has also decreased (in about 20 %) and increase of CO and NOx emission was observed. As a conclusion, it can be stated that more effective control system with an adaptive air regulation and a modified heat exchanger could be useful in order to achieve the nominal power of the tested boiler...|$|E

The dipole fields of up to 12. 1 T at nominal current require the use of high-critical-current Nb_ 3 Sn strand for the fabrication of the coils. These coils will be up to 8 m long and represent the longest Nb_ 3 Sn coils so far fabricated for operation accelerator magnets.

40|$|The Black Butte mercury mine near Cottage Grove, Oregon has {{recently}} {{been added to the}} Federal Clean Up List (2010). Water samples were collected from streams within the site and analysed for trace metals. Water samples were separated in the field into As(III) and As(IV) species for subsequent measurement using ICP-MS. Tailing piles on the mine site originating from the <b>retort</b> <b>furnace</b> contain cinnabar (HgS) up to 20 mg kg- 1, as measured using XRF, which has previously been established as the source of mercury polluting the adjacent Coast Fork Willamette River and Cottage Grove reservoir. Mercury methylation is largely confined to lake sediments with fish consumption advisories in effect. The andesitic lavas hosting the mercury ores at Black Butte are naturally elevated in arsenic, with groundwater from wells in the region reported above the EPA MCL level of 10 μg L- 1. Arsenic levels in streams within the study area ranged from 0. 3 – 9. 6 μg L- 1. The highest levels were found in water flowing from the main mine adit. Over 80 % of soluble arsenic {{is in the form of}} As(III), rather than As(V); this reflects the greater mobility of As(III) species.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a concept to utilise Carbon-dioxide for Steel-Making {{and would like}} to name it after the first author as OSRAM-CO$_ 2 $-SM process. We found in our lab {{experiments}} that the carbon content in high-carbon ferro-chrome metallic powders has come down from 7 % to 1 % when pure CO$_ 2 $ gas with partial pressure of 1 atmosphere is passed through a horizontal <b>retort</b> <b>furnace</b> maintained at 1100 $^o$ C for 24 hours. Our results clearly demonstrated that decarburisation can be very effective, when CO$_ 2 $ is used at temperatures where it is unstable and the Boudouard reaction which is endothermic in nature is more favoured. Based on these findings, we propose the OSRAM-CO$_ 2 $-SM process in which CO$_ 2 $ shall be used as the decarburising agent. CO$_ 2 $ is to be passed into a specially designed converter provided with heating mechanism to maintain the contents from blast furnace in a molten state for decarburisation of the melt. The out coming hot gases consisting of CO has to be burnt in a combustion chamber with stochiometric proportions of pure O$_ 2 $ to produce CO$_ 2 $ at a partial pressure close to 1 atm. The process will be extremely useful as it involves reuse and recycle of CO$_ 2 $ and in turn would reduce the overall amount of CO$_ 2 $ discharged into the atmosphere.

40|$|Ilmenite is an {{important}} raw material for titanium-containing products. Currently, it is processed using large amounts of coal but this could be substituted with natural gas. This could potentially increase the efficiency and lower CO 2 emissions of the process. Technology from direct reduced iron (DRI) processes which use natural gas could be adapted for ilmenite reduction. In some DRI processes natural gas is reformed to a mixture of CO and H 2, so-called synthesis gas, or syngas. This work investigates the factors which influence the reduction rate and final products of ilmenite reduction with syngas. Previous work focuses mainly on pure CO or pure H 2 gases, rarely mixtures of the two. Therefore, the previous models were based only on the single gases. These models should be extended to mixtures of CO and H 2. The effects of the water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) could then be modelled. The influence of impurities, especially Mg, should also {{be included in the}} model since previous studies indicate that this could change the reduction rate. The aim of the present work is to determine which factors are most important for reduction of ilmenite in synthesis gas and then develop a model which can be used to understand the kinetics of the reactions. Pellets of preoxidised ilmenite concentrates were reduced in batches of 200 g in a vertical <b>retort</b> <b>furnace.</b> The mass loss of each experiment was measured as a function of time to show the reaction progress. The gas composition, temperature and ore source were the main variables which were investigated. The final products were analysed for chemical and phase composition. Microanalysis was also done with an optical microscope, a scanning electron microscope and an electron probe microanalyser. From experimental work, it was found that reduction has two stages the first is very fast and the second is noticeably slower. These stages correspond to reduction from Fe 3 + to Fe 2 + and Fe 2 + to metallic iron. Low temperature and low H 2 content in the gas results in slower reaction rates. However, investigations at low temperatures are affected by carbon precipitation in the crucible. This occurs to some degree at 880 ◦C but not at 1000 ◦C. Under strongly reducing conditions, there is some degree of titanium reduction in addition to iron reduction. When 8...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of Mg as main impurity in ilmenite during gaseous reduction with CO and H 2 gas was studied in this work. This {{is of interest}} for the ilmenite pre-reduction step in the Tyssedal Process as where the impurities in ilmenite tend to give impact to the reduction rate. The work comprises an experimental investigation of synthetic Mg-rich ilmenite pellets with their conversion (reduction) degree, which {{have been used to}} isolate the {{influence of}} Mg in ilmenite pre-reduction. Producing synthetic Mg-rich ilmenite, where the target compound is FeTiO 3 -MgTiO 3 (M 2 O 3) solid solution, was the initial task. Synthetic Mg-rich ilmenite ores with different amount of Mg were made by using a CCIF (Cold Crucible Induction furnace) in an inert atmosphere. The slow cooling method used for the synthesis proved the possible production of the FeTiO 3 -MgTiO 3 solid solution without other phases. The XRD analysis showed confirmation of only FeTiO 3 -MgTiO 3 peaks. Then, the oxidation of synthetic Mg-rich ilmenite was done after pelletizing. Synthetic Mg-rich ilmenite pellets were oxidized in a muffle furnace at the temperature of 1000 ℃ for 2 hours. The resulted phases after oxidation were ferric pseudobrookite (Fe 23 +TiO 5), rutile (TiO 2), magnesium dititanate (MgTi 2 O 5) as expected but also an addition of hematite (Fe 2 O 3). The Mg in ilmenite was thought to hinder the pseudobrookite formation of ilmenite by forming magnesium dititanate ahead in reaction. The reduction of synthetic Mg-rich ilmenite pellets was done with different ratio of CO and H 2 gas for 4 hours. The TGA (Thermo-Gravimetric Analyzer) vertical <b>retort</b> <b>furnace</b> was used, and the mass loss of each sample was recorded and further calculated into conversion degree. Synthetic Mg-rich ilmenite pellet samples with different amount of Mg were reduced with 50 % CO + 50 % H 2 gas, and they showed lower conversion degree with increasing amount of Mg in ilmenite. Synthetic Mg-rich ilmenite pellets with same amount of Mg were reduced with different amount of H 2 gas in the gas mixture, and they showed higher conversion degree with increasing amount of H 2 gas. The comparison of conversion degrees of each sample showed two clear indications: Mg in ilmenite hinders the reduction rate, whereas H 2 gas enhances the reduction rate. 	 In addition, the conversion degree for the sample reduced with only H 2 gas was approximately 1. 18 after 4 hours, which indicated addition mass from the supposedly inert rutile (TiO 2). Instead of finding phases of reduced rutile however, only phases of Mg, Ti oxide species were detected. It was thought that Mg in ilmenite diffuses ahead and immediately stabilizes the reduced rutile species by forming Mg, Ti oxide species. From the experiment of synthetic Mg-rich ilmenite pellets, a clear indication for the influence of Mg in ilmenite reduction was given. The data observed from the relatively pure synthetic ilmenite pellets are believed to give accurate results compared to natural ilmenite pellets...|$|E
