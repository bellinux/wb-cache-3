5|$|Although the {{structures}} of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by both genes are essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the single strand DNA and directly interacts with the <b>recombinase</b> RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double strand breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form of {{chromosomal}} crossover is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the <b>recombinase</b> then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.|$|E

25|$|SulA/FtsZ {{mediated}} filamentation: This is {{a mechanism}} to halt cell division and repair DNA. In the presence of single-stranded DNA regions, due to the action of different external cues (that induce mutations), the major bacterial <b>recombinase</b> (RecA) binds to this DNA regions and is activated {{by the presence of}} free nucleotide triphosphates. This activated RecA stimulates the autoproteolysis of the SOS transcriptional repressor LexA. The LexA regulon includes a cell division inhibitor, SulA, that prevent the transmission of mutant DNA to the daughter cells. SulA is a dimer that binds FtsZ (a tubulin-like GTPase) in a 1:1 ratio and acts specifically on its polymerization which results in the formation of non-septated bacteria filaments. A similar mechanism may occur in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,which also elongates after being phagocytized.|$|E

The structure of the catalytic domain, consisting of ten α helices and a three-strand β sheet, resembles the catalytic domains of site-specific <b>recombinases</b> that act via a topoisomerase IB-like mechanism. The topoisomerase catalytic pentad is conserved in the tertiary structures of the <b>recombinases</b> despite scant sequence similarity overall.

This group of proteins exhibits an unexpectedly large diversity of sequences. Despite this diversity, all of the <b>recombinases</b> can be aligned in their C-terminal halves. A 40 -residue region near the C terminus is particularly well conserved in all the proteins and is homologous to a region near the C terminus of the yeast 2 mu plasmid Flp protein. This family of <b>recombinases</b> {{does not appear to be}} related to any other site-specific <b>recombinases.</b> Three positions are perfectly conserved within this family: histidine, arginine and tyrosine are found at respective alignment positions 396, 399 and 433 within the well-conserved C-terminal region. We speculate that these residues contribute to the active site of this family of <b>recombinases,</b> and suggest that tyrosine- 433 forms a transient covalent linkage to DNA during strand cleavage and rejoining...|$|R

Two dedicated <b>recombinases,</b> RipX and CodV, catalyze {{the resolution of}} dimers by site-specific recombination at the dif site, which is located close to the terminus region on the chromosome. We show that the two DNA translocases in B. subtilis, SftA and SpoIIIE, synergistically affect dimer resolution, presumably by positioning the dif sites in close proximity, before or after completion of cell division, respectively. Furthermore, we observed that both <b>recombinases,</b> RipX and CodV, assemble on the chromosome at the dif site throughout the cell cycle. The preassembly of <b>recombinases</b> probably ensures that dimer resolution can occur rapidly {{within a short time}} window around cell division...|$|R
25|$|Over the years, the hypercycle {{theory has}} {{experienced}} many reformulations and methodological approaches. Among them, {{the most notable}} are applications of partial differential equations, cellular automata, and stochastic formulations of Eigen's problem. Despite many advantages {{that the concept of}} hypercycles presents, there were also some problems regarding the traditional model formulation using ODEs: a vulnerability to parasites and a limited size of stable hypercycles. In 2012, the first experimental proof for the emergence of a cooperative network among fragments of self-assembling ribozymes was published, demonstrating their advantages over self-replicating cycles. However, even though this experiment proves the existence of cooperation among the <b>recombinase</b> ribozyme subnetworks, this cooperative network does not form a hypercycle per se, so we still lack the experimental demonstration of hypercycles.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{dimerized}} λ gam binds to {{the host}} RecBCD and SbcCD nucleases, inhibiting all of their known activities, which prevents degradation of the linear foreign DNA. λ exo binds to double stranded linear transformed DNA and processively degrades it in a 5’ to 3’ direction. Exo is a globular, trimeric protein that forms a ring shape with a hollow center that positions the linear DNA for cleavage. One side of the ring {{is large enough to}} admit double stranded DNA, but the other end can only accommodate single stranded DNA, therefore providing details into the exo mechanism of action. This process results in single stranded 3’ overhangs on the linear DNA. Subsequently, λ beta, a member of a <b>recombinase</b> family, binds to the 3’ overhangs and mediates annealing to the complementary E. coli DNA. This process occurs through invasion of the single stranded 3’ overhang into the complementary target DNA on the lagging strand during DNA synthesis, allowing beta-facilitated annealing.|$|E
25|$|Mitochondrial DNA is {{susceptible}} to damage from free oxygen radicals from mistakes that occur during the production of ATP through the electron transport chain. These mistakes {{can be caused by}} genetic disorders, cancer, and temperature variations. These radicals can damage mtDNA molecules or change them, making it hard for mitochondrial polymerase to replicate them. Both cases can lead to deletions, rearrangements, and other mutations. Recent evidence has suggested that mitochondria have enzymes that proofread mtDNA and fix mutations that may occur due to free radicals. It is believed that a DNA <b>recombinase</b> found in mammalian cells is also involved in a repairing recombination process. Deletions and mutations due to free radicals have been associated with the aging process. It is believed that radicals cause mutations which lead to mutant proteins, which in turn led to more radicals. This process takes many years and is associated with some aging processes involved in oxygen-dependent tissues such as brain, heart, muscle, and kidney. Auto-enhancing processes such as these are possible causes of degenerative diseases including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and coronary artery disease.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the basic}} {{chemical}} reaction {{is the same}} for both tyrosine and serine <b>recombinases,</b> there are marked differences. Tyrosine <b>recombinases,</b> such as Cre or Flp, cleave one DNA strand at a time at points that are staggered by 6-8bp, linking the 3’ end of the strand to the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine nucleophile (Fig. 1). Strand exchange then proceeds via a crossed strand intermediate analogous to the Holliday junction in which only one pair of strands has been exchanged.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMost {{site-specific}} <b>recombinases</b> can {{be grouped}} into two mechanistically distinct families. Whereas tyrosine <b>recombinases</b> exchange DNA strands through a Holliday intermediate, serine <b>recombinases</b> such as Hin generate double-strand breaks in each recombining partner. Here, site-directed protein crosslinking {{is used to}} elucidate the configuration of protein subunits and DNA within the Hin synaptic complex and to follow the movement of protein subunits during DNA strand exchange. Our {{results show that the}} protein interface mediating synapsis is localized to a region within the catalytic domains, thereby positioning the DNA strands {{on the outside of the}} Hin tetrameric complex. Unexpected crosslinks between residues within the dimerization helices provide evidence for a conformational change that accompanies DNA cleavage. We demonstrate that the Hin subunits, which are linked to the cleaved DNA ends by serine-phosphodiester bonds, translocate between synapsed dimers to exchange the DNA strands...|$|R
40|$|A simple, {{effective}} method of unlabeled, stable gene insertion into bacterial chromosomes has been developed. This utilizes an insertion cassette consisting of an antibiotic resistance gene flanked by dif sites and regions homologous to the chromosomal target locus. dif is the recognition sequence for the native Xer site-specific <b>recombinases</b> responsible for chromosome and plasmid dimer resolution: XerC/XerD in Escherichia coli and RipX/CodV in Bacillus subtilis. Following {{integration of the}} insertion cassette into the chromosomal target locus by homologous recombination, these <b>recombinases</b> act to resolve the two directly repeated dif sites to a single site, thus excising the antibiotic resistance gene. Previous approaches have required the inclusion of exogenous site-specific <b>recombinases</b> or transposases in trans; our strategy demonstrates that this is unnecessary, since an effective recombination system is already present in bacteria.

25|$|If, as {{evidence}} indicates, sexual reproduction arose {{very early in}} eukaryotic evolution, the essential features of meiosis may have already been present in the prokaryotic ancestors of eukaryotes. In extant organisms, proteins with central functions in meiosis are similar to key proteins in bacterial transformation. For example, recA <b>recombinase,</b> that catalyses the key functions of DNA homology search and strand exchange in the bacterial sexual process of transformation, has orthologs in eukaryotes that perform similar functions in meiotic recombination (see Wikipedia articles RecA, RAD51 and DMC1). Both bacterial transformation and meiosis in eukaryotic microorganisms are induced by stressful circumstances such as overcrowding, resource depletion and DNA damaging conditions. This suggests that these sexual processes are adaptations for dealing with stress, particularly stress that causes DNA damage. In bacteria, these stresses induce an altered physiologic state, termed competence, that allows active take-up of DNA from a donor bacterium and the integration of this DNA into the recipient genome (see Natural competence) allowing recombinational repair of the recipients’ damaged DNA. If environmental stresses leading to DNA damage were a persistent challenge {{to the survival of}} early microorganisms, then selection would likely have been continuous through the prokaryote to eukaryote transition, and adaptative adjustments would have followed a course in which bacterial transformation naturally gave rise to sexual reproduction in eukaryotes.|$|E
500|$|The {{proteins}} of the RecA <b>recombinase</b> {{family of}} proteins {{are thought to}} be descended from a common ancestral <b>recombinase.</b> The RecA <b>recombinase</b> family contains RecA protein from bacteria, the Rad51 and Dmc1 proteins from eukaryotes, and RadA from archaea, and the <b>recombinase</b> paralog proteins. Studies modeling the evolutionary relationships between the Rad51, Dmc1 and RadA proteins indicate that they are monophyletic, or that they share a common molecular ancestor. [...] Within this protein family, Rad51 and Dmc1 are grouped together in a separate clade from RadA. One of the reasons for grouping these three proteins together is that they all possess a modified helix-turn-helix [...] motif, which helps the proteins bind to DNA, toward their N-terminal ends. [...] An ancient gene duplication event of a eukaryotic RecA gene and subsequent mutation has been proposed as a likely origin of the modern [...] RAD51 and DMC1 genes.|$|E
500|$|DMC1 (DNA meiotic <b>recombinase</b> 1) is a meiosis {{specific}} homolog of RAD51 that mediates strand exchange during homologous recombinational repair. [...] DMC1 {{promotes the}} formation of DNA strand invasion products (joint molecules) between homologous DNA molecules. [...] Human DMC1 interacts directly with each {{of a series of}} repeat sequences in the BRCA2 protein (called BRC repeats) that stimulate joint molecule formation by DMC1. [...] BRC repeats conform to a motif consisting of a sequence of about 35 highly conserved amino acids that are present at least once in all BRCA2-like proteins. [...] The BRCA2 BRC repeats stimulate joint molecule formation by promoting the interaction of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with DMC1. [...] The ssDNA complexed with DMC1 can pair with homologous ssDNA from another chromosome during the synapsis stage of meiosis to form a joint molecule, a central step in homologous recombination. Thus the BRC repeat sequences of BRCA2 appear to {{play a key role in}} recombinational repair of DNA damages during meiotic recombination.|$|E
40|$|Background The transposases encoded by the IS 607 {{family of}} mobile {{elements}} are unusual serine <b>recombinases</b> with an inverted domain order and minimal specificity for target DNA. Results Structural genomics groups have determined three crystal {{structures of the}} catalytic domains of IS 607 family transposases.

Conclusions Based on these structures, we propose a model for how IS 607 -family transposases could form a synaptic tetramer. The model suggests that, unlike other serine <b>recombinases,</b> these enzymes carry out sequence-specific DNA binding and catalysis in trans: the DNA binding and catalytic domains of each subunit are proposed to interact with different DNA duplexes.

2500|$|Conditional {{mutation}} is a mutation {{that has}} wild-type (or less severe) phenotype under certain [...] "permissive" [...] environmental conditions and a mutant phenotype under certain [...] "restrictive" [...] conditions. For example, a temperature-sensitive mutation can cause cell death at high temperature (restrictive condition), but might have no deleterious consequences {{at a lower}} temperature (permissive condition). These mutations are non-autonomous, as their manifestation depends upon presence of certain conditions, as opposed to other mutations which appear autonomously. The permissive conditions may be temperature, certain chemicals, light or mutations {{in other parts of}} the genome. In vivo mechanisms like transcriptional switches can create conditional mutations. For instance, association of Steroid Binding Domain can create a transcriptional switch that can change the expression of a gene based on the presence of a steroid ligand. Conditional mutations have applications in research as they allow control over gene expression. This is especially useful studying diseases in adults by allowing expression after a certain period of growth, thus eliminating the deleterious effect of gene expression seen during stages of development in model organisms. DNA <b>Recombinase</b> systems like Cre-Lox Recombination used in association with promoters that are activated under certain conditions can generate conditional mutations. Dual <b>Recombinase</b> technology can be used to induce multiple conditional mutations to study the diseases which manifest as a result of simultaneous mutations in multiple genes. Certain inteins have been identified which splice only at certain permissive temperatures, leading to improper protein synthesis and thus, loss of function mutations at other temperatures. Conditional mutations may also be used in genetic studies associated with ageing, as the expression can be changed after a certain time period in the organism's lifespan.|$|E
2500|$|... 2) Irreversible {{adaptation}} to sperm competition. [...] It {{has been suggested}} that the ancestor of the boreoeutherian mammals was a small mammal that required very large testes (perhaps rather like those of a hamster) for sperm competition and thus had to place its testes outside the body. This led to enzymes involved in spermatogenesis, spermatogenic DNA polymerase beta and <b>recombinase</b> activities evolving a unique temperature optimum, slightly less than core body temperature. When the boreoeutherian mammals then diversified into forms that were larger and/or did not require intense sperm competition they still produced enzymes that operated best at cooler temperatures and had to keep their testes outside the body. This position is made less parsimonious {{by the fact that the}} kangaroo, a non-boreoeutherian mammal, has external testicles. The ancestors of kangaroos might, separately from boreotherian mammals, have also been subject to heavy sperm competition and thus developed external testes, however, kangaroo external testes are suggestive of a possible adaptive function for external testes in large animals.|$|E

[...] B cells produce antibodies that are secreted into the bloodstream and T cells produce receptors that once translated are transported to the outer lipid bilayer of the cell. [...] Antibodies are composed of two light and two heavy chains. [...] The antigen binding site consists of two variable regions, VL and VH. [...] The remainder of the antibody structure {{is made up of}} constant regions, CL, CH, CH2 and CH3. [...] The Kappa locus in the mouse encodes an antibody light chain and contains approximately 300 gene segments for the variable region, V, four J segments than encode a short protein region, and one constant, C, segment. [...] To produce a light chain with one unique type of VL, when B cells are differentiating, DNA is rearranged to incorporate a unique combination of the V and J segments. [...] RNA splicing joins the recombined region with the C segment. [...] The heavy chain gene also contain numerous diversity segments, D, and multiple constant segments, Cμ, Cδ, Cγ, Cε, Cα. [...] Recombination occurs in a specific region of the gene that is located between two conserved sequence motifs called recombination signal sequences. [...] Each motif is flanked by a 7 bp and 9 bp sequence that is separated by a 12 bp spacer, referred to as class 1, or a 23 bp spacer, referred to as class 2. [...] A <b>recombinase</b> made up of RAG1 and RAG2 subunits always cleave between these two sites. [...] The cleavage results in two hairpin structures for the V and J segments, respectively, and the non-coding region, are now separated from the V and J segments by a DSB. [...] The hairpin coding region goes through the process of NHEJ where the closed end is cleaved and repaired. [...] The non-coding region is circularized and degraded.

With some notable exceptions, unconserved regions correspond to loops in the crystal structures of the catalytic domains of lambda Int (Int c 170) and HP 1 Int (HPC) and of the <b>recombinases</b> XerD and Cre. Two structured regions also harbor some pronounced differences. The first comprises beta-sheets 4 and 5, alpha-helix D and the adjacent loop connecting it to alpha-helix E: two Ints of phages infecting thermophilic bacteria are missing this region altogether; the crystal structures of HPC, XerD and Cre reveal a lack of beta-sheets 4 and 5; Cre displays two additional beta-sheets following alpha-helix D; five <b>recombinases</b> carry large insertions.
