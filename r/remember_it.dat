5|$|The game {{received}} a mixed reception from critics. Author John Sellers listed {{it among the}} weirder arcade games released. Clare Edgeley of Computer and Video Games echoed similar statements. She criticized the game, stating that the constant blue background was dull and the game lacked longevity. Retro Gamers Darran Jones described the game as engrossing and obscure. He also expressed disappointment that few people <b>remember</b> <b>it.</b> Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame called Bubbles a slightly underrated game. He stated that while it lacked excitement, its gameplay was enjoyable. Weiss further commented that the control scheme was unique for its time, and {{that the number of}} on-screen objects moving smoothly was impressive.|$|E
5|$|After the rescue, onlookers applaud Hancock for his {{handling}} of the bank robbery. The superhero becomes popular again, as Ray had predicted. He goes out to dinner with Ray and Mary, with whom he reveals his apparent immortality and his amnesia stemming from an incident some 80 years prior and Ray reveals that Mary isn't Aaron's mother, who died after giving birth. After Hancock tucks a drunken Ray in bed, Hancock approaches and kisses Mary. At first, she responds passionately, but then turns angry, throwing Hancock through a wall and into the street. Hancock departs, confused at having apparently found another like himself. The next morning, Hancock arrives back at the house to demand answers from Mary. She warns him to stay away from her and her family but agrees to meet Hancock at his home to answer his questions. When she arrives, Hancock discovers that Mary also has superpowers and is apparently immortal. He threatens to expose her unless she explains their origins so she tells him that they are the last two members of a race that have lived for 3,000 years with their powers. Mary claims that they are brother and sister, which Hancock dismisses, given the nature of the previous night's kiss. Hancock realizes that Mary is not being entirely truthful and he departs to tell Ray about her. Their interaction results in a battle between Hancock and Mary that takes them to downtown Los Angeles, causing significant damage to the area. Ray, downtown in a business meeting, sees and recognizes Mary using superhero powers similar to those of Hancock. Ray departs his meeting and arrives home {{just in time to see}} Mary land in the backyard, followed closely by Hancock. She then reveals that, although he doesn't <b>remember</b> <b>it,</b> Hancock is her husband. The three then quietly go their separate ways.|$|E

25|$|Though sources often cite Sakuraba's {{match with}} Kimo Leopoldo on July 14, 1996 {{as his first}} {{experience}} with mixed martial arts, there is debate about {{whether it was a}} shoot or a worked match. Sakuraba himself has stated that he doesn't <b>remember</b> <b>it.</b> However, his first contact with MMA can be traced to his different style fight at 26 June 1996 against Dutch kickboxer Rene Rooze, which was won by Sakuraba via ankle hold.|$|E
25|$|Many {{forms of}} amnesia fix {{themselves}} without being treated. However, {{there are a}} few ways to cope with memory loss if that is not the case. One of these ways is cognitive or occupational therapy. In therapy, amnesiacs will develop the memory skills they have and try to regain some they have lost by finding which techniques help retrieve memories or create new retrieval paths. This may also include strategies for organizing information to <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> more easily and for improving understanding of lengthy conversation.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, {{cyberpunk}} authors like William Gibson {{turned away}} from the optimism and support for progress of traditional science fiction. This dystopian vision of the near future is described in the work of Philip K. Dick, such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and We Can <b>Remember</b> <b>It</b> for You Wholesale, which resulted in the films Blade Runner and Total Recall. The Star Wars franchise helped spark a new interest in space opera. C. J. Cherryh's detailed explorations of alien life and complex scientific challenges influenced a generation of writers.|$|E
25|$|Russert {{does not}} recall stating to Libby, in this conversation, {{anything}} about the wife of former ambassador Joe Wilson. Although he could not completely {{rule out the possibility}} that he had such an exchange, Russert was at a loss to <b>remember</b> <b>it,</b> and moreover, he believes that this would be the type of conversation that he would or should remember. Russert acknowledged that he speaks to many people on a daily basis and it is difficult to reconstruct some specific conversations, particularly one which occurred several months ago.|$|E
25|$|Later {{investigation}} found {{that someone had}} called Lieberman's cell phone from the apartment at 4 a.m. Lieberman does not <b>remember</b> <b>it,</b> but thinks he may have awoken briefly to check his voicemail. When he got up for work at 6:30, his wife had still not returned. That evening, after the terrorist attacks, {{he was able to}} use his medical credentials to get through the security perimeter and return to their apartment. Since the window had been left open, dust from the towers had accumulated throughout. There were tracks in it from the couple's two kittens, but none from any human.|$|E

25|$|Screamers {{was stuck}} in {{development}} hell {{for over a decade}} before finally being produced. Screenwriter Dan O'Bannon had completed his adaptation of Dick's short story Second Variety in the early 1980s (along with his adaptation of another of Dick's short stories, We Can <b>Remember</b> <b>It</b> For You Wholesale, which became the 1990 film Total Recall). By 1983, O'Bannon's screenplay for Screamers had been optioned by Tom Naud (SFX designer on the 1981 film Outland). However, the production never went ahead as planned and {{it was not until the}} 1990s that Screamers went into production, by which time the screenplay had been rewritten by Miguel Tejada-Flores. The film, directed by Christian Duguay, was made in Canada. Locations included a quarry in Quebec, in Montreal's Olympic Stadium, as well as Joliette.|$|E
25|$|Marlena {{joins the}} hunt for the reasons behind the Brady/DiMera feud, while keeping John on life support. John then comes out of his coma, and helps Marlena and the others on their quest. John is hit by a car, and {{seemingly}} dies on October 17, 2007. As is often the case in Salem, characters rarely die. On January 8, 2008, EJ discovers John {{in the basement of the}} DiMera mansion, being programmed by Stefano to become a super soldier. After he is discovered by the police, John wakes up with amnesia, and Marlena struggles to help John <b>remember.</b> <b>It</b> is discovered that John is the child of Shawn Brady's sister Colleen, and Stefano's father, Santo DiMera. Their affair and its disastrous ending was the beginning of the feud. John's obesession with his DiMera heritage and his changed personality both start to take a toll on Marlena, and she finds it hard to stay with John. Stefano wakes up from a coma (after Marlena purposely sends him into a comatose state in January 2008), and intends on getting revenge on Marlena and taking the DiMera empire back from John. He causes Marlena to fall into a coma the exact way she did to him. However, Marlena wakes up after receiving a ghostly visit from her late sister, Samantha. John relinquishes his control of the empire to Stefano, but Marlena, by then, decides to move on with her life and files for divorce.|$|E
