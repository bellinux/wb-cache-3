40|$|This paper {{describes}} a distributed virtual environment application that combines robotics in both virtual and <b>real</b> <b>worlds.</b> The motivation for this system comes from research in {{virtual and augmented}} reality, autonomous robotics and computer vision. The system combines graphical immersive environments with the live video from a robot working in a <b>real</b> environment. The <b>worlds</b> are synchronized and updated based on both the operator selections, commands and robot actions. This system allows the user to have a powerful tool to create and control autonomous robots, thus making possible the realization of single and multiple autonomous robot applications. Keywords: virtual environments, distributed synthetic worlds, immersive environments, augmented reality, autonomous robotics, computer vision, teleoperation, handicap assistance. 1 Introduction In this paper we describe our current work with an application of distributed virtual worlds that combines robotics in both virtual and <b>real</b> <b>worlds</b> [...] ...|$|R
5|$|During a LARP, player {{actions in}} the <b>real</b> <b>world</b> {{represent}} character actions in an imaginary setting. Game rules, physical symbols and theatrical improvisation are used to bridge differences between the <b>real</b> <b>world</b> and the setting. For example, a rope could signify an imaginary wall. Realistic-looking weapon props and risky physical activity are sometimes discouraged or forbidden for safety reasons. While the fictional timeline in a tabletop RPG often progresses in game-time, which may be much faster or slower than the time passing for players, LARPs are different in that they usually run in real-time, with game-time only being used in special circumstances.|$|E
