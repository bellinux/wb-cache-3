30|$|The {{use of a}} <b>recloser</b> or breaker with a <b>reclosing</b> relay at the substation, {{significantly}} {{reduces the}} number of sustained interruptions to a customer (SAIFI), the total duration of interruptions to the average customer (SAIDI) {{and the number of}} momentary interruptions (MAIFI). Single phase tripping is an option that utilities can utilize with modern high technology <b>recloser.</b> Since the vast majority of faults on distribution systems are line to ground, it makes sense to utilize the inherent capability of the <b>recloser</b> to operate in a single phase mode and thus reduce interruptions to customers on the other 2 phases [24]. The previous works between <b>reclosing</b> and reliability have not been studied on the similar <b>reclosing</b> operating mechanism with proposed <b>reclosing</b> method. However, the power supply to healthy phase by BESS to prevent the interruptions is similar with single phase <b>reclosing.</b> In [25], single phase <b>reclosing</b> yields an approximate 11 %~ 12 %, 12 %, and 16 % improvement in SAIDI, SAIFI, and MAIFI over a comparable system with three phase <b>reclosing,</b> respectively. Based on these results, we can expect the reliability improvement by proposed <b>reclosing</b> method. To perform the quantitative analysis of reliability, we will perform the reliability study considering the proposed <b>reclosing</b> method and system configuration.|$|R

40|$|In {{transmission}} system, the <b>reclosing</b> {{method is}} quite effective {{to restore the}} system after removing line faults by tripping circuit breakers. This is because the most of faults on overhead transmission system are transient in nature. Especially, high-speed <b>reclosing</b> scheme has a benefit increasing the continuity of supply due to fast restoration of system. It is possible to increase the transient stability due to high-speed <b>reclosing,</b> whereas it damages generator shafts due to fast closing. As one of alternatives, time-delayed <b>reclosing</b> can be proposed for transmission system. Time-delayed <b>reclosing</b> is a method having longer dead time than that of high-speed <b>reclosing.</b> However, if the system separation happens with high angle during long time, time-delayed <b>reclosing</b> may result in aggravation of stability. Thus, transient stability assessment must be considered for application of time-delayed <b>reclosing.</b> This paper models a 154 kV and 345 kV transmission systems using ElectroMagnetic Transient Program-Restructured Version (EMTP-RV) and performs transient stability assessment using Integral Square Error (ISE) developed by Dynamic Link Library (DLL) to assess the adequacy of time-delayed <b>reclosing</b> for modelled transmission system...|$|R

He had, like Maxwell, forgotten to <b>reclose</b> the breast-valve, but, unlike the more experienced diver, he had failed to discover his omission. He became flurried and anxious, and getting, more and more confused, fumbled nervously at his helmet to ascertain that all was right there. In so doing he opened the little regulating cock, which served to form an additional outlet to foul air. This of course made matters worse.
