40|$|High {{strength}} <b>rail</b> <b>steels</b> {{are used}} in heavy haul railway in Australia. However, there is still lack of understanding on the microstructures of these <b>rail</b> <b>steels.</b> Three high strength <b>rail</b> <b>steels</b> were investigated in this research. This study has three major purposes: (1) to determine microstructure quantitatively and qualitatively using SEM; (2) to investigate mechanical properties such as Young’s modulus and hardness using nanoindentation and microhardness test; (3) to correlate microstructure with mechanical properties for the high strength <b>rail</b> <b>steels.</b> In the first part, microstructure characterized by interlamellar spacing was determined quantitatively along the depth from gauge corner (GC) surface of a rail head. The {{results show that the}} interlamellar spacing increases with the depth from GC surface. This study then investigated the mechanical properties of these <b>rail</b> <b>steels</b> using nanoindentation. The Young’s modulus obtained from nanoindentation is in good agreement with monotonic tensile tests for the same grade of steels which obtained from literature. Pileups were observed in this study and this issue has been corrected using a method suggested in literature. Furthermore, the correlation between the interlamellar spacing with the mechanical properties obtained from nanoindentation has been examined. It shows that the microstructure-mechanical relationship in nanoscale cannot be described by the Hall-Petch relation, while the Hall-Petch relation can be used to describe the relationship between the interlamellar spacing and the hardness at microscale. The Hall-Petch relation at microscale obtained in this study was HV 0. 1 = 155 + 2185 λt− 1 / 2 HV, while the Hall-Petch relation at nanoscale was HN= 19. 8 + 4. 8 λt− 1 / 2...|$|R

50|$|It {{was founded}} in 1938, {{near the end of}} the Great Depression by John A. Schultz. The mill was set up in the former New York Central {{locomotive}} shop in Avis, across Pine Creek from Jersey Shore. The company began manufacturing steel rails for the railroad industry. In its first year of business Jersey Shore Steel was able to produce 15,000 tons of <b>rail</b> <b>steel.</b> When John A. Schultz died in 1943 the business was passed onto his sons Charles and John A. Jr. The brothers oversaw expansion and devastation. A massive fire nearly destroyed the steel mill in 1963 and the Agnes Flood of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley caused tremendous amounts of damage in 1972.

50|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>rails</b> {{began to}} replace iron {{later in the}} 19th century. Several railroads {{imported}} <b>steel</b> <b>rails</b> from England in the 1860s, and the first commercially available <b>steel</b> <b>rails</b> in the U.S. were manufactured in 1867 at the Cambria Iron Works in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. By the mid-1880s U.S. railroads were using more <b>steel</b> <b>rails</b> than iron in building new or replacement tracks.|$|R

40|$|In {{an effort}} to relate microstructure, {{mechanical}} properties, and magnetic properties {{as a tool for}} nondestructive testing, the coercivity and permeability of fully pearlitic <b>rail</b> <b>steels</b> having different compositions, microstructures, and hardnesses were measured between 2 ̆ 212200 and 6002 ̆ 0090 C.

50|$|When a {{train is}} braking, the low {{adhesion}} manifests as wheel slip where the wheelset is rotating {{at a lower}} velocity (speed) than the forward speed of the train. The most extreme {{example of this is}} where the wheel stops rotating altogether (wheel slide) while the train is still moving and can result in a “wheel flat” caused by the softer wheel steel being abraded away by the harder <b>rail</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{special case}} is heat related buckling: {{in hot weather}} the <b>rail</b> <b>steel</b> expands. This is managed by {{stressing}} continuously welded rails (they are tensioned mechanically to be stress neutral at a moderate temperature) and by providing proper expansion gaps at joints and ensuring that fishplates are properly lubricated. In addition, lateral restraint is provided by an adequate ballast shoulder. If any of these measures are inadequate, the track may buckle; a large lateral distortion takes place, which trains are unable to negotiate. (In nine years 2000/1 to 2008/9 there were 429 track buckle incidents in Great Britain).|$|E
5000|$|Steel {{roller coaster}} wheels {{are made with}} {{polyurethane}} which increase ride efficiency and have no chemical bond to the <b>rail.</b> <b>Steel</b> roller coaster wheel assemblies can change slightly with different manufacturers. A {{good example of this}} is the difference between B&M's track style and Arrow's. On B&M's coasters, the trains have their side friction wheels {{on the outside of the}} track, allowing the rails to connect from their inner edges. On Arrow coasters, the train has side friction wheels on the inside of the track, so the rail connectors must [...] "wrap around" [...] the outside of the rail and under the train.|$|E
50|$|Railroads {{saw their}} {{greatest}} growth in new track {{added in the}} last three decades of the 19th century. (See Table 2) Railroads also enjoyed high productivity growth during this time, mainly because of the introduction of new processes that made <b>steel</b> inexpensive. <b>Steel</b> <b>rails</b> lasted roughly ten times longer than iron <b>rails.</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>rails,</b> which became heavier as steel prices fell, enabled heavier, more powerful locomotives that could pull longer trains. Rail cars made of steel on steel roads could be made longer cars and had a load carrying to car weight ratio of 2:1 compared to cars made of iron at 1:1.|$|R

They are made of steel and are sometimes manufactured using durable <b>rail</b> <b>steel.</b> They can be used to support various types of wire or wire mesh. The end view of the post creates an obvious T, Y or other shape. The posts are driven into the ground with a manual or pneumatic post pounder. All along the post, along the spine, there are studs or nubs that prevent the barbed wire or mesh from sliding up or down the post. They are generally designated as 1.01, 1.25 or 1.33, referring to the weight in pounds per lineal foot. They are commonly painted with a white tip on top, white improves the visibility of the fence line.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{the ends}} of the rails are cleaned, aligned flat and true, and spaced apart 25 mm. This gap between rail ends for welding is to ensure {{consistent}} results in the pouring of the molten steel into the weld mold. In the event of a welding failure, the rail ends can be cropped to a 75 mm gap, removing the melted and damaged rail ends, and a new weld attempted with a special mould and larger thermite charge. A two or three piece hardened sand mould is clamped around the rail ends, and a torch of suitable heat capacity is used to preheat {{the ends of}} the rail and the interior of the mould. The proper amount of thermite with alloying metal is placed in a refractory crucible, and when the rails have reached a sufficient temperature, the thermite is ignited and allowed to react to completion (allowing time for any alloying metal to fully melt and mix, yielding the desired molten steel or alloy). The reaction crucible is then tapped at the bottom. Modern crucibles have a self-tapping thimble in the pouring nozzle. The molten steel flows into the mould, fusing with the rail ends and forming the weld. The slag, being lighter than the steel flows last from the crucible and overflows the mould into a steel catch basin, to be disposed of after cooling. The entire setup is allowed to cool. The mould is removed and the weld is cleaned by hot chiselling and grinding to produce a smooth joint. Typical time from start of the work until a train can run over the rail is approximately 45 minutes to more than an hour, depending on the rail size and ambient temperature. In any case, the <b>rail</b> <b>steel</b> must be cooled to less than 370 C before it can sustain the weight of rail locomotives.|$|E

The current work deals {{with one of the most}} important factors influencing the formation of manganese sulfide in converter <b>rail</b> <b>steel.</b> The thermodynamic calculations of <b>rail</b> <b>steel</b> crystallization at the cooling rate of 100 K/min. are given in the work. Computer simulation results are presented as graphs showing the separation of components, as well as curves showing the process of nonmetallic inclusions formation. It has been determined that chemical composition is the most important factor in the formation of non-metallic inclusions. Materials used for the <b>rail</b> <b>steel</b> production must meet the highest requirements as to the properties of materials, shape and durability. Non-metallic inclusions are one of the factors negatively influencing the strength of <b>rail</b> <b>steel.</b> The manganese sulfide precipitates during steel solidification as a result of segregation processes on the solidification front. One of the factors influencing the strength parameters of <b>rail</b> <b>steel</b> is sulphur, i. e. the main component of MnS. Sulphur is commonly considered to be a negative element in steel, except for the situation when it is purposefully added to improve its machinability. Computer simulation and theoretical analysis methods were used in this work.
