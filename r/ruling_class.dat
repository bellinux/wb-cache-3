5|$|The {{religious}} {{struggles of}} the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After {{the passing of the}} Test Act 1672, and with the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of William and Mary over the Jacobites, Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the Irish Parliament. Under the emerging Penal Laws, Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, while enriching a new <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> of Anglican conformists. The new Anglo-Irish <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> became known as the Protestant Ascendancy.|$|E
5|$|Japan first {{appears in}} written {{history in the}} Chinese Book of Han. According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the most {{powerful}} kingdom on the archipelago during the 3rd century was called Yamataikoku. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje, Korea and was promoted by Prince Shōtoku, but the subsequent development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.

5|$|Like other Spanish liberals, Goya {{was left}} in a {{difficult}} position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent <b>ruling</b> <b>class.</b> The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.|$|E
5|$|McAvoy {{starred in}} Shakespeare's Macbeth on London's West End in early 2013. Macbeth {{was the first}} {{performance}} at the Trafalgar Transformed, running from 9 February until 27 April. The production was directed by Jamie Lloyd who also directed McAvoy in his last stint on the stage in 2009's Three Days of Rain. In 2015, McAvoy won the Best Actor award at London's Evening Standard Theater Awards for his portrayal of Jack Gurney in The <b>Ruling</b> <b>Class,</b> {{a revival of the}} Peter Barnes play directed once again by Jamie Lloyd.

5|$|The {{turn of the}} 16th and 17th centuries brought changes that, for {{the time}} being, {{weakened}} the Commonwealth's powerful neighbors (The Tsardom of Russia, The Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire). The resulting opportunity for the Polish–Lithuanian state to improve its position depended {{on its ability to}} overcome internal distractions, such as the isolationist and pacifist tendencies that prevailed among the szlachta <b>ruling</b> <b>class,</b> or the rivalry between nobility leaders and elected kings, often intent on circumventing restrictions on their authority, such as the Henrician Articles.|$|E
50|$|In Marxism, bourgeois {{nationalism}} is the alleged practice by the <b>ruling</b> <b>classes</b> of deliberately dividing people by nationality, race, ethnicity, or religion, {{so as to}} distract them from initiating class warfare.

25|$|Unfortunately, Gramsci {{died before}} he could {{completely}} articulate how hegemony mediates the subordinate classes in periods of relative calm or how to work against {{the powers of the}} <b>ruling</b> <b>classes</b> as exerted in this way. Importantly, however, he had vastly complicated the ways that later Marxists would think about mediation: as a means of persuasion utilized by the <b>ruling</b> <b>classes,</b> rather than as complete control of the available ideas within a given culture (ideology).|$|R
5|$|A {{member of}} the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was a {{member of the}} nomenklatura, the country's de facto <b>ruling</b> <b>class.</b> Nikita Khrushchev chaired the Presidium from 1955 to 1964; Leonid Brezhnev succeeded him that year and chaired until 1982. In {{contrast}} to full members, candidate members of the Presidium could not vote during Presidium sessions. It was normal that a full member of the Presidium had previously served as a candidate member, but this was not always the case. During the term 23 people held seats in the Presidium: 14 full members and 9 candidate members. One candidate member was promoted to full membership in the Presidium during the term. Not a single Presidium member died during this period while retaining office.|$|E
5|$|Alt Clut (named {{after the}} Brythonic name for Dumbarton Rock, the Medieval {{capital of the}} Strathclyde region) may have had its origins with the Damnonii people of Ptolemy's Geographia. Two kings are known from near {{contemporary}} sources in this early period. The first is Coroticus or Ceretic (Ceredig), known as the recipient of a letter from Saint Patrick, and stated by a 7th-century biographer to have been king of the Height of the Clyde, Dumbarton Rock, placing him {{in the second half}} of the 5th century. From Patrick's letter it is clear that Ceretic was a Christian, and it is likely that the <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> of the area were also Christians, at least in name. His descendant Rhydderch Hael is named in Adomnán's Life of Saint Columba.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the proletariat}} gained class {{consciousness}} and thus {{was prepared to}} revolt against the <b>ruling</b> <b>classes,</b> the vanguard party would serve another purpose. The party would coordinate the proletariat through its revolution by acting as a military command hub of sorts. This is, according to Leninists, a vital function as mass revolutions can sometimes be easily crushed by the disciplined military of the <b>ruling</b> <b>classes.</b> The vanguards would serve as commanders of the revolt, chosen to their positions by [...] "democratic natural selection".|$|R

5|$|Henry's {{mother was}} the eldest {{daughter}} of Henry I, King of England and Duke of Normandy. She {{was born into a}} powerful <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> of Normans, who traditionally owned extensive estates in both England and Normandy, and her first husband had been the Holy Roman Emperor Henry V. Following her father's death in 1135, Matilda hoped to claim the English throne, but instead her cousin Stephen of Blois was crowned king and recognised as the Duke of Normandy, resulting in civil war between their rival supporters. Geoffrey took advantage of the confusion to attack the Duchy of Normandy but played no direct role in the English conflict, leaving this to Matilda and her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester. The war, termed the Anarchy by Victorian historians, dragged on and degenerated into stalemate.|$|E
5|$|Japan's feudal era was {{characterized}} by the emergence and dominance of a <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> of warriors, the samurai. In 1185, following {{the defeat of the}} Taira clan in the Genpei War, sung in the epic Tale of Heike, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed shogun by Emperor Go-Toba, and Yoritomo established a base of power in Kamakura. After his death, the Hōjō clan came to power as regents for the shoguns. The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class. The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281, but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo. Emperor Go-Daigo was himself defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336.|$|E
5|$|Prince Paul {{recognised}} {{the lack}} of national solidarity and political weakness of his country, and after he assumed power he made repeated attempts to negotiate a political settlement with Maček, {{the leader of the}} dominant Croat political party in Yugoslavia, the HSS. In January 1937, Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović met with Maček at Prince Paul's request, but Stojadinović was unwilling or unable to grapple with the issue of Croat dissatisfaction with a Yugoslavia dominated by the Serb <b>ruling</b> <b>class.</b> In 1938, the Anschluss brought the Third Reich to the borders of Yugoslavia, and early elections were held in December. In this background, the Royal Yugoslav Air Force (VVKJ) commander, General Dušan Simović had been involved in two coup plots in early 1938 driven by Serb opposition to the Concordat with the Vatican, and another coup plot following the December election.|$|E
2500|$|Later Marxists such as Gramsci would problematize {{this notion}} of {{ideology}} or false consciousness by studying the ways that workers operate during periods of “organic crisis,” or those times when social classes become detached from their traditional parties and a violent overthrow of the <b>ruling</b> <b>classes</b> is possible. Seeking to describe the ways that governments regain control of these classes during such periods of unrest, Gramsci developed the idea of hegemony, a process by which social actors within the <b>ruling</b> <b>classes</b> convince subordinate classes to consent to their own oppression once again: ...|$|R

40|$|The Argentinean {{crisis in}} the late 1990 s and early 2000 s was another manifestation of various "neoliberal crises" that struck Latin America, Asia, Turkey, and Russia. During the 1990 s, Argentina {{underwent}} typical neoliberal reforms: further opening of trade, liberalization of capital movements, convertibility, pension funds, and so on in the general context of large public and external debt rendered unbearable by interest rates' rise in 1979. As in other countries, these trends were the expression of this new social order's strong bias {{to the advantage of}} central and peripheral <b>ruling</b> <b>classes.</b> The Argentinean crisis also owes much to the stand taken by its <b>ruling</b> <b>classes</b> in their attempt to insert themselves under favorable conditions within the new configuration of imperialism. The national economy was sold to international transnational corporations and financial interests, while national <b>ruling</b> <b>classes</b> finance accumulation in the United States. Postcrisis trends manifest the difficulty to define a new strategy...|$|R
5|$|Spending {{summer and}} autumn 1836 in Trier, Marx became more serious about his studies and his life. He became engaged to Jenny von Westphalen, an educated {{baroness}} of the Prussian <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> {{who had known}} Marx since childhood. As she had broken off her engagement with a young aristocrat to be with Marx, their relationship was socially controversial owing to the differences between their religious and class origins, but Marx befriended her father Ludwig von Westphalen (a liberal aristocrat) and later dedicated his doctoral thesis to him. Seven years after their engagement, on 19 June 1843 they got married in a Protestant church in Kreuznach.|$|E
5|$|Supported by the Han military, Minyue was {{established}} in 202 BC and Eastern Ou in 192 BC {{after the fall of}} the Qin dynasty. Zhao Tuo, a former Chinese commander of the Qin, established Nanyue in 208 BC after the death of the emperor Qin Shi Huang. Emperor Gaozu, first emperor of the Han dynasty, approved Zhao Tuo's new title as king. Zhao was born in the city of Zhending in Central China, and the <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> of the new kingdom was composed of Chinese officials from the former Qin dynasty. In 180 BC, Zhao offered to submit as a vassal state and the Han accepted, a decision partly based on his family's northern Chinese ancestry.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{records that}} in 1097 King WilliamII ordered a wall {{to be built}} around the Tower of London; it was {{probably}} built from stone {{as a replacement for}} the timber palisade that arced around the north and west sides of the castle, between the Roman wall and the Thames. The Norman Conquest of London manifested itself not only with a new <b>ruling</b> <b>class,</b> but in the way the city was structured. Land was confiscated and redistributed amongst the Normans, who also brought over hundreds of Jews, for financial reasons. The Jews arrived under the direct protection of the Crown, as a result of which Jewish communities were often found close to castles. The Jews used the Tower as a retreat, when threatened by anti-Jewish violence.|$|E

5|$|The {{accusations against}} Clarence, Stephen, Gull and Druitt also draw on {{cultural}} {{perceptions of a}} decadent <b>ruling</b> <b>class,</b> and depict a high-born murderer or murderers preying on lower-class victims. Because Druitt and the other upper-middle-class and aristocratic Ripper suspects were wealthy, there is more biographical material on them than on {{the residents of the}} Whitechapel slums. Consequently, it is easier for writers to construct solutions based on a wealthy culprit rather than one involving a Whitechapel resident. There is no direct evidence against Druitt, and since the 1970s, the number of Jack the Ripper suspects has continued to grow, with the result that there are now over 100 different theories about the Ripper's identity.|$|E
5|$|The lavishness of the {{architecture}} that was to arise from this disaster is connected with the politics of Sicily at the time; Sicily was still officially under Spanish rule, but rule was effectively delegated to the native aristocracy. This was led by the Duke of Camastra, whom the Spanish had appointed viceroy to appease the aristocracy, who were numerous. The aristocracy was relatively concentrated compared to most of Europe, and a gentry class was missing. In the 18th century, one estimate held that there were 228 noble families, who provided Sicily with a <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> consisting of 58 princes, 27 dukes, 37 marquesses, 26 Counts, one viscount and 79 barons; the Golden Book of the Sicilian nobility (last published in 1926) lists even more. In addition to these were the younger scions of the families, with their courtesy titles of nobile or baron.|$|E
5|$|A weary Emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, an {{increasingly}} discontented <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: all these factors presaged the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve the overthrow of the Imperial system would soon appear within the Army ranks. Republicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, and had little support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a serious threat to the monarchy. These officers favored a republican dictatorship, which they believed would be superior to the liberal democratic monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination {{at the beginning of the}} 1880s, discontent in the army grew in scope and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor was uninterested and the politicians proved incapable of re-establishing the government's authority over the military.|$|E
