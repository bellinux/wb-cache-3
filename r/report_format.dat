40|$|This study {{examines}} users’ perceptions of three digital reporting formats: PDF, HTML and XBRL. Using public accounting practitioners as participants, this {{study examines}} users’ perceptions of different <b>reporting</b> <b>formats</b> used in disseminating financial information. This study includes examining the link between users’ perceptions and preferred <b>reporting</b> <b>format</b> and whether these perceptions {{are similar to the}} quality of their decision in the completion of a specific task. This study follows Davis (1989, p. 320) who defined perceptions into 2 : perceived usefulness as “the degree a user believes that a particular aid would enhance his performance” and perceived ease of use as “the degree to which a user believes that using a particular aid would reduce or be free of effort”. The results indicate that users’ perceptions of usefulness among the digital <b>reporting</b> <b>formats</b> differ significantly. However, perceptions of ease of use are similar across the three digital <b>reporting</b> <b>formats.</b> Users’ perceptions are also found to influence their preferred <b>reporting</b> <b>format.</b> The findings also show that users’ perceptions of usefulness are analogous to their decision accuracy for HTML and XBRL formats but not for PDF format. Perceptions of ease of use, however, do not correspond to actual cognitive effort for all <b>reporting</b> <b>formats.</b> The results indicate that if more advanced forms of digital reporting are to be encouraged, there is also the need for users to be made more aware of the benefits to be gained from the different forms of reporting...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the first version}} of a <b>reporting</b> <b>format</b> for modelling studies which is based on a general <b>reporting</b> <b>format</b> by our taskforce, which was published in the previous issue of this journal. The use of decision-analytical models for economic evaluations is increasing because, in practice, it is not always possible to derive information from prospective studies. However, the acceptance of modelling studies is generally lower than prospective studies {{not only because of the}} use of secondary data, but also because the reports of modelling studies do not always have sufficient transparency. Hence, a standardised <b>reporting</b> <b>format</b> may improve the transparency and, consequently, the acceptance of modelling studies. This {{article presents}} an example of a <b>reporting</b> <b>format</b> for economic evaluation based on modelling studies, which may facilitate the development of future guidelines for modelling studies. The format consists of a number of headings, which are followed by a brief recommendation on the content. This format does not deal with methodology and data management, but especially addresses validation and quality assurance, which may increase the transparency of the report.
