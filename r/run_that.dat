Odell Beckham Jr. then returned the kickoff that ensued 82-yards to the Crimson Tide 18-yard line. However, the offense was unable {{to capitalize on the}} good field position as the Alabama defense forced a turnover on downs. The Crimson Tide then drove 78 yards in eight plays, capping the drive with a three-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Jalston Fowler that made the score 38–17. The Alabama defense then closed the game with three consecutive sacks of Mettenberger, winning 38–17. For his 12 tackle performance, C. J.

5|$|England {{dominated}} the 2004 series and claimed the first English whitewash in the Wisden Trophy's history. England won each Test comfortably, as the West Indian bowlers {{struggled to get}} wickets. Only Chris Gayle and Dwayne Bravo had bowling averages lower than 30. This whitewash meant that England had won seven consecutive Tests {{for the first time}} in 75 years. The series was the beginning of a <b>run</b> <b>that</b> would see England win the Ashes the following year.|$|E
5|$|Exactly 100 {{days after}} the Flames last held a playoff position, they climbed back into the top eight with a 7–0–1 <b>run</b> <b>that</b> culminated in a 3–1 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks.

5|$|Having found {{success in}} both {{domestic}} and European cup competitions, Revie took the decision to focus exclusively on the league for the 1968–69 campaign. They went {{the rest of the}} season unbeaten in the league following a 5–1 defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor on 19 October, and secured the title with a 0–0 draw with challengers Liverpool at Anfield; after the game Revie led his team back out onto the pitch to applaud the Liverpool supporters, who in turn applauded the Leeds team. His team set a number of records: most points (67), most wins (27), fewest defeats (2), and most home points (39); a still-unbroken club record is their 34 match unbeaten <b>run</b> <b>that</b> extended into the following season.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Jabara {{was given}} {{command of the}} 31st Tactical Fighter Wing at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida. By 1966 Jabara had risen {{to the rank of}} colonel—the {{youngest}} at that rank at the time, and he volunteered to fly combat missions for the Vietnam War. He flew his first mission in July 1966, joining a F-100 Super Sabre flight group for a bombing <b>run</b> <b>that</b> damaged several buildings held by the Viet Cong in South Vietnam. He returned on leave to Homestead about a week after the mission.|$|E
5|$|In {{the game}} with Auburn, Tech piled up 472 yards {{on the ground in}} 84 rushes and 145 yards in the air. Guyon scored four {{touchdown}}s, and Strupper had a 65-yard touchdown run. According to the Atlanta Journal,It was not the length of the <b>run</b> <b>that</b> featured it was the brilliance of it. After getting through the first line, Stroop was tackled squarely by two secondary men, and yet he squirmed and jerked loosed from them, only to face the safety man and another Tiger, coming at him from different angles. Without checking his speed Everett knifed the two men completely, running between them and dashing on to a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the team had yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, who had worked with Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production <b>run</b> <b>that</b> could be used for their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E
5|$|Ole Miss {{scored the}} only {{points of the}} third quarter on a 12-yard Randall Mackey {{touchdown}} <b>run</b> <b>that</b> capped a 70-yard drive that saw the Rebels convert a pair of fourth downs. The final margin of 33–14 was provided by a pair of Shelley field goals from 26 and 24 yards in the fourth quarter. In the game, McCarron eclipsed Brody Croyle's team record of 190 consecutive pass attempts without throwing an interception. Starting wide receiver DeAndrew White and backup running back Demetrius Hart both suffered knee injuries {{during the course of the}} game that sidelined both of them for the remainder of the season. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Rebels to 46–9–2 (50–8–2 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
