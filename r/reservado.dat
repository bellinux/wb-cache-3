40|$|Growth {{failure is}} {{frequent}} and a clinically important issue {{in children with}} chronic kidney disease (CKD). Many factors contribute to impaired growth in these children, including abnormalities in the growth hormone (GH) - {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF- 1) axis, malnutrition, acidosis, renal bone disease and glucocorticoid associated treatment. The management of growth failure in children with CKD is complicated by the presence of other-disease related complications requiring medical intervention. Despite evidence of GH efficacy and safety in this population, this therapy is still underutilized. This review shows the impact, the causes and the treatment of growth failure in children with CKD. copyright© ABE&M todos os direitos <b>reservados...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: To verify if the {{frequency}} of spontaneous pubertal development among girls with Turner syndrome (TS) diagnosed in infancy and childhood is {{greater than that of}} patients diagnosed later. Subjects and methods: Thirty three girls aged 13 years diagnosed at the same service. Results: Sixteen of 32 informative patients had signs of spontaneous puberty, a frequency greater than that of patients diagnosed later. In six patients, there was no progression of puberty; menarche occurred in six, and one became pregnant, but the fetus was a stillborn. Spontaneous puberty was absent in all cases with 45,X karyotype. Conclusions: The greater prevalence of spontaneous puberty in girls whose diagnosis was not based on pubertal delay suggests that, among those diagnosed later, there is a bias towards patients with hypogonadism. © ABE&M todos os direitos <b>reservados...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: To date, {{about sixty}} {{different}} mutations within GH receptor (GHR) gene {{have been described}} in patients with GH insensitivity syndrome (GHI). In this report, we described a novel nonsense mutation of GHR. Methods: The patient was evaluated {{at the age of}} 6 yr, for short stature associated to clinical phenotype of GHI. GH, IGF- 1, and GHBP levels were determined. The PCR products from exons 2 – 10 were sequenced. Results: The patient had high GH (26 µg/L), low IGF- 1 (22. 5 ng/ml) and undetectable GHBP levels. The sequencing of GHR exon 5 disclosed adenine duplication at nucleotide 338 of GHR coding sequence (c. 338 dupA) in homozygous state. Conclusion: We described a novel mutation that causes a truncated GHR and a loss of receptor function {{due to the lack of}} amino acids comprising the transmembrane and intracellular regions of GHR protein, leading to GHI.

40|$|The glucose-fatty acid cycle {{explains}} {{the preference for}} fatty acid during moderate and long duration physical exercise. In contrast, {{there is a high}} glucose availability and oxidation rate in response to intense physical exercise. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during physical exercise suggests that the redox balance is important to regulate of lipids/carbohydrate metabolism. ROS reduces the activity of the Krebs cycle, and increases the activity of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins. The opposite effects happen during moderate physical activity. Thus, some issues is highlighted in the present review: Why does skeletal muscle prefer lipids in the basal and during moderate physical activity? Why does glucose-fatty acid fail to carry out their effects during intense physical exercise? How skeletal muscles regulate the lipids and carbohydrate metabolism during the contraction-relaxation cycle?. © ABE&M todos os direitos <b>reservados...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the relationship between}} resting metabolic rate (RMR) and body composition of postmenopausal women. Methods: Thirty physically inactive women participated in the study, and their age average was 54, 33 ± 5, 20 years old. Oxygen consumption was measured by indirect calorimetry after 12 hours of fasting and the values were calculated according to the equation of Weir. Body composition was obtained by the method of skinfolds and the measurement of waist circumference (WC) {{was used to assess}} abdominal fat. The linear correlation of Pearson was used to establish correlations between the variables. Results: We found significant correlations of TMR with the CC (0. 42) and the lean mass (LM) (r = 0. 48). Conclusions: The variables of body composition that can be involved in the determination of the RMR are LM and WC. © ABE&M todos os direitos <b>reservados...</b>|$|R
40|$|Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (Aids) was {{initially}} related to HIV-associated wasting syndrome, and its metabolic disturbances to altered body composition. After Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) was started, malnutrition has declined and HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome {{has emerged as}} an important metabolic disorder. Aids is also characterized by hormonal disturbances, principally in growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 (GH/IGF- 1) axis. The use of recombinant human GH (hrGH) was formerly indicated to treat wasting syndrome, {{in order to increase}} lean body mass. Even though the use of hrGH in lipodystrophy syndrome has been considered, the decrease in insulin sensitivity is a limitation for its use, which has not been officially approved yet. Diversity in therapeutic regimen is another limitation to its use in Aids patients.

40|$|Objective: Evaluate the {{efficacy}} of cumulative doses (CDs) of 131 I-iodide therapy (RIT) in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Subjects and methods: The probability of progressive disease according to CDs was evaluated in patients ≤ 45 years old and > 45 years old and correlated to tumor-node-metastasis (TNM), thyroglobulin values, histological types and variants, age, and zduration of the disease. Results: At {{the end of a}} follow-up period of 69 ± 56 months, 85 out of 150 DTC patients submitted to fixed doses RIT had no evidence of disease, 47 had stable disease and 18 had progressive disease. Higher CDs were used in the more aggressive variants (p 45 years old and with CDs ≥ 800 mCi in patients ≤ 45 years. Conclusion: Although some patients may still respond to high CDs, the impact of further RIT should be carefully evaluated and other treatment strategies may be warranted. © ABE&M todos os direitos <b>reservados...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{insulin resistance}} and lipid profle {{in women with}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) caused by classical 21 -hydroxylase defciency (21 OHD), and their association with body mass index (BMI) and corticosteroid dosage. Subjects and methods: We assessed BMI, waist circumference, current glucocorticoid dosage, glucose, insulin and lipid profle in eighteen young women (mean ± SD, 19. 3 ± 3. 0 years) with 21 OHD CAH. Results: BMI was normal in 12 patients, 5 of them were overweight, and 1 was obese. Waist circumference was high in 7 patients. Fasting insulin and HOMA-IR were elevated in seven and eight patients, respectively. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were high in only two patients, and HDL-cholesterol was low in four. Insulin resistance {{was not associated with}} BMI, waist circumference or gluco-corticoid dose. Conclusions: Young women with 21 OHD CAH had infrequent dyslipidemia, but had a higher prevalence of insulin resistance and central obesity, that were independent of BMI or corticosteroid dosage. © ABE&M todos os direitos <b>reservados...</b>|$|R
