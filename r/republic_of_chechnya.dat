25|$|Until 2010, the Russian <b>republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya</b> was {{the region}} with the highest birth rate in the former USSR (excluding Central Asia). However, in 2011, the Armenian {{province}} of Qashatagh overtook it (28.9 vs 29.3 per 1.000).|$|E
25|$|Gamsakhurdia {{was elected}} {{president}} on May 26, 1991, with 86% of the vote. He was subsequently widely criticised for what was perceived to be an erratic and authoritarian style of government, with nationalists and reformists joining forces in an uneasy anti-Gamsakhurdia coalition. A tense situation was worsened by {{the large amount of}} ex-Soviet weaponry available to the quarreling parties and by the growing power of paramilitary groups. The situation came to a head on December 22, 1991, when armed opposition groups launched a violent military coup d'état, besieging Gamsakhurdia and his supporters in government buildings in central Tbilisi. Gamsakhurdia managed to evade his enemies and fled to the breakaway Russian <b>republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya</b> in January 1992.|$|E
50|$|The {{violence}} was mostly {{concentrated in the}} North Caucasus <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> Dagestan, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria. Occasional incidents happen in surrounding regions, like North Ossetia-Alania, Karachay-Cherkessia, Stavropol Krai and Volgograd Oblast.|$|R

50|$|The Vainakhish {{language}} {{consist of}} the dialect continuum between the Chechen and Ingush languages, mainly spoken in the Russian <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya</b> and Ingushetia, {{as well as}} in the Chechen diaspora. Together with Bats it forms the Nakh branch of the Northeast Caucasian languages family.|$|R
25|$|On December 22, 1991, armed {{opposition}} supporters {{launched a}} violent coup d'état and attacked {{a number of}} official buildings including the Georgian parliament building, where Gamsakhurdia himself was sheltering. Heavy fighting continued in Tbilisi until January 6, 1992, leaving hundreds dead and {{the centre of the}} city heavily damaged. On January 6, Gamsakhurdia and members of his government escaped through opposition lines and made their way to Azerbaijan where they were denied asylum. Armenia finally hosted Gamsakhurdia for a short period and rejected Georgian demand to extradite Gamsakhurdia back to Georgia. In order not to complicate tense relations with Georgia, Armenian authorities allowed Gamsakhurdia to move to the breakaway Russian <b>republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> where he was granted asylum by the rebel government of General Dzhokhar Dudayev.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{profusion of}} small parties and their aversion to {{coherent}} alliances left the legislature chaotic. During 1993, Yeltsin's rift with the parliamentary leadership led to the September–October 1993 constitutional crisis. The crisis climaxed on 3 October, when Yeltsin chose a radical solution to settle his dispute with parliament: he called up tanks to shell the Russian White House, blasting out his opponents. As Yeltsin was taking the unconstitutional step of dissolving the legislature, Russia came close to a serious civil conflict. Yeltsin was then free to impose the current Russian constitution with strong presidential powers, which was approved by referendum in December 1993. The cohesion of the Russian Federation was also threatened when the <b>republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya</b> attempted to break away, leading to the First and Second Chechen Wars.|$|E
2500|$|Shevardnadze also faced separatist {{conflicts}} in the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. [...] The war in the Russian <b>republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya</b> on Georgia's northern border caused considerable friction with Russia, which accused Shevardnadze of harbouring Chechen guerrillas and in apparent retaliation supported Georgian separatists. Further friction was caused by Shevardnadze's {{close relationship with the}} United States, which saw him as a counterbalance to Russian influence in the strategic Transcaucasus region. Under Shevardnadze's strongly pro-Western administration, Georgia became a major recipient of U.S. foreign and military aid, signed a strategic partnership with NATO and declared an ambition to join both NATO and the European Union.|$|E
50|$|Located on the {{northern}} slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, Tusheti is bordered by the Russian <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya</b> and Dagestan {{to the north and}} east, respectively; and by the Georgian historic provinces Kakheti and Pshav-Khevsureti to the south and west, respectively. The population of the area is mainly ethnic Georgians called Tushs or Tushetians (tushebi).|$|R
5000|$|Vilayat Dagestan (Province of Dagestan, Вилайят Дагестан, Vilayyat Dagestan), {{formerly}} known as Shariat Jamaat, is an Islamist Jihadist group based in the Russian <b>republic</b> <b>of</b> Dagestan and {{is part of the}} Caucasus Emirate.

The total land area was about 70000 km2, with a population of about 1 million. Its capital was initially at Vladikavkaz, then Nazran, and finally Temir-Khan-Shura.|$|R
2500|$|According to the Kremlin's aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky, [...] "When {{they were}} told that the {{withdrawal}} of troops was unrealistic within the short period, that it was a very long process, the terrorists put forward the demand to withdraw Russian troops from anywhere in the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya</b> without specifying which area it was." [...] The hostage-takers demanded termination of the use of artillery and air forces in Chechnya starting the next day (Russian forces ceased using heavy weapons until 28 September), a halt to the notorious zachistka ("mopping-up") operations, and that President of Russia Vladimir Putin should publicly declare that he was striving to stop the war in Chechnya. By the time of the hostage-taking, the conflict in the embattled republic was killing an average of three federal troops daily.|$|E
2500|$|Environmental {{agencies}} {{warn that}} the Russian <b>republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> devastated by war, now faces ecological disaster. A former aide to Boris Yeltsin believes Russian bombing has rendered Chechnya an [...] "environmental wasteland." [...] There is a special concern over widespread oil spills and pollution from sewers damaged by war (the water is polluted {{to a depth of}} 250 m), and chemical and radioactive pollution, {{as a result of the}} bombardment of chemical facilities and storages during the conflict. Chechnya's wildlife also sustained heavy damage during the hostilities, as animals that had once populated the Chechen forests have moved off to seek safer ground. In 2004, Russian government has designated one-third of Chechnya a [...] "zone of ecological disaster" [...] and another 40% [...] "a zone of extreme environmental distress".|$|E
2500|$|By September 3, {{seven of}} the 11 killed members of the armed group were {{announced}} as identified by the Georgian Interior Ministry. Among them were two Georgian citizens, Bahaudin Kavtarashvili (born in 1986) and Aslan Margoshvili (born in 1990). Another, Bahaudin Baghakashvili (born in 1986), was born in Grozny but had relatives in Georgia's Pankisi Gorge. According to unofficial reports, the total of six of those killed were natives of Pankisi. Five others, including Baghakashvili, were Russian citizens from the North Caucasus, specifically the former Chechen–Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic: Musa Aduyev (born in 1981), Dukvakha Doshuyev (born in 1968) and Salam Zaurbekov (born in 1991) from the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> and Jabrail Khashiev (born in 1989) from the Republic of Ingushetia. The most prominent among the killed alleged militants was Doshuyev, veteran of the First Chechen War of 1994–1996 and a former bodyguard of Zakayev. Doshuyev had been detained and then given amnesty by Russian federal forces in early 2000. [...] Notably, Moscow unsuccessfully tried to use him as a witness in their 2003 attempt to have Zakayev extradited from his self-exile in London. Zakayev commented: [...] "I know that Dukvakha Dushuev, having political asylum in Great Britain, was not in Russia and lived in the Pankisi Gorge, Georgia {{for the last six}} months. It is unclear how he joined this group." ...|$|E

50|$|In 2005, Biden cosponsored a Senate {{resolution}} criticizing Russia {{for failing}} to uphold its commitments at the 1999 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Summit, which included agreements on a completed Russian military withdrawal from Moldova. That resolution also expressed disapproval of Russia’s demand for {{the closure of the}} OSCE Border Monitoring Operation (BMO), which served to observe border crossings between Georgia and the Russian <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> Dagestan, and Ingushetia. That bill passed in the Senate.|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{identify}} factors {{conducive to the}} (in) efficacy of indigenous forces (IF) in counterinsurgency (COIN) operations in Russia’s <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya</b> and Dagestan. Empirically, {{it is the first}} study to offer an examination of the deployment of IF in the North Caucasus-based COIN. The findings of this article emphasize that the effectiveness <b>of</b> COIN in <b>Chechnya,</b> unlike Dagestan, is conditioned by a number of factors pertaining to the structural and organizational characteristics of IF. Of these, the IF’s experience as former insurgents, their access to insider information, and their loyalty to incumbents – often maintained by the threat of collective punishment – have proven decisive for a relatively successful COIN in Chechnya...|$|R

50|$|In 1994, Yeltsin {{despatched}} 40,000 {{troops to}} the southern region <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya</b> to prevent its secession from Russia. Living 1000 mi south of Moscow, the predominantly Muslim Chechens for centuries had gloried in defying the Russians. Dzhokhar Dudayev, the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya’s</b> nationalist president, was driven to take his <b>republic</b> out <b>of</b> the Russian Federation, and had declared Chechnya's independence in 1991. Russia was quickly submerged in a quagmire {{like that of the}} U.S. in the Vietnam War. When the Russians attacked the Chechen capital of Grozny during the first weeks of January 1995, about 25,000 civilians died under week-long air raids and artillery fire in the sealed-off city. Massive use of artillery and air-strikes remained the dominating strategy throughout the Russian campaign. Even so, Chechen insurgents seized thousands of Russian hostages, while inflicting humiliating losses on the demoralized and ill-equipped Russian troops. Russian troops had not secured the Chechen capital of Grozny by year's end.|$|R

25|$|Since 2000, Russia {{has also}} {{experienced}} {{a string of}} suicide bombings that killed hundreds {{of people in the}} Caucasian <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> Dagestan and Ingushetia, as well as in Russia proper including Moscow. Responsibility for most of these attacks were claimed by either Shamil Basayev's Islamic-nationalist rebel faction or, later, by Dokka Umarov's pan-Islamist movement Caucasus Emirate which is aiming to unite most of Russia's North Caucasus as an emirate since its creation in 2007. Since the creation of the Caucasus Emirate, the group has abandoned its secular nationalist goals and fully adopted the ideology of Salafist-takfiri Jihadism which seeks to advance the cause of Allah on the earth by waging war against the Russian government and non-Muslims in the North Caucasus, such as the local Sufi Muslim population, whom they view as mushrikeen (polytheists) who do not adhere to true Islamic teachings. In 2011, the U.S. Department of State included the Caucasus Emirate on its list of terrorist organisations.|$|R

50|$|The first {{legislative}} elections {{under the}} new constitution included a few irregularities. The <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> Tatarstan and <b>Chechnya</b> and Chelyabinsk Oblast boycotted the voting; this action, along with other discrepancies, resulted in the election of only 170 members to the Federation Council. However, by mid-1994 all seats were filled except those <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> which continued to proclaim its independence. All federal jurisdictions participated in the December 1995 legislative elections, although the fairness <b>of</b> voting in <b>Chechnya</b> was compromised by the ongoing conflict there.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{political}} unit {{known as the}} “state” first arose in Westphalian Europe, the world’s geopolitical map has undergone a process of steady evolution.

Failed UNC secessions, such as Katanga (Democratic <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> the Congo), Biafra (Nigeria), the Turkish <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Northern Cyprus (<b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Cyprus), <b>Chechnya</b> (Russian Federation), Abkhazia (Georgia), South Ossetia (Georgia), Transnistria (Moldova), and Nagorno-Karabakh (Azerbaijan), similarly attest to the potential geopolitical impact of this method of state creation...|$|R

Strong Persian cultural influence can be traced up as far as Tatarstan in central Russia. Dagestan remains the bastion of Persian culture in the North Caucasus with fine examples of Iranian architecture like the Sassanid citadel in Derbent, strong influence of Persian cuisine, and common Persian names amongst the ethnic peoples of Dagestan. The ethnic Persian population of the North Caucasus, the Tats, remain, despite strong assimilation over the years, still visible in several North Caucasian cities. Even today, after decades of partition, some of these regions retain a sort of Iranian identity, as seen in their old beliefs, traditions and customs (e.g. Norouz).|$|R
