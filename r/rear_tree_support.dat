By analyzing the training samples, penalty factor C and the kernel function parametersγ have effects on the recognition rate of bearing fault, then a approximate method to determine optimum value are proposed, Compared with the traditional single sensor by using the components energy of EMD as feature, {{the results show that}} the proposed method in this paper significantly reduce feature extraction time, and improve diagnostic accuracy, which is up to 99. 82 %. This method is simple, effective and fast in feature extraction and meets the bearing diagnosis requirement of real-time fault diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{protocol}} for controlling a shared ATM multicast <b>tree</b> <b>supporting</b> many-to-many communication. The protocol supports one or several ATM VCCs of the many-to-many type. The number of VCCs {{is independent of}} the number of endpoints. The protocol guarantees that there is no interleaving on any VCC of the tree. The protocol also guarantees that the traffic contract associated with the VCCs is respected, thus making it possible to use ordinary VCCs of the CBR, VBR or UBR class. No re-sequencing server is required, and all cell forwarding is performed at the ATM layer. We describe the protocol both informally and formally.
