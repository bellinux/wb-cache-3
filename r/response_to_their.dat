5|$|The fatwa {{appeared}} to enjoy wide currency within the Muslim and Morisco community in various kingdoms of Spain, {{for it was}} translated and copied as late as 1563 and 1609. The full geographical reach of the text is unknown, but it {{appeared to}} be originally addressed to the Muslims (or Moriscos) of Castile as a <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> forced conversions in 1500–1502. After the forced conversion was extended to the Crown of Aragon in the 1520s, the fatwa likely circulated there, too.|$|E

5|$|Another stock {{plot device}} in the 1970s was the gay {{character}} in a police drama. They served as victims of blackmail or anti-gay violence, but more often as criminals. Beginning in the late 1960s with N.Y.P.D., Police Story, and Police Woman, the use of homosexuals in stories became much more prevalent, according to Vito Russo, as a <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> higher profiles in gay activism. Lesbians were included as villains, motivated to murder by their desires, internalized homophobia, or fear of being exposed as homosexual. One episode of Police Woman earned protests by the National Gay Task Force before it aired for portraying a trio of murderous lesbians who killed retirement home patients for their money. NBC edited the episode because of the protests, but a sit-in was staged in the head of NBC's offices.|$|E
5|$|In <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> disqualification, {{former presidents}} Hubert Maga and Sourou-Migan Apithy staged protests while Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, another ex-president, {{supported}} an obscure candidate named Basile Adjou Moumouni. The election {{was held on}} May 15, and was Dahomey's first since 1964. Moumouni won the election with 80 percent of the vote, but Alley declared the result void because the protest prevented nearly three-quarters of the electorate from voting. This result sparked further demonstrations, and Maga, Apithy, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and former president Christophe Soglo were forbidden to enter the country, {{in an attempt to}} crack down on dissent. Alley felt he had made a mistake in disqualifying Maga, Apithy, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, as he believed that only they could bring unity to Dahomey.|$|E

5|$|The first trade dollars {{were struck}} in 1873, and the {{majority}} of the coins were sent to China. Eventually, bullion producers began converting large amounts of silver into trade dollars, causing the coins to make their way into American commercial channels. This caused frustration among those to whom they were given in payment, as the coins were largely maligned and traded for less than one dollar each. In <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> wide distribution in American commerce, the coins were officially demonetized in 1876, but continued to circulate. Production of business strikes ended in 1878, though the mintage of proof coins officially continued until 1883. The trade dollar was re-monetized when the Coinage Act of 1965 was signed into law.|$|E
5|$|In 629, the Islamic Prophet Muhammad had {{recently}} succeeded in unifying all the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula. Those tribes {{had previously been}} too divided to pose a serious military challenge to the Byzantines or the Persians. Now unified and animated by their new conversion to Islam, they comprised {{one of the most}} powerful states in the region. The first conflict between the Byzantines and Muslims was the Battle of Mu'tah in September 629. A small Muslim skirmishing force attacked the province of Arabia in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> ambassador's murder at the hands of the Ghassanid Roman governor, but were repulsed. Because the engagement was a Byzantine victory, there was no apparent reason to make changes to the military configuration of the region. Also, the Byzantines had little preceding battlefield experience with the Arabs, and even less with zealous soldiers united by a prophet. Even the Strategicon of Maurice, a manual of war praised for the variety of enemies it covers, does not mention warfare against Arabs at any length.|$|E

40|$|Several {{research}} studies suggest {{a link between}} parents’ emotion socialization and children’s social competence and behavior problems. Parents contribute <b>to</b> <b>their</b> children’s emotion socialization, more directly, through <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> children’s emotions. Early emotion socialization experiences with parents establish patterns of emotion experience, expression, and regulation that children carry into their broader social circles. Few scales exist <b>to</b> document parents’ <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> children’s emotions. The {{aim of this study}} was <b>to</b> document mothers’ <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> children’s sadness, anger, fear, and being overjoyed. A study sample of 868 mothers of preschoolers completed the questionnaire in Turkey. The validity and reliability properties of the <b>Responses</b> <b>to</b> Children’s Emotions (RCE) Questionnaire were also examined. We found that mothers in Turkey preferred to respond differently to children’s different emotions. Mothers’ responses generally did not differ according to the gender of their children; the only difference was found for sadness. Mothers’ <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> children’s emotions related to the children’s and mothers’ ages, monthly family income, levels of mothers’ education, mothers’ employment status, birth order of children, and the city they lived in. This study is important in that it is the first to document mothers’ emotion socialization strategies for their children in terms of one positive and three negative emotions. ...|$|R

5|$|These minks {{were large}} and heavily built, {{with a low}} {{sagittal}} crest and short, wide postorbital processes (projections on the frontal bone behind the eye sockets). In fact, the most notable characteristic of the skull was its size, {{in that it was}} clearly larger than that of other mink species, having a wide rostrum, large nostril openings, large antorbital fenestrae (openings in the skull in front of the eye socket), and large teeth. Their large size was probably in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> coastal environment, as the largest extant subspecies of American mink, the Alaskan mink (N. v. nesolestes), inhabits the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska, an area with a habitat similar to the Gulf of Maine. Mead, concluding that the mink was restricted to nearshore islands, suggested that the large size was due to insular gigantism. Since almost all members of the subfamily Mustelinae exhibit sexual dimorphism, male sea minks were probably larger than female sea minks. The sea mink's wider carnassial teeth and blunter carnassial blades suggest that they crushed hard shells more often than did the teeth of the American mink.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{existing}} research on factors which influence carers’ <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> challenging behaviour has focussed on paid staff and has largely ignored {{the experiences of}} family carers. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore family carers’ interpersonal perceptions and <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> relatives’ challenging behaviour. Method: Eight familial carers of adults with intellectual disabilities who engaged in frequent aggressive challenging behaviour were recruited. A semi-structured, interview was used to explore participants’ interpersonal perceptions and responses at the time of a recent incident of challenging behaviour. This was supplemented with a modified version of the Attributional Style Questionnaire and other rating scales. Results: Participants’ ratings on the quantitative measures did not match the responses they described experiencing during the interview. Findings from the interview suggest that the majority of participants experienced a range of emotions in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> incidents of challenging behaviour. A minority struggled to recall any emotional responses. Conflicting interpersonal appraisals were made by all participants and appear to have influenced both their emotional and behavioural <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> relative’s behaviour. Conclusions: It appears that family caregivers’ <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> relatives’ challenging behaviour were complex and, at times, contradictory. Their immediate emotional and behavioural responses during incidents of CB may have been influenced by their interpersonal perceptions made at the time of the incident and their underlying compassion for their relative.

40|$|The authors {{examined}} {{cultural differences}} in parents' <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> children's performance. In Study 1 (N = 421), Chinese 5 th graders {{reported that their}} parents de-emphasized their academic success and emphasized their academic failure, whereas their American counterparts reported that their parents did the opposite. This partially accounted for Chinese (vs. American) children responding less positively to success and more negatively to failure. In Study 2 (N = 128), Chinese and American mothers' <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> 4 th and 5 th graders' performance were observed in the laboratory. The cultural differences in children's reports of parents' responses documented in Study 1 were replicated; mothers' responses were also associated with children's subsequent performance. In addition, Chinese mothers were more involved than were American mothers, but their affect was similar.
