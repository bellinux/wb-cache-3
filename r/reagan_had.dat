5|$|Paul {{held one}} of his {{numerous}} press conferences in Helena, Montana, where he pushed for the Reagan administration {{to balance the budget}} and cut spending and taxes. He argued that <b>Reagan</b> <b>had</b> reneged on his 1980 campaign promise to balance the budget, resulting in voter dissatisfaction. Paul stated that Treasury Secretary James Baker should be removed from his office for the administration's monetary policy.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} President <b>Reagan</b> <b>had</b> given his first {{speech on the}} epidemic, some six years into his presidency, 36,058 Americans had been {{diagnosed}} with AIDS and 20,849 had died of it. By the end of 1989, the year Reagan left office, 115,786 people {{had been diagnosed with}} AIDS in the United States, and more than 70,000 of them had died of it. It has been suggested that far fewer would have died, both then and in the decades that followed, if the Reagan administration had applied the same determination in combatting AIDS as the Ford administration had applied to fighting Legionnaires' disease.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{staged a}} tiring, dangerous, and {{high-profile}} trip to South Africa in January 1985. He defied both the apartheid government's wishes and militant leftist AZAPO demonstrators by spending {{a night in}} the Soweto home of Bishop Desmond Tutu and also visited Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela. Upon returning, Kennedy became {{a leader in the}} push for economic sanctions against South Africa; collaborating with Senator Lowell Weicker, he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan's veto, of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. Despite their many political differences, Kennedy and <b>Reagan</b> <b>had</b> a good personal relationship, and with the administration's approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 to act as a go-between in arms control negotiations with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The discussions were productive, and Kennedy also helped gain the release of a number of Soviet Jewish refuseniks, including Anatoly Shcharansky.|$|E

5|$|When Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, he held an {{approval}} rating of sixty-eight percent, matching those of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and later Bill Clinton, {{as the highest}} ratings for departing presidents in the modern era. He was the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve two full terms, after a succession of five prior presidents did not, some under unusual circumstances. Although he had planned an active post-presidency, Reagan disclosed in 1994 {{that he had been}} diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier that year. He appeared publicly for the last time at the funeral of Richard Nixon. He died ten years later in 2004 at the age of 93. <b>Reagan</b> <b>had</b> the third-longest life out of all the presidents, after Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. An icon among Republicans, he is viewed favorably in historian rankings of U.S. presidents, and his tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, Reagan sealed up {{conservative}} support. Shell hesistated {{to support}} Reagan: he questioned Reagan's late conversion {{to the party}} {{and some of the}} leftist associations that Reagan maintained during the 1950s, when he had nevertheless supported Eisenhower for President. Reagan went on to secure the nomination by defeating former San Francisco Mayor George Christopher, a Greek American who had been Nixon's lieutenant governor running mate in 1962. Shell claimed that <b>Reagan</b> <b>had</b> earlier promised to support him for governor, an assertion that Reagan denied. Reagan financial backer Holmes Tuttle pleaded with Shell to support Reagan and offered him {{a leading role in the}} campaign, but Shell demurred.|$|E
25|$|By comparison, Bill Clinton {{only had}} one {{outstanding}} Cabinet confirmation {{at the end of}} his first day in office and George W. Bush had all but one approved before February 1, 2001. Ronald <b>Reagan</b> <b>had</b> twelve of thirteen Cabinet members confirmed before February 1, and Jimmy Carter had all eleven of his confirmed. George H. W. Bush only had seven of thirteen confirmed by this time. Whereas his predecessors had to trade favours for contentious approvals such as Zoe Baird (Clinton), John Tower (G.H.W. Bush), or John Ashcroft (G.W. Bush), Obama has largely focused on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a proposed economic stimulus package totalling nearly $1 trillion.|$|E

25|$|With the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Reagan and Congress {{sought to}} simplify the tax system by {{eliminating}} many deductions, reducing the highest marginal rates, and {{reducing the number of}} tax brackets. In 1983, Democrats Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt had offered a proposal; in 1984 <b>Reagan</b> <b>had</b> the Treasury Department produce its own plan. The eventual bipartisan 1986 act aimed to be revenue-neutral: while it reduced the top marginal rate, it also cleaned up the tax base by removing certain tax write-offs, preferences, and exceptions, thus raising the effective tax on activities previously specially favored by the code. Ultimately, the combination of the decrease in deductions and decrease in rates, raised revenue equal to about 4% of existing tax revenue.|$|E
25|$|It was the 1976 Republican Presidential {{race that}} may have {{cemented}} the tight political friendship between Laxalt and former Governor Reagan. <b>Reagan</b> <b>had</b> decided to challenge President Gerald Ford for the Republican nomination. Ford enjoyed widespread support among the GOP establishment, particularly in Washington, D.C. Reagan decided that having Laxalt serve as his national chairman would give his campaign credibility it was otherwise lacking. Although Laxalt was not well known on a national level, he was well liked and respected in the U.S. Congress, and he was similarly respected by many prominent {{members of the national}} media. Laxalt eventually acceded to Reagan's request, even though doing so severely jeopardized his relationship with the Ford White House. Laxalt campaigned all over the United States on behalf of Reagan, often campaigning by his side.|$|E
25|$|Ford {{chose to}} seek {{election}} {{to a full}} term in 1976, but first he had to counter a challenge for the Republican party nomination. The pardon of Nixon and the disastrous 1974 mid-term elections had weakened Ford's standing within the party, and Ford's other actions as president had alienated the conservative wing of the party. Conservative Republicans were disappointed with the selection of Rockefeller as vice president and faulted Ford for the Fall of Saigon, the amnesty for draft dodgers, and the continuation of détente policies, particularly {{with regards to the}} signing of the Helsinki Accords. Ronald Reagan, a leader among the conservatives, launched his campaign in autumn of 1975. Hoping to appease his party's right wing and sap Reagan's momentum, Ford requested that Rockefeller not seek re-election, and the vice president agreed to this request. Ford defeated Reagan in the first several primaries, but Reagan gained momentum after winning North Carolina's March 1976 primary. Entering the 1976 Republican National Convention, neither Ford nor <b>Reagan</b> <b>had</b> won a majority of delegates through the primaries, but Ford was able to win the support of enough unpledged delegates to win the presidential nomination. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas won the vice presidential nomination.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "tear {{down this}} wall" [...] speech {{was not the}} first time <b>Reagan</b> <b>had</b> {{addressed}} the issue of the Berlin Wall: in a visit to West Berlin in June 1982, he'd stated [...] "I'd like to ask the Soviet leaders one question [...] Why is the wall there?", and in 1986, 25 years after the construction of the wall, in response to West German newspaper Bild-Zeitung asking when he thought the wall could be [...] "torn down", Reagan said, [...] "I call upon those responsible to dismantle it [...] ".|$|E

500|$|The {{period of}} American history most {{dominated}} by Reagan and his policies concerning taxes, welfare, defense, {{the federal judiciary}} and the Cold War is known today as the Reagan Era, and emphasizes that the conservative [...] "Reagan Revolution," [...] led by <b>Reagan,</b> <b>had</b> a permanent impact on the United States in domestic and foreign policy. The Bill Clinton administration is often treated {{as an extension of}} the Reagan Era, as is the George W. Bush administration. Historian Eric Foner noted that the Obama candidacy in 2008 [...] "aroused a great deal of wishful thinking among those yearning for a change after nearly thirty years of Reaganism." ...|$|E
500|$|General Secretary Gorbachev said of {{his former}} rival's Cold War role: [...] " [...] {{a man who was}} {{instrumental}} in bringing {{about the end of the}} Cold War," [...] and deemed him [...] "a great president." [...] Gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war, but rather a peaceful end; he said he was not intimidated by Reagan's harsh rhetoric. Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, said of Reagan, [...] "he warned that the Soviet Union had an insatiable drive for military power... but he also sensed it was being eaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform." [...] She later said, [...] "Ronald <b>Reagan</b> <b>had</b> a higher claim than any other leader to have won the Cold War for liberty and he did it without a shot being fired." [...] Said Brian Mulroney, former Prime Minister of Canada: [...] "He enters history as a strong and dramatic player [...]" [...] Former President Lech Wałęsa of Poland acknowledged, [...] "Reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communism's collapse." [...] That <b>Reagan</b> <b>had</b> little or no effect in ending the Cold War is argued with equal weight; that Communism's internal weakness had become apparent, and the Soviet Union would have collapsed in the end regardless of who was in power. President Harry S. Truman's policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the USSR, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itself.|$|E
