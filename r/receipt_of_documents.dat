40|$|A diary study {{tracked the}} paper {{documents}} received by nine UK informants over one month. Informants gave simple ratings of individual documents’ attractiveness and {{the ease of}} understanding them; more detailed reactions to the documents were gathered through informant diaries and follow-up interviews. The detailed reactions extended beyond the feedback gathered through the rating task. Informants showed sensitivity to the content, language, design and circumstances of <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> with indications that they developed opinions of originating organizations based on their experience of using their documents. Documents that failed to provide all the information needed, that failed to make their intentions clear (or obscured their intentions) or that were perceived as miss-targeted received negative comment. Repeat experiences of receiving either well- or poorly-conceived documents strengthened informant reactions to individual originating organizations. The paper concludes with recommendations for steps document originators, writers and designers need to take to prepare documents that enhance organization to consumer communication. We recommend that organizations evaluate and act on consumers’ reactions to their documents, beyond user testing in document development or scorecard ratings in use...|$|E

Many of them were decidedly less pleased a week earlier to learn that members of the Metropolitan Police had also paid a visit to parliament, where they arrested the Tory frontbencher Damian Green and searched his parliamentary office, his constituency headquarters and his private residence. The police did so on suspicion that he was in <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> leaked from the immigration department by a relatively junior public servant. His arrest was not made under the Official Secrets Act but on a common law charge of “aiding and abetting misconduct in public office” and “conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office. ” The phrases may be redolent of Orwell’s 1984 but the offences carry a decidedly unfictional maximum sentence of life imprisonment [...] .

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "We found that while DOD has a process in place for monitoring and reporting on late-payment penalties, this process has significant flaws and omissions that result in incomplete and inaccurate data, thereby limiting {{the effectiveness of the}} process. Specifically, DODs performance measure, or metric, for late-payment penalties did not include about $ 54 billion of commercial payments subject to the Prompt Payment Act, and DOD did not assess the data for accuracy or completeness. In addition, at the time of our review, DOD was not monitoring or reporting on discounts lost across the department because, DOD officials stated, the metric had consistently met its goal. The deficiencies we found in DODs process for monitoring and reporting on late-payment penalties and discounts lost significantly increase the risk to the accuracy and completeness of reported data, thus preventing DOD officials and congressional oversight committees from obtaining the reliable and comprehensive data they need for assessing the extent of any issues concerning late-payment penalties and discounts lost across DOD. According to DOD officials and reports, a major contributor to late-payment penalties incurred and discounts lost was the late <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> necessary to validate receipt and acceptance of goods or services and make payments. We are recommending that DOD establish procedures for identifying all DOD systems that process commercial payments, validating completeness and accuracy of late-payment penalty metric data, and monitoring discounts lost. In commenting on a draft of our report, DOD concurred with our recommendations and cited planned corrective actions to address the issues that gave rise to our recommendations. ...|$|E

Increased Fall 2008 new freshmen by 10. 8 %. Increased Spring 2009 {{transfer}} students by 12. 6 %. Increased National Scholars from 14 in 2007 to 39 in 2008 and 73 in 2009 (92 % increase). Overall enrollment for Fall 2009 increased 5. 75 % including 5. 7 % for new freshmen, 30 % for new transfers with large growth in non-residents. • Expanded our communication capacity by purchasing Hobson's EMT E-Mail software {{that allows us to}} communicate more frequently and effectively with all students. A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution has also been purchased and will be automating communications in Fall 2009. • Developed email letterhead prototype for all enrollment units. • Re-engineered the admissions office to allow for more accountability and productivity of staff and service level. • Set service level expectations for admissions to two working days. We are now committed to communicating with students within two working days of <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents.</b> • Re-engineered the financial aid process and reduced the number of forms required. This resulted in 7, 000 less pieces of paper students had to submit and be processed. We no longer require verification of childcare expenses as we will be using average cost of child care. Driver's license number is no longer required for the F AFSA form. No forms needed for second bachelors degree as we can retrieve this information through Banner. No need for graduation date change form as it can be pulled from Banner. • Established a Communications Center that will handle all incoming calls for the entire division as well as provide telecounseling efforts in the evening. Additionally, the Center will house "Chat With Us" initiative allows students to engage with us by way of online chat. The result is phone calls answered in a timely manner and a student friendly virtual environment to conduct business. • Rolled out "How Can We Help You" campaign during Fall registration. This campaign is ongoing during every registration period where staff are deployed to assist students with their registration questions. All personnel involved with this campaign wear "How Can We Help You" stickers so that students know that we are there to assist them. • Initiated the first comprehensive recruitment plan for transfer students.

40|$|Bibliographically, {{document}} serials, do {{not differ}} substantially from other serials. Their acquisition is largely dependent upon the use of enumerative bibliographies which identify them; their use, upon the subject bibliographies which give some measure of control over their contents. Based on local requirements, every library has its own problems to consider storage, convenient availability, paper quality but bibliographic access is the common need that they all share. If libraries {{are willing to accept}} Osborn's definition that "on practical grounds a serial can be defined as any item which lends itself to serial treatment in a library," 1 then a great bulk <b>of</b> government <b>document</b> publication falls into the province of this conference. One reasonable estimate, based on a university library's <b>receipts</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> is that " 80 percent of the material published by the United States government is serial in nature. " 2 It is safe to assume that a comparable percentage pertains in most large libraries for state and foreign government acquisition. While today there are many bibliographic aids for serials and for documents that were not available a few years ago, the acquisition librarian's and the serial records librarian's approach to document serials whether for serial titles or for individual issues is often far from direct or automatic. Librarians are fortunate to have New Serial Titles from 1950, which gives far better coverage of state, federal, and foreign documents than the Union List Serials did, but as with any cooperative compilation, librarians must be grateful for what they find, and philosophic about what they do not find. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

The two charges they finally decided to bring related to his failure to attend the Subcommittee on Rules and Administration, which had called him to testify in 1951 and 1952, and his abuse of General Zwicker in the Army hearings of 1954.
