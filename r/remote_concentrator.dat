The interface between remote concentrators and telephone switches has been standardised by ETSI as the V5 protocol.

50|$|In modern {{telephony}} a <b>remote</b> <b>concentrator,</b> <b>remote</b> <b>concentrator</b> unit (RCU), or remote {{line concentrator}} (RLC) is a concentrator {{at the lowest}} level in the telephone switch hierarchy.|$|E
50|$|Only a {{few hundred}} {{telephone}} lines attach to each <b>remote</b> <b>concentrator.</b> In North America concentrators are located in a serving area interface (SAI) or other enclosure in each neighborhood. In Europe the buildings which once contained local Strowger switch telephone exchanges are now usually empty except for a <b>remote</b> <b>concentrator.</b>|$|E

50|$|SAIs {{are used}} in {{suburban}} and low-density urban areas, serving {{some of the same}} purposes that manholes do in high-density urban areas. Besides a cross connect point, they sometimes contain a DSLAM or more rarely a <b>remote</b> <b>concentrator</b> or both.|$|E
50|$|In telephony, a customer's {{telephone}} line now typically {{ends at the}} <b>remote</b> <b>concentrator</b> box, where it is multiplexed along with other {{telephone line}}s for that neighborhood or other similar area. The multiplexed signal is then carried to the central switching office on significantly fewer wires and for much further distances than a customer's line can practically go. This is likewise also true for digital subscriber lines (DSL).|$|E
50|$|Late in the 20th {{century the}} {{smallest}} offices {{were replaced by}} <b>remote</b> <b>concentrators</b> connected to a host office in an adjacent exchange area, which may be several miles away. Others were replaced with distributed switching hardware (a remote switching centre controlled by a digital switch in the city) or with small digital switches such as Nortel's DMS-10 (a self-contained exchange for up to 8000 subscribers).|$|R
50|$|The 80s were growth {{years for}} the Telecommunications Board despite the {{recession}} which hit the United Kingdom. Many new services were introduced during this time, the most significant {{of which was the}} introduction of System X exchanges island-wide. This computer-controlled system had been developed for British Telecom and had the obvious advantage of allowing Jersey to be completely compatible with the UK network. 1983 saw the 60,000th telephone connected in Jersey which showed a 20,000 increase in just 7 years. All exchanges were replaced with System X or System X <b>remote</b> <b>concentrators</b> by 1994.|$|R
50|$|In the {{evolution}} of modern telecommunications systems there was a requirement to connect large numbers of low-speed access devices with large telephone company 'central office' switches over common paths. During the first generations of digital networks, analog signals were digitized on line cards attached to the telephone exchange switches. In {{an effort to reduce}} local loop costs, it was decided to push this conversion closer to the customer premises by deploying small conversion devices in customer neighborhoods. These devices would combine multiple digital signals on a single link to a larger telephone switch, which would provide service to the customer. These devices were initially called <b>remote</b> <b>concentrators</b> or simply <b>remotes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the fixed}} {{telephone}} network, a node {{may be a}} public or private telephone exchange, a <b>remote</b> <b>concentrator</b> or a computer providing some intelligent network service. In cellular communication, switching points and databases such as the Base station controller, Home Location Register, Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) are examples of nodes. Cellular network base stations are {{not considered to be}} nodes in this context.|$|E

50|$|AXE10 covers {{two main}} types of digital {{telephony}} switching equipment: the remote subscriber switch (RSS) and the AXE10 local switch. RSS {{acts as a}} <b>remote</b> <b>concentrator</b> and deals with the conversion of analogue telephony signals used in the access network, which is the copper pairs between exchange buildings and customer premises, also called local loop, and the multiplexing of customer lines over cabling to the AXE10 local switching unit. The AXE10 local switch uses a processor-controlled switch to route calls and data depending on the destination of the telephony transmission.|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{sophisticated}} electronics {{in the early part}} of the 1990s, telephone service providers developed methods to share a single copper line to transmit multiple telephone calls simultaneously. Various pair gain methods using time-division multiplexing and frequency-division multiplexing prevented interference between simultaneous calls. A distant suburb may have a subscriber loop carrier or digital loop carrier system in which a <b>remote</b> <b>concentrator</b> is located near the subscribers to connect multiple local subscriber loops to one common line to a central office exchange. A single optical fibre can also be shared between multiple subscribers in fibre to the cabinet systems.|$|E
50|$|In most areas, one carrier held a {{monopoly}} on local service. The landline telephone system was originally constructed in an era before transistorisation, remote concentrators or cabinetisation. Individual lines from subscribers ran not to a <b>remote</b> <b>concentrator</b> but directly to the nearest village community dial office, to be terminated at an automated mechanical switch or manual exchange. To keep subscriber loop wiring requirements manageable, local exchanges were built in each tiny hamlet. Rural subscribers often made do with party line service. Each village was a separate rate center for long-distance calls and each had its own block of ten thousand numbers (the largest that reasonably could fit on a small-town manual cord switchboard with a jack and indicator for each line). In most small villages, many of these numbers would remain unused. In large cities, multiple exchanges were created to cover individual districts or neighbourhoods; each had its own series of distinctive prefixes, and multiple blocks of ten thousand numbers each. The first few digits of a number uniquely identified a village, a town or a neighbourhood of a big city.|$|E
40|$|Configurations and Software: A Tutorial This paper, {{together}} with the preceding paper by Divilbiss, is intended to provide a background for the characteristics of minicomputers {{and the ways in}} which they can be configured to tackle library problems. As part of the discussion of minicomputer features, an attempt is made to compare and contrast them with larger, general purpose computers. An acquaintance with basic computer concepts is assumed. Concepts of a more technical nature are explained as they are introduced. The first section below discusses configurations; the second section covers minicomputer software. Hardware and architectural features are covered in the paper by Divilbiss. MINICOMPUTER CONFIGURATIONS Minicomputers and their associated peripheral devices can be combined in a great variety of ways, but this variety can be categorized into four basic configuration types: (1) stand-alone batch, (2) stand-alone on-line, (3) front end, and (4) <b>remote</b> <b>concentrator.</b> The first type, stand-alone batch, is the most familiar (see figure 1). In this configuration, the mini looks like and performs like larger batch computers. In most cases the mini will have a card reader and punch, a line printer, tape drives and disks. (The minis in all four configuration types will have operator consoles, but to avoid cluttering the figures, the consoles have been omitted.) The term stand-alone is part of the name of this configuration in order to stress the fact that the mini is not connected to a larger computer. The mini stands alone. The main use of the stand-alone batch configuration is the generation of printed products, e. g., serials lists, purchase orders, circulation lists and overdue notices. This configuration could also be used fo...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{personal}} handyphone system (PHS) service {{began in}} Japan in 1995. As this new communication service matched social needs well, {{the number of}} subscribers quickly reached 7 million in just two years. The changes of the social needs for telephone services progressed {{from the age of}} “phones to more homes ” to one of “a phone for each person. ” This means that we have entered the age of personal communication. In addition, a user’s needs for anytime, anywhere voice and data communication have also increased recently. Against the backdrop of this, the recent immense strides in multimedia, mobile switching and radio communication technologies are attracting attention for the implementation of personal land mobile communications. Hitachi Ltd. ’s main components of the PHS network including: the PHS switching system, high-efficiency <b>remote</b> line <b>concentrator,</b> cell station (CS), and CS maintenance system are introduced...|$|R
50|$|These {{front-end}} processors, usually DEC PDP-8, PDP-11, or LSI-11 based with locally developed custom {{hardware and}} software, {{would act as}} IBM control units attached to the IBM input/output channels {{on one side and}} to modems and phone lines on the other. At the University of Michigan the front-end processor was known as the Data Concentrator (DC). The DC was developed as part of the CONCOMP project by Dave Mills and others and was the first non-IBM device developed for attachment to an IBM I/O Channel. Initially a PDP-8 based system, the DC was upgraded to use PDP-11 hardware and a <b>Remote</b> Data <b>Concentrator</b> (RDC) was developed that used LSI-11 hardware that connected back to a DC over a synchronous data circuit. The University of British Columbia (UBC) developed two PDP-11 based systems: the Host Interface Machine (HIM) and the Network Interface Machine (NIM). The University of Alberta used a PDP-11 based Front-end processor.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity and}} heterogeneity of avionic networks make resource savings a challenging task to guarantee easy incremental design {{during the long}} lifetime of an aircraft. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} optimization of interconnection devices for multi-cluster avionic networks, called <b>Remote</b> Data <b>Concentrators</b> (RDC), and especially for the CAN-AFDX network. The design of this optimized RDC device consists in implementing frame packing strategies to manage upstream (sensors) flows to improve bandwidth utilization in the AFDX; and Hierarchical Traffic Shaping (HTS) algorithm to control downstream (actuators) flows to guarantee bandwidth isolation on CAN. Schedulability analysis integrating the effects of these new mechanisms is detailed and validated. Furthermore, a heuristic approach to tune the Hierarchical Traffic Shaping parameters within the RDC device is proposed to reduce as much as possible bandwidth utilization in the AFDX, while ensuring flows schedulability. The performance analysis conducted on a realistic avionic case study proves the efficiency of the optimized RDC device to reduce bandwidth utilization in the AFDX, compared to the basic device currently implemented in avionics...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} {{is to provide}} a resources-efficient gateway to connect Input/Output (I/O) CAN buses to a {{backbone}} network based on AFDX technology, in modern avionics communication architectures. Currently, the <b>Remote</b> Data <b>Concentrator</b> (RDC) is the main standard for gateways in avionics; and the existing implementations do not integrate any resource management mechanism. To handle these limitations, we design an enhanced CAN-AFDX RDC integrating new functions: (i) Frame Packing (FP) allowing to reduce communication overheads with reference to the currently used " 1 to 1 " frame conversion strategy; (ii) Hierarchical Traffic Shaping (HTS) to reduce contention on the CAN bus. Furthermore, our proposed RDC allows the connection of multiple I/O CAN buses to AFDX while guaranteeing isolation between different criticality levels, using a software partitioning mechanism. To analyze the performance guarantees offered by our proposed RDC, we considered two metrics: the end-to-end latency and the induced AFDX bandwidth consumption. Furthermore, an optimization process was proposed to achieve an optimal configuration of our proposed RDC, i. e., minimizing the bandwidth utilization while meeting the real-time constraints of communication. Finally, the capacity of our proposed RDC to meet the emerging avionics requirements has been validated through a realistic avionics case study...|$|R
