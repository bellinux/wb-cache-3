40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms whereby caveolae exert {{control over}} cellular signaling have to date remained elusive. We have therefore explored the role caveolae play in modulating Ras signaling. Lipidomic and gene array {{analyses revealed that}} caveolin- 1 (CAV 1) deficiency results in altered cellular lipid composition, and plasma membrane (PM) phosphatidylserine distribution. These changes correlated with increased K-Ras expression and extensive isoform-specific perturbation of Ras spatial organization: in CAV 1 -deficient cells K-RasG 12 V nanoclustering and MAPK activation were enhanced, whereas GTP-dependent lateral segregation of H-Ras was abolished resulting in compromised signal output from H-RasG 12 V nanoclusters. These changes in Ras nanoclustering were phenocopied by the down-regulation of Cavin 1, another crucial caveolar structural component, and by acute loss of caveolae in response to increased osmotic pressure. Thus, we postulate that caveolae <b>remotely</b> <b>regulate</b> Ras nanoclustering and signal transduction by controlling PM organization. Similarly, caveolae transduce mechanical stress into PM lipid alterations that, in turn, modulate Ras PM organization...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe insulin-like peptide (ILP) family plays key {{biological}} {{roles in}} the control of body growth. Although the functions of ILPs are well understood, the mechanisms by which organisms sense their nutrient status and thereby control ILP production remain largely unknown. Here, we show that signaling relay and feedback mechanisms control the nutrient-dependent expression of Drosophila ILP 5 (Dilp 5). The expression of dilp 5 in brain insulin-producing cells (IPCs) is negatively regulated by the transcription factor FoxO. Glia-derived Dilp 6 <b>remotely</b> <b>regulates</b> the FoxO activity in IPCs, primarily through Jeb secreted by cholinergic neurons. Dilp 6 production by surface glia is amplified by cellular response to circulating Dilps derived from IPCs, in concert with amino acid signals. The induction of dilp 5 is critical for sustaining body growth under restricted food conditions. These results provide a molecular framework that explains how the production of an endocrine hormone in a specific tissue is coordinated with environmental conditions...|$|R

Here, we present a capsule-based delivery system capable of rapidly releasing multiple payloads in response to ultrasonic signals. In vitro, these alginate capsules exhibited excellent payload retention for up to 1 week when unstimulated and delivered their entire payloads when ultrasonically stimulated for 10 - 100 s. Shorter exposures (10 s) were required to trigger delivery from capsules embedded in hydrogels placed in a tissue model and {{did not result in}} tissue heating or death of encapsulated cells.

40|$|We {{statistically}} investigated winter-summer climatic connectivity {{between the}} winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), {{and the summer}} Okhotsk High. We found that the winter NAO persistently influen-ces the surface air temperature, snow cover over the Eurasia continent, sea ice and SST around the Barents Sea region from winter to summer. The warm air temperature anomalies in East Siberia make a preferable condition for upper-level blocking. Warm signals around the Barents Sea region excite the Rossby wave propagating toward the Sea of Okhotsk. In addition, regional persistency of the wintertime local phenomena, and their possible influence on the summertime Okhotsk High is examined. The neg-ative phase of the winter NAO {{is related to the}} winter and spring heavy sea ice in the Sea of Okhotsk. The heavy spring sea ice in the Sea of Okhotsk brings about the cold SST around the Sea of Okhotsk. However, since the Okhotsk High does not have correlation with the SST around the Sea of Okhotsk in the previous month, the local connection of the sea ice in the Sea of Okhotsk with the summer Okhotsk High is unlikely. Associated with an enhanced Okhotsk High, cold SST anomalies appear to the east of Japan. This cold SST anomaly is a response to the cold air advection associated with the Okhotsk High.

40|$|AbstractRetinoic acid (RA) {{signaling}} {{plays an}} important role in determining the anterior boundary of Hox gene expression in the neural tube during embryogenesis. In particular, RA signaling is implicated in a rostral expansion of the neural expression domain of 5 ׳ Hoxb genes (Hoxb 9 –Hoxb 5) in mice. However, underlying mechanisms for this gene regulation have remained elusive due to the lack of RA responsive element (RARE) in the 5 ׳ half of the HoxB cluster. To identify cis-regulatory elements required for the rostral expansion, we developed a recombineering technology to serially label multiple genes with different reporters in a single bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector containing the mouse HoxB cluster. This allowed us to simultaneously monitor the expression of multiple genes. In contrast to plasmid-based reporters, transgenic BAC reporters faithfully recapitulated endogenous gene expression patterns of the Hoxb genes including the rostral expansion. Combined inactivation of two RAREs, DE-RARE and ENE-RARE, in the BAC completely abolished the rostral expansion of the 5 ׳ Hoxb genes. Knock-out of endogenous DE-RARE lead to significantly reduced expression of multiple Hoxb genes and attenuated Hox gene response to exogenous RA treatment in utero. Regulatory potential of DE-RARE was further demonstrated by its ability to anteriorize 5 ׳ Hoxa gene expression in the neural tube when inserted into a HoxA BAC reporter. Our data demonstrate that multiple RAREs cooperate to <b>remotely</b> <b>regulate</b> 5 ׳ Hoxb genes during CNS development, providing a new insight into the mechanisms for gene regulation within the Hox clusters...|$|R
40|$|Enhancer dysfunction: how {{the main}} {{regulators}} of gene expression contribute to cancer Siavash K Kurdistani* A genome-wide epigenetic analysis of enhancer elements in colon cancer has implicated distal gene regulatory DNA sequences {{in the establishment}} of an oncogenic transcriptional program. What determines the phenotypic identity of a cell is the expression of a particular set of genes in space and time. Such selective gene expression patterns are achieved through highly choreographed interactions between various DNA elements and several multi-protein complexes. The principle DNA elements responsible for cell type-specific gene expression are the enhancer sequences. A recent study [1] now reveals that cancer cells exploit enhancers to reprogram global gene expression in their favor. Enhancers as distal gene regulatory elements Enhancers are short DNA sequences with binding sites for several transcription factors that are largely responsible for specificity of gene expression patterns in a given cell. First discovered through studies of the simian virus 40 (SV 40) genome [2], enhancers can <b>remotely</b> <b>regulate</b> transcription from thousands of base pairs away in either direction or orientation relative to their target genes. Although these molecular characteristics define enhancer function, enhancer elements can also be identified by specific features of the chromatin in which they are embedded. These include variations in chromatin compaction, which can be monitored by enzymes that digest the DNA (such as DNase I), and combinations of histone modifications, such as histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H 3 K 4 me 1), a seemingly ubiquitous marker of enhancers, and more specific acetylation (ac) an...|$|R

One of the major challenges in Internet-based control systems is how to overcome the Internet transmission delay. In this paper, we investigate the potential of using the multirate control scheme and the time-delay compensation to overcome the Internet transmission delay. A two-level hierarchy is used for the Internet-based control systems. At the lower level, a local controller is implemented to control the plant at a higher frequency. At the higher level, a remote controller is employed to <b>remotely</b> <b>regulate</b> the desirable set-point at a lower frequency for the local controller. A compensator located at the feedback channel is designed to overcome the time delay occurring in the transmission from the local site to a remote site. Another compensator in the feedforward channel is designed to compensate the time-delay occurring in the control action transmission. The simulation and experimental application results illustrate that the multirate control scheme with the time delay compensation offers a promising way to efficiently reduce the effect of Internet time delay on control performance...|$|R

40|$|The years {{following}} World War II brought new broadcasting stations to a divided Germany, government <b>regulated</b> radio <b>stations</b> in the East and state <b>regulated</b> <b>stations</b> in the West. Radio broadcasts were a significant cultural {{source for the}} Germans in times of reconstruction. Broadcasting stations played much of the familiar Tanz- und Unterhaltungsmusik, reminiscent of earlier times of happiness and prosperity. However, with changes in a new generation’s musical tastes the demand for swing bands declined. Radio stations began to rework their in-house “dance bands” into “jazz bands. ” The West Deutscher Rundfunk (WDR), and other broadcast stations, employed jazz musicians full-time. This thesis investigates {{the development of the}} WDR Big Band as follows: Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the state of jazz and swing music at the end of World War II in Germany. Chapter 2 examines the decline in popularity of swing bands after World War II in Germany and its causes. It examines the transitional years from “dance bands” into “big bands” by studying the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR) dance band in Cologne. These changes lay the path for the change to “big bands” during the 1960 ’s. The final chapter presents an analysis of the stylistic changes that the KTUO band made to transform into a big band during the 1960 ’s. It will touch on the collaboration between the KTUO band and the WDR broadcasting station and will then examine {{the early years of the}} new WDR Big Band. I will consider personnel choices and stylistic practices of the WDR Big Band. Further, I will study the later years of the WDR Big Band to the present, including changes in direction and collaborations with American artists.
