40|$|We study {{a notion}} of translatability between classes of schemas when {{restrictions}} are placed <b>on</b> <b>interpretations.</b> Unlike the usual notion of translatability, our translatability lets the translation depend <b>on</b> the <b>interpretation.</b> We consider five classes of schemas. Three of these have been extensively studied in the literature: flow-chart, flow-chart with counters, and recursive. The two others are defined herein; {{the first of which}} is a class of “maximal power” and is equivalent to similarly motivated classes of other investigators; while the second is, in some sense, a nontrivial class of “minimal power”. Our main results specify restrictions <b>on</b> <b>interpretations</b> that will allow the translatability of a class into a class, not being translatable into over all (or unrestricted) interpretations. Additional results specify restrictions <b>on</b> <b>interpretations</b> under which is not translatable into; the proofs of these clarify the mechanisms in the main results. Last, we consider the notion of effective computability in algebraic structures {{in the light of the}} main results...|$|R
