500|$|Freight {{transport}} by motor vehicles, {{commonly called}} [...] "motor transport" [...] by the Soviet authorities, {{due to the}} underdeveloped nature of the nation's road network, was of considerable significance to {{certain areas of the}} economy. In the 1980s, there were 13 million laborers employed in the transport sector. Of those, about 8.5 million were employed in motor transport. Inter-city freight transport remained underdeveloped during the whole Soviet epoch, with it constituting less than 1 percent of the motor-borne freight average. These developments can again be blamed on cost and administrative inefficiencies. Road transport as a whole lagged far behind that of rail transport; the average distance moved by motor transport in 1982 was , while the average for railway transport was 930km per ton and 435km per ton for water freight. In 1982 there was a threefold increase in investment since 1960 in motor freight transport, and more than a thirtyfold increase since 1940. Inter-city transport and the volume of <b>road</b> <b>freight</b> <b>transport</b> had also increased significantly. Motor transport was much cheaper and flexible over short distances (defined as less than 200km) than rail transport. There were many Soviet economists who argued that transferring some 100 million tons from the railways to road transport would save up to 120 million rubles. But in 1975, road transport was ...|$|E

40|$|The {{increase}} in the number of freight vehicles on South Africa’s rural road network has received substantial attention. Insinuations persist that long-distance <b>road</b> <b>freight</b> haulage is of a somewhat unsavoury economic nature, and that strict economic re-regulation of the land <b>freight</b> <b>transport</b> is necessary. During the 1970 s road transport replaced rail carriage as the dominant form of long-distance <b>freight</b> <b>transport</b> (excluding minerals and ore) in South Africa. On long hauls <b>road</b> <b>freight</b> carriers <b>transport</b> certain primary products of an organic nature (such as timber, fish and agricultural produce), some semi-finished goods, many finished goods and most consumer goods. <b>Road</b> <b>freight</b> carriers are continuously gaining market share on long-distance links where rail transport is the more cost efficient mode. The greater value added by <b>road</b> <b>freight</b> carriers in comparison with rail transport through service effectiveness is often more than the cost premium paid for utilising their service rather than making use of rail transport. Throughout history, governments have involved themselves in transport. A diverse range of arguments have been advanced for this involvement in transport, including the following: Control of excessive competition, co-ordination of transport, integration of transport with economic policy, maintenance of safety, security, and order, provision of costly infrastructure, provision of public goods, recovery of the true resource cost of transport inputs, regulation of harmful conduct and externalities, restraint of monopoly power, and social support. A set of nine instruments can be identified that governments apply to influence the performance of the <b>freight</b> <b>transport</b> industry: Legislation, direct supply, fiscal measures, monetary measures, moral appeal and persuasion, policies relating to strategic commodities, procurement policy, provision of information, and research and development.
