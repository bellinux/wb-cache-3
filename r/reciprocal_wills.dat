Some ratios are usually quoted as percentages, especially ratios that are usually or always less than 1, such as earnings yield, while others are usually quoted as decimal numbers, especially ratios that are usually more than 1, such as P/E ratio; these latter are also called multiples. Given any ratio, one can take its reciprocal; if the ratio was above 1, the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>will</b> be below 1, and conversely. The reciprocal expresses the same information, but may be more understandable: for instance, the earnings yield can be compared with bond yields, while the P/E ratio cannot be: for example, a P/E ratio of 20 corresponds to an earnings yield of 5%.|$|R

Furthermore we collect additional information that allows us to control for the workers’ ability and whether they can be classified as reciprocal or not.

It is shown {{that the members of}} a <b>reciprocal</b> swarm <b>will</b> aggregate and eventually form a cohesive cluster of finite size around the swarm center within finite time. Under mild conditions on attraction and repulsion functions, the swarm is also completely stable, i. e., every motion converges to the equilibrium point set of the system. These results are further extended to a class of nonreciprocal swarms under the detailed balance condition on coupling weights. We also present numerical simulations demonstrating complex oscillatory behavior in general non-reciprocal swarms. These results provide more insight into the effect of the interaction pattern on collective behavior of swarms.

Country risk is reduced relative to risk under international cap-and-trade since carbon revenues stay within the country.

40|$|In this article, some {{views on}} the nature of {{incoherent}} interphase interfaces, and their role in the nucleation and growth processes governing the evolution of microstructure in solid-state diffusional transformations (reconstructive transformations), are explored. It is argued that essentially incoherent interfaces can be involved in the initiation and propagation of polymorphic transformations and massive transformations as well as in various precipitation phenomena in metallic and ceramic systems. Similar views have already been advanced earlier in connection with studies of massive transformations. Faceting along the interphase interface during nucleation and growth can derive from thermodynamic, kinetic, and crystallographic factors independent of the bicrystallography of the conjugate phases. This idiomorphic behavior can be relevant to both intergranular and intragranular phase formation. The concept of one-dimensional (1 -D) commensuration of phases through plane edge-to-edge/row matching is an interesting extension of the classic ideas of coherency and bicrystallography and potentially important in characterizing the behavior of certain types of boundaries. However, the general importance of these geometrical relations in real and <b>reciprocal</b> space <b>will</b> depend on the depth of the energy wells in orientation space associated with these special boundaries.

40|$|Reciprocal altruism, one of {{the most}} {{probable}} explanations for cooperation among non-kin, has been modelled as a Prisoner's Dilemma. According to this game, cooperation could evolve when individuals, who expect to play again, use conditional strategies like tit-for-tat or Pavlov. There is evidence that humans use such strategies to achieve mutual cooperation, but most controlled experiments with non-human animals have failed to find cooperation. One reason for this could be that subjects fail to cooperate because they behave as if they were to play only once. To assess this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment with monogamous zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) that were tested in a two-choice apparatus, with either their social partner or an experimental opponent of the opposite sex. We found that zebra finches maintained high levels of cooperation in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game only when interacting with their social partner. Although other mechanisms {{may have contributed to the}} observed difference between the two treatments, our results support the hypothesis that animals do not systematically give in to the short-term temptation of cheating when long-term benefits exist.

These finding indicate that systems incapable of <b>reciprocal</b> sign epistasis <b>will</b> always possess a single fitness peak.
