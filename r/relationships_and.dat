40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{examined}} the correlations between victim/offender <b>relationship</b> <b>and</b> three variables: motive, weapon choice, and number of injuries inflicted. Empirical <b>relationship</b> <b>and</b> motive categories were used. The sample consisted of 57 intentional homicide cases from Florida Medical Examiner District 8 between the years 1992 <b>and</b> 1996. <b>Relationships</b> were divided into primary and secondary categories. Primary relationships included intimates, relatives, <b>and</b> friends; secondary <b>relationships</b> included acquaintances <b>and</b> strangers. Motives were classified as romantic dispute, argument/conflict, revenge, or felony type; weapons as firearm or contact; and number of injuries inflicted as single or multiple. A significant correlation was found between victim/offender <b>relationship</b> <b>and</b> homicide motive; however, the revenge and felony type motive categories did not differ. Unexpectedly, no correlation was found between victim/offender <b>relationship</b> <b>and</b> either weapon choice or number of injuries inflicted. Further study is needed of the interactions between homicide victim/offender <b>relationship</b> <b>and</b> motive, weapon selection, and number of injuries inflicted...|$|R
