5|$|A 1960s hairstyle, the beehive, is {{also called}} a B-52 for its <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's {{distinctive}} nose. The popular band the B-52's was subsequently named after this hairstyle.|$|E
5|$|Caloscypha fulgens bears some <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> orange-peel fungus (Aleuria aurantia); however, A.aurantia {{does not}} have the {{characteristic}} bluing reaction upon bruising or with age, and it fruits later in the season (usually in autumn).|$|E
5|$|The first {{full-length}} {{version was}} Murders in the Rue Morgue by Universal Pictures in 1932, directed by Robert Florey and starring Bela Lugosi, Leon Ames and Sidney Fox, with Arlene Francis. The film bears little <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original story.|$|E

5|$|This {{film was}} the third one to bear <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> novella, the other two being its 1953 namesake film and the 1976 film, Sankoch.|$|E
5|$|A study, using stuffed bird models, {{found that}} small birds {{are less likely}} to {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Eurasian reed warblers were found to be more aggressive to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that the <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hawk helps the cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts.|$|E
5|$|Amanita australis {{mushrooms}} {{that have}} lost their warts and have had the colours faded may resemble another New Zealand species, A.nothofagi. The two species may be distinguished reliably using microscopy—A.nothofagi does not have clamp connections {{at the base of}} the basidia, unlike A.australis.A.australis also bears some <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eastern North American and east Asian species A.abrupta, which also has an abruptly bulbous stem base.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues identified the tooth as a mammal; although some non-mammalian groups, like crocodylians, may have complex teeth, none approach the level of complexity seen in LACM 149371. They could find no <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> australosphenidans including monotremes, metatherians including marsupials, xenarthrans, and some related groups. They did see some general <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper premolars of the early South American ungulates, but the cusp arrangement is different from that of any ungulate. There are also some <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early rodents Ivanantonia from Asia and Nonomys from North America, but Ivanantonia has a central groove and lacks fossae, and Nonomys has a prominent cingulum (shelf) {{at the edges of the}} tooth and also lacks the fossae of LACM 149371.|$|R
50|$|If V.V. is {{afflicted by}} {{feelings}} {{of being the}} double of another Nabokovian persona, this is because he bears in fact significant <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main character of the novel The Real Life of Sebastian Knight from 1941.|$|R
50|$|He bears {{a passing}} <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> Vash <b>the</b> Stampede, of Nightow's earlier work Trigun.|$|R
5|$|Australian robins are a {{group of}} small insectivorous birds, whose exact {{position}} in the bird family tree is unclear. Named after a superficial <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> European robin, the males of many species sport bright red or pink on their plumage. Four species are found in Tasmania, of which one is endemic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the era of}} the {{influential}} linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary. Although onomatopoeia is a clear exception, since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sounds that they mimic, the Saussurean approach was to treat these as marginal exceptions. ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges this theory.|$|E
5|$|Mycena granulifera, {{a species}} {{originally}} described from Brazil, {{is comparable to}} M.nidificata in having inamyloid spores, club-shaped cheilocystidia with finger-like outgrowths, and diverticulate cap cuticle hyphae. M.granulifera differs in forming a whitish, wrinkled cap and club-shaped to roughly spindle-shaped pleurocystidia. Mycena nidificata also bears some <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> European species M.flos-nivium, which is distinguished by having cylindrical, amyloid spores, gills without veins between them, and an absence of cord-like rhizomorphs.|$|E
50|$|The Cathedral of Ávila is {{considered}} by its age (12th century), along with the Cathedral of Cuenca, as the first two Gothic cathedrals in Spain. It shows French influences and great <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Abbey Church of St Denis, the first European Gothic church.|$|R
25|$|Whether any of {{the above}} has a basis in fact, The Kybalion bears notable {{structural}} <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Arcane Teachings, an anonymous set of six books attributed to Atkinson. A full description of the similarities between the two works {{can be found on the}} Kybalion page.|$|R
25|$|Ford's next model Falcon, the XD (Project Blackwood), {{introduced}} in 1979, bore many external styling <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> European Ford Granada, but was slightly larger and less luxurious. Improved body reinforcing allowed many reductions in component weight to be made, improving performance and braking. The Fairmont Ghia replaced the Fairmont GXL.|$|R
5|$|Several {{scholars}} have recognised {{parallels between the}} philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato {{and that of the}} Upanishads, including their ideas on sources of knowledge, concept of justice and path to salvation, and Plato's allegory of the cave. Platonic psychology with its divisions of reason, spirit and appetite, also bears <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> three gunas in the Indian philosophy of Samkhya.|$|E
5|$|Tafl seems also to {{have been}} the basis for other modern board games that bear {{significant}} <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> historical games, but with some important differences. Games in this style feature a similar but diverge from the classic 2:1 attacker/defender ratio. This has an important impact on gameplay and tactics.|$|E
5|$|The Lutheran {{calendar}} is most {{similar to}} the calendar of The Episcopal Church and thus to the Anglican Calendar of Saints, though it also bears <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Roman Calendar of Saints because it commemorates {{many of the same}} individuals. However, the Lutheran calendar differs from both in two very significant ways, aside from its emphasis on commemorating persons important to the Lutheran tradition.|$|E
50|$|Culturally present-day Novaria bears <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eras of both Classical Greece {{and late}} Medieval Europe (Italy in particular), {{especially}} in conveying the vivid {{life of a}} cluster of city states sharing a common language and culture, though widely different in political regime and often at war with each other.|$|R
50|$|Apuli has clear <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> Apulia, <b>the</b> ancient southeastern Italy region, {{which is}} {{believed}} to have been settled by Illyrian tribes (also named Apuli or Iapyges).|$|R
50|$|The Clash Drummer Topper Headon, {{real name}} Nicholas Bowen Headon, earned his {{nickname}} from the band's guitarist Mick Jones due <b>to</b> his <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> Mickey <b>the</b> Monkey.|$|R
5|$|The {{architecture}} of Madagascar {{is unique in}} Africa, bearing strong <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> construction norms and methods of Southern Borneo from which the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar {{are believed to have}} immigrated. Throughout Madagascar and the Kalimantan region of Borneo, most traditional houses follow a rectangular rather than round form, and feature a steeply sloped, peaked roof supported by a central pillar.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{accounts}} of ancient breeds of piebald sheep {{is the story}} of Jacob from the first book of the Hebrew Bible, called by Christians the Old Testament. According to the Book of Genesis (Genesis 30:3143), Jacob took every speckled and spotted sheep from his father-in-law's (Laban's) flock and bred them. Due to the <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> animal described in Genesis, the Jacob sheep was named for the Biblical figure of Jacob sometime in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Ascocoryne cylichnium, {{another small}} and {{gelatinous}} violet-colored species, has apothecia {{that are more}} often cup-shaped, and has larger spores—20–24 by 5.5–6µm. Because of its <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jelly fungi, A.sarcoides has been mistaken for the basidiomycete species Auricularia auricula and Tremella foliacea. T.foliacea is larger, brown, and leafy in appearance. Auricularia auricula is also larger, typically brown, is disc- or ear-shaped, with a ribbed undersurface. Microscopically, Tremella foliacea and Auricularia auricula are easily distinguished from A.sarcoides {{by the presence of}} basidia (rather than asci).|$|E
25|$|The D.332 was {{developed}} {{based on the}} original D.33. A single-spar cantilever low-wing monoplane, the D.332 had fundamental <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original design. Able to hold a total of eight passengers, the D.332 had a small, enclosed cockpit, with an aerodynamic design and a rigid undercarriage. It was constructed purely from metal, and was built approximately {{three years after the}} original D.33 model, in 1933.|$|R
500|$|On {{the release}} of Bound, the Wachowskis were {{compared}} by many <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Coen Brothers. Rita Kempley for The Washington Post {{went so far as}} to call them [...] "Coen Brothers clones". In particular, similarities were drawn between Bound and the Coen Brothers' first film, 1984 neo-noir Blood Simple. Bryant Frazer for Deep Focus called it an [...] "obvious precursor". Critics noted <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> films of Quentin Tarantino and Alfred Hitchcock.|$|R
40|$|In Ben Jonson 2 ̆ 7 s Bartholomew Fair, Wasp, Busy and Overdo who {{represent}} some authoritymust undergo hardships through the fair and surrender their authoritative attitudes. In this paper I specify {{the meaning of}} their ordeals by examining their <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rites of passages. Then in this anthoropological approach I identify Jonson 2 ̆ 7 s vision of the free and equal relationship between men, which {{is the core of}} this comedy...|$|R
5|$|Beyond {{the area}} of Roman occupation, {{in the west and}} north, there are over 60 sites {{identified}} of wheelhouses. Perhaps a development of earlier Atlantic roundhouses, these have a characteristic outer wall surrounding a circle of stone piers (bearing a <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spokes of a wheel). Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although few have been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the north}} tower and the south tower of the Rincon Hill complex bear a <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Heritage at Millennium Park in Chicago, a {{building}} of a similar height to the south tower also designed by Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates. The architectural style for both buildings of the Rincon Hill complex is late-modernist. The three sides of the South Tower facing southeast, northeast, and northwest have a linear glass curtainwall. The North Tower has a similar design, except it is shorter and the curved aluminum and glass side faces northeast. Both skyscrapers of the Rincon Hill project contain an oval-shaped crown housing mechanical equipment.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's {{influence}} is marked {{in the first}} two pieces. Orledge observes that the right-hand figuration at the end of No 1 is remarkably similar to {{that at the end of}} Chopin's Waltz in E minor. In No 2 Nectoux detects the additional influence of Liszt (Au bord d'une source) in the opening bars. In the closing bars of No 2, Orledge finds a <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of Chopin's Grande Valse Brillante, Op, 18.|$|E
50|$|Hypoxanthine {{is also a}} {{spontaneous}} deamination product of adenine. Because of its <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> guanine, <b>the</b> spontaneous deamination of adenine can lead to an error in DNA transcription/replication, as it binds with cytosine.|$|R
50|$|The Dongola or Dongolawi is a {{riding horse}} native to Cameroon and to western Eritrea and Sudan. Although its name suggests, {{it does not}} {{originate}} from the Dongola region. It is strongly linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Barb horse and also bears <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Arab horse and {{is estimated to be}} partly descended from the Iberian horse during the 13th century. Many sub-breeds and crossbreeds are recognized across western Africa, many of them are small, resembling the Poney Mousseye.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Dijkstra’s {{concept of}} {{self-stabilization}} assumes that faults can only affect {{the variables of}} a program. We study the notion of selfstabilization if faults can also affect (i. e., augment) the program code of a system. A code stabilizing system automatically recovers from (almost) arbitrary perturbations of its program code. We prove some lower bounds for code stabilizing systems and argue that code stabilization has many <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area of integrity management {{in the domain of}} security. ...|$|R
