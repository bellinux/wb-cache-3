Tillage tool attachment systems must be designed to determine a tool's maximum depth into the soil and withstand the resulting forces from the soil. The following paper presents a design for an attachment system that incorporates a self-locking <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>jack,</b> load-bearing sliding surfaces, and rack clamp that is used to secure the cultivator sweep. The design is evaluated for deformation and deflection at the maximum theoretical loads using Finite Element Analysis. The design successfully minimizes deflection, but exhibits stresses higher than the material yield stress in a small area. After slight modifications to the bar attachment structure in a future design iteration, the tillage tool design will be ready to test in the field. by Elizabeth Porter. Thesis: S.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PROJECT CONTEXT ESCO Incorporated {{manufactures}} {{a variety}} of steel parts using a sand mold casting process. In this process a clamping device is used to prevent the sand mold from leaking during the pouring process. The current clamp design has several deficiencies including an uneven distribution of the clamping force, mold damage caused by the engagement of the clamping device, and the manual disengagement of the clamp. These factors result in defective parts and time delays in part manufacturing. The MIME capstone design team 46. 1 was tasked with creating an improved clamping device that would eliminate these issues and increase profits for ESCO. DESIGN PROCESS The team began the design process by analyzing the customer needs and developing corresponding engineering requirements. The second {{step in the process}} consisted of researching {{a variety of}} clamping designs and design components used both within and outside of the casting industry and evaluating them according to how well they satisfied the required functions. Based on this information the team created four different clamp designs. The four designs were then evaluated against the engineering requirements and ranked in a decision matrix. The concept with the highest ranking was selected as the final design. SELECTED DESIGN The clamp design selected for implementation, shown in Figure 1, is based on two main components: a <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>jack</b> and an adjustable steel footprint. The <b>rack</b> and pinion <b>jack</b> reduces set-up time by combining the clamp height adjustment and clamping force application with handle rotation. The force is applied smoothly, thus avoiding damage to the mold. The adjustable footprint uses steel angle irons that can withstand the high temperatures of the casting process and a slotted connection to accommodate a variety of mold layouts. It also distributes the required clamping force evenly. Finally, the design utilizes two pinned connections that allow the clamping device to disengage automatically from the sand mold. IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING The team purchased the <b>Rack</b> and Pinion <b>jack</b> from a company in Germany and purchased the remaining parts from local hardware stores. Next, the team performed all of the welding and fabrication for each of the components of the clamp at Oregon State University. The clamp was then assembled and tested on a simulated sand mold. Load cells were used to demonstrate the ability of the clamp to provide the necessary clamping force as well as the force distribution. Additional tests on the clamp were performed including: durability, setup time, maintenance, sand mold clearance, and the ability of the clamp to auto disengage. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The clamp design passed all of the tests. Based on the implementation and testing, modifications were made to improve the functionality of the clamp. First, the team replaced the plastic handle on the jack with an aluminum handle for increased durability. Second, the team added a sheet metal guard around the bottom portion of the rack to prevent damage due to liquid metal splashing onto the rack. In the future, the team recommends replacing the manually operated handle with an attachment that allows for a pneumatic drill to reduce setup time. Additionally, the team recommends adding a torque wrench attachment to the handle to provide a more consistent clamping force each time the clamp is engaged...|$|R
