5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>having</b> the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E

5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{are currently}} rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in shape. The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m. Modern lead blast furnaces {{are constructed using}} water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, and have no refractory linings in the side walls. The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory).

5|$|Crucible {{steel is}} steel {{that has been}} melted in a {{crucible}} <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>having</b> been forged, {{with the result that}} it is more homogeneous. Most previous furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the steel. The early modern crucible steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s.

At funerals, it encouraged mourners {{to leave the}} graveside, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>having</b> them wait until the coffin was lowered and cover it with earth themselves (as was the traditional practice). By this time, few members had bar mitzvah ceremonies for their 13-year-old boys; instead, boys and girls participated in the Reform Confirmation ceremony (though the synagogue still allowed those who wanted bar mitzvah ceremonies to have them). In 1916, the congregation eliminated the observance of the eighth days of Passover and Sukkot, required all worshipers to stand when mourners stood to recite the kaddish, and restored the Orthodox practice of blessing and naming babies in the synagogue {{as part of the}} services.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode of}} Quatermass II was telerecorded onto 35mm film during its live transmission, for a {{scheduled}} repeat the following Monday night at 10:15p.m. All six episodes survive intact in the BBC's archives, although the telerecording copies {{in some cases}} suffer from poor quality sound and vision. Owing to either technical or artistic problems, Cartier had some scenes re-performed by the cast immediately following the live performance on the Saturday evening, and these were telerecorded and used to replace the live versions in the Monday night repeats.

5|$|In 2016 it was {{proposed}} that large theropods like Tyrannosaurus had teeth covered in lips like modern day lizards, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>having</b> bare teeth like crocodiles. This {{was based on}} the presence of enamel, which according to this theory, may have to remain hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic species like crocodilians or toothless species like birds, which have lipless mouths and toothless beaks. Based on comparisons of bone texture of Daspletosaurus with crocodilians, a 2017 theory suggests that Tyrannosaurus and other tyrannosaurids may not have had lips at all and instead had large, flat scales that left no room for lips. The skull of Daspletosaurus also suggests that tyrannosaurids including Tyrannosaurus had integumentary sensory organs similar to crocodilians likely used in touch, temperature readings, prey detection and precise control of jaw movements.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, the ESRB {{introduced}} a streamlined, automated process for assigning ratings for console downloadable {{games as a}} way to address the rapidly growing volume of digitally-delivered games. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>having</b> raters review each product, publishers of these games complete a series of multiple-choice questions that address content across relevant categories, including violence, sexual content, language, etc. The responses automatically determine the game's rating category and content descriptors. Games rated via this process may be tested post-release to ensure that content was properly disclosed. The survey-based method is also used in the ESRB/CTIA and IARC rating programs for mobile apps.|$|E

5|$|Lead's lighter carbon group {{congeners}} form stable or metastable allotropes {{with the}} tetrahedrally coordinated and covalently bonded diamond cubic structure. The energy levels of their outer s- and p-orbitals are {{close enough to}} allow mixing into four hybrid sp3 orbitals. In lead, the inert pair effect increases the separation between its s- and p-orbitals, and the gap cannot be overcome by the energy that would be released by extra bonds following hybridization. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>having</b> a diamond cubic structure, lead forms metallic bonds in which only the p-electrons are delocalized and shared between the Pb2+ ions. Lead consequently has a face-centered cubic structure like the similarly sized divalent metals calcium and strontium.|$|E

It was believed that Nri's influence and bountiful amount of food was a reward for the ruler's blessings. Above all, Nri was a holy land for those Igbo who followed its edicts. It served as a place where sins and taboos could be absolved just by entering it. Even Igbo living far from the center of power would send abnormal children to Nri for ritual cleansing <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>having</b> them killed, as was sometimes the case for dwarfs or children who cut their top teeth before their lower teeth.|$|E

The operation was undertaken by the Royal Navy and British Commandos {{under the auspices of}} Combined Operations Headquarters on 28 March 1942. St Nazaire was targeted because the loss of its dry dock would force any large German warship in need of repairs, such as the 's sister ship , to return to home waters via either the English Channel or the GIUK gap, both of which were heavily defended by British units including the Royal Navy's Home Fleet, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>having</b> a haven available on the Atlantic coast in Nazi-occupied France.|$|E
