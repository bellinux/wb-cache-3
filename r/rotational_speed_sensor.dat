50|$|Different {{designs of}} {{governors}} {{have been used}} since the mid-19th century to control the speeds of the water turbines. A variety of flyball systems, or first-generation governors, were used during the first 100 years of water turbine speed controls. In early flyball systems, the flyball component countered by a spring acted directly to the valve of the turbine or the wicket gate to control {{the amount of water}} that enters the turbines. Newer systems with mechanical governors started around 1880. An early mechanical governors is a servomechanism that comprises a series of gears that use the turbine's speed to drive the flyball and turbine's power to drive the control mechanism. The mechanical governors were continued to be enhanced in power amplification through the use of gears and the dynamic behavior. By 1930, the mechanical governors had many parameters that could be set on the feedback system for precise controls. In the later part of the twentieth century, electronic governors and digital systems started to replace the mechanical governors. In the electronic governors, also known as second-generation governors, the flyball was replaced by <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> but the controls were still done through analog systems. In the modern systems, also known as third-generation governors, the controls are performed digitally by algorithms that are programmed to the computer of the governor.|$|E

Tools are developed to allow accurate real time monitoring of the individual cattle behaviour in a quest to improve the management of pastures. Studies have shown the relevancy of accelerometers in the analysis of behaviour using dedicated devices. Accelerometers are located either close to the mouth or jaw of the animal or on its forehead or neck. Records are usually performed at low frequency (< 1 Hz) and most studies classify behaviours using neuronal networks or multivariate statistical approaches, with little consideration to the animals’ actual movements. Inertial measurement units (IMU) in consumer mobile devices are specifically developed to record accurately user movements. Besides 3 D-accelerometer, they can include 3 -D <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensors,</b> 3 -D magnetometers and GPS. Optimised power consumption offers significant autonomy.

For many embedded control systems, {{the accuracy of the}} computed speed needs to be high, and this puts special demands on the pre-processing of the sensor signal. In a wired centralized solution, the computational unit can get access to the raw square wave signal from the sensor. Without a dedicated wire, the sensor must include a timer, and the cog times tk can be communicated to the processor. These cog times are the input to the algorithms described here, whose purpose is to calibrate manufacturing errors in the cog wheel and to interpolate the speed signal to the (usually time) domain of the application. A further purpose was to derive rules of thumb for how the sampling and quantization processes influence the bias and variance of the computed speed signal.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the application}} of two fault tolerant control schemes to a hydroelectric model developed in the Matlab and Simulink environments. The proposed fault tolerant controllers are exploited for regulating {{the speed of the}} Francis turbine included in the hydraulic system. The nonlinear behaviour of the hydraulic turbine and the inelastic water hammer effects are taken into account in order to develop a high-fidelity simulator of this dynamic plant. The first fault tolerant control solution relies on an adaptive control design, which exploits the recursive identification of a linear parametric time-varying model of the monitored system. The second scheme proposed uses the identification of a fuzzy model that is exploited for the reconstruction of the fault affecting the system under diagnosis. In this way, the fault estimation and its accommodation is possible. Note that these strategies, which are both based on identification approaches, are suggested for enhancing {{the application of}} the suggested fault tolerant control methodologies. These characteristics of the study represent key issues when on-line implementations are considered for a viable application of the proposed fault tolerant control schemes. The faults considered in this paper affect the electric servomotor used as a governor, the hydraulic turbine speed sensor, and the hydraulic turbine system, and are imposed both separately and simultaneously. Moreover, the complete drop of the <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> is also analysed. Monte-Carlo simulations are also used for analysing the most important issues of the proposed schemes in the presence of parameter variations. Moreover, the performances achieved by means of the proposed solutions are compared to those of a standard PID controller already developed for the considered model. Finally, these strategies serve to highlight the potential application of the proposed control strategies to real hydraulic systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{real-time}} {{systems are}} recently {{getting more and}} more attention, mostly {{due to the fact that}} small, embedded devices used for control purposes are becoming more and more powerful. It allows performing more and more complex tasks. This results in increasing complexity and cost of development of such systems. The ability to check early if the system designed can meet the quality expectations is of great importance. There are already existing methods for predicting the quality of the final system. They usually require very precise model of the system. The purpose of this report is to present how well UML fits the needs of real-time designers. In the report we characterise briefly real-time systems. Later we describe how the specific real-time concepts can be modelled using UML. Finally we present a specialized real-time UML profile. 1. Real-time systems The complexity of real-time systems development is predominately connected with their major characteristic – timeliness. The correctness of a system is judged not only by the functional requirements, describing what the system does, but mostly by non-functional requirements, which refer to quality aspects of the service delivery. The “late answer is wrong answer ” rule clearly indicates which quality aspects are considered the most important. The late answer can sometimes be even worse than no answer at all. As an example, the typical real-time control systems like ABS, ESP or ASR can be presented. These are the systems that control traction of the car – they operate mostly by appropriately using the car brakes. They are constantly fed (Fig. 1) with data from number of sensors (e. g. <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor,</b> sensor for lateral acceleration, sensor for rate of rotation, sensor for brake pressure, sensor for steering angle).

For event-based state reconstruction of linear time-invariant continuous system, it is first shown that the traditional passive-type state reconstruction that does not require input design will fail in general, even if the system has a full-rank observability matrix. It is proved that under controllability conditions and bounded uncertainty on the initial state, it is always possible to construct a causal input that will cause the output to cross the sensor threshold in a designated time interval and the input design is explored. Then after introducing the main theoretical foundation of this thesis on the number of zeros of a special class of functions in a designated time interval and by using some recent mathematics results on zeros of harmonic functions, it is proved that if the system is observable, such a reconstruction is always possible if the eigenvalues of the system are all real valued and if the eigenvalues of the system contain only purely imaginary and non-repeating values, it is sufficient that threshold crossing occurs within a relatively small time interval. At present, general conclusions for the numbers of zeros of functions that are sums of weighted exponential and sinusoidal functions remain unavailable, but in general without constraints on system eigenvalues, an input can always be randomized to ensure that the state can be reconstructed with probability one. Constructive algorithms are developed for initial state reconstruction under these conditions. Illustrative examples with only one binary sensor are provided and applications of a simplified DC electric machine with the known load or the unknown load and with multiple binary sensors are proved. After a general event-based control strategy is proposed, a hybrid two-stage finite-time controller consisted of two open loop procedures performed sequentially is explained as: 1) Finite-time initial state estimation based on enough recorded pairs of system output values and time instant values generated by the events. Once the state is reconstructed, 2) Finite-time control to drive the system from the current state to the desired state based on the optimal control is calculated and applied. The proposed method is illustrated by the example of a position control of an AGV in the seaport container terminal environment...|$|R

It was found that tensile strength at maximum fiber loading content at screw <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> of 172 rpm and 258 rpm are lower than the calculated strength values around 28. 9 % and 31. 8 %, respectively. The effect of cylinder temperature was also elucidated...|$|R
