500|$|The first {{screenplay}} Griffith wrote was Cardula, a Dracula-themed story {{involving a}} vampire music critic. After Corman rejected the idea, Griffith says {{he wrote a}} screenplay titled Gluttony, in which the protagonist was [...] "a salad chef in a restaurant who would wind up cooking customers and stuff like that, you know? We couldn’t do that though because of the code at the time. So I said, “How about a man-eating plant?”, and <b>Roger</b> <b>said,</b> “Okay.” By that time, we were both drunk." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I Want to Be Your Man" [...] {{was added}} to US urban {{contemporary}} radio playlists in September 1987; a commercial single was released the following month. Initially, the song received heavy airplay on radio stations in California, particularly Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area, and in Southern states. It climbed to {{number one on the}} Billboard Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart for the week ending December 19, 1987. [...] "I Want to Be Your Man" [...] crossed over to pop radio and peaked at number three on the Hot 100 singles chart issue dated February 13, 1988.

2500|$|On August 10 Hilton {{released}} her 10th fragrance, Tease, which {{was inspired by}} Marilyn Monroe. On August 19 she launched a footwear line in Las Vegas, saying about the collection (priced from $60 to $160) {{in an interview that}} she [...] "chose the styling, design, materials and colours for the line and also wanted {{to make sure it was}} super comfortable". That month Hilton was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession in Las Vegas and her boyfriend, Cy Waits, was charged with driving under the influence. Hilton's defense initially claimed that the handbag (containing 0.8g of cocaine) was not hers: [...] "This purse in question was a high street brand– and by no means up to her high fashion standards." [...] She later claimed personal items (including cash and credit cards) from the bag, acknowledging that it was hers. To avoid a felony conviction, Hilton pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors on September 17, 2010. Under the terms of the plea bargain she was sentenced to one year of probation, 200 hours of community service, a $2,000 fine and the completion of a drug-abuse treatment program. Clark County District Attorney David <b>Roger</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "If she was arrested for anything besides a minor traffic violation she will spend a year in jail. There will be no discussion. The court will have no discretion." [...] On September 21, 2010, on their way to a Tokyo press conference to promote fashion and fragrance lines, Hilton and her sister Nicky were stopped by immigration officers at Narita Airport because of Hilton's drug-possession conviction the previous day. Under Japan's strict drug laws, travelers convicted of a drug crime are usually denied entry into the country. Airport officials questioned Hilton [...] "for hours", and she and Nicky were detained overnight at the airport hotel. On September 22 Japanese authorities denied Hilton entry, and she was put on a plane back to the United States. Other stops on their Asian promotional tour were canceled due to Indonesia and Malaysia's anti-drug laws. The critically acclaimed documentary Teenage Paparazzo, in which Hilton appeared, aired on HBO on September 27.|$|E
