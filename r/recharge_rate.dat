The most important groundwater reserves in Paraguay in terms of capacity are the Guaraní and the Raigon Aquifer.

25|$|Although {{groundwater}} {{sources are}} quite prevalent, one major {{area of concern}} is the renewal rate or <b>recharge</b> <b>rate</b> of some groundwater sources. Abstracting from groundwater sources that are non-renewable could lead to exhaustion if not properly monitored and managed. Another concern of increased groundwater usage is the diminished water quality of the source over time. Reduction of natural outflows, decreasing stored volumes, declining water levels and water degradation are commonly observed in groundwater systems. Groundwater depletion may result in many negative effects such as increased cost of groundwater pumping, induced salinity and other water quality changes, land subsidence, degraded springs and reduced baseflows. Human pollution is also harmful to this important resource.|$|E

Unsaturated-zone Cl tracer data {{and nutrient}} (NO 3 and PO 4) concentrations {{were used to}} quantify <b>recharge</b> <b>rates</b> using the Cl mass balance approach and nutrient availability in the Thar Desert, Rajasthan, India. Soil cores were collected in dune/interdune settings in the arid Thar Desert (near Jaisalmer) and in rain-fed (nonirrigated) and irrigated cropland in the semiarid desert margin (near Jaipur). <b>Recharge</b> <b>rates</b> were also simulated using unsaturated zone modeling. <b>Recharge</b> <b>rates</b> in sparsely vegetated dune/interdune settings in the Jaisalmer study area are 2. 7 – 5. 6 mm/year (2 – 3 % of precipitation, 165 mm/year).

40|$|Documenting the {{location}} and magnitude of groundwater recharge is critical for understanding groundwater flow systems. Radioactive tracers, notably 14 C, 3 H, 36 Cl, and the noble gases, together with other tracers whose concentrations vary over time, such as the chlorofluorocarbons or sulfur hexafluoride, are commonly used to estimate <b>recharge</b> <b>rates.</b> This review discusses some of the advantages and problems of using these tracers to estimate <b>recharge</b> <b>rates.</b> The suite of tracers allows recharge to be estimated over timescales ranging from {{a few years to}} several hundred thousand years, which allows both the long-term and modern behaviour of groundwater systems to be documented. All tracers record mean residence times and mean <b>recharge</b> <b>rates</b> rather than a specific age and date of recharge. The timescale over which <b>recharge</b> <b>rates</b> are averaged increases with the mean residence time. This is an advantage in providing representative <b>recharge</b> <b>rates</b> but presents a problem in comparing <b>recharge</b> <b>rates</b> derived from these tracers with those from other techniques, such as water table fluctuations or lysimeters. In addition to issues relating to the sampling and interpretation of specific tracers, macroscopic dispersion and mixing in groundwater flow systems limit how precisely groundwater residence times and <b>recharge</b> <b>rates</b> may be estimated. Additionally, many recharge studies have utilised existing infrastructure that may not be ideal for this purpose (e. g., wells with long screens that sample groundwater several kilometres from the recharge area).

25|$|Geysers: Geysers such as Old Faithful are {{a type of}} {{geothermal}} {{feature that}} periodically erupt scalding hot water. Increased pressure exerted by the enormous weight of the overlying rock and water prevents deeper water from boiling. As the hot water rises it is under less pressure and steam bubbles form. They, in turn, expand on their ascent until the bubbles are too big and numerous to pass freely through constrictions. At a critical point the confined bubbles actually lift the water above, causing the geyser to splash or overflow. This decreases {{the pressure of the}} system and violent boiling results. Large quantities of water flash into tremendous amounts of steam that force a jet of water out of the vent: an eruption begins. Water (and heat) is expelled faster than the geyser’s <b>recharge</b> <b>rate,</b> gradually decreasing the system’s pressure and eventually ending the eruption.|$|E
25|$|The Ogallala aquifer, or the High Plains aquifer, is an {{integral}} fresh water source for {{the entirety of the}} Great Plains region, providing drinking water to 80% of the population and irrigating 13 million acres of land. Precipitation, seasonal lakes, and prehistoric water reserves serve as sources of water for the aquifer, which lies beneath 174,000 square miles of the Central and Southern regions, contains 3.25 billion acre-feet of water, and which is used by around 200,000 irrigation wells. Around 95% of the water pumped out of the aquifer is used for irrigation for the extensive areas of farmland in the Great Plains. The playa lakes, or seasonal lakes, are the primary sources of recharge for the aquifer, with an average of 0.5 inches per year as the <b>recharge</b> <b>rate</b> for the entire High Plains region.

25|$|Human {{pressures}} on global freshwater systems are having dramatic effects. The freshwater cycle is another boundary significantly affected by climate change. Freshwater resources, such as lakes and aquifers, are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge (the term fossil water is sometimes {{used to describe}} aquifers which don't recharge). Overexploitation occurs if a water resource is mined or extracted {{at a rate that}} exceeds the <b>recharge</b> <b>rate.</b> Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. Forests enhance the recharge of aquifers in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer depletion. Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as nitrates, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean. This turns much of the world's underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil. Though Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources, their overexploitation can result in a Hubbert-like peak. A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.|$|E
40|$|Sand Hollow Reservoir {{in southwestern}} Utah, USA, is {{operated}} for both surface-water storage and artificial recharge {{to the underlying}} Navajo Sandstone. The total volume of estimated artificial recharge between 2002 and 2007 is 85 million cubic meters (69, 000 acre-feet). Since 2002, artificial <b>recharge</b> <b>rates</b> have generally been declining and are inversely correlated with the increasing surface area of the reservoir. Permeability testing of core samples retrieved from beneath the reservoir indicates that this decline may not be due to silt accu-mulation. Artificial <b>recharge</b> <b>rates</b> also show much seasonal variability. Calculations of apparent intrinsic permeability show that these variations can only partly be explained by variation in water viscosity associated with seasonal changes in water temperature. Sporadic seasonal trends in <b>recharge</b> <b>rates</b> and intrinsic permeability during 2002 - 2004 could {{be associated with the}} large fluctuations in reservoir elevation and wetted area.

Of the total gross irrigated area, 16–17% is irrigated by government-owned canals and 83–84% by privately owned tube wells and other wells extracting groundwater, which is the predominant source of irrigation and water supply to the agricultural areas. As a result, Gujarat has faced problems with groundwater depletion, especially after demand for water went up in the 1960s. As access to electricity in rural areas increased, subermersible electric pumps became more popular in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Gujarat Electricity Board switched to flat tariff rates linked to the horsepower of pumps, which increased tubewell irrigation again and decreased the use of electric pumps.
