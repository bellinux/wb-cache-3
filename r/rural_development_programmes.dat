5|$|Following {{his move}} to Pakistan, Khan {{was asked to}} {{implement}} the Comilla Model in rural settlements of North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Punjab, and Sindh. He declined the offer {{on the grounds that}} the proposals were predominantly motivated by political interests rather than the common well-being. However, he continued to advise the authorities on various aspects of rural development, such as participatory irrigation management. He worked as a research fellow at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad from 1971 to 1972, and as Director of Rural Economics Research Project at Karachi University from 1972 to 1973. Khan went to Michigan State University as a visiting professor in 1973 and remained there until 1979. During this time, he carried on advising the Rural Development Academy at Bogra in northern Bangladesh, and the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development, Peshawar, on the Daudzai Integrated Rural Development Programme. He also traveled extensively during this period in the capacities of speaker, advisor, or consultant on <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> across the world. In 1974, he was appointed as a World Bank consultant to survey rural development situations in Java, Indonesia. He also briefly worked as a visiting professor at Lund University, Harvard University, and Oxford University.|$|E
500|$|Kanshi Ram {{founded the}} BSP in 1984. Influenced by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, the chief {{architect}} of the Constitution of India, the party's primary focus {{is to improve the}} situation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other disadvantaged groups through police reform, affirmative action on hiring of members of scheduled castes for government posts, and providing <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>programmes.</b> Reservation in India is a system whereby a percentage of government positions and seats at universities are reserved for persons of backward classes and scheduled castes and tribes. Throughout her political career, Mayawati supported reservation in both government and private sectors for backward classes, with an increase in quotas and inclusion of more communities such as religious minorities and economically weak upper castes. In August 2012 a bill was cleared that starts the process of amending the constitution so that the reservation system can be expanded to promotions in state jobs. Mayawati's career has been called a [...] "miracle of democracy" [...] by former Prime Minister of India P. V. Narasimha Rao. Millions of Dalit supporters view her as an icon and refer to her as [...] "Behen-ji" [...] (sister). Her public meetings have been attended by large audiences, who use slogans such as [...] "Kanshi Ram ka mission Adhoora; karegi Behen Mayawati poora" [...] (Kanshi Ram's unfulfilled mission will be completed by Mayawati) and [...] "Behenji tum sangharsh karo; hum tumhare saath hain" [...] (Sister, go ahead with your struggle; we are with you).|$|E
2500|$|In 1916, K. T. Paul {{became the}} first Indian {{national}} general secretary of India. Paul had started <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> for self-reliance of marginal farmers, through co-operatives and credit societies. These programmes became very popular. He also coined the term [...] "rural reconstruction," [...] {{and many of the}} principles he developed were later incorporated into the government's nationwide community development programmes. In 1923, Y.C. James Yen, of the YMCA of China, devised the [...] "thousand character system," [...] based on pilot projects in education. The method also became very popular, and in 1923, it led to the founding of the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement. In 1878, the YMCA was organized inside the Jaffa Gate of the Old City of Jerusalem and the current landmark building was dedicated by General Lord Allenby in 1933 during the British Mandate of Palestine. [...] During World War II the YMCA was involved in war work with displaced persons and refugees. They set up War Prisoners Aid to support prisoners of war by providing sports equipment, musical instruments, art materials, radios, gramophones, eating utensils, and other items.|$|E
