50|$|External {{parabolic}} collectors require proper heat insulation, {{double-glazed windows}} over the zenithal opening and <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> to reduce excessive lighting, glare and heat on sunny days. Integrated anidolic systems reduce external protrusion {{and attempt to}} visually blend into traditional facades, however, like all anidolic systems, they are susceptible to glare and offer no protection from overheating on sunny days.|$|E
50|$|At {{the height}} of the Cold War in the mid 1960s, the agency was merged into the BND, the {{successor}} of the Gehlen Org. It was located in Karlsruhe and the Zimmerle & Co. which served as the front, ostensibly specializing in <b>roller</b> <b>blinds.</b> Aside from Soviet counter-intelligence activities, the agency also began monitoring domestic leftists and pacifists.|$|E

40|$|A testhouse {{was set up}} on the Institute's {{test area}} to {{investigate}} the behaviour of passive solar components designed for application within the residential hous project of Kaiser Bautechnik in Düsseldorf/Hellerhof, FRG. Results are presented from measurements between January and April 1989 for - a double glazing with integrated <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> and low emissivity coated inner glass pane - a transparent wall insulation system with integrated <b>roller</b> <b>blind.</b> Results are given in combination with the measured climate conditions. The U-value of the glazing was found to be 1. 1 W/qmK with the blind closed and 1. 8 W/qmK with opened blind. The effective monthly U-values of the transparently insulated wall vary between - 0. 9 and - 2. 9 W/qmK. Thereby the wall's heat losses were decreased about 80 % in comparison to an opaque insulated wall having a similar U-value. Heat gains to the room of 65 kWh/qm were achieved. The system's design was found to fulfill the required properties. A few improvements wer e suggested...|$|R
50|$|The term window blinds {{can also}} be used to {{describe}} window coverings generically—in this context window blinds include almost every type of window covering, i.e. shutters, <b>roller</b> <b>blinds,</b> cellular shades (also called honeycomb shades), wood blinds, roman blinds and of course, standard vertical and horizontal blinds. In the United Kingdom, awnings are sometimes called blinds or shades.|$|E
50|$|The term window blinds is also {{sometimes}} used, somewhat inaccurately, to describe window coverings generically—in this context window blinds include almost {{every type of}} window covering, including both curtains and blinds for homes and commercial premises, such as bars/pubs, offices, and shops, e.g., Plantation Shutters/Jigsaw Shutters, Roman blinds, <b>roller</b> <b>blinds,</b> and of course, vertical and horizontal blinds.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} in 1971 by Tony Hillary. He originally made blinds in a converted garage {{at his home in}} Nottingham.

In 1974, <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> were introduced to the range.|$|E
50|$|The 4EPB units (4-car Electro-Pneumatic Brake) were a {{development}} of the Southern Railway (SR) 4Sub design, but incorporating electro-pneumatic brakes, unit-to-unit buckeye couplings, <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> headcode displays {{in place of the}} stencil holders used previously, and without external doors to the driver's cab. There were motor-generators for the lighting and current control whereas previous practice had been to use series lighting and a voltage divider for the control circuits.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea for}} a furling jib is usually {{attributed}} to Major E du Boulay in England who invented a device similar to a <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> for reefing a jib. Major Wykeham-Martin used one of Boulay's rollers and improved the system by incorporating roller bearings in 1907 when the system was patented. The original castings were made by London-based toilet makers Bouldings. By the 1940s nearly every British cruising yacht was fitted with this furling system.|$|R
50|$|Centrally located {{immediately}} {{below the}} front half gable {{is a large}} rectangular inclined skylight supported by timber mullions, the bottom of which meets {{the top of a}} projecting bay window. This tripartite window consists of a central sash window with casements on either side. The upper portion of all 3 windows is multi-paned, while the lower portions have a single pane. Both the skylight and the bay window have modern <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> systems attached to the outside.|$|R
50|$|Early {{industry}} in Falköping was the Victoria Brewery (sv. Victoriabryggeriet) (1856-1953), Haglunds <b>Roller</b> <b>blinds</b> factory (sv. Haglunds rullgardinsfabrik) (1885-) and Forss hat factory (sv. Forss hattfabrik) (1880-). In the early 20th-century (1900-) several companies were established, such as: Alton gold forgery (1928), Falköping dairy factory (sv. Falköpings Mejeri) (1930-), workshop industry Arkivator (sv. verkstadsindustrin Arkivator) (1940-) and the sewing factories Svaréns and Ottossons.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} Contax (Germany) 35 mm RF camera of 1932 had a {{vertical}} travel FP shutter with dual brass-slatted <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> with adjustable spring tension and slit width, {{and a top}} speed of 1/1000 s (the Contax II of 1936 had a claimed 1/1250 s top speed), but it was woefully unreliable and not an antecedent of the modern Square shutter.|$|E
50|$|About halfway {{along the}} strand is the Sandymount Martello tower, {{part of a}} system of defences built to warn of an {{invasion}} by Napoleon. The Tower was a popular cafe back in the 1960s. An attempt to turn the tower into a restaurant led to the installation of a large window with <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> on the seaward side of the tower. The restaurant never opened, leaving the tower with the modified window, and landscaped exterior abandoned on the strand.|$|E
25|$|The second batch, {{numbered}} 146 to 155, {{had similar}} bodies {{built by the}} Brush Electrical Engineering Company Limited of Loughborough, mounted on Brush-built P.22 trucks and with identical equipment to the U.E.C. cars, except for 146, which had a B.T.H electromagnetic brake instead of the air slipper type. All these cars were delivered with <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> indicators, and gradually, but with no small objection from the travelling public, this type of indicator was fitted to practically all the remaining cars.|$|R
5000|$|The MG [...] "Y" [...] Type had an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} interior furnishing and finish, {{in accordance with the}} best British traditions. The facing surfaces of all seats were leather, as were the door pockets. The rear of the front seats were made from Rexine, a form of leathercloth, which matched the leather fronts, as were the door panels themselves. A <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> was fitted to the rear window as an anti-glare mechanism (not a privacy screen as many think).|$|R
25|$|The {{first car}} to be {{fitted with a}} new U.E.C. lower saloon was no. 16 and this {{appeared}} in service during the summer, the remaining rebuilt cars appearing shortly afterward. The fitting of top covers to these earlier cars had caused the original lower saloon frames to bow owing to the extra weight. These new saloons had normal staircases, while the existing equipment {{was replaced by the}} new Dick, Kerr 40 h.p. motors and D.B.I. controllers. The position of the track wheel was altered, and <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> indicators were fitted.|$|R
