50|$|Strike-slip {{tectonics}} {{is associated}} with the <b>relative</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> of parts of the crust or the lithosphere. This type of tectonics is found along oceanic and continental transform faults which connect offset segments of mid-ocean ridges. Strike-slip tectonics also occurs at lateral offsets in extensional and thrust fault systems. In areas involved with plate collisions strike-slip deformation occurs in the over-riding plate in zones of oblique collision and accommodates deformation in the foreland to a collisional belt.|$|E

Computer models and in vivo measurements suggest that single FtsZ filaments cannot sustain a length more than 30 subunits long. In this model, FtsZ scission force {{comes from the}} <b>relative</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> of subunits.

40|$|An {{electrical}} conductor and antenna are positioned in a fixed relationship to one another. <b>Relative</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> is generated between the {{electrical conductor}} and a homogenous material {{while maintaining the}} electrical conductor at a fixed distance from the homogenous material. The antenna supplies a time-varying magnetic field that causes the electrical conductor to resonate and generate harmonic electric and magnetic field responses. Disruptions {{in at least one}} of the electric and magnetic field responses during this lateral movement are indicative of a lateral location of a subsurface anomaly. Next, relative out-of-plane movement is generated between the electrical conductor and the homogenous material in the vicinity of the anomaly's lateral location. Disruptions in {{at least one of the}} electric and magnetic field responses during this out-of-plane movement are indicative of a depth location of the subsurface anomaly. A recording of the disruptions provides a mapping of the anomaly...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{relative}} structural timing and isotope geochronology as means of correlating Precambrian orogenic belts and testing {{the role of}} continental drift in crustal assembly was first proposed by Holmes (1951), using the network of Proterozoic orogenic belts and Archaean cratons of south-central Africa as an example. Subsequent work in the region emphasized a limited role for <b>relative</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>movements,</b> based principally on a distinctive outcrop pattern in which older belts occur {{on both sides of}} younger cross-cutting belts with no apparent offset. This spatial relationship is more consistent with ensialic rejuvenation than with continental collision (Kröner 1977), and perhaps the best known of these cross-cutting relationships is that between the Irumide and Zambezi belts. The Zambezi Belt is part of an east-west trending zone of Neoproterozoic tectonism that passes westwards into the Damara Orogen. It is associated with eclogite relics and reworking of older basement blocks including possible island arc and ophiolite terranes, and Coward & Daly (1984) noted that high-strain structures within the belt are consistent with significant sinistral transcurrent movement and oblique collision along a probable plate margin. This evidence for continental assembly of previously disparate blocks has long been countered b...|$|R
5000|$|The major {{finding of}} this study is that the human {{cognition}} contains three components, or three broad types of [...] "cultural rules of behavior", namely, Values, Expectations, and Ad Hoc Rules, each of which has a mutually conditioning relationship with behavior. The three cognitive components are different in terms of the scope and duration of their mutual shaping of behavior. Values are universal and enduring rules of behavior; Expectations, on the other hand, are context-specific behavioral rules; while Ad Hoc Rules are improvised rules of behavior that the human mind devises contingent upon a particular occasion. Furthermore, they need not be consistent, and frequently are not, among themselves. Metaphorically, they can be compared to a multi-carriage train, which allows for the <b>relative</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>movements</b> by individual carriages so as to accommodate bumps and turns in the tracks. In fact, they provide a [...] "shock-absorber mechanism", so to speak, which enables individuals in SW-ICCM contexts to cope with conflicts in cultural practices and values, and to accommodate and adapt themselves to cultural contexts where people from different national cultural backgrounds work together over extended time. It also provides a powerful framework which explains how interactions by individuals in SW-ICCM contexts give rise to emerging hybrid cultural practices characterized by both stability and change.|$|R
40|$|Although {{it is well}} {{established}} that action contexts can expand the perceived durations of action-related events, whether action contexts also impact the subjective duration of events unrelated to the action remains an open issue. Here we examined how the automatic implicit reactions induced by viewing task-irrelevant, real moving objects influence tactile duration judgments. Participants were asked to make temporal bisection judgments of a tactile event while seeing a potentially catchable swinging ball. Approaching movement induced a tactile-duration overestimation <b>relative</b> to <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> and to a static baseline, and receding movement produced an expansion similar in duration to that from approaching movement. Interestingly, the effect of approaching movement on the subjective tactile duration was greatly reduced when participants held lightweight objects in their hands, relative to a hands-free condition, whereas no difference was obtained in the tactile-duration estimates between static hands-free and static hands-occupied conditions. The results indicate that duration perception is determined by internal bodily {{states as well as}} by sensory evidence...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study is}} {{conducted for the}} lateral torsional buckling of wooden beam-deck assemblies consisting of twin beams braced by tongue-and-groove decking at the top. Two models are developed, each {{with a series of}} analytical and numerical solutions formulated. The first model targets twin-beam-deck assemblies where deck boards and other components are detailed to provide full continuous lateral restraint while the second model is built for situations where the beams are allowed to sway laterally and the <b>relative</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> between the beams is partially restrained by the deck boards. In the first model, focus is on wind uplift while in the second model, both gravity and uplift loading scenarios are investigated. In the first model, an energy method is adopted and the principle of stationary potential energy is evoked to formulate closed-form solutions, energy-based solutions and a finite element solution. The validity of the present solutions is verified against a finite element based ABAQUS model. Similarly, a family of solutions is developed under the sway model and verified against the ABAQUS. Parametric studies are conducted for both models {{to examine the effects of}} various variables on the buckling capacity. A comparative investigation on the behavioral difference between the two models under ABAQUS is also presented. Overall, the restraining effects of deck boards bracing either on the beam compression or tension side is observed to have a significant influence on the lateral torsional buckling capacity of the twin-beam-deck assemblies...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{globalization}} and economic integration {{have resulted in}} culturally diverse and dynamic workplace realities. The dominant perspective on culture in international cross-cultural management (ICCM), however, still views culture as fixed and immutable. Other perspectives that regard culture as variable and emergent have emerged {{in recent years to}} better accommodate the new workplace realities. The emerging perspectives, however, seem to have gone to the other extreme, conceptualizing it as emergent and "in the making". The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a perspective on culture which would integrate the views of both opposing camps. Qualitative field data were collected by conducting semi-structured interviews of Chinese and Western expatriate informants working in Sino-Western ICCM (SW-ICCM) contexts in China, supplemented by non-participant observation and documentary data. Three cultural themes, pay confidentiality (PC), knowledge/information sharing (KIS), and status differentiation (SD), were developed for the semi-structured interview and non-participant observation. Next, the data were analyzed in grounded fashion to generate a substantive theory for each of the three theme areas. Finally, the theme-grounded substantive theories were compared and integrated to generate a formal theory that would apply to SW-ICCM contexts in general. Results show that the emerging culture in the SW-ICCM context takes on a hybrid form. Another major finding is the demarcation of Cognitive State into three interrelated variables, Values, Expectations, and Contingencies, each of which has a mutually conditioning relationship with behavior. As defined in this thesis, Values are concerned with fundamental rights-and-wrongs with regard to behavior, and are thus context-independent. Expectations refer to a set of cognitive rules regarding appropriate behavior that a person develops through interaction with other individuals in a particular context; as such they are context-dependent or context-specific. Contingencies refer to behavioral rules formulated ad hoc according to the behavior of the cultural other on a particular occasion. Therefore they are occasion-dependent or occasion-specific. The three cognitive variables need not be consistent among themselves. Metaphorically, they can be compared to a multi-carriage train, which allows for the <b>relative</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>movements</b> by individual carriages so as to cope with bumps and turns in the tracks. They enable individuals to cope with conflicts in cultural practices and values, and to accommodate and adapt themselves to SW-ICCM contexts. They explain how interactions by individuals give rise to emerging hybrid cultural practices characterized by both stability and change. One major theoretical contribution of this "multi-carriage train" perspective is its allowance for the existence of inconsistencies among the three cognitive variables. Furthermore, inconsistencies may even exist within each of them. This internal inconsistency view contradicts the traditional internal consistency assumption held by many culture scholars. The other major theoretical contribution is the view of culture as an over-arching entity comprising a multiplicity of Values, Expectations, and Contingencies. This notion of one (multiplicity) culture to an organization leads to the classification of culture along its path of emergence into nascent, adolescent, and mature types, each of which is distinct in terms of the pattern of the cognitive variables and behavior...|$|R

The IAA- 1 - 14 C was supplied asymmetrically to the apical end of the segment. The results were as follows: A) In air more 14 C {{was found in the}} lower half of horizontal segments supplied with an upper donor than in the half opposite the donor in vertical segments. The enhanced <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> of 14 C in geotropically stimulated segments of corn coleoptiles under aerobic conditions has thus been confirmed. B) This increased <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> of 14 C in geotropically stimulated segments is greatly reduced, but is not completely abolished, under anaerobic conditions. C) The <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> of 14 C in vertical segments is significantly less under anaerobic conditions than in air. D) Under anaerobic conditions, the <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> of 14 C in horizontal segments can be reduced to the level found in vertical segments by pre-soaking the tissue in a 1 mm solution of the metabolic inhibitor sodium fluoride for 2 hours.

The mechanics based and empirical methods of analysis include simplifications and assumptions. It is concluded that any assessment of <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> potential should include as many methods of analysis as practical and include sensitivity checks on the assumed parameters.

40|$|<b>Lateral</b> <b>movement</b> of {{sheet pile}} driven in soft soils {{has been a}} major problem in {{geotechnical}} engineering. It was reported that the conventional theories such as Rankine and Coulomb theory has overpredicted the <b>lateral</b> <b>movement,</b> hence causing inaccuracy. On top of that, the behavior of <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> on soft soil is not well understood since it is complicated and involved many parameters. So, the objectives of this study are to understand the behavior of soft soil in terms of <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> and to measure the amount of <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> on soft soil using physical laboratory model and Finite Element Method, which is PL AXIS. Excavation work has been conducted on the physical model {{and at the same time}} the available models in PLAXIS software such as MohrCoulomb (MC), Hardening-Soil (HS), Soft Soil (SS) and Soft Soil Creep (SSC) model were employed to predict the amount of movement during excavation. Based on the results, the amount of <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> is proportional to the depth of excavation. The <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> increases as the depth of excavation increases. Moreover, through physical modeling, it was found that the angle of wedge failure is the same as Rankine theory which is (45 °+ 0 / 2). Besides that, through Finite Element Method, it was observed that the Soft Soil Creep model gives more accurate results since this model is specially design for soft soil problems. As a recommendion, this study can be enhanced by using centrifuge model due to its ability to replicate the real soil unit weight, therefore producing more reliable results. In terms of Finite Element Method, 3 -D model should be engaged in order to obtain more accurate results...|$|R
