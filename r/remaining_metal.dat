The Illinois Historic Bridge Survey, which Lyndon Bridge was not a part of, identified 374 Illinois highway-related bridges that were eligible for listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Of those, only six were Parker through truss bridges from {{the period of the}} Lyndon Bridge's construction and early use, 1898-1917.

The Lyndon Bridge later had its National Register eligibility determined by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency despite being omitted from the 1994 survey.

This study integrated macroscopic and spectroscopic analyses {{to assess their}} influence on the distribution and chemical speciation of the <b>remaining</b> <b>metals</b> {{as well as their}} interaction with the soil surface after 48 -h washing of a field-contaminated soil. The results demonstrated that EDDS and GLDA were an appealing alternative to non-biodegradable ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid, but the three humic substances were less effective. As shown by sequential extractions, Cu was primarily extracted from the carbonate fraction while Cr and As extraction resulted from (co-) dissolution of the oxide fraction. As a result, the relative proportion of strongly bound organic matter and residual fractions increased by 7 - 16 %. However, it was noteworthy that the exchangeable fraction also increased by 5 - 11 %, signifying that a portion of the <b>remaining</b> <b>metals</b> was destabilized by {{chelating agents}} and transformed to be more labile in the treated soil. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra confirmed the substantial removal of readily accessible Cu from the soil surface, but Cr maintained its original chemical forms of trivalent chromium oxides and iron-chromium coprecipitates, whereas As remained as arsenic trioxide/pentoxide and copper arsenate precipitates. On the other hand, the absence of characteristic peaks of adsorbed carboxylate groups in the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra inferred that the extent of adsorption of chelating agents and humic substances on the bulk soil was insufficient to be characterized by FTIR analysis. These results suggested that attention should be paid to the exchangeable fraction of Cu and oxides/coprecipitates of As prior to possible on-site reuse of the treated soil.

40|$|Mobility and {{toxicity}} of heavy metals in river sediments seldom {{relate to their}} total concentrations, but {{to a greater extent}} depend on their distribution of speciation fractions. Ex situ washing of dredged sediment can effectively reduce the total metal contents, but it may transform metals into more mobile species. This study investigated the changes of the metal fraction distribution and the mobility risk of chemical washed river sediment. Batch chemical-enhanced washing experiments with different agents, including inorganic acids and salt solutions, chelating agents, and oxidizing agents, were conducted on the heavy metal-contaminated sediment collected from Shenzhen River in South China. The removal of Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn from the sediment was evaluated, and the corresponding changes of metal fraction distribution were examined by using a sequential extraction procedure. The mobility of the <b>remaining</b> <b>metals</b> in the washed sediment was assessed by leaching extractability and compared to those in the original sediment. The results showed that inorganic acid washing effectively removed the majority of heavy metals, but the transformation of Cr, Cu, and Pb from the reducible fraction to the acid-extractable fraction significantly enhanced the mobility of the <b>remaining</b> <b>metals</b> in the washed sediment. Chelating agents such as EDTA and EDDS could efficiently extract Pb and Zn from the sediment, but to a less extent with Cu and Cr. Chelating agents also reduced the relative portions of Cr, Cu, and Pb associated with reducible fraction. Cu and Cr extraction would require the use of oxidizing agents such as H 2 O 2 and Na 2 S 2 O 8 that reduced their relative portions associated with the oxidizable fraction. Citric acid was only effective for Cr removal through dissolution of Fe oxides/hydroxides into which Cr(III) incorporates. The feasibility of acid washing for sediment remediation should be reconsidered due to high mobility of residual metals, while H 2 O 2 could be a promising additive for sediment remediation. However, a balance should be established between removing labile metal species and minimizing metal transformation.
