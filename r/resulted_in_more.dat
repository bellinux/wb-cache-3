Early protests on campus led to firebombing and window-breaking, but Corbally's decision to cancel classes and allow the students to protest without police or administration interference arguably <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> moderate protests than at other colleges.|$|E

The alliance between Greater Poland and Pomerania was directed against Brandenburg and in 1274, <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> than one retaliatory expedition against Greater Poland; taken by surprise, the princes watched how without major obstacles the Brandenburg army came to Poznań, and burned the main fortress of the city. Only after this, the Greater Poland knighthood was hastily organized {{and was able to}} expel the invaders.|$|E

5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century, {{the need for}} Arabian blood to improve the {{breeding}} stock for light cavalry horses in Europe <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> excursions to the Middle East. Queen Isabel II of Spain sent representatives to the desert to purchase Arabian horses and by 1847 had established a stud book; her successor, King Alfonso XII imported additional bloodstock from other European nations. By 1893, the state military stud farm, Yeguada Militar was established in Córdoba, Spain for breeding both Arabian and Iberian horses. The military remained heavily involved in the importation and breeding of Arabians in Spain well into the early 20th century, and the Yeguada Militar is still in existence today.|$|E
5|$|Frontier {{physician}} Andrew Taylor Still, M.D., DO, {{founded the}} American School of Osteopathy (now the A.T. Still University-Kirksville (Mo.) College of Osteopathic Medicine) in Kirksville, MO, in 1892 as a radical {{protest against the}} turn-of-the-century medical system. A. T. Still believed that the conventional medical system lacked credible efficacy, was morally corrupt, and treated effects rather than causes of disease. He founded osteopathic medicine in rural Missouri {{at a time when}} medications, surgery, and other traditional therapeutic regimens often caused more harm than good. Some of the medicines commonly given to patients during this time were arsenic, castor oil, whiskey, and opium. In addition, unsanitary surgical practices often <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> deaths than cures.|$|E

The total medal count, 47, is also the fourth highest Great Britain has ever achieved, with only the 1908, 2012 and 2016 Games resulting in more medals. Following retests of doping samples in 2016 {{in connection with the}} Russian doping scandal, 4 further medals, all bronze, are expected to be awarded in athletics, retrospectively bringing the total gained to 51. As of October 2017, the award of the bronze medals to the Men's and Women's 4 x 400 metres relay teams has brought the official medal total to 49. Goldie Sayers and Kelly Sotherton await reallocation of further medals.|$|E
5|$|In {{supplying}} this demand, the ice trade increasingly shifted north, {{away from}} Massachusetts and towards Maine. Various factors contributed to this. New Englands' winters became warmer during the 19th century, while industrialisation <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> {{of the natural}} ponds and rivers becoming contaminated. Less trade was brought through New England as other ways of reaching western US markets were opened up, making it less profitable to trade ice from Boston, while the cost of producing ships in the region increased due to deforestation. Finally, in 1860 there {{was the first of}} four ice famines along the Hudson-warm winters that prevented the formation of ice in New England-creating shortages and driving up prices.|$|E
5|$|Sea lions are {{particularly}} intelligent, {{can be trained}} to perform various tasks and display limited fear of humans if accustomed to them. Because of this, California sea lions are a popular choice for public display in zoos, circuses and oceanariums, and are trained by the United States Navy for certain military operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as Least Concern due to its abundance. Predation by California sea lions on threatened or endangered salmon species at Bonneville Dam has <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> than 50 of them being killed by state officials.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the early}} 19th century the Everglades {{have been a}} subject of {{interest}} for agricultural development. The first attempt to drain the Everglades occurred in 1882 when a Pennsylvania land developer named Hamilton Disston constructed the first canals. Though these attempts were largely unsuccessful, Disston's purchase of land spurred tourism and real estate development of the state. The political motivations of Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> successful attempts at canal construction between 1906 and 1920. Recently reclaimed wetlands were used for cultivating sugarcane and vegetables, while urban development began in the Everglades.|$|E

The Filitti Archive, preserved by Manole Filitti, {{was divided into}} separate funds, and divided between several institutions: the Romanian Academy Library, the National Archives, the Cotroceni Palace collection, and the Ialomița County Museum. Selections from the historian's diaries were published by Georgeta Filitti as fascicles in the academic review Revista Istorică, during the early 1990s. Beginning 2008, she published the diary in book form, with the Ialomița Museum press and Cetatea de Scaun company of Târgoviște.|$|E

Once negotiations failed, the complex was stormed and {{captured by the}} Pakistan Army's Special Service Group. The government reported that the operation resulted in 154 deaths, and 50 militants were captured (other estimates were higher). It also prompted pro-Taliban rebels along the Afghan border to nullify a 10-month-old peace agreement with the Pakistani Government. This event triggered the Third Waziristan War, which marked another surge in militancy and violence in Pakistan and has <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> than 3,000 casualties.|$|E

The below-average activity was also reflected in an unusually low number of damaging storms. Only two systems, Trina and Waka, had significant effects on land. The former caused extensive flooding on Mangaia while the latter was {{regarded as one of the}} most damaging storms in the history of Tonga. Approximately $51.3million in damage was attributed to Waka as well as an indirect fatality, the only tropical cyclone-related death of the year, due to cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Lidia was a deadly, {{destructive}} {{tropical cyclone}} {{that occurred during}} the 1981 Pacific hurricane season. It <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> casualties and caused greater damage than Hurricane Norma, which took place later that season. On October 6, a tropical depression formed and strengthened into a tropical storm six hours later. Lidia brushed the Gulf of California coast of Baja California Sur and made landfall just south of Los Mochis in Sinaloa on October 8. Tropical Storm Lidia rapidly weakened and dissipated the same day. Lidia killed at least 73 people and caused at least $80 million (1981 USD) which is equivalent to $193 million (2010 USD) in damage. It inflicted heavy rain and flooding throughout parts of northwestern Mexico, especially Sinaloa.|$|E
5|$|From about 71 CE the Romans began {{military}} expeditions {{into what}} is now Scotland, building forts, like that at Trimontium, and probably pushing north {{as far as the}} River Tay where they created more fortifications, like those at Inchtuthil. These were soon abandoned, and the Romans settled for the occupation of the Southern Uplands {{by the end of the}} first century, below a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. This <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> fortifications and the building of Hadrian's Wall across what is now northern England. Around 141 CE they moved up to construct a new limes, a -covered wall made of turf known as the Antonine Wall, the largest Roman structure in modern Scotland. They soon retreated to Hadrian's Wall, with occasional expeditions that involved the building and reoccupation of forts, until the collapse of Roman power in the early fifth century.|$|E
