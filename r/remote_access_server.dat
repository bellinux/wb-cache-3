5000|$|Pfeiffer {{also made}} several major (and some minor) {{acquisition}}s. In 1997, Compaq bought Tandem Computers, {{known for their}} NonStop server line. This acquisition instantly gave Compaq {{a presence in the}} higher end business computing market. Minor acquisitions centered around building a networking arm and included NetWorth (1998) based in Irving, Texas and Thomas-Conrad (1998) based in Austin, Texas. [...] In 1997 Microcom was also acquired, based in Norwood, MA, which brought a line of modems, <b>Remote</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Servers</b> (RAS) and the popular Carbon Copy software.|$|R
40|$|Owing to {{the growing}} {{concerns}} over data confidentiality, many national statistical agencies are considering <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> <b>servers</b> to disseminate data to the public. With remote servers, users submit requests for output from statistical models fit using the collected data, {{but they are not}} allowed access to the data. Remote servers also should enable users to check the fit of their models; however, standard diagnostics like residuals or influence statistics can disclose individual data values. In this article, we present diagnostics for categorical data regressions that can be safely and usefully employed in remote servers. We illustrate the diagnostics with simulation studies...|$|R
50|$|A {{broadband}} <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> <b>server</b> (BRAS, B-RAS or BBRAS) routes {{traffic to}} and from broadband remote access devices such as digital subscriber line access multiplexers (DSLAM) on an Internet service provider's (ISP) network.

5000|$|During {{the early}} '90s the company grew its range of {{networking}} products to include terminal <b>servers,</b> <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> <b>servers,</b> Ethernet switches, enterprise hubs, routers, etc.. When Cisco became the dominant {{player in the}} enterprise networking area, the company was sold to Raytheon, which, in 1995, was considering building a commercial data communications division through acquisition. After a year of investigating {{a number of other}} companies they decided that the market valuations were too high to comfortably return their investment and Xyplex was sold in 1997 to Whittaker Communications. The company had also purchased Hughes LAN Systems and merged both companies.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{collaboration}} systems {{require a}} server computer, which maintains {{copies of the}} documents for <b>remote</b> <b>access.</b> The <b>server</b> computer may be operated by the organization owning the documents, or outsourced to some service.

5000|$|At the MSC, it is {{possible}} to use a modem to convert to an [...] "analog" [...] signal, though this will typically actually be encoded as a digital pulse-code modulation (PCM) signal when sent from the MSC. It is also possible to directly use the digital signal as an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) data signal and feed it into the equivalent of a <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E
50|$|DECserver 90M+The DECserver 90M+ was {{introduced}} in 2003. A full function asynchronous device and <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> <b>server,</b> it provides eight local or remote asynchronous RJ45 connections over Ethernet LANs. Internal flash is 4 MB. Memory is 8 MB. This product also supports upgradeable ROM code. The DECserver 90M+ supports up to eight sessions per port. It runs DECserver Network Access Software (DNAS). Unlike the DECserver 90M models, the DECserver 90M+ {{does not have a}} BNC connector. Speeds were increased to 230.4 kbit/s.|$|E
50|$|The DSLAM {{acts like}} a network switch since its {{functionality}} is at Layer 2 of the OSI model. Therefore, it cannot re-route traffic between multiple IP networks, only between ISP devices and end-user connection points. The DSLAM traffic is switched to a Broadband <b>Remote</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Server</b> where the end-user traffic is then routed across the ISP network to the Internet. Customer-premises equipment that interfaces well with the DSLAM {{to which it is}} connected may take advantage of enhanced telephone voice and data line signaling features and the bandwidth monitoring and compensation capabilities it supports.|$|E

40|$|In an {{evolutionary}} metro network scenario, it is proposed to adopt flexi-grid technologies and centralize the IP functionality, locating the Broadband <b>Remote</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Servers</b> (BRASes) in fewer sites {{of a regional}} photonic mesh network, {{in order to reduce}} CapEx. Therefore, cost-effective data plane solutions, able to support multiple low bit rate connections, using 12. 5 GHz channels, are required for this network segment. In this paper, we present a cost-effective bandwidth variable transponder (BVT) based on OFDM technology suitable for flexi-grid metropolitan area network (MAN), using low-complexity digital signal processing (DSP) and direct detection (DD). The design guidelines are provided for this data plane solution, which has been numerically analyzed and experimentally validated in a photonic mesh network. Furthermore, a sliceable BVT architecture is proposed for enhancing the capacity of the BRAS node in order to serve several Multi-Tenant Units (MTUs) ...|$|R

50|$|L2TP {{is often}} used by ISPs when {{internet}} service over for example ADSL or cable is being resold. From the end user, packets travel over a wholesale network service provider's network to a server called a Broadband <b>Remote</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Server</b> (BRAS), a protocol converter and router combined. On legacy networks the path from end user customer premises' equipment to the BRAS may be over an ATM network. From there on, over an IP network, an L2TP tunnel runs from the BRAS (acting as LAC) to an LNS which is an edge router at the boundary of the ultimate destination ISP's IP network. See example of reseller ISPs using L2TP.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike its predecessors, Windows Server 2012 {{can switch}} between [...] "Server Core" [...] and server with a DE {{installation}} option without reinstallation. Server Core {{is now the}} default configuration level. There is also a new installation option, [...] "minimal server interface" [...] that allows some GUI elements such as MMC and Server Manager to run, but without the normal desktop, shell or default programs like File Explorer. The [...] "minimal server interface" [...] {{is in fact a}} server role (Server-Gui-Mgmt-Infra), the full GUI version contains the Server-Gui-Shell role as well. Some new roles are available, like Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Active Directory Rights Management Server, and Routing and <b>Remote</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Server,</b> and many new features as well.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} an ADSL access network consisting of subscribers, DSLAMs, metro Ethernet switches and a broadband <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> aggregation <b>server</b> (BRAS). We obtain expressions for dimensioning the access {{network in the}} upstream direction. Specifically, we show that the bandwidth required at each DSLAM, metro Ethernet switch, and BRAS can be expressed as an exponential function of the subscribers in a log scale {{when the number of}} subscribers does not surpass a certain value. After this value, it grows linearly {{as a function of the}} subscribers...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we took {{a closer}} look at the Red Pitaya {{measurement}} system with some of its basic tools. We developed a <b>Remote</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Server</b> for access, reservation and control of Red Pitaya systems. We integrated the existing Red Pitaya's SCPI server into the <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> <b>server</b> and added a feature for writing small SCPI compatible programs. We developed a program for accessing FPGA registers on the Red Pitaya, and integrated it with our <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> <b>server.</b> In the scope of this project we also created a simple Red Pitaya application on the base of existing Red Pitaya's Oscilloscope and Generator frameworks. We added a basic feature for turning on and off LED diodes, and a feature for saving data about acquired signals, which can be viewed and deleted remotely. The server also supports adding users and Red Pitaya measurement systems to the database. At the end, we explained how to use Nginx to deploy our application...|$|E
