5|$|During that period, general {{relativity}} remained {{something of a}} curiosity among physical theories. It was clearly superior to Newtonian gravity, being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory. Einstein himself had shown in 1915 how his theory explained the anomalous perihelion advance of the planet Mercury without any arbitrary parameters (""). Similarly, a 1919 expedition led by Eddington confirmed {{general relativity}}'s prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, making Einstein instantly famous. Yet the theory entered the mainstream of theoretical physics and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, {{now known as the}} golden age of general relativity. Physicists began to understand the concept of a black hole, and to identify quasars as one of these objects' astrophysical manifestations. Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power, and <b>relativistic</b> <b>cosmology,</b> too, became amenable to direct observational tests.|$|E
5|$|The Einstein field {{equations}} are nonlinear {{and very}} difficult to solve. Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. But as early as 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the Schwarzschild metric. This solution {{laid the groundwork for}} the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to electrically charged objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the Reissner–Nordström solution, now associated with electrically charged black holes. In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole, initiating the field of <b>relativistic</b> <b>cosmology.</b> In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations—the cosmological constant—to match that observational presumption. By 1929, however, the work of Hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding. This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by Friedmann in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant. Lemaître used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the Big Bang models, in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state. Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.|$|E

40|$|Cosmological N-body {{simulations}} are {{now being}} performed using Newtonian gravity on scales larger than the Hubble radius. It {{is well known that}} a uniformly expanding, homogeneous ball of dust in Newtonian gravity satisfies the same equations as arise in <b>relativistic</b> FLRW <b>cosmology,</b> and it also is known that a correspondence between Newtonian and <b>relativistic</b> dust <b>cosmologies</b> continues to hold in linearized perturbation theory in the marginally bound/spatially flat case. Nevertheless, it is far from obvious that Newtonian gravity can provide a good global description of an inhomogeneous cosmology when there is significant nonlinear dynamical behavior at small scales. We investigate this issue in the light of a perturbative framework that we have recently developed, which allows for such nonlinearity at small scales. We propose a relatively straightforward "dictionary" [...] -which is exact at the linearized level [...] -that maps Newtonian dust <b>cosmologies</b> into general <b>relativistic</b> dust <b>cosmologies,</b> and we use our "ordering scheme" to determine {{the degree to which the}} resulting metric and matter distribution solve Einstein's equation. We find that Einstein's equation fails to hold at "order 1 " at small scales and at "order ϵ" at large scales. We then find the additional corrections to the metric and matter distribution needed to satisfy Einstein's equation to these orders. While these corrections are of some interest in their own right, our main purpose in calculating them is that their smallness should provide a criterion for the validity of the original dictionary (as well as simplified versions of this dictionary). We expect that, in realistic Newtonian cosmologies, these additional corrections will be very small; if so, this should provide strong justification for the use of Newtonian simulations to describe <b>relativistic</b> <b>cosmologies,</b> even on scales larger than the Hubble radius.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the issue of}} characterizing the coherent large-scale patterns from CMB temperature maps in globally anisotropic cosmologies. The methods we investigate are reasonably general; the particular models we test them on are the homogeneous but anisotropic <b>relativistic</b> <b>cosmologies</b> described by the Bianchi classification. Although the temperature variations produced in these models are not stochastic, they {{give rise to a}} "non-Gaussian" distribution of temperature fluctuations over the sky that is a partial diagnostic of the model. We explore two methods for quantifying non-Gaussian and/or non-stationary fluctuation fields in order to see how they respond to the Bianchi models. We first investigate the behavior of phase correlations between the spherical harmonic modes of the maps. Then we examine the behavior of the multipole vectors of the temperature distribution which, though defined in harmonic space, can indicate the presence of a preferred direction in real space, i. e. on the 2 -sphere. These methods give extremely clear signals of the presence of anisotropy when applied to the models we discuss, suggesting that they have some promise as diagnostics of the presence of global asymmetry in the Universe.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{near the}} initial {{state of the}} anisotropy parameter of the arbitrary type, homogeneous and anisotropic Blanchi models is considered {{in the framework of}} the braneworld cosmological models. The matter content on the brane is assumed to be an isotropic perfect cosmological fluid obeying a barotropic equation of state. To obtain the value of the anisotropy parameter at an arbitrary moment an evolution equation is derived, describing the dynamics of the anisotropy {{as a function of the}} volume scale factor of the universe. The general solution of this equation can be obtained in an exact analytical form for the Bianchi I and V types and in a closed form for all other homogeneous and anisotropic geometries. The study of the values of the anisotropy in the limit of small times shows that for all Bianchi-type spacetimes filled with a non-zero pressure cosmological fluid, obeying a linear barotropic equation of state, the initial singular state on the brane is isotropic. This result is obtained by assuming that in the limit of small times the asymptotic behaviour of the scale factors is of Kasner-type.

50|$|In <b>relativistic</b> <b>cosmology</b> {{using the}} Lagrangian {{threading}} dynamics of Ehlers (1971) and Ellis (1971) it is usual {{to use the}} gauge-invariant covariant perturbation theory developed by Hawking (1966) and Ellis and Bruni (1989). Here rather than starting with a background and perturbing away from that background one starts with full general relativity and systematically reduces the theory down to one that is linear around a particular background. The approach is local and both covariant as well as gauge invariant but can be non-linear because the approach is built around the local comoving observer frame (see frame bundle) {{which is used to}} thread the entire space-time. This approach to perturbation theory produces differential equations that are of just the right order needed to describe the true physical degrees of freedom and as such no non-physical gauge modes exist. It is usual to express the theory in a coordinate free manner. For applications of kinetic theory, because one is required to use the full tangent bundle, it becomes convenient to use the tetrad formulation of <b>relativistic</b> <b>cosmology.</b> The application of this approach to the computation of anisotropies in cosmic microwave background radiation requires the linearization of the full relativistic kinetic theory developed by Thorne (1980) and Ellis, Matravers and Treciokas (1983).|$|E
