40|$|Refusals are a {{significant}} source of non-response in surveys. During field periods of some surveys <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusals</b> are collected in call record data (as part of para-data). This article presents a study employing a content analysis of open-ended comments on <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusals</b> collected by interviewers in a survey of the German population (ALLBUS). We analysed the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusals</b> contained in these comments, as well as to what extent these comments include information about factors relevant to participation in surveys. Additionally, we analysed the impact of interviewer characteristics – gender, age, education and experience – on data collection using various multilevel multinomial models. The results show that interviewer comments provide typical <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusals,</b> as well as specific information about target persons, their environment and the survey process. Interviewers' age and education influenced the collection of <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusals.</b> At the same time interviewer variances (obtained through multinomial multilevel models) were very high, showing that interviewers prefer to report certain <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusals.</b> The highest interviewer level variances were obtained for providing no comments at all. To improve data quality and reduce high interviewer impact, we suggest using improved standardised instruments to collect <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusals.</b> Codings based on a categorisation scheme which we developed for our content analysis show high reliability (kappa =. 81). Thus, this scheme {{can be used as a}} basis for developing such standardised instruments. " (author's abstract...|$|R

50|$|Totemistic taboo {{is also a}} {{possible}} <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusal</b> to eat horse meat as an everyday food, but did not necessarily preclude ritual slaughter and consumption. Roman sources state that the goddess Epona was widely worshipped in Gaul and southern Britain. Epona, a triple-aspect goddess, was the protectress of the horse and horse keepers, and horses were sacrificed to her; she was paralleled by the Irish Macha and Welsh Rhiannon. In The White Goddess, Robert Graves argued that the taboo among Britons and their descendants was due to worship of Epona, and even earlier rites. The Uffington White Horse is probable evidence of ancient horse worship. The ancient Indian Kshatriyas engaged in horse sacrifice (Ashwamedh Yaghya) as recorded in the Vedas and Ramayana; but within context of the ritual sacrificial is not being 'killed' but instead being smothered to death. In 1913, the Finnic Mari people of the Volga region were observed to practice a horse sacrifice.|$|E

5000|$|Vice-chancellor {{designate}} Joseph Sung, {{who was out}} of town, but was consulted on the vote, {{admitted that}} it was the biggest political storm in 21 years. He said he was opposed to invoking political neutrality as the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusal,</b> and that others shared that view. He added that the management team was [...] "immature" [...] and [...] "inexperienced" [...] in handling the incident, and pledged improved communication and dialogue with students {{on the future of the}} statue when he takes up the post next month. [...] "It was never the committee's intention to reject the request completely. We have thought about allowing some flexibility, such as putting the statue on the campus temporarily. But after the statement was issued, the students reacted very strongly and stopped talking to us. I agree that our handling of the matter was immature." [...] Joseph Sung An editorial in The Standard criticised the board's naivety in not anticipating the reaction from students and politicians. It was also highly critical that Sung had sought to distance himself from the decision with such a [...] "lame excuse". Following Sung's remarks, outgoing vice-chancellor Lawrence Lau defended the committee's decision as [...] "collective and unanimous", seemingly at odds with Sung's assertion the previous day that there were dissenting voices to the ban. He also disagreed with Sung's view that the decision taken was 'immature and inexperienced', as the matter had received 'detailed consideration'. The University attempted to soften the rift at the top with a statement from Sung that he acknowledged and agreed with the stance in the statement of rejecting the application, issued on 2 June but only [...] "had different views on the wording." [...] Apple Daily commented that the disquiet among board members over Sung's comments forced a hasty retraction; it suggested his lack of management's support, the result of internal politics and the power base cultivated by Lau, did not bode well for his authority. The students union pointed out to inconsistencies in the respective accounts of Lau and Sung, and said the two professors should have communicated to reach a consensus; Lau's reply [...] "failed to explain why the school used political neutrality as a reason to reject the statue." [...] The union said it had requested a meeting with the dean of students on Monday to seek talks with the governance team, but the request was rejected as the team had to deal with the public relations matters.|$|E

The theory is structured around power-dependence and integrates legitimacy and attribution notions with previous theories of tactical action.

This aspect of bisphosphonate intolerability is being thoroughly investigated since some representatives of this drug group are able to induce very serious specific complications, such as esophageal ulcers, in addition to nonspecific symptoms (dyspepsia or gastralgia).

40|$|More {{knowledge}} on the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusal</b> of the influenza vaccine in elderly patients {{is essential to}} target groups for additional information, and hence improve coverage rate. The objective {{of the present study}} was to describe precisely the true motives <b>for</b> <b>refusal.</b> All patients aged over 64 who attended the Medical Outpatient Clinic, University of Lausanne, or their private practitioner's office during the 1999 and 2000 vaccination periods were included. Each patient was informed on influenza and its complications, as well as on the need for vaccination, its efficacy and adverse events. The vaccination was then proposed. In case of refusal, the reasons were investigated with an open question. Out of 1398 patients, 148 (12 %) refused the vaccination. The main <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusal</b> were the perception of being in good health (16 %), of not being susceptible to influenza (15 %), of not having had the influenza vaccine in the past (15 %), of having had a bad experience either personally or a relative (15 %), and the uselessness of the vaccine (10 %). Seventeen percent gave miscellaneous reasons and 12 % no <b>reason</b> at all <b>for</b> <b>refusal.</b> Little epidemiological knowledge and resistance to change appear to be the major obstacles for wide acceptance of the vaccine by the elderly...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Organ {{transplantation}} in Libya depends {{exclusively on}} donations from live relatives. This limitation increases mortality and prolongs the patients’ suffering and waiting time. Objectives:The aims {{of this study}} were to explore willingness to donate organs after death and to identify the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusal.</b> Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to July 2008 on a cluster sample of 1652 persons (58 % males and 42 % females). The questionnaire included demographic information and mainly enquired about willingness to donate organs after death and the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusal</b> when applicable. Results: About one-third (29. 7 %) of participants were in favor of donating their organs after death, 60. 1 % refused and 10. 2 % were undecided. Willingness was significantly associated with being male, younger age, having a college or graduate degree, and being single (P < 0. 05 for all). Lack of adequate knowledge about the importance of deceased organ donation and uncertainty about its religious implications were the most predominant <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusal</b> (43. 8 % and 39. 5 %, respectively). Other reasons included ethical concerns about retrieving organs from dead bodies (37. 9 %), preference for being buried intact (28 %), and uneasiness about the idea of cadaver manipulation (33 %). Conclusion: There were a considerable resistance to deceased organ donation, especially among females, those of older age, married people, and those with a low education level. The barriers to cadaveric donations were lack of adequate knowledge, unease about body manipulation, and concerns about religious implications. Public educational campaigns should be coordinated with religious leadership...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe aim to {{determine}} influenza vaccination uptake {{among people with}} diabetes included in the MADIABETES cohort study {{in order to identify}} predictors of uptake and to analyze reasons for adherence and non-adherence with vaccination. MethodsUsing data from the MADIABETES Study we conducted a retrospective case record form based study without controls. We included outpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Information was obtained from computerized clinical records and by telephone survey. The main dependent variables were influenza vaccination uptake in the year 2013 and the reason for receiving or refusing vaccination. ResultsOverall, 65. 7 % had received the influenza vaccine in 2013. The mean number of influenza vaccines received from 2007 to 2013 was 3. 24 (SD 1. 15), although 19. 23 % had not received any influenza vaccine and 23. 3 % had been vaccinated against pneumococcus. The variables that increased the probability of being vaccinated were inclusion in the age-based recommendation (⩾ 60 years), having a chronic respiratory disease, previous pneumococcal vaccination, higher number of visits to the general practitioner, higher number of influenza vaccines, and longer time since diabetes diagnosis. A higher mean glycated haemoglobin value in 2013 was associated with a reduced probability of vaccination. Most patients (90 %) agreed to be vaccinated following their physician’s advice because of their age or their chronic conditions. The most common <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusal</b> among men was the belief that they were not at risk (41. 6 % vs. 29. 79 % in women); the most common <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>refusal</b> among women was fear of adverse reactions (32. 53 % vs. 20. 23 % in men). ConclusionsThe uptake of influenza vaccination among diabetic patients {{in the present study was}} below desirable levels. The main barrier to vaccination was lack of knowledge regarding the need for and risks and advantages of influenza vaccination. Healthcare professionals should educate and encourage influenza vaccination among people with diabetes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyse and discuss the {{ethically}} problematic conflict raised by patients with stroke who refuse nutritional treatment. In analysing this conflict, the focus is on four different aspects: (1) Is nutritional treatment biologically necessary?

(3) If the latter, what values are involved in the conflict? (4) How should we deal with the different kinds of refusal of nutritional treatment? We argue that patients' autonomy should be respected as far as possible, while also considering that those who have suffered a stroke might re-evaluate their life as a result of a beneficial prognosis. However, if patients persist with their refusal, health care professionals should force nutritional treatment only when it is clear that the patients will re-evaluate their future life...|$|E
