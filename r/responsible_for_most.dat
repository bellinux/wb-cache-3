5|$|Subduction of the Nazca Plate {{beneath the}} South America plate is <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of the {{volcanism}} in the Central Volcanic Zone. After {{activity in the}} western Maricunga Belt volcanic arc ceased six million years ago, volcanism started up in the Incapillo region, forming the high volcanoes Monte Pissis, Cerro Bonete Chico and Sierra de Veladero. Later, a number of lava domes formed between these volcanoes.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, {{released}} in 2012, ranked and rated Indian bureaucracy as the worst in Asia with a 9.21 rating out of 10. According to the study, India's inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of the complaints that business executive have about the country. A paper prepared in 2012 by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions states that corruption is prevalent at all levels in civil services and it is institutionalised.|$|E
5|$|Equally as important, the Union Stockyards {{were founded}} in 1883. Within {{twenty years of}} the {{founding}} of the Union Stockyards in South Omaha, four of the five major meatpacking companies in the United States were located in Omaha. By the 1950s, half the city's workforce was employed in meatpacking and processing.

5|$|From 1859 to 1865, Kogălniceanu was {{on several}} {{occasions}} the cabinet leader in the Moldavian half of the United Principalities, then Prime Minister of Romania, being <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of the reforms associated with Cuza's reign. His first term in Moldavia ended during December 1860, when Kogălniceanu {{became involved in the}} scandal involving Metropolitan Sofronie Miclescu, who opposed Cuza's secularization of the monastery estates. In 1863, secularization was imposed by Cuza, with the land thus freed being divided among peasants—the land reform of 1864, which came together with the universal abolition of corvées.|$|E
5|$|Jones is <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of the band's artwork concepts.

5|$|Matsueda {{is noted}} for her jazzy style, which she often {{incorporated}} into the soundtracks she worked on; she also touched on genres like jazz fusion, lounge, and ambient. For the scores that she collaborated on with Eguchi, she was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of the jazzy tracks, while Eguchi provided {{the majority of the}} electronic music. Matsueda has said that the best qualities of a composer are their curiosity and sensitivity, and that watching many things, listening, touching, and feeling are important factors in composition.

They will upload and download data with Stanford's Folding@home data servers (over port8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit digital signatures. While the client's graphical user interface (GUI) is open-source, the client is proprietary software citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.|$|E
5|$|Rebellion {{broke out}} in late June 1848, after Frățias members came to adopt a single project {{regarding}} the promise of land reform. This resolution, which had initially caused dissension, was passed into the revolutionary program upon pressures from Nicolae Bălcescu and his supporters. The document itself, destined to {{be read as a}} proclamation, was most likely drafted by Heliade Rădulescu, and Bălcescu himself was possibly <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of its ideas. It called for, among other issues, national independence, civil rights and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, responsible government, a five-year term of office for Princes and their election by the Assembly, freedom of the press, and decentralization.|$|E
5|$|The Office of Information Technology, or OIT, manages {{most of the}} Institute's {{computing}} resources (and some related services such as campus telephones).

Student, faculty, and staff e-mail accounts are among its services. Georgia Tech's ResNet provides free technical support to all students and guests living in Georgia Tech's on-campus housing (excluding fraternities and sororities).

Fraser and Navarro write {{that at one point}} the Sociedad had been an enlightened institution, caring for orphans and homeless women, but that those days had long since passed {{by the time of the}} first term of Juan Perón. In the 1800s, the Sociedad had been supported by private contributions, largely those of the husbands of the society ladies. But by the 1940s, the Sociedad was supported by the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the jack jumper sting problem differs among areas. Allergy {{prevalence}} rates are significantly lower in highly urbanised areas and much higher in rural areas. These ants represent a hazard towards people in the southern states of Australia, due to {{a high proportion of}} the population having significant allergies to the ant's sting. The ant is a significant cause of major insect allergies, <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> anaphylaxis cases in Australia, and rates of anaphylaxis are twice those of honeybee stings. One in three million annually die of general anaphalaxis in Australia alone. Over 90% of Australian ant venom allergies have been caused by the jack jumper.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} protons in the nucleus defines to what {{chemical}} element the atom belongs: for example, all copper atoms contain 29 protons. The number of neutrons defines the isotope of the element. The number of electrons influences the magnetic properties of an atom. Atoms can attach {{to one or}} more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules. The ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of the physical changes observed in nature and is the subject of the discipline of chemistry.|$|E

5|$|The {{skin of a}} giraffe {{is mostly}} gray. Its {{thickness}} allows the animal to run through thorn bush without being punctured. The fur {{may serve as a}} chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of the smell. Because the males have a stronger odour than the females, the odour may also have sexual function. Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one-metre (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.|$|E
5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of the adrenaline that circulates in the body, {{but only for a}} small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the prior}} {{introduction}} of the Princess Royal class had provided the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with more powerful locomotives to be used on the main line between London Euston and Glasgow Central, {{the board of directors}} were persuaded in 1936 that more such locomotives would be needed, particularly as they were being asked to approve the introduction of a new non-stop service between those cities, designated the Coronation Scot. Initially, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, William Stanier, planned to build five more Princess Royals, but the Chief Technical Assistant and Chief Draughtsman at the LMS Derby Works, Tom Coleman, argued that it would be preferable to design a new class of locomotive that was more powerful, more reliable and easier to maintain. Stanier was convinced and the drawing office commenced designing the new class. When Stanier was called on to perform an assignment in India, Coleman became <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of the detailed design in his absence.|$|E
