40|$|The Italian {{administrative}} bodies and planning agencies have embraced with mixed feedbacks {{the introduction of}} Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) through the European Directive 2001 / 42 /EC. Concurrently, regional and local spatial planning practice have been characterized by a new approach inspired by landscape planning. The Italian region of Sardinia {{has been one of}} the pioneering {{administrative bodies}} in the Italian and European arena that has adopted landscape principles for the construction <b>of</b> its regional <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> (PPR, Piano Paesaggistico Regionale). Municipalities are now carrying out the <b>review</b> <b>of</b> their <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> to the PPR's prescriptions and indications. Against this background, the aim of this paper is to assess the level of SEA implementation in the municipal <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> <b>of</b> Sardinia, six years after the approval of the PPR. Rooted in the SEA international literature we construct a modular and adaptable on-line survey for officers involved in the <b>review</b> <b>of</b> municipal <b>master</b> <b>plans.</b> The results show that many Sardinian municipalities have not reviewed their <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> to the PPR's regulations yet and only a few municipalities have started this review process according to the SEA procedure...|$|R
50|$|Out {{of concern}} for the {{residential}} growth during the 1970s and its effects on the entire township, the Planning Commission embarked on a comprehensive <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Master</b> <b>Plan</b> and the Zoning Map in the early 1980s. As a result, the revised <b>Master</b> <b>Plan</b> and Zoning Ordinance incorporated natural resource protection information and standards. This slowed the growth of Springfield Township during the decade, growing to 9,927 in 1990. Additional comprehensive reviews and updates were done in the early 1990s and again in 2002. The primary basis for the township’s planning, zoning and land use decisions for at least the last 20 years has been the protection and preservation of their abundant and very special natural resources.|$|R
50|$|Thailand has {{identified}} iodine deficiency and has implemented programs to have iodized salt (universal salt iodization) within the country. However, with shifting priorities, {{the effectiveness of}} programs can change and in 2004 the director-general of the Department of Health of the Ministry of Health, Thailand, requested the Network for the Sustained Elimination of Iodine Deﬁciency to undertake an external <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the Thai IDD programme, which was led by Eastman. This program developed numerous recommendations in program policy and management: salt production and iodization; monitoring, surveillance and quality assurance; advocacy and communication. In 2006 the National IDD Control Board (NIDDCB) met, presided over by HRH the Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn to develop an IDD 5 Year <b>Master</b> <b>Plan</b> based on the 2004 report. In 2009 a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> was undertaken. While progress had been made, universal salt iodization remained a problem and 17 additional recommendations were made. A further review was completed in 2013. For his work in assisting in the elimination of IDD in Thailand Eastman was awarded the 2014 Health Promotion Princess Award.|$|R

These projects include, among other things, {{the construction of new}} towns, industrial areas, power plants, highways, hospitals, waterfront projects and sanitary projects. All of these projects are well known to have adverse environmental impacts unless necessary precautions are taken in their planning stages. As per Article 8 of Law 21 of 1995 and its amendments, the proponents of such projects are requested to submit a comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) document for review before an environmental permit is given by the Environment Public Authority (EPA) in Kuwait.

40|$|The {{study area}} {{comprises}} the urban watersheds in Boa Esperança-MG, which have several {{social and environmental}} problems due to human action. Pollution, siltation and eutrophication of streams, along with the disorderly occupation of permanent preservation areas are the main problems observed. In the study area formed the Encantos lake, portion of the Furnas Hydroelectric Power Plant reservoir, widely used for recreation, sports and fishing activities. This study conducted environmental analysis of the mentioned river basins, through the analysis of qualitative aspects of stream, land use, environmental degradation and areas subject to flooding. The results show that urbanization affected the Areas of Permanent Preservation, damaging the environmental and health quality of these environments, resulting in issues that may directly affect public health. From this analysis it was recommended the establishment of corrective and preventive actions, such as the revitalization of the environment, the creation and expansion of municipal parks, creating bicycle paths and educational activities involving the community. For these actions to succeed, the <b>review</b> process <b>of</b> the <b>master</b> <b>plan,</b> should include guidelines related to environmental conservation.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{population}} growth and housing development in developing countries is usually {{a consequence of the}} push of the rural areas and the pull of the town. The growth and physical expansion of cities have been accompanied by unplanned urban sprawl, environmental pollution, deterioration, deficiencies in modern basic facilities, and general urban decay. Urban expansion without effective environmental consciousness means that in virtually every urban center – from large cities and metropolitan areas to regional centers and small market towns – a substantial proportion of the population is at risk from natural and human-induced environmental hazards. A strategic approach is essential if urban areas are to enjoy all the benefits which nature can bring. A total of 200 copies of questionnaires were administered at the neighbourhood zones I, II, III and IV of peri-urban Nyanya town for the purpose of assessing the impact of urbanization towards the suburb in other to ascertain its general environmental condition on the surrounding landscape. The study examines the environmental consequences of socioeconomic and other activities in a bid to determine how sustainable Abuja’s urbanization is. The study reveals that, the city is growing faster than in the provisions <b>of</b> its <b>master</b> <b>plan.</b> It is fast turning into an environmental embarrassment, with developments springing up in gross violation of zoning and other planning codes. Abuja, which was supposed to be an epitome of beauty and an enlightened vision of city development, has suffered over the years from unnecessary distortions in the implementation <b>of</b> its <b>master</b> <b>plan.</b> The paper concludes by suggesting pragmatic strategies for achieving an integrated and ecologically balanced environment. Therefore, this paper recommends the <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the Abuja <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> for every five years to reflect the garden city concept and neighbourhood design for sustainable city living and mitigating the serious negative impacts of urbanizatio...|$|R
40|$|For a long time, public {{participation}} in urban mobility policies has been weak in Rome, {{confined to a}} technical practice. However, {{in the last few}} years, in the wake <b>of</b> new <b>Master</b> <b>Plan</b> participation rules and new EU funds for participatory processes, an increasing number of administrative districts called "Municipi" are developing a more participatory approach, particularly in the field of local urban mobility. Even if this has not led to the formal signature of a "Mobility Agreement" between the local Government and local associations, the movements of inhabitants and local associations have succeeded in developing a set of proposals, which are being influential for the development of local political programs and day-to-day mobility policies (about public and private transport, cycling and pedestrian mobility). In particular, this paper will show opportunities and constraints of the participation processes in urban mobility planning in two case studies comparing effects, achievements and participatory technical methods: the project "Sbilanciamoci per la Mobilità" in the historical I Municipio, promoted by "Casa della Città", the first experiment of an Urban Center in Rome; the participatory <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the Cycling <b>Master</b> <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> Rome in IX Municipio. The paper analyses two aspects: 1 - The effects and results of these initiatives in central and local governance policies in the field of urban mobility, identifying to what extent decision-making processes are being reinforced, or weakened, by sharing the definition of objectives, different monitoring and revision processes. 2 - The role that appropriate participatory technical methods play within general urban mobility strategies at different scales, improving resources for technical assistance and for transparent process, reducing conflicts with local stakeholders. © 2012 WIT Press...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} three decades, a number <b>of</b> <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> {{communities}} (MPCs) have been developed in South East Queensland (SEQ) {{as part of the}} response to the housing demands of rapid population growth. Developers, state government, local councils and communities play key roles in the production and management of infrastructure and community services in these Masterplanned communities. Alongside rising community expectations regarding quality of services, there is an increasing trend for developers to be involved in either the direct provision of infrastructure, or its funding, with local councils and the state government playing a facilitating role in provision of services alongside their more traditional role of direct provision. It is imperative to understand the governance structures as well as governance challenges <b>of</b> <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> communities at different stages of development. The objectives of this paper are to review governance frameworks and challenges for <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> communities at three critical stages of development: the visioning and planning stage, the implementation stage, and the completion stage. The paper has identified three distinct governance structures <b>of</b> <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> communities – single developer model, principal developer model and government led model. Three case studies from South East Queensland, each being representative of a particular governance structure, are used to evaluate each of the three stages of development with respect to the challenges involved in the provision of infrastructure and services.
