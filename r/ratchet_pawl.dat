With the {{proliferation}} of modern manufacturing methods, such as milling, shaping, broaching, and advanced die forging, it became just as easy to make hex heads and sockets as square ones. The hex form allows easier wrenching in confined surroundings (where nearby obstacles obstruct the swing of the wrench), because fewer degrees of arc are needed on each swing before it is possible to reposition the wrench onto the next set of flats. Ratchet wrenches further reduce this problem, as the wrench need only swing as many degrees as it takes for the <b>ratchet</b> <b>pawl</b> to catch the next tooth.|$|E
50|$|This {{is a type}} of {{maintaining}} power which needs to be engaged before re-winding is started. It consists of a weighted arm (bolt) with a <b>ratchet</b> <b>pawl</b> on the end of it which engages with the edge of the first wheel to keep it turning while the weight or spring is wound. To make sure that it was always operated, the hole in the dial through which the clock is wound is covered with a shutter which can be moved out of the way by pushing down on a lever {{at the side of the}} dial. This lever also engages the bolt. A similar type of mechanism is sometimes used on turret clocks. Because these take much longer to wind, and are usually wound by trained staff, the bolt carries a segment of a gear wheel rather than a single pawl and is engaged manually.|$|E

50|$|If the hub has no {{freewheel}} mechanism {{built into}} it, then a front freewheel is required, which screws onto the crank. These were initially taken from BMX or singlespeed/utility bikes {{and use the}} same threads as screw-on rear hubs. It was found that most BMX freewheels weren't strong enough for trials use {{and for this reason}} trials specific freewheels were designed. Trials freewheels are available with up to 120 clicks per revolution to give excellent drive pickup. Since the torque capacity of the freewheel must be extremely high (Fitted to the crank the freewheel will see the highest torques in the bike drivetrain), instead of making a ratchet with 120 teeth and small <b>ratchet</b> <b>pawls</b> to engage them, the ratchet ring has 40 deep teeth which are less prone to chipping or rounding. These are engaged by 3 <b>ratchet</b> <b>pawls</b> at a time, with 9 in total in the freewheel. Each set of 3 pawls is offset by 1/120 of a revolution from the previous set. This is either achieved by using identical pawls with slight offsets in the machining of the seats for the pawls or by having the pawls in each set of 3 pawls shorter or longer than the other sets of 3.|$|R

50|$|The {{advancement}} of a rotor {{other than the}} left-hand one was called a turnover by the British. This was achieved by a <b>ratchet</b> and <b>pawl</b> mechanism. Each rotor had a ratchet with 26 teeth and every time a key was pressed, the set of spring-loaded pawls moved forward in unison, trying to engage with a ratchet. The alphabet ring of the rotor to the right normally prevented this. As this ring rotated with its rotor, a notch machined into it would eventually align itself with the pawl, allowing it to engage with the ratchet, and advance the rotor on its left. The right-hand pawl, having no rotor and ring to its right, stepped its rotor with every key depression. For a single-notch rotor in the right-hand position, the middle rotor stepped once for every 26 steps of the right-hand rotor. Similarly for rotors two and three. For a two-notch rotor, the rotor to its left would turn over twice for each rotation.|$|R

50|$|The Strowger switch uses two telegraph-type keys on a {{telephone}} set for dialing. Each key requires a separate wire to the exchange. The keys are tapped to step the switch in two stages. The {{first set of}} incoming pulses raises the {{armature of an electromagnet}} to move a shaft which selects the desired level of contacts, by engaging a pawl with the upper <b>ratchet.</b> Another <b>pawl,</b> pivoting on the frame, holds the shaft at that height as it rotates. The second set of pulses, from the second key, operates another electromagnet. Its pawl engages the (hidden) vertical teeth in the lower ratchet to rotate the shaft to the required position. It is kept there against spring tension by a pawl pivoted on the frame. When the switch returns to its home position, typically when a call is complete, a release magnet disengages the pawls that hold the shaft in position. An interlock ensures that the spring on the shaft rotates it to angular home position before it drops to its home position by gravity.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{at first}} sight the Brownian ratchet seems to extract useful work from Brownian motion, Feynman {{demonstrated}} that if the entire device {{is at the same}} temperature, the ratchet will not rotate continuously in one direction but will move randomly back and forth, and therefore will not produce any useful work. The reason is that the pawl, since it is at the same temperature as the paddle, will also undergo Brownian motion, [...] "bouncing" [...] up and down. It therefore will intermittently fail by allowing a ratchet tooth to slip backward under the pawl while it is up. Another issue is that when the pawl rests on the sloping face of the tooth, the spring which returns the pawl exerts a sideways force on the tooth which tends to rotate the ratchet in a backwards direction. Feynman demonstrated that if the temperature [...] of the <b>ratchet</b> and <b>pawl</b> {{is the same as the}} temperature [...] of the paddle, then the failure rate must equal the rate at which the ratchet ratchets forward, so that no net motion results over long enough periods or in an ensemble averaged sense.

50|$|The <b>ratchet</b> and <b>pawl</b> {{was first}} {{discussed}} as a Second Law-violating device by Gabriel Lippmann in 1900. In 1912, Polish physicist Marian Smoluchowski gave the first correct qualitative {{explanation of why}} the device fails; thermal motion of the <b>pawl</b> allows the <b>ratchet's</b> teeth to slip backwards. Feynman did the first quantitative analysis of the device in 1962 using the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, showing that if {{the temperature of the}} paddle T1 was greater than the temperature of the ratchet T2, it would function as a heat engine, but if T1 = T2 there would be no net motion of the paddle. In 1996, Juan Parrondo and Pep Español used a variation of the above device in which no ratchet is present, only two paddles, to show that the axle connecting the paddles and ratchet conducts heat between reservoirs; they argued that although Feynman's conclusion was correct, his analysis was flawed because of his erroneous use of the quasistatic approximation, resulting in incorrect equations for efficiency. Magnasco and Stolovitzky (1998) extended this analysis to consider the full ratchet device, and showed that the power output of the device is far smaller than the Carnot efficiency claimed by Feynman. A paper in 2000 by Derek Abbott, Bruce R. Davis and Juan Parrondo, reanalyzed the problem and extended it to the case of multiple ratchets, showing a link with Parrondo's paradox.|$|R
40|$|Compared with {{conventional}} robots that require {{some sort of}} safety measures in operation, compliant robots capable of interacting with the environment in a gentle way and perform self-adjustment according to the surroundings are of greater need nowadays. To achieve compliance, robots with variable stiffness are highly desirable. Principles of stiffness control for conventional actuators and rigid robots, such as spring-based variable stiffness and impedance mechanisms, have been thoroughly studied. In this thesis, {{the focus is on}} the novel principles of variable stiffness, in particular, on geometry-based and jamming-based methods, and their innovative applications in robotics. The utilization of 3 D printing technology in this research brings new insight into robotic research. At first, a non-assembly design of a compliant pneumatic stepper motor based on the <b>ratchet</b> and <b>pawl</b> mechanism is proposed for robotic drives. The proposed stepper motor can generate rotary stepping motion in response to a train of pulse air pressure. In addition, the pawl is designed as a compliant mechanism instead of conventional rigid component. As a result, the whole mechanism can be fabricated by 3 D printing without any post-assembly or installation of other components. However, the <b>ratchet</b> and <b>pawl</b> mechanism based stepper motor has speed limitation and velocity discontinuity problems. An updated design of non-assembly pneumatic stepper motor allows velocity control, and the switch between continuous motion and stepping motion. The key element to realize the dual motion pattern is an innovative design of a roller valve inspired by the cam-follower mechanism. The roller valve can also modulate the stiffness of robots by air pressure control. The proposed concept of non-assembly robotic design and fabrication based on 3 D printing and the proposed stepper motor designs can bring design innovation to various robots, such as household robots, industrial robots and so on. The geometry-based principle is applicable for compliant robots with rigid parts. For better compliance, jamming technique is applied to a proposed soft robotic spine design. The soft robotic spine is proposed based on the integration of particle jamming and ball joint. The combined mechanism effectively overcomes the unpredictable behavior of jamming due to particle rearrangement and deformation which severely affects its repeatability and stability. The experimental studies have shown stiffness enhancement of 13 times. The compliant spine mechanism can be coupled with an actuation method such as wires/tendons, or soft actuators for robotic applications. The research also finds that the particle jamming technology can bring unexpected effects into biomimetic robotic hand design. The proposed robotic finger design based on the integration of particle jamming and fiber-reinforced soft bending actuator provides an instructive model for robotic gripper applications. The prototype robotic hand demonstrates great performance of reliable grasping. Based on similar jamming interface, a bioinspired robotic palm is designed for the hand. The property of controllable stiffness of the palm allows a full contact of the palm with the object being grasped, thus providing a stable support for object grasping. The proposed palm design demonstrates a close emulation of human palm functions. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Our analysis rests {{on the notion of}} useful flux, which for a thermoelectric system is the electrical current and for Feynman's ratchet is the effective jump frequency. Our approach yields original insight into the derivation and analysis of the system's properties. In particular we define an entropy per tooth in analogy with the entropy per carrier or Seebeck coefficient, and we derive the analogue to Kelvin's second relation for Feynman's ratchet. Owing to the formal similarity between the heat fluxes balance equations for a thermoelectric generator (TEG) and those for Feynman's ratchet, we introduce a distribution parameter that quantifies the amount of heat that flows through the cold and hot sides of both heat engines. While it is well established that γ = 1 / 2 for a TEG, it is equal to 1 for Feynman's ratchet. This implies that no heat may be rejected in the cold reservoir for the latter case. Further, the analysis of the efficiency at maximum power shows that the so-called Feynman efficiency corresponds to that of an exoreversible engine, with γ = 1. Then, turning to the nonlinear regime, we generalize the approach based on the convection picture and introduce two different types of resistance to distinguish the dynamical behavior of the considered system from its ability to dissipate energy. We finally put forth the strong similarity between the original Feynman ratchet and a mesoscopic thermoelectric generator with a single conducting channel...|$|R
