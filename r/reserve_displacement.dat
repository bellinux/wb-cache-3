2500|$|Deng Ai had a {{different}} opinion. He said, [...] "The defeat at {{the west of the}} Tao River wasn't an insignificant loss. The loss of troops and officers, depletion of stores and <b>reserves,</b> and <b>displacement</b> of refugees are signs pointing towards imminent destruction. I shall explain the situation. First, the enemy is riding on a wave of victories, while we're actually weak. Second, the enemy forces are well-trained and battle-ready, while ours are newly recruited and not well-equipped. Third, the enemy is less tired than us because we travel by land while they travel by water. Fourth, the enemy focuses on attacking Didao only, while we spread our defences across four locations – Didao, Longxi (隴西), Nan'an (南安; southeast of present-day Longxi County, Gansu) and Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu). Fifth, Nan'an and Longxi have grain produced by the Qiang people, while there are fields of wheat beyond Mount Qi. The enemy is cunning. They'll definitely come for the wheat." ...|$|R
2500|$|Krylov's planned {{departure}} {{forced the}} NTC to hasten official {{approval of the}} drafts. Their presentation on [...] ended in an embarrassment: the NTC intended to award the contract for one of two new ships to Baltic Shipyard, but did not even inform its master builder Sergey Ratnik about the project's existence. Ratnik, the builder of Alexander III and Suvorov, was confident that the new design was inferior to its predecessors. It had no <b>displacement</b> <b>reserve</b> compared to 246 tonnes of Borodino class and the British standard of at least 4% of standard displacement. The NTC overruled his objections and approved the draft for construction.|$|R
30|$|It is {{expected}} to get higher value of quantitative indexes, e.g., geological <b>reserves</b> abundance, oil <b>displacement</b> efficiency, reserves’ controlled degree of water flooding, reserves producing degree of water flooding, recovery percent ratio, recovery percent of residual recoverable reserves, recovery factor, which are called as positive indexes; it {{is expected}} to get lower value of indexes, e.g., natural decline rate, comprehensive decline rate, water cut increasing rate, operation cost per ton of oil, which are called as negative indexes; it {{is expected to}} get value of a certain range of indexes, e.g., oil recovery rate of geological reserves, oil recovery rate of residual recoverable reserves, the maintenance of formation pressure, injection–production ratio, drawdown pressure, which are called as interval indexes. Above indexes have different dimensions and units, and evenly large difference of numerical order of value. Thus, the evaluation indexes should be normalized before being screened. Only indexes treated with scientific normalization can reflect real and comprehensive evaluation results.|$|R
500|$|In 1915 the Admiralty was {{considering}} {{the next generation}} of warship to follow the Queen Elizabeth-class battleships. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Sir Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt, was given instructions to prepare designs for a new battleship.

40|$|Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights <b>reserved.</b> Forward mandibular <b>displacement</b> {{in animal}} models is {{associated}} with faster and/or redirected condylar growth. Here the effect of forward displacement induced with an intraoral appliance on modelling/remodelling of the mandibular condyle was investigated in eight, 4 -month-old, castrated male Merino sheep, randomly allocated to experimental and control groups (n= 4 in each group). The study period was 15 weeks, during that time, (1) calcein, (2) tetracycline, and (3) alizarin red S fluorochromes were given to all animals from day 1. Midsagittal sections of the temporomandibular joints were selected for analysis. Dynamic variables of bone formation, static indices of bone-forming and -resorbing activity, and structural indices of trabecular bone were estimated histomorphometrically. The sampling site was divided into two regions for analysis: (a) a ‘subchondral region’ (2 and 3 labels only), {{believed to be the}} bone newly formed during the experimental period; (b) a ‘central region’ (labelled by all three fluorochromes), believed to be the bone that existed before the experiment. Regional differences in adaptive response were found. In the experimental group, the bone-volume fraction (BV/TV) of the subchondral regions had decreased, although the specific bone-surface and bone-formation rates had increased. This low BV/TV was associated with decreased trabecular thickness and increased trabecular separation. In the central condylar region of the experimental group, BV/TV was unchanged, but an increased osteoid surface was apparent when the eroded surface was taken into consideration. These adaptive condylar responses to forward mandibular displacement appeared {{to be the result of}} increased osteoblastic activity. Further studies are recommended to examine why the subchondral and central regions responded differently. Bingkui Ma, Wayne Sampsona, David Wilsond, Ole Wiebkine and Nicola Fazzalari[URL]...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{considers}} how proper {{names and}} faces construct, destruct, and reconstruct social identity in A {{tale of two}} cities. Manette’s identification {{at the start of}} the novel, for example, occurs chiefly through a recalled proper name and face. As the French Revolution worked to destroy privileged, individuated identities, so too have contemporary theories of identity, which dismiss individual identity and remain preoccupied with identity at the level of common nouns and generic bodies. However, the near escape of Louis XVI in 1791 highlighted the failure of common noun categorisations and generic bodies to establish social identity. Named and disguised as a valet, Louis was identified by the resemblance of his embodied face to its representation on the money of the period. This picture-identification ushered in a law requiring facial descriptions in passports. Madame Defarge’s knitted register follows pattern of these descriptions. The nearly identical faces of Darnay and Carton, however, thwart her attempts at picture-identification. Where the shared family name and face condemn Darnay by association, physiognomical resemblance to the unrelated Carton saves him. It rescues not only Darnay but also Carton from legal, moral, female, and lower-class condemnation, allowing the French aristocrat to escape public guilt by family, class, and national association and the degraded English middle-class professional to emerge sanitised from his private moral guilt as an international, intergenerational hero. The process operates under a model of simile. Simile, eschewing the metaphoric merger and metonymic <b>displacement</b> <b>reserved</b> for women and the lower classes in the novel, allows each man to exchange his guilt for the other man’s innocence and innocence for the other man’s guilt. It ushers in a perpetual identity theft that allows the individual sins and class crimes of ruling males to pass unaccounted for and be refigured as innocence and heroism...|$|R
