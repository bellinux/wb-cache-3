5|$|There {{are several}} bush {{remedies}} {{used to treat}} jack jumper stings (and any other Myrmecia sting). The young tips of a bracken fern provide a useful bush remedy to treat jack jumper stings, discovered and currently used by indigenous Australians. The tips are rubbed on the stung area, and may relieve the local pain after getting stung. Another plant used as a bush <b>remedy</b> <b>is</b> Carpobrotus glaucescens (known as angular sea-fig or pigface).|$|E
5|$|Assuming for the {{purposes}} of argument, however, that evolution is a religion or religious tenet, the <b>remedy</b> <b>is</b> to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it. Yet it is clearly established in the case law, and perhaps also in common sense, that evolution is not a religion and that teaching evolution does not violate the Establishment Clause, Epperson v. Arkansas, supra, Willoughby v. Stever, No. 15574-75 (D.D.C. May 18, 1973); aff'd. 504 F.2d 271 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cert. denied , 420 U.S. 924 (1975); Wright v. Houston Indep. School Dist., 366 F.

5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits the {{striking}} of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only <b>remedy</b> <b>is</b> automatic reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The race of the defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} what mental element is {{expected}} in cases of trespass to goods; while trespass to the person requires intent, the requirements for trespass to goods have never been tested in court. The common <b>remedy</b> <b>is</b> damages, which may be awarded regardless of if any actual harm is suffered; where there is damage, the defendant will only be liable {{if he could have}} reasonably foreseen it, as in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (No 5). Valid defences are those of statutory authority, consent, where it is necessary to interfere with the goods, or jus tertii.|$|E
5|$|Teo's counsel {{submitted}} {{that the}} nature and conditions of her detention rendered the detention unlawful. The Court of Appeal accepted that detention that was prima facie lawful can become unlawful if the nature or conditions of the detention fall below some minimum standard of treatment, but that extremely inhuman conditions must be shown to exist. In general, where {{the manner in which}} the detention is conducted is alleged to be unlawful, the detainee's <b>remedy</b> <b>is</b> to challenge the validity of the conditions of the detention, not the lawfulness of the detention itself.|$|E

25|$|A common remedy to the Bill of Rights Act 1990 is {{that the}} {{evidence}} obtained through breaching a right is inadmissible in court.

25|$|Tort law in India is a {{relatively}} new common law development supplemented by codifying statutes including statutes governing damages. While India generally follows the UK approach, there are certain differences which may indicate judicial activism, hence creating controversy. Tort is breach of some duty independent of contract which has caused damage to the plaintiff giving rise to civil cause of action and for which <b>remedy</b> <b>is</b> available. If there is no remedy it cannot be called a tort because the essence of tort is to give remedy to the person who has suffered injury.|$|E
25|$|An {{injunction}} is {{a remedy}} having {{the effect of}} preventing the party to whom it is addressed from executing certain ultra vires acts. An injunction that is positive in nature may also be granted to compel performance of a particular act. This <b>remedy</b> <b>is</b> not available in Singapore in relation to public law. The Government Proceedings Act prevents the court from imposing injunctions or ordering specific performance in any proceedings against the Government. However, in place of such relief, the court may make an order declaratory of the rights between parties.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court {{is also a}} Court of Equity vested with powers, authority, and {{jurisdiction}} to administer justice and to do all acts for the due execution of such equitable jurisdiction, in all cases where no legal <b>remedy</b> <b>is</b> provided by any enactment.

25|$|Article 2(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights {{requires}} {{parties to}} the treaty to ensure that any person whose rights and freedoms have been breached to have an effective remedy. It is often argued by New Zealand academics {{that the lack of}} express remedies in the Bill of Rights Act does not meet this requirement. One such express <b>remedy</b> <b>is</b> a judicial power to strike down legislation that is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights Act 1990. This is similar to the powers of the Court under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E
25|$|British writer Arthur C. Benson felt shyness is {{not mere}} self-consciousness, but a {{primitive}} suspicion of strangers, the primeval belief that their motives are predatory, with shyness a sinister quality which {{needs to be}} uprooted. He believed the <b>remedy</b> <b>is</b> for the shy to frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed that too many shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for the shy to be nice, to wonder what others need and like, interest in what others do or are talking about, friendly questions, and sympathy.|$|E
25|$|A third {{example is}} the {{determination}} of the salary for work performed. Whether we reckon using the Stelo system or not, wages are a matter of daily concern. All industrialized countries must contend with inflation, which continuously gnaws away at the family budget, and the only <b>remedy</b> <b>is</b> the continuing increase of salaries. Especially in the industrialized world, wage negotiations can lead to sometimes bitter confrontation between employers and labour unions. In developing countries lacking a strong tradition of labour relations law, these confrontations can result in human rights abuses or even in police or military intervention. After a strike or lockout has concluded it may {{take a long time to}} regain an atmosphere of mutual confidence and trust. Esperantist economists believe that the application of the Stelo to labour-management negotiations could prevent these problems.|$|E
