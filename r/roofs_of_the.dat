5|$|In 2008, the Utzon Center, its art, {{architecture}} and design credited to the noted architect Jørn Utzon, is also dedicated to him. It was built {{next to the}} Limfjord at the central harbour front in Aalborg. Born in Copenhagen, Utzon grew up in Aalborg. The centre contains an exhibition on Utzon's work, which includes the Sydney Opera House, as well as educational displays on {{architecture and}} design. The centre consists of several individual buildings creating a special place around a courtyard on a platform. The tall sculptural <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auditorium and the boat-hall, both on the harbour front, and the library facing the park area and the city are set off by the lower <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exhibition and workshop areas inside the complex.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} May 5, 1931, under Brother Theophorus Kleemann, SVD, who became ill and died on September 12, 1931; Arthur Bialucha, a German {{architect}} living in Qingdao {{who had already}} completed several projects for the SVD, took over as construction superintendent. Construction was frustrated in 1933, when Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} Germany and prohibited the transfer of money overseas. The diocese independently shouldered the cost of finishing the cathedral. This required a number of design changes to reduce costs. The changes are evident in drawings published before completion of construction, which show the <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towers as bell-shaped. However, the <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> completed structure were changed to spires. Construction was finished in 1934, and the cathedral was consecrated on October 28 that year.|$|E
5|$|Princes Margret Hospital, the island's only hospital, {{suffered}} {{damage to the}} <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> psychiatric and intensive care units. This led to heavy water damage, which also spread into the maternity ward and damaged the electrical system. All of the patients had been evacuated before the storm arrived. Because most equipment and supplies had also been removed, the hurricane's cost to the health sector {{was limited to the}} EC$3million of structural damage.|$|E

5|$|The St Vincent {{class was}} {{equipped}} with ten breech-loading (BL) 12-inch (305mm) Mk XI guns in five twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets. The secondary, or anti-torpedo boat, armament comprised twenty BL 4-inch (102mm) Mk VII guns. Two of these guns were each installed on the <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fore and aft centreline turrets and the wing turrets in unshielded mounts, and the other ten were positioned in the superstructure. All guns were in single mounts. The ships were also fitted with three 18-inch (450mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and the third in the stern.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{approach to}} the house {{would have been far}} more impressive than the picturesque approach today. The east front was then the entrance façade and faced onto a large entrance court. The two remaining pavilions flanked a large gatehouse; this long-demolished structure contained secondary lodgings. In turn, the entrance court and gatehouse were approached through a larger outer court. The courts were however not fortified, but bordered by ornate balustrading, which with the ogee <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pavilions, which in reality were follies, were a purely ornamental and domestic acknowledgement of the fortified courts and approaches found in earlier medieval English manors and castles.|$|E
5|$|Constructing a warship of {{the size}} of the Mary Rose was a major undertaking, {{requiring}} vast quantities of high-quality material. In the case of building a state-of-the-art warship, these materials were primarily oak. The total amount of timber needed for the construction can only be roughly calculated since only about one third of the ship still exists. One estimate for the number of trees is around 600 mostly large oaks, representing about 16 hectares (40 acres) of woodland. The huge trees that had been common in Europe and the British Isles in previous centuries were by the 16th century quite rare, which meant that timbers were brought in from all over southern England. The largest timbers used in the construction were of roughly the same size as those used in the <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest cathedrals in the high Middle Ages. An unworked hull plank would have weighed over 300kg (660lb), and one of the main deck beams would have weighed close to three-quarters of a tonne.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the relationship between <b>the</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glenoid fossa in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and the existence and types of condylar bone change. Material and methods: Helical CT was used to measure <b>the</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glenoid fossa at its thinnest part in 37 orthodontic patients with temporomandibular disorders. Condylar bone changes were classified into four types: no bone change (24 joints); flattening (19 joints); osteophyte formation (13 joints); and erosion (18 joints). Results: <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glenoid fossa was significantly thicker in joints with bone change than in joints with no bone change (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0. 05). There was also a significant difference in relation to <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> condylar bone change: <b>the</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glenoid fossa in the erosion group was significantly greater than in the no bone change (P < 0. 01), flattening (P < 0. 05) and osteophyte formation (P < 0. 05) groups (Kruskal-Wallis and Games-Howell tests). Conclusion: Compensative bone formation in <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glenoid fossa might help to withstand the increased stress in the TMJ accompanying condylar bone change, especially erosion.

5|$|The Chapel of St Michael and All Angels and the Lady Chapel are at {{the east}} end of the outer north and south aisles respectively, and contain 20 of the 28 stone heads carved by Thomas Earp of Lambeth in 1878–1880, mostly {{depicting}} biblical characters such as Salome and John the Baptist, or historical figures like St Helen and Martin Luther. Ten are paired {{on opposite sides of the}} five pillars defining the inner edge of the Lady Chapel aisle, and another ten are similarly arranged in the Chapel of St Michael and All Angels. The corbels of the north, west and south doors bear six more heads, those by the west door depicting Queen Victoria and Archbishop Tait; and Jesus and Moses are higher on the corbels of the west window. The clerestory and the wooden <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave and south inner aisle are 15th century, but the rest of the lead-clad roofing dates from the Victorian rebuilding.|$|E
5|$|The multi-coloured {{platform}} tiles on the Northern line were reconstructed in the 1920s {{in conjunction}} with an extension to Morden station. The tiles were carefully replicated in 2006 to replace the originals, which were in poor condition. The original C tiles dating from 1890 remain on the tunnel <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern line platforms, albeit now covered over by the new cable-management system. The station was refurbished in 2007. The original maroon and cream tiling on the Bakerloo line platforms has been covered over. Because of {{the arrangement of the}} lighting, cabling and public address loudspeakers, {{it was not possible to}} arrange the new roundels at alternate ‘low’ and ‘high’ positions, all being at the lower level.|$|E
5|$|Spirit Splash occurs the Friday {{before the}} Homecoming game, {{and serves as}} a pep rally where {{students}} descend into the pond to demonstrate school spirit. Spirit Splash began in 1995 when then-Student Body President Miguel Torregrossa was pushed into the Reflecting Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students followed suit. Along with the thousands of students who attend, there are members of the community, local dignitaries, alumni, children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities. Knightro, the Marching Knights, cheerleaders, student athletes, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert. Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon's visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement. It was determined {{that the best way to}} protect the president would be to hold commencement in the pond itself, after being drained, so that Secret Service agents could be stationed on the <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adjacent buildings.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn working Gaolin in <b>the</b> Suoli Mine <b>of</b> Huaibei Area, <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> strata <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gob {{approaches}} the working face {{to a great}} extent, offering difficulties for ventilation and pedestrian. To solve the problem, experiments are carried out by <b>the</b> haulage way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> working face by drilling upward a series <b>of</b> holes in <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall to be worked for deephole pre-cracking blasting so that a cracked surface is formed between <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> haulage way and <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> working area. In this way, the problem is solved which is attributable to the great approaching movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock strata in the <b>roof</b> and <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gob. Careful observation shows that with the blasting carried out, the presupporting resistance and <b>the</b> approaching movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock strata <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> haulage way are not significantly varied. And in the area behind the working face, the rock strata approaching movement is apparently reduced...|$|R

5|$|The {{crew of the}} Sevastopol {{joined the}} Kronstadt Rebellion of March 1921. She {{returned}} fire when the Bolsheviks began to bombard Kronstadt Island and was hit by three 12-inch shells that killed or wounded 102 sailors. After the rebellion was bloodily crushed, she was renamed Parizhskaya Kommuna after the Paris Commune on 31 March 1921. She was refitted several times before she was recommissioned on 17 September 1925. She was refitted again in 1928 at the Baltic Shipyard, in preparation for her transfer to the Black Sea Fleet. Her forward funnel was raised and the upper part was angled aft {{in an attempt to}} keep the exhaust gases out of the control and gunnery spaces, while three 3-inch 'Lender' AA guns were added to the <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fore and aft turrets. She received some additional rangefinders and she was given a false bow to improve her sea-keeping ability. She sailed for the Black Sea on 22 November 1929, in company of the cruiser Profintern, encountering a bad storm in the Bay of Biscay. The open-topped bow lacked enough drainage and tended to trap a lot of water which badly damaged both the false bow and the supporting structure. Parizhskaya Kommuna was forced to put into Brest for repairs, which included the removal of the bulwark that retained so much water. Both ships arrived at Sevastopol on 18 January 1930 and Parizhskaya Kommuna became the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} were {{filmed in}} two specially converted aircraft hangars near Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk, which were leased for £1,500; this cost-measure resulted {{in much of}} the dialogue having to be re-recorded later, because the tin <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hangars caused an echo. The exterior shots range from the Dunwich Coast (for the scene with the fisherman) to Langley Park outside London (for the scene where Stearne escapes capture). The tracking shot of the ambush after the opening credits was filmed at Black Park in southeast Buckinghamshire, a location frequently used by Hammer Film Productions. Lavenham Square (in Lavenham, Suffolk), site of the witch-burning scene, was the real Lavenham Market Square; the crew lowered TV antennas and telephone wires and Waddilove hired a cherry picker from a local utility company for £10, because the unit couldn't afford a camera crane. The countryside vistas seen in the chase scenes on horseback were shot on the Stanford Battle Area near Thetford, Norfolk— the producer, through connections with the government, was able to lease parts of the area. The church used in the film is St John The Evangelist in Rushford in Norfolk. The moat drowning and hanging scenes were filmed at Kentwell Hall, in Long Melford. The climax of the film was shot at Orford Castle, on the coast of East Anglia, which is an English Heritage property. Filming wrapped as scheduled on 13 November 1967.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} ice houses made it {{difficult}} to load ice into them; in 1827 Wyeth invented a lever and horse-drawn pulley system to raise blocks of ice through the <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warehouses. Later improvements to loading included the use of lift systems to raise the blocks of ice {{to the top of the}} building, first using horse power, then steam power; the largest warehouses later introduced conveyor belt systems to bring the ice into storage. Power houses containing the equipment to support these were built alongside the ice houses, and care was taken to avoid the risk of fire from this machinery. Warehouses were typically painted either white or yellow in order to reflect the sun during the summer. A typical Hudson River warehouse might be 400 feet (120 m) long, 100 feet (30 m) deep and three stories high, able to hold 50,000 tons (four million kg) of ice. The later railroad ice houses could hold up to 250,000 tons (220 million kg) apiece.|$|E
