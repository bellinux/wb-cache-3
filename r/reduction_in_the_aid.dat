40|$|Today 2 ̆ 7 s {{hearing aids}} have many shortcomings: they are {{susceptible}} to environmental damage, cannot be worn while sleeping or in wet environments, are obtrusive and are expensive. New technologies are being developed which allow most all of these shortcomings {{to be addressed by}} placing a portion of <b>the</b> hearing <b>aid</b> within <b>the</b> middle ear. These new technologies require size <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> several of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> components, one of these being the microphone. Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) has already developed technologies {{that can be used to}} construct these microphones. Most microphones constructed using MEMS techniques employ a dual wafer design. the microphone membrane is constructed on one wafer and attached to a second wafer containing bonding pads and possibly additional sensing elements. The use of two wafers to manufacture one microphone reduces the yield of the process and requires an additional alignment and bonding step. Further, the methods used for fabrication are non-traditional and do not allow appropriate electronics to be easily fabricated with the microphone. An alternative approach is being investigated by this thesis. Here a single wafer and standard microelectronic processing techniques are used to fabricate the diaphragm, sensing elements and bonding pads. This approach will simplify construc tion and allow the possibility of including appropriate signal processing electronics on the microphone die. Equations are developed to predict the static and dynamic deflec tion and natural frequency of the microphone system. Optimal design strategies are used to minimize the microphone diaphragm area subject to electrical and mechanical constraints. A first generation microphone was fabricated. However, unanticipated processing constraints on the microphone design rendered the microphones inoperable. Several design modifications are noted to solve these problems and promote the successful fabrication of second generation microphones...|$|R
40|$|In {{every day}} life conversations and {{listening}} scenarios the desired speech signal is rarely delivered alone. The listener most commonly faces a scenario {{where he has}} to understand speech in a noisy environment. Hearing impairments, and more particularly sensorineural losses, can cause a reduction of speech understanding in noise. Therefore, in a hearing aid compensating for such kind of losses it {{is not sufficient to}} just amplify the incoming sound. Hearing aids also need to integrate algorithms that allow to discriminate between speech and noise in order to extract a desired speech from a noisy environment. A standard noise <b>reduction</b> scheme <b>in</b> general aims at maximising the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal to be fed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hearing <b>aid</b> loudspeaker. This signal, however, does not reach the eardrum directly. It first has to propagate through an acoustic path and encounter some perturbations which are, by design, neglected <b>in</b> standard noise <b>reduction</b> schemes. <b>In</b> an open fitting setup, there is no earmold to prevent ambient sound from reaching the eardrum or to prevent the sound amplified by <b>the</b> hearing <b>aid</b> from leaving <b>the</b> ear canal. This signal leakage through the open fitting combined with <b>the</b> attenuation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> acoustic path between <b>the</b> hearing <b>aid</b> loudspeaker and <b>the</b> eardrum, i. e., the so-called secondary path, can then override the action of <b>the</b> noise <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hearing <b>aid.</b> Active noise control can be used to compensate for the effects of this signal leakage. The principle of active noise control is to generate a zone of quiet based on destructive interference, in this case at <b>the</b> eardrum. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> hearing <b>aids</b> framework, however, active noise control alone is not sufficient. It has to be performed together with the noise reduction algorithm. This thesis first presents an integrated active noise control and noise reduction scheme for hearing aids to tackle secondary path effects and effects of noise leakage through an open fitting. Integrating active noise control and noise <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> a single set of filters allows to compensate for the signal leakage and the secondary path effects. The implementation of the integrated active noise control and noise <b>reduction</b> scheme <b>in</b> hearing aids, however, comes with a number of problems primarily due to the dimensions of the devices. Firstly, the integrated active noise control and noise reduction scheme does not allow to balance between the noise reduction and the active noise control. In some circumstances {{it would be useful to}} emphasise one of the functional blocks. Secondly, the integrated active noise control and noise reduction scheme relies on an ear canal microphone which should ideally be located at <b>the</b> eardrum. <b>In</b> practice, however, <b>the</b> ear canal microphone is distant from the eardrum and the sound reaching the eardrum is basically unknown and uncontrolled. Finally, the use of active noise control in hearing aids, is limited by the size of the devices and the number of microphones available on each device. The number of noise sources that can be compensated for by the active noise control is limited by the number of microphones available. Also the small separation between the microphones and <b>the</b> loudspeaker results <b>in</b> a short acoustic propagation time and hence small causality margins. In order to solve these problems, variations on the integrated active noise control and noise reduction scheme are also presented in this thesis. Firstly, changing the original problem to a constrained problem leads to weighted integrated active noise control and noise reduction schemes. A first weighted integrated active noise control and noise reduction scheme is derived that allows to emphasise either the active noise control (providing an improved signal-to-noise ratio) or the noise reduction (providing a lower speech distortion). A speech intelligibility weighted integrated active noise control and noise reduction scheme is then derived that allows to focus on reducing speech distortion at the eardrum or on minimising the residual noise at the eardrum. Secondly, an integrated approach to active noise control and noise reduction that is based on an optimisation over a zone of quiet generated by the active noise control is then proposed. This approach allows to overcome the ear canal microphone location problem. Finally, a binaural approach is introduced that allows to access extra microphones from <b>the</b> contra-lateral hearing <b>aid</b> and to design a scheme with increased causality margin. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} resource positions of <b>the</b> developing counties <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Asia Pacific {{region and the}} support they are receiving from donor countries are adequate {{to ensure that the}} MDG will be attained by 2015. It begins by examining the extant record of economic growth and emphasises the need for higher economic growth in order to accelerate the pace of poverty reduction. It argues that neither the level of economic growth nor its current structure can ensure that MDG 1 is attained by 2015. The paper argues that domestic savings and investment rates in most large developing countries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Asia Pacific region are not high enough for growth rates to rise high enough to ensure that MDG 1 (halving poverty measured at $ 1 PPP per capita over the period 1990 - 2015) is attained. Further, <b>the</b> ICOR <b>in</b> most of these countries has been stagnant or rising in many of these countries so that it would be unrealistic to expect sharp enough rises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> productivity of capital to ensure that existing investment rates can ensure that MDG 1 is attained by 2015. The paper then examines some of the reasons for this lacklustre performance. Tax revenues have been stagnant and public expenditures on education and health have been low whereas many developing countries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Asia Pacific region bear substantial burdens of debt servicing. Many of these countries also face considerable capital flight, exacerbating already tentative external situations. Furthermore whereas the current outlook for FDI looks promising for some Asian countries, international aid has been stagnant and in, many cases, net financial flows into developing countries has been negative. The paper then considers avenues for increasing the resource base for these counties. It considers a variety of measures including tax reform and expenditure switching policies. It advances policies to reduce capital flight and argues that international debt reduction should accompany any policy to increase international <b>aid</b> to <b>the</b> developing countries of the Asia Pacific region. It lists a number of additional sources of multilateral aid that could replenish developing country resources but argues that measures to increase the absorptive capacity of developing countries as well as <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> volatility of <b>aid</b> must accompany to increase international aid. Further, increases in international aid should ensure that the real exchange rates of the recipient countries should not rise. If the real exchange rates were to rise, some of these countries could be exposed to Dutch disease type of phenomena.

Law students acting as Community Legal Companions assist self-represented litigants with legal form-filling; bundle preparation; signposting to appropriate legal and third sector services and accompany litigants in person to hearings along McKenzie Friend principles by taking notes for them. Drawing on {{the experiences of the}} scheme at two of the participating universities: Canterbury Christ Church University and the University of Brighton, Ben Waters and Jeanette Ashton outline the role of the Community Legal Companion and how <b>the</b> scheme operates <b>in</b> their respective court centres. They share their experiences of setting up the scheme and of their students’ reflections on volunteering as Community Legal Companions. Situated within a pedagogical context of experiential learning and clinical legal education, the paper also reflects upon the project based research undertaken at both institutions. This includes the responses provided by the students to an initial questionnaire about their experiences as they embarked upon their Companionship role, and the responses received to a follow-up questionnaire after students had undertaken the role for the three-month period. When presenting the research findings, consideration is given to students’ perceptions of the Community Legal Companion role; their motivations for volunteering for the scheme; the preparation and training they received from academic leads, legal partners, third sector partners and the courts; the challenges presented by the role; the supportive link made to their academic studies and the opportunities for key skills acquisition. Perceptions of employability enhancement and the likely impact of <b>the</b> role <b>in</b> supporting students’ future careers are also considered. Whilst there is a considerable body of literature on the well-known and perhaps more established clinical legal education model i. e. that of the university-based law clinic, this paper contributes to the research from the perspective of experiential learning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of the court environment through situated learning opportunities. It is argued that such socio-legal active learning initiatives enable law students to learn about law in context, in this case by assisting self-represented litigants who are often at their most vulnerable, with some having poor levels of literacy and many being thoroughly bewildered by the court process. The findings of the study reveal that the CLOCK Community Legal Companion scheme, as well as bringing benefits to the wider community, enables law student volunteers to develop key skills, build links with legal and third sector partners and to feel part of a community of practice...|$|R

The three core results to emerge from the model are that allocative e¢ciency improves under performance intensity of <b>aid,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sense that more aid comes to be allocated to aid recipients with good governance.
