25|$|Lady Isle {{is home to}} an {{interesting}} lighthouse. Established in 1903 the lighthouse is not the standard round tower type but rather consists of a platform built on buttresses with an exterior stairwell. The light is still used as a navigational aid (Fl(4)30s19m8M) and is managed by the Northern Lighthouse Board. An X/S Band racon <b>radar</b> <b>beacon,</b> with S Band emissions restricted to landward {{is also on the}} lighthouse. A small wooden storage hut sits beside the lighthouse, rather oddly inscribed Social Security Appeals Tribunal. A large white horizontal cylinder used to hold the gas supply for the lighthouse light which was converted to electricity during the refurbishment and solarisation in around 2004. Regarding the approach to the island, mariners have to beware the drying rock all around the island up to 2 cables to the northeast (see the map).|$|E
500|$|At {{a meeting}} on 30 December 1940, {{it was decided to}} begin limited {{production}} of the new indicators as an add-on unit for existing Mk. IV systems, creating the AI Mk. IVA. The first examples arrived in January 1941, with more units from ADEE and Dynatron following in early February. Hanbury Brown's involvement with AI came to an abrupt end during testing of the new unit. During a flight in February 1941 at [...] his oxygen supply failed and he suddenly awoke in an ambulance on the ground. He was no longer allowed to fly on tests, and moved to working on <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> systems.|$|E

50|$|The {{low clouds}} and {{extremely}} intense anti-aircraft fire caused the pathfinder sticks {{to be dropped}} off course, with only one stick landing in the correct place (Ambrose, p. 196). Their <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> did work somewhat effectively; even though the pathfinders set up their equipment off course, many of the sticks of follow up paratroopers landed clustered near these beacons.|$|R
50|$|Buoys {{serviced}} by the Papaw ranged from tiny 6 ft nun buoys to the 35 ft tall 18,000 lb Galveston Entrance Channel Buoy. Most buoys {{are equipped with}} electrical lights powered by batteries and solar cells. Some have sound signals, <b>radar</b> <b>beacons,</b> and elaborate power systems. All buoys are pulled from the water {{at least once a}} year for painting, maintenance, and position checks.|$|R

5000|$|AN/MPN-2 was {{a mobile}} <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> which {{provided}} navigational aid and homing facilities for aircraft. Its major components, AN/CPN-6, and AN/CPN-8, were mounted {{in a trailer}} van.|$|E
50|$|Their {{characteristics}} are {{defined in the}} ITU-R Recommendation M.824, Technical Parameters of <b>Radar</b> <b>Beacons</b> (RACONS). Racons usually operate on the 9320 MHz to 9500 MHz marine radar band (X-band), and most also operate on the 2920 MHz to 3100 MHz marine radar band (S-band). Modern racons are frequency-agile; they have a wide-band receiver that detects the incoming radar pulse, tunes the transmitter and responds with a 25 microsecond long signal within 700 nanoseconds.|$|R
5000|$|Underwater {{demolition}} teams (UDT) {{approached the}} beach in small craft to reconnoiter the landing beaches and to plant <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> which would provide reference points to the next day's landing. Tennessee closed to 3,000 yd of Agingan Point and opened up with 14 in, 5 inand [...] batteries. Some smoldering powder grains from the 5 in guns fell {{on the port side}} of the battleship's quarterdeck and burst into flame, but were quickly extinguished.|$|R
50|$|Easton {{was born}} in Craftsbury, Vermont, to Dr. Frank B. Easton, a physician, and Della Donnocker, a school teacher. He {{graduated}} from Middlebury College in 1943. He also attended the University of Michigan for 1 semester before joining the Naval Research Laboratory in 1943. At the Naval Research Laboratory {{he worked in the}} Radio Division on <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> and blind-landing systems. Easton also worked in the laboratory's Rocket-Sonde Branch which was dealing with space related research.|$|R

50|$|In 1963, {{in order}} to help nearby Hualien Harbor become an {{international}} port, a new lighthouse, consisting of a white pentagon concrete building, was built on the original lighthouse base. The newly built Qilaibi Lighthouse used a 4th class white light electric lamp, the light flashing 3 seconds and dimming 3 seconds at a regular 6 second intervals, and the luminous intensity is 28,000 cd. In 1973, a non-directional beacon pole was added, with output power 100 watts and range 100 nms, to function in coordination with the Lyudao Lighthouse, also a non-directional beacon pole, for the ships mutual positioning. In 1985, a <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> pole was set. Then finally, in 1992, the communication systems were comprehensively changed into a dual-frequency <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> pole.|$|E
50|$|Melpar linked {{production}} facilities to its scientific and engineering capabilities. The company won two large contracts for B-58 aircraft electronics and Minuteman missile guidance components, requiring {{a buildup of}} manufacturing plants and an associated technical work force in the Washington area. These facilities enabled scientists to test their laboratory research with prototype hardware. By 1960 the company assembled products such as missile equipment, flight simulators, <b>radar</b> <b>beacons,</b> fuses, data processing equipment, communications, antennas, electronic countermeasure and reconnaissance systems.|$|R
50|$|The International Maritime Organization's International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea {{requires}} the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to be fitted aboard international voyaging ships with , and all passenger ships regardless of size. Although AIS transmitters/receivers are generally called transponders they generally transmit autonomously, although coast stations can interrogate class B transponders on smaller vessels for additional information. In addition, navigational aids often have transponders called RACON (<b>radar</b> <b>beacons)</b> {{designed to make}} them stand out on a ship's radar screen.|$|R
50|$|Problematically, {{there were}} IFF {{incompatibilities}} {{that threatened to}} label friendly aircraft as foe for want of an IFF signal showing otherwise. The risk of mis-identification of targets and consequent friendly fire casualties rose significantly. Until the squadron was completely re-equipped with new aircraft using only centimetric radar, {{it was necessary to}} ensure that all fighter aircraft in the air at any one time had either VHF or S-Band equipment - never a mixture. The S-Band equipped Beaufighters were unable {{to make use of the}} VHF <b>Radar</b> <b>Beacons.</b> The changeover was not completed until August 1943, just prior to the squadron's departure to Sicily.|$|R
50|$|The 3rd Order optic was {{replaced}} by a rotating beacon, which possessed a revolving array of 24 lamps-cum-reflectors. An ‘S’ and ‘X’ band <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> was also installed in 1984 which provides additional navigational information to ships by emitting a morse code on the ship’s radar screen.|$|E

25|$|One {{of several}} methods the IRA used to counter British body armour {{was the use}} of high {{velocity}} Barrett Light 50 and Belgian FN sniper rifles, several of which the Provisionals imported from the USA. Two snipers teams of the South Armagh Brigade killed nine members of the security forces in this way. To avoid the jamming of wireless-triggered detonators, the organisation began to employ <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> to prime their explosive devices, improving dramatically the effectiveness of the attacks. By 1992, the use of long-range weapons like mortars and heavy machine guns by the IRA had forced the British Army to build its checkpoints one to five miles from the border in order to avoid attacks launched from the Republic.|$|R
5000|$|To obtain {{reliability}} {{in providing}} accurate trajectory data, the Mercury spacecraft {{was equipped with}} C-band and S-band cooperative <b>beacons.</b> The ground <b>radar</b> systems had to be compatible with the spacecraft <b>radar</b> <b>beacons.</b> The FPS-16 <b>radar</b> in use at most national missile ranges was selected to meet the C-band requirement. Although it originally had a range capability of only 250 nmi km, most of the FPS-16 radar units selected for the project had been modified for operation up to 500 nmi km, a NASA requirement, and modification kits were obtained for the remaining systems. In addition to the basic radar system, it was also necessary to provide the required data-handling equipment to allow {{data to be transmitted}} from all sites to the computers.|$|R
50|$|SHORAN is {{an acronym}} for SHOrt RAnge Navigation, a type of {{electronic}} navigation and bombing system using a precision <b>radar</b> <b>beacon.</b> It was developed during World War II and the first stations were being set up in Europe when the war ended. It saw its first combat use in the B-26 and B-29 bomber aircraft during the Korean War.|$|E
50|$|The {{air traffic}} control <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> system (ATCRBS) is a system used in {{air traffic control}} (ATC) to enhance {{surveillance}} radar monitoring and separation of air traffic. ATCRBS assists ATC surveillance radars by acquiring information about the aircraft being monitored, and providing this information to the radar controllers. The controllers can use the information to identify radar returns from aircraft (known as targets) and to distinguish those returns from ground clutter.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} towers at the site. The tallest {{one is a}} 55-metre high {{civilian}} telecommunication tower, owned by Télédiffusion de France. The telecommunication tower is topped by a radome and contains a mode S air traffic control <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> system owned by the Directorate General for Civil Aviation. The radar has been in operation since 18 August 2009 but has experienced malfunctions due to heavy snowfall in the area.|$|E
25|$|The main combat jumps were preceded at each {{drop zone}} by three teams of pathfinders that arrived thirty {{minutes before the}} main assault to set up {{navigation}} aids, including Eureka <b>radar</b> transponder <b>beacons</b> and marker lights, to aid the C-47s in locating the DZs in the dark.|$|R
500|$|The British Tizard Mission to the United States in 1940 {{demonstrated}} to leading American scientists the successful {{application of the}} cavity magnetron to produce short wavelength pulsed radar. The National Defense Research Committee, established only months earlier by President Franklin Roosevelt, created a central national laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) {{for the purpose of}} developing military applications of microwave radar. Lawrence immediately recruited his best [...] "cyclotroneers", among them Alvarez, who joined this new laboratory, known as the Radiation Laboratory, on November 11, 1940. Alvarez contributed to a number of radar projects, from early improvements to Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) <b>radar</b> <b>beacons,</b> now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars.|$|R
5000|$|Radio {{direction}} finding, Radio direction finder, or RDF {{was once}} the primary aviation navigational aid. (Range and Direction Finding was the abbreviation {{used to describe the}} predecessor to <b>Radar.)</b> <b>Beacons</b> were used to mark [...] "airways" [...] intersections and to define departure and approach procedures. Since the signal transmitted contains no information about bearing or distance, these beacons are referred to as non-directional beacons, or NDB in the aviation world. Starting in the 1950s, these beacons were generally replaced by the VOR system, in which the bearing to the navigational aid is measured from the signal itself; therefore no specialized antenna with moving parts is required. Due to relatively low purchase, maintenance and calibration cost, NDB's are still used to mark locations of smaller aerodromes and important helicopter landing sites.|$|R
5000|$|The present {{lighthouse}} equipment {{consists of}} a main and standby rotating beacon, each producing 117,000 candelas with a nominal range of [...] A <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> (racon) was also installed at the lighthouse which provides additional navigational information to ships by emitting a Morse code on the ship's radar screen. In 2005, an Aids to Navigation Automatic Identification System (AIS) was installed to broadcast additional positioning information to ships.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>beacon</b> (short: racon) is - {{according}} to article 1.103 of the International Telecommunication Union´s (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) - defined as [...] "A transmitter-receiver {{associated with a}} fixed navigational mark which, when triggered by a radar, automatically returns a distinctive signal which can appear on the display of the triggering radar, providing range, bearing and identification information." [...] Each station (transmitter-receiver, radar) shall be classified by the service in which it operates permanently or temporarily.|$|E
50|$|Radar {{made its}} {{appearance}} during World War II, primarily {{in its early}} warning capability. In {{the early days of}} the Cold War, Soviet troops would use a directional <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> to lure surveillance aircraft toward their airspace in order to shoot them down. By this time radar scopes became available in larger aircraft monitoring Soviet-controlled border areas. Having these scopes made early radar navigation possible, indeed, in photos released by the Soviet air force, pictures were taken of the screens, documenting this use.|$|E
50|$|The AN/UPN-1 was a <b>radar</b> Pathfinder radio <b>beacon</b> {{used by the}} United States Army Air Forces and Airborne forces during World War II.|$|R
30|$|Radars {{have been}} used {{for a long time to}} {{estimate}} movements, for example in the early experiments by Clark and Durrant-Whyte [20]. <b>Radar</b> reflecting <b>beacons</b> in known positions were tracked using a millimeter radar, and this was shown to improve the movement estimates. Shortly after, Clark and Dissanayake [21] extended the work by tracking natural features instead of beacons.|$|R
