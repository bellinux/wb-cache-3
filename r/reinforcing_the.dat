5|$|A {{disaster}} {{struck the}} colony on 13 August 2010, when a forest fire {{swept through the}} breeding site killing three adults and 25 of the 38 chicks. The fire destroyed the vegetation and several nesting burrows. Conservation action to protect the 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds and burnt vegetation, <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> surviving nests, and setting poison bait for rats around the now exposed nest sites. In the longer term, the action plan includes the provision of artificial burrows, seed dispersal to help the vegetation recover, {{and the use of}} anti-erosion materials.|$|E

John seized the castle as well during his revolt in 1191, and although he was forced to return it, he reclaimed it when he became king himself in 1199. John made extensive use of Wallingford Castle during the First Barons' War between 1215 and 1216, <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> fortifications and mobilising a substantial garrison to protect it.|$|E
5|$|From the northeast, the 2nd SS Panzer Division planned {{an assault}} in force against the four {{infantry}} battalions and two armoured regiments of the Polish 1st Armoured Division dug in on Hill 262. The 9th SS Panzer Division would {{attack from the}} north, while simultaneously preventing Canadian units from <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> Polish armoured division. Having managed {{to break out of}} the Falaise Pocket, the 10th SS, 12th SS and 116th Panzer Divisions would then attack Hill262 from the southwest. If this major obstacle could be cleared, German units could initiate a full withdrawal from the Falaise Pocket.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the design of the first castle at Rochester as it has since vanished, and even the exact site is uncertain. It most likely took the form of a motte-and-bailey castle, with a mound and an outer {{enclosure}} defended by a timber palisade and earthen banks. Boley Hill has been suggested as the site of the first castle, an outwork <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> castle's defences, or an abandoned siege castle like those documented in the 1088 siege. Boley Hill is a natural outcrop of rock, and could have acted as a motte.|$|E
5|$|The Allied plan to aid Belgium was the Dyle Plan; {{the cream}} of the Allied forces, which {{included}} the French armoured divisions, would advance to the Dyle river in response to a German invasion. The choice of an established Allied line lay in either <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> Belgians in the east of the country, at the Meuse–Albert Canal line, and holding the Scheldt Estuary, thus linking the French defences in the south with the Belgian forces protecting Ghent and Antwerp, seemed to be the soundest defensive strategy.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Arawe (also {{known as}} Operation Director) was fought between Allied and Japanese forces during the New Britain Campaign of World War II. The battle formed {{part of the}} Allied Operation Cartwheel, and had the {{objective}} of serving as a diversion before a larger landing at Cape Gloucester in late December 1943. The Japanese military was expecting an Allied offensive in western New Britain, and was <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> region {{at the time of}} the Allied landing in the Arawe area on 15December 1943. The Allies secured Arawe after about a month of intermittent fighting with the outnumbered Japanese force.|$|E

5|$|The Crusades {{consolidated}} {{the papal}} {{leadership of the}} Latin Church, <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> link between Western Christendom, feudalism, and militarism and increased the tolerance of the clergy to violence.

The Crusades also had a role in the creation and institutionalisation of the military and the Dominican orders as well as the Medieval Inquisition.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{bought an}} example of, and plans for, the {{machinery}} of the later Duca d'Aosta-class cruisers and had some difficulty in adapting the smaller hull for the larger and more-powerful machinery, {{so much so that}} it delayed the start of construction. Another problem was that the Italian design had to be adapted to use the Soviet preference for a mix of longitudinal framing for the hull framing amidships and transverse framing for the ends, while also <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> hull structure to withstand the more-severe weather conditions that the Soviets commonly encountered.|$|E

5|$|The {{next five}} days saw very heavy {{fighting}} as the Soviets slowly advanced through heavy German defences and repelled German counterattacks. On January 13, bad weather prevented the Soviet side from employing their air force. That day they gained almost no ground and incurred heavy losses. The German side, after their counterattacks {{had failed to}} throw back the Soviet troops, started further <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> area by assembling battle groups using portions of divisions from the quiet parts of the front. These included battle groups from the 1st Infantry Division, the 61st Infantry Division, the 5th Mountain Division and the SS Police Division.|$|E
5|$|The town of Ludlow was {{increasingly}} fashionable and frequented by tourists, with the castle forming a particularly popular attraction. Thomas Warton published an edition of Milton's poems in 1785, describing Ludlow Castle and popularising the links to Comus, <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> castle's {{reputation as a}} picturesque and sublime location. The castle became a topic for painters interested in these themes: J. M. W. Turner, Francis Towne, Thomas Hearne, Julius Ibbetson, Peter de Wint and William Marlowe all produced depictions of the castle during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, usually taking some artistic licence with the details {{in order to produce}} atmospheric works.|$|E

Thus, they addressed the political and economic instability of the Ottoman Empire that struggled to maintain control over different ethnicities and huge territories. As a consequence of that lack of control, many Greeks were impelled to seek protection outside the Ottoman Empire, while the ones that had not abandoned their lands, suffered under a terrible Ottoman regime, and had no educational rights.|$|E

5|$|To {{ensure the}} success of the Chinese counterattack against ROK II Corps, the PVA 40th Corps was {{assigned}} the mission of protecting the PVA 38th Corps' flank against the US 2nd Infantry Division. To accomplish this mission, the PVA 119th Division of the 40th Corps would first attack Somin-dong and to prevent the Americans from <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> Koreans. The 120th Division would then fight its way across the Ch'ongch'on River and tie down the bulk of the US 2nd Infantry Division. Finally, the 118th Division would flank the Americans from the west and capture Kujang-dong from the rear.|$|E
5|$|A 1948 {{review of}} the entire F-84 program {{discovered}} {{that none of the}} F-84B or F-84C aircraft could be considered operational or capable of executing any aspect of their intended mission. The program was saved from cancellation because the F-84D, whose production was well underway, had satisfactorily addressed the major faults. A fly-off against the F-80 revealed that while the Shooting Star had a shorter takeoff roll, better low altitude climb rate and superior maneuverability, the F-84 could carry a greater bomb load, was faster, had better high altitude performance and greater range. As a temporizing measure, the USAF in 1949 committed US$8million to implement over 100 upgrades to all F-84Bs, most notably <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> wings. Despite the resultant improvements, the F-84B was withdrawn from active duty by 1952.|$|E
5|$|After {{civil war}} broke out in England in 1135, the third earl, also called William, set about {{improving}} the defences of the castle. He began to build a tall keep {{on top of the}} motte, <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> surrounding earthworks with stone walls. A planned settlement was established alongside the castle, surrounded by its own earthworks and walls, and the Peddars Way was redirected to pass by the castle, town and priory, all important symbols of the de Warennes' power in the region. Hamelin de Warenne acquired the castle through marriage and curtailed the building work on the keep around 1165, but completed the construction of three large stone gatehouses in the castle and town. One of these, the town's bailey gate, still survives intact.|$|E
