500|$|Geologically, Montpelier {{is built}} on grassy downland and sheep-pasture, beneath which is chalk. [...] This pattern is {{repeated}} across {{the rest of the}} city, most of the Sussex coast and for several miles inland. The chalk, [...] "one of the most complete and accessible strata anywhere in Europe", was formed about 100 million years ago. As in other areas where chalk is prevalent, the soil above it is <b>rendzina.</b> [...] Found in thin layers and with a high calcium content, it has a poor agricultural value.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new species}} [...] is {{restricted}} to humid chromic luvic cambisols in the high altimediterranean level. The eu- to supramediterranean I. pseudopallida in contrast is widespread on bare limestones or initial rendzic leptosols (<b>Rendzina)</b> {{in a variety of}} mediterranean and submediterranean alliances of coastal karst plains, on megacliffs in the Ephedero-Cyxthoselinetum palmoidis alliance and on montane limestone escarpments in the Campanula-Moltkeetum petaeae H-Iċ alliance.|$|E
2500|$|The yew {{woodland}} in {{the park}} is known as Reenadinna Wood. It is about [...] in size and is located on low-lying karst limestone pavement between Muckross Lake and Lough Leane on Muckross Peninsula. Yew woodland is the rarest habitat type {{in the park}}. Yew woodlands {{are one of the}} rarest types of woodland in Europe, mostly restricted to western Ireland and southern England. It has priority habitat status under Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive. Reenadinna Wood {{is also one of the}} largest woods that are dominated by common yew (Taxus baccata L.) in the UK and Ireland. It is the only significant area of yew woodland in Ireland and is one of just three pure yew woodlands in Europe. It is of considerable ecological and conservation interest, as yew is rarely a woodland dominant. The western limit of the wood lies along the geological boundary with Devonian Old Red Sandstone. The wood is bounded to the east by parkland where the limestone no longer outcrops. Muckross bog, a raised bog [...] in area, is in the southern part of the wood. There are hollows between the limestone outcrops. Deep <b>rendzina</b> soils have developed in some of the hollows. It is estimated that the wood developed 3,000–5,000 years ago.|$|E
40|$|The {{humification}} {{degrees of}} humic acids extracted from calcareous and decarbonated <b>Rendzinas</b> under different land use were characterized upon their optical properties, {{to evaluate the}} influence of carbonate leaching (decarbonation) and different land uses. Decarbonation influenced the humification degree of humic acids positively. Base leaching and acidification of decarbonated <b>Rendzinas</b> led to a decrease in humification degree of humic acids. In calcareous <b>Rendzinas,</b> the humification degree of humic acids was in descending order: grassland>arable land>forest land, and in decarbonated Rendzinas: arable land>grassland>forest land. The humification degree of humic acids was higher in the calcareous forest and grassland <b>Rendzinas</b> compared to decarbonated <b>Rendzinas,</b> analogously in decarbonated arable land compared to calcareous arable land <b>Rendzinas.</b> Differences in the humification degree of humic acids among various land uses that emerged between calcareous and decarbonated <b>Rendzinas</b> indicate the dominant influence of soil chemical characteristics (carbonate content and pH value) compared with {{the quantity and quality}} of the organic litter input...|$|R
40|$|The <b>rendzinas</b> {{were studied}} in the {{community}} of beech, fir and spruce with Scots pine (Piceo-Fago-Abietetum subass. pinetosum silvestris), at the altitudes above 1, 000 m, on steep slopes and warm aspects. The genesis and properties of these <b>rendzinas</b> were strongly affected by chemical composition, mineralogical structure and bedrock weathering. Soft limestones, which are characterized by low hardness and a higher content of insoluble residue, present the major impact on the physical and chemical characteristics of <b>rendzinas.</b> The presence of active carbonates in the profile causes a neutral to weak alkaline reaction, provides the constant buffering of organic acids and the formation of Ca-humates, and in this way also the formation of a stable organic-mineral complex, which in turn results in the formation of stable grainy soil structure...|$|R

40|$|The human {{agricultural}} activity leads to very strong {{changes in the}} soil &# 8211; even the period of several decades of fallowing {{as well as the}} restitution of potential vegetation communities are not able to level those transformations. The climatic changes and agricultural use discontinuation from calcareous soils are caused to coming into existence the climax forest communications on these areas. <b>Rendzinas</b> that were agriculturally used in the past, despite the development of secondary xerothermic swards differ in their hydrophysical properties from the soils occupied by the primary swards. In this work the impact of the way of land use and the natural successive transformations of vegetation on the hydrophysical properties of <b>rendzinas</b> were shown. The surface horizons of cultivated and fallow <b>rendzinas</b> (in comparison with the respective horizons of soils overgrown by primary xerothermic vegetation) are characterized by greater bulk density, lower water retention in the full range of the studied soil water potentials, smaller number of pores, especially of the large pores (dia > 18. 5 &# 181;m). Water retention and conductivity for soil water potential > 1 hPa of surface horizons of fallow <b>rendzinas</b> are close to the values that are characteristic for soils overgrown by shrubs, this being a possible cause of the instability of secondary xerothermic swards {{as well as of the}} fast rate of succession in the direction of shrub and forest communities...|$|R
40|$|We studied soil {{conditions}} and floristic comsposition {{in the forest}} of beech and Hairy Alpenrose (Rhododendro hirsuti-Fagetum) and in the south-Alpine Austrian black pine forest (Fraxino orni-Pinetum nigrae) within {{the area of the}} forest fire in Govci (which is located in the northwestern edge of the Trnovski gozd plateau, western Slovenia) and compared them with conditions in preserved beech and black pine forests five years after the wildfire. The black pine forest overgrows Lithosols and Moder <b>Rendzinas.</b> In the beech forest beside these soils, more-developed Mull <b>Rendzinas</b> and Brown <b>Rendzinas</b> have evolved as well. On the scene of forest fire fertility, thickness and areal shares of soils were greatly reduced and surface stoniness with rockiness proved to be increased. Vegetation of the burnt forests differs from preserved forests mostly in the abundant appearance of some species characteristic for forest clearings and burnt sites (class Epilobietea angustifolii). In the moss layer species Ceratodon purpureus, Polytrichum juniperinum and Marchantia polymorpha are typical for places of the fire (the last two especially for the burnt beech forest) ...|$|R

50|$|The most typical soil is the <b>rendzina</b> (a dark, grayish-brown, humus-rich, intrazonal soil) and {{the brown}} forest soil.|$|E
50|$|To {{the west}} of the ridge lies black <b>rendzina</b> soil which is poorly drained, and so is much less {{favourable}} for vines. There is also a 'transitional', or brown <b>rendzina,</b> soil which grows vines quite successfully. This geological complexity led to many disputes during an eight-year period before Coonawarra was entered on the Register of Protected Names. At least one vineyard (belonging to Penola High School) has the boundary pass through the middle.|$|E
50|$|Rankers are soils {{developed}} over non-calcareous material, usually rock. They are regarded in some soil classifications as lithomorphic soils, a group {{which also includes}} <b>rendzinas,</b> similar soils over calcareous material. They are often called A/C soils, as the topsoil or A horizon is immediately over a C horizon (unaltered parent material).|$|R
50|$|The Gäue are intensively farmed regions, whose soils mainly {{consist of}} brown earths (Parabraunerden) on loess. In the {{so-called}} Poor Gäue (Arme Gäue) {{there is no}} covering of loess: on the karstified limestones of the Upper Muschelkalk, generally only shallow and less fertile <b>rendzinas</b> have developed. Hedges have formed on the Lesesteinriegeln (Heckengäu).|$|R
50|$|The main {{settlements}} are {{the town}} of Swindon in the west, {{and the city of}} Oxford, in the centre. Otherwise the area is relatively sparsely populated with small nucleated villages along the crest of the ridge and along the springline. Soils comprise a mix of heavy <b>rendzinas,</b> stagnogleys and lighter sandy brown earths with small patches of sandy soils.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Rendzina</b> soils {{typically}} develop from solid or unconsolidated rocky {{material that}} is carbonate- or sulfate-rich. Limestone {{is by far the}} most common, but others include dolomite, gypsum, marble, chalk and marlstone.Alongside physical weathering, which breaks down the structure of rocky material, chemical weathering, in particular the dissolution of carbonate, contributes to <b>Rendzina</b> development. When water with dissolved carbon dioxide comes into contact with carbonate minerals, the carbonate is dissolved and leaches out with the water. The overall reaction is as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{soil profile}} of chalk downland in England {{is a thin}} soil {{overlaying}} the parent chalk. Weathering of the chalk has created a characteristic soil known as <b>rendzina.</b> Unlike many soils {{in which there are}} easily distinguished layers or soil horizons, a chalk <b>rendzina</b> soil consists of only a shallow dark humus rich surface layer which grades through a lighter brown hillwash containing small pellets of chalk, to the white of the chalk itself. This is largely because of the purity of the chalk, which is about 98% calcium carbonate, and the consequent absence of soil-building clay minerals which are abundant, for example, in valley floors.|$|E
40|$|Two new localities of Veronica praecox {{have been}} found in {{vicinity}} of Polichno village, near Chęciny, both in EE 8203 ATPOL square (S Poland, central part of Małopolska Upland). Species grows in winter cereal cultivation and fallow on <b>rendzinas.</b> Populations at both localities are thre-atened as a result of intensification of agricultural practices (using herbicides and fertilizers) or successional changes that occur at fallow...|$|R
40|$|In the Kodry Hills, {{small areas}} of virgin beech forests stands are preserved. These beech groves are {{developed}} on specific intrazonal lithomorphic soils. The mineralogical composition of substrate impedes {{the development of}} eluvial−illuvial processes and leaching of carbonates typical of the zonal soils that form under broad-leaved forests.

50|$|The McLaren {{district}} has many different soil types and this {{contributes to the}} wines from the area having different terroir. The vineyards are planted on soils including fertile red-brown earths, terra rossa, <b>rendzina,</b> soft sands and dark cracking clays.|$|E
50|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} clay and humus content produce dark colors and crumb structure. Typical pH for <b>Rendzina</b> soils is between 5 and 8, and base saturation is high. Calcium and magnesium are abundant, but potassium content is often low, so nutrient imbalances are common.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{south-west}} facing {{slope of}} Oolitic limestone slope. The thin <b>rendzina</b> soils become richer colluvial deposits {{in the valley}} floor.

50|$|About half of {{the trees}} in semi-deciduous forests are evergreen, along with shrubs, epiphytes, a few {{herbaceous}} plants, and many vines. Trees {{in this type of}} forest are often mesophyllous, with leaves 13 - 26 cm long. The canopy in forests with consistent moisture reaches a height of 15 - 20 m and may have emergent species up to 30 m high as well as 25 m palms. The lower arboreal story includes deciduous and sclerophyllous evergreen trees. Soils are either red <b>rendzinas,</b> black <b>rendzinas,</b> or brown soils. Trees grow rapidly due to heavy rainfall during the summer. The upper layer of trees includes almácigo (Bursera simaruba), cedro-cheiroso (Cedrela odorata), dagame (Calophyllum candidissimum), ceiba (Ceiba pentandra), baría (Cordia gerascanthus), ateje (C. collococca), cuyá (Dipholis salicifolia), caoba (Swietenia mahagoni), ayúa (Zanthoxylum martinicense), guasiriano (Celtis trinervia) and palma real (Roystonea regia). The lower layer includes jía (Casearia hirsuta), guara (Cupania americana), yamagua (Guarea trichiloides), yaya (Oxandra lanceolata) and siguaraya (Trichilia havanensis). Forests with fluctuating moisture have an 8 - 15 m canopy, an understory of microphyllous and thorny deciduous species, and a forest floor covered in herbaceous geophytes.|$|R
50|$|The Cuban cactus scrub is a xeric shrubland {{ecoregion}} that occupies 3300 km2 on the leeward {{coast of}} Cuba.

5000|$|The term <b>Rendzina</b> {{originated}} {{from an old}} Polish word [...] "rzędzić", which means [...] "to chatter". Soils of this type contain {{a significant amount of}} gravel and stones, which, during plowing, produce various sound effects (clicking, screeching, etc.), i.e., [...] "talk" [...] to the ploughman.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{areas for}} <b>Rendzina</b> soils are in karst and {{mountain}} landscapes, where carbonate-rich material occurs on slopes.
