It must be mixed before use (liquid resin and powdered catalyst). It has a dark purple color which may be objectionable in some uses. Toxic. For many years, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that [...] "Resorcinol is the only known adhesive recommended and approved for use in wooden aircraft structure and fully meets necessary strength and durability requirements" [...] for certificated aircraft, however in fact {{the vast majority of}} wooden aircraft built in recent decades (mostly amateur-built aircraft) instead use other types of adhesives (primarily epoxy resin systems) which offer greater strength and even more importantly, much less criticality in perfect application technique. Most newer adhesives are much more tolerant to typical construction mistakes (such as small gaps or misalignments between parts) than resorcinol, which offers virtually no tolerance for such everyday construction situations. This can pose major difficulties, especially in complex assemblies. However, resorcinol is still used by some builders/restorers, and is commonly seen in vintage aircraft.|$|E

Different amount of silicon in the ceramer exhibits varying temperature of thermal stability and lower coefficient of thermal expansion as compared to pure <b>resorcinol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin.</b> The lower value of CTE in ceramer is due to existence of silica and resorcinol-formaldehyde in co-continuous phase.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the impact of {{treatment}} procedures on roots previously treated with <b>resorcinol–formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> and analyze the effectiveness of dye and magnification for the detection of dentin cracks. Materials and methods: Distal roots of 80 permanent first mandibular molars with a single canal were sectioned at 3  mm and 9  mm from the anatomical apex. Two groups were formed according to the method used for root canal penetration: group 1 (K-file and Pro Taper instruments) and group 2 (Ultrasound with Pro Ultra and Pro Taper files). Before and after the completion of procedures, photographs of the roots were taken for examination for cracks or/and infraction lines with two levels of magnification and with or without a dye. Results: In groups 1 and 2, either with dye or without it, there were statistically significant differences (P <  0. 001) with more fractures observed in the coronal than in the apical part of specimens. Statistically significant proportional differences regarding the location of fractures were observed at both magnifications. When the dye was used, there were no statistically significant differences between the two magnifications in the detection of cracks. In the specimens where the dye was not used, differences between the groups were statistically significant at both magnifications with more complete and intra-dental fractures observed in group 2.

Initial concentrations of non-radioactive cesium in the waste sample were varied to generate an equilibrium isotherm for cesium. Two additional tests were conducted using a liquid to solid phase ratio of 10 and a contact time of 120 hours.

The effect of replacing resorcinol with bio-oil on the properties, bonding performance, and characterization of resorcinol-aldehyde resin was comparatively investigated. A higher solid content and viscosity, albeit a lower shear strength, was found when the replacement ratio of bio-oil increased.

The main focus {{is the development}} of inorganic and carbonaceous porous materials for catalysis, templating and gas storage applications. Three distinct methods of synthesis are investigated, namely: (i) hydrothermal synthesis of zeotype aluminosilicates, (ii) nanocasting techniques for templated carbons and (iii) sol-gel processes, with/without metal salt 'porogen', to carbon aerogels. Post-synthesis modification methods for carbonaceous materials include supercritical carbon dioxide mediated incorporation of palladium nanoparticles into zeolite templated carbons and chemical activation for carbon aerogels result ing in enhanced textural properties. Chapter 1 : Provides the foundation and background to the main themes of nanostructured porous materials investigated in this work. Information about fundamental properties and applications is emphasised. Chapter 2 : Gives a brief background of techniques used for characterisation of the porous materials generated in this research programme. Gas sorption techniques used to probe hydrogen storage and carbon dioxide uptake are also presented. Chapter 3 : Describes stepwise experimental techniques followed in the preparation of various porous materials. The chapter also describes the instrumentation used in these techniques. Chapter 4 - 7 : Each chapter reports a separate but sequential area of research in which appropriate additional theory and background is provided with associated literature review. This is followed by a results and discussion section, with a concluding summary for each chapter. Chapter 4 : Details the synthesis of ordered mesoporous aluminosilicates, which exhibit some zeolisation, prepared from a recipe conventionally used for the synthesis of Eric Masika PhD 2012 Fabrication of Nanostructured Inorganic and Carbon Porous Materials for Catalysis and Gas Storage Applications microporous zeolite BEA. The porosity of the alum inosilicates is modified by simple washing and/or refluxing (in water) of either on the as-synthesised mesophase or the calcined material. The aluminosilicates have excellent hydrothermal stability and strong acidity and thus combine the best properties from mesoporous materials and zeolites. Chapter 5 : Describes the preparation of zeolite templated carbons (ZTC) generated as replicas of zeolite Y via a hard template nanocasting process. In order to enhance hydrogen storage, the ZTCs are impregnated with Palladium nanoparticles using supercritical carbon dioxide solvent, scC 02, as environmentally benign reaction media. The Pd-doped ZTCs exhibit enhanced hydrogen storage due to optimised (with respect to metal content and particle size) incorporation of Pd. Chapter 6 : A two-step process for the generation of zeolite templated carbons (ZTCs) was investigated. In this case the nanocasting technique involves liquid impregnation of zeolite 13 X with furfuryl alcohol followed by chemical vapour deposition (CVO) of ethylene at variable CVD temperatures. The two-step process was a successful attempt to optimise the replication of the zeolite structure in the carbons. The ZTCs had very high surface area and excellent mechanical stability, and achieved the highest hydrogen storage capacity (7. 3 wt% at 77 K and 20 bar) ever reported for any carbon material.

Several steps are required in the ion-exchange process to achieve the required Cs separation factors: loading, displacement, washing, elution, and regeneration. The sRF resin will be operated over a wide range in pH (i. e., pH of 12 - 14 during the loading step and pH of 0. 01 - 1 during the elution step). During some of these steps very high levels of counter-ions and co-ions will be present within the aqueous phase. Alternative process feeds are under consideration as well (e. g., sodium levels as high as 8 M and column operation up to 45 C during loading, reduced and recycled HNO{sub 3 } during elution). In order to model the performance of sRF resin through an entire ion-exchange cycle, a more robust isotherm model is required. To achieve this more robust isotherm model requires knowledge of the numbers and kinds of fixed ionogenic groups that make up sRF. Recent literature reviews and scoping titration tests strongly indicate that sRF is a polyfunctional cation exchange resin with at least three dominant types of ring groups playing a role in its isotherm behavior over the wide pH range of operations. Also three types of fixed ionogenic acid groups are present: sulfonic (SO{sub 3 }H{sup -}) groups; carboxylic (COOH{sup -}) groups, and resorcylic (OH{sup -}) groups. It is this premise that we are working under {{in the development of a}} robust isotherm model for sRF over its entire planned pH operating range. The application of prototypic isotherms for modeling ion-exchange column behavior is demonstrated in Section 3 of this report. This preliminary work served to focus the development effort on the use of a mass-action based isotherm. In Section 4 of this report, the foundational material required to develop a robust isotherm model for sRF is provided. The paths taken, and choices made, are given for the reader to better understand our current status with respect to this goal and to highlight our most recent understanding of sRF exchange equilibria. Our ultimate goal is to update the CERMOD code (Aleman and Hamm, 2007) with a robust isotherm model for sRF that spans the entire pH and concentration ranges of planned operations. The isotherm model will then be used in the VERSE-LC code to model an entire ion-exchange cycle...|$|R

Department of Energy’s Office of River Protection (DOE-ORP) {{for use in the}} Pretreatment Facility (PTF) of the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) and for potential application in at-tank deployment. Numerous studies have shown SRF resin to be effective for removing 137 Cs {{from a wide variety of}} actual and simulated tank waste supernatants (Adamson et al. 2006; Blanchard et al. 2008; Burgeson et al. 2004; Duignan and Nash 2009; Fiskum et al. 2006 a; Fiskum et al. 2006 b; Fiskum et al. 2006 c; Fiskum et al. 2007; Hassan and Adu-Wusu 2003; King et al. 2004; Nash et al. 2006). Prior work at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has focused primarily on the loading behavior for 4 to 6 M Na solutions at 25 to 45 °C. Recent proposed changes to the WTP ion exchange process baseline indicate that loading may include a broader range of sodium molarities (0. 1 to 8 M) and higher temperatures (50 °C) to alleviate post-filtration precipitation issues. This report discusses ion exchange loading kinetics testing activities performed in accordance with Test Plan TP-WTPSP- 002, Rev. 3. 0, which was prepared and approved in response to the Test Specification 24590 PTF-TSP-RT- 09 - 002, Rev. 0 (Lehrman 2010) and Test Exception 24590 PTF TEF RT- 11 - 00003, Rev. 0 (Meehan 2011). This testing focused on column tests evaluating the impact of elevated temperature on resin degradation over an extended period of time and batch contacts evaluating the impact on Cs loading over a broad range of sodium concentrations (0. 1 to 5 M). These changes may be required to alleviate post-filtration precipitation issues and broaden the data range of SRF resin loading under the conditions expected with the new equipment and process changes...|$|R

Phenolic resin, a three-dimensional network structured polymer, has become a fascinating precursors and widely used to synthesis the CSs due to the low cost, high thermal stability and easy transform to carbon materials [14, 19, 20]. In 2011, Liu et al. [21] firstly extended the Stöber method to synthesis <b>resorcinol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> polymer spheres and CSs with highly uniform and controllable size. Thereafter, a lot of Stöber-like methods have been developed and used to prepare N-doped CSs [22 – 24]. For examples, Lu and co-workers [25] have utilized the hexamethylenetetramine polymerize with resorcinol to fabricate the N-containing (1.21  at.%) ultramicroporous CSs under the Stöber condition. The obtained N-doped CSs as electrode materials for supercapacitors exhibited a high specific capacitance of 269  F g−[*] 1 at 1.0 A g−[*] 1. Tian et al. [26]. have successfully prepared the N-doped CSs with high nitrogen content from 5.5  wt% to 11.9  wt% by Stöber-like method that shown a good electrochemical capacitance of 127  F g−[*] 1 at 10  mV s−[*] 1. However, most of those Stöber-like synthetic methods generally required complicated procedures and/or a long processing time (usually more than 24  h), and many of these CSs exhibited a limited specific capacitance and unsatisfactory energy density. Therefore, it is a great challenge to developing a facile and rapid strategy to prepare N-doped CSs, which can satisfies the requirement for high performance supercapacitor applications.|$|E
40|$|Polyester cord play an {{important}} role in the modern tyre industry as a reinforcing materials because of their extraordinary mechanical and physical properties. Many problems concerning to the adhesion between polyester cords an tyre rubber come from the relatively low surface energy of polyethyleneterephtalate (PET) and also its chemical inertness. The standard method for improvement of adhesion between the reinforcing polyester cords and rubber matrix is established on surface modification of cords with solution or emulsion consisting of <b>resorcinol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> and vinyl pyridine latex 1, 2. The aim of this work is to present some results ob-tained by the studying of the influence of temperature and time of vulcanization on adhesion of polyester high modulus low shrinkage cord yarn (HMLS − Slovkord 1440 Dtex 1 x 2, twists 380 / 380 produced by SH Senica, Slovakia) to rubber. The rubber compounds contained natural rubber, SBR and polybutadiene rubber was used for fabric coating. The static adhesion strength to rubber and adhesion strength after dynamic stress (the sample was exposed to a cyclic flexural stress with frequency = 7. 5 Hz for 12 h in a chamber at 80 ± 1. 5 °C) to rubber was studied by means of Henley test method according to STN 6201464. The crosslink density of rubber matrix was de-termined from the results of their swelling in xylene at laboratory temperature according by ASTM D 6814 - 02. The study was based on two-factor five-levels experi-ment. The first factor was temperature of vulcanization (x 1) and the second factor was time vulcanization (x 2).

40|$|Vitrification {{has been}} {{declared}} by the Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as the Best Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT) for the permanent disposal of high-level radioactive waste. Savannah River Site currently uses a sodium tetraphenylborate (NaTPB) precipitation process to remove Cs- 137 from a wastewater solution created from the processing of nuclear fuel. This process has several disadvantages such as {{the formation of a}} benzene waste stream. It has been proposed to replace the precipitation process with an ion exchange process using a new <b>resorcinol-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> developed by Savannah River Technical Center (SRTC). Preliminary tests, however, showed that problems such as crust formation and a reduced final glass wasteform exist when the resin is placed in the melter environment. The newly developed stirred melter could be capable of overcoming these problems. This research explored the operational feasibility of using the stirred tank melter to vitrify an organic ion exchange resin. Preliminary tests included crucible studies to determine the reducing potential of the resin and the extent of oxygen consuming reactions and oxygen transfer tests to approximate the extent of oxygen transfer into the molten glass using an impeller and a combination of the impeller and an external oxygen transfer system. These preliminary studies were used as a basis for the final test which was using the stirred tank melter to vitrify nonradioactive cesium loaded organic ion exchange resin. Results from this test included a cesium mass balance, a characterization of the semi-volatile organic compounds present in the off gas as products of incomplete combustion (PIC), a qualitative analysis of other volatile metals, and observations relating to the effect the resin had on the final redox state of the glass...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHeterogeneous acid {{catalysts}} {{were prepared}} by sulfonation of nanoporous carbons (NPCs). The NPCs were produced by pyrolysis of <b>resorcinol–formaldehyde</b> nanoporous <b>resins</b> (NPRs). The NPRs were synthesized as wet gels by condensation of resorcinol and formaldehyde in a sol–gel polycondensation using Na 2 CO 3 as catalyst. A cationic polyelectrolyte (poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride)) {{was used as}} pore stabilizer, allowing to dry the gels in air without any special procedures. Five NPRs with different properties were synthesized by varying the monomer to catalyst ratio (Resorcinol/Na 2 CO 3, R/C). The morphological and textural characterizations of the NPCs were performed by scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. The results indicate that using a molar ratio of R/C= 200, a nanoporous carbon NPC with large surface area (695 m 2 /g) is obtained. This NPC was sulfonated by reaction with three different sulfonating agents: (i) concentrated sulfuric acid; (ii) fuming sulfuric acid and (iii) chlorosulfonic acid {{in order to obtain}} a novel Fischer esterification catalyst. The amount of acid groups attached to the NPC surface was determined by titration using a modified Boehm method. The catalytic activity, for Fischer esterification reaction of different sulfonated NPCs, was compared with sulfonated NPRs, sulfonated commercial porous carbons and polymeric acid catalyst (cationic ion exchange resins, sulfonated fluoropolymers). The modification of NPCs with concentrated sulfuric acid seems to render the materials with more catalytic activity. The best sulfonated material NPC (PC 200 -H 2 SO 4) shows a high catalytic activity for the esterification of acetic acid (90. 8 %) and oleic acid (60. 6 %) with ethanol. The conversion and conversion rate values are better than commercial acid catalysts. The results suggest that sulfonated NPC catalysts are promising materials for the synthesis of biodiesel and related reactions...|$|R
40|$|The 177 {{underground}} storage tanks at the DOE`s Hanford Site contain an estimated 180 {{million tons of}} high-level radioactive wastes. It is desirable to remove and concentrate the highly radioactive fraction of the tank wastes for vitrification. <b>Resorcinol-formaldehyde</b> (R-F) <b>resin,</b> an organic ion-exchange resin with high selectivity and capacity for the cesium ion, which is a candidate ion-exchange material for use in remediation of tank wastes. The report includes information on the structure/function analysis of R-F resin and the synthetic factors that affect performance of the resin. CS- 100, a commercially available phenol-formaldehyde (P-F) resin, and currently the baseline ion-exchanger for removal of cesium ion at Hanford, is compared with the R-F resin. The primary structural unit of the R-F resin was determined to consist of a 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrasubstituted resorcinol ring unit while CS- 100, was composed mainly of a 1, 2, 4 -trisubstituted ring. CS- 100 shows the presence of phenoxy-ether groups, and this {{may account for the}} much lower decontamination factor of CS- 100 for cesium ion. Curing temperatures for the R-F resin were found to be optimal at 105 [...] 130 C. At lower temperatures, insufficient curing, hence crosslinking, of the polymer resin occurs and selectivity for cesium drops. Curing at elevated temperatures leads to chemical degradation. Optimal particle size for R-F resin is in the range of 20 [...] 50 mesh-sized particles. R-F resin undergoes chemical degradation or oxidation which destroys ion-exchange sites. The ion-exchange sites (hydroxyl groups) are converted to quinones and ketones. CS- 100, though it has much lower performance for cesium ion-exchange, is significantly more chemically stable than R-F resin. To gamma radiation, CS- 100 is more radiolytically stable than R-F resin...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} ion {{exchange}} materials are being evaluated {{as part of}} the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) Pretreatment Project for the removal of {sup 137 }Cs from aqueous tank wastes. Two of these materials are organic resins; a phenol-formaldehyde resin (Duolite CS- 100) produced by Rohm and Haas Co. (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) and a <b>resorcinol-formaldehyde</b> (RF) <b>resin</b> produced by Boulder Scientific Co. (Mead, Colorado). One of the key parameters in the assessment of the organic based ion exchange materials is its useful lifetime in the radioactive and chemical environment that will be encountered during waste processing. The focus of the work presented in this report is the radiation stability of the CS- 100 and the RF resins. The scope of the testing included one test with a sample of the CS- 100 resin and testing of two batches of the RF resin (BSC- 187 and BSC- 210). Samples of the exchangers were irradiated with a {sup 60 }Co source to a total absorbed dose of 10 {sup 9 } R over a period of 5 months in a static (no flow) and a flowing configuration with neutralized current acid waste (NCAW) simulant as a feed. Based on a maximum concentration of {sup 137 }Cs on the resin that would result from processing NCAW, this dose represents an operational period of at least 150 days for the RF resin and at least 1260 days for the CS- 100 resin. Gas generation in the static experiment was continuously monitored and G values (molecules of gas per 100 eV) were determined for each species. Resin samples were obtained periodically and the equilibrium behavior of the resins was assessed by determining the distribution coefficients (K{sub d}s).
