25|$|In April 2001, Logistics Management Institute (LMI) {{completed}} their final {{report for the}} 'Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for the USMC Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR), concluding the best option was to rebuy a vehicle similar to the technology demonstrator. Five alternative options had been considered, these were: Inspect and Replace Only As Necessary (IROAN) for the LVS; rebuild the LVS; <b>re-manufacture</b> the LVS to a higher standard; rebuy a vehicle similar to the technology demonstrator; research and develop an entirely new vehicle. Around {{this time it was}} suggested that 2,000-3,000 vehicles might be required, although throughout the program numbers would fluctuate.|$|E
25|$|Fabless licensees, {{who wish}} to {{integrate}} an ARM core into their own chip design, are usually only interested in acquiring a ready-to-manufacture verified semiconductor intellectual property core. For these customers, ARM Holdings delivers a gate netlist description of the chosen ARM core, along with an abstracted simulation model and test programs to aid design integration and verification. More ambitious customers, including integrated device manufacturers (IDM) and foundry operators, choose to acquire the processor IP in synthesizable RTL (Verilog) form. With the synthesizable RTL, the customer {{has the ability to}} perform architectural level optimisations and extensions. This allows the designer to achieve exotic design goals not otherwise possible with an unmodified netlist (high clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions, etc.). While ARM Holdings does not grant the licensee the right to resell the ARM architecture itself, licensees may freely sell manufactured product such as chip devices, evaluation boards and complete systems. Merchant foundries can be a special case; not only are they allowed to sell finished silicon containing ARM cores, they generally hold the right to <b>re-manufacture</b> ARM cores for other customers.|$|E
500|$|On 11 July 2016, the UK Ministry of Defence {{confirmed}} a $2.3 billion {{order for}} 50 AH-64Es {{to be built}} in Mesa, Arizona. The purchase is via a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) agreement with the US government. [...] Leonardo Helicopters in the UK is to maintain the current fleet of Apaches until 2023–2024, with a long-term plan for Leonardo and other UK companies to [...] "do most of the work" [...] on the new fleet. The deal includes an initial support contract for maintenance of the new helicopters, along with spare parts and training simulators for UK pilots. The first UK helicopters are due off the US production line in early 2020 and will begin entering service with the British Army in 2022. [...] "To further guarantee value for money, systems from the current Apache fleet, such as the Modernised Target Acquisition & Designation System, and the Longbow Fire Control Radar, will be reused and incorporated into the new helicopters where possible." [...] Approval for the <b>re-manufacture</b> of fifty of the UK's WAH-64 Mk 1 fleet to AH-64E Apache Guardian standard had been given by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency in August 2015. The aircraft will utilise the General Electric T700 engine rather than the Turbomeca RTM322 from the current fleet; the first off-the-shelf purchase of a GE engine by the UK MOD.|$|E
50|$|Next step is {{to check}} for overall {{straightness}} of the <b>re-manufactured</b> crankshaft once again. If the <b>re-manufactured</b> crankshaft is out of alignment then the technician repeats step 7 and re-straighten the structure. Each of the <b>re-manufactured</b> crankshafts is checked multiple times throughout the re-manufacturing process to ensure quality control. If the straightness is not compromised the rebuilt crankshafts can proceed to step fourteen which is crankshaft grinding.|$|R
50|$|The first five, <b>re-manufactured</b> in 1983 {{and early}} 1984 were outshopped without steam {{generators}} became Via Rail class GPA-418a while the remainder, <b>re-manufactured</b> with Vapor-OK steam generators in mid-1984 to mid-1985 became Via Rail class GPA-418b.|$|R
5000|$|Via Rail had {{a surplus}} of steam-heated GMD Via FP9A units built in the 1950s and so fifteen of these units were chosen to be <b>re-manufactured.</b> The first twelve units, 6300 - 6311, were <b>re-manufactured</b> at the CN Pointe St-Charles shops in Montreal while the final three, 6312 - 6314, were <b>re-manufactured</b> at the CN shops in Moncton, New Brunswick. As part of the re-manufacturing many {{original}} components were replaced or upgraded - the original 16-567C engines were rebuilt with 645E series power assemblies, and the Woodward governor was revised, thereby raising the net power for traction from [...]|$|R
2500|$|The new gearbox {{will be part}} of a {{long term}} project to restore the car to its 1925 specification.

50|$|The AGM-122 Sidearm was {{produced}} by the <b>re-manufacture</b> of AIM-9C missiles that had {{been taken out of}} service. The AIM-9C was a semi-active radar homing variant of the Sidewinder, developed for the US Navy's Vought F-8 Crusader, but used for only a limited period of time. Conceived and developed at China Lake NAWC, the Sidearm was first tested in 1981. In 1984, Motorola was issued a contract to convert and upgrade AIM-9Cs to AGM-122A standard. A total of about 700 units were produced between 1986 and 1990.|$|E
50|$|At {{the request}} of the National Air and Space Museum, the U.S. Navy {{provided}} BuNo 159610 to its Udvar-Hazy location near Dulles International Airport. Although Tomcat BuNo 159610 downed the Libyan MiG-23 as a VF-32 F-14A model Tomcat, it returned from that deployment and was entered into the F-14D <b>re-manufacture</b> program and served later in a precision strike role as a VF-31 F-14D(R). On September 30, 2006, it was formally unveiled to the public with Captain Connelly and Captain Enwright, both now retired, on the podium as honored guests.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally {{recycling}} requires {{large amounts}} of energy to [...] "melt down" [...] and then <b>re-manufacture</b> items. While this may {{cut down on the}} amount of trash that is going into landfills, it is not sustainable unless the underlying energy supply is sustainable. In addition, recycling often means downcycling and always involves at least some loss of the original material, so primary extraction is still required to make up the difference. Precycling reduces these problems by using less material in the first place, so less has to be recycled.|$|E

50|$|Back then a CIDCO {{transaxle}} {{could be}} purchased, this stands for Corvair Improvement Distributing Company as owned by Bob Anderson. At {{one time he}} developed Corvair transaxles with many improvements, not only for Corvairs but the kit car industry as well. Bob improved the longevity of the differentials thru many modifications, <b>re-manufacture</b> and re-engineering, along with careful assembly. This included having reverse cut ring and pinion gears made for the Kelmark transaxle setup which ran in reverse. His setup was in great demand by the mid-engine Corvair enthusiasts. One of the trademarks of the CIDCO diff is the shoulder bolted steel plate cover {{on top of the}} differential in place of the tin cover.|$|E
50|$|The Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles (FHTV) {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Oshkosh by the U.S. Army in March 2001. In addition to the HEMTT (both new and <b>re-manufacture),</b> the contract covered the M1070 HET, M1074, and M1075 Palletized Load System (PLS) trucks, and M1076 PLS trailers and called for up to 5,398 trucks and 1,100 trailers (including options). FHTV covered the production period from March 2001 until mid-fiscal year 2006 (FY06). The FHTV {{contract was}} extended and renegotiated, and in February 2007, Oshkosh announced it had been awarded a contract to continue production of FHTVs. The follow-on FHTV contract (FHTV 2) covered new production of HEMTTs (including current A4 variants from mid-2008) and PLS vehicles plus PLS trailers. In total, 2173 new-build HEMTT A4 and 104 Recap HEMTT A4 were ordered under FHTV 2.|$|E
50|$|The RIM-66B {{introduced}} {{changes that}} resulted in higher reliability. A new faster reacting autopilot, a more powerful dual thrust rocket motor, and a new warhead were added. Many RIM-66A missiles were <b>re-manufactured</b> into RIM-66B.|$|R
50|$|The {{machine shop}} then determines if the proper {{rotational}} {{balance of the}} <b>re-manufactured</b> crankshafts is achieved. In the engine the crankshaft, pistons and rods all in a constant rotation. The counterweights are designed to offset {{the weight of the}} rod and the pistons in the engine. When in motion the kinetic energy and the sum of all forces should be equal to zero on all moving parts. If the <b>re-manufactured</b> crankshaft counterweights are imbalanced it adds additional stress on other components of the engine. The technician should then make sure the internal balance and the external balance of the crankshaft counterweights are properly aligned.|$|R
50|$|On July 22, 2007, repairs were {{completed}} in Labrador, which included installation of two <b>re-manufactured</b> Allison engines. Glacier Girl {{returned to the}} U.S. on July 23, and can now be seen at air shows in the USA.|$|R
