40|$|The “social licence to operate” {{has been}} invoked in science policy discussions {{including}} the 2007 Universal Ethical Code for scientists {{issued by the}} UK Government Office for Science. Drawing from sociological <b>research</b> on social <b>licence</b> and STS interventions in science policy, the authors explore the relevance of expectations of a social <b>licence</b> for scientific <b>research</b> and scientific contributions to public decision-making, and what might be involved in seeking to create one. The process of seeking a social licence {{is not the same}} as trying to create public or community acceptance for a project whose boundaries and aims have already been fully defined prior to engagement. Such attempts to “capture” the public might be successful from time to time but their legitimacy is open to question especially where their engagement with alternative research futures is “thin”. Contrasting a national dialogue on stem cells with the early history of research into bioenergy, we argue that social licence activities need to be open to a “thicker” engagement with the social. Co-constructing a licence suggests a reciprocal relationship between the social and the scientific with obligations for public and private institutions that shape and are shaped by science, rather than just science alone...|$|R

Gov'tBACKGROUND: This study {{investigated}} the risk of cancer in children with alert symptoms identified in current UK guidance, or with increased consultation frequency in primary care. METHODS: A population-based, nested case-control study used data from the General Practice Research Database. In all, 1267 children age 0 - 14 years diagnosed with childhood cancer were matched to 15, 318 controls. Likelihood ratios and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated to assess risk. RESULTS: Alert symptoms recorded in the 12 and 3 months before diagnosis were present in 33. 7 % and 27. 0 % of cases vs 5. 4 % and 1. 4 % of controls, respectively. The PPV of having cancer for any alert symptom in the 3 months before diagnosis was 0. 55 per 1000 children. Cases consulted more frequently particularly in the 3 months before diagnosis (86 % cases vs 41 % controls). Of these, 36 % of cases and 9 % of controls had consulted 4 times or more. The PPV for cancer in a child consulting 4 times or more in 3 months was 0. 13 per 1000 children. CONCLUSION: Alert symptoms and frequent consultations are associated with childhood cancer. However, individual symptoms and consultation patterns have very low PPVs for cancer in primary care (e. g., of 10, 000 children with a recorded alert symptom, approximately 6 would be diagnosed with cancer within 3 months).

The issue comprises the Proceedings of the 2014 Conference of the International Sports Engineering Association: Engineering of Sport 10 held at Sheffield Hallam University on the 14 th- 17 th July 2014. It is published by Elsevier as Open Access under a CC-BY-NC-ND 3. 0 <b>licence.</b> <b>Research</b> into artificial turf surfaces can be divided into the categories infrastructure, user safety and play performance. This paper discusses these three categories, presents current knowledge and appraises some remaining questions. A simple diagrammatic framework is proposed for describing and relating the fundamental components of sport surface related research. Infrastructure includes the design, construction, operation, and whole life costs associated with a facility. A key area for future research is to better understand maintenance and the benefits of various strategies / techniques. User safety, or injury risk, is a key concern for many stakeholders. Injury risk is a complex interaction of many factors related to the user, sport, equipment and environment. Whilst the introduction of an injury consensus in the late 1990 s permitted much greater impact of studies in soccer and rugby, these have contributed little to understanding injury mechanisms. Furthermore, previous research is hampered with regard to the effect of the surface by utilizing simple mechanical tests that appear inappropriate to user activity, e. g. traction. Advancement of knowledge within this category demands better integration with play performance related measurements and research methods that support a more mechanistic approach. Play performance {{has been the focus of}} much recent research. For example, mechanical evaluation of surface systems in the laboratory / field, player testing with regard to player and surface response and perception of surface performance. There exists a real need to develop a ‘consensus’ in establishing suitable boundary conditions for both mechanical and player testing. This would help to identify the fundamental research questions related to play performance and allow improved comparison between research studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} based on {{empirical}} research conducted by the author in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The <b>research</b> comprised <b>licence</b> agreements (for both export and import), concluded between 1981 - 1987 by Polish enterprises with partners from the CMEA countries. Analysing the contents of the contracts the author takes into account the stipulations of the CMEA documents which in the form of "directives" regulate the circulation of so-called „. scientific and technical works". Taken into account were the stipulations of Organizational, Methodical, Economic and Legal Foundations for Scientific and Technological Co-operation of the CMEA Member States of 1972 (in the 1986 version) and the provisions of „model forms of licencing agreements" issued by the CMEA Secretariat in 1975. The purpose of the analysis was to establish to what degree the solutions recommended for application within the CMEA influence the praxis of shaping the contents of contracts. It should be emphasized that licence relations have not yet been regulated in the acts of the so-called „CMEA common '' law". Besides, the author analyses the contents of particular clauses, especially those of importation contracts, from the viewpoint of their agreement with Polish norms regulating the transfer of technology contained in the 1986 Regulation on Principles and Procedure of Exportation and Importation of Scientific and Technical Achievements issued by the Minister of Foreign Trade. The author aims at establishing to what degree Polish licencees are able to secure for themselves preferred elements of the contents of contracts and to what degree contracts for importation of technology from the CMEA countries are tainted with restrictive practices. The author carries out a survey of typical licence clauses, in particular clauses regulating the extent and character of a licence, the transfer of technical documentation, the exchange of technological improvements, the licensor's legal and technical protective measures and the liability for infringing them, technical assistance, licence fees and their payments, measures to protect the secrecy of know- -how, the clauses regulating the settling of disputes and the choice of applicable law. Then, the author turns her attention to the areas of inadequate contractual regulation (especially the problems of liability and the choice of applicable law). She also discovers in importation contracts. concluded with the CMEA countries the existence of practices restricting the economic activity of Polish licences. From among the restrictive clauses indicated in the Regulation of 1986 the author finds the restrictions as to the right of granting sublicences, exportation restrictions and interdictions to question the licensor's protective title. In that connection the author deals with the character of Polish legal norms regulating the transfer of technology and analyses the relation of these provisions to the norms of the Law on Counteracting Monopolistic Practices. She concludes that restrictive licence clauses may be subject to, sanctions provided for in the Law. The last part of her article is devoted to the problem of transfer of technology within joint ventures carried out with partners from the CMEA countries. Legal foundations of such a form of co-operation and means of transfering the technology within joint ventures have been discussed.
