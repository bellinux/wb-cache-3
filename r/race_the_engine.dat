25|$|The engine {{specification}} {{was frozen}} in 2007 to keep development costs down. The engines which {{were used in}} the 2006 Japanese Grand Prix were used for the 2007 and 2008 seasons and they were limited to 19,000 rpm. In 2009 the limit was reduced to 18,000 rpm with each driver allowed to use a maximum of 8 engines over the season. Any driver needing an additional engine is penalised 10 places on the starting grid for the first <b>race</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is used. This increases the importance of reliability, although the effect is only seen {{towards the end of the}} season. Certain design changes intended to improve engine reliability may be carried out with permission from the FIA. This has led to some engine manufacturers, notably Ferrari and Mercedes, exploiting this ability by making design changes which not only improve reliability, but also boost engine power output as a side effect. As the Mercedes engine was proven to be the strongest, re-equalisations of engines were allowed by the FIA to allow other manufacturers to match the power.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993 {{after four}} years in Formula One with only one {{significant}} result for the engine, Bob Lutz of Lamborghini's parent company Chrysler, did a hand-shake deal with McLaren boss Ron Dennis for the team to test the LE3512 to evaluate its potential as a race winner. McLaren made {{a modified version of}} their [...] race car, the McLaren MP4/8 dubbed the MP4/8B, to test the engine (the test car took three months to modify to fit the longer and heavier V12). Testing was completed by triple World Champion Ayrton Senna, and future dual World Champion Mika Häkkinen at both the Silverstone Circuit in England and the Estoril circuit in Portugal. After his first drive of the car at Silverstone, Senna suggested certain changes to Forghieri (a less brutal 'top end' and a fatter mid-range), and he complied with engine power increased from [...] to approximately [...] and both drivers were very impressed despite the engine still being somewhat unreliable (Häkkinen reported a massive engine blow up while testing at Silverstone, though he did manage to lap the 5.226km (3.260mi) circuit some 1.4 seconds faster than the teams MP4/8 race car powered by a [...] Ford V8 engine). According to reports, Senna even wanted to <b>race</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> at the Japanese Grand Prix believing that while reliability might be a problem, at least he would be quicker than with the Ford powered race car (ironically Senna would win in both Japan and the last race in Australia with the existing MP4/8). Despite this however, Ron Dennis decided to go with Peugeot V10 engines in [...] due to a better commercial agreement that would give long term stability to the team {{and at the end of}} the 1993 season, the Lamborghini LE3512 was retired from Grand Prix racing after the company was sold by Chrysler to an Indonesian investor group led by Tommy Suharto.|$|E
50|$|On 28 July 1927, Barnard died in {{a flying}} {{accident}} while flying the Bristol Type 99A Badminton (G-EBMK). He was performance testing alternative propellers on the aircraft in preparation for entering the 1927 King's Cup <b>Race.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> failed after take-off from Filton Aerodrome, and the aircraft stalled from a height of about 80 ft.|$|E
50|$|Qualifying Engine: This engine {{has even}} {{more power than}} <b>the</b> <b>Racing</b> <b>Engine,</b> but can only be used during {{qualifying}} and must be rebuilt after every <b>race.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Racing</b> <b>Engine</b> must be purchased first.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> {{was based}} on a {{production}} Honda K20A <b>engine.</b> For <b>the</b> first season <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was tuned by Heini Mader <b>Racing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> meets FIA Super 2000 regulations, like the WTCC the IFM supports.|$|R
50|$|Three Ernest Henry {{designed}} team {{cars were}} constructed {{for the event}} and a similar fourth test car served as a test, practice and spare car until its engine was ruined by fire before <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> in all three Sunbeam team cars failed and none finished.|$|R
5000|$|For 1965 {{there was}} again {{work on the}} frame and {{the body and the}} {{displacement}} of the engine was increased to 5046.8 cc - this version (151/4) is called the Tipo 154 by some. The driver [...] "Lucky" [...] Casner was killed during practice prior to the <b>race.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> went on to power the Tipo 65 less than 2 months later.|$|E
5000|$|The car first {{appeared}} on a race track in July 1908 in the Coupe de l'Auto <b>race,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> had a capacity of 1460 cc and delivered [...] at 1800 rpm. The top speed of the car was 59 mph, models with a six-cylinder engine were built during the 1910s. After World War I, De Bazelaire manufactured cars with a 2.1 litre S.C.A.P. engine.|$|E
5000|$|... 1999: The book Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women by the American author Elizabeth Wurtzel was published. In the {{successful}} {{declaration of the}} word bitch, Wurtzel introduced her philosophy: [...] "I intend to scream, shout, <b>race</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> call when I feel like it, throw tantrums in Bloomingdale's if I feel like it and confess intimate details about my life to complete strangers. I intend to do what I {{want to do and}} be whom I want to be and answer only to myself: that is, quite simply, the bitch philosophy." ...|$|E
5|$|Both Tigers {{suffered}} early mechanical failures, {{and neither}} finished <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> {{had been prepared}} by Shelby but had not been properly developed, {{and as a result}} overheated; Shelby eventually refunded the development cost to Rootes.

25|$|In 1990, {{the factory}} {{development}} was continued by Scott Brayton and Dominic Dobson, but neither won any <b>races.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> was utilized by other CART teams in 1991–1992, and was retired after {{the introduction of}} the Ford Cosworth XB with only one victory, that being Rahal's in 1989.|$|R
50|$|A 49 cc {{four-stroke}} spark ignited engine {{originating from}} a high-end moped is powering the Dynamo 7.0. The engine {{was in its}} originally application running on gasoline but has been modified to run on ethanol as a green alternative.For this purpose the engine control unit (ECU) had {{to be replaced by}} a custom programmable ECU developed by students participating in the project. The programmable ECU enables user control of the air-fuel ratio. During a <b>race</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is run with a lean mixture to optimize fuel efficiency resulting in a thermal efficiency of approximately 30 percent.|$|E
50|$|The car {{performed}} well in qualifying at the season opener, the Bahrain Grand Prix, with an all Ferrari front row. However {{the performance of}} the car was generally not as fast as the Renault R26 {{in the first half of}} the season.At the Malaysian Grand Prix, the car suffered significant technical problems - a piston problem meant that both drivers had to change their engines during the weekend, incurring qualifying penalties, and for the <b>race</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> speed was limited to prevent a failure. This problem continued to affect the car for the Australian Grand Prix.|$|E
50|$|Charles Kwan {{stayed with}} EKS Motorsport {{and the team}} entered two BMW 320is for the season, one for Kwan and one for Paul Chan. Charles drove {{one of his most}} memorable races at the Batu Tiga Speedway at Shah Alam this year. His engine had broken down during practice. Although his {{teammate}} Paul Chan kindly lent him his engine for the <b>race,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> replacement work meant Charles did not take part in qualifying and had to start the race {{from the back of the}} grid. Amazingly, in the race he passed all the drivers in front of him to claim a superb victory.|$|E

50|$|In late 2006, Mazda {{announced}} {{an agreement with}} Advanced Engine Research (AER) to develop the MZR-R motor for sports car <b>racing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> is a 2.0 L turbocharged I4 based on the production MZR block http://www.b-kmotorsports.com/car-and-engine/. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> will initially {{be used by the}} Mazda factory team in the American Le Mans Series as a replacement for their R20B rotary, then later sold to customer teams.|$|R
5000|$|Honda {{announced}} {{to enter the}} 2012 World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) with a racer built on the 2012 Euro Civic 5 door hatchback. The car is powered by HR412E - a bespoke, new 1.6-liter direct injection turbocharged engine developed by Honda’s R&D centre in Tochigi, Japan, and would race from October in Japan, China and Macau before a two car team join the 2013 championship <b>race.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> aims for higher efficiency and is said to herald [...] "a new generation of high performance racing engines from Honda" [...] and innovations during the engine's development will [...] "further increase the efficiency of Honda's road car engines".|$|E
50|$|About 10 laps {{into the}} <b>race,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> in Fangio's car began misfiring, so {{he stopped at}} the pits to have the magneto changed, but only {{completed}} one further lap before stopping again. Around this time, the gearbox in Ascari's Ferrari had broken, and he retired, although he took over the car of González, who had been pushing very hard. When Fagioli came in for his fuel stop, the team ordered Fagioli and Fangio to swap cars. Fuel stops and problems for the Ferraris enabled Fangio to make his way into the lead and win the race, with Ascari in González's original car finishing 2nd, 52 seconds behind. Fagioli, in Fangio's original car, finished 11th, 22 laps behind.|$|E

5000|$|Ferrari 375 MM, was a {{race car}} {{produced}} by Ferrari in 1953 and 1954. It was named [...] "375" [...] for the per-cylinder displacement in the 4.5L V12 engine, and the [...] "MM" [...] stood for the Mille Miglia <b>race.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> was based on its Ferrari 375 F1 counterpart, but with smaller stroke and bigger bore. The first prototype was a Vignale Spyder and 3 next cars were Pinin Farina Berlinettas, all converted from Ferrari 340 MM. Perhaps the most known 375 MM is the [...] "Ingrid Bergman" [...] version, commissioned in 1954 by director Roberto Rossellini for his wife, actress Ingrid Bergman. The Bergman 375 MM was subsequently bought and restored by the Microsoft executive Jon Shirley and the restoration specialist Butch Dennison. It later became the first postwar Ferrari to win Best of Show at the Pebble Beach Concours dElegance.|$|E
50|$|With Ribbs {{behind the}} wheel of the #36 Duntov 1969 Corvette, it {{appeared}} he was in position to drive to victory. Second place Rick Blaha pitted and handed the car over to Sarah Fisher. Furthermore, race leader Jody O'Donnell in the #46A Corvette never pitted, and he and Roberto Guerrero were disqualified. Willy T. Ribbs re-took the lead but with just minutes left in the <b>race,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> threw a rod and came to a stop out on the track. Sarah Fisher benefited greatly from the resulting full-course caution, and was able to complete the team's driver switch under the yellow. Fisher drove to victory, winning by a full lap over the car of Peter Klutt/Al Unser Jr. Fisher became the first female driver to win an automobile race of any kind at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.|$|E
50|$|The final {{challenge}} was an endurance race - each presenter {{was allowed to}} modify their car with the money {{left over from the}} original purchase. Hammond fitted a poorly constructed bodykit to the BMW. May tried to paint the Jaguar in British racing green (only to run out of paint) and spent the rest fixing the engine. Clarkson had a more professional paint job, and installed an even more powerful turbo. The outcome was unexpected - while Clarksons new turbo made the Mitsubishi the fastest car in the entire <b>race,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> repeatedly overheated and broke down after almost every lap, before one last blow up put him out for good. Hammonds transmission failed {{in the final stages of}} the race, but still beat May by two laps (although the Jaguar suffered wear during the race, it only broke down once when the brake fluid overheated).|$|E
50|$|The Falconer V-12 is a V-12 {{performance}} racing engine {{built by}} Ryan Falconer <b>Racing</b> <b>Engines.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> was first brought to market in 1990 and has roots in small block Chevrolet engines {{and is designed}} for marine and aviation use.|$|R
50|$|Igor Sikorsky {{offered a}} kit {{to replace the}} lower wings with a smaller pair with less drag-producing struts and wires. One example with this {{modification}} and a 150 hp Hispano-Suiza upgrade, was entered in the 1927 National Air <b>Races.</b> Before <b>the</b> <b>races,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was upgraded again to a Hispano-Suiza 220 hp <b>engine,</b> which overwhelmed <b>the</b> cooling system with metal shavings, causing the aircraft {{to drop out of}} <b>the</b> <b>race.</b>|$|R
5000|$|They are {{powered by}} small 4-cycle engines (200 cc), {{generally}} starting out as 5 hp Briggs & Stratton engines originally {{referred to as}} [...] "lawnmower" [...] engines, since that is where <b>the</b> first <b>engines</b> were taken from. After being modified for <b>racing,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> can produce anywhere from 7 to 30+ hp, depending on <b>the</b> <b>racing</b> class. Microstocks were originally designed to hit speeds between 45-65 mph; however, modified racing has pushed them over 100 mph in some cases.|$|R
50|$|This race saw {{the death}} of Brazilian driver Christian Heins when his Alpine M63 Renault was {{involved}} in a fatal accident: five hours into the <b>race,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> of the Bruce McLaren/Innes Ireland Aston Martin DP214 blew up, causing 20 liters of oil to be spilled on the track. Drivers Ninian Sanderson and Michael Salmon avoided the oil, but not Roy Salvadori; his Jaguar E-Type lightweight spun on the oil, became airborne, landed on its roof and burst into flames. Jean-Pierre Manzon in his René Bonnet Aerodjet LM6 hit the Jaguar and stopped {{in the middle of the}} track. Heins, who was leading his class at the time, was unable to avoid the wreck, swerved out of control and hit another vehicle. His car then spun into a lamp post and exploded into flames. Manzon and Salvadori were injured, but Heins died instantly of severe burns and massive head injuries.|$|E
5000|$|In 1962 Thompson entered three John Crosthwaite {{designed}} {{cars in the}} Indianapolis 500. Unusually, {{they used}} a stock V8 Buick engine {{and it was in}} the rear unlike the front engined, race tuned, Offenhauser powered cars used by most competitors. It was the first stock engine to be raced at Indy since 1946. Thompson's crew, led by Fritz Voigt, were young, smart and hard working. Working 12-14 hour days, the car was designed and built in 120 days. For the <b>race,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> (enlarged to 4.2 litre capacity, the maximum allowed by the regulations for “stock block” engines) had to be detuned because they were concerned it would not last the distance. Despite being more than 70 bhp down on the other cars, Dan Gurney qualified eighth and was in ninth place until a leaking oil seal seized the gearbox and ended his race on lap 94. He was placed 20th out of 33. The team won the Mechanical Achievement Award for original design, construction and accomplishment.|$|E
50|$|Leonard {{would return}} to Vel's Parnelli Jones again in 1970, working with famed chief {{mechanic}} George Bignotti. In his first race of the year, the Indianapolis 500 he would drive the #15 Johnny Lightning PJ Colt-Ford. In the race Leonard qualified in 18th place and was soon running in 2nd place to teammate Unser. Leonard's engine would quit after 73 laps and he could only finish in 24th place. It was discovered post <b>race</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> switch had been flipped, meaning {{that there was nothing}} wrong with the engine and that Leonard could have continued. Leonard would then compete in the Rex Mays Classic at Wisconsin State Fairgrounds Park Speedway where he only led the final nine laps on his way to his first victory since 1965 at Milwaukee. Leonard would start one more race that year, the California 500 at Ontario Motor Speedway, where he would qualify in 6th place and would finish in 13th place after spinning out. Leonard would finish out the season 32nd in points.|$|E
