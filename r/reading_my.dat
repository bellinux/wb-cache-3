25|$|Ashcroft {{was born}} in Croydon, Surrey, the younger child and only {{daughter}} of William Worsley Ashcroft (1878–1918), a land agent, and his wife, Violetta Maud, née Bernheim (1874–1926). The biographer Michael Billington writes that Violetta Ashcroft was of Danish and German-Jewish descent and a keen amateur actress. Ashcroft's father was killed on active service in the First World War. She attended Woodford School, East Croydon, where one of her teachers encouraged her love of Shakespeare, but neither her teachers nor her mother approved of her desire to become a professional actress. Ashcroft was determined, however, and {{at the age of}} sixteen, she enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama, run by Elsie Fogerty, from whom her mother had taken lessons some years before. The school's emphasis was on the voice and elegant diction, which did not appeal to Ashcroft or to her fellow pupil Laurence Olivier. She learned more from <b>reading</b> <b>My</b> Life in Art by Constantin Stanislavski, the influential director of the Moscow Art Theatre.|$|E

Rakim wrote his songs in approximately one hour while listening to the beat. He then recorded his vocals in the booth by reading his lyrics from a paper. In 2006, Rakim revealed, [...] "When I hear my first album today I hear myself <b>reading</b> <b>my</b> rhymes but I'm my worst critic." [...] The duo completed the album in one week.

Jackson first wrote to Dickinson to encourage a contribution on August 20, 1876, before attempting to persuade her in person on October 10.

Del Toro said he was nervous about casting the lead role, and that finding the 10-year-old Spanish actress was purely accidental. (The film was shot from June–October 2005, when she was 11.) [...] "The {{character}} I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9, and Ivana came in {{and she was a}} little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But I loved her first <b>reading,</b> <b>my</b> wife was crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age." [...] Baquero says that Del Toro sent her lots of comics and fairy tales to help her [...] "get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt". She says she thought the film was [...] "marvelous", and that [...] "at the same time it can bring you pain, and sadness, and scariness, and happiness".|$|E
