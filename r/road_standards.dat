25|$|After the Second World War, the Minister of Transport {{appointed}} {{engineers to}} inspect <b>road</b> <b>standards</b> between the A580 road (East Lancashire Road) in Swinton and the A1 road near Selby. The 1949 Road Plan for South Lancashire identified {{the need to}} upgrade the A580 to dual carriageway with grade separation and provide bypasses at Huyton and Cadishead. In 1952, the route for a trans-Pennine motorway, the Lancashire–Yorkshire Motorway, was laid down, with Ferrybridge at the eastern terminus rather than Selby. By the 1960s, the proposed A580 upgrade to dual carriageway was considered inadequate, {{and there was an}} urgent need to link Liverpool to the motorway network. The route of the Lancashire-Yorkshire motorway was considered inadequate as it failed to cater for several industrial towns in Yorkshire. When James Drake visited the United States in 1962, his experience of the Interstate Highway System led him to conclude that the Merseyside Expressway, planned to run between Liverpool and the M6, would need to be extended to the Stretford-Eccles Bypass and beyond, to create a continuous motorway between Liverpool and Ferrybridge (a link between Ferrybridge and Hull was not considered until 1964). Initially the plans were unpopular and not supported by the Ministry of Transport, but the scheme was added to the Road Plan in 1963.|$|E

50|$|Kennecott Minerals, in a {{consortium}} with other businesses, originally proposed a privately built {{road in the}} area called Woodland Road. The group included the Michigan Forest Products Council, a local construction company, and local landowners.

AAA), CR 510, CR 550 and US 41/M-28. According to the permit application, the road was also to improve access to the forest lands in the area used by timber companies for logging, and it was to provide enhanced recreational access to remote areas of Marquette County.

He also commented that it is [...] "difficult" [...] due to its size, and, [...] "one of the twitchiest cars", he has ever driven, meaning a small action by the driver results in an exaggerated reaction from the car.

50|$|By 1920, {{the need}} to provide {{all-weather}} roads was a priority for Queenslanders, a response to the increased number of motor vehicles on the roads, and to {{the need to}} provide suitable infrastructure for an expanding economy. Queensland roads were in a deplorable condition, the result of haphazard planning by the then responsible but under-funded local government authorities. In the development of a road network, Queensland lagged far behind the other states. In response, the Queensland Government established the Main Roads Board in 1920 to oversee the construction of connecting roads and bridges and to provide funding to the local authorities involved. In 1925, the Main Roads Board became the Main Roads Commission under John Robert Kemp as Commissioner and continued the overseeing of road and bridge construction throughout Queensland. The Main Roads Board quickly realised that road and bridge specifications and other standards were urgently required {{to improve the quality of}} construction and establish a uniformity of practice. <b>Road</b> <b>standards</b> were therefore established, introducing three classifications of roads in 1925 and a single standard bridge design in 1922-1923. Two years later alternative designs were added to cater for different loadings, labelled First Class (later A Class) and Second Class (B Class). These standards did not change significantly over the next 80 years.|$|E
50|$|The {{first part}} of the road between Lusi and Mikkeli was rebuilt in the 1990s and the 2000s (decade). There is one short length of 2+2 laned road at Mikkeli, but the part between Mikkeli and Joroinen needs {{updating}} because it does not meet modern requirements. The next part between Joroinen and Varkaus has been constructed up to the national road standard and there is a 9 kilometer long bypass at Varkaus. Also, the next part of the road between Joroinen and Leppävirta is in good condition and many bypasses have been constructed, but the part from Leppävirta to Kuopio's Humaljoki is not in a good condition. At Humaljoki, national road 5 continues as a motorway, {{with the exception of the}} Kallansillat drawbridges in Kuopio. The drawbridges are opened often, as often as 300-400 times every summer. For this reason, building of a new bridge near the old one began in 2010. When the road passes Siilinjärvi, it changes back to the normal two-laned road, next part between Siilinjärvi and Iisalmi is like the normal national road. It runs along the Savonrata railway its whole length to Iisalmi. There is a bypass of Iisalmi town center via east. After Iisalmi, the road continues as a two-lane road due to smaller traffic volumes. From Iisalmi to Kemijärvi via Kajaani, the national road has almost the same traffic volume and same condition. After Kemijärvi, there is less traffic and the road construction does not meet national <b>road</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E

Carlyle has been dubbed the gateway to the Moose Mountain resorts. [...] White Bear Lake, Kenosee Lake and Carlyle Lake are north of Carlyle [...] The land in this area was surveyed by 1881 ... A space of sixty- six feet wide between sections was left for a road allowance, every mile running north and south and every two miles running east and west. [...] The prairie dirt trails were the first used. Walking plows could loosen up earth, then two horse scrapers called fresnoes, could grade the low places. These projects could be undertaken by pioneer settlers who wished to work to help pay homestead taxes. Two horse teams were replaced by fours horse teams and larger scrapers. Crawler tractors eventually replaced horse teams to pull larger scrapers and graders. No. 9 was surveyed in 1929 and graded in 1930-31. These roads were first gravelled in 1930-31 and 1933. This made for safer driving in rainy weather, but very dusty in dry weather. Sometimes these clouds of dust were the cause of accidents on the highways. Next these roads were re-built for oiled surfaces - No. 9 to the lakes in 1956, and south of town in 1964-65....The oiled surface reduced the dust hazard, but kept breaking up under heavy loads...When potash was discovered...better surfacing was requited. So the highway were once again built up to make them wider, and No. 9 got heavy-duty paving to withstand the heavy loads. This was done in 1969-1970... A government road project of 1931 connected White Bear Lake to Fish Lake. Harry Cochrane and his crew began in the south at White Bear Lake, Bill Henderson and his crew began in the north at Fish Lake. [...] The first name of Kenosee Lake was Fish Lake. [...] The Scenic Highway Relief Project was begun traveling south to north west of the present highway. The route was blazed, trees felled, stumps dynamited, and the cleared area ploughed, in order to prepare it for the construction. All this work as soon overgrown with native flora, and the road was never developed between McGurk Lake to the south and Stevens Lake and Hewitt Lake at the north end. [...] About 1952, rural municipal councils realized they had to improve their road system to accommodate heavier loads and faster traffic.... <b>road</b> <b>standards</b> were set by the Government.
