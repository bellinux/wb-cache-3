2500|$|Three {{denominations}} of {{gold bullion}} coins, the [...] "Kijang Emas" [...] (the kijang, {{a species of}} deer, being part of Bank Negara Malaysia's logo) are also issued, at the face value of RM 50, RM 100 and RM 200, weighing ¼ oz, ½ oz and 1 oz respectively. It is minted by the Royal Mint of Malaysia and was launched on 17 July 2001 by Bank Negara Malaysia, making Malaysia the twelfth country to issue its own gold bullion coins. Like other bullion coins issued around the world, the Kijang Emas is primarily used as an investment rather than day-to-day circulation. The purchase and <b>reselling</b> <b>price</b> of Kijang Emas {{is determined by the}} prevailing international gold market price.|$|E
50|$|Captain Train works {{through the}} carriers' own {{reservation}} systems for all searches and transactions; it acts strictly as an intermediary {{between them and}} passengers, and does not hold the tickets which it buys and <b>resells.</b> <b>Prices</b> are those charged by the carriers, with no added service charge; Captain Train receives a commission from the carrier on each ticket sale.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, Labour MP Sharon Hodgson's {{proposal}} that legislation {{be introduced to}} cap <b>resell</b> <b>prices</b> at face value +10% {{was rejected by the}} Department of Culture, Media and Sport. After the company failed to appear before the Culture, Media And Sport select committee of the UK parliament in March 2017 Hodgson, accompanied by fellow committee member Nigel Adams, visited its London Headquarters at 71 Fenchurch Street in July 2017 but the party was turned away.|$|R
50|$|General stores, and {{itinerant}} peddlers, dominated {{in rural}} America until {{the coming of}} the automobile after 1910. Farmers and ranchers depended on general stores that had a limited stock and slow turnover; they made enough profit to stay in operation by selling at high prices. Often farmers would barter butter, cheese, eggs, vegetables or other foods which the merchant would <b>resell.</b> <b>Prices</b> were not marked on each item; instead the customer negotiated a price. Men did most of the shopping, since the main criterion was credit rather than quality of goods. Indeed, most customers shopped on credit, paying off the bill when crops, hogs or cattle were later sold; the owner's ability to judge credit worthiness was vital to his success. The store was often a gathering point for local men to chat, pass around the weekly newspaper, and talk politics.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the dynamic routing of product returns in {{distinguishable}} parallel queues. Several vendors alongside an original equipment manufacturer are available in provision of remanufacturing service. Each has its own queue. The stream of the product returns follow a stochastic process. A central controller is employed to decide to which vendor an incoming product is sent to avoid excessive queues in front of some vendors and idle servers in the others. We develop models and index-based heuristics to support the dynamic routing decisions so as to minimize the overall recovering costs. The product concerned exemplifies a short-life cycle due to, for example, technology advance. Long delay during the remanufacturing process will render a substantial deterioration of <b>reselling</b> <b>prices.</b> Hence, in the paper we contend that the cost incurred for remanufacturing a product should take explicit account {{of the impact of}} long delays in the lead time. Both theoretical and simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the Restless Bandit approach deployed to the dynamic routing of product returns among multiple vendors...|$|R
5000|$|The petitioner, Kiefer-Stewart Company, was an Indiana drug concern {{which does}} a {{wholesale}} liquor business. Respondents, Seagram and Calvert corporations, are affiliated companies that sell liquor in interstate commerce to Indiana wholesalers. Kiefer-Stewart brought this {{action in a}} federal district court for treble damages under the Sherman Act, [...] and [...] The complaint charged that respondents had agreed or conspired to sell liquor only to those Indiana wholesalers who would <b>resell</b> at <b>prices</b> fixed by Seagram and Calvert, and that this agreement deprived Kiefer-Stewart of a continuing supply of liquor, to its great damage.|$|R
50|$|The bank {{provides}} in-kind and in-cash short-term, {{medium and}} long-term agricultural credit to individual farmers, agricultural cooperative societies and agricultural companies. Additionally, it mobilizes {{individual and group}} savings in rural areas. It cashes checks issued by customers and provides guarantees to depositors or borrowers. The bank also subsidizes prices for various agricultural inputs and purchases crops at prices exceeding the prevailing market <b>prices,</b> <b>reselling</b> them to customers at reduced prices. 100% of the Bank’s loan portfolio is allocated to the agricultural sector.|$|R
5000|$|The {{economic}} difficulties that guilds imposed on unmarried women led many {{to enter the}} retail industry. These women were referred to as hucksters, earning a living by buying and selling a variety of edible goods. Without a husband to help them travel, however, hucksters were limited to sales within the town marketplace. Hucksters were regularly accused of <b>reselling</b> goods at <b>prices</b> deceitfully higher than market value. Those accused were referred to as [...] "regraters" [...] and were not highly respected by city officials.|$|R
5000|$|The next case, United States v. Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., made {{it clear}} [...] "that Beech-Nut {{narrowly}} limited Colgate and announced principles which subject to Sherman Act liability the producer who secures his customers' adherence to his resale prices by methods which go beyond the simple refusal to sell to customers who will not resell at stated prices." [...] In Bausch & Lomb, the Court found {{a violation of the}} Sherman Act where the distributor proffered a price-fixing plan and the wholesales joined in [...] "by cooperating in prices, limitation of sales to and approval of retail licensees." [...] The scope of the Colgate doctrine may have been uncertain before Beech-Nut and Bausch & Lomb but those decisions [...] "plainly fashioned its dimensions as meaning no more than that a simple refusal to sell to customers who will not <b>resell</b> at <b>prices</b> suggested by the seller is permissible under the Sherman Act." [...] A combination in violation of the Sherman Act is [...] "organized if the producer secures adherence to his suggested prices by means which go beyond his mere declination to sell to a customer who will not observe his announced policy." ...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{thriving}} community {{of individuals with}} a passion for wearing, collecting, and sometimes reselling sneakers. Â The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the motivations and perspectives of male sneaker collectors. Twelve men participated in semi-structured interviews. Â Research questions included: (1) How do sneaker collectors perceive the experience of sneaker collecting? (2) What makes a shoe collectable? (3) Is sneaker collecting used to represent or explore identity? Most participants were active in sports, especially basketball, and they thought that collecting arose naturally from their sports interests. Respondents cited three primary reasons for collecting a shoe: They collected shoes associated with particular moments in basketball history, shoes with aesthetic qualities they particularly liked, and shoes that would <b>resell</b> for high <b>prices.</b> Sneaker collecting does appear to be a way for these men to voice their interests in fashion, dress, and personal expression...|$|R
5000|$|In Russell Stover Candies v. FTC, the FTC, [...] "in an {{admitted}} {{effort to}} test the viability of Colgate," [...] took the position that an unlawful combination or agreement could be found when a buyer unwillingly submitted to and complied with a supplier's pricing policy {{in order to avoid}} termination. The Eighth Circuit reversed, however, pointing to the statement in Parke Davis that [...] "a simple refusal to sell to customers who will not <b>resell</b> at <b>prices</b> suggested by the seller is permissible under the Sherman Act" [...] although an unlawful [...] "combination is also organized if the producer secures adherence to his suggested prices by means which go beyond his mere declination to sell to a customer who will not observe his announced policy"; the court added that Parke Davis had been found to have gone far [...] "beyond the limits of the Colgate doctrine" [...] by enlisting wholesalers and retailers to adhere to and participate in the price-fixing program. The court said that the FTC has presented a case in which [...] "there are no 'plus factors' to take the case beyond Colgate," [...] so it reversed the Commission. [...] "Despite the FTC's attempt to gut Colgate," [...] however, [...] "it did not choose to argue that Section 5 the FTC Act does not require agreement." [...] Instead, the FTC attempted to find a violation by invoking § 1 of the Sherman Act, including specifically the requirement of a contract,combination, or conspiracy, but it failed to establish that.|$|R
2500|$|Ala ud-Din Khalji changed tax policies, raising {{agriculture}} {{taxes from}} 20% to 50% (payable in grain and agricultural produce), eliminating payments and commissions on taxes collected by local chiefs, banned socialization among his officials {{as well as}} inter-marriage between noble families to help prevent any opposition forming against him, and he cut salaries of officials, poets, and scholars. These tax policies and spending controls strengthened his treasury to pay the keep of his growing army; he also introduced price controls on all agriculture produce and goods in the kingdom, as well as controls on where, how, and by whom these goods could be sold. Markets called [...] "shahana-i-mandi" [...] were created. Muslim merchants were granted exclusive permits and monopoly in these [...] "mandis" [...] to buy and <b>resell</b> at official <b>prices.</b> No one other than these merchants could buy from farmers or sell in cities. Those found violating these [...] "mandi" [...] rules were severely punished, often by mutilation. Taxes collected {{in the form of}} grain were stored in the kingdom's storage. During famines that followed, these granaries ensured sufficient food for the army.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{history of}} the Colgate {{doctrine}} is best understood," [...] the Court said, [...] "by reference to a case which preceded the Colgate decision, Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co. In that case, Dr. Miles entered into contracts with wholesale and retail merchants that required them to resell a medicine at prices that Miles fixed. Park refused to sign the contracts, induced customers of Miles to resell to Park, and then Park sold the medicines at cut prices in violation of Miles's resale-price maintenance program. Miles sued Park for inducing Miles's customers to breach their contracts with him. Citing Coke on Littleton, § 360 and Mitchel v Reynolds, the Court held the restrictive agreements that Miles sought to enforce were invalid at common law and under the Sherman Act as well. In the Colgate case, however, there was no agreement, just a refusal to deal with price cutters. [...] "The Colgate decision distinguished Dr. Miles {{on the ground that}} the Colgate indictment did not charge that company with selling its products to dealers under agreements which obligated the latter not to <b>resell</b> except at <b>prices</b> fixed by the seller.|$|R
50|$|Alauddin Khilji {{taxation}} {{methods and}} increased taxes reduced agriculture output and the Sultanate witnessed massive inflation. In order {{to compensate for}} salaries that he had cut and fixed for Muslim officials and soldiers, Alauddin introduced price controls on all agriculture produce, goods, livestocks and slaves in kingdom, as well as controls on where, how and by whom these could be sold. Markets called shahana-i-mandi were created. Muslim merchants were granted exclusive permits and monopoly in these mandi to buy and <b>resell</b> at official <b>prices.</b> No one other than these merchants could buy from farmers or sell in cities. Alauddin deployed an extensive network of Munhiyans (spies, secret police) who would monitor the mandi and {{had the power to}} seize anyone trying to buy or sell anything at a price different than the official controlled prices. Those found violating these mandi rules were severely punished, such as by cutting out their flesh. Taxes collected in form of seized crops and grains were stored in sultanate's granaries. Over time, farmers quit farming for income and shifted to subsistence farming, the general food supply worsened in north India, shortages increased and Delhi Sultanate witnessed increasingly worse and extended periods of famines. The Sultan banned private storage of food by anyone. Rationing system was introduced by Alauddin as shortages multiplied; however, the nobility and his army were exempt from the per family quota-based food rationing system. The shortages, price controls and rationing system caused starvation deaths of numerous rural people, mostly Hindus. However, during these famines, Khilji's sultanate granaries and wholesale mandi system with price controls ensured sufficient food for his army, court officials and the urban population in Delhi. Price controls instituted by Khilji reduced prices, but also lowered wages to a point where ordinary people did not benefit from the low prices. The price control system collapsed shortly after the death of Alauddin Khalji, with prices of various agriculture products and wages doubling to quadrupling within a few years.|$|R
40|$|Low mineral {{fertiliser}} use received much attention in Africa {{over the last}} decades. As fertiliser sales have exponentially grown in Ethiopia, and evidence exists of a supply that is beyond the demand in the drier northern parts of the country, we investigated the geographical determinants of inorganic fertiliser sales and its resale prices in north Ethiopia. Quantitative data on fertiliser provision and prices {{on the black market}} in 2016 were obtained from official statistics and from key informants in each of the 35 studied districts and in all municipalities of the Raya area. Environmental variables were collected from spatial databases. To promote inorganic fertiliser, agricultural experts use incentives, and also barter the purchase of fertiliser by a farmer against food aid or other advantages from the authorities. The high application rate that is aimed at (200 kg ha(- 1)) contrasts with the dominance of less-responsive soils in the study area, for which inorganic fertiliser application does not result in higher crop yields, or even leads to root burn. The quantitative analysis shows that 40. 7 10 (3) Mg of fertiliser were officially sold in the study area in 2016, which corresponds to 52 kg ha(- 1). This is notably different from the application rate, as reselling widely occurs, at 50 % of the official price for diammonium phosphate (DAP) and 54 % for urea, mostly to users outside the community. By accepting the opportunity offered by agricultural companies and traders, smallholders save themselves from greatei losses. The black market rate is strongly and positively correlated to monthly rainfall at sowing time (July 2016) (R- 2 = 0. 44; n = 31; p < 0. 01). In the four districts with spate irrigation, black market prices for inorganic fertiliser are low (35 % of the official rate) and small quantities are sold officially (32 kg ha(- 1)). This corresponds to the farmers' saying that there "nobody needs inorganic fertiliser since the spate irrigation adds organic and inorganic nutrients yearly". We found similarities to the 'Green Revolution' in Mexico: the forced delivery of high-cost fertiliser, and the <b>reselling</b> at half <b>price</b> in the black market. Inorganic fertilisers are one of the elements that have allowed boosting agricultural production in Ethiopia; our findings indicate however that in the study area, the fertiliser policy needs to be much fine-tuned so that it is led by agronomic needs, rather than by statistics of inorganic fertiliser consumption, that hide complex environmental variability and socio-political relations...|$|R
