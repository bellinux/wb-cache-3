5|$|The station's callsign, NBN, is {{an acronym}} for Newcastle Broadcasting New South Wales. NBN is the only <b>regional</b> <b>station</b> in {{mainland}} Australia to produce a one-hour news bulletin seven days a week. Since 2007, it has been owned by Nine's parent company Nine Entertainment Co. (formerly PBL Media), making it a sister station to its metropolitan counterparts. Prior to 1 July 2016, NBN operated as an independent <b>regional</b> <b>station,</b> and not {{as part of the}} main network, under the name NBN. When Nine switched regional affiliations outside Northern NSW and the Gold Coast, NBN started only using Nine branding.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth is the {{regional}} television centre of BBC South West. A team of journalists are headquartered at Plymouth for the ITV West Country <b>regional</b> <b>station,</b> after a merger with ITV West forced ITV Westcountry to close on 16 February 2009. The main local newspapers serving Plymouth are The Herald and Western Morning News with Radio Plymouth, BBC Radio Devon, Heart South West, and Pirate FM being the local radio stations {{with the most}} listeners.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 2006, NBN {{adopted a}} new logo and on air graphics, {{in line with}} Nine's new logo. However, the news {{department}} did not update its graphics until 15 March. During April 2007, SP Telemedia {{announced that it would}} consider selling NBN Television, and had received at least two bids, one each from WIN Corporation and PBL Media. On 9 May 2007, PBL Media's (now Nine Entertainment Co.) A$250 million bid became final, winning the sale. However, upon acquiring NBN, PBL did not fold it into the main Nine Network, but continued to operate it as a <b>regional</b> <b>station.</b> The purchase also secured permanent status of supplying Nine's content to the station's entire coverage area, sparing any future affiliation switches (particularly the 2016 Australian television shakeup involving Southern Cross Austereo and WIN Corporation).|$|E
50|$|New Zealand also {{operates}} several <b>regional</b> television <b>stations,</b> {{which are}} only available in individual markets. The <b>regional</b> <b>stations</b> will typically air a local news programme, produce some shows in-house and cover local sports events; {{the majority of}} programming on the <b>regional</b> <b>stations</b> will be imported from various sources.|$|R
50|$|Some {{commercial}} broadcasters have a {{call sign}} that operates over multiple areas, whereas others may only serve a single area. This {{is due to}} historical ownership of <b>regional</b> <b>stations.</b> Nevertheless, most <b>regional</b> <b>stations</b> are now affiliated with the major metropolitan networks.|$|R

5|$|All other {{commercial}} stations have 1080i high definition services which, since 2015, simulcast their main channel from standard definition. Prior to this, HD broadcasts are shown as a multichannel providing some differing content {{from the main}} SD channel. For instance, ABC Television has a 720p high definition service, which used to run as ABC-HD (simulcasting ABC1), but now operates as ABC News 24. Currently, SBS Television, the Nine Network and its <b>regional</b> <b>station</b> NBN Television, Network Ten, and WIN Television broadcast a 1080i high definition simulcast of their respective main channel. The Seven Network also has a relaunched HD channel, yet it isn't implemented as the primary channel's HD simulcast across all metropolitan stations to allow the games of the Australian Football League be broadcast in HD. Only the Melbourne and Adelaide stations received its channel on its purpose; Sydney, Perth and Brisbane stations, meanwhile, continues to air digital multichannel 7mate in high definition through 7HD, with the former downgraded to standard definition by default.|$|E

25|$|Commercial {{television}} {{is dominated by}} three major metropolitan-based networks, the Seven Network and Network Ten, which own stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, and the Nine Network which owns stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Darwin with affiliates in Adelaide and Perth. In addition to its metropolitan assets, Seven also owns <b>regional</b> <b>station</b> Seven Queensland.|$|E
25|$|News {{and current}} affairs, {{particularly}} on commercial television, grew significantly – the Nine Network's A Current Affair, hosted by Mike Willesee began in November 1971, while 60 Minutes, {{on the same}} network, began in 1979. In March 1972, Brisbane station BTQ-7 claimed the first one-hour newscast in Australia. The one-hour newscast format was also later adopted by <b>regional</b> <b>station</b> NBN, Newcastle, and capital city television stations TEN-10 Sydney and ATV-0 Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|Jay Gould {{spoke to}} many {{community}} organizations, relating {{the history of}} WOWO. Initially, the leading station in Detroit (WJR), Chicago (WLS), and Cincinnati (WLW) all competed for farmer listeners with agricultural reports. WOWO, almost equidistant between those three stations eventually captured that demographic, with the other three stations focusing on their urban and suburban areas. This benefitted WOWO as national advertisers saw WOWO as a <b>regional</b> <b>station</b> that would reach well into the backyards of those larger metropolises.|$|E

500|$|In 1963, NBN won the Logie Award for Enterprising Programming (which {{was only}} for country stations), and another Outstanding Contribution by a <b>Regional</b> <b>Station</b> award in 1978. NBN {{purchased}} the Romper Room franchise from Fremantle International in 1967, which broadcast for over three decades. The original hostess was Miss Anne, followed by Miss Lyn, Miss Pauline and finally, Miss Kim who hosted the program until its demise due to 'political correctness'. (For example, a favourite feature called 'bounce-the-ball' was deemed inappropriate because not all children could bounce a ball). At first the 'Miss's' were assisted by NBN's station mascot, Buttons the Cat, who underwent a number of incarnations as its costume aged and became outdated. Later, Buttons was retired, being replaced by Humphrey B. Bear (as NBN had gained {{the rights to the}} character through their purchase of Southern Television Corporation), [...] A Local suited character was then determined to be more suitable for a regional television station and the concept of Big Dog was created, the character and suit were created in Wyong on the NSW Central Coast and Big Dog came into being.|$|E

2500|$|From 2010, the Seven Network {{began to}} {{implement}} the tactic of creating a 5 to 20-minute delay in the scheduled start time of non-live programming after 7:30PM {{in an attempt to}} minimise viewer channel surfing between prime-time shows. [...] This is done by increasing the duration of the commercial breaks and then decreasing them once the prime-time period is over. [...] This tactic not only disrupts viewer recordings of the shows, but has a dramatic effect on their regional affiliates such as Prime and Southern Cross who must adapt their inserted commercials breaks as the live play-out from Seven's Melbourne facility occurs which can cause either both the <b>regional</b> <b>station</b> identification and the Seven identification being displayed with a possible black screen between them or the start of a program being missed entirely by the regional break overlapping.|$|E

In 1977 {{he was in charge}} of their In Concert productions, beginning with one featuring Barbara Dickson on 7 February 1977. He made Devine Country, a series featuring Scotland's major Country & Western star, Sydney Devine. [...] He also directed the popular music series, Thingamajig. By 1979, he was making documentaries at home and abroad and in 1980 began adding drama to his output. It was around this time that [...] "ITV wanted a daytime soap from Scotland but had no interest in Garnock Way, the weekly serial that STV made for local consumption", and so Duncan was set to work on Take the High Road (initially named The Glendhu Factor and then High Road – Low Road, finally settling on the title by which it was known until 1994, when it changed to just High Road).|$|E
