50|$|In the {{remainder}} of the 1960s, Teledyne acquired some 90 more companies. A number of these businesses were in consumer products, such as Water Pik, Acoustic Research with high-fidelity speakers, and Olson Electronics that operated retail stores across America. Packard Bell had both consumer and government sales in computers and television receivers. A number of electronic product lines and smaller acquisitions were consolidated in Teledyne Electronics and Teledyne Microelectronic Technologies. Two acquired firms, Geophysical Exploration and Geotronics, brought Teledyne into off-shore drilling and earth-science instrumentation fields. Twenty-one acquired companies were in the metals business, including Wah Chang and Cast Products, and this led to the acquisition of firms producing industrial machines and machine tools. Other diverse acquisitions included Monarch Rubber, Sewart Seacraft, Isotopes, <b>Radar</b> <b>Relays,</b> and Getz Dental.|$|R

As with semi-active homing missiles, the ground-based radar illuminates the target with radar energy {{which is then}} reflected off the target and detected by the missile. However, unlike a SARH missile, the missile itself does not compute interception with this information. Instead, data from the <b>radar</b> returns is <b>relayed</b> {{back to the ground}} station via a data link which also serves for passing the guidance commands to the missile.|$|R
2500|$|The {{development}} of centimeter radar during World War 2 {{and the first}} high power microwave tubes, the klystron (1938) and cavity magnetron (1940), resulted in the first widespread use of waveguide. [...] Standard waveguide [...] "plumbing" [...] components were manufactured, with flanges on the end which could be bolted together.

Northrop Grumman were responsible for the integration of the various electro-optical/infrared, signals intelligence, <b>radar</b> and communications <b>relay</b> payloads onto the airship.|$|R
50|$|Pointing in a {{specific}} direction is necessary for Earth observation, orbital maneuvers, maximizing solar power, and some scientific instruments. Directional pointing accuracy {{can be achieved by}} sensing Earth and its horizon, the Sun, or specific stars. Sinclair Interplanetary's SS-411 sun sensor and ST-16 star tracker both have applications for CubeSats and have flight heritage. Pumpkin's Colony I Bus uses an aerodynamic wing for passive attitude stabilization. Determination of a CubeSat's location can be done through the use of on-board GPS, which is relatively expensive for a CubeSat, or by <b>relaying</b> <b>radar</b> tracking data to the craft from Earth-based tracking systems.|$|R
50|$|A {{microwave}} cavity acts similarly to a resonant circuit with extremely low loss at its frequency of operation, resulting in quality factors (Q factors) {{up to the}} order of 106, compared to 102 for circuits made with separate inductors and capacitors at the same frequency. They are used in place of resonant circuits at microwave frequencies, since at these frequencies discrete resonant circuits cannot be built because the values of inductance and capacitance needed are too low. They are used in oscillators and transmitters to create microwave signals, and as filters to separate a signal at a given frequency from other signals, in equipment such as <b>radar</b> equipment, microwave <b>relay</b> stations, satellite communications, and microwave ovens.|$|R

50|$|Inflight - {{which the}} pilots call “Radio”, activates, cancels, and alters VFR flight plans. They take {{position}} reports and changes of destination for both {{civilian and military}} aircraft. They relay IFR and SVFR clearances to aircraft on the ground either by phone or through their frequencies {{when there is no}} direct method of communication with the air traffic control facility governing the area. At border stations, Radio also takes information from aircraft crossing into the U.S., and issues squawk codes to VFR aircraft which identify them to Homeland Security’s <b>radar.</b> They <b>relay</b> information on forest fires to the U.S. Forest Service. Inflight monitors VHF and UHF frequencies, VOR voices, and emergency frequencies - from 60 to 100 different frequencies per area. The United States FSS radio frequencies are published in several FAA publications, including airport facility directories (AFD), VFR sectional maps, and IFR low and high altitude en route charts. When pilots have an inflight emergency, such as being lost, having smoke in the cockpit, or having low fuel and needing directions to the nearest airport with fuel, they call flight service for assistance.|$|R

40|$|TechCon 2017 (CRUSER) Presented by Dr. Sean Kragelund: NPS Mechanical & Aerospace Eng. Includes slidesNetworked {{autonomous}} vehicles {{have great}} potential {{in a wide}} range of littoral sensing applications, including mine countermeasures (MCM), undersea warfare (USW), and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Motion planning algorithms which consider the capabilities and limitations of individual vehicle/sensor configurations are a key enabler for optimal employment of dissimilar vehicles to accomplish a given sensing objective. Optimal control is a model-based framework for solving motion planning problems with multiple vehicles, dynamic constraints, and complex performance objectives; although they usually require numerical solutions and deterministic formulations. Recent research at NPS, however, has produced a general mathematical and computational framework for numerically solving these problems, even in the face of parameter uncertainty: Generalized Optimal Control (GenOC). GenOC has been used to solve complex motion planning problems with multi-agent interactions, in applications ranging from optimal search to swarm defense and target herding behaviors. This presentation describes recent CRUSER supported research which utilized the GenOC framework to generate optimal search trajectories for multiple, dissimilar vehicles conducting MCM with different sonar systems. The resulting trajectories have been shown to outperform traditional lawnmower coverage patterns when detecting mines under time or resource constraints. Moreover, the ability to rapidly solve optimal search problems in this framework can establish performance benchmarks and provide important insights into optimal sensor and vehicle employment strategies. These capabilities are being developed into an experimental mission planning and analysis tool for the MCM community. We will also highlight how GenOC will be used to generate optimal vehicle trajectories for aerial, surface, and underwater vehicles during the upcoming CRUSER/JIFX multi-threaded experiment (MTX) at San Clemente Island in August, 2017. ScanEagle UAV trajectories will be devised to provide persistent aerial surveillance and mesh network connectivity in support of blue team operations, while also guarding against potential red team incursions. Meanwhile, SeaFox USV trajectories will implement search patterns to detect surface threats with <b>radar,</b> while <b>relaying</b> communications between ScanEagle aircraft and REMUS UUVs executing optimal sonar search patterns.

40|$|The ship on the {{opposite}} page is a U. S. Steel Corporation tanker cruising through the ice-covered waters of the Great Lakes {{in the dead of}} winter. The ship's crew is able to navigate safely by plotting courses through open water or thin ice, a technique made possible by a multi-agency technology demonstration program in which NASA is a leading participant. Traditionally, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway System is closed to shipping for more than three months of winter season because of ice blockage, particularly fluctuations in the thickness and location of ice cover due to storms, wind, currents and variable temperatures. Shippers have long sought a system of navigation that would allow year-round operation on the Lakes and produce enormous economic and fuel conservation benefits. Interrupted operations require that industrial firms stockpile materials to carry them through the impassable months, which is costly. Alternatively, they must haul cargos by more expensive overland transportation. Studies estimate the economic benefits of year-round Great Lakes shipping in {{the hundreds of millions of}} dollars annually and fuel consumption savings in the tens of millions of gallons. Under Project Icewarn, NASA, the U. S. Coast Guard and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration collaborated in development and demonstration of a system that permits safe year-round operations. It employs airborne <b>radars,</b> satellite communications <b>relay</b> and facsimile transmission to provide shippers and ships' masters up-to-date ice charts. Lewis Research Center contributed an accurate methods of measuring ice thickness by means of a special "short-pulse" type of radar. In a three-year demonstration program, Coast Guard aircraft equipped with Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) flew over the Great Lakes three or four times a week. The SLAR, which can penetrate clouds, provided large area readings of the type and distribution of ice cover. The information was supplemented by short-pulse radar measurements of ice thickness. The <b>radar</b> data was <b>relayed</b> by a NOAA satellite to a ground station where NOAA analyzed it and created picture maps, such as the one shown at lower left, showing where icebreakers can cut paths easily or where shipping can move through thin ice without the aid of icebreakers. The ice charts were then relayed directly to the wheelhouses of ships operating on the Lakes. Following up the success of the Great Lakes program, the icewarn team applied its system in another demonstration, this one a similarly successful application designed to aid Arctic coast shipping along the Alaskan North Slope. Further improvement of the ice-monitoring system is planned. Although aircraft-mounted radar is effective, satellites could provide more frequent data. After the launch this year of Seasat, an ocean-monitoring satellite, NASA will conduct tests to determine the ice-mapping capability and accuracy of satellite radar images...|$|R
40|$|Dataflow {{analyses}} are {{a critical part}} of many optimizing compilers as well as bug-finding and program-understanding tools. However, many dataflow {{analyses are}} not designed for concurrent programs. Dataflow analyses for concurrent programs differ from their single-threaded counterparts in that they must account for shared memory locations being overwritten by concurrent threads. Existing dataflow analysis techniques for concurrent programs typically fall at either end of a spectrum: at one end, the analysis conservatively kills facts about all data that might possibly be shared by multiple threads; at the other end, a precise thread-interleaving analysis determines which data may be shared, and thus which dataflow facts must be invalidated. The former approach can suffer from imprecision, whereas the latter does not scale. This dissertation presents a framework called RADAR, which automatically converts a dataflow analysis for sequential programs into one that is correct for concurrent programs. With RADAR, the vast body of work in designing dataflow analyses for sequential programs can be reused in the concurrent setting. RADAR uses a race detection engine to kill the dataflow facts [...] generated and propagated by the sequential analysis [...] that become invalid due to concurrent writes. This approach of factoring all reasoning about concurrency into a race detection engine yields two benefits. First, to obtain analyses for code using new concurrency constructs, {{there is no need to}} update each individual analysis; instead, one need only design a suitable race detection engine for the constructs. Second, it gives analysis designers an easy way to tune the scalability and precision of the overall analysis by only modifying the race detection engine or swapping in a different one. This dissertation describes the RADAR framework and its implementation using a race detection engine called RELAY. RELAY is designed to be a push-button solution and is designed to analyze independent portions of programs in parallel. Combined with <b>RELAY,</b> <b>RADAR</b> is capable of analyzing large C programs including the Apache web server and a subset of the Linux kernel in a reasonable time budget. We compare the results of RADAR to reasonable upper and lower bounds, and show that it is effective in generating concurrent versions of a null-pointer dereference analysis as well as several traditional compiler-oriented dataflow analyse...|$|R
40|$|Exposition to {{microwave}} radiation (MW) from mobile phones, satellite communi-cations, radio <b>relays,</b> <b>radars</b> and microwave devices in medicine induce disturbances in different organ systems. It {{has been shown}} that MW from mobile phones induce increasing of oxidative stress and apoptosis of neurons with impairment of blood brain barrier, disturbances of memory and space orientation. Citrulline and nitric oxide -NO are products of L-arginine by NO sintase-NOS. L-ornithine and polyamines are products of L-arginine by arginase. Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) competitive inhibits NOS and exerts neuroprotective effects. The aim of this investigation was to determine the arginase, PAO and DAO activity, concentration of citrulline, as well as the effects of L-NAME on arginine and polyamine metabolism in brain tissue of rats exposed to MW. Four groups of Wistar rats were investigated during 60 days: I-control-sham exposed, II (L-NAME) -rats treated with L-NAME (5 mg/kg b. w. i. p.), III (MW) -rats exposed to MW (4 h/day), IV (MW + L-NAME). The source of MW was mobile test telephone. Decreasing activity of arginase (0. 19 ± 0. 04 vs. 0. 25 ± 0. 05 mmol/mg prot; p< 0. 01) and increasing of citrulline concentration (10. 34 ± 0. 49 vs. 7. 83 ± 0. 41 mmol/mg prot; p< 0. 001) were registered in the brain of MW exposed rats compared to controls. In L-NAME group there was a decrease of citrulline level (p< 0. 05), and increase in arginase activity (p< 0. 05) compared to controls. In the brain of exposed rats, the activity of PAO was significantly increased, while the activity of DAO was significantly increased vs. controls (1. 12 ± 0. 10 vs. 0. 79 ± 0. 09 U/mg prot; p< 0. 001 and 0. 51 ± 0. 06 vs. 0. 65 ± 0. 06 U/mg prot; p< 0. 05, prospectively). In MW+L-NAME group we registered increasing of DAO activity (0. 61 ± 0. 04 vs. 0. 51 ± 0. 06 U/mg prot; p< 0. 05) in the brain tissue compared with MW group.
