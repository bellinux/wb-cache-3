Through the testing verification of physical mechanisms, the feasibility <b>for</b> the <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> proposed by this research is conducted. It can avoid current shorting when dead jamming happens. Also, the detection circuits relevant to the detection of motor current feedback can be saved to reduce systematical circuit maintenance and manufacture <b>torque</b> <b>limiters</b> with long life expectancy, higher stability and low cost...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse the effectiveness of the surgical <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> during operative use. The study also investigates the potential differences in torque between hand and drill-based screw insertion into locking plates using a standardised <b>torque</b> <b>limiter.</b> Methods: <b>Torque</b> <b>for</b> both hand and power screw insertion was measured through a load cell, registering 6. 66 points per second. This was performed in a controlled environment using synthetic bone, a locking plate and locking screws to simulate plate fixation. Screws were inserted by hand and by drill with torque values measured. Results: The surgical <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> (1. 5 Nm) was effective as the highest recorded reading in the study was 1. 409 Nm. Comparatively, there is a statistically significant difference between screw insertion methods. <b>Torque</b> produced <b>for</b> manually driven screw insertion into locking plates was 1. 289 Nm (95 % CI 1. 269 – 1. 308) with drill-powered screw insertion at 0. 740 Nm (95 % CI 0. 723 – 0. 757). Conclusions: The surgical <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> proved to be effective as per product specifications. Screws inserted under power produce significantly less torque when compared to manual insertion by hand. This is likely related to the mechanism of the <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> when being used at higher speeds for which it was designed. We conclude that screws may be inserted using power to the plate with the addition of a <b>torque</b> <b>limiter.</b> It is recommended that all screws inserted by drill be hand tightened to achieve adequate torque values.

40|$|Vacuolar type rotary H+-ATPases (VoV 1) couple ATP synthesis/hydrolysis by V 1 with proton {{translocation}} by Vo via {{rotation of}} a central rotor apparatus composed of the V 1 -DF rotor shaft, a socket-like Vo-C (eukaryotic Vo-d) and the hydrophobic rotor ring. Reconstitution experiments using subcomplexes revealed a weak binding affinity of V 1 -DF to Vo-C {{despite the fact that}} torque needs to be transmitted between V 1 -DF and Vo-C for the tight energy coupling between V 1 and Vo. Mutation of a short helix at the tip of V 1 -DF caused intramolecular uncoupling of VoV 1, suggesting that proper fitting of the short helix of V 1 -D into the socket of Vo-C is required for tight energy coupling between V 1 and Vo. To account for the apparently contradictory properties of the interaction between V 1 -DF and Vo-C (weak binding affinity but strict <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>torque</b> transmission), we propose a model in which the relationship between V 1 -DF and Vo-C corresponds to that between a slotted screwdriver and a head of slotted screw.

This motor {{is characteristic of}} electrical/mechanical hybrid 4 -redundancy by securing two stators along with two rotors on the same shaft. Each stator contains two sets of windings embedded in separated slots. Furthermore, compared to the scheme of two electrical dual-redundancy BLDCMs linked by a mechanical transmission, the proposed motor has lower volume and lighter weight, eliminates the nonlinearity caused by the gap of the mechanical transmission, moderates the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> the <b>torque</b> balance between redundancies and reduces the cogging torque by shifting the magnets. Both magnetic circuit calculation and the finite element analysis (FEA) of the electromagnetic field are conducted to optimize the design process. A prototype motor has been produced and tested.

Moreover, the position frequency response of the prototype in the DDA's unloaded situation has also demonstrated the fulfillment of desired dynamic characteristics...|$|R

40|$|A {{need for}} {{improvement}} in minimally invasive surgical techniques is well documented. A method of achieving this improvement {{is through the}} development of a tetherless micro-robot capable of conducting medical procedures in vivo. Such a device could circumvent many of the problems associated with current minimally invasive procedures, and ultimately, may carry out procedures previously impossible and open up new areas of treatment. A key obstacle that must be overcome in the development of such a device is the realisation of a motor capable of acting as the drive system. Such a motor needs to be approximately 200 um in diameter, produce a start-up torque in excess of 15 nNm/mm^ 2, and produce an output power of more than 65 uW/mm^ 2. Existing micro-motors have separately met the geometric or performance requirements, but never both. In this thesis, we report a design methodology that results in a piezoelectric ultrasonic resonant micro-motor that, for the first time, effectively meets these requirements. The design methodology of the motor uses the piezoelectric element as a vibration generator, rather than {{as an integral part of}} the stator design. This simplifies the design, resulting in a reduction in size compared with existing micro-motor designs. The application of this methodology requires a stator design that can produce an elliptical stator tip motion from a single excitation source through resonant frequency matching. The design of such a stator is achieved {{through the development of}} three novel modelling techniques, which facilitate an understanding of how the system geometric parameters affect the resonant frequencies of interest, and affect the generation of the desired elliptical stator tip motion. The resulting motor has a stator dimension of 241 um and an overall diameter of 400 um, the larger dimension resulting from the commercial availability of magnetic elements. The peak measured start-up torque was 230. 4 nNm/mm^ 2, with a peak output power of 72. 4 uW/mm^ 2. This exceeded the <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>torque</b> and power to drive a tetherless micro-robot by 15 -times and 10 %, respectively. By overcoming the challenge of the drive system design, this work has opened up the opportunity to progress to the next stage of research in in vivo micro-robotics, full prototype development...|$|R

30|$|Another {{reflection}} {{from the}} first and final parts is that the simulated vehicle accelerates more quickly than the real one. This is mostly because of the vehicle model: the real vehicle has an active <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> when running unladen to protect the engine and transmission from damage, and the gearshifts are not instantaneous but come with a power disruption. Neither of these effects have been modelled in the vehicle. Recall that the OC-format does not stipulate acceleration in any way.|$|R
50|$|Many {{cordless}} drills incorporate {{this type}} of <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> in a planetary gearset. It may {{be a part of}} an assembly of multiple gearsets used to primarily reduce speed and multiply torque as well as perform ratio changes. The <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> is typically the last gearset in the transmission. It uses the planet carrier as the input with the sun gear as the output, and the annulus normally locked. A series of ball detents act on the annulus to lock it, allowing power to be transmitted from the planet carrier to the sun gear. When the torque transmitted through the gearset reaches a determinate amount, the torque acting on the annulus causes it to unlock from its ball detents and freely rotate, causing power to be diverted from the load on the sun gear to the annulus and thereby stalling the output until torque is reduced to an amount where the ball detents can lock the annulus again. This system equally limits torque in both directions of rotation and also works with the sun gear as the input. The compression of the ball detents (and therefore the amount of torque at which the limiter is utilized) is typically adjusted by means of a rotating collar accessible to the user which is indexed and held in place with its own separate ball detents.|$|R
