5|$|A battery {{electric}} vehicle (BEV) uses chemical energy stored in <b>rechargeable</b> battery packs as its only source for propulsion. BEVs use electric motors and motor controllers instead of internal combustion engines (ICEs) for propulsion.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 20th century, lithium {{became an}} {{important}} component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are <b>rechargeable</b> and have a high energy density, {{should not be confused with}} lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode. Other <b>rechargeable</b> batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.|$|E
5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle with <b>rechargeable</b> battery packs {{that can be}} charged from the electric grid, and the electricity stored on board drives or contributes to drive the wheels for propulsion. Plug-in {{electric vehicle}}s are also {{sometimes referred to as}} grid-enabled vehicles (GEV) and also as electrically chargeable vehicles.|$|E
5|$|A second {{demonstration}} ran between 15 December 2009 and February 2010 at the Waterways Visitor Centre in Dublin, and was streamed via Steorn's website. The demonstration was of {{a device}} powered by a <b>rechargeable</b> battery. Steorn said that the device produced more energy than it consumed and recharged the battery. No substantive details of the technology were revealed and no independent evidence of Steorn's claim was provided.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the most}} notable {{resident}} of Low Fell was Sir Joseph Swan. Swan, most famous as {{the inventor of the}} incandescent lightbulb (though also instrumental in improvements to photographic film and <b>rechargeable</b> batteries), lived at Underhill, 99 Kells Lane in Low Fell between 1869 and 1883.|$|E
5|$|Electrochemistry {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of electricity. From the initial invention of the Voltaic pile, electrochemical cells have evolved into the many different types of batteries, electroplating and electrolysis cells. Aluminium is produced in vast quantities this way, and many portable devices are electrically powered using <b>rechargeable</b> cells.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, 86% of cadmium {{was used}} in batteries, {{predominantly}} in <b>rechargeable</b> nickel-cadmium batteries. Nickel-cadmium cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2V. The cell consists of a positive nickel hydroxide electrode and a negative cadmium electrode plate separated by an alkaline electrolyte (potassium hydroxide). The European Union put a limit on cadmium in electronics in 2004 of 0.01%, with some exceptions, and reduced the limit on cadmium content to 0.002%.|$|E
5|$|Ni(IV) {{is present}} in the mixed oxide , while Ni(III) {{is present in}} nickel(III) oxide, which is used as the cathode in many <b>rechargeable</b> batteries, {{including}} nickel-cadmium, nickel-iron, nickel hydrogen, and nickel-metal hydride, and used by certain manufacturers in Li-ion batteries. Ni(IV) remains a rare oxidation state of nickel and very few compounds are known to date.|$|E
5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle {{that can be}} recharged from an external source of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity stored in the <b>rechargeable</b> battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subset of {{electric vehicle}}s that includes all-electric or battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. In China, plug-in electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).|$|E
5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid {{electric vehicle}} with <b>rechargeable</b> batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional {{hybrid electric vehicle}} and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E
5|$|Battery: Shorter {{than the}} DS Lite, {{regardless}} of brightness setting; for example, the DSi has a battery life of 9–14 {{hours on the}} lowest brightness setting, compared to the 15–19 hours of the DS Lite on the same setting. The battery is an 840mAh internal <b>rechargeable,</b> compared to 1000mAh for the DS Lite, and has an optimal lifespan of approximately 500 cycles; after this point, it may {{be replaced by the}} user.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency {{is charged}} with {{regulating}} and managing mercury contamination. Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Additionally, the Mercury-Containing and <b>Rechargeable</b> Battery Management Act, passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries. North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995.|$|E
5|$|MRO has two <b>rechargeable</b> nickel-hydrogen {{batteries}} used {{to power}} the spacecraft {{when it is not}} facing the Sun. Each battery has an energy storage capacity of 50ampere-hours (180kC). The full range of the batteries cannot be used due to voltage constraints on the spacecraft, but allows the operators to extend the battery life—a valuable capability, given that battery drain {{is one of the most}} common causes of long-term satellite failure. Planners anticipate that only 40% of the batteries' capacities will be required during the lifetime of the spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|This iPad uses an {{internal}} <b>rechargeable</b> lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery that {{can hold a}} charge of 11,560mAh. The batteries are made in Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology (40%). The iPad {{is designed to be}} charged with a relatively high current of 2amps using the included 12W USB power adapter and Lightning connector. While it can be charged by an older USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500milliamps (0.5amps). As a result, if the iPad is in use while powered by a computer, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities. Apple claims that the battery can provide up to 10hours of video, audio playback, or web surfing on Wi-Fi, 9hours of web surfing over a cellular connection, or one month on standby. Like any <b>rechargeable</b> battery, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's battery is not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee. During the battery replacement process, user data is not preserved/transferred, and repaired or refurbished units come with a new case. The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{claims that}} the battery can provide up to 10hours of video, 140hours of audio playback, or one month on standby; people say the battery lasts about 8hours doing normal tasks. Like any <b>rechargeable</b> battery, the iPad's battery loses {{capacity}} over time. However, the iPad's battery is not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee of US$99 plus $6.95 shipping. User data is not preserved/transferred. The refurbished unit comes with a new case. The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{claims that}} the battery for both generations of iPad can provide up to 10 hours of video, 140 hours of audio playback, or one month on standby. Like any <b>rechargeable</b> battery technology, the iPad's battery loses {{capacity}} over time, but is not designed to be user-replaceable. In a program similar to the battery-replacement program for the iPod and the original iPhone, Apple will replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished iPad for a fee of US$99 plus $6.95 shipping. As a different unit is supplied, user data is not preserved. The refurbished unit {{will have a new}} case. The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Fares are AR$7.50 per {{trip on the}} Subte, {{though these}} can be as low as AR$4.50 per trip {{depending}} on how many trips are made per month, while the Premetro has a flat rate of AR$1.50. While tokens {{have been used in}} the past, at present, riders use contactless cards called SUBE, which are <b>rechargeable</b> with multiple forms of payment. Previously, single or multi-use paper cards with a magnetic strip (called Subtepass) were used, however, these were phased out of the system in May 2016, opting instead only to use the digital cards, with the exception of some retired, disabled and student cards. Trains run from 05:00 until 23:00, every 3–4minutes, for all lines except Line H which has a frequency of around 6minutes. Under modernisation plans commenced in 2013, service frequencies are set to increase to an average of one train every 2:20 by 2019.|$|E
5|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} {{may suffer}} thermal runaway and cell rupture if overheated or overcharged, and {{in extreme cases}} {{this can lead to}} combustion. To reduce these risks, lithium-ion battery packs contain fail-safe circuitry that shuts down the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range. When handled improperly, or if manufactured defectively, some <b>rechargeable</b> batteries can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Especially prone to thermal runaway are lithium-ion batteries. Reports of exploding cellphones have been reported in newspapers. In 2006, batteries from Apple, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell and other notebook manufacturers were recalled because of fire and explosions. Also, during the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's first year of service, at least four aircraft suffered from electrical system problems stemming from its lithium-ion batteries, resulting in the whole Dreamliner fleet being voluntarily grounded in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|Nickel {{is used in}} many {{specific}} and recognizable industrial and consumer products, including stainless steel, alnico magnets, coinage, <b>rechargeable</b> batteries, electric guitar strings, microphone capsules, plating on plumbing fixtures, and special alloys such as permalloy, elinvar, and invar. It is used for plating and as a green tint in glass. Nickel is preeminently an alloy metal, and its chief use is in nickel steels and nickel cast irons, in which it typically increases the tensile strength, toughness, and elastic limit. It is widely used in many other alloys, including nickel brasses and bronzes and alloys with copper, chromium, aluminium, lead, cobalt, silver, and gold (Inconel, Incoloy, Monel, Nimonic).|$|E
5|$|Off-grid PV {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} used <b>rechargeable</b> batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The iPad 2 has a 25W·h <b>rechargeable</b> {{lithium-ion}} polymer battery {{that lasts}} 10 hours, like the original iPad. It is charged via USB or included 10 W, 2 A power adapter. The battery is 2.5mm thick, 59% smaller than the original and has three cells instead of two. The improvements allowed the injection-molded plastic support frame to be omitted. The 10 W USB power adapter provides 4x {{the power of a}} conventional USB port. The tablet has an audio frequency response of 20 Hz to 20kHz. Without third-party software it can play the following audio formats: HE-AAC, AAC, Protected AAC, MP3, MP3 VBR, Audible formats (2, 3, 4, AEA, AAX, and AAX+), ALAC, AIFF, and WAV.|$|E
5|$|The iPad uses an {{internal}} <b>rechargeable</b> lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery. The batteries {{are made in}} Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology. The iPad {{is designed to be}} charged with a high current of 2 amperes using the included 10 W USB power adapter and USB cord with a USB connector at one end and a 30-pin dock connector at the other end. While it can be charged by a standard USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500 milliamperes (0.5 amps). As a result, if the iPad is running while powered by a normal USB computer port, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer Apple computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities.|$|E

5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other <b>rechargeable</b> batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Incredible Hulk joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut carbon {{emissions}} and waste created during filming. Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, {{was a popular}} environmental analogy, and Norton himself was an environmentalist. Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with low sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced yellow pine instead of lauan for the sets, and also used zero-or low-VOC paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used <b>rechargeable</b> batteries. The Incredible Hulk became the first blockbuster film to receive the Environmental Media Association's Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{locations}} {{reflect the}} dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena, such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and unexplained noises are present, and, {{for the most}} part, the player has to rely on their lighter and <b>rechargeable</b> flashlight to navigate the darkness. Locations will often have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map or objective marker, leaving the player to try finding their objectives with only a compass. The surface is more lethal than the metro system. Featuring a day-night cycle, and a dynamic weather system, these sections are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times because of the toxic air. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask. These last several minutes each, and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. Players are also tasked to wipe off the dirt and blood splatter that collects on the gas mask. There is no head up display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail — rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The watch also serves to indicate to a player {{if they have been}} exposed to enemy attention. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammunition and they have to reload. Instead of head up display the game makes use of audio and visual cues to present information to players.|$|E
25|$|Many {{types of}} {{batteries}} employ toxic {{materials such as}} lead, mercury, and cadmium as an electrode or electrolyte. When each battery reaches end of life it must be disposed of to prevent environmental damage. Batteries are one form of electronic waste (e-waste). E-waste recycling services recover toxic substances, which can then be used for new batteries. Of the nearly three billion batteries purchased annually in the United States, about 179,000 tons end up in landfills across the country. In the United States, the Mercury-Containing and <b>Rechargeable</b> Battery Management Act of 1996 banned the sale of mercury-containing batteries, enacted uniform labeling requirements for <b>rechargeable</b> batteries and required that <b>rechargeable</b> batteries be easily removable. California and New York City prohibit the disposal of <b>rechargeable</b> batteries in solid waste, and along with Maine require recycling of cell phones. The <b>rechargeable</b> battery industry operates nationwide recycling programs in the United States and Canada, with dropoff points at local retailers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rechargeable</b> {{energy storage}} systems, such as battery or ultracapacitor-powered mining locomotives.|$|E
25|$|Secondary batteries, {{also known}} as {{secondary}} cells, or <b>rechargeable</b> batteries, must be charged before first use; they are usually assembled with active materials in the discharged state. <b>Rechargeable</b> batteries are (re)charged by applying electric current, which reverses the chemical reactions that occur during discharge/use. Devices to supply the appropriate current are called chargers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rechargeable</b> flow {{batteries}} {{can serve}} as a large capacity, rapid-response storage medium.|$|E
25|$|The lights used by most halogen <b>rechargeable</b> {{systems are}} cheap, bright but fairly simple: they project a cone of light (wide and narrow beam options are available) {{which is good}} for {{off-road}} use but not ideal for road use as it can dazzle oncoming road users. This is why <b>rechargeable</b> halogen lights do not meet legal requirements in some jurisdictions.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>rechargeable</b> systems offer a {{headlamp}} option powered {{from the}} main battery pack.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{high-power}} flashlights with <b>rechargeable</b> lithium-ion batteries. Although not {{specifically designed for}} bicycle use, these are {{a viable alternative to}} <b>rechargeable</b> halogen lights, though they are still expensive. They can be fastened to the bicycle handlebars with various mounting devices such as a lock-block. Although the optics of these flashlights are generally high quality they are still rotationally symmetrical (unlike motor vehicle lights).|$|E
25|$|Another type of {{alkaline}} batteries are secondary <b>rechargeable</b> alkaline battery, which allows reuse of specially designed cells.|$|E
25|$|Cost of batteries, {{unless they}} are <b>rechargeable.</b> This stops it being {{low-cost}} due {{to the amount of}} batteries used over time.|$|E
25|$|A {{supercapacitor}} (SC) (also electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC), {{also called}} supercap, ultracapacitor or Goldcap) is a high-capacity capacitor with capacitance values {{much higher than}} other capacitors (but lower voltage limits) that {{bridge the gap between}} electrolytic capacitors and <b>rechargeable</b> batteries. They typically store 10 to 100 times more energy per unit volume or mass than electrolytic capacitors, can accept and deliver charge much faster than batteries, and tolerate many more charge and discharge cycles than <b>rechargeable</b> batteries.|$|E
