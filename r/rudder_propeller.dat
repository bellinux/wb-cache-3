The <b>rudder,</b> <b>propeller</b> and steering engine were destroyed. The ship settled by the stern and sank within an hour.

50|$|Hull {{technology}} is the innovation and R&D that the manufacturers put into their boats to ensure the best stock wake possible. Many boarders use aftermarket ballast and lead to further weigh down their boats for very large wakes or for sports such as wake surfing. Most wakeboat manufacturers have installed factory ballast but sometimes more weight is needed. Ballast can {{take the form of}} hard tanks or soft bags which are filled with water from the body of water the boat is being operated on. Wakeboard boats have a certain type of hull to allow for bigger wakes. The bigger the wake the more the stern is sitting in the water. These boats are not good for shallow waters considering their draft is roughly over 3 feet. There is a <b>rudder</b> <b>propeller</b> and shaft drive along with three fins directly under the boat. Shallow waters with that much instruments under the boat will call for disaster. These boats are not good substitutes for fishing boats for that reason. Most fishing boats have a flat bottom hull and an outboard motor which is completely retractable. They also have a plastic trolling motor in case they ever get into sticky situations. Wakeboard boats offer depth finders to keep out of the shallow stuff. People often think that if they ruin a prop on an inboard that it will be an easy fix. Inboard props do not come off without a special tool that can be costly.|$|E

40|$|Cavitation erosion on {{propellers}} and rudders {{remains a}} problem in the marine industry. The consequences of failing to detect the risk of erosion damage during the design phase, and early in the service life of a vessel, include reducing the speed of the vessel, unscheduled dry-dockings and repairs or replacement of the propellers or rudders. The associated costs are borne by the builder and owner and may harm their reputations within the industry. Lloyd's Register has developed and tested a unique measurement system, based on acoustic emission techniques, which is capable of detecting the onset of erosion damage on propellers and rudders. The system uses high frequency transducers to quantify the impulsive energy transmitted from imploding cavitation events through the material paths of <b>rudder,</b> <b>propeller</b> and shafting configurations. The acoustic emission signals from such events have been synchronised with visual observations using high speed video equipment and borescopes...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe recent {{researches}} on {{the automatic}} berthing control problems have used {{various kinds of}} tools as a control method such as expert system, fuzzy logic controllers and artificial neural network (ANN).

In a marine context, the berthing maneuver is a complicated procedure in which both human experience and intensive control operations are involved. Nowadays, in most cases of berthing operation, auxiliary devices are used to make the schedule safer and faster but none of above researches has taken into account. In this study, ANN is applied to design the controllers for automatic ship berthing using assistant devices such as bow thruster and tug. Using back-propagation algorithm, we trained ANN with set of teaching data to get a minimal error between output values and desired values of four control outputs including <b>rudder,</b> <b>propeller</b> revolution, bow thruster and tug. Then, computer simulations of automatic berthing were carried out to verify the effecttiveness of the system.

5000|$|The misgivings of {{building}} a pure [...] "all or nothing" [...] ship were that they had areas still vulnerable to guns of even modest warships, small arms fire, and blast damage from a ship's own guns. For instance, blast damage was to plague the careers of the Nelsons, a situation aggravated by the positioning of her guns. It was also considered demoralizing for crew, such as those serving in the secondary batteries, {{to know that they}} had no protection. The superstructure, for instance, housed crucial command stations, communications, and radar equipment. Other critical areas such as the <b>rudder,</b> <b>propellers,</b> and bow could not be armored so damage to these areas could reduce a ship's maneuverability and buoyancy.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} wind tunnel tests on a rudder {{operating}} downstream of a propeller and hull combination are presented. The tests used the 3. 5 m x 2. 5 m low speed wind tunnel at the University of Southampton. This report {{presents the results}} for two rudders, one all-movable the other a semi-balanced skeg-rudder. The rudders both have a mean chord of 667 mm and NACA 0020 sections, but with varying taper ratio. A four bladed, 800 mm diameter, adjustable pitch propeller was used. This propeller is {{a modified version of}} the Wageningen B 4. 40 series. Open-water results for the modified design were validated against published data. The <b>rudder</b> <b>propeller</b> combinations were tested both in a freestream and in way of a representative Mariner stern hull form. The test consisted of a series of parametric studies into the effect of the longitudinal and lateral distance between the propeller and <b>rudder,</b> <b>propeller</b> thrust loading, presence of a hull, and presence of a hull at a yaw angle. A five-component strain-gauge dynamometer was used to measure lift, drag and three moments on the rudder. A rotating strain gauge dynamometer measured the developed thrust and torque of the propeller. In addition, both spanwise and chordwise pressure distributions were measured on the rudder and hull surface to provide a detailed knowledge of the distribution of forces over the hull and the rudder. A tunnel wind speed of 10 m/s was used and propeller revolutions were varied between 0 and 2100 rpm. Results are presented in the form of non-dimensional coefficients of lift (C subscript L), drag (C subscript D), spanwise (CP subscript S) and chordwise (CP subscript C) position of the centre of pressure variation with incidence for the rudder. The influence of rudder on propeller performance is given in terms of non-dimensional thrust (K subscript T) coefficient variation with advance ratio (J). The surface pressure measurements on the rudder are presented as both a spanwise distribution of the local lift coefficient and as a surface pressure distribution. The surface pressure measurements on the hull are presented as spanwise and chordwise distritbutions together with integrated normal force coefficient over the range of rudder angles. The results provide data data for detailed rudder design, for numerical modelling of the rudder/propeller and hull interaction problem and for use in manoeuvring simulations...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation has}} been carried out into the interaction between a ship rudder and propeller combination. The tests used the 11 ' x 8 ' low speed wind tunnel at the University of Southampton. This report presents results for a series of three all-movable rudders with the same mean chord of 667 mm and NACA 0020 sections, but with varying aspect ratio and taper ratio. A four-bladed, 800 mm diameter, adjustable pitch propeller was used. This propeller is {{a modified version of the}} Wageningen B 4. 40 series. Open-water results for the modified design were validated against published data. The test consisted of a series of parametric studies into the effect of the longitudinal distance between the propeller and <b>rudder,</b> <b>propeller</b> thrust loading, rudder aspect ratio, and rudder taper ratio. A five-component strain-gauge dynamometer was used to measure lift, drag and three moments on the rudder and a rotating strain gauge dynamometer the developed thrust and torque of the propeller. In addition, both spanwise and chordwise pressure distributions were measured on the rudder surface. Propeller revolutions were varied between 0 and 3, 000 rpm and tunnel wind speeds up to 20 m/s were used. Results are presented in the form of non-dimensional coefficients of lift (C subscript L), drag (C subscript D), spanwise (CP subscript S) and chordwise (CP subscript C) position of the centre of pressure variation with incidence for the rudder. The influence of rudder on propeller performance is given in terms of non-dimensional thrust (K subscript T) and torque (K subscript Q) coefficient variation with advance ratio (J). The surface pressure measurements on the rudder are presented as both a spanwise distribution of the local lift coefficient (C subscript L) and as a surface pressure distribution. Principal findings of the work were that: increasing propeller thrust loading increased rudder sideforce while delaying stall. For constant rpm the presence of the rudder alters the propellers developed thrust and torque characteristic. Changes in the longitudinal separation of the rudder and propeller had only a minimal effect on the sideforce characteristics of the rudder. The information presented should be of considerable use in numerically modelling the flow interaction and in the development of more advanced ship manoeuvring simulations...|$|E
40|$|Shiphandling tugs are a {{critical}} aspect of ship manoeuvring in confined waters. Knowledge {{of their performance}} and effective use in various situations provide necessary guidance for the marine pilot and tug master to improve shiphandling techniques. Shiphandling simulators are a well accepted tool for training of marine pilots, development of port operational procedures and port development studies. Realistic simulation of shiphandling manoeuvres requires not only a reliable hydrodynamic model of the ship, but also precise representation of the forces available from the assisting tugs. In the past, the limited capabilities of tugs meant that force prediction and evaluation of operating procedures was a relatively simple matter. However, the push for expanding and more efficient port operations {{has led to a}} new generation of shiphandling tugs being introduced into major Australian ports during the 1980 's. These tugs are of greater displacement, power and manoeuvrability compared with their twin screw predecessors and represent a significant technological step. Increased manoeuvrability of the so called omni-directional stern drive tug has been achieved through the fitting of azimuthing thrusters, which are capable of producing thrust in any direction. The enhanced manoeuvrability of the omni-directional stern drive tug and increased power has enabled significant increases {{to be made in the}} efficiency of shiphandling operations, particularly in the ability to assist at speed. However, to fully realise the potential of these complex vessels a more thorough understanding of their hydrodynamic aspects is required. Further, with increased speed greater consideration needs to be given to the interaction of tug forces with those produced by the ship's <b>rudder,</b> <b>propeller</b> and hull. To investigate the performance and effectiveness of omni-directional stern drive tugs, a series of physical model tests has been performed. Hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull and thrusters have been measured, with particular attention being paid to hydrodynamic interactions between thrusters and the thrusters and hull. Measurements were initially made of forces acting on a bare tug hull and a single thruster in open water. Thruster-thruster interaction was determined from measurement of forces acting on twin thrusters in open water and thruster-hull interaction was determined from measurement of total forces and those acting on the thrusters of a self-propelled free-running model. Data derived from the model tests has been used to construct a mathematical model which may be solved using equilibrium or, in the time domain, as may be desired for real time simulation. Quasi-steady predictions of tug forces have been used to identify general performance, optimum operating techniques and the influence of tug forces on ship motions in confined waters. In cooperation with Australian towage operators, practical findings from this investigation have been detailed in a manual to assist tug masters and marine pilots. In addition to harbour tugs, this work may also provide insight into the manoeuvring of escort tugs and other vessels with omni-directional propulsion...|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{basis for a}} lifting surface model using Morino's formulation is given in this report. The various choices made previously for modelling <b>rudder</b> and <b>propeller</b> interactions are described {{and the reasons for}} using, in this investigation, a lifting surface perturbation potential method. An explicit trailing edge pressure Kutta-Joukowsky condition is used to ensure that there is no pressure loading at the trailing edge. A frozen wake or an adaptive wake model can be chosen for both the <b>rudder</b> and <b>propeller</b> simulations. A flexible scheme for geometry definition was developed to allow flow over a wide variety of geometries and multiple body lifting-surface problems.
