500|$|Nepenthes rajah has an altitudinal {{distribution}} of 1500–2650m a.s.l. {{and is thus}} considered an (ultra) highland or Upper Montane plant. In the upper limit of its range, night-time temperatures may approach freezing and day-time maxima rarely exceed 25℃. Due to the night-time temperature drop, <b>relative</b> <b>air</b> <b>humidity</b> increases significantly, rising from 65–75% to over 95%. Vegetation at this height is very stunted and slow-growing due to the extreme environmental conditions that prevail. Plants are often subjected to fierce winds and driving rain, as well as exposure to intense direct sunlight. The relatively open vegetation of the upper montane forest also experiences greater fluctuations in temperature and humidity compared with lower altitudes. These changes are largely governed by the extent of cloud cover. In the absence of clouds, temperatures rise rapidly, humidity drops, and light levels may be very high. When cloud cover returns, temperatures and light levels fall, while humidity levels increase. [...] Average annual precipitation in this region is around 3000mm.|$|E
500|$|Italian {{folklore}} {{holds that}} porcini sprout {{up at the}} time of the new moon; research studies have tried to investigate more scientifically the factors that influence the production of fruit bodies. Although fruit bodies may appear any time from summer to autumn (June to November in the UK), their growth is known to be triggered by rainfall during warm periods of weather followed by frequent autumn rain with a drop in soil temperature. Above average rainfall may result in the rapid appearance of large numbers of boletes, in what is known in some circles as a [...] "bolete year". A 2004 field study indicated that fruit body production is enhanced by an open and sunny wood habitat, corroborating an earlier observation made in a Zimbabwean study; removal of the litter layer on the forest floor appeared to have a negative effect on fruit body production, but previous studies reported contradictory results. A Lithuanian study conducted in 2001 concluded that the maximal daily growth rate of the cap (about 21mm or 0.8in) occurred when the <b>relative</b> <b>air</b> <b>humidity</b> was the greatest, and the fruit bodies ceased growing when the air humidity dropped below 40%. Factors most likely to inhibit the appearance of fruit bodies included prolonged drought, inadequate air and soil humidity, sudden decreases of night air temperatures, and the appearance of the first frost.

40|$|There are {{indications}} that the adsorption of water-soluble gases like NH 3 and SO 2 on a leaf surface may {{be compared with the}} dry deposition on a freely accessible water layer. The aim of our study was to quantify the thickness of the apparent water layer on the leaf surface. The thickness was calculated from NH 3 adsorption data on leaves. Also we performed weighing experiments with dried leaves of different plant species at <b>relative</b> <b>air</b> <b>humidities</b> of 20 and 95 % (at 20 oC), respectively. From the increase in weight the water film thickness was calculated. The thickness calculated from NH 3 adsorption data strongly depends on <b>air</b> <b>humidity</b> and varied from 10 m at low relative humidities to 100 m at high relative humidities. However, the maximum water layer thicknesses obtained for the dried leaves were much lower (8. 8 - 17. 9 m). We postulate that the cuticular membrane may behave as a ''valve'' between the inner and outer region of the leaf and that its permeability is controlled by the <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> of the <b>air.</b> This view may be a fundamental contribution to the representation of the mechanism of the dry deposition of gaseous compounds to the vegetation...|$|R
50|$|Resistive {{electrolytic}} hygrometers use a {{sensing element}} {{in the form of}} a liquid electrolyte held in between of two small glass rods by capillary force.

After the reconstruction of residential building, which was comprised of replacement of windows, thermal insulation of external wall and regulation of heating, the dwellers were complaining about different problems.

The high number of unspecified allergies was among the newly arisen allergies. Furthermore, the high increase of CHOCHP - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory problems were detected mainly by elderly people. The experimental measurements of indoor climate were carried out in order to find the causes of increased sickness rate. The most critical was the <b>air</b> <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> from the parameters of indoor climate. Long-term high values of <b>air</b> <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> were discovered and there was a search for the link with the number of efficient natural ventilation per day.

After five months, the questionnaire survey was carried out again, which showed the decrease of mainly allergic and respiratory problems.
