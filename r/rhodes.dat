5|$|On the January 11, 2010 {{episode of}} Raw, guest host Mike Tyson {{announced}} that the winner of a triple threat match later that night between Orton, Kingston, and John Cena would challenge Sheamus for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble. Orton ultimately won {{with the help of}} The Legacy, who attacked Cena and Kingston. At the Royal Rumble, Orton failed to win the championship when he was disqualified when <b>Rhodes</b> tried to interfere. After the match, Orton attacked <b>Rhodes</b> and DiBiase, who attempted to aid <b>Rhodes.</b> On the February 15 episode of Raw, Orton took on Sheamus in a non-title rematch, but was again disqualified after <b>Rhodes</b> and DiBiase interfered. During the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, in which both Orton and DiBiase participated, <b>Rhodes</b> passed a pipe to DiBiase. DiBiase hit Orton with it, and eliminated him. The next night on Raw, The Legacy participated in a six-man tag team match against Kingston, Yoshi Tatsu, and Evan Bourne, designed to show their unity, but Orton attacked <b>Rhodes</b> and DiBiase and the following week on Raw, <b>Rhodes</b> and DiBiase attacked Orton in retaliation, although Orton was able to fight them off. Orton's split from the group was cemented when he lost a handicap match against both <b>Rhodes</b> and DiBiase on Raw and showed increasing signs of becoming a fan favorite. This led to a Triple Threat Match between all three members at WrestleMania XXVI, where <b>Rhodes</b> and DiBiase proclaimed neither minded not winning so long as Orton was pinned, but in the match Orton pinned DiBiase. DiBiase and <b>Rhodes</b> attacked each other during the match, ending the duo, and <b>Rhodes</b> was punted by Orton and taken out of action for approximately a month. The split was confirmed when <b>Rhodes</b> moved to SmackDown brand during the 2010 WWE Supplemental Draft.|$|E

The following week, Manu and Snuka informed <b>Rhodes</b> that they were intending to assault Orton and had brought someone to help them do so, giving <b>Rhodes</b> an ultimatum to choose a side. When <b>Rhodes</b> refused to side with them, Manu and Snuka brought out a returning Ted DiBiase to aid them, and tried to assault <b>Rhodes</b> and Orton.
