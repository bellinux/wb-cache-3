50|$|An {{example of}} <b>reverse</b> <b>commuting</b> {{can be found}} in the Washington Metropolitan Area. Due to a {{combination}} of ample transit infrastructure and the height limit in downtown, employment options in the area follow a polycentric model, heavily focused in both Downtown and areas such as Arlington, Tysons Corner, Bethesda, and Silver Spring. Companies desiring space in Washington often opt for space in Maryland or Virginia because of the great expense of office space downtown. As such, there are many people who live in Washington and work in Maryland and Virginia, either driving, taking Metrobus, Metrorail, or carpooling.|$|E

5000|$|The station, {{along with}} the {{downtown}} Greenwich railroad station, is receiving increasing numbers of [...] "reverse commuters" [...] who work in Stamford but live in New York City. <b>Reverse</b> <b>commuting</b> has doubled from 1997 to 2007 and increased 150 percent since 1990, with 1,900 reverse commuters as of 2007. Younger employees, often single and with enough money to live in Manhattan, for instance, sometimes prefer to live there, although more housing and nightlife have come to Downtown Stamford in recent years. Metro-North has added trains and express service to serve these commuters. As financial companies move to Stamford from Manhattan, some employees often become reverse commuters. Larger companies that are farther away {{than a few minutes}} walk from the station routinely provide shuttle service for their workers.|$|E
50|$|Commuter trains {{come into}} Stamford from all points between New London {{to the east}} and New York (Grand Central Terminal) to the south. Many express ({{non-stop}}) trains leave Stamford each morning and evening for Grand Central. The average non-stop commute is forty-seven minutes. Stamford has seen a significant increase in ridership. Much of this increase is a result of <b>reverse</b> <b>commuting,</b> individuals commuting from New York City to Stamford for work. Trains operate from the Stamford station between 4:43 AM (first departure to Grand Central) until 12:55 AM (last departure to Grand Central). On the weekends the first departure for Grand Central occurs at 5:03 AM. Fares during rush hour (on peak) are higher than during non-rush hour (off peak). On peak fares are charged between 4:43 AM - 9:10 AM for trains originating to Grand Central. Trains in transit to Stamford are charged on peak fares from 5:35 AM - 8:37 AM and from 4:02 PM - 7:40 PM. On peak fares do not apply on weekends and/or holidays. Tickets can be bought on board, yet the surcharge can make the price steep.|$|E
50|$|The reverse {{commuter}} {{travels in}} the opposite direction to the regular daily population flow, and therefore encounters fewer of the road traffic congestion problems faced by regular commuters. An advantage of this system is the usage of otherwise empty transit capacity: no additional trains or travel lanes are necessary to accommodate people riding or driving from downtown to the outskirts in the morning, and likewise back downtown at night. Train and bus routes may be more sparse in the reverse direction, but the vehicles have to get back somehow for their next journey in most cases. However, track capacity on some train routes like the Long Island Rail Road Ronkonkoma Branch and the New Jersey Transit Gladstone Branch significantly reduces or even eliminates reverse commute options. Hence, transit usage can be lower for reverse-commuters than regular commuters. In some cases, <b>reverse</b> <b>commuting</b> has become quite popular. For example, Metro-North Railroad runs rush hour New Haven Line trains from New York City to Stamford, CT and surrounding suburbs to accommodate its many reverse commuters. Low unemployment rates in the suburbs may help to fuel the increase over the past years in reverse commuter ridership.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLarge Brazilian cities, {{particularly}} those that have experienced rapid population growth {{since the middle of}} the last century, have exhibited significant signs of population dispersion in their peripheries in recent decades. A study of the population&# 8217;s spatial redistribution in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte (MRBH) confirms this finding. In the process of dispersion, the levels of urban commuting increase, and commuting becomes a relevant indicator of the degree of integration within the metropolis. This paper evaluates the current magnitude and main features of <b>reverse</b> <b>commuting,</b> as characterized by the daily displacements of the population that resides not in the periphery but rather in the core. Flows from the metropolitan core towards the peripheral municipalities are examined using sample microdata on the MRBH municipalities from the 2000 and 2010 demographic censuses by combining the variables of "municipality of residence" and "municipality of work/study. " The results indicate an increase in <b>reverse</b> <b>commuting</b> in both absolute and relative terms. When this flow is compared totraditional commuting (periphery/center), the relative values are considerable. In some cases, this relationship reaches notably high values, as the case of Confins (the municipality where the international airport is located), and also municipalities that are part of a relatively old conurbation, such as Nova Lima and Betim...|$|E

Unlike other new towns such as Tongzhou and Yizhuang, Yizhuang is designed to be a suburban job center. It makes the light rail in Yizhuang a unique case, which is designed as a <b>reverse</b> <b>commuting</b> urban metro line. Historically, Yizhuang was a small rural village until 1994 when it was selected as a National Economic Development Zone. According to the 2004 Beijing master plan, the Yizhuang New Town was planned as a high-tech industrial center and an advanced manufacturing center, with a total population of 300, 000 in 2010 and estimated population of 700, 000 in 2020; it is the result of evacuation of both jobs and population from the city center. The light rail line is designed to be the essential transportation facility to draw employees from urban center to economic development zone in the new town, achieving the objectives of population evacuation.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{substantial}} {{decline in the}} degree of racial segregation in the U. S. housing market reported in the 2000 census, most African Americans still reside in communities that are geographically separate from those of white Amer-icans. 1 Continued racial disparities in income, education, and employment mean that housing segregation is accompanied by the concentration of poverty and high rates of joblessness in predominantly black neighborhoods. The concentration of black households in older, predominantly inner-city neighborhoods, coupled with the continuing decentralization of employment within metropolitan areas, reduces the access to jobs of low-skilled inner-city residents. Lack of access is compounded by public transit systems that do not facilitate <b>reverse</b> <b>commuting</b> and by low rates of automobile ownership among poor minority households. This “spatial mismatch ” between the locations of low-skilled jobs and the residences of low-skilled workers has been a focus of labor economists since the late 1960 s. 2 During the 1980 s, concern with the employment effects of residential seg-regation was subordinated to a more general concern with the external effect...|$|E
40|$|Employment {{decentralisation}} may {{be defined}} as a process by which city-regions increase the proportion of jobs that are located outside of their central business district (CBD) and its immediate frame. Brisbane is actively moving to decentralise, with the Queensland Government embarking on targeted workplace relocations to move 20 per cent of its office space out of the CBD by 2017. This paper explores the transport impacts of such decentralisation policies in Brisbane. It uses the Modular Urban Land Use and Transport Tool (MULUTT), developed at Griffith University in collaboration with GAMUT. The framework combines accessibility analysis and other components with the multi-modal Brisbane Strategic Transport Model and allows for more holistic examination of the likely impacts of changes to transport and land use arrangements in the city. Results are provided in terms of job-housing balance, vehicle kilometres travelled, travel time, levels of service on key links and public transport patronage/mode share.

30|$|Yizhuang in Beijing is a {{suitable}} case {{for studying the}} impact of light rail systems on land use in a suburban new town. The Yizhuang light rail line is planned to support the city center and near-suburban residents commuting to far suburban new town. Exploring the GIS-based spatial analysis, this paper compares the planned and actual patterns of land use within a 1 -km radius area of three stations along the Yizhuang line. It finds that the gap between plan and reality in the land use pattern is significant, especially around the Jinghailu station {{at the end of}} the rail line, where an industrial-oriented model is adopted. The land use change over time also reveals the importance of commercial land in supporting a successful TOD model. Without attractive facilities and amenities provided by commercial land, the daily needs of resident and employees are not met. Additionally, the planned <b>reverse</b> <b>commuting</b> pattern fails to realize the aims of evacuation population and jobs from city center, due to the mismatch between the existing low-skilled job opportunities and the high-skilled residents in the area as illustrated in Fig. 7.|$|E

40|$|Employment {{decentralisation}} may {{be defined}} as a process by which city-regions increase the proportion of jobs that are located outside of their central business district (CBD) and its immediate frame. The Queensland Government has embarked on a program of targeted program of employment decentralisation, seeking to move 20 per cent of it's office space, or around 5, 600 public servants, out of the centre by 2017 (Sectorwide 2008 : 2). This paper explores the transport impacts of such decentralisation policies for greater Brisbane. A methodological framework is developed from a review of previous modelling efforts exploring decentralisation and office relocations in Oslo, Melbourne and in US cities. Scenarios based on the Queensland Government's program are developed. The multi-modal Brisbane Strategic Transport Model is then used to examine the likely impacts of this Queensland Government's initiatives.

30|$|Transit-oriented {{development}} (TOD) is {{advocated by}} urban planners {{as a tool}} to promote transportation and land use integration, and it has especially been applied in new town developments in Chinese cities. Since 2000, urban metro system construction in Beijing has accelerated and many new towns in suburban areas have emerged due to rail transit connections with the central city. This paper is a case study of Yizhuang new town, which is located in the southeast suburban area of Beijing. It explores whether light rail is successful in promoting transportation and land use integration. First, by comparing the land use within a 1 km radius of three rail stations, findings suggest that the TOD model in terms of land use may not be implemented. Second, by tracing land use changes over time, we found that commercial functions are critical to support TOD development. Third, the mismatch of urban functions between low-skilled labor employment opportunities and high-skilled residential neighborhoods emphasizes the failure of planned <b>reverse</b> <b>commuting</b> patterns. In conclusion, our findings suggest that without a proper land use policy, TOD based on light rail only may not be a successful model in the case of Yizhuang new town. The policy implication is that the planning code of land use should be more flexible and adaptable, in order to promote the integration of transportation and land use in a synergetic way.|$|E
40|$|What are the {{transport}} effects of government office decentralization policies in cities with strong mono-centric structures? Decentralization {{may be defined}} as the process by which city-regions increase the proportion of jobs that are located outside of their central business district (CBD) and its immediate frame. There is a resurgence of state-led decentralization activity in Australia, with governments promising to move 20 % of all city center public servants out to middle- and outer-suburban locations in two of the largest cities, Perth and Brisbane, within a decade. Yet {{the transport}} impacts of these policies have not been assessed or meaningfully considered by government. Two key research activities are reported on to address this research gap. An extensive review of previous modeling and travel behavior studies on mono- vs. poly-centric urban structures and of workplace relocation programs is summarized. This highlights mixed results for the transport sector, and identifies possible research paths to identify impacts for cities where decentralization is proposed. This leads to a large modeling effort using the multi-modal Brisbane Strategic Transport Model, examining the likely impacts under specific decentralization scenarios for Greater Brisbane. Results are provided in terms of modal shares, vehicle kilometers travelled, travel time, levels of service on key links and transit patronage. The type of decentralization policy selected has effects on <b>reverse</b> <b>commuting</b> and transit use. The results suggest only those policies directing employment to key rail and busway nodes will mitigate potentially adverse impacts.
