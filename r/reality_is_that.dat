25|$|Despite ISIL {{claims that}} its {{officers}} “do not rule on any case, but rather transfer cases to the court,” the <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> extrajudicial detainment and torture are commonplace in ISIL-held territory. According {{to a report}} released by Amnesty International in December 2013, ISIL maintained at least seven large detention facilities throughout Raqqa and Aleppo provinces.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{misconception}} among some Hiligaynon speakers that Kinaray-a is a dialect of Hiligaynon; the <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the two belong to two different, but related, language subgroups (Visayan). However, some Karay-a have also Hiligaynon as their second language. To some extent, {{there is an}} intermediate dialect of Hiligaynon and Kinaray-a being spoken in Mindanao, mainly in Sultan Kudarat province.|$|E

3000|$|When {{discussing}} why mothers may get depressed {{one mother}} talked of the rude shock when motherhood {{was not as}} portrayed in the “Huggies adverts”. The <b>reality</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> her baby would not stop crying. She spoke of the frustration of {{not knowing what to}} do after checking the “three things they told me to check”. She had the expectation that when she got home she would know what to do and “it will be all good”. But the <b>reality</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> “it doesn’t work like that”. (FG 2) [...]...|$|R

25|$|While it was {{believed}} that the parish was fully behind fight for independence, the <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> during the Revolution the parish was quite conflicted. Figures such as Col. John Nielson, and Brigadier General Anthony White did, in fact, fight on behalf of the Patriots. But the church also contained its share of Loyalists, such as John Antill, who fought with the 2nd Battalion of the New Jersey Volunteers (a Loyalist force).|$|E
25|$|Ideally, the {{computational}} method {{will be able}} to predict affinity before a compound is synthesized and hence in theory only one compound needs to be synthesized, saving enormous time and cost. The <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> present {{computational method}}s are imperfect and provide, at best, only qualitatively accurate estimates of affinity. In practice it still takes several iterations of design, synthesis, and testing before an optimal drug is discovered. Computational methods have accelerated discovery by reducing the number of iterations required and have often provided novel structures.|$|E
25|$|The {{long history}} of the West in popular culture tends to define those clothed in Western {{clothing}} as cowboys or cowgirls whether they have ever been on a horse or not. This is especially true when applied to entertainers {{and those in the}} public arena who wear western wear as part of their persona. However, the <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> many people, particularly in the West, including lawyers, bankers, and other white collar professionals wear elements of Western clothing, particularly cowboy boots or hats, as a matter of form even though they have other jobs. Conversely, some people raised on ranches do not necessarily define themselves cowboys or cowgirls unless they feel their primary job is to work with livestock or if they compete in rodeos.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, we {{are forced}} to testify that Bourguiba's Tunisia could no more be called secular than Ben Ali's or the rest of the Arab Muslim states, for more than a {{neutrality}} of orientation and the religious freedom of the state, secularism implies the autonomy of public and religious institutions. The <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the institutional presence of Islam in Tunisia, although strictly circumscribed, is truly a constant reference, implicit or explicit, legitimizing the regime's direction. Certainly, Tunisian public services are accessible to all without distinction of creed and the constitution guarantees religious freedom, so long as it does not threaten public order, but Islam remains the state religion, {{to the extent that it}} is said it is obligatory for the president of the republic to be able to assert it.|$|E
25|$|A sea kayak's {{primary safety}} device is its paddler. Although some kayakers {{consider}} a well-practised self-righting move {{such as an}} Eskimo roll to be essential in order to safe open-water kayaking, it is the technique of bracing that every well-trained, experienced kayaker practises {{in order to maintain}} an upright position in their kayak. Practice in bracing is often neglected by inexperienced kayakers once they have learned the Eskimo roll. However, the <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> having to roll really means having to recover from a failed brace. Being in the capsized position in some environments due to missing a brace can put the paddler in danger of colliding with obstacles under the water. Staying upright in surf zones, rocky surf zones (informally known as rock gardens), and rivers is most important and is only accomplished through well-practised and successful bracing.|$|E
25|$|The musical {{genre that}} was once {{rejected}} by mainstream Christian churches is now considered by some {{as one of the}} most-important recruitment tool of their successor congregations. According to Terri McLean, author of New Harmonies, old-guard churches (United Methodist is given as an example) of the late 1990s were experiencing a rapid decline in membership and were under threat of disbandment within the next decade, a trend that has been going on since the 1980s. McLean, using numerous quotes from theologians, Christian apologists and professors, goes on to offer contemporary Christian music as the reason for the falling popularity of more traditionalist churches. The definition of contemporary Christian, as offered by New Harmonies, is of a genre not far removed from traditional hymns; it is simply more accessible. The <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> while a form of modernized hymns do exist in today's churches and do affect church recruitment, there also exists both within and outside these churches a form of music (Christian rock) that has only one element in common with previous religious genres: its worship of God.|$|E
50|$|The {{political}} <b>reality</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Bundesrat, {{in spite}} of its authority, was pushed into the background by the Kaiser and the Reich Chancellor due to the simple fact that the Prussian minister-president often held the office of Reich chancellor simultaneously and was thus chairman of the Bundesrat.|$|R

25|$|The {{reasonable}} suspicion {{test has}} {{the intention of}} protecting public confidence, but Leo and Chen wonder how accurately this test actually reflects the public's view. The test as formulated in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin requires that the reasonable man be sitting in court and in the know of all the relevant facts. However, this is usually not the case. Most of the public only receives information in bits and pieces, and thus even if a case passes the reasonable suspicion test, the public may not be satisfied {{that there was no}} possibility of bias. Thus the concept that the reasonable suspicion test reflects the public's perspective is overstated. The practical <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when the reasonable man is imbued with all the relevant facts, he will essentially be in the same position as the court. Therefore, the suggested approach is that the court, in personifying the reasonable man, should take into account all relevant circumstances and determine if there is the suspicion or possibility of the appearance of bias whilst being mindful to exclude considerations stemming from the individual judge's personal preferences, special knowledge and legal sophistication.|$|E
25|$|Over 1,000 economists (including Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, Jeffrey Sachs and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz), {{more than}} 1,000 parliamentarians from over 30 countries, the world's major labor leaders, the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and for Citizens' Action, Occupy Wall Street protesters, Oxfam, War on Want {{and other major}} {{development}} groups, the World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace and other major environmental organizations support a FTT. Other notable supporters include the Archbishop of Canterbury, Bill Gates and Michael Moore. David Harding, founder and CEO of one of London's biggest hedge funds has given qualified support for a European tax on financial transactions, breaking ranks with many of his peers fiercely opposed to such a measure. Speculator George Soros, put forward a different proposal, calling rich countries to donate their special drawing rights {{for the purpose of}} providing international assistance, without necessarily dismissing the Tobin tax idea. It has been widely reported that the Pope backs such a tax. However, the <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a commission of the Vatican of which the Pope is not a member merely said that such a tax would be worth reflecting on.|$|E

Tens of millions of dollars went down the drain {{because of the way the}} whole thing was mishandled.

I was so nervous coming in, you try and tell yourself that {{the worst thing that}} can happen is a loss and starting again tomorrow, but the <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this matters so much.

500|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 25,000 tickets, {{with the remaining}} 25,000 being sent out to other clubs. 17,500 of those tickets were available to Southampton season ticket holders. Seat prices for the final exceeded £80, with the cheapest tickets available at £25. Southampton was given the South Stand, which was the larger end of the stadium, whereas Arsenal was situated at the opposite end. Although Southampton supporters were disappointed at the allocation share, chairman Rupert Lowe refused to criticise the FA's decision, by saying: [...] "The <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> too {{many people want to}} go and there are never enough tickets." [...] In the lead up to the final, the South Wales Echo reported that many tickets were being sold on the black market, for [...] "20 times" [...] the face-value price.|$|E

500|$|Other {{analysts were}} troubled that the {{decision}} would leave [...] "a murky landscape for law enforcement". John Charles Thomas, representing the National District Attorneys Association, concluded [...] "The pressure is basically {{to err on the}} side of caution, to give the Miranda warning almost every time."

[...] "The <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> even with Miranda warnings, it's doubtful that young people understand exactly what it all means and understand their choices, and so in the long run, I doubt that there will be many fewer confessions because of this opinion." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] is [...] "a romantic {{song about}} growing old" [...] {{according}} to singer Gruff Rhys.

The band abandoned the idea of making a [...] "save the world" [...] concept album as they reasoned that [...] "when people talk about saving the world they're really talking about saving humans. The <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> humans are the problem". [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] expands on this idea with Rhys stating that the song is about the extinction of the human race: [...] "maybe we'll all die but the world'll still be here, even if it's a dark, singed piece of rock flying around the sun". The track was recorded in 2000 at Bearsville Studios, Woodstock and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.|$|E
500|$|Lin's {{experience}} in the NBA draft {{was used as an}} example in the nonfiction psychology book The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis, which details how stereotypes can overwhelmingly influence a person's decision making, {{even in the face of}} contradictory evidence. In the book, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey stated that Lin did very well in pre-draft testing. [...] "He lit up our [...] model," [...] said Morey. [...] "Our model said take him with, like, the 15th pick in the draft." [...] A year after the Rockets failed to draft Lin, they began to measure the speed of a player’s first two steps; Lin had the quickest first move of any player measured, and he was able to change direction far more quickly than most NBA players. [...] "He's incredibly athletic," [...] said Morey. [...] "But the <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> every fucking person, including me, thought he was unathletic. And I can’t think of any reason for it other than he was Asian." ...|$|E
