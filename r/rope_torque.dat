50|$|In principle, spiral ropes are round strands as {{they have}} an {{assembly}} of layers of wires laid helically over a centre {{with at least one}} layer of wires being laid in the opposite direction to that of the outer layer. Spiral ropes can be dimensioned {{in such a way that}} they are non-rotating which means that under tension the <b>rope</b> <b>torque</b> is nearly zero.The open spiral rope consists only of round wires. The half-locked coil rope and the full-locked coil rope always have a centre made of round wires. The locked coil ropes have one or more outer layers of profile wires. They have the advantage that their construction prevents the penetration of dirt and water to a greater extent and it also protects them from loss of lubricant. In addition, they have one further very important advantage as the ends of a broken outer wire cannot leave the rope if it has the proper dimensions.|$|E
40|$|Six strand <b>ropes</b> {{generate}} <b>torque</b> under tension. This {{can lead}} to transfer of twist to other mooring line components, either permanently, or dynamically. The effects of this imposed twist can seriously affect strength and fatigue endurance. In order to predict the torsional interactions between components {{it is necessary to}} quantify the tension/torsion behavior of all the different categories of mooring line component, not just the six strand rope. This paper discusses the problems of torsional interaction and presents results of measurements of tension/torsion behavior of six strand rope, stud link chain and a PET fiber rope...|$|R
40|$|The project {{designed}} to be implemented to measure the level of molten iron liquid inside a tank. The design {{is based on a}} torque-controlled drive where the level of the liquid in the tank is measured using a suspended float. The float is lowered from the disc drilled around its perimeter and a lightweight <b>rope,</b> using <b>torque</b> sensitive electric drive and rotary encoder circuit to produce the pulse that is used to calculate the level of the liquid inside a tank. When the float makes contact with the liquid level surface, the torque reduces and the number of revolutions made by the disc is counted and the level is calculated using an appropriate formula and displayed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: In a {{previous}} paper the flow and free running speed characteristics of dental air turbine handpieces were discussed. The present work was {{to continue the}} analysis and characterization of these handpieces by addressing the issues of torque, power generation, efficiency and the specification of figures of merit to aid comparative testing and selection. Methods: Using {{the principle of the}} <b>rope</b> brake, <b>torque</b> was determined from stall to free running at a variety of supply pressures for fourteen models of handpiece. Using previous results for air flow rate and free running speed, power and efficiency were calculated. Results: Stall torque was demonstrated to depend on rotor position. Dynamic torque was found to closely approach the expected linear relationship over the range from stall to free running. Several figures of merit (performance indices) were identified which might be used for routine rating and specification of handpieces. Conclusions: Standardized testing can now be performed and effective figures of merit derived to characterize the behaviour of dental air turbine handpieces.

2500|$|The fourth match saw John Cena {{defend the}} WWE United States Championship against Rusev in an [...] "I Quit" [...] match At {{one point during}} the match, the fight spilled into the crowd, {{as well as the}} {{production}} area. Rusev eventually applied the Accolade on Cena. Cena did not quit, but passed out. Referee Mike Chioda informed Rusev that the match can only end when someone quits, so unlike a submission match, this one continued. Steel steps, a steel barricade, Cena tackling Rusev through the barricade, Cena using a laptop as a weapon and Rusev using the pyro table for an explosion all came into play during the match. In the end, Cena ended up using the ring <b>ropes</b> for extra <b>torque</b> on the STF he applied on Rusev. Lana then claimed that Rusev was saying [...] "I Quit" [...] in Bulgarian. As Lana was Rusev's manager, the referee obliged and Cena retained the title.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{model of the}} torsional characteristics of parallel multi-part rope systems. In such systems, the ropes may cable, or wrap around each other, depending on the combination of applied <b>torque,</b> <b>rope</b> tension, length and spacing between the rope parts. Cabling constitutes a failure that might be retrievable but as such can seriously affect {{the performance of the}} rope system. The torsional characteristics of the system are very different before and after cabling, and theoretical models are given for both situations. Laboratory tests were performed on both two and four rope systems, with measurements being made of torque at rotations from 0 to 360 deg. Tests were run with different rope spacings, tensions and lengths and the results compared with predictions from the theoretical model. The conclusion from the test results was that the theoretical model predicts both the pre- and post-cabling torsional behaviour with an acceptable level of accuracy...|$|R

50|$|Khalasis have {{a history}} dating back to over 2000 years. Derived from the Arabic word Khalas meaning release, the word Khalasi is now used both in Malayalam and in Hindi, to refer to anyone who {{releases}} a ship or boat into the water. The Khalasis of Malabar engaged in boat building and boat repair use simple but cleverly designed equipment and devices put together by ancestors that leverage muscular strength quite amazingly. Though education is hardly their strength, {{what they have in}} abundance is a natural wisdom and simple commonsense. Deceptively simple wooden winches called davars and long wooden handles called kazhas work wonders as winches, and a network of steel wires and thick coir <b>ropes</b> transmit <b>torque</b> and rotation as smoothly as any high-end machinery. Traditionally the domain of Moplah Muslims, Hindus and even Christians have since joined the cadres of this exclusive band of muscular, energetic men who trace their lineage a long way into the past.History Of BeyporeBeypore was a center of overseas commerce since ancient times. It was also a center of shipbuilding industry. Kerala had an abundant supply of wood and skilled labor which was utilized for ship building. Francis Buchanan has made a reference about the ships built at Bepore which were used for military purposes. Khalasis are a group of people traditionally involved in the construction of Urus. They are also used to draw the Urus ashore for maintenance and repair and also pushing the same back to the sea. The word Khalasi in Arabic means a dockyard worker, sailor or lascar. A member of the Muslim community in Kerala is generally known as Mappila. Since majority of the Khalasis are Muslims they came to be called a Mappila Khalasis. Beypore being an exclusive timber outlet of Kerala has been a fascination for many seafaring people, especially the Arabs. They were mainly into ship building and slowly a ship building industry developed in Beypore. Their main constructions were the Arab trading dhows (Arabic name for Uru). As the industry flourished, the demand for skilled laborers to move these ships to and from the sea increased, which in turn resulted in the rise of the Khalasis. There are many families in Beypore and Chaliam in the Kozhikode district of Kerala, who have been working as Khalasis for generations. The skills of the Khalasi community have amazed the sailors and merchants from European and Mediterranean countries, which brought them to Beypore to buy Urus. The native technique employed by Khalasis for their work is based on the principle of pulleys. The equipment consists of wooden rails, rollers and ropes. The wooden pole is moulded as windlass and pulleys and hawsers are used for leverage. As the Khalasis exert pressure on the handles with the accompaniment of their traditional work songs that fill the entire atmosphere with vigour and vitality the huge mass; be it a ship or a heavy wooden plank, moves with ease to the amusement of the watching it. Not just ships, the Idukki dam, Feroke Bridge, Vadakkumbadu Bridge and the Mahanadi Bridge in Orissa; all these huge constructions stand testimony to the amazing skills and teamwork of the Khalasi people.Their skill also had been utilised for building the huge clock in the makkah royal clock tower which possesses the world record of tallest and largest clock in the world. The incredible skill of Khalasis was also used to winch out the bogies during some of the major train accidents in India.Khalasis of Beypore and Chaliam of Kozhikode dist.|$|R
