40|$|As {{health care}} {{institutions}} restructure {{the delivery of}} services to increase efficiency and improve patient outcomes, <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> into interdisciplinary health care teams is common. The purpose of this project was for pharmacy and nursing students to learn and practice the skills important for this future professional practice. Ten nursing students enrolled at a large state-supported school of nursing and seven clinical pharmacy students from a private, liberal arts university participated in this project. The students met weekly to present joint case conferences to their interprofessional peers, practice negotiation and collabo-ration skills, and to demonstrate the unique critical thinking processes essential to their professions. Both student groups responded positively to the experience and expressed a new appreciation of the expertise of the other discipline. Implementation of similar collaborative clinical teaching models can prepare pharmacists and nurses for health care practice partnerships...|$|E
40|$|Active {{in rural}} Natal and the Kingdom of Zululand {{since the middle}} of the nineteenth century, the Norwegian Missionary Society (NMS) {{undertook}} evangelisation and other forms of ministry to urbanised Zulus in and around Durban in 1890. This sub-field became one centre of its work in the Union of South Africa, and by the time of the accession of the National Party to power in 1948, it encompassed numerous congregations and a large number of schools. The Norwegian Lutheran missionaries lagged behind many of their Swedish counterparts in responding critically to the implementation of apartheid during the late 1940 s and early 1950 s, but the forced surrender of its educational endeavours stimulated a modest increase in its prophetic voice against the social engineering of apartheid. At the same time, the Zulu Lutheran churches which the NMS had spawned were becoming autonomous bodies without missionary supervision. Although shifts in residential patterns caused by legislation compelled the <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> from time to time, most aspects of Norwegian missionary work among the Zulus in and near Durban was not severely disrupted by apartheid in the years under review...|$|E

40|$|The <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> NK-cells in {{response}} to an acute bout of exercise is thought to be an integral component of the “fight-or-flight” response, preparing the body for potential injury or infection. We showed previously that CMV seropositivity impairs the <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> NK-cells with exercise in the young. In the current study, we examined the effect of aging on the <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> NK-cells with exercise in the context of CMV. We show here that CMV blunts the exercise-induced <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> NK-cells in both younger (23 – 39 [*]yrs) and older (50 – 64 [*]yrs) subjects with older CMVneg subjects showing the largest postexercise mobilization and 1 [*]h postexercise egress of NK-cells. The blunted exercise response in CMVpos individuals was associated with a decreased relative <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> the CD 158 a+ and CD 57 + NK-cell subsets in younger and older individuals. In addition, we show that aging is associated with a CMV-independent increase in the proportion of NK-cells expressing the terminal differentiation marker CD 57, while CMV is associated with an age-dependent decrease in the proportion of NK-cells expressing the inhibitory receptors KLRG 1 (in the younger group) and CD 158 a (in the older group). Collectively, these data suggest that CMV may decrease NK-cell mediated immunosurveillance after exercise in both younger and older individuals...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of pharmaceutical care is identified through a complete {{review of the}} literature published in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy, the sole comprehensive publication of institutional pharmacy practice. The evolution is categorized according to characteristics of structure (organizational structure, the role of the pharmacist), process (drug delivery systems, formulary management, acquiring drug products, methods to impact drug therapy decisions), and outcomes (cost of drug delivery, cost of drug acquisition and use, improved safety, improved health outcomes) recorded from the 1950 s through the 1990 s. While significant {{progress has been made in}} implementing basic drug distribution systems, levels of pharmacy involvement with direct patient care is still limited. ^ A new practice framework suggests enhanced direct patient care involvement through increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional pharmacy services. Recommendations advance internal and external organizational structure relationships that position pharmacists to fully use their unique skills and knowledge to impact drug therapy decisions and outcomes. Specific strategies facilitate expansion of the breadth and scope of each process component in order to expand the depth of integration of pharmacy and pharmaceutical care within the broad healthcare environment. Economic evaluation methods formally evaluate the impact of both operational and clinical interventions. ^ Outcome measurements include specific recommendations and methods to increase efficiency of drug acquisition, emphasizing pharmacists 2 ̆ 7 roles that impact physician prescribing decisions. Effectiveness measures include those that improve safety of drug distribution systems, decrease the potential of adverse drug therapy events, and demonstrate that pharmaceutical care can significantly contribute to improvement in overall health status. ^ The implementation of the new framework is modeled on a case study at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The implementation of several new drug distribution methods facilitated the <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> from distributive functions to direct patient care activities with significant personnel and drug cost reduction. A cost-benefit analysis illustrates that framework process enhancements produced a benefit-to-cost ratio of 7. 9. In addition, measures of effectiveness demonstrated significant levels of safety and enhanced drug therapy outcomes. ...|$|E

40|$|Offering {{business}} solutions {{instead of}} selling products {{has been identified}} by many firms as a strategy to fight against price pressure through commoditisation, to strengthen relationships with customers, and to increase ‘share of wallet’. Yet, {{three out of four}} companies selling business solutions fail to see a sustainable economic impact (Johansson et al., 2003). One approach to understanding how business solution suppliers could change this situation is to develop an understanding of the life cycle of business solutions, from idea generation to redeployment. This systematic review examines how the literature conceptualises the development, deployment and <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> business solutions. It systematically identifies and then analyses 31 scholarly articles contributing to our knowledge on this issue. The review discusses the literature within the framework of four aspects. Firstly, the review proposes the processes and phases of the development and deployment of business solutions. Secondly, it presents the components <b>of</b> the <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> business solutions. Thirdly, it provides information on the actors involved in the development, deployment, and <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> business solutions, and, fourthly, it discusses the interaction forms of these actors. The discussion shows that evidence in relation to the conceptualisation of the development, deployment, and <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> business solutions remains at a superficial, tentative and inconclusive level. The major limitations of the extant literature relate to the studies’ context-specificity, their lack of theoretical underpinning, and their deficiency of including actors of the supplier and/or customer network in the empirical investigation even though there is evidence that they {{play a role in the}} development, deployment, and <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> business solutions. Based on the limitations identified, the study suggests opportunities of further research...|$|R
