Dieter Simon, Walter Wilhelm, Michael Stolleis and Marie Theres Fögen gradually broadened {{the research}} scope of the institute to the theory and sociology of law, the history of public law, international law, criminal law, the law of modern Eastern Europe and the Europe of Dictatorship in the 20th century. Today, Thomas Duve and Stefan Vogenauer focus on the transnational approach to European Legal History by pursuing research in the fields of Global History and Comparative Law. The current research profile comprises four research areas which are Multinormativity, Translation, Legal Spaces and Conflict Regulation. In addition, 14 special research fields add to the institute's profile. These are Legal Historiography, Sources, History of Private Law, History of Criminal Law and Criminal Justice, Legal History of the Church, Regulating Regimes, History of Legal Methods and Practices, Legal History of the European Union, Legal Transfer in the Common Law World, Legal History of Ibero-America, Law as a Civilising Factor in the First Millennium, the Legal History of the School of Salamanca, Governance of the Universal Church after the Council of Trent as well as Law and Diversity.

40|$|Anthropological {{scholarship}} after Marilyn Strathern {{does something}} that might surprise lawyers schooled {{in the tradition of}} 'law and society', or 'law in context'. Instead of construing law as an instrument of social forces, or as an expression of processes by which society maintains and reproduces itself, a new mode of anthropological enquiry focuses sharply on 'law itself', on what Annelise Riles calls the 'technicalities' of law. How might the legal scholar be inspired by this approach? In this article, I explore one possible way of approaching law after anthropology, which is to find within law's own archive a set of resources for an analogous <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> itself.

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{contribution}} is {{to address the}} question of the ownership of the firm. Both law and economics shape <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> the world: <b>law</b> focuses on rules and justice; economics focuses on efficiency and allocation. They describe common situations and "objects'' such as firms and their functioning, both with positive (analytical) and normative perspectives. However, their descriptions and remedies for the issues which they tackle are very different due to the differences in their philosophical and sociological goals. The Law & Economics perspective can be described as the use of the economics theoretical framework upon issues <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> In this perspective, law issues are addressed as any other economic phenomenon through the prism of efficiency. From this perspective, law is contingent upon normative conditions of economic theory and the best solution arises after a standard process of optimisation. This paper will set out a reversal of that epistemological position: instead <b>of</b> using economic <b>representations</b> to improve the state <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> will be aimed at testing and improving the economic analytical framework.

Assim, através da análise da primeira seção desta obra, considera-se a representação da lei enquanto caráter distintivo dos seres racionais, uma vez que o núcleo da investigação foi alterado, passando do conceito dever para a representação da lei. Do mesmo modo, através da análise da segunda seção da Fundamentação, o pomo de partida é aquela capacidade do ser racional, e então muda-se o núcleo da investigação, passando da capacidade da representação de leis para a racionalidade e, assim, para a razão enquanto faculdade de determinar leis em geral. Por fim, a análise da terceira seção é feita com vistas a considerar uma hipótese sobre a dedução afirmada por Kant como necessária: supõe-se que o termo que nos permite compreender as condições e os limites de tal dedução é a noção de interesse da razão, como interesse pela lei moral.

40|$|The old anthropological {{question}} of the comparison between an archaic or traditional commercial law {{on one hand and}} a modern commercial law on the other is revisited using a conceptualization of an empirical study of legal comparisons performed within the real decision-making processes at work in the current Czech justice system. Commercial law is represented by a single legal institution - the law of reciprocity (comitas gentium) - which regulates the cooperation between various legal authorities and legal systems potentially entangled in cross-border commercial disputes. The reader is first introduced to the context and evidence-dependency of any legal comparison ranging from the <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and feud in Yemen at an asylum trial, to the legal systems regulating exchange contracts in Afghanistan involving cross-border disputes. The idea of comparing legal systems as two autonomous social units is abandoned in favor of the study of the comparative practices of a small population of Czech legal authorities, which furnishes readers with plenty of questions about the social organization of legal cognition. The dissertation refrains from drawing final conclusions using legal comparisons, instead it focuses on the limitations and barriers of marshalling evidence (symbolic representations) of [...] ...|$|E

40|$|To {{the reader}} {{unfamiliar}} with African realities, the approach applied here {{is very different}} from the Western context. The African continent cannot be approached without first integrating data derived from cultural, psychological, political and economic dimensions that pervade and condition law, with emphasis on the rights. Moreover, the disconcerting aspect for the non-initiated is to be confronted with a diversity of social groups at the heart of which rights are embedded. This emphasizes an essential aspect to understanding the juridical component: the texts enacted by states do not always correspond (and often in a very small way) to the legal referent of actors. We are challenged by a diversity of particularly disconcerting juridical systems, and juridical anthropology is the only field that enables us not to fall irremediably into the trap of ethnocentrism, which tends to &# 8220;generalize&# 8221; and even &# 8220;universalize&# 8221; our <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> The specific case of land tenure is symptomatic of this: the property right, or rights, essentially defines its status or land tenure system. The diligent lawyer is required to research the issue in order to clarify the object of research: namely, what is the legal qualification of a parcel of land, pasture, forest, etc. ? What if the parcel in question is not perceived by its users as property but as an object on which their survival depends &# 8212; should the lawyer unconditionally qualify the parcel as being part of the system covering property? If institutional economists (see references) are given the possibility to attribute property status systematically to every object, we nonetheless consider that a lawyer does not possess this privilege without providing an attestation of such. The anthropological approach to law introduces a certain complexity to the case, which is often impossible to appreciate from an objective perspective...|$|E
40|$|Everyone experiences, at {{a certain}} point in life, that what the law states, how public {{services}} implement the law and how people actually behave are three different matters which are only loosely aligned. Evidently, they do have some ground in common. How can we operationally define this ground? In a context of increasing expectations concerning the quality and agility of public services, this thesis approaches this question focusing specifically on public administrations. These organizations provide a good test bench for the investigation: the semi-formalization of regulations is an advantage for modeling purposes. Their mandates are defined by the sources <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> but they have partial control over the regulatory system as well. Their implementations count as implementations <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> as they translate what is defined at policy level into operational terms. As participants in the social system, they accumulate informal knowledge of failures, such as cases of non-compliance, and of misalignment of current services with user requirements. Thus, internal and external views of an administrative organization are scattered along three domains: <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> implementations <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> and <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> behaviour. Misalignments between these three realms identify existing frictions. And it is in these frictions that social participants find reasons for behavioural and normative change. By integrating explanatory and requirement models (e. g. scenarios, business processes, use cases) with normative concepts (e. g. fundamental legal concepts), this research targets a computational applicative niche in current technologies for organizational design, specifically addressing and leveraging the knowledge of legal experts and administrators...|$|R
40|$|This {{working paper}} {{argues that the}} rise of {{transnational}} regulation has a transformative impact on law. It examines the field of transnational environmental regulation to show that its proliferation challenges the continued appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> as: (i) territorial, (ii) emanating from the state, (iii) composed of a public and private sphere, (iv) constitutive and regulatory in function, and (v) cohesive and regimented. Instead, law is increasingly perceived as (i) delocalised, (ii) flowing from a plurality of sources, (iii) organisationally inchoate, (iv) reflexive and coordinating in function, and (v) polycentric.
