When they returned, {{they were in}} a terrible state: they had been sewn together, back to back, like Siamese twins. Their wounds were {{infected}} and oozing pus. They screamed day and night. Then their parents—I remember the mother's name was Stella—managed to get some morphine and they killed the children in order to end their suffering.|$|E
25|$|Studies using PET {{have come}} to the same {{conclusions}} regarding the use of the parahippocampal gyrus for prospective memory. The parahippocampal gyrus is activated in paired-associate prospective memory tasks, in which participants must learn a pair of words and be able to <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> half of the word pair in later trials. It is suspected that the parahippocampal gyrus is additionally involved in monitoring the novelty of presented stimuli. If not monitored properly, new stimuli can be distracting during attempts to remember intentions for the future.|$|E

The red {{light of the}} morning sun was streaming upon them as they lay head towards us on the ground.

It was frightful, but it was grotesque, and the red sunlight seemed to paint everything all over. I <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> man had on buckskin breeches.|$|E

Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly was confused by the message presented. She approved of the Will–Emma plot and Holly's departure, but was dismayed {{by the lack of}} Kurt and Blaine, and criticized Mercedes' storyline for its repetitive nature. The Washington Post Lisa de Moraes lambasted the League of Doom plot, which, she wrote, consisted of [...] " [...] whom viewers will barely <b>remember,</b> <b>one</b> who is super creepy, and another who fans despised". She suggested that they were included for contractual, rather than storyline reasons, though lauded Jackson's talent for [...] "steal every scene he's in."

500|$|The RAM in 1866 was in poor {{shape in}} terms of {{influence}} and reputation as well as financially. The critic Henry Chorley published data in that year showing that only 17 per cent of orchestral players in Britain had studied there. No alumni of the RAM {{were members of the}} orchestra at Covent Garden opera house. Chorley added, [...] "I cannot <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> great instrumental player the Academy has turned out during the last 25 years." [...] Bennett himself was not entirely in accord with the emphasis Chorley placed on instrumental training for the RAM; he was concerned (and with reason) that such a policy could mean supply oustripping demand for graduates. Bennett himself taught composition at the RAM; this was undoubtedly where his greatest interests lay at this period, and it appears that the examples he gave to his pupils concentrated on his own 'conservative' favourites of Mendelssohn, Beethoven and Mozart. Nonetheless, the reputation and popularity of the RAM increased markedly under his stewardship. The number of pupils, which had dropped catastrophically at the time when the directors had proposed closing the institution, rose steadily. At the end of 1868 there had been 66 students. By 1870 the number was 121, and by 1872 it was 176.|$|E
500|$|Hergé {{reached a}} {{particularly}} traumatic period {{in his life}} and suffered a mental breakdown. In 1956, he realised that he had fallen out of love with his wife Germaine, whom he had married in 1932, and by 1958, he and Fanny Vlaminck, a colourist at Studios Hergé twenty-eight years his junior, had developed a deep mutual attraction. They began courting; Hergé's new companion lifted his morale and shared many of his interests. Germaine soon began interfering with the courtship, causing Hergé to admit his desire had been to maintain a relationship with both women. When he failed to please either, he began to contemplate divorcing Germaine to marry Fanny. His Catholic upbringing and Boy Scout ethic, however, caused him to feel tremendous guilt. As he later related to interviewer Numa Sadoul: [...] "It meant turning upside down all my values—what a shock! This was a serious moral crisis: I was married, and I loved someone else; life seemed impossible with my wife, {{but on the other hand}} I had this scout-like idea of giving my word for ever. It was a real catastrophe. I was completely torn up." [...] During this period, Hergé had recurrent nightmares where he faced images of what he described as [...] "the beauty and cruelty of white"—visions of white and snow that he could not explain. As he later told Sadoul: [...] "At the time, I was going through a time of real crisis and my dreams were nearly always white dreams. And they were extremely distressing. I took note of them and <b>remember</b> <b>one</b> where I was in a kind of tower made up of a series of ramps. Dead leaves were falling and covering everything. At a particular moment, in an immaculately white alcove, a white skeleton appeared that tried to catch me. And then instantly everything around me became white." ...|$|E
