5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} from transverse and longitudinal steel frames, and {{were divided into}} nine watertight compartments, with a double bottom that extended for 60percent {{of the length of}} the hull. Both vessels had two pole masts fitted with spotting tops. Nautilus and Albatross had different bows; Nautilus received a clipper bow, while Albatross had a <b>ram</b> <b>bow</b> like contemporary German light cruisers. Albatross also had a higher forecastle that extended {{to the base of the}} main mast, while Nautilus was completed with a superstructure deck that began just aft of the fore mast.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, San Martino {{collided}} with Regina Maria Pia {{and had her}} <b>ram</b> <b>bow</b> twisted, causing leaks in her hull. Shortly thereafter, Persano broke off the engagement to consolidate his forces, but his ships, low on coal and ammunition, and with badly demoralized crews, could not be rallied by Persano's half-hearted attempt to launch an attack. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; as night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. San Martino had been hit numerous times, and had her side armor penetrated by one shell, which {{did not succeed in}} penetrating the timber backing. Twice during the engagement, the ship was set on fire by Austrian shells, though her crew was able to put the fires out. After the battle, Vacca replaced Persano; he was ordered to attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out.|$|E

50|$|The {{importance}} of ramming {{in the battle}} led to naval designers, over the next 50 years, equipping future warships (especially battleships and cruisers) with <b>ram</b> <b>bows.</b> This aggravated a number of incidents of ships being sunk by their squadron-mates in accidental collisions. Ramming never featured as a viable battle tactic again. The fixation on ramming may also have inhibited the development of gunnery.|$|R
25|$|In 1899, the Italian Navy ordered six destroyers {{from the}} German {{shipyard}} Schichau-Werke of Elbing, Prussia (now Elbląg in Poland). The design was typical for Schichau-designed destroyers of the period, with a raised turtleback forecastle, a <b>ram</b> <b>bow</b> and two funnels.|$|E

2500|$|The Civil War {{occurred}} {{during the early stages}} of the industrial revolution and subsequently many naval innovations emerged during this time, most notably the advent of the ironclad warship. It began when the Confederacy, knowing they had to meet or match the Union's naval superiority, responded to the Union blockade by building or converting more than 130 vessels, including twenty-six ironclads and floating batteries. Only half of these saw active service. Many were equipped with <b>ram</b> <b>bows,</b> creating [...] "ram fever" [...] among Union squadrons wherever they threatened. But in the face of overwhelming Union superiority and the Union's own ironclad warships, they were unsuccessful.|$|R

In its first two years the Rams fielded a Reserve Grade side in the Sydney District Football Association, playing before Hawkesbury's First Grade matches and using that club's home grounds at firstly Deerubbun Park, Windsor and then Colbee Park, McGrath's Hill. In their first season, the <b>Rams</b> <b>bowed</b> out in the Preliminary Final, but had individual honour winners in Keith Claxton (McFarlane Medal) and Peter Traeger (SDFA Reserve Grade Leading Goalkicker) - Peter had also kicked the Reserve Grade record of 11 goals in a game during the season, which stood for 26 years until broken by Jason Ware in 2006.|$|R

50|$|The {{frequent}} use of ramming as a tactic in the Battle of Lissa (1866) and, to a lesser extent, at the Battle of Iquique also led to many late 19th-century naval designers equipping their warships with <b>ram</b> <b>bows.</b> This only really aggravated a number of incidents of ships being sunk by their squadron-mates in accidental collisions as ramming never featured as a viable battle tactic again. The fixation on ramming may also have inhibited the development of gunnery. When it became clear, {{toward the end of}} the 19th century, that breech-loading cannon could effectively hit enemy ships at several thousand yards range, the ineffectiveness of the ram became clear and ships ceased to be fitted with them. Battleships and cruisers, instead, had inverted bows which superficially resembled rams. These were not, however, reinforced, and were fitted in order to improve ship speed by increasing the waterline length. They also served to decrease the length of forecastle that was exposed to muzzle flash when the guns were fired directly ahead.|$|R
