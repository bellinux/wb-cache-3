40|$|Lead {{extrusion}} dampers {{have been}} used to dissipate seismic energy in structures and can contribute to damage avoidance design (DAD) rocking connections. In rocking connections that utilises unbound post-tensioned tendons, re-centering of the overall structure is typical. However, the lead extrusion dampers alone are strictly dissipative, have no inherent self-centering and without careful integration into a structural system can lead to residual story drifts. In this study a modified version of High Force-To Volume (HF 2 V) extrusion damper is introduced to overcome the lack of inherent re-centring, while maintaining the energy absorption capability. The new device is a combination of HF 2 V and <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> dampers to provide an overall device with large energy dissipation and inherent self-centering. Response spectral analysis for multiple, probabilistically scaled earthquake suites are used to delineate the displacement reduction factors due to the added damping. Hysteresis analysis of the device under a variety of seismic loadings are also performed and design plots are provided for different sized dampers. Overall, the results indicate an important trade-off between force contributions from the HF 2 V and <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> components. Moreover, increasing the <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> participation force level leads to less residual displacement in exchange for less reduction in peak displacement. This approach of larger <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> contributions shows less dependence on the structural period, indicating a robustness of the design to a broad spectrum of ground motion inputs...|$|E
40|$|Ring springs are {{frictional}} devices {{consisting of}} {{inner and outer}} ring elements assembled to form a spring stack. External load applied to the spring produces sliding action across mating ring interfaces. Large amounts of energy, as much as 60 - 70 % of the total cycle energy, may be absorbed in overcoming frictional forces. This thesis details the characteristics and dynamic behaviour of <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> systems and describes the design and testing of a seismic isolation system that uses ring springs. Initially the characteristics and fundamental dynamic behaviour of single-degree-of-freedom mass/ring spring systems are studied. This study uses a model based upon the non-linear force/deflection characteristics of the <b>ring</b> <b>spring.</b> A prototype <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> cartridge that enables dynamic inputs {{to be applied to}} a <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> was then designed and subjected to short duration shock excitation. Experimental results are compared with those given by computer simulation and are seen to be in good agreement. Ring springs have been identified as suitable devices for use in earthquake-resistant structures. A particularly attractive candidate for use of ring springs is in protecting columnar structures during earthquakes. To enable further study, a pivotal rocking seismic isolation system was developed. So that computational analyses of these systems could be undertaken, the <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> model has been incorporated within the computer program RUAUMOKO. Dynamic analyses using RUAUMOKO show that pivotal rocking isolation systems can significantly reduce structural loads during short period type earthquakes. Subsequently, a pivotal rocking seismic isolation system was designed and manufactured. Shaker table tests were then carried out on the rocking system for a range of earthquake inputs. The experimental results show that for columnar structures with fundamental periods in the range of dominant spectral accelerations, structural loads can be significantly reduced during short period type earthquakes. Experimental results compare well with those given by computer simulation, thus confirming the effectiveness of the isolation system. The work outlined in this thesis has established a basis from which further research can be undertaken. The pivotal rocking seismic isolation system developed has potential application to protecting a wide range of columnar structures during short period type earthquakes...|$|E

40|$|Shape memory alloys (SMAs) have {{recently}} emerged as promising material candidates for structural seismic resisting purposes. Most {{of the existing}} SMA-based strategies, however, {{are based on the}} wire or rod form of SMAs, where issues such as gripping complexity and fracture may exist. This paper presents a proof-of-concept study on an innovative type of SMA-based self-centring system, namely, a superelastic SMA <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> system. The proposed system includes a series of inner high-strength steel (HSS) rings and outer superelastic SMA rings stacked in alternation with mating taper faces, where the resisting load is provided by the wedging action which tends to expand the outer rings and concurrently to squeeze the inner rings. The superelastic effect of the SMA offers energy dissipation and a driving force for recentring, and the frictional effect over the taper face further contributes to the overall resisting load and energy dissipation. The feasibility of the new system is carefully examined via numerical studies considering the parameters of ring thickness, taper angle, and coefficient of friction. The key hysteretic responses, including resisting load, stiffness, stress distributions, source of residual deformation, energy dissipation, and equivalent viscous damping, are discussed in detail. The behaviour of the SMA ring springs is also studied via analytical models, and the analytical predictions are found to agree well with the numerical results. Finally, two practical applications of the new system, namely self-centring HS-SMA <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> connections, and self-centring SMA <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> dampers, are discussed via comprehensive numerical studies.

40|$|Abstract: A shift force {{simulator}} for {{manual transmission}} is developed {{to estimate the}} shift force that is transmitted to the driver’s hand. In order to develop the simulator, dynamic models of the external linkage, internal linkage, synchronizer and drivetrain are obtained. The synchronizing motion is modelled as seven steps depending on {{the relative displacement of}} the sleeve to the <b>ring</b> <b>spring,</b> outer ring chamfer and gear chamfer. The chamfer-to-chamfer contact mechanism is modelled as a linear spring. In addition, a driver model is proposed to simulate the driver’s shift lever operation. Based on the dynamic model of each element, a shift force simulator is developed. The simulator calculates the sleeve displacement, cone torque, index torque, sleeve force, shift force and the speed of the input and output shaft. It is found that the shift force by the simulator shows a good correlation with the test results, and it is expected that the shift force simulator developed in this study {{can be used as a}} useful design tool to evaluate the shift feeling in the initial design stage...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{relationship}} between inelastic deformation and energy dissipation in structures that are subjected to earthquake ground motions. Thus, if seismic energy dissipation {{can be achieved by}} means of a separate non-load bearing supplementary damping system, the load bearing structure can remain elastic with continuing serviceability following the design level earthquake. This research was carried out to investigate the advantages of using added damping in structures. The control system consists of passive friction dampers called <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> dampers installed in the ground floor of the structure using a tendon to transmit the forces to the other parts of the structure. The ring springs dampers are friction devices consisting of inner and outer ring elements assembled to form a spring stack. External load applied to the spring produces sliding action across mating ring interfaces. The damping forces generated by the dampers and transferred in the supplemental system to the structure by the tendon and horizontal links oppose the internal loads. A four storey-two bay steel frame structure was used in the study. Experimental and analytical studies to investigate the effectiveness of a supplemental control system are presented. The model was subjected to a series of earthquake simulations on the shaking table in the Structural Laboratory of the Civil Engineering Department, at the University of Canterbury. The earthquake simulation tests have been performed on the structure both with and without the supplemental control system. The earthquake simulations were a series of gradually increasing intensity replications of two commonly used earthquake records. This thesis includes detailed description of the structural model, the supplemental control system, the ring springs dampers and the data obtained during the testing. Analyses were then carried out on a twelve storey framed structure to investigate the possible tendon arrangements and the size and type of dampers required to control the response of a real building. Guidelines for determining the appropriateness of including a supplemental damping system have been investigated. The main features of the supplemental control system adopted in this research are: • It is a passive control system with extreme reliability and having no dependence on external power sources to effect the control action. These power sources may not be available during a major earthquake. • Ring springs are steel friction devices capable of absorbing large amounts of input energy. No liquid leakage can occur and minimal maintenance is required for the <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> dampers. • With a damper-tendon system, the distribution of the dampers throughout the structure is not so critical. Only one or two dampers are used to produce the damping forces needed, and forces are then transferred {{to the rest of the}} building by the tendon system. • It is a relatively inexpensive control system with a long useful life...|$|E

The hotter conditions resulted in an earlier onset of cambial activity and all differentiation phases of about 20 days, resulting in an increased duration of xylogenesis of about 23 days. Air and stem temperatures at which xylogenesis had a 0. 5 probability of being active were calculated with logistic regressions fitted on binary responses. In both years, similar thresholds were estimated with daily mean values of 8. 2 and 9. 5 °C for air and stem temperatures, respectively. The observed convergent responses of cambium phenology to temperature during the two contrasting springs confirm the key role of this environmental factor in determining the onset and duration of wood formation in timberline areas. The intra-annual dynamics of ring-width increase differed between years, with significantly narrower rings formed in 2004 than in 2003. These differences were mainly related to cell size because larger early wood tracheids were produced in 2003.

In a common oiling system, oil is drawn out of the oil sump (oil pan, in US English) through a wire mesh strainer that removes {{some of the larger}} pieces of debris from the oil.

Many of the improvements learnt from the Cooper-tuned units were also incorporated, with A-Plus engines having a generally higher standard of metallurgy on all units, where previously only the highest-tuned engines were upgraded in this way. This made the A-Plus engines generally longer-lived than the standard A-Series, which had a life between major rebuilds of around 80,000 to 100,000 miles in normal service.
