Many such missions will be located far outside the radius of the GPS constellation. So in such missions {{it will not be}} possible to derive position knowledge through the capabilities afforded by the GPS service. Consequently, in such missions, it is necessary to determine relative positions by other means. Depending on how well a position must be known, thus far it has appeared necessary to use means other than <b>RF</b> <b>ranging,</b> due to technical limitations.

Acaricides continue to be sold indiscriminately, and this has contributed towards making the problem of resistance widespread, thus making diagnosis and monitoring of tick resistance essential. Here, bioassays (larval packet test) were performed on tick populations from the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Mato Grosso do Sul regarding their susceptibility to cypermethrin, deltamethrin and flumethrin. All the tick samples tested showed resistance to cypermethrin (10) (resistance factor (<b>RF)</b> <b>ranging</b> from 5. 6 to 80. 3) and deltamethrin (10) (<b>RF</b> <b>ranging</b> from 2. 4 to 83. 1).

50|$|Neural {{and muscle}} cells are {{electric}}ally-excitable, i.e. {{they can be}} stimulated by electric current. In human patients such stimulation may cause acute pain, muscle spasms, and even cardiac arrest.

Stimulation threshold does not vary much at low frequencies (so called rheobase-constant level). However, the threshold starts increasing with decreasing duration of a pulse (or a cycle) when it drops below a characteristic minimum (so called chronaxie). Typically, chronaxie of neural cells is in the range of 0.1-10 ms, so the sensitivity to electrical stimulation (inverse of the stimulation threshold) decreases with increasing frequency in the kHz range and above.

A drawback of the Oudin coil was that movement of the electrode and wire during use changed the capacitance of the top terminal of the secondary coil, and thus its resonant frequency.
