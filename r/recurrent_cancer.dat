40|$|Surgery is the {{preferred}} modality for curative treatment of <b>recurrent</b> laryngeal <b>cancer</b> after failure of nonsurgical treatments. Patients with initial early-stage cancer experiencing recurrence following radiotherapy often have more advanced-stage tumors {{by the time the}} recurrence is recognized. About one third of such <b>recurrent</b> <b>cancers</b> are suitable for conservation surgery. Endoscopic resection with the CO(2) laser or open partial laryngectomy (partial vertical, supracricoid, or supraglottic laryngectomies) have been used. The outcomes of conservation surgery appear better than those after total laryngectomy, because of selection bias. Transoral laser surgery is currently used more frequently than open partial laryngectomy for treatment of early-stage recurrence, with outcomes equivalent to open surgery but with less associated morbidity. Laser surgery has also been employed for selective cases of advanced recurrent disease, but patient selection and expertise are required for application of this modality to rT 3 tumors.

ResultsIn the mass range (Mr) from 1 000 to 12 000 Da, eight differentially expressed protein peaks were screened from primary ovarian cancer serum. Among them, four protein peaks with Mr 1 457, 1 857, 2 202, 7 761 were lowly expressed and the others with Mr 2 946, 5 333, 5 859, 5 901 were highly expressed. Ten diferentially expressed protein peaks were screened from <b>recurrent</b> ovarian <b>cancer</b> serum. Among them, 1 944, 1 980, 2 080, 2 661, 2 993, 4 450, 4 659, 5 359 Da protein expressions were increased significantly, and 1897, 7868 Da protein expressions were decreased significantly. The pattern of primary ovarian cancer was applied to 8 early-stage ovarian cancer serum samples, and 7 serum samples were successfully predicted with the accuracy of 87. 5 %.

In a previous report, we showed that recurrent PTC with no radioiodine ((131) I) uptake are frequently associated with BRAF mutations, a low expression of thyroid-related genes and a high expression of glucose type- 1 transporter gene. AIM: The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess BRAF status in a large series of recurrent PTC patients, considering paired primary and <b>recurrent</b> <b>cancers.</b> The BRAF genotype was correlated with the ability to concentrate (131) I and/or 2 -[(18) F]fluoro- 2 -deoxi-d-glucose ((18) F-FDG) in the <b>recurrent</b> <b>cancers,</b> serum markers of recurrence, and patient outcome. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 50 PTC patients with recurrent cervical disease submitted to a re-intervention, followed up in median for 9 years. BRAF analysis was conducted by direct sequencing and mutant allele-specific PCR amplification. In 18 cases, molecular analysis was also assessed in the primary cancer.

40|$|Background: The {{management}} of <b>recurrent</b> rectal <b>cancer</b> is challenging. At {{the present time}} pelvic exenteration with en bloc sacrectomy offers the only hope of lasting cure. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate clinical outcome measures and complication rates following sacrectomy for <b>recurrent</b> rectal <b>cancer.</b> Data Sources: Search conducted on âPub Medâ for English language articles relevant to sacrectomy for <b>recurrent</b> rectal <b>cancer</b> with no time limitations. Study Selection: Studies reported sacrectomy with survival data for recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma. Main outcome measure: Disease free survival following sacrectomy for <b>recurrent</b> rectal <b>cancer.</b> Results: A total of 220 <b>recurrent</b> rectal <b>cancer</b> patients were included from 7 studies, of which 160 were male and 60 were female. Overall median operative time was 717 (570 - 992) minutes and blood loss was 3. 7 (1. 7 - 6. 2) litres. An R 0 (> 1 mm resection margin) resection was achieved in 78 % of patients. Disease free survival associated with R 0 resection was 55 % at a median follow up period of 33 (17 - 60) months; however, none of the patients with R 1 (< 1 mm resection margin) survived this period. Postoperative complication rates and median length of stay were found to decrease with more distal sacral transection levels. In contrast, R 1 resection rates increased with more distal transection. Limitation: The studies assessed by this review were retrospective case series and thus are subject to significant bias. Conclusion: Sacrectomy performed for patients with <b>recurrent</b> rectal <b>cancer</b> is associated with significant postoperative morbidity. Morbidity and post-operative length of stay increase with the level of sacral transection. Nevertheless, approximately half of patients eligible for rectal excision with en bloc sacrectomy may benefit from disease free survival for up to 33 months, with R 0 resection predicting disease free survival in the medium term...|$|R
