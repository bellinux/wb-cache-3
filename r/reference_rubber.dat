40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{deals with}} the {{modification}} of the mineral filler based on clinoptilolite by the silanization process and application of prepared modified forms into polymeric materials. Zeolite clinoptilolite is natural aluminosilicate material with the special porous structure belonging to zeolite group. Surface modification of clinoptilolite was performed with 3 -(aminopropyl) triethoxysilane. The influence of silanization conditions – time (1, 2 and 3 hours) and temperature (20 °C and 50 °C) on the efficiency of clinoptilolite modification was studied. Prepared modified fillers were mixed into rubber compounds as partial replacement of commonly used filler – carbon black. Influence of prepared fillers on rheoloy and vulcanizing characteristics of rubber compounds and also on physical and mechanical properties, crosslink density and termooxidative ageing of the vulcanizates was studied. Obtained results of measured characteristics of polymeric systems containing filler based on clinoptilolite were compared with the results obtained {{in the case of}} <b>reference</b> <b>rubber</b> compound with a commercially used filler – carbon black. Based on the results the influence of silanization conditions of clinoptilolite filler on its efficiency in polymeric systems has been determined...|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} <b>references</b> to <b>rubber</b> in Europe {{appears to be in}} 1770, when Edward Nairne was selling cubes of natural rubber at his shop at 20 Cornhill. The cubes, meant to be erasers, sold for the astonishingly high price of 3 shillings per half-inch cube. Nairne is credited with creating the first rubber eraser. Prior to using rubber, breadcrumbs were used as erasers. Nairne says he inadvertently picked up a piece of rubber instead of breadcrumbs, discovered its erasing properties, and began selling rubber erasers.|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{three kinds}} of {{silicone}} rubber based composite materials, SIR, NSIR and DSIR, were prepared. SIR is the <b>reference</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> without addition of antimicrobial biocide. Two different antimicrobial agents at a concentration of 3 wt% {{were added to the}} <b>reference</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> to form the other two types of materials. The materials were inoculated with a fungal spore suspension containing nutrients. Fungal growth could be observed visually in form of spots by naked eye, and biofilm was formed and detected by SEM observation on the surfaces of SIR and NSIR samples, whereas DSIR samples were completely free of the fungal growth. Then the electrical performance of both clean and biofilm contaminated samples, including the surface and volume conductivity, surface flashover voltage and leakage current before flashover, were measured. The obtained results indicate that as compared with SIR base material, the biocides have not changed the surface conductivity and surface flashover voltage of NSIR and DSIR materials. At the same time, the volume conductivity of NSIR remains almost the same as SIR, while that of DSIR increases by about two orders of magnitude. Biofilm could increase the surface conductivity and decrease the surface flashover voltage significantly. The time domain and frequency domain analyses of the leakage currents flowing before flashover event provide useful information on the severity of contamination by biofilm and the eventual risk for surface flashover...|$|R

40|$|Latex exploitation-caused latex flow is {{effective}} in enhancing latex regeneration in laticifer cells of rubber tree. It should be suitable for screening appropriate reference gene for analysis of the expression of latex regeneration-related genes by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In the present study, the expression stability of 23 candidate reference genes was evaluated {{on the basis of}} latex flow by using geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. Ubiquitin-protein ligase 2 a (UBC 2 a) and ubiquitin-protein ligase 2 b (UBC 2 b) were the two most stable genes among the selected candidate <b>references</b> in <b>rubber</b> tree clones with differential duration of latex flow. The two genes were also high-ranked in previous reference gene screening across different tissues and experimental conditions. By contrast, the transcripts of latex regeneration-related genes fluctuated significantly during latex flow. The results suggest that screening reference gene during latex flow should be an efficient and effective clue for selection of reference genes in qRT-PCR...|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of The Rubber Research of Malaysia (RRIM) in 1925 has started {{the research and}} development in various aspects related to rubber improvement in Malaysia. Many improvement programmes have been carried out to develop high yielding rubber clones and favourable characters such as low disease incident and wind resistance clones. For almost 90 years, RRIM has introduced the rubber planting recommendations to benefit rubber growers, plantations and smallholdings with the latest observations, evaluations and results obtained from the experimental trials. Rubber planting recommendations produced by RRIM has become the main <b>reference</b> for <b>rubber</b> growers over the years to gather the latest information of high yielding clones that available in Malaysia. There are continuously updated information related to rubber clones presented in the planting recommendations but prior to 1957 there are not much information disseminated through RRIM's internal reports and articles. Therefore, this review summarize the overview of RRIM rubber planting recommendations since 1925 and its impacts to the rubber growers in Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} the static {{stability}} of the uniform Timoshenko column in presence of multiple cracks, subjected to tensile or compressive loads, is analyzed. The governing differential equations are formulated by modeling the cracks as concentrated reductions of the flexural stiffness, accomplished {{by the use of}} Dirac’s delta distributions. The adopted model has allowed the derivation of the exact buckling modes and the corresponding buckling load equations of the Timoshenko multi-cracked column, as a function of four integration constant only, which are derived simply by enforcing the end boundary conditions, irrespective of the number of concentrated damage. Since shear deformability has been taken into account, the buckling load equation allows capturing both compressive and tensile buckling. The latter phenomenon has been recently investigated with <b>reference</b> to <b>rubber</b> bearing isolators, modeled as short beams, but it has been shown to occur also in slender beams characterized by high distributed shear deformation, like composite and layered beams. The influence of multiple concentrated cracks on the stability of shear deformable beams, particularly under the action of tensile loads, has never been assessed in the literature and is here addressed on the basis of an extensive parametric analysis. All the reported results have been compared with the Euler multi-cracked column in order to highlight its limits of applicability...|$|R
