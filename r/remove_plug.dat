50|$|Modular {{connectors}} {{are designed}} to latch together. A spring-loaded tab on the plug snaps into a jack so that the plug cannot be pulled out. To <b>remove</b> the <b>plug,</b> the latching tab must be depressed. The standard and most common way to install a jack in a wall or panel is with the tab side down. This usually {{makes it easier to}} operate the tab when <b>removing</b> the <b>plug,</b> because the person grabs the plug with thumb on top and presses the tab up with the index finger. This orientation is recommended by manufacturers because any dust or fine abrasive or conductive particles that may enter an unused jack will tend to fall away from the electrical contacts, rather than settling onto the contact surfaces.|$|R
30|$|The rotary {{water jetting}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} techniques for horizontal well cleanup. The jet flow is used to <b>remove</b> <b>plugging</b> particles from sand control screens to recover their permeability. Currently, the operation optimization of this technique depends mainly on experience due to absence of applicable evaluation and design models for <b>removing</b> <b>plugging</b> materials. This paper presents an experimental setup to simulate the cleanup process of plugged screens by rotary water jetting on the surface and to evaluate the performance of a jetting tool. Using real plugged screens pulled from damaged wells, a series of tests were performed, and the qualitative relationships between the cleanup efficiency and various operational parameters, such as the type of fluids used, flow rate, mode of tool movement, etc., were obtained. The test results indicated that the cleanup performance was much better when the rotary jetting tool moved and stopped periodically for a certain time than that when it reciprocated at a constant speed. To be exact, it was desirable for the rotary jetting tool to move for 1.5 – 2 m and stop for 2 – 4 min, which was called the “move-stop-move” mode. Good cleanup performance could be obtained at high flow rates, and the flow rate was recommended to be no lower than 550 – 600 L/min. The test results also indicated that complex mud acid was better than clean water in terms of cleanup performance. Good cleanup efficiency and high screen permeability recovery could be achieved for severely plugged screens. Rotary jetting is preferred for the cleanup of horizontal wells with severely plugged screens, and the screen permeability recovery ratio may reach 20 % if optimized operation parameters were used.|$|R

25|$|This slip {{is poured}} into the space between plaster of Paris molds. The toilet bowl, rim, tank and tank lid require {{separate}} molds. The molds are assembled and set up for filling and the slip-filled molds sit {{for about an hour}} after filling. This allows the plaster molds to absorb moisture from the slip, which makes it semisolid next to the mold surfaces but lets it remain liquid further {{from the surface of the}} molds. Then, the workers <b>remove</b> <b>plugs</b> to allow any excess liquid slip to drain from the cavities of the mold (this excess slip is recycled for later use). The drained-out slip leaves hollow voids inside the fixture, using less material to keep it both lighter and easier to fire in a kiln. This molding process allows the formation of intricate internal waste lines in the fixture; the drain's hollow cavities are poured out as slip.|$|R

40|$|Summary. Functions {{suggested}} for stomatal plugs (occlusion of the stomatal pore by wax or cutin) include: reduction of water loss, protection against insects and fungi, preventing entry {{of water into}} stomatal pores and preventing {{the formation of a}} water film on leaves. By <b>removing</b> <b>plugs</b> experimentally, we investigated their impact on gas exchange, cuticular water loss and water film formation in the rain forest tree, Agathis robusta. The results showed that under saturating PFD, waxy plugs significantly decreased stomatal conductance, transpiration and photosynthesis in A. robusta in contrast to the results of Feild et al. (1998) for D. winteri. Although most species in dry environments lack stomatal plugs, in alpine regions where conifers commonly grow, seasonal soil-water deficit occurs when soil is frozen, and the leaves can still be exposed to dry air and high sunlight (Roberts, 2000). This might explain the presence of stomatal plugs in some of conifer species. The present results also showed that stomatal plugs did not affect the formation of a water film on leaf surfaces of A. robusta. This result was again in contrast _____________ *Corresponding author...|$|R

5|$|In most rodent species, such as brown {{rats and}} house mice, {{ovulation}} occurs {{on a regular}} cycle while in others, such as voles, it is induced by mating. During copulation, males of some rodent species deposit a mating plug in the female's genital opening, both to prevent sperm leakage and to protect against other males inseminating the female. Females can <b>remove</b> the <b>plug</b> and may do so either immediately or after several hours.|$|R
50|$|The lees {{removal process}} is called {{disgorging}} (dégorgement in French), traditionally a skilled manual process where the crown cap and lees are removed without losing {{much of the}} liquid, and a varying amount of sugar added.

Modern automated disgorgement is done by freezing {{a small amount of}} the liquid in the neck and <b>removing</b> this <b>plug</b> of ice containing the lees.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{we found}} that the <b>removed</b> mesh <b>plug</b> and the onlay mesh {{slightly}} shrunk compared to their original size but not stiffened as reported [2] and with no granulation attracted (Figure  3 c). This suggests that the penetration into the bladder might have occurred far earlier, and the wet environment prevented the mesh from becoming stiffened and from developing granulation. Perhaps, a genitourinary infection has occurred at a later point of time, and the mesh was then infected.|$|R

40|$|Both {{males and}} females of the spider Leucauge mariana (Taczanowski 1881) {{contribute}} material to the plugs that often occlude the genital openings of females in the field. Males were sometimes unable to remove or penetrate these plugs, but overcame others using three different mechanical mechanisms: snag the plug and pull it off; break and penetrate through it; and break its adhesion to the epigynum by injecting material under it. They used their genitalia to accomplish these tasks, {{despite the fact that}} the genital bulb lacks muscles and innervation, thus limiting the male's ability to guide genital movements precisely. The effects of two male genital structures, the conductor tip and the conductor hook on sperm transfer and genital plug removal were tested by direct observations of their morphology and behavior, and by experimental removal of structures from one but not the other palp of the same male. Removal of the conductor tip reduced sperm transfer, while removal of both the hook and the conductor reduced plug removal. A preliminary characterization of palp movements and their sequences did not reveal any behavior that seemed especially designed for <b>removing</b> <b>plugs,</b> as opposed to inseminating the female. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|To histomorphometrically {{investigate}} the repair of critical size defects (CSDs) and bone augmentation in cranial walls using block of sintered bovine-derived anorganic bone (sBDAB) graft. Forty guinea-pigs {{were divided into}} test (n= 20) and CSD control (n= 20) groups. In each animal, a full-thickness bone defect with 9. 5 mm diameter {{was made in the}} frontal bone. The defects were filled with an sBDAB block soaked in blood in the test group and with blood clot in the CSD control group. The skulls were collected at 0 h (n= 2) and 30, 90 and 180 days (n= 6 /group and period) postoperatively. The volume density and total volume of newly formed bone, sBDAB, blood vessels and connective tissue, vertical thickness of <b>removed</b> bone <b>plug,</b> sBDAB block and graft area were evaluated. The vertical thickness of the adapted sBDAB block was 3. 8 times higher than that of the <b>removed</b> bone <b>plug</b> and did not show significant difference between periods, filling in average 29. 8 % of the total graft region. The sBDAB block exhibited complete osseointegration with the borders of the defect at 90 days. At 90 and 180 days, the vertical thickness of the graft was 279 % in the average, and the total volume of bone augmentation was, respectively, 78. 8 % and 148. 5 % higher compared with the <b>removed</b> bone <b>plug.</b> The defects of the CDS control group showed limited osteogenesis and filling by connective tissue plus tegument. The sBDAB block can be used to promote repair of CSDs and bone augmentation in the craniomaxillofacial region, due to its good osteoconductive and slow resorptive properties.
