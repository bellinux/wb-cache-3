William Langland wrote the poem Piers Plowman {{in the years before}} 1380, praising peasants who {{respected}} the law and worked hard for their lords, but complaining about greedy, travelling labourers demanding higher wages. The poet John Gower feared England might see an uprising similar to the French Jacquerie revolt of 1358, in which the peasants had risen up against their masters. There was a moral panic about the threat posed by newly arrived workers in the towns and the possibility that servants might turn against their masters. New legislation was introduced in 1359 to deal with migrants, existing conspiracy laws were more widely applied and the treason laws were extended to include servants or wives who betrayed their masters and husbands. By the 1370s, there were fears that if the French invaded England, the <b>rural</b> <b>classes</b> might side with the invaders.|$|E

The salon and its male participants, many of whom were well-known intellectuals, provided them with a means in which to express their ideas and opinions in private, whilst accessing the male-dominant public sphere through their lively discussions and debates. In her thesis entitled 'Arab Women Going Public: Mayy Ziyadah and her Literary Salon in a Comparative Context', Boutheina Khaldi remarks that women of the salons overcame the obstacle of gender inequality [...] "by bringing public men into their private salons and hence creating a public sphere from the very heart of the private one."

40|$|Drawing on Bourdieusian social theory, {{the paper}} {{combines}} class and social constructionist perspectives to reconceptualize youth’s rural-to-urban migration. It discusses how structural properties of everyday lives, e. g. <b>class</b> background, inform <b>rural</b> youth’s evaluations of rurality, {{and how these}} evaluations generate specific rural/urban residential preferences and migration practices. The theoretical discussion is informed by a survey study among rural teenagers in a remote rural region in Norway – the Mountain Region. The results show significant correspondence between informants’ location in the <b>rural</b> <b>class</b> structure as measured by parents’ economic/cultural capital resources and occupation, their evaluations of rurality and, finally, their preferences along the rural–urban dimension for a future place to live. The findings indicate that the social background of rural youth has a greater influence on migration decisions than has been acknowledged in contemporary and predominantly social-constructionist rural migration research. Thus, the paper advocates a theoretical framework that conceptualizes the migration decisions of rural youth as resulting from individualized and free choices, but still structured by predispositions of their <b>rural</b> <b>class</b> habitus...|$|R

However, the <b>rural</b> <b>classes</b> continued to be preponderant in the national population. In the centre of Spain, peasants comprised 80% of the active population (Lynch, p. 236), and most of them were poor and malnourished. The standard of living of the common people continued being very low due to maldistribution of resources. Much of what they could earn was taken in rent, other payments to the landowners, and debt payments (Lynch, p. 5). The worst living conditions for peasants were found in Andalucía, which contained the highest proportion of landless rural labourers (jornaleros). Here, the labourers survived only by the work of women and children, by searching for discarded food, and with the aid of charity.|$|E

Sponsorship: postgraduate research studentship provided by Aberystwyth UniversityIn part prompted by a recent spate of media reports this paper explores {{the emergence of a}} ?new squirearchy? in the English countryside. In doing so, it aims to both illuminate a particular facet of rural social life and help reignite interest in the cultures of <b>rural</b> <b>class.</b> Whilst relationships between <b>rural</b> <b>class</b> and culture were a source of excitement during the 1990 s, much of this interest has apparently spluttered if not died, despite class itself remaining very much a live issue for rural dwellers. The paper draws on the findings of an in-depth ethnographic study to highlight the significance of performance and symbolic boundary-marking in the construction and reproduction of social identity. The focus is the activities and sites of ?the pub?, ?the hunt? and ?the shoot?, which have been key in the emergence of the new squirearchy in the study area. The paper shows the importance of lay classifications based on evaluations of cultural (in) competence and morality, and suggests that the performance and boundary-marking of the new squirearchy in tandem with other identities is evidence of a more extensive, complex and ambiguous ?culture of middle-classness? in rural areas.
