50|$|Film Daily {{was best}} known for its annual year-end critics' poll, in which {{hundreds}} of professional movie critics from around the country submitted their votes for the best films of the year, which the magazine then tallied and published as a top ten list. It was not uncommon for a film to win for a year that actually came after the year it first premiered, since the <b>rollover</b> <b>date</b> for each year's eligibility cycle was typically November 1 and the film was required to be in general release. Gone with the Wind, for example, premiered in 1939 but didn't become eligible until 1941 when it switched from a roadshow format to a general release. No winner was named in 1950 because for that year only, separate categories were polled for Drama of the Year and Musical of the Year (won by Sunset Boulevard and Annie Get Your Gun, respectively).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{discusses}} how to {{roll over}} European Union Allowances (EUAs) and Certified Emissions Reduction (CERs) futures contracts with different maturities. The aim is to elucidate {{whether or not the}} choice of <b>rollover</b> <b>date</b> is important when constructing EUAs and CERs continuous futures time series. We have applied five different methodologies to link the series and our findings indicate that return distributions do not significantly differ for the different criteria. This result has direct practical implications in the field of applied econometrics of carbon markets given that we prove that the selection of the simple last-day rollover methodology criterion has no downside {{not only in terms of}} returns distribution but also with respect to liquidity levels...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new dynamic bank run model for {{liquidity}} risk where {{a financial institution}} finances its risky assets by a mixture of short- and long-term debt. The financial institution is exposed to insolvency risk at any time until maturity and to illiquidity risk at {{a finite number of}} <b>rollover</b> <b>dates.</b> We compute both insolvency and illiquidity default probabilities in this multiperiod setting using a structural credit risk model approach. Firesale rates can be determined endogenously as expected debt value over current asset value. Numerical results illustrate the impact of various input parameters on the default probabilities. © The Authors 2013...|$|R

This article is a starting point {{to answer that question}} and is composed of two parts; an historical background on K&E’s serial number philosophy by Clark, and the methods used in determining the serial number series <b>rollover</b> <b>dates</b> and slide rule dating by Richard. The six digit numbers found on K&E slide rules after 1922 have been referred to as “serial numbers”. Some people do not like to call them serial numbers since the numbers roll over at 999, 999 and start over at 1; therefore, the numbers are not unique. This rollover of the numbers complicates using them to estimate a production date for a given rule. The numbers appear to have started in 1922 an...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} unified {{structural}} credit risk model incorporating both insolvency and illiquidity risks, {{in order to}} investigate how a firm's default probability depends on the liquidity risk associated with its financing structure. We assume the firm finances its risky assets by mainly issuing short- and long-term debt. Short-term debt can have either a discrete or a more realistic staggered tenor structure. At <b>rollover</b> <b>dates</b> of short-term debt, creditors face a dynamic coordination problem. We show that a unique threshold strategy (i. e., a debt run barrier) exists for short-term creditors to decide when to withdraw their funding, and this strategy {{is closely related to}} the solution of a non-standard optimal stopping time problem with control constraints. We decompose the total credit risk into an insolvency component and an illiquidity component based on such an endogenous debt run barrier together with an exogenous insolvency barrier.

40|$|Learning Management Systems (LMSs) {{have become}} a larger part of {{teaching}} and learning in the modern world. Therefore has Moodle, a free and open source e-learning tool surfaced and gained a lot of attraction and downloads. A purpose of this study has been to develop a new local plugin in Moodle with guidelines from Magnus Eriksson and Tsedey Terefe. A purpose for this project has also been to build a plugin which has the functions <b>Date</b> <b>rollover</b> and Individual <b>date</b> adjustment. Mid Sweden University (Miun) stated that WebCT/Blackboard was in use before Moodle and some other LMSs and the dissatisfaction with WebCT/Blackboard was rife, however some teachers liked it. Therefore WebCT/Blackboard was abandoned and Moodle was embraced. The methods of gaining information has generally been web based sources and three interviews, likewise called user tests. Programs and other aids that have been used include but are not limited to: Google Drive, LTI Provider, Moodle, Moodle documentation, Notepad++, PHP and XAMPP. The plugin has been implemented as a local plugin. The result has shown that the coded plugin, Date adjustment tools could be improved and that it was changed. In the plugin, support for old American English dates were added and the code for using the two functions “Date rollover” and “Individual date adjustment” were rewritten to not interfere with one another. A conclusion to draw from {{the result is that the}} plugin has been improved from Terefe’s implementation, although more work can be made with the plugin Date adjustment tools...|$|R

First, there is substantial variation in granularity in that many firms have either very concentrated or highly dispersed maturity structures. Second, our model's predictions are consistent with observed variation in granularity. Corporate debt maturities are more dispersed for larger and more mature firms, for firms with better investment opportunities, with higher leverage ratios, and {{with lower levels of}} current cash flows. We also show that during the recent financial crisis especially firms with valuable investment opportunities implemented more dispersed maturity structures. Finally, granularity plays an important role for bond issuances, because we document that newly issued corporate bond maturities complement pre-existing bond maturity profiles...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to advise {{managers}} {{on the status of}} Year 2000 readiness at the Laboratory and provide a summary of critical issues to be addressed {{in order to ensure that}} the Year 2000 <b>date</b> <b>rollover</b> will not disrupt Laboratory Operations. The Laboratory`s Year 2000 council members are in the first phase of Year 2000 plans: gathering data and assessing the status of their divisions or programs. This first snapshot of the Laboratory Year 2000 readiness assessment is expected to grow and change over time as more refined assessments, plans, and schedules are developed and as more information becomes available. Here are findings to date: (1) Embedded systems` status not known. (2) Preliminary cost estimates for Year 2000 repairs, testing, and implementation are estimated to be at least $ 5. 9 million, not including embedded systems. (3) The Laboratory is required to make unavoidable purchases of Year 2000 -compliant products. (4) The Year 2000 short-term issue forces some long-term transition plans to be set aside. (5) The Laboratory is at risk for the following consequences if they can`t demonstrate an active Year 2000 program: risk of system failures; potential funding freezes by the OMB and DOE; legal liabilities; and risk to the UC contract. (6) The deadline for this project is immutable. (7) DOE is continually increasing reporting requirements, expanding from only DOE mission-essential to all operations.

40|$|Architecture Organizations miss a {{tremendous}} opportunity for gain by regarding the Y 2 K experience solely as a costly necessity {{they would just}} as soon forget. Preparing information systems for the 2000 <b>date</b> <b>rollover</b> was generally regarded solely as a necessary and costly endeavor. In the popular media [2] and industry press [1], the focus was almost exclusively negative, and reports generally addressed the Y 2 K issue as an operating cost organizations had to bear. Few discussions addressed the long-term organizational advantages to be gained from this experience [8], or the opportunity Y 2 K preparation presented for an organizations. In this article, we address these shortcomings by detailing the gains achieved in the U. S. Combined Forces Command (CFC). Our experience suggests additional benefits can be gained from Y 2 K costs—which exceeded $ 3 trillion worldwide [2]—by using the experiences of Y 2 K testing to develop a method to improve an organization’s information technology systems. Our experience is applicable outside of a military setting. CFC’s need for continual operation 90 October 2000 /Vol. 43, No. 10 COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM is also shared by commercial corporations in the financial and public utility sectors, as well as mass transportation hubs, such as international airports and shipping centers.
