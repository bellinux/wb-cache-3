40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on the determination of basic chemical characteristics of selected <b>red</b> <b>currants</b> varieties from the Research and Breeding Institute of Pomology Holovousy Ltd. The theoretical part concentrates on general information about <b>red</b> <b>currant,</b> such as history of cultivation, origin and its expansion. There is also mention of the general characteristics of currant, currant building and significance of <b>red</b> <b>currant</b> cultivation. Chapter "Individual varieties" deals with the analysed varieties of <b>red</b> <b>currants,</b> especially its description and its biological properties, followed by an overview of the main substances contained in <b>red</b> <b>currants</b> and their brief description. Bachelor thesis also presents examples of the processing and the utilization of <b>red</b> <b>currant</b> in the food industry. The final chapter provides information about the individual determinations of the chemical characteristics of <b>red</b> <b>currants,</b> which include juice yield, soluble solids content, total dry matter content, pH, titratable acidity, formol number and reducing sugars. The experimental part describes the specific conditions and methods of individual determinations, followed by a summary of the results and their discussion. Variety Jesan showed the highest juice yield (63 ml per 100 g) and the highest pH value (3, 16). The highest soluble solids content (13, 94 %) and the highest formol number (22, 83 ml of 0, 1 M NaOH per 100 g) was determined in a variety Jonkheer van Tets. The highest dry matter value was detected for variety Rovada (14, 48 %). The titratable acids content was highest in variety NŠLS 11 / 6 (403, 88 mmol•kg- 1).

40|$|Over decades, {{growers in}} the Netherlands have {{problems}} with a disease that causes dying branches and stem cankers in <b>red</b> <b>currant.</b> For many years {{it was assumed that}} this disease was related to fungi such as Nectria cinnabarina, Phomopsis spp. and the insect Synanthedon tipuliformis. However, recently it was found by Applied Plant Research and the Plant Protection Service that the causal organism is the fungus Eutypa lata. The disease is considered of major economic importance, especially as <b>red</b> <b>currant</b> growing is rapidly expanding in the Netherlands. E. lata was identified with three detection methods (visual, plating and DNA). Symptoms of E. lata do not usually appear until currant plants are at least three to four years old. These cankers are always associated with old pruning wounds. Eventually, the entire branch is killed. High disease incidences and annual losses of 10 % to 30 % of the productive branches are reported. In some cases entire fields have to be replanted. E. lata is well {{known as one of the}} most destructive diseases of grapevines (Vitis vinifera). The importance of this disease in currant growing was not known. Research is focusing on the evaluation of control measures; e. g. chemical and biological control treatment of pruning wounds, and disease management such as sanitation practices. Also, the epidemiology of E. lata is studied. High densities of ascospores of E. lata were found in a spore trap placed in a <b>red</b> <b>currant</b> field in the Netherlands. In the subsequent field survey fruiting structures (stromata) and ascospores were found on dead infected <b>red</b> <b>currant</b> wood...|$|R

In this study influence of phenolic compounds addition (catechol, 4 -methyl catechol, (+) -catechin and gallic acid) on stability of <b>red</b> <b>currant</b> juice anthocyanins (copigment:pigment molar ratio 50 : 1 and 100 : 1) during 30 days of storage at 4 °C was investigated. Stability of anthocyanins was evaluated through determination of anthocyanins, total colour difference (ΔE*), kinetic parameters and anthocyanin retention. The initial anthocyanin content of <b>red</b> <b>currant</b> juice was 44. 34 mg/ 100 g. During storage degradation of anthocyanins occurred. After storage anthocyanin content of <b>red</b> <b>currant</b> juice was 38. 87 mg/ 100 mL. However, in samples with addition of phenolic compounds degradation was less pronounced due to formation of pigment-copigment complex (i. e. copigmentation). Anthocyanin content in samples with addition of phenolic compounds ranged from 39. 2 to 43. 83 mg/ 100 mL, depending on phenolic compound, its concentration and storage time. The lowest degradation was observed when gallic acid was added.

It was important to monitor total colour change (ΔE*) with CIELAB colour system since all parameters are taken into account.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of the laboratory investigation of the influence of high temperatures on water regime of <b>red</b> <b>currant</b> in Institute of Fruit Selection. It shows the dependence of water loss by leaves on the phenophase of plant development. High water loss by leaves occurs during the phase of ripening berries (July). Low water loss is noted during the active growth of shoots (June). Red currant genotypes: «Valentinovka», «Bayna» have a high percent of water loss in June and July. Genotypes «Shedraya», «Gollandskay krasnay», «Orlovchanka», «Dar Orla», «Selyanochka», «Osipovskay», «Belka» and «Jonker van Tets» have a low percent of loss water. The loss of water at the temperature shock is the important protective mechanism from over heat and death of plants. The results of the investigation of a degree of water restoration by <b>red</b> <b>currant</b> leaves in the periods of berry ripening and active growth of shoots are given. The most part of genotypes of <b>red</b> <b>currant</b> leaves have a high percent (> 50 %) of water restoration.

The total phenolics content ranged from 3. 2 (green gooseberries) to 13. 5 (black currants) mg/g fruit fresh weight. No correlation was found between total phenolics and antioxidant activity.

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} capacity (AOC) {{of black}} <b>currant,</b> blueberry, raspberry, <b>red</b> <b>currant,</b> and cranberry extracts was determined using the FRAP assay.

A complex spectrum of anthocyanins was the major contributor to the AOC of black currants and blueberries, whereas the lower AOC of <b>red</b> <b>currants</b> and cranberries was due mainly to a reduced anthocyanin content. Raspberries also had a lower anthocyanin content than black currants and blueberries, {{but there was only}} a slight decline in the AOC {{because of the presence of}} the ellagitannins sanguin H- 6 and lambertianin C, which were responsible for 58 % of the HPLC-AOC of the berries.
