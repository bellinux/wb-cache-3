25|$|Some colored ribbons (such as brown) {{were also}} available. The <b>ribbon</b> <b>cartridge</b> {{mechanism}} {{did not allow}} the use of two-color ribbons, such as black and red, that had been common on earlier typewriters.|$|E
25|$|The Correcting Selectric II used a new <b>ribbon</b> <b>{{cartridge}}</b> mechanism. The cartridge contained both {{supply and}} take-up spools, permitting both easy ribbon {{changes and the}} use of several types of ribbon on one machine. The ribbons were wider than had been used previously, giving more typed characters per inch of ribbon. Successive characters were staggered vertically on the ribbon, which incremented less than a full character position each time. Different types of ribbons had different-depth holes {{in the bottom of the}} cartridge, which set the mechanism to advance the ribbon by the amount appropriate for the type of ribbon.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973 the Correcting Selectric II was announced. It {{added an}} {{internal}} correction feature to the Selectric II, intended {{to eliminate the}} need for typists to use cover-up tape, [...] "white-out" [...] correction fluid, or typewriter erasers. The carriage on this machine held both the main typing <b>ribbon</b> <b>cartridge</b> and two small spools for a correction ribbon. A new ribbon type, the Correctable Film ribbon, was introduced at the same time. This produced typing quality equal to the carbon film ribbon, but with a pigment designed to be easily removable from paper.|$|E
50|$|MicroDry is a {{computer}} printing system developed by the ALPS corporation of Japan. It is a wax/resin-transfer system using individual colored thermal <b>ribbon</b> <b>cartridges,</b> and can print in process color using cyan, magenta, yellow, and black cartridges, as well as such spot-color cartridges as white, metallic silver, and metallic gold, {{on a wide variety}} of paper and transparency stock. Certain MicroDry printers can also operate in dye sublimation mode, using special cartridges and paper. ALPS licensed the technology to Citizen (Printiva series) and to Okidata (Oki DP series). Alps also produced the actual printer hardware and ink <b>ribbon</b> <b>cartridges</b> for those companies.|$|R
5000|$|Single-strike ribbons {{created a}} risk of espionage and loss of privacy, because the used ribbon reel could be unwound to reveal {{everything}} that had been printed. Secure disposal was required by shredding, melting, or burning of used <b>ribbon</b> <b>cartridges</b> to prevent recovery of information from garbage bins.|$|R
2500|$|Some of IBM's {{advances}} {{were later}} adopted in less expensive machines from competitors. [...] For example, Smith-Corona electric typewriters introduced in 1973 switched to interchangeable Coronamatic (SCM-patented) <b>ribbon</b> <b>cartridges,</b> including fabric, film, erasing, and two-color versions. At {{about the same}} time, the advent of photocopying meant that carbon copies and erasers were less and less necessary; only the original need be typed, and photocopies made from it.|$|R
2500|$|The {{thumb wheel}} on the <b>ribbon</b> <b>cartridge</b> and the {{correction}} tape spools were color-coded {{so they could}} be easily identified and matched with the appropriate correction tapes: Yellow for the correctable film ribbon and Lift-Off tape; gray, pink, and blue for cloth, carbon film, and Tech-3, respectively. Later another type of correctable film ribbon and lift-off tape appeared, both color-coded orange. The yellow meant the ribbon was a higher quality and would produce a better quality type image. [...] Orange was a lower cost ribbon for everyday typing. The yellow and orange coded lift-off tapes would work with either ribbon type.|$|E

50|$|In 1973, SCM {{introduced}} a <b>cartridge</b> <b>ribbon</b> which eliminated the long-standing problem of getting ink-stained fingers from hand-threading a replacement spool of inked ribbon.|$|R
40|$|Water-cooled optical probe {{measures}} {{temperature of}} nearby radiating object. Intended primarily {{for use in}} silicon-growing furnace for measuring and controlling temperatures of silicon <b>ribbon,</b> meniscus, <b>cartridge</b> surfaces, heaters, or other parts. Cooling water and flushing gas cool fiber-optic probe and keep it clean. Fiber passes thermal radiation from observed surface to measuring instrument...|$|R
50|$|In 1984 Thunderware {{introduced}} the ThunderScan, an optical scanner that {{was installed in}} place of the ImageWriter <b>ribbon</b> <b>cartridge.</b> With support for the Apple II and the Mac, the ThunderScan provided low cost grayscale scanning with moderate resolution and speed.|$|E
50|$|A thermal {{transfer}} printer contains a <b>ribbon</b> <b>cartridge</b> that uses a wax ink. When the heating elements in the print head heat up, they melt the wax and transfer it to the paper, thus {{the need for the}} paper to be really smooth. This also means that the ribbon cannot be reused after the head runs over it, since the wax transfers off the ribbon to the paper.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the phony}} {{products}} “introduced” by Kitchen Table International actually came to pass. Several {{years after the}} company demonstrated its Reverse LPRINT command, which allowed a dot-matrix printer {{to function as a}} scanner (the demo was actually a videotape run backwards, showing sheets of text feeding into a printer and coming out blank after they had been [...] "scanned"), Thunderware introduced the Thunderscan scanner, which replaced the <b>ribbon</b> <b>cartridge</b> of an Apple ImageWriter with a scanning module.|$|E
50|$|PFSweb, Inc. {{was founded}} in 1994 as Priority Fulfillment Services, Inc. (PFS) by Texas-based Daisytek International Corporation, a leading {{wholesale}} distributor of computer and office automation supplies such as printer <b>ribbons,</b> toner <b>cartridges,</b> and computer disks. The new unit was initially created to perform order-processing, fulfillment, and telemarketing services for other companies, due to a growing demand for outsourcing in this area. Soon after its formation under Daisytek, PFSweb was chosen to perform telemarketing and distribution services for IBM product lines throughout North America.|$|R
5000|$|Gray {{was born}} in San Francisco, California, the second child of a mother who was a teacher and a father in the U.S. Army; {{the family moved to}} Rome where Gray spent most of {{the first three years of}} his life, {{learning}} to speak Italian before English. [...] The family then moved to Virginia, spending about four years there, until Gray's parents divorced, after which he returned to San Francisco with his mother. [...] His father, an amateur inventor, patented a design for a <b>ribbon</b> <b>cartridge</b> for typewriters that earned him a substantial royalty stream.|$|E

50|$|The printer had an {{expansion}} socket under {{the front cover}} which could accommodate either Apple's AppleTalk network card or 32K memory buffer card, but not {{both at the same}} time. Sequential Systems produced a 2-in-1 solution card that combined both features into one card, as well as larger memory buffer cards up to 1 MB. With an optional AppleTalk networking card installed, it was a low-cost alternative to the vastly more expensive LaserWriter. Another third-party innovation was an add-on peripheral called the ThunderScan, which allowed the printer to work as a low-cost optical scanner (the scanner mechanism temporarily replaced the ink <b>ribbon</b> <b>cartridge).</b>|$|E

50|$|Single-strike and Multi-strike ribbons were {{an attempt}} to address issues in the ribbon's ink quality. Standard printer ribbons used the same {{principles}} as typewriter ribbons. The printer would be at its darkest with a newly installed <b>ribbon</b> <b>cartridge,</b> but would gradually grow fainter with each successive printout. The variation in darkness over the ribbon cartridge's lifetime prompted the introduction of alternative ribbon formulations. Single-strike ribbons used a carbon-like substance in typewriter ribbons transfer. As the ribbon was only usable for a single loop (rated in terms of 'character count'), the blackness was of consistent, outstanding darkness. Multi-strike nylon ribbons gave an increase in ribbon life, {{at the expense of}} quality.|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} code which {{can account for}} plastic deformation effects on stress generated in silicon sheet grown at high speeds is fully operative. Stress and strain rate distributions are presented for two different sheet temperature profiles. The calculations show that residual stress levels {{are very sensitive to}} details of the cooling profile in a sheet with creep. Experimental work has been started in several areas to improve understanding of ribbon temperature profiles and stress distributions associated with a 10 cm wide <b>ribbon</b> <b>cartridge</b> system...|$|E
