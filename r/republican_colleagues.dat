5|$|As House Speaker, Gingrich oversaw passage by the House {{of welfare}} reform and {{a capital gains tax}} cut in 1997. The poor showing by Republicans in the 1998 Congressional elections, a {{reprimand}} from the House for Gingrich's ethics violation, and pressure from <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues,</b> resulted in Gingrich's resignation from the speakership on November 6, 1998. He resigned altogether from the House on January 3, 1999.|$|E
5|$|When the 38th Congress {{convened in}} December 1863, the Civil War was {{approaching}} its end. Randall was a War Democrat, sometimes siding with his <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues</b> to support measures {{in pursuit of}} victory over the Confederates. When a bill was proposed to allow President Abraham Lincoln to promote Ulysses S. Grant to lieutenant general, Randall voted in favor, unlike most in his party. He voted {{with the majority of}} Democrats, however, to oppose allowing black men to serve in the Union Army.|$|E
25|$|Hutchison broke {{ranks with}} her <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues</b> and opposed {{an attempt to}} stall the Democrats' health-care bill in the Senate.|$|E
50|$|In Steven Spielberg's 2012 Lincoln film, both English and Augustus Brandegee, his {{abolitionist}} <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague</b> from Connecticut, {{are given}} two fictional names and are both shown, erroneously, to have {{voted against the}} amendment.|$|R
50|$|Pearson is {{chairman}} of the House Retirement Committee.

50|$|In March 2015, Bennett hugged {{to console}} a <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague,</b> DeAnn Vaught of Horatio in Sevier County, when Vaught spoke {{in support of}} {{legislation}} dealing with the reporting of cases of child maltreatment and referred to her own experiences regarding the issue.|$|R
25|$|When Hugh Scott retired, Baker {{was elected}} senate {{minority}} leader in 1977 by his <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues,</b> defeating Robert Griffin, 19-18. Baker served two terms as Senate Minority Leader (1977–81) and two terms as Senate Majority Leader (1981–85).|$|E
25|$|On January 7, 2006, {{after weeks}} of growing {{pressure}} from <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues,</b> and particularly from Reps. Charlie Bass and Jeff Flake, who wanted to avoid being associated with DeLay's legal issues in an election year, DeLay announced he would not seek to regain his position as Majority Leader.|$|E
25|$|First {{elected to}} office in 1977, Bunning served {{two years on}} the city council of Fort Thomas, Kentucky before running for and winning {{a seat in the}} Kentucky Senate as a Republican. He was elected {{minority}} leader by his <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues,</b> a rare feat for a freshman legislator.|$|E
50|$|Bumpers opposed {{constitutional}} amendments throughout his Senate tenure and {{was critical of}} his <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague,</b> Jesse Helms of North Carolina for attempting that route to enact conservative policy proposals. However, Bumpers said that he worked well with Republican leaders Howard Baker and Bob Dole.|$|R
50|$|The {{selection}} of Perry's successor as lieutenant governor ultimately fell upon Bill Ratliff of Mt. Pleasant, who defeated <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague</b> David Sibley of Waco, 16-15. Considered a moderate Republican, Ratcliff {{did not seek}} election to the post in 2002, then won by and held since by David Dewhurst.|$|R
2500|$|Enzi's <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague,</b> John Barrasso of Casper, {{who succeeded}} Thomas, agrees: [...] "I know Mr. Honaker and respect {{him as an}} individual. I admire his legal {{abilities}} and his passion for the law. There is no question {{he is ready to}} fill the seat for which he has been nominated." ...|$|R
25|$|In February 2004, Castle {{sponsored}} H.R. 3831 to reauthorize {{the assault}} weapons ban of 1994. The bill was co-sponsored by 11 <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues</b> and 129 Democrats. In June 2008, Rep. Mark Kirk, R-IL, introduced H.R. 6257 to reinstate the ban, and Castle was one of the bill's four Republican co-sponsors. Both bills died in committee.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 2006, Ney {{resigned}} {{as chairman of}} the House Administration Committee. He maintained that he had done nothing wrong, but had been under increasing pressure to stand down since his ties to Abramoff were an increasing embarrassment in light of Republican plans for reforms of lobbying and campaign finance rules. The House Administration Committee has jurisdiction over elections and lobbyists. House Speaker Dennis Hastert reportedly emailed a Roll Call article regarding Ney's precarious hold on the gavel to several Capitol beat reporters. Ney's resignation was officially temporary. However, even some of his <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues</b> expected him to be indicted. Under Republican caucus rules, he would have permanently lost his chairmanship if indicted.|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, Booker co-sponsored {{and voted}} for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. In December 2013, {{he was one of}} the {{original}} cosponsors of Bob Menéndez's Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013, which would toughen sanctions against Iran.

50|$|In 2017, Stickland {{offered an}} {{unsuccessful}} amendment to prohibit state {{aid to the}} abatement of feral hogs. In retaliation for Stickland's amendment, his <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague,</b> Drew Springer, Jr., of Muenster, backed by Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio, obtained passage of another amendment to defund $900,000 from the Texas Department of Transportation earmarked for Stickland's hometown of Bedford.|$|R
50|$|In mid-March 2017, O'Rourke {{joined his}} <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague</b> Will Hurd of Texas's 23rd congressional {{district}} in driving from Texas to Washington, D.C. in {{a rental car}} after an East Coast storm canceled many air flights.

5000|$|In late February 2010, Merkley again made {{headlines}} when he unsuccessfully {{tried to persuade}} <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague</b> Jim Bunning of Kentucky to drop his objection to passing a 30-day extension of unemployment benefits for jobless Americans. Bunning replied, [...] "Tough shit." [...] A spokesman for Merkley said that the Oregon senator did not hear Bunning's remark at the time.|$|R
500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1986 elections, it {{was unclear}} whether Mathias would seek a fourth term. His support of President Reagan was lukewarm, which had further {{isolated}} him ideologically from his <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues.</b> One delegate at the Maryland state party convention had even called Mathias [...] "liberal swine" [...] for his record. Additionally, his frequent difficulties in securing a committee chairmanship along with his low attendance rate were raising questions regarding his ability. However, Mathias was showing signs of seeking re-election in 1985, and dismissed any claims of ineffectiveness. Mathias claimed [...] "within a matter of minutes, I can talk to any member of the Cabinet; and I could go see them within 24 hours.... It was no accident that the Chesapeake Bay was mentioned in the President's State of the Union address. That took a lot of hard work".|$|E
500|$|Mathias' {{disagreements}} {{with the administration}} became well-known, causing columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak to name him the [...] "new supervillain... in President Nixon's doghouse". Evans and Novak also commented that [...] "not since [...] was defeated with White House connivance has any Republican so outraged Mr. Nixon and his senior staff as Mathias. The senator's liberalism and tendency to bolt party lines have bred animosity in the inner sanctum". Due to their differing ideologies, there was speculation that Mathias {{was going to be}} [...] "purged" [...] from the party by Nixon in a similar manner as Goodell in 1971, but these threats disappeared after the Watergate scandal escalated. By the numbers, Mathias sided with the Nixon administration 47% of the time, and voted with the majority of his <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues</b> in the Senate 31% of the time, during his first term.|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{was easily}} re-elected to his District 7 seat in 1968 and 1970. [...] The Republicans enjoyed a {{majority}} in the House during both sessions. [...] Martin’s <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues</b> selected him to serve as Speaker Pro Tempore during the 1971 legislative session.|$|E
25|$|Black November has had {{significant}} impact; Amata and associate producer Lorenzo Omo-Aligbe {{were invited to}} the White House regarding the film; Congressman Bobby Rush and his <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague</b> Jeff Fortenberry were so affected by the film that they sponsored a joint resolution aimed at pressurizing the Nigerian government and Western oil companies to clean up spills in the Niger Delta.|$|R
50|$|District 86 {{includes}} rural Dallam, Hartley, Oldham, and Deaf Smith counties. Smithee's {{district office}} is in Amarillo. He represents {{that part of}} Amarillo, some 40 percent of the population, located {{to the south of}} the central city within Randall County. The remainder of Amarillo, the seat of Potter County, is represented by Smithee's <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague,</b> Four Price, a lawyer from Amarillo.|$|R
5000|$|Former state Representative Joseph F. Toomy, a <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague</b> of Ullo's, {{also from}} Jefferson Parish {{who was also}} term-limited in 2008, {{described}} Ullo as [...] "a very conscientious legislator" [...] {{who worked for the}} interests of Marrero in particular and the West Bank in general. Toomy cited Ullo's work for the completion of the elevated West Bank Expressway as perhaps his major accomplishments.|$|R
2500|$|In a March 20, 2015 CNN interview, Wilkerson said, [...] "I {{would say}} very, very candidly that Iran is {{probably}} the most democratic country in the Persian gulf region right now. My <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues</b> will boil their eyes at that, but it is the most democratic country. It's a theocracy, no question about it. But it is possessed of the democratic tendencies that far outweigh those of, say, Bahrain or Saudi Arabia or even Egypt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martin was re-elected to his District 24 seat {{two more}} times, in 1974 and 1976. [...] This {{allowed him to}} serve in the legislature’s regular {{sessions}} in 1975 and 1977 plus two special sessions, one in December 1975 and the other in September 1978. [...] During this period, Martin’s <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues</b> in the state House of Representatives elected him as their leader. [...] Because Democrats held the majority of seats in House, he served as the House minority leader for four years.|$|E
2500|$|I would {{certainly}} {{never do anything}} to diminish {{the horror of the}} Nazi Holocaust as I revere and respect the history of my people. [...] I sponsored legislation which created one of the first state Holocaust Commissions in America and actively served as a Commission member for over 20 years. [...] I regret that anyone in the Jewish Community, my <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues</b> or anyone else was offended by the portrayal of my comments. [...] My comments were not directed toward any group or people but at the false message and, specifically, the method by which it has been delivered.|$|E
5000|$|In an across-the-aisle gesture {{which was}} rare in Congress at the time, Richmond in 2014 defended his <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague</b> Vance McAllister, {{who had become}} embroiled in an alleged {{adultery}} scandal. Richmond associated the controversy with [...] "gotcha moments" [...] in which the [...] "two parties {{in this country have}} gone overboard...and taken joy in the pain of their supposed opponents".|$|R
50|$|In the Senate, Morton was {{considered}} a moderate and voted, along with his <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague</b> John Sherman Cooper and most other Republicans, for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A compromise that Morton proposed to guarantee jury trials in all criminal contempt cases except for voting rights proved, {{with the assistance of}} Senators Everett Dirksen and Bourke Hickenlooper, crucial in passing that Civil Rights Act.|$|R
2500|$|From {{the start}} of his Senate term, Warner {{attempted}} to replicate in Washington, D.C. the bipartisan partnerships that he used effectively during his tenure as Virginia governor. In 2010, Warner worked with a <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague</b> on the Banking Committee, Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), to write a key portion of the Dodd-Frank Act that seeks to end taxpayer bailouts of failing Wall Street financial firms by requiring [...] "advance funeral plans" [...] for large financial firms.|$|R
2500|$|On July 20, 2010, Sessions {{and five}} <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues</b> voted against Kagan's nomination. Despite this, the Judiciary Committee {{approved}} the nomination by a 13–6 vote. Sessions also voted against Kagan {{in the full}} Senate vote, joining 36 other senators (including one Democrat) in opposition. 63 senators voted to confirm Kagan. Following the vote, Sessions remarked on future nominations and elections, saying that Americans would [...] "not forgive the Senate if we further expose our Constitution to revision and rewrite by judicial fiat to advance what President Obama says is a broader vision of what America should be".|$|E
2500|$|However, on {{the topic}} of Iraq, which the House {{discussed}} in detail in winter and early spring of 2007, Pryce sided firmly with her <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues,</b> supporting Ohio Republican congressman John Boehner's H.R. 1062, [...] "holding the Administration and the Iraqi government accountable for progress in the prosecution of the war in Iraq." [...] The bill [...] "requires the President to submit a status report to Congress every 30 days detailing the success of the recent 21,500 troop increase {{and the extent to which}} the Iraqi government is cooperating with the US stability efforts. It also creates a bipartisan panel to study proposals from relevant committees, the executive branch, and private sector entities concerning the development of US policy and strategy in Iraq." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sales {{has been}} {{described}} as an [...] "outspoken conservative" [...] and an [...] "ultraconservative." [...] At the time Sales was selected by his <b>Republican</b> <b>colleagues</b> in 2006 to serve as speaker of the House, the Billings Gazette described him as [...] "easily one of the body's most conservative members." [...] He is a supporter of the Tea Party movement, favors budget cuts and tax cuts, supports [...] "right-to-work" [...] legislation, and expanded gun rights. Sales praised Sarah Palin in 2009, saying: [...] "I think she {{should be part of the}} discourse and part of the process." [...] Sales criticized the Affordable Care Act and in the Montana Legislature voted against accepting the act's Medicaid expansion, stating, [...] "There is no constitutional guarantee to healthcare." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1975, Treen {{was joined}} by his first Louisiana <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague</b> in the U.S. House when Henson Moore won Louisiana's 6th congressional {{district}} seat based in and about Baton Rouge and the Florida Parishes. Moore won the seat formerly held by the Democrat John Rarick. In 1976, Treen polled 73.3 percent in a race against a nominal Democratic opponent, {{in a year when}} Jimmy Carter, Democrat from Georgia, carried Louisiana over Gerald R. Ford (R).|$|R

5000|$|In June 2015, Democratic Representative John Conyers and his <b>Republican</b> <b>colleague</b> Ted Yoho offered {{bipartisan}} {{amendments to}} block the U.S. military training of Ukraine's Azov Battalion — called a “neo-Nazi paramilitary militia” by Conyers and Yoho. Andriy Biletsky, {{the head of the}} ultra-nationalist and neo-Nazi political groups Social-National Assembly and Patriots of Ukraine, has been commander of the Azov Battalion. Azov Battalion of the Ukrainian National Guard is fighting pro-Russian separatists in the War in Donbass. Some members of the battalion are openly white supremacists.|$|R
