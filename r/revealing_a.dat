She may not necessarily have been local, as lead coffins were used to transport corpses over long distances.|$|E

5|$|The rings were {{thoroughly}} investigated {{during the}} Voyager 2 spacecraft's flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Two new faint rings—λ and 1986U2R—were discovered {{bringing the total}} number then known to eleven. Rings were studied by analysing results of radio, ultraviolet and optical occultations. Voyager 2 observed the rings in different geometries relative to the sun, producing images with back-scattered, forward-scattered and side-scattered light. Analysis of these images allowed derivation of the complete phase function, geometrical and Bond albedo of ring particles. Two rings—ε and η—were resolved in the images <b>revealing</b> <b>a</b> complicated fine structure. Analysis of Voyager's images also led to discovery of eleven inner moons of Uranus, including the two shepherd moons of the ε ring—Cordelia and Ophelia.|$|E

During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah.
