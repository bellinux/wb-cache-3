40|$|Killing {{unproductive}} {{animals and}} managing their corpses makes up an increasing part {{of work in}} industrial pig production. Until now these tasks were carried out by slaughterhouses. But the situation is changing. In industrial systems scientists and technicians are incorporating death as part of work. They produce concepts and tools so that workers can do their killing job “cleanly”. New procedures such as euthanasia, composting and incineration have been introduced to this end. A review of scientific and technical papers {{and analysis of the}} concepts used enabled us to show that these procedures are based on the euphemization of violence and occultation of animal death. By describing animal pain as a biological problem which can be measured independently of other considerations, slaughter of unproductive animal may be constructed as “euthanasia”. Worker suffering is thus mitigated since “euthanasia” is in fine considered merciful to animals. Corpse management is based on corpse construction as <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> in which <b>animal</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> is considered similar to plant raw material: both refer to nature, i. e. to inevitable death and decomposition.

Experimental data analysis demonstrates that in case of the extract that contains protein-peptidic complexes in different molecular weights range, the Kingsley-Weichselbaum method shows the highest quality of protein concentration determination; while studying highmolecular weight fraction (more than 30 kDa), it is possible to obtain more information by combining the spectrophotometric method and the Kingsley-Weichselbaum method. Low-molecular weight fractions (less than 30 kD) should be investigated by complex methods including the spectrophotometric method, Lowry and Bradford methods.

LAB and bifidobacteria are also natural inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of human and animals where they exert an array of protective and beneficial effects; a property {{that has led to}} the use of members of these two microbial types as probiotics. Antibiotics have greatly contributed over the last 65 years to human life expectancy and quality of life in the fight against infectious diseases. However, their efficacy is being severely threatened by the appearance and worldwide spread of antibiotic resistance. At present, there is great concern that commensal and beneficial bacterial populations, such as the food-borne and GIT-associated bacteria, become a reservoir for resistances, from which they could ultimately be transferred to human pathogens and opportunistic bacteria. Transferable resistances carried by starters and probiotics could be spread either during food manufacture or during passage through the GIT. Consequently, discriminating between resistant and susceptible strains, and distinguishing between intrinsic, non-transferable and acquired, transferable resistances is vital in order of not to disseminate antibiotic resistances via the food chain. Genes conferring resistance to several antibiotics have already been identified and characterized in strains of LAB and bifidobacteria. In particular, tet(W) and erm(B), encoding tetracycline and erythromycin resistance, respectively, seem to be widely spread among species of these bacterial groups. Some of these genes have proved to be transferable in laboratory conditions, but also in food and in animal GIT systems. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFractionation {{of plant}} and <b>animal</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> by pH-shift {{processing}} has been widely applied to purify proteins. The principle is to solubilize proteins at high or low pH, removing debris and precipitating the proteins near their isoelectric point. We here describe the pH-shift process on commercially available Nannochloropsis oculata. The partitioning of major nutrients into the various fractions of the process was studied. Proteins were found to exhibit maximal solubility between pH 7 and 10, with a minimal solubility below pH 4. Two process versions were investigated in this study, with solubilization at either pH 7 (native pH) or 10; both versions were precipitated at pH 3. Up to 85 % of both the protein and total fatty acids were recovered in the final product, compared to the initial algal slurry. Protein, total fatty acids and carbohydrates were concentrated in the final product, while the ash content was lower compared to the starting material. From a processing point of view, solubilization of Nannochloropsis at native pH {{was found to be}} preferable, since less chemicals were consumed compared to high-pH solubilization. Owing to its content of protein and (total) fatty acids (23 and 12 % of dry weight, respectively), the latter enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), the product of the pH-shift process has potential as a functional food ingredient...|$|R

In this respect organoleptic analyzes were performed on appearance (exterior and section), color, smell, texture and taste of the finished product (after roasting), the results highlighting that, in terms of organoleptic, sample 1 obtained the highest score (on a scale of 1 -poor to 5 -very good quality) (average 21. 83), followed by sample 3 (average 19. 22), the very small difference {{in the case of}} sample 2 (average 19. 19) and finally, sample 4 (average 18. 75). It was noted that sample 1 obtained the highest score (average) of all analyzed organoleptic indicators: appearance (4. 33), color (4. 39), smell (4. 67), texture (4. 33) and taste (4. 11) being favorite by all volunteer subjects who participated at the analysis. The same thing was found in sensory analysis of mici paste in fresh/chilled condition: 65 % of subjects preferred variant 1 followed by variant 3 (19. 2 %), variant 2 (11. 5 %) and finally, variant 4 (3. 8 %). In terms of economic the highest efficiency was found in 2 (specific consumption 0. 73) and 4 (specific consumption 0. 77) variants compared to 1 (specific consumption 0. 80) and 3 (specific consumption 0. 82) variants, which translates into a reduction in the cost of products manufactured in the variants 2 and 4 (with protein supplements and additive mix) by about 25 - 20 % (with importance for the manufacturer). Also, thermal processing (roasting) revealed the highest weight loss (drying) in 3 (18. 75 %) and 1 (12. 50 %) variants compared to 4 (12. 33 %) and 2 (10 %) variants in which case the vegetable protein supplements contributed to increased water retention capacity, and the processing way of the raw materials - their mechanical grinding (in this case) was another important factor that influenced the level of these technological losses that {{have a negative impact on}} the consumer.

Postrainy-sorghum is a highly valued foodgrain, and thus too expensive to be used as industrial <b>raw</b> <b>material.</b> <b>Animal</b> Feed Sector While discussing sorghum utilization for animal feed in India, one has to distinguish between poultry and dairy production. Although the latter has a solid foundation in the co-operative sector, the poultry industry appears to be more dynamic. According to poultry producers and feed millers, very little sorghum was used in poultry feed in 1998 / 99 due to the availability of maize and its price advantage. Nevertheless, it was acknowledged that in the past, when maize was expensive, sorghum had been used at an inclusion rate of up to 10 % in the case of broilers and up to 15 % in the case of layers. Estimates of the industrial demand for sorghum are summarized in Table 1. The demand for sorghum in poultry feed largely depends on the price of maize, which is the energy source preferred by poultry producers. According to industry sources, to make sorghum competitive, its price should be 20 - 30 % lower than that of maize. ...|$|R
