5|$|The Algo Centre Mall (legally Eastwood Mall since 2005 {{but almost}} never {{referred}} to as such) was a mall and hotel located {{in the middle of}} Elliot Lake, Ontario's commercial district on Highway 108. It was the largest commercial complex in the area. When the community was hit by uranium mine closures in the 1990s, the complex gradually refocused, hosting multiple services, such as a library, constituency offices, and public health offices. In recent years, many businesses located in the mall either closed or moved to outside locations. Still, the mall was a community hub, with most of the area's clothing stores and its largest grocery store, employing upwards of 250 local residents. It accounted for 10% of community's <b>retail</b> <b>space</b> and 6% of the total wages.|$|E

5|$|The Galeries Lafayette {{store was}} then {{replaced}} with a Niketown location. By this time, most of the high-end retailers had moved out of Trump Tower, having been replaced with more upper-middle-class outlets such as Coach and Dooney & Bourke. The Niketown store still remained in the tower as of the 2016 election with a lease in that location until 2022. Nike also leased some space at 6 East 57th Street next to the tower, but in November 2016, it signed a $700 million contract for a new <b>retail</b> <b>space</b> a few blocks south, having intended {{to move out of}} 6 East 57th since 2013. During and after the election, there were petitions to relocate the Niketown store, created by advocacy organizations who opposed Trump's election.|$|E
5|$|Triumph {{products}} are distributed both via trade partners and department stores, {{as well as}} in their own shops. By the end of 2011, the company had built a network of 2,000 stores in 120 countries, of which 800 are its own stores, 450 are franchises and 850 are run with other partners. The company {{is one of the largest}} lingerie retailers in Germany based on the number of branches.

These were developed using a fulfillment service provider that is part of Arvato.|$|E
5|$|While Union Station {{was busy}} from its opening and through World War II, {{passenger}} rail service began to dwindle {{after the war}} when air and highway travel became more popular. By the 1960s, the New York Central drastically cut service, while the Pennsylvania abandoned service to Erie altogether. Both railroads were merged in 1968 to form Penn Central, and passenger rail was transferred from Penn Central to Amtrak in 1971. At one point, from 1972 to 1975, even Amtrak service in Erie was suspended. With reduced demand for train travel, Union Station was neglected and allowed to decay until Logistics Plus bought it in 2003. Since then it has been restored, with portions re-purposed as commercial and <b>retail</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{construction}} {{began on}} a 60-home upscale development called Arlington Heights, and {{a grant from}} the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development allowed for the demolition of Westlake Terrace, a sprawling and dilapidated public housing project. Today, the site features a blend of senior housing, rental townhouses and for-sale single-family homes. Low real-estate prices and the efforts of the Youngstown Central Area Improvement Corporation (CIC) have contributed to the purchase of several long-abandoned downtown buildings (many by out-of-town investors) and their restoration and conversion into specialty shops, restaurants, and eventually condominiums. Further, a nonprofit organization called Wick Neighbors is planning a $250 million New Urbanist revitalization of Smoky Hollow, a former ethnic neighborhood that borders the downtown and university campus. The neighborhood will eventually comprise about 400 residential units, university student housing, <b>retail</b> <b>space,</b> and a central park. Construction for the project began in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 North Kesteven District Council {{produced}} a 25-year strategy to regenerate the town because its rapid growth since the 1990s had outgrown improvements to its infrastructure. It plans future residential developments and outlines ways {{of improving the}} town centre. It suggests developing more parking around the centre and reverting parts the one-way system, developing southern Southgate and turning Money's Yard into an attraction to link with the National Centre for Craft and Design. North Kesteven District Council granted planning permission for a £56m project to redevelop the derelict Bass Maltings site by converting it into residential and <b>retail</b> <b>space</b> and creating about 500 permanent jobs. The development including a supermarket was delayed when the town council opposed a link road through part of the recreation ground. Tesco, who had pledged {{to invest in a}} £20million store in the development withdrew in January 2015 following financial set-backs.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, {{contractors}} halted construction {{because of}} fears {{that they will}} not be paid. This caused Morningstar to reconsider their lease commitment. As a result, the value of the project declined, which made the resale of the project rights difficult. Mills was close to a deal with German investment firm, Deutsche Immobilien Fonds A.G. prior to the difficulties. DIFA had outbid Chicago developer Golub & Co., which then became the frontrunner. Golub, an international real estate investment company headquartered in Chicago, has closed on the office space portion of the project. Mills eventually sold the <b>retail</b> <b>space</b> rights to Chicago developer Joseph Freed & Associates, who had previously purchased the nearby Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building (located at 1 South State Street) that closed in early 2007.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} was finished in January 2005 with city officials and employees {{moving into the}} buildings {{by the end of}} March. A public grand opening was held on July 16, 2005, to officially open the center. Total cost of the public portion of the project was $34 million, with construction totaling $23.5 million. Prior to completion the city leased space in several downtown buildings, including the county's Public Services Building where Hillsboro also held city council meetings. Later in 2005 a coffee shop was added as a tenant in part of the <b>retail</b> <b>space,</b> and in 2007 the restaurant space in the {{building was}} leased to NW Hayden Enterprises for a restaurant scheduled to open in 2008. In April 2009, the plaza was renamed as the Tom Hughes Civic Center Plaza in honor of former mayor Tom Hughes who was mayor when the building was constructed.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the building were revamped to accommodate an open layout suitable for a department store. Non-structural interior walls were torn down. A new atrium was created by constructing a wall on the second storey, and {{could be used as}} an exhibition hall. A four-storey high waterfall was built {{at the back of the}} building, which has a new three-storey extension. A stained glass skylight was used as an interface to join the old and new parts of the building. New escalators and lifts were added to serve all six floors of the building. As a result, total floor space was increased from 3,700 to 4,600 square metres (39,800 to 49,500 square feet), with 4,650 square metres (50,000 square feet) of <b>retail</b> <b>space</b> created for use by the store.|$|E
