5000|$|In {{publishing}} and {{certain types of}} academic writing, a running header or <b>running</b> <b>headline</b> is a header that appears on each page. [...] Typical running heads in a book might consist of the book title on the left-hand (verso) page, and the chapter title on the right-hand (recto) page, or chapter title on the verso and subsection title on the recto. In academic writing, the running head usually contains a page number and the author's last name or an abbreviated version of the title.|$|E
50|$|The Pilgrim's Regress {{initially}} received {{mixed reviews}} {{and did not}} sell well. Subsequently, it was taken on by several different Publishers. By the third edition, however, Lewis had recognised the difficulties which some of his readers were having and wrote a critical and explanatory preface to clarify {{some of the issues}} that resulted from unintentional obscurity and changes in the philosophical thought of the early twentieth century. This edition also introduced a <b>running</b> <b>headline</b> format as a concession to the book's difficulty—but with reluctance, as Lewis expressed concern that it could lead to a misunderstanding of the nature of allegory, which exists to reveal rather than to hide.|$|E
40|$|<b>Running</b> <b>headline</b> – Halcroft et al. Thermal {{environment}} of A. australis nests The greatest diversity of stingless bee species {{is found in}} warm tropical regions, where brood thermoregulation is unnecessary for survival. Although Austroplebeia australis (Friese) naturally occurs in northern regions of Australia, some populations experience extreme temperature ranges, including sub-zero temperatures. In this study, the temperature was monitored in A. australis colonies ’ brood chamber (n = 6) and the hive cavity (n = 3), over a 12 month period. The A. australis colonies demonstrated some degree of thermoconformity, i. e. brood temperature although higher correlated with cavity temperature, {{and were able to}} warm the brood chamber throughout the year. Brood production continued throughout the cold season and developing offspring survived and emerged, even after exposure to very low (- 0. 4 °C) and high (37. 6 °C) temperatures. Austroplebeia australis, thus, demonstrated a remarkable ability to survive temperature extremes, which has not been seen in other stingless bee species. Key words: cluster-type brood, thermoregulate, passive warming, metabolic hea...|$|E

40|$|Confusion in Questions on Czech Literary and Readers Community on turn of 15 th and 16 th Centuries. – The article descibes the porces of {{establishing}} of Czech readers community in Bohemia after {{the introduction of}} book-print, i. e. in the Jagellonian period. As {{we do not have}} any relevant written sources, our reconstruction is based on study of literary, typographical and editorial activities. We suppose, that the editorial model of Czech-language literature, accesible only to the less prosperous craftsmen without knowledge of Latin, grew up the readers community very slowly due to its incompleteness. Another holdout of the constitutional proces was in the typography itself, whose late-gothic simplicity definitely slowed down the entry of so called silent reading. Composing visualisation means and methods (division of text in paragraphs, <b>running</b> <b>headlines,</b> pagination, marginalia, registers) were usually used abroad since the end of 15 th century, were in Czech print used slowly even {{during the first half of}} 16 th century. The crucial problem of Czech book-print and readership of this period is insufficient type variety, based on using only one or two sets of printing types. Due to this penury there was not possible to use the contrast between the printing characters (for example Schwabacher type) and title types (for example black letter type or rotunda) in compository proces. The editorial proces was also simplified to minimum and the entry of dedications or instructing prefaces was slower than abroad. All these indirect proofs show, that the establishment of readers community within our bourgeoisie society had to be slower than was admitted. The faster evolution is evident since 1520 s.

40|$|Ethical {{investments}} are a now a considerable {{sector in the}} investment market, with the Financial Times <b>running</b> the <b>headline</b> “Green and ethical investment comes of age” (Shepherd, [1]). Claudia Quiroz (lead fund manager for Cheviot Climate Assets Fund) predicts a strong future for ethical investment, with sustainable investment becoming a growing theme (Hoskin [2]). Much previous research in the “ ethical investment ” field divides investments into two categories: acceptable or unacceptable. This paper builds {{on the work of}} Barracchini and Addessi [3], in viewing how “ ethical ” an investment is to be a different dimension — each investment is seen as being on a continuum, from “ least ethical ” to “ most ethical ”. This paper takes the work of Barracchini and Addessi [3] from a theoretical construct to an approach which can be applied by practitioners. In order to make a workable method, this paper uses conventional portfolio analysis (which focus on risk and return), combined with principal components analysis in order to minimize the risk of a portfolio. It adopts a specific functional form for the saver’s utility function, to assess which assets appears most de sirable using that person’s values.   </p...|$|R

500|$|Following {{offers from}} Newcastle United and West Ham United, Barton joined Newcastle on 14 June 2007 {{for a fee}} of £5.8million. The {{contract}} negotiations had become protracted after Manchester City refused to pay Barton a fee of £300,000 {{to which he was}} reported to be entitled if he left the club without submitting a request for transfer. Newcastle United consequently raised their initial offer of £5.5million to £5.8, in effect compensating Manchester City for the £300,000 discrepancy. He said that his desire to win trophies helped him to make the decision, along with his admiration for manager Sam Allardyce. Barton made his Newcastle debut in a friendly against Hartlepool United on 17 July 2007. Four days later, he was ruled out for six to seven weeks after fracturing the fifth metatarsal bone in his left foot during a friendly match with Carlisle United. He was ruled out for a further month in October 2007. He eventually made his Premier League debut for Newcastle on 22 October 2007, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 3–1 win over Tottenham. During his first Tyne–Wear derby for Newcastle against Sunderland, Barton appeared to raise his foot dangerously in a challenge with Sunderland's Dickson Etuhu, leading to the News of the World <b>running</b> with the <b>headline</b> [...] "Ban Him". However, the FA were unable to charge Barton for the incident because match official Martin Atkinson had seen the act take place in the match, and had taken no action. FIFA regulations dictate that a retrospective charge for violent conduct can be made only if the match official did not notice the incident. Barton later apologised for the tackle. Early in December, he called for Newcastle fans to give the team more time after their abuse of manager Sam Allardyce, calling them [...] "vicious". He later played this down, saying his comments had been misrepresented.|$|R
