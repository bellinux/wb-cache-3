The consequences for the agricultural producers in West and southern Africa are in the centre of interest.

The charge may seem surprising insofar as China, contrary to most countries with a VAT system, does not fully rebate the VAT on exports. Instead, exporters may receive VAT rebates that vary across commodities, and range from zero to the full refund of the typical 17 % VAT rate. The Chinese VAT system thus imposes a tax on exporters whose goods receive a VAT <b>refund</b> <b>rate</b> lower than the applicable VAT rate. Two features have been highlighted as evidence that this VAT rebate system is nevertheless a systematic form of export management, providing Chinese exporters with an advantage with respect to foreign competitors.

40|$|The usual sale of European {{agricultural}} products to Africa using export refunds has been heavily discussed in recent decades. At {{the centre of}} the discussion are the consequences on the agricultural producers in Western and Southern Africa. There are two different points of view: On the one hand, the European Union's (EU) export policy reduces the prices on these markets and relieves high burdens on local producers; on the other hand are claims that refunds do not influence local prices significantly. Hence, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has no effect on markets of third countries, besides depressing world market prices. This paper focuses on the effects of EU's export subsidies for beef exports on its market share in several developing countries.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to assess the anticipatory effects from importers' and exporters' side by examining the US-Canada softwood lumber disputes. Using a demand estimation technique, we find evidence of the importers' anticipation: importers were less sensitive to tariff rates under the AD duties compared to standard tariffs, which indicates that the importers increased their volume of imports anticipating the future refund. We further show that the importers adjusted their anticipation adaptively, in the sense that the anticipated <b>refund</b> <b>rate</b> evolved according to the most recent revised rate of an AD duty released in the determination of an administrative review. On the other hand, using a pass-through regression, we find evidence of the exporters' anticipation: the pass-through of the AD duties into export prices (boarder prices) is larger than that of standard tariffs by about 41 % after controlling for unobserved demand shocks. The result indicates that the exporters set their prices higher under the AD duties in order to raise the future refund, which in turn increase their future profits through the evolution of the importers' anticipation. ...|$|E

Unfortunately, these independent business groups, especially small and micro businesses that have low income are not easy to get capital or financing from the banking institutions due to lack of financial history.

There are some institutions in Indonesia that have already engaged in microfinancing, but none of them have maximized the use of internet technology, particularly the use of interactive and social media sites that have the ability as a catalyst and mobilizer of the mass. In this study, we would like to propose a microfinancing business model to fund micro-businesses involving donors/funders, volunteers, field partners, coaches and non-profit organizations that work together in the process of screening, supervising, and managing the use of funds.

The principal question addressed in the report is whether the system operates in a 'sound and transparent way'. The report found that 'while the Commission had most of the information necessary it was not always complete or up to date. It found that the Commission did not always have the information necessary to calculate 'the difference between the EU and world market price quotations'. For example, in the beef sector the Commission stated that it was not able to monitor well enough to determine whether the subsidies exceeded the difference between EU and world market price quotations, while in the dairy sector the Commission's own analysis of skimmed milk powder and whole milk powder price quotations showed that the subsidy exceeded the difference in quotations for significant periods covered by the audit. Overall the Court of Auditors concluded that 'the way the Commission set <b>refund</b> <b>rates</b> was insufficiently clear', particularly for beef, milk products {{and to a lesser extent}} cereals. However, it acknowledged that the Commission was in the process of making a number of changes based on the Court's observations.

40|$|Since 1994 the Treuhandanstalt has {{publicly}} put out for tender employment projects {{in accordance with}} § 249 h of the Employment Promotion Act and has allocated them on a competitive basis. As the allocation of these projects to private companies has always been called for but only rarely put into practice, the Treuhandanstalt therefore acts as a forerunner. The effects of this allocation process are {{the main focus of}} this article. With reference to the current discussion of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} active labour market policy, the requirements which have to be fulfilled for publicly supported employment and which provide the basis for the evaluation of the Treuhandanstalt's process of invitation to tender are named. The effects on the following requirements are discussed individually: efficiency and refunding, interlinking of labour market policy and regional structural policy and creation of transitions into the primary labour market, both on an individual and a project level. This analysis includes previously unpublished details from the Treuhandanstalt on their tendering process as well as results of interviews with experts. The results can be summarised as follows: - The inclusion of competition has a clearly positive effect on efficiency and the <b>refunding</b> <b>rate</b> of the projects. Decisive for this are economies and the reduction of displacement and substitution effects. - The process reinforces the interlinking of labour market policy and regional structural policy in the first place through procedural integration of central parties. - On the individual level, transitions into regular employment could be promoted amongst other things through the effects of acquaintance and reputation. From the data available, however, this effect does not seem to differ greatly from projects which were not put out to tender. - On the project level, possibilities of transition into the primary labour market, for example through setting up small businesses, are judged with scepticism. Although the tendering process does in principle create favourable conditions, the possibilities of setting up small businesses appear to be limited, as the market potential in restoration, demolition and dismantling work is largely exhausted. The concluding chapter is devoted to the question of the applicability of the Treuhand model for a larger sphere of labour promotion projects. § 249 designates an employment subsidy for work in the fields of environment, social services and youth assistance.

This has highly negatively affected revenue collection on VAT. Descriptive research design was used to gather data using questionnaires and interviews as research instruments.
