5|$|Under the {{influence}} of the collapsing of the Eastern Bloc, on 10 November 1989 the Communist Party gave up its political monopoly, Zhivkov resigned, and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy. The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, the freshly renamed Communist Party). A new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991. The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth—the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s. A 1997 <b>reform</b> <b>package</b> restored economic growth, but living standards continued to suffer. After 2001 economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly, and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status. It became a member of NATO in 2004 and participated in the War in Afghanistan. After several years of reforms it joined the European Union in 2007 despite continued concerns about government corruption.|$|E

The Russian {{economic transformation}} {{is a fascinating}} story on many grounds. When the Soviet Union disintegrated at the end 1991, the new question pervaded the West was how to integrate the post-communist Russia into the international community, politically and economically. As to the economic transformation and integration, the economists and other intellectuals produced an enormous literature on how to convert centrally planned socialist economies into capitalist market economies. Many Russian and foreigners, who have dedicated large energies to the economic transformation of Russia in its first years, argued that Russia {{would end up in}} economic growth if it followed the proposed <b>reform</b> <b>packages.</b> Although Russia realized many proposed <b>reform</b> <b>packages,</b> it ended up in economic failure. This master thesis strives to explain the Russian economic transformation between 1992 - 1995 and its assessment or perception in the West. Kocaman, ÖmerM. S...|$|R

The Senate rejected prohibiting legislators from paying their families with campaign funds with some saying it was unrelated to the current legislation and others that the payments were not a problem. Additionally, they tabled his proposal to define Indian tribes as corporations and its members as stockholders {{so that they are}} required to contribute to candidates through political action committees instead of their tribal treasury.
