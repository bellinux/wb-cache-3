40|$|Ataxia {{telangiectasia}} (A-T) {{cells are}} sensitive to {{a broad range of}} free-radical-producing and alkylating agents. Damage caused by such agents is in part repaired by base excision [base excision repair (BER) ]. Two BER pathways have been demonstrated in mammalian cells: a single-nucleotide-insertion pathway and a long-patch pathway involving resynthesis of 2 - 10 nucleotides. Although early studies failed to detect DNA-repair defects in A-T cells exposed to ionizing radiation and <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agents,</b> more recent experiments performed in non-dividing A-T cells and the demonstrated interaction of the A-T-mutated protein (ATM) with the BRCA 1 gene product suggest that a DNA-repair defect may underlie, at least in part, the radiation sensitivity in A-T cells. We have analysed BER of a single abasic site or a single uracil in two A-T families, using an in vitro BER system. In both families, the mutation involved was homozygous and completely inactivated the ATM protein. No difference was observed between affected individuals and heterozygous or homozygous wild-type relatives in their capacity to perform DNA repair by either one-nucleotide insertion or the long-patch pathway.

40|$|The {{breast cancer}} {{susceptibility}} protein, BRCA 2, preserves chromosomal stability through {{roles in the}} repair of DNA double-strand breaks, and possibly, cell division. Post-translational modifications that may coordinate these functions remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that BRCA 2 is a substrate for the mitotic Polo-like kinase, Plk 1. BRCA 2 undergoes phosphorylation in cells synchronously passing through the G 2 /M phases of cell cycle, when Plk 1 expression and activity are maximal. Depletion of Plk 1 by RNA interference suppresses BRCA 2 modification. BRCA 2 and Plk 1 {{interact with one another}} in cell lysates, through a conserved region in BRCA 2, which spans the eight BRC repeat motifs essential for its function in DNA repair. Within this region, residues positioned between BRC repeats [...] but not the repeat motifs themselves [...] are phosphorylated by Plk 1. Interestingly, Plk 1 -mediated modification of BRCA 2 during the G 2 /M phases is inhibited by treatment with the <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agent,</b> adriamycin.

The survival curves of all strains examined were similar in shape to corresponding survival curves after ultraviolet radiation. The sensitivity to nitrous acid of the radiosensitive strains S and B, but not that of the radioresistant strains, was found to be greater on Tryptone medium than on Penassay medium, and greater on Penassay medium than on glucose-salts medium. Between 2 and 3 % of the strain S survivors of nitrous acid treatment were radioresistant; 46 such radioresistant mutants were isolated and found to be identical in cross-resistance pattern with radioresistant types (R 3, R 4, or R 6) previously described.

40|$|Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a multisystem {{recessive}} disease characterized clinically by cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, immunodeficiency, sensitivity to <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agents,</b> and cancer predisposition. This pleiotropic disorder {{is caused by}} mutations in the ATM (mutated in A-T) gene, which {{is located in the}} human chromosomal region 11 q 22 -q 23. The ATM gene product is a member of a novel family of large proteins implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and response to DNA damage. Heterozygosity for A-T was previously suggested to be associated with an increased risk of tumors, particularly female breast cancer. Because of loss of constitutional heterozygosity at 11 q 22 -q 23 is a frequent event in breast and other tumors, suggesting the presence of a tumor suppressor gene(s) in this region, we screened blood DNA samples from 88 unrelated breast cancer patients of Swedish cancer families for ATM mutations using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. All patients had a family history of tumors previously associated with A-T heterozygosity or homozygosity. We demonstrate the first three germ-line mutations in ATM identified by screening of breast cancer patients. Two mutations were previously found in A-T homozygotes and one mutation was a 1 -bp insertion. All mutations were found in families with a large number of tumors, however, they did not cosegregate with malignancies. Although the proportion of A-T carriers in this sample seems to be higher than expected by chance, larger studies and pooled data sets will be required to establish that an A-T allele confers cancer susceptibility in heterozygotes...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a general new approach for identifying recessive mutations that affect diploid {{strains of yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{and the application of}} this method to the identification of mutations that confer an intermediate block in meiotic prophase chromosome metabolism. The method uses a temperature-sensitive conjugation mutation ste 7 - 1 in combination with homothallism. The mutations of interest confer a defect in spore formation that is dependent upon a gene required for initiation of meiotic recombination and development of meiosis-specific chromosome structure (SPO 11). Identified in this screen were null mutations of the DMC 1 gene, nonnull mutations of RAD 50 (rad 50 S), and mutations in three new genes designated SAE 1, SAE 2 and SAE 3 (Sporulation in the Absence of Spo Eleven). Molecular characterization of the SAE 2 gene and characterization of meiotic and mitotic phenotypes of sae 2 mutants are also presented. The phenotypes conferred by a sae 2 null mutation are virtually indistinguishable from those conferred by the previously identified nonnull mutations of RAD 50 (rad 50 S). Most notably, both mutations confer only weak sensitivity to the <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agent</b> methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) but completely block resection and turnover of meiosis-specific double-strand breaks. These observations provide further evidence that this constellation of phenotypes identifies a specific molecular function...|$|E

To determine the susceptibility of DS lymphocytes at G 2 phase, bleomycin, a <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agent,</b> was used to induce DNA breaks in blood cultures from 24 Down syndrome patients. All the patients with DS showed free trisomy 21 (47,XX + 21 or 47,XY + 21).

No control child showed susceptibility to bleomycin, and among the 24 patients with DS, only one was sensitive to the drug. No significant difference was observed between the two groups, regarding chromatid break frequencies in treated G 2 lymphocytes. The distribution of bleomycin-induced breaks in each group of chromosomes was similar for DS and controls. No significant difference was found in the response to bleomycin between male and female subjects.

The use of natural dietary antioxidants {{to reduce the risk}} of radiation-induced oxidative DNA damage is a simple strategy for minimizing radiation-related cancer rates and improving overall health. The onion is among the richest sources of dietary flavonoids and is an important food for increasing their overall intake. Therefore, we examined the effect of an onion extract on cyto- and geno-toxicity in human lymphocytes treated with bleomycin (BLM), a <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agent.</b> In addition, we measured the frequency of micronuclei (MN) and DNA damage following treatment with BLM using a cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay and a single cell gel electrophoresis assay.

The frequency of BLM induced MN and DNA damage increased in a dose-dependent manner; however, when lymphocytes were pretreated with onion extract (10 and 20 μL/mL), the frequency of BLM-induced MN was decreased at all doses of BLM and DNA damage was decreased at 3 μg/mL of BLM.

40|$|The p 53 tumor {{suppressor}} protein, a key regulator {{of cellular}} responses to genotoxic stress, is stabilized and activated after DNA damage. The rapid activation of p 53 by ionizing radiation and <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agents</b> is largely {{dependent on the}} ATM kinase. p 53 is phosphorylated by ATM shortly after DNA damage, resulting in enhanced stability and activity of p 53. The Mdm 2 oncoprotein is a pivotal negative regulator of p 53. In response to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs, Mdm 2 undergoes rapid ATM-dependent phosphorylation prior to p 53 accumulation. This results in a decrease in its reactivity with the 2 A 10 monoclonal antibody. Phage display analysis identified a consensus 2 A 10 recognition sequence, possessing the core motif DYS. Unexpectedly, this motif appears twice within the human Mdm 2 molecule, at positions corresponding to residues 258 – 260 and 393 – 395. Both putative 2 A 10 epitopes are highly conserved and encompass potential phosphorylation sites. Serine 395, residing within the carboxy-terminal 2 A 10 epitope, is the major target on Mdm 2 for phosphorylation by ATM in vitro. Mutational analysis supports the conclusion that Mdm 2 undergoes ATM-dependent phosphorylation on serine 395 in vivo in response to DNA damage. The data further suggests that phosphorylated Mdm 2 may be less capable of promoting the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of p 53 and its subsequent degradation, thereby enabling p 53 accumulation. Our findings imply that activation of p 53 by DNA damage is achieved, in part, through attenuation of the p 53 -inhibitory potential of Mdm 2...|$|R
40|$|Although {{radiation}} carcinogenesis {{has been shown}} both experimentally and epidemiologically, the use of ionizing radiation {{is also one of}} the major modalities in cancer treatment. Various known cellular and molecular events are involved in carcinogenesis. Apart from the known phenomena, there could be implications for carcinogenesis and cancer prevention due to other biological processes such as the bystander effect, the abscopal effect, intrinsic radiosensitivity and radioadaptation. Bystander effects have consequences for mutation initiated cancer paradigms of {{radiation carcinogenesis}}, which provide the mechanistic justification for low-dose risk estimates. The abscopal effect is potentially important for tumor control and is mediated through cytokines and/or the immune system (mainly cell-mediated immunity). It results from loss of growth and stimulatory and/or immunosuppressive factors from the tumor. Intrinsic radiosensitivity is a feature of some cancer prone chromosomal breakage syndromes such as ataxia telangectiasia. Radiosensitivity is manifested as higher chromosomal aberrations and DNA repair impairment is now known as a good biomarker for breast cancer screening and prediction of prognosis. However, it is not yet known whether this effect is good or bad for those receiving radiation or <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agents</b> for treatment. Radiation hormesis is another major concern for carcinogenesis. This process which protects cells from higher doses of radiation or radio mimic chemicals, may lead to the escape of cells from mitotic death or apoptosis and put cells with a lower amount of damage into the process of cancer induction. Therefore, any of these biological phenomena could have impact on another process giving rise to genome instability of cells which are not in the field of radiation but still receiving a lower amount of radiation. For prevention of radiation induced carcinogenesis or risk assessment as well as for successful radiation therapy, all these phenomena should be taken into account...|$|R
40|$|DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are {{critical}} DNA lesions, which threaten genome stability and cell survival. DSBs are directly induced by ionizing radiation (IR) and <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agents,</b> including the cytolethal distending toxin (CDT). This bacterial genotoxin harbors a unique DNase-I-like endonuclease activity. Here we studied {{the role of}} DSBs induced by CDT and IR as a trigger of autophagy, which is a cellular degradation process involved in cell homeostasis, genome protection and cancer. The regulatory mechanisms of DSB-induced autophagy were analyzed, focusing on the ATM-p 53 -mediated DNA damage response and AKT signaling in colorectal cancer cells. We show that treatment of cells with CDT or IR increased the levels of the autophagy marker LC 3 B-II. Consistently, an enhanced formation of autophagosomes and a decrease of the autophagy substrate p 62 were observed. Both CDT and IR concomitantly suppressed mTOR signaling and stimulated the autophagic flux. DSBs were demonstrated as the primary trigger of autophagy using a DNase I-defective CDT mutant, which neither induced DSBs nor autophagy. Genetic abrogation of p 53 and inhibition of ATM signaling impaired the autophagic flux as revealed by LC 3 B-II accumulation and reduced formation of autophagic vesicles. Blocking of DSB-induced apoptotic cell death by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD stimulated autophagy. In line with this, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy increased cell death, while ATG 5 knockdown did not affect cell death after DSB induction. Interestingly, both IR and CDT caused AKT activation, which repressed DSB-triggered autophagy independent of the cellular DNA-PK status. Further knockdown and pharmacological inhibitor experiments provided evidence that the negative autophagy regulation was largely attributable to AKT 2. Finally, we show that upregulation of CDT-induced autophagy upon AKT inhibition resulted in lower apoptosis and increased cell viability. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that DSBs trigger pro-survival autophagy in an ATM- and p 53 -dependent manner, which is curtailed by AKT 2 signaling...|$|R
40|$|DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can {{be induced}} endogenously and by {{exposure}} to ionizing radiation, and they represent {{one of the most}} deleterious forms of DNA damage. To avoid genomic stability arising from DNA DSBs, cells employ DNA damage response (DDR) pathways to detect and promptly repair DNA DSBs. In mammalian cells, the DDR pathway involves a cascade of events of protein recruitments and chromatin modifications near the damaged regions of DNA. An important chromatin modification known to occur during this process is the ubiquitination of histone H 2 A and H 2 AX by the E 3 ubiquitin ligase RNF 168. Herein, we identified, for the first time, the phosphorylation of serine 97 in RNF 168, and we found that the level of this phosphorylation was significantly increased in cultured human cells upon exposure to γ rays or a <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agent,</b> neocarzinostatin. Additionally, the introduction of S 97 A or S 97 D mutation to RNF 168 substantially reduced the protein’s ubiquitination activity in cells, diminished the efficiency of DNA DSB repair via the non-homologous end-joining pathway, and rendered cells more sensitive toward ionizing radiation. Together, phosphorylation of S 97 in RNF 168 plays {{a significant role in the}} cellular tolerance and repair of DNA DSBs. Thus, our study provided important insights into the post-translational regulation of RNF 168 in DNA damage response...|$|E

Previously, an increased expression of Sin 3 B and tumour suppressor protein, p 53 has been established upon adriamycin treatment. We, now provide evidence that Sin 3 B expression is significantly up-regulated under variety of stress conditions and this response is not stress-type specific. We observed that Sin 3 B expression is significantly up-regulated both at transcript and at protein level upon DNA damage induced by bleomycin drug, a <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agent.</b> This increase in Sin 3 B expression upon stress {{is found to be}} p 53 -dependent and is associated with enhanced interaction of Sin 3 B with Ser 15 phosphorylated p 53. Binding of Sin 3 –HDAC repressor complex on to the promoters of p 53 target genes influences gene regulation by altering histone modifications (H 3 K 9 me 3 and H 3 K 27 me 3) at target genes. Furthermore, knockdown of Sin 3 B by shRNA severely compromises p 53 -mediated gene repression under stress conditions. Taken together, these results suggest that stress-induced Sin 3 B activation is p 53 -dependent and is essential for p 53 -mediated repression of its selective target genes. The present study has an implication in understanding the transrepression mechanism of p 53 under DNA damaging conditions.

Two clones of B-lymphoma cells were studied, one expressing wild-type (wt) p 53 and the other expressing mutated p 53. Jasmonic acid and methyl jasmonate (0. 25 – 3 [*]mM) were each equally cytotoxic to both clones, whereas mutant p 53 -expressing cells were resistant to treatment with the <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agent</b> neocarzinostatin and the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin. Neocarzinostatin and bleomycin induced an elevation in the p 53 levels in wt p 53 -expressing cells, whereas methyl jasmonate did not. Methyl jasmonate induced mostly apoptotic death in the wt p 53 -expressing cells, while no signs of early apoptosis were detected in mutant p 53 -expressing cells. In contrast, neocarzinostatin and bleomycin induced death only in wt p 53 -expressing cells, in an apoptotic mode. Methyl jasmonate induced a rapid depletion of ATP in both clones. In both clones, oligomycin (a mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor) did not increase ATP depletion induced by methyl jasmonate, whereas inhibition of glycolysis with 2 -deoxyglucose did. High glucose levels protected both clones from methyl jasmonate-induced ATP depletion (and reduced methyl jasmonate-induced cytotoxicity), whereas high levels of pyruvate did not. These results suggest that methyl jasmonate induces ATP depletion mostly by compromising oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria.

40|$|The {{nitrogen}} mustard bis(β-chloroethyl) methylamine, a <b>radiomimetic</b> alkylating <b>agent,</b> {{is known for}} its ability to inactivate viruses in general and poxvirus in particular. These experiments show that vaccinia virus is rapidly inactivated by it. They show, in addition, that the treated virus exhibits multiplicity reactivation in L cells, closely resembling that experienced with the same virus after exposure to ultraviolet rays. These findings have come from observations of plaque titer, on the one hand, and virus particle aggregation (measured in the electron microscope), on the other. The titer of the treated virus is very sensitive to particle aggregation, increasing and decreasing in a reversible manner as the degree of clumping among the particles is changed. The magnitude of these changes is such that they must be considered in any situation involving plaque assay of the fraction of virus surviving treatment with {{nitrogen mustard}}...|$|R
40|$|The {{developments}} {{in the use of}} the nitrogen "mustards" as chemotherapeutic agents are discussed against the back-ground or the general chemotherapy of cancer. Their cytotoxic activity, for which different mechanisms have been advanced, presents the possibility of using the nitrogen "mustards" to Inhibit the growth of tumours and the development of the various lymphadenopathies the aromatic series of chloroalkylmines was prepared in the search for active growth inhibitors of lower toxicity than the original aliphatic nitrogen "mustards" and the syntheses described in this thesis extend that series. The attempts to elucidate the mode of action of these compounds by seeking correlation between chemical reactivity and physiological activity underlies the sections that deal with the reactions of the halogenoalkylamines. The mode of hydrolysis of the chloroethylamines and the evidence supporting an SN 1 mechanism are discussed, Their hydrolysis rates are compared with their structures and the effects of substituents of the aromatic nucleus are interpreted in terms of the electron-attracting or -releasing character of those substituents. the differing rates of hydrolysisresulting from the exchange of one halogen by another were investigated by following reactions in the presence of thiosulphate, when it became apparent that la the case of the iodo-compounds hydrolysis is of a complex nature, the experimental results being accounted for by assuming simultaneous SN 1 and SN 2 machanisms. The reactions of the nitrogen "mustards" with primary amines to give 1 : 4 -dioubstituted piperazines is demonstrated and the biological significance of this reaction is discussed. In the third section on the reactions of the aryl- 2 -halogonolkylamies, the stability of the derived esters to alkaline hydrolysis is measured and comparison made with simple esters and esters derived from other <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agents</b> - epoxides and sulphur "mustards". The results of biological tests of the compounds whose syntheses were described are recorded in the final chapter and the degree of correlation between activity and chemical properties is discussed. <p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) {{can occur}} in {{response}} to ionizing radiation (IR), <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agents</b> and from endogenous DNA-damaging reactive oxygen metabolites. Unrepaired or improperly repaired DSBs are potentially the most lethal form of DNA damage and can result in chromosomal translocations {{and contribute to the}} development of cancer. The principal mechanism for the repair of DSBs in humans is non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Ku is a key member of the NHEJ pathway and plays an important role in the recognition step when it binds to free DNA termini. Ku then stimulates the assembly and activation of other NHEJ components. DNA binding of Ku is regulated by redox conditions and evidence from our laboratory has demonstrated that Ku undergoes structural changes when oxidized that results in a reduction in DNA binding activity. The C-terminal domain and cysteine 493 of Ku 80 were investigated for their contribution to redox regulation of Ku. Results We effectively removed the C-terminal domain of Ku 80 generating a truncation mutant and co-expressed this variant with wild type Ku 70 in an insect cell system to create a Ku 70 / 80 ΔC heterodimer. We also generated two single amino acid variants of Cys 493, replacing this amino acid with either an alanine (C 493 A) or a serine (C 493 S), and over-expressed the variant proteins in SF 9 insect cells in complex with wild type Ku 70. Neither the truncation nor the amino acid substitutions alters protein expression or stability as determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. We show that the C 493 mutations do not alter the ability of Ku to bind duplex DNA in vitro under reduced conditions while truncation of the Ku 80 C-terminus slightly reduced DNA binding affinity. Diamide oxidation of cysteines was shown to inhibit DNA binding similarly for both the wild-type and all variant proteins. Interestingly, differential DNA binding activity following re-reduction was observed for the Ku 70 / 80 ΔC truncation mutant. Conclusion Together, these results suggest that the C-terminal domain and C 493 of Ku 80 play at most a minor role in the redox regulation of Ku, and that other cysteines are likely involved, either alone or in conjunction with these regions of Ku 80. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{antibiotic}} bleomycin (BLM) is an anticancer drug {{used for}} the treatment of a variety of tumors. Similarly to ionizing radiations, its cytotoxic activity is mainly related to the generation of oxygen radicals and, for this reason, BLM is classified as a <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agent.</b> Here we describe the influence or either the mismatch repair system (MMR) or p 53 on cell cycle alterations, apoptosis and chromosomal damage induced by BLM. The MMR-deficient colon carcinoma cell line HCTI 16 and its MMR-proficient subline HCTlI 6 / 3 - 6, both expressing wild-type p 53,were transfected with a vector encoding a dominant-negative p 53 mutant, or with an empty vector. Four transfected clones having the following phenotypes: MMR-proficient/p 53 wild-type, MMR-proficient/p 53 mutant, MMR-deficient/p 53 wild-type and MMR-deficient/p 53 mutant were selected and subjected to BLM treatment. Loss of p 53 alone resulted in abrogation of BLM-induced G 1 arrest and a higher accumulation of cells in the G 2 /M phase. Inactivation of p 53 was also associated with increased cell sensitivity to apoptosis and chromosomal damage induced by the drug. Loss of MMR function alone was associated with increased cell resistance to G 2 /M arrest, apoptosis and chromosomal damage caused by bleomycin. Disabling both p 53 and MMR function led to abrogation of BLM-induced G 1 arrest and to impairment of drug-induced apoptosis, which was however less pronounced than that observed in the MMR deficient/p 53 wild-type clone. Chromosomal damage in BLM-treated MMR-deficient clones was lower than in MMR-proficient ones both at 3 and 48 hours after treatment. In conclusion, our data show that the functional status of both the MMR system and p 53 influences cellular responses to bleomycin, being MMR-proficient/p 53 mutant cells the most sensitive and MMR-deficient/p 53 wild-type cells the most resistant to the drug...|$|E
40|$|Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a {{processivity factor}} for DNA polymerases δ and ɛ, is {{involved}} in DNA replication {{as well as in}} diverse DNA repair pathways. In quiescent cells, UV light-induced bulky DNA damage triggers the transition of PCNA from a soluble to an insoluble chromatin-bound form, which is intimately associated with the repair synthesis by polymerases δ and ɛ. In this study, we investigated the efficiency of PCNA complex formation in response to ionizing radiation-induced DNA strand breaks in normal and radiation-sensitive Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cells by immunofluorescence and western blot techniques. Exposure of normal cells to γ-rays rapidly triggered the formation of PCNA foci in a dose-dependent manner in the nuclei and the PCNA foci (40 – 45 %) co-localized with sites of repair synthesis detected by bromodeoxyuridine labeling. The chromatin-bound PCNA gradually declined with increasing post-irradiation times and almost reached the level of unirradiated cells by 6 h. The PCNA foci formed after γ-irradiation was resistant to high salt extraction and the chromatin association of PCNA was lost after DNase I digestion. Interestingly, two radiosensitive primary fibroblast cell lines, derived from AT patients harboring homozygous mutations in the ATM gene, displayed an efficient PCNA redistribution after γ-irradiation. We also analyzed the PCNA complex induced by a <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agent,</b> Bleomycin (BLM), which produces predominantly single- and double-strand DNA breaks. The efficiency and the time course of PCNA complex induced by BLM were identical in both normal and AT cells. Our study demonstrates {{for the first time that}} the ATM gene product is not required for PCNA complex assembly in response to DNA strand breaks. Additionally, we observed an increased interaction of PCNA with the Ku 70 and Ku 80 heterodimer after DNA damage, suggestive of a role for PCNA in the non-homologous end-joining repair pathway of DNA strand breaks...|$|E
40|$|Space {{radiation}} {{consists of}} proton and helium from solar particle events (SPE) and high energy heavy ions from galactic cosmic ray (GCR). This mixture of radiation with particles at different energy levels has different effects on biological systems. Currently, majority studies of radiation effects on human {{were based on}} single-source radiation due to the limitation of available method to model effects of space radiation on living organisms. While NASA Space Radiation Laboratory is working on advanced switches {{to make it possible}} to have a mixed field radiation with particles of different energies, the radiation source will be limited. Development of an easily available experimental model for studying effects of mixed field radiation could greatly speed up our progress in our understanding the molecular mechanisms of damage and responses from exposure to space radiation, and facilitate the discovery of protection and countermeasures against space radiation, which is critical for the mission to Mars. Bleomycin, a <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agent,</b> has been widely used to study radiation induced DNA damage and cellular responses. Previously, bleomycin was often compared to low low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) gamma radiation without defined characteristics. Our recent work demonstrated that bleomycin could induce complex clustered DNA damage in human fibroblasts that is similar to DNA damage induced by high LET radiation. These type of DNA damage is difficult to repair and can be visualized by gamma-H 2 Ax staining weeks after the initial insult. The survival ratio between early and late plating of human fibroblasts after bleomycin treatment is between low LET and high LET radiation. Our results suggest that bleomycin induces DNA damage and other cellular stresses resembling those resulted from mixed field radiation with both low and high LET particles. We hypothesize that bleomycin could be used to mimic space radiation in biological systems. Potential advantages and limitations of using bleomycin to treat biological specimen as an easily available model to study effects of space radiation on biological systems and to develop countermeasures for space radiation associated risks will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) DNA {{double strand}} breaks (DSB) {{are among the}} most lethal forms of DNA damage and can occur as a result of {{ionizing}} radiation (IR), <b>radiomimetic</b> <b>agents,</b> endogenous DNA-damaging agents, etc. If left unrepaired DSB’s can cause cell death, chromosome translocation and carcinogenesis. In humans, DSB are repaired predominantly by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Ku, a heterodimer consisting of Ku 70 and Ku 80, functions in the recognition step of this pathway through binding DNA termini. Ku recruits the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) to create the full DNA-PK heterotrimer. Formation of DNA-PK results in autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of downstream proteins of the NHEJ pathway. Previous work shows that the extreme C-terminus of Ku 80 stimulates the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs, and Ku DNA binding is regulated as a function of redox via stimulation of a conformational change when oxidized resulting in a decrease in DNA binding activity. To further understand these methods of regulation of Ku and DNA-PK, a pair of mutants has been constructed; one consisting of full length Ku 70 and truncated Ku 80 (Ku 70 / 80 ΔC) lacking 182 C-terminal amino acids. The removal of these amino acids was shown to have little to no effect on the proteins expression, stability or DNA binding, as determined by SDS-PAGE, western blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). When oxidized Ku 70 / 80 ΔC showed a decrease in DNA binding similar to that seen in wild type, however when re-reduced the mutant did not recover to the same extent as wild type. A second mutant was constructed, containing amino acids 590 - 732 of Ku 80 (Ku 80 CTR), to further understand the mechanism by which Ku 80 C-terminus interacts {{with the rest of the}} Ku heterodimer. Possible protein-protein interactions were evaluated by Ni-NTA affinity, gel filtration chromatography, fluorescence polarization and two forms of protein-protein cross-linking. Ni-NTA agarose affinity, and gel filtration chromatography failed to reveal an interaction in the presence or absence of DNA. However, photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) as well as EDC cross-linking demonstrated an interaction which was not affected by DNA. The work presented here demonstrates that the interaction between Ku 80 CTR and Ku is rather weak, but it does exist and plays a relatively large role in the NHEJ pathway...|$|R
40|$|A major DNA lesion is the {{strongly}} mutagenic 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydroguanine (8 -oxoG) base, {{formed by}} oxidative attack at guanine and {{which leads to}} a high level of G. C [...] >T. A transversions. Clustered DNA damages are formed in DNA following exposure to ionizing radiation or <b>radiomimetic</b> anticancer <b>agents</b> and are thought to be biologically severe. The presence of 8 -oxoG within clustered DNA damage may present a challenge to the repair machinery of the cell, if the OGG 1 DNA glycosylase/AP lyase protein, present in eukaryotic cells, does not efficiently excise its substrate, 8 -oxoG. In this study, specific oligonucleotide constructs containing an 8 -oxoG located in several positions opposite to another damage (5, 6 -dihydrothymine (DHT), uracil, 8 -oxoG, AP site, or various types of single strand breaks) were used to determine the relative efficiency of purified human OGG 1 and mammalian XRS 5 nuclear extracts to excise 8 -oxoG from clustered damages. A base damage (DHT, uracil, and 8 -oxoG) on the opposite strand has little or no influence on the rate of excision of 8 -oxoG whereas the presence of either an AP site or various types of single strand breaks has a strong inhibitory effect on the formation of a SSB due to the excision of 8 -oxoG by both hOGG 1 and the nuclear extract. The binding of hOGG 1 to 8 -oxoG is not significantly affected by the presence of a neighboring lesion...|$|R
40|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} and <b>radiomimetic</b> anticancer <b>agents</b> induce clustered DNA damages that {{are thought to}} lead to deleterious biological consequences, due to the challenge that clustered damage may present to the repair machinery of the cell. Specific oligonucleotides, containing either dihydrothymine (DHT) or 7, 8 -dihydro- 8 -oxoguanine (8 -oxoG) opposite to specific lesions at defined positions on the complementary strand, {{have been used to}} determine the kinetic constants, K(M), k(cat), and specificity constants, for excision of DHT and 8 -oxoG by the Escherichia coli base excision repair proteins, endonuclease III (Nth) and formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (Fpg), respectively. For excision of DHT opposite to 8 -oxoadenine by Nth or Fpg proteins, or 8 -oxoG opposite to 8 -oxoG by Fpg, the major change in the specificity constant occurs when the second lesion on the complementary strand is one base to the site opposite to DHT or 8 -oxoG. The specificity constants for excision of DHT or 8 -oxoG by both proteins are reduced by up to 2 orders of magnitude when an abasic site or a strand break is opposite on the complementary strand. Whereas the values of K(M) are only slightly affected by the presence of a second lesion, the major change is seen as a reduction in the values of k(cat). The binding of Fpg protein to oligonucleotides containing 8 -oxoG is inhibited, particularly when a single strand break is near to 8 -oxoG on the complementary strand. It is inferred that not only the binding affinity of Fpg protein to the base lesion but also the rate of excision of the damaged base is reduced by the presence of another lesion, particularly a single strand break or an AP site on the complementary strand...|$|R
