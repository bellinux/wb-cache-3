40|$|The shear {{behavior}} of fiber-reinforced-polymer–strengthened reinforced concrete (FRP-strengthened RC) members {{is not fully}} developed and accurately predicted {{because of the lack}} of accurate constitutive laws for the components of the composite members. This paper presents experimental and analytical investigations of tensile stress-strain relationships of concrete and steel in FRP-strengthened RC members.

The Maxwell element is built up of a parallel arrangement of the resistor Ra and the capacitor Ca and the series connection of the resistor Rb and the capacitor Cb. It {{is well known that}} the same impedance data can be described by several corresponding equivalent circuits. All possible arrangements starting from various Voigt model arrangements over Maxwell model arrangements have been evaluated. The chosen Maxwell model was the best-suited model to describe and explain the recorded impedance data most consistently for two reasons. The first reason is, it is shown in literature [15, 17] that the Co deposition can occur via at least two reaction pathways. The second reason is that the decoupling of the seven fit parameters vs. time is best for the chosen Maxwell model in comparison to other investigated equivalent circuit models as will be discussed in the following.|$|R

30|$|The {{experimental}} study of <b>RC</b> <b>elements</b> under earthquake loads is very important since it permits the observation and measurement of the particular performance of the element. Regarding the behaviour of <b>RC</b> <b>elements</b> under lateral loads, {{a large number of}} various types of studies have been carried out in past years which, apart from the specific subject of each study, have generally covered elements with or without axial loads, as well as uniaxial and biaxial bending. In the case of zero axial force, these studies are typically associated with beams; therefore, most of them focus only on the uniaxial behaviour of these elements. Columns are studied with non-zero axial load, constant or variable, under uniaxial or biaxial bending. In the case of slender elements, the behaviour is governed by flexure, but depending on the cross-section geometry and the shear span ratio, the shear force can also represent an important subject for the study. Studies of <b>RC</b> <b>elements</b> can, therefore, also be divided into elements where the global behaviour is governed essentially by flexure or by shear, or by both mechanisms.|$|E

30|$|The {{performance}} of reinforced concrete (<b>RC)</b> <b>element</b> may be deficient {{for a variety}} of causes. Correct actions should be taken to resume the {{performance of}} the deficient element to maintain the strength and serviceability of the structure. A deficient <b>RC</b> column <b>element</b> may be identified in the form of spalling of concrete cover. A patching method could be selected to recover the damaged area and, hopefully, regain the strength of the damaged RC column to its original value. This research aims to investigate the suitability of patch repair material to recover the performance of damaged RC column. The investigation is carried out by comparing the behaviour of patched RC columns with the corresponding normal RC column. The eccentric loading has been set up in this investigation to induce compression failure of the RC columns. The simulated area of damage is patched using unsaturated polyester resin mortar (UPR mortar). The results indicate that the mode of failure is not induced at the patched sections. The presence of patching causes a redistribution of stress at the patched section in such a way, so a higher stress transfer occurs in the undamaged zone and in the longitudinal reinforcements compared to those of the normal column. The capacity of the patched RC columns is only 71 – 92 % of the normal RC column.|$|R
40|$|The shear {{design and}} {{behavior}} of a typical membrane reinforced concrete (RC) element has been extensively studied {{in the past several}} decades. Such design requires knowledge of the constitutive behavior of <b>RC</b> <b>elements</b> subjected to a shear stress acting along its plane (in-plane shear). These constitutive models were accurately derived from experimental test data on representative RC panel elements. The true behavior of many large, complex structures, however, involves interaction between the in-plane and out-of-plane shear stresses acting on the RC element. To investigate this interaction, large-scale tests on representative concrete panels need to be conducted. The University of Houston is equipped with a unique universal panel testing machine that was used for this purpose.

Natural frequencies are governed by {{the relationship between the}} physical properties of <b>RC</b> <b>elements</b> and its composite action.

The bonding action between steel and concrete under loading and unloading conditions is also taken into account. The assumption of the increase in stiffness of <b>RC</b> <b>elements</b> in tension due to bond action is investigated by tests on two RC beams. Both static and modal testing were carried out after inducing different levels of damage in the beams. Results show the validity of the assumption made due to composite action. Mode 1 can be an indicator for bond action behavior and for predicting the yield state of steel in the RC beams. Mode 2 behavior is governed by the amount of steel reinforcement, where for maximum steel ratio it will be affected by concrete softening, while for minimum steel ratio it will be affected by both concrete softening and bond action.

BackgroundRenin is a rate-limiting enzyme for activity of the circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and expression of the renin gene is regulated {{by a variety of}} stimuli. In this study, we examined a possible role of c-Jun in the transcription of renin gene. MethodsThe renin promoter, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), fusion genes with or without c-Jun expression vector (pSV-c-Jun) were transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, and the effects of c-Jun were examined by deletion and mutation analyses of CAT assay and by in vitro transcription-primer extension assay. We also examined the effects of c-Jun on DNA-binding activity to the renin promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Furthermore, we examined the effects of c-Jun on transcription of the renin gene in enriched juxtaglomerular (JG) cells by cotransfection with pSV-c-Jun and by treatment with antisense c-jun oligodeoxynucleotides. ResultsPromoter activity of the renin gene was increased by c-Jun overexpression in HEK cells, and the proximal promoter region from - 47 to + 16 was sufficient for transcriptional activation by c-Jun. Although mutation of activator protein- 1 (AP- 1) element-like sequences in the proximal promoter did not affect c-Jun-mediated stimulation, mutation of the core promoter including the TATA box inhibited c-Jun-mediated transcription. The results of EMSA showed that c-Jun overexpression produced a binding of nuclear factor, which was HEK cell-specific and distinct from TATA box-binding protein and AP- 1 family transcription factor, to the renin core promoter region (<b>RC</b> <b>element)</b> from - 36 to - 20. The overexpression of c-Jun activated the renin promoter in renin-expressing JG cells, and antisense c-jun decreased the activity of renin promoter and expression of renin mRNA in JG cells.
