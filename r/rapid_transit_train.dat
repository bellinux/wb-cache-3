25|$|In the {{following}} years, {{real estate prices}} stabilized, mortgage money became available and The Southwest Corridor Coalition a task force of local citizens broken down by neighborhoods and aided by state officials, put together a comprehensive master plan to redevelop the corridor. They decided to remove the elevated <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> <b>train</b> line on Washington Street {{and replace it with}} a below-grade line alongside the train tracks. With the new transit lines in place following the old train embankment, the Southwest Corridor park was built from Forest Hills north through the old Stony Brook valley.|$|E
25|$|Oscar Grant III was a 22-year-old African-American {{man who was}} {{fatally shot}} {{in the early morning}} hours of New Year's Day 2009 by BART Police officer Johannes Mehserle in Oakland, California, United States. Responding to reports of a fight on a crowded Bay Area <b>Rapid</b> <b>Transit</b> <b>train</b> {{returning}} from San Francisco, BART Police officers detained Grant and several other passengers on the platform at the Fruitvale BART Station. Officer Johannes Mehserle and another officer had restrained Grant, forcing him to lie face down. Mehserle drew his pistol and shot Grant in the back. Grant was unarmed. He was pronounced dead the next morning at Highland Hospital in Oakland. The events were captured on multiple official and private digital video and privately owned cell phone cameras. Owners disseminated their footage to media outlets and to various websites, where it was watched millions of times. Both peaceful and violent protests took place in the days following.|$|E

40|$|Longitudinal {{acceleration}} comfort {{is one of}} {{the essential}} metrics used to evaluate the ride comfort of train. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effectiveness of using hand grip force as a correlate of longitudinal acceleration comfort of <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> <b>trains.</b> In the paper, a motion simulation system was set up and a two-stage experiment was designed to investigate the role of the grip force on the longitudinal comfort of <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> <b>trains.</b> The results of the experiment show that the incremental grip force was linearly correlated with the longitudinal acceleration value, while the incremental grip force had no correlation with the direction of the longitudinal acceleration vector. The results also show that the effects of incremental grip force and acceleration duration on the longitudinal comfort of <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> <b>trains</b> were significant. Based on multiple regression analysis, a step function model was established to predict the longitudinal comfort of <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> <b>trains</b> using the incremental grip force and the acceleration duration. The feasibility and practicably of the model was verified by a field test. Furthermore, a comparative analysis shows that the motion simulation system and the grip force based model were valid to support the laboratory studies on the longitudinal comfort of <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> <b>trains...</b>|$|R

The loops and the ramp were unusable by regular subway cars due to the tight [...] radius of the loops and the steep 6% incline. However, the roadbed {{did not have to be}} lowered, nor was special low profile rail required; even so, the duct banks in the tunnels were replaced.
