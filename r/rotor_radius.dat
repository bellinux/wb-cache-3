40|$|The wake {{characteristics}} of a rotorcraft {{are affected by the}} proximity of a rotor to the ground surface, especially during hover. Ground effect is encountered when the rotor disk is within a distance of a few <b>rotor</b> <b>radii</b> above the ground surface and results in an increase in thrust for a given power relative to that same power condition with the rotor out of ground effect. Although this phenomenon has been highly documented and observed {{since the beginning of the}} helicopter age, there is still a relatively little amount of flow-field data existing to help understand its features. Joint Army and NASA testing was conducted at NASA Langley Research Center using a powered rotorcraft model in hover at various rotor heights and thrust conditions in order to contribute to the complete outwash data set. The measured data included outwash velocities and directions, rotor loads, fuselage loads, and ground pressures. The researchers observed a linear relationship between rotor height and percent download on the fuselage, peak mean outwash velocities occurring at radial stations between 1. 7 and 1. 8 r/R regardless of rotor height, and the measurement azimuthal dependence of the outwash profile for a model incorporating a fuselage.

40|$|A {{relation}} between Cost Of Energy, COE, maximum allowed tip speed, and rated wind speed, is obtained for wind turbines with a given goal rated power. The wind regime is characterised by the corresponding {{parameters of the}} probability density function of wind speed. The non-dimensional characteristics of the rotor: number of blades, the blade radial distributions of local solidity, twist angle, and airfoil type, {{play the role of}} parameters in the mentioned relation. The COE is estimated using a cost model commonly used by the designers. This cost model requires basic design data such as the <b>rotor</b> <b>radius</b> and the ratio between the hub height and the <b>rotor</b> <b>radius.</b> Certain design options, DO, related to the technology of the power plant, tower and blades are also required as inputs.

40|$|A Computational Fluid Dynamics/Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD/CSD) {{coupling}} interface {{was developed}} to obtain aeroelastic solutions of a morphing rotor. The methodology was implemented in Fully Unstructured Navier-Stokes (FUN 3 D) solver, which communicates aerodynamic forces on the blade surface to University of Michigan’s Nonlinear Active Beam Solver (UM/NLABS) and then imports structural deflections of the blade surface during each time step. Development of this methodology adds the capability to model elastic rotors with flexible airfoils. The method was validated through an aerodynamic work analysis, comparison of sectional blade loads and deflections with experimental data, and two-dimensional stability analyses for pitch/plunge flutter and camber flutter. Computational simulations were performed for a rotor in forward flight with the CFD/CSD solver and with a comprehensive CSD solver using finite-state (F-S) aerodynamics, and results were compared. Prescribed three-per-revolution camber deflections were then applied, and solutions of the CFD/CSD and comprehensive CSD computations indicated that three-per-revolution camber actuation {{has the potential to}} minimize hub forces and moments with deflections as small as 0. 25 %c.

However, the thermal stress becomes saturated as the radius is increased to values larger than the critical value.

The volumetric gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient increases with increasing rotational disc speed and decreases with increasing liquid flow rate. This decrease is larger than predicted by the Wallis drift flux model because of the complex two-phase flow pattern. The rate of gas-liquid mass transfer per unit of reactor volume increases with decreasing rotor-stator distance.

40|$|Distributed {{solar thermal}} {{combined}} heat and power {{is an area}} where there is potential for significant innovation to reduce the cost of solar energy. Two areas for innovation were explored: reduced thermal losses in a novel dual-chamber absorber tube and parametric study for optimal efficiency of small-scale (5 - 10 kW) radial inflow turbines. Increasing the peak temperature in solar thermal systems typically increases the cycle thermal efficiency. However, the outer wall temperature of the absorber tube also increases causing greater thermal losses to the surroundings. A novel finned dual-chamber absorber tube design was presented as a possible solution. Fins attached to the outer wall could serve as a heat sink to send heat into the inner chamber. Computation modeling was validated by a reduced-scale experiment to the accuracy of the correlations used. From these models, it has been demonstrated that the heat loss to the environment from the outer wall of the absorber tube could be reduced by 10 - 60 %. The best performance was found when water enters the outer chamber at the highest mass flow rate tested. This impressive improvement encourages further development of the dual chamber design. One of the primary obstacles of scaling down solar thermal technology for distributed power generation is finding an appropriate expander design. The radial inflow turbine was considered. A parametric study of seventeen input parameters was completed. Of these parameters, the mass flow rate, r 2,h r 2,t (ratio of <b>rotor</b> exit hub <b>radius</b> to <b>rotor</b> exit tip <b>radius)</b> and r 2,t r 1 a (ratio of rotor exit tip to <b>rotor</b> inlet <b>radius)</b> had the greatest influence on the thermal efficiency of the system. Decreasing the mass flow rate both increased the turbine efficiency and increased the pressure drop across the turbine both of which enhanced the thermal efficiency. The optimized value of r 2,h r 2,t and r 2,t r 1 a depended on the type of fluid. Wet fluids had an optimal performance with low values of r 2,t r 1 a but high values of r 2,h r 2,t. Dry fluids had an optimal thermal performance with low values of both r 2,h r 2,t and r 2,t r 1 a. Of the fluids studied it appears that dry fluids with low molecular mass and high critical temperature yielded the greatest thermal efficiency. Such fluids typically have low viscosity, allowing there to be less frictional losses in the turbine leading to better thermal efficiencies. Unfortunately, these fluids also share the characteristic of being highly toxic. In order for the radial inflow turbine to scale with reasonable efficiency, a non-toxic dry fluid with low molecular mass and high critical temperature would need to be found...|$|R
