5|$|Lie {{left the}} THHK in 1904, {{although}} he remained active in social work. Despite increasingly poor health, he wrote opinion pieces for the dailies Sin Po and Perniagaan. He also translated extensively. In 1905 Lie published {{the first volume}} of his last Chinese-themed novel, Pembalasan Dendam Hati. This was followed three years later by Kapitein Flamberge, a translation of Paul Saunière's Le Capitaine Belle-Humeur. In the following years he translated several books featuring Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail's fictional adventurer <b>Rocambole,</b> beginning with Kawanan Pendjahat in 1910. Two final translations were published in newspapers and collated as novels after Lie's death: Geneviève de Vadans, from a book entitled De Juffrouw van Gezelschap, and Prampoean jang Terdjoewal, from Hugo Hartmann's Dolores, de Verkochte Vrouw. The former translation was completed by the journalist Lauw Giok Lan.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} literary {{contributions by}} Sergiu Dan are generally small-scale narratives about provincial life, which {{often lead to}} a fiery and unexpected climax. Those fragments published by Contimporanul in the 1920s have been included by researcher Paul Cernat in a special group of [...] "iconoclastic" [...] and absurdist short prose (with those of Dianu, F. Brunea-Fox, Filip Corsa or Sandu Tudor). His experimental prose fragment <b>Rocambole</b> was a parody of Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail's 19th century series (and of literary conventions in general): although only covering half a page, it carried the subtitle [...] "grand adventure novel", and showed its eponymous anti-hero as an incestuous kleptomaniac. The inspiration behind this format, similar to those employed by Dianu and the others, was the avant-garde hero Urmuz. According to Cernat, the Contimporanul writers borrowed Urmuz's manner of toying with the expectations of traditional readers, but were less interested than him in preserving an implicit social message. Cernat illustrates this conclusion with Dan's free verse [...] "diary-poem", published in Issue 71 of Contimporanul, a sample of [...] "cynical libertinism" [...] and [...] "absolute aesthetic freedom": ...|$|E
60|$|His next {{appearance}} {{is at the}} restaurant of one Donadieu, in Bush Street, between Dupont and Kearney, where a copious meal, half a bottle of wine, coffee and brandy may be procured for the sum of four bits, ALIAS fifty cents., 0 pounds, 2s. 2d. sterling. The wine is put down in a whole bottleful, and it is strange and painful to observe the greed with which the gentleman in question seeks to secure the last drop of his allotted half, and the scrupulousness with which he seeks to avoid taking the first drop of the other. This is partly {{explained by the fact}} that if he were to go over the mark - bang would go a tenpence. He is again armed with a book, but his best friends will learn with pain that he seems at this hour to have deserted the more serious studies of the morning. When last observed, he was studying with apparent zest the exploits of one <b>Rocambole</b> by the late Viscomte Ponson du Terrail. This work, originally of prodigious dimensions, he had cut into liths or thicknesses apparently for convenience of carriage.|$|E
6000|$|Her special corner was the parlour--a very genteel room, with Bible prints, a crayon {{portrait}} of Mrs. Corwin in {{the height of}} fashion, a few years ago, another of her son (Mr. Corwin was not represented), a mirror, and a selection of dried grasses. A large book was laid religiously on the table--"From Palace to Hovel," [...] I believe, its name--full of the raciest experiences in England. The author had mingled freely with all classes, the nobility particularly meeting him with open arms; and I must say that traveller had ill requited his reception. His book, in short, was a capital instance of the Penny Messalina school of literature; and there arose from it, in that cool parlour, in that silent, wayside, mountain inn, a rank atmosphere of gold and blood and [...] "Jenkins," [...] and the [...] "Mysteries of London," [...] and sickening, inverted snobbery, fit to knock you down. The mention of this book reminds me of another and far racier picture of our island life. The latter parts of <b>Rocambole</b> are surely too sparingly consulted in the country which they celebrate. No man's education {{can be said to}} be complete, nor can he pronounce the world yet emptied of enjoyment, till he has made the acquaintance of [...] "the Reverend Patterson, director of the Evangelical Society." [...] To follow the evolutions of that reverend gentleman, who goes through scenes in which even Mr. Duffield would hesitate to place a bishop, is to rise to new ideas. But, alas! there was no Patterson about the Toll House. Only, alongside of [...] "From Palace to Hovel," [...] a sixpenny [...] "Ouida" [...] figured. So literature, you see, was not unrepresented.|$|E
