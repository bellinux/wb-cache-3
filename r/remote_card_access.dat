As technology is advancing rapidly, network-cards are becoming cheaper and much faster- 100 Mbits/s Ethernet is common now and in about 1 year 1000 Mbits/s i. e. 1 GigBits Ethernet cards will become a standard. With high-speed network <b>cards,</b> <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> will become as fast as the local disk access which will make diskless nodes a viable alternative to workstations in local LAN. Also diskless nodes eliminate the cost of software upgrades and system administration costs like backup, recovery which will be centralized on the server side. Diskless nodes also enable “sharing/optimization ” of centralized server CPU, memory, hard-disk, tape and CDROM resources. Diskless nodes provides mobility for the users i. e., users can log on from any one of diskless nodes and are not tied to one workstation. In this paper, a SMP-based PC cluster consists of one master node and eight diskless slave nodes (16 processors), is proposed and built. The system architecture and benchmark performances of the cluster are also presented in this paper. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} {{explores the}} possibility of using commonly sourced local materials in the design and installation of a road barrier with Proximity <b>Card</b> <b>Access</b> Control. This study was carried out at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Benin, Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria. The route used is the Engineering Access Road through 500 Lecture Theatre to University of Benin Staff School, which was formerly completely blocked off preventing staff from plying the route to and frotheir offices. Different methods were explored {{such as the use of}} retractable bollards and an operator controlled bollard. However, a rising arm bollard with necessary automatic controls was finally adopted. A screw jack was used to operate the raising arm mechanism because it is simpler but effective, more compact and involved the use of easily procurable components. An automated rising arm barrier with <b>card,</b> <b>remote</b> and call-in <b>access</b> controls was designed and installed on the Engineering access road which became accessible toauthorized staff via the <b>card</b> <b>access</b> control...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Cluster-Aware <b>Remote</b> Disks (<b>CARDs),</b> a Single System I/O architecture for cluster computing. <b>CARDs</b> virtualize <b>accesses</b> to <b>remote</b> cluster disks over a System Area Network. Their {{operation is}} driven by cooperative caching policies that implement a joint management of the cluster caches. All the CARDs of a given disk employ a common policy, independently of other CARD sets. CARD drivers have been implemented as Linux kernel modules which can flexibly accommodate various cooperative caching algorithms. We designed and implemented a decentralized policy called Home-based Serverless Cooperative Caching (HSCC). HSCC showed cache hit ratios over 50 % for workloads that go beyond the limit of the global cache. The best speedup of a <b>CARD</b> over a <b>remote</b> disk interface was 1. 54. ...|$|R
