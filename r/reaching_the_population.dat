40|$|Compliance is important. Better {{adherence}} to treatment regimes leads to lesshealthcare resource utilization overall, as fewer illness recurrence or medicationerrors leading to side-effects take place. Traditionally, {{we have seen}} a conflict between assessments of the efficacy of treatments and the assessment of effectiveness of treatments. Some trials are designed to test the maximal effect of a treatment (that is, efficacy), which others argue is unrealistic and therefore misleading. This group argues for trials based on ‘real-world ’ scenarios (that is, effectiveness). This conflict is natural and inevitable as both objectives are valid, assuming that the trial environment can be replicated in a meaningful way in routine medical care. Furthermore, the conflict can be minimized by accepting that both objectives can be assessed in a competent development plan for a new treatment, answering all critical questions. We have split the issues of compliance and clinical trials into two categories – compliance as a variable in the study to be managed and compliance as the primary endpoint to be studied. Within this discussion, compliance will be defined as the level of {{adherence to}} treatment regimes.

40|$|If Internet economies {{drive the}} growth of service science, then service hyper-networks may {{facilitate}} the understanding of {{the growth of}} Internet economies, such as the convergence of e-commerce and social networking. This new model analyzes the unprecedented promises of a digitally connected world for scaling: up (<b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> <b>population),</b> down (personalization), and transformational (new business designs). It reveals the principle of designing multiple simultaneous layers of connections of persons and organizations on the same basic networks to inflate value propositions (business spaces) and enable massive, simultaneous value cocreations across the life cycles of persons and organizations. This is a new topic in networks science and a new method for service scaling design – e. g., the identification of leaders/hubs (“value worm holes”) to expand business models. We provide a mathematical analysis and an agent-based simulation study to show the effects of inter-relating a person’s multiple roles in his/her life cycle, where each role sparks a particular network. These results confirm that multi-layered networking (e. g., simultaneous multiple social networks) decreases exponentially the degrees of separation between any two nodes in the community (the hyper-network); and thereby increases the possibility for value proposition and cocreation. 1. A BRIEF CASE FOR A NEW SERVICE SCIENCE The Cambridge Papers 2008 by Ifm and IBM [5] consummated the recent industry-led call for a new science of service. Many new studies have responded to this challenge. From the perspective of this paper, we further focus our analysis on a particular defining concept of service that the field generally recognizes: the cocreation of value by the customer and the provider. In other words, we consider any economic activity that cocreates value to be service, or, at the least, to have {{the potential to be a}} service.

40|$|Objective: {{to assess}} {{progression}} of X-ray joint changes {{and their impact}} on functional status of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Subjects and methods. The investigation enrolled 204 patients with early RA included in the RADICAL (Early Arthritis: Diagnosis, Outcomes, Criteria, Active Treatment) program in the period 2003 to 2007. The duration of the disease at the inclusion was less than 2 years. RA was diagnosed according to 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Rheumatoid factor was presentin 67. 5 % of the patients and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies – in 57 %. Women were 86. 5 %; median age was 49 [40; 58] years. The patients received traditional diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs and biological agents (24 %). Therapy response was monitored applying the tight control strategy. Main clinical and laboratory parameters, DAS 28, and HAQ scores, and functional class and hand and foot X-ray were recorded every year. Results and discussion. After 5 years of follow-up, new erosions appeared in 57 % of the patients. Joint erosions were present in 16. 5 % of the patients at the inclusion and in 73 % following 5 years. At baseline, after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5  years, the total erosion scores (modified Sharp score) was equal to 0 [0; 0], 0 [0; 1], 0 [0; 4], 1 [0; 8], 3 [0; 12], 6 [0;  14], respectively. A significant functional improvement could be achieved just {{during the first year of}} follow-up.  Thus, the median HAQ value decreased from 1. 125 [0. 625; 1. 75] to 0. 5 [0. 125; 1. 0], <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> level.  Following 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, the median HAQ was 0. 5 [0; 1. 0], 0. 5 [0; 1. 0], 0. 5 [0; 1. 0], and 0. 75 [0. 125; 1. 125], respectively. There was a weak positive correlation between total erosion scores and HAQ in the eаrly stage of the disease. However, it became more marked after 3, 4, and 5 years (correlation coefficient, 0. 38, 0. 39, and 0. 40, respectively; p < 0. 01).   Conclusion. In spite of the stable pattern of disease course, structural damage progression was seen in patients with early RA. However, detailed erosive component assessment using the modified Sharp score showed that the structural changes were modest in the majority of patients and HAQ value during the first 4 years of follow-up were comparable with the population level, which may be indicative of a rather favorable functional prognosis. Five years later, there was an increasing correlation between total erosion scores and HAQ. This may be responsible for higher HAQ scores after 5 years of follow-up</p...|$|E
