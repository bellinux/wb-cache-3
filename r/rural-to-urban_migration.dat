The authors' main concern is {{with the effects of}} the government migration policy, and {{the focus is on the}} migrations in the city/town/rural hierarchy. There are two main findings. First, although the migration policy resulted in a very low migration level and systematic distortions in migration schedules, its encouragement of downward migrations was very ineffective, whereas its control on <b>rural-to-urban</b> <b>migrations</b> was partially weakened by the strong upward aspiration of rural families awakened by recent economic reform. Consequently, net in-migration contributed substantially to the growth both of city and of town populations. Second, although the level of education had a strong positive effect on the migration propensities both of males and of females in general, it had a strong negative effect on the migration propensities of females at the time of marriage, a finding which suggests that the families at subsistence income level tended to marry their daughters to grooms in other communities in order to reduce the risk of familial income shortfalls. ...|$|R

Firstly, migrants not only differ from stayers but there are also many differences between migrants from and to rural and urban areas. In particular, rural-to-urban migrants are highly educated while those moving from urban to rural areas are not. Secondly, locational preferences vary according to the life-cycle: young and single individuals head to urban areas, whereas couples and retired persons tend to relocate from urban to rural areas. Thirdly, the results suggest that both <b>rural-to-urban</b> and urban-to-rural <b>migration</b> work to the benefit of the urban areas; hence regional disparities are likely to increase rather than decrease upon continuing migration. ...|$|R

40|$|How {{does the}} amount of land youth expect to inherit affect their {{migration}} and employment decisions? This paper explores this question {{in the context of}} rural Ethiopia using panel data from 2010 and 2014. We estimate a household fixed-effects model and exploit exogenous variation in the timing of land redistributions to overcome endogenous household decisions about how much land to bequeath to descendants. We find that larger expected land inheritances significantly lower the likelihood of long-distance permanent migration and of permanent migration to urban areas during this time. Inheriting more land is also associated with a significantly higher likelihood of employment in agriculture and a lower likelihood of employment in the nonagricultural sector. Conversely, the decision to attend school is unaffected. These results appear to be most heavily driven by males and by the older half of our youth sample. We also find several mediating factors matter. Land inheritance plays a much more pronounced role in predicting <b>rural-to-urban</b> permanent <b>migration</b> and nonagricultural-sector employment in areas with less vibrant land markets and in relatively remote areas (those far from major urban centers). Overall, the results suggest that inheritance strongly influences the spatial location and strategic employment decisions of youth.

40|$|Farmland {{abandonment}} {{has important}} impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem recovery, {{as well as}} food security and rural sustainable development. Due to rapid urbanization and industrialization, farmland abandonment has become an increasingly important problem in many countries, particularly in China. To promote sustainable land-use management and environmental sustainability, {{it is important to}} understand the socioeconomic causes and spatial patterns of farmland abandonment. In this study, we explored the dynamic mechanisms of farmland abandonment in Jiangxi province of China using a spatially explicit economical model. The results show that the variables associated with the agricultural products yield are significantly correlated with farmland abandonment. The increasing opportunity cost of farming labor is the main factor in farmland abandonment in conjunction with a rural labor shortage due to <b>rural-to-urban</b> population <b>migration</b> and regional industrialization. Farmlands are more likely to be abandoned in areas located far from the villages and towns due to higher transportation costs. Additionally, farmers with more land but lower net income are more likely to abandon poor-quality farmland. Our results support the hypothesis that farmland abandonment takes place in locations in which the costs of cultivation are high and the potential crop yield is low. In addition, our study also demonstrates that a spatially explicit economic model is necessary to distinguish between the main driving forces of farmland abandonment. Policy implications are also provided for potential future policy decisions...|$|R

The primary objective of this doctoral dissertation research project is to obtain {{a better understanding of how}} this large-scale circular labor migration movement impacts the rural environment through sociocultural and economic mediating factors. Major intervening variables identified in recent literature on environmental effects of migration revolve around rural livelihoods and community development. A comprehensive conceptual framework was developed in this study that incorporated the rural livelihoods approach and the interactional theory of community development into analyzing environmental consequences of rural migration. The core assumption was that household livelihoods and community interactional capacity were critical intervening variables between rural out-migration and its subsequent environmental outcomes in rural origin areas. The analysis drew on empirical data collected from four rural villages in Chongqing Municipality, where the <b>rural-to-urban</b> labor <b>migration</b> rate is currently the highest in China. This study used a mixed-methods approach in data collection and analysis. Secondary socioeconomic and biophysical data provided contextual information for the study area and guided the selection of study communities. In-depth key informant interviews gathered detailed information about rural livelihoods and community interaction experiences in study communities for the development of survey instrument, and provided a contextualized backdrop for the analysis of survey data. The household survey was conducted using a face-to-face questionnaire interview technique to collect data on household livelihood activities and community participation for statistical analysis. Results confirm the research hypothesis that labor-migrant and non-labor-migrant households are significantly different in livelihood activities including agricultural practices, income and consumption, and resource use and management. Labor-migrant households differed particularly from those non-labor-migrant households whose members were all mainly engaged in agricultural production, while sharing many similar livelihood characteristics with those which had member(s) holding regular local off-farm work. In addition, this research found that the relationship between rural labor out-migration and community interaction varied across study communities. Findings suggest rural migration presents both detrimental and beneficial potentialities for community development in rural origin areas. Labor migration constrains the participation level of migrants and migrant households for community activities, at the same time that it creates possibilities for constructing a rural community field extending beyond local boundaries. Altogether, these findings have implications for the subsequent environmental outcomes of rural labor out-migration and corresponding natural resource management and policy in rural origin areas...|$|R
