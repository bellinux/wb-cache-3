Two warning units were built and housed in a cabinet at the track side of the quay spur at the throat of Weymouth yard. This equipment comprised a yellow box which fitted on a bracket just above the <b>rubbing</b> <b>plate</b> on the cab front. It had an amber rotating beacon and bell which served to warn thoroughfare users and was controlled from the driving cab. Each member of Class 33/1 and all TC stock had a small socket where the bell/beacon units plugged in to draw power from the train systems. Later units (i.e. those in use after the tramway fell out of general use and the power sockets had been removed during overhaul) were smaller and mounted on a lamp bracket just below the cab window. These had an on/off switch {{on the bottom of}} the unit and no bell - warnings being given using the train horn.|$|E
50|$|To {{simplify the}} {{marshalling}} of trains and reduce their overall length, the original four-wheeled stock was close coupled in pairs from 1887 onwards. This involved removing the chopper couplers {{from one end of}} each vehicle and replacing them with conventional side buffers on one carriage and <b>rubbing</b> <b>plates</b> on the other. A link and pin coupling then joined the inner ends of the carriages whilst conventional chopper couplings were retained on the outer ends of the each pair.|$|R

5000|$|The {{process by}} which the master plane gages were {{produced}} dates back to antiquity but was refined to an unprecedented degree in the Maudslay shop. The process begins with three square plates each given an identification (ex., 1,2 and 3). The first step is to <b>rub</b> <b>plates</b> 1 and 2 together with a marking medium (called bluing today) revealing the high spots which would be removed by hand scraping with a steel scraper, until no irregularities were visible. This would not produce true plane surfaces but a [...] "ball and socket" [...] concave-concave and convex-convex fit, as this mechanical fit, like two perfect planes, can slide over each other and reveal no high spots. The rubbing and marking are repeated after rotating 2 relative to 1 by 90 degrees to eliminate concave-convex [...] "potato-chip" [...] curvature. Next, plate number 3 ia (the process is still in use) compared and scraped to conform to plate number 1 in the same two trials. In this manner plates number 2 and 3 would be identical. Next plates number 2 and 3 would be checked against each other to determine what condition existed, either both plates were [...] "balls" [...] or [...] "sockets" [...] or [...] "chips" [...] or a combination. These would then be scraped until no high spots existed and then compared to plate number 1. After repeating this process, comparing and scraping the three plates together, they would subsequently to the labor generate exact true plane surfaces accurate to within millionths of an inch. which is the thickness of the marking medium.|$|R

We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of a periodic stripe pattern consisting of alternate domains of uniaxial and biaxial smectic-A phases when a binary mixture made of rod-like and bent-core molecules is taken between <b>rubbed</b> glass <b>plates.</b> The same mixture usually exhibits only the biaxial smectic-A phase with a uniform concentration when the <b>plates</b> are not <b>rubbed.</b> The apolar director nb corresponding to the bow axes of the bent-core molecules aligns along the rubbing direction in the stripes with the wave vector of the pattern making a finite angle ω 0 with nb. The novel stripe pattern is extremely soft, as evidenced by the occurrence of isolated lattice disclinations, whose nature is dictated by ω 0. We argue that the stripes owe their origin to the underlying spatial modulation of surface charges generated on the glass <b>plates</b> by the <b>rubbing</b> action.

The liquid crystal is placed in a wedge shaped space formed by the plate to be studied and a « standard » plate giving a strong homeotropic anchoring. Instead of using a total reflection technique, we measure the optical path difference (Δl) between the ordinary and extraordinary waves, {{as a function of}} the sample thickness (d). From an analysis of this variation, we obtain the pretilt angle from the region of large thickness, and the anchoring energy from the region of small thickness, a domain which could not be studied with the previous technique.

40|$|In {{this work}} we show, {{by means of}} {{confocal}} photoluminescence measurements and fspump-probe spectroscopy, that a large polarized stimulated emission from polyfluoreneketo defects is obtained {{in a mixture of}} polyfluorene with a nematic low molecularweight Liquid Crystal (LC).

In this blend a peculiar phase separation generates an ordered networkof LC-rich micro-domains with the most of the polyfluorene chains placed on the microdomainsboundaries. These well-defined phase boundaries have an anchoring effectso strong that the polymeric chains are forced to align parallel to them, despite thealignment of the nematic LC induced by the rubbing layers. The isolation andorientation of the polymeric chains reveal the possibility to obtain polarized optical gainfrom the keto defect. The results are expected to have broad implications in the fieldsof photophysics and material design of polyfluorene materials, since the fomation offew fluorenone units can be seen not anymore as a form of degradation of thepolyfluorene but as an improvement of the physical properties of this interestingpolymer. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R

5000|$|A {{diamond plate}} is a steel plate, {{sometimes}} {{mounted on a}} plastic or resin base, coated with diamond grit, an abrasive that will grind metal. When they are mounted they are sometimes known as diamond stones. [...] The plate may {{have a series of}} holes cut in it that capture the swarf cast off as grinding takes place, and cuts costs by reducing the amount of abrasive surface area on each plate. Diamond plates can serve many purposes including sharpening steel tools, and for maintaining the flatness of man-made waterstones, which can become grooved or hollowed in use. Truing (flattening a stone whose shape has been changed as it wears away) is widely considered essential to the sharpening process but some hand sharpening techniques utilise the high points of a non-true stone. As the only part of a diamond plate to wear away is a very thin coating of grit and adhesive, and in a good diamond plate this wear is minimal due to diamond's hardness, a diamond plate retains its flatness. <b>Rubbing</b> the diamond <b>plate</b> on a whetstone to true (flatten) the whetstone is a modern alternative to more traditional truing methods.|$|R
5000|$|Now {{consider}} {{what happens if}} the external force on the ball drags it across the plate. In this case, the force on the ball can be decomposed into two component forces: one normal to the plate's surface, pressing it in, and the other tangential, dragging it along. As the tangential component is increased, the ball will start to slide along the plate. At the same time, the normal force will deform both objects, just as with the static situation. If the normal force is low, the ball will <b>rub</b> against the <b>plate</b> but not permanently alter its surface. The rubbing action will create friction and heat, but it will not leave a mark on the plate. However, as the normal force increases, eventually the stresses in the plate's surface will exceed its yield strength. When this happens the ball will plow through the surface and create a trough behind it. The plowing action of the ball is burnishing. Burnishing also occurs when the ball can rotate, as would happen in the above scenario if another flat plate was brought down from above to induce downwards loading, {{and at the same time}} to cause rotation and translation of the ball, or in the case of a ball bearing ...|$|R

We report {{measurements}} of birefringence (Δ n) of several nematic liquid crystals having transverse {{as well as}} longitudinal dipole moments in thin (1. 4 to 2. 3 μm) and thick (7 to 16 μm) cells. <b>Rubbed</b> polyimide-coated glass <b>plates</b> are used to get planar alignment of the nematic director in these cells. We find significant enhancement (6 to 18 %) of Δ n (∝ S, where S is the orientational order parameter) in thin cells in all compounds with aromatic cores even at temperatures far (∼ 20 ^∘ C) below the nematic-isotropic transition point. The enhancement is larger in compounds having several phenyl rings and lower {{if the number of}} phenyl rings is reduced. In a compound that does not have an aromatic core no significant enhancement is observed, implying that the strength of the surface potential depends on the aromaticity of the cores. Assuming a perfect orientational order at the surface, calculations based on the Landau-de Gennes theory show that the thickness averaged enhancement of S is sharply reduced as the temperature is lowered in the nematic phase. The measured order parameter S is further enhanced in thin cells because of the stiffening of the elastic constant which reduces the thermal fluctuations of the nematic director. The combined effect is however too small at low temperatures to account for the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|A custom tribometer was {{developed}} to investigate the production of nano-scale films from the anti-wear additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP). The tribometer was designed to operate in various conditions of lubrication severity, from boundary to hydrodynamic lubrication regimes. A cylinder-on-plate layout, in which a cylinder rotates and <b>rubs</b> against a <b>plate</b> in a line contact, was employed for this purpose. ZDDP, a wear preventative additive universally used in engine and gear oil formulations, was studied in detail with respect to tribofilm production. As typical oil formulations contain an assortment of additives, {{the development of these}} films in the presence of other additives was studied. Of these, overbased detergents have recently been under scrutiny with mixed findings of synergetic and antagonistic effects. This project investigates the effects of overbased calcium sulfonate, a basic detergent used to neutralize acids and solubilize contaminants in oil, using electrical contact resistance (ECR), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and 31 -phosphorous nuclear magnetic resonance (P₃₁NMR). Oil blends of 2. 4 % (mass) ZDDP with varying concentrations of calcium sulfonate were mixed for rubbing and heating tests. ECR was used to monitor the development of the tribofilm in-situ of the tribometer and AES was used in postmortem analysis to measure the film thickness. Analysis with P₃₁ NMR was employed for a series of heating experiments to characterize the chemical interactions between the two additives. Tests in light boundary lubrication show a trend of suppression of ZDDP tribofilm formation with the introduction of the detergent. by H. Arthur Kariya. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|My art {{speaks of}} process and patterns, forces and textures. Having lived the {{majority}} of my life amid the visually rich geology of the Southwest, {{as well as in the}} seismic and volcanically active regions of California and Hawaii, I have been reminded almost daily through the shakings and rumblings of the lithosphere that we sit upon continental and oceanic plates that are in constant motion. Magma surges upward from the molten core; the great plates grind past adjacent land masses or heave themselves over and onto plates that interrupt their migration or duck beneath another plate, and are recycled by the molten interior. The medium of printmaking allows me to express the processes that have created the lithosphere we see: pressure and plates, power and fragility, substrata and surface, creation and destruction, vapors and solids, process and result, patterns and textures. The paper upon which I print can be likened to the lithosphere which must fold and crinkle in response to the underlying events. The metal and cardboard plates which I have etched and created are like the continental and oceanic plates. Their pressures and movements help determine the appearance of the lithosphere. Deposited upon these plates are the colored sands eroded from the rocks and from the magma which, when exposed to the atmosphere, oxidizes. The inks used in printing are ground from this very same stuff offered up by the interior. <b>Plates</b> <b>rubbed</b> and rolled with these pigments plus paper are then sent through the press. Under great pressure, the paper takes on textures and colors. The molten interior has also sent up precious metals. These metals begin their upward journey in a vaporous state. As they travel through the fissures and fractures of the lithosphere, they solidify and are later exposed to view through the forces of erosion. They add sparkle and luster to the lithosphere. Perched precariously on the outermost fringe of the lithosphere is the human race, whose rational intellect has led to the invention of tools that can read and measure the rumblings and shakings of the great plates. The hard, straight lines registered on the seismograph seem to produce a net which just might control and hold back the seismic activity and plate tectonics which tend to disrupt human activity. In the fourteen works of "Seismic Rumblings," I hoped to create a sensual and physical experience of the unseen and yet felt forces. In the end, humans can only stand in awe and respect at the beauty and power created from what is seen as destructive forces. The results of these forces attract the eye and engage the imagination...|$|R
