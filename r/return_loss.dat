25|$|Many {{electrical}} properties of networks of components (inductors, capacitors, resistors) may be expressed using S-parameters, such as gain, <b>return</b> <b>loss,</b> voltage {{standing wave ratio}} (VSWR), reflection coefficient and amplifier stability. The term 'scattering' is more common to optical engineering than RF engineering, referring to the effect observed when a plane electromagnetic wave is incident on an obstruction or passes across dissimilar dielectric media. In the context of S-parameters, scattering refers {{to the way in}} which the traveling currents and voltages in a transmission line are affected when they meet a discontinuity caused by the insertion of a network into the transmission line. This is equivalent to the wave meeting an impedance differing from the line's characteristic impedance.|$|E
25|$|VNAs {{designed}} for the simultaneous measurement of the S-parameters of networks with more than two ports are feasible but quickly become prohibitively complex and expensive. Usually their purchase is not justified since the required measurements can be obtained using a standard 2-port calibrated VNA with extra measurements followed by the correct interpretation of the results obtained. The required S-parameter matrix can be assembled from successive two port measurements in stages, two ports at a time, on each occasion with the unused ports being terminated in high quality loads equal to the system impedance. One risk {{of this approach is}} that the <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> or VSWR of the loads themselves must be suitably specified to be {{as close as possible to}} a perfect 50 Ohms, or whatever the nominal system impedance is. For a network with many ports there may be a temptation, on grounds of cost, to inadequately specify the VSWRs of the loads. Some analysis will be necessary to determine what the worst acceptable VSWR of the loads will be.|$|E

500|$|One {{measure of}} cable {{manufacturing}} and installation quality is how closely the characteristic impedance adheres to the nominal impedance along its length. [...] Impedance {{changes can be}} caused by variations in geometry along the cable length. [...] In turn, these {{can be caused by}} a faulty manufacturing process or by faulty installation (such as not observing limits on bend radii). [...] Unfortunately, there is no easy, non-destructive method of directly measuring impedance along a cable's length. [...] It can, however, be indicated indirectly by measuring reflections, that is, <b>return</b> <b>loss.</b> [...] <b>Return</b> <b>loss</b> by itself does not reveal much, since the cable design will have some intrinsic <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> anyway due to not having a purely resistive characteristic impedance. [...] The technique used is to carefully adjust the cable termination to obtain as close a match as possible and then to measure the variation of <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> with frequency. [...] The minimum <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> so measured is called the structural <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> (SRL). [...] SRL is a measure of a cables' adherence to its nominal impedance {{but it is not a}} direct correspondence, errors further from the generator have less effect on SRL than those close to it. [...] The measurement must also be carried out at all in-band frequencies to be significant. [...] The reason for this is that equally spaced errors introduced by the manufacturing process will cancel and be invisible, or at least much reduced, at certain frequencies due to quarter wave impedance transformer action.|$|E
