50|$|The <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> are not {{sharpened}} in {{the same}} way as a conventional mower blade. They are usually quite dull so they whack through dense plant growth, whereas a sharp blade often gets stuck or slowed down. The blades are very heavy, up to an inch thick, so the centrifugal force pulling out is stronger than the forces of the vegetation bouncing in. They are made of heat treated high carbon steel that can withstand strikes with hard objects such as rocks and stones.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{explore the}} soil {{workability}} of <b>rotary</b> <b>blade</b> suitable for large tilling depth (over 20 cm) manufactured through boronizing treatment, this work {{focuses on the}} corrosion behavior of 65 Mn steel after boronizing treatment in two acid mediums, i. e. the strong acidic medium that hydrochloric solution and the weak acidic that fertilizer-containing soil, and the comparison with existing technology of general <b>rotary</b> <b>blade</b> (lonnealing after overall quenching). The result shows that the corrosion resistance in the two acid mediums of 65 Mn steel after boronizing treatment is remarkably improved. After 168 hours’ corrosion in the hydrochloric acid solution, the weight loss of boronizing-status sample is only 27. 9 % of that of lonnealing-status sample. Moreover, there is no obvious weight loss in boronizing-status sample after 168 hours’ corrosion in the fertilizer-containing soil, while the weight of lonnealing-status sample is lighter than the original weight after about 150 hours’ corrosion. The improvement of the corrosion resistance lies in the significant reduction of the anodization speed in strong acid medium and the effective prevention of phosphorization reaction in weak acidic medium...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Small {{agricultural}} machinery with forward and reverse-rotational <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> was proposed for {{solving the problem}} of cultivation with compacted soil. Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) based models of forward and reverse-rotational <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> were carried out using the LS-DYNA software. SPH is a mesh free method, thus large material distortions {{that occur in the}} soil cutting problem are easily managed. In most earth moving machinery, such as bulldozers or tillage tools, the working tool is a blade. Hence for tillage systems, accurately predicting the forces acting on the blade is of prime importance in helping to enhance productivity. Structural parameters of reverse-rotational rotary blade were studied and optimized with orthogonal test and numerical simulating technology. Results show that forward and reverse-rotational rotary tool can independently work for the cutting of compacted soil with different operating resistance. It is perfectly feasible to apply the proposed composite rotary tiller to compacted soil deep-tilling with low power motor. Proper structural parameters of forward and reverse-rotational <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> can reduce the power consumption. This method provides theoretical basis for the design of tools...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Power {{lawnmowers}} {{can pose}} significant {{danger of injury}} to both the operator and the bystander, from {{direct contact with the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> or missile injury. Our objective was to review our experience with paediatric lawnmower-associated trauma, and the safety recommendations available to operators of power lawnmowers. METHODS: The patient cohort comprised paediatric (< 16 years of age) patients treated for lawnmower-associated trauma, by the plastic surgery service, between 1996 and 2003. These patients were identified retrospectively. Age at the time of injury, location and extent of bony and soft tissue injuries sustained, treatment instituted and clinical outcome were recorded. Brochures and instruction manuals of six lawnmower manufacturers were reviewed, and safety recommendations noted. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were identified. The majority of injuries occurred from direct contact with the <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> (93 %); the remaining child sustained a burn injury. Fourteen children (93 %) required operative intervention. Seven patients (46 %) sustained injuries resulting in amputation, two of whom had major limb amputations. All children, except the burns patient, underwent wound debridement and received antibiotic therapy. Reconstructive methods ranged from primary closure to free tissue transfer. Many patients required multiple procedures. In all instruction manuals, instructions to keep children and pets indoors or out of the yard when mowing were found. CONCLUSIONS: Lawnmower injuries can be devastating, particularly in children. Many victims have lasting deformities {{as a result of their}} injuries. Awareness of and stringent adherence to safety precautions during use of power lawnmowers can prevent many of these accidents...|$|E

Proper rotation in these kinds of composting machines is an efficient technique which produces uniform end product due to good agitation, aeration and mixing of the compost (Rich and Bharti 2015). The composter was able to handle 200  kg of waste at maximum. It was equipped with three <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> for mixing of materials and an air blower to maintain enough oxygen levels inside the chamber. Away from ambient temperatures which were 30 and 23  °C on average for day time and night time, respectively, the temperature inside the composter was automatically controlled at 56  ±  4  °C using heating functions and sensors equipped in the composter. The temperature inside the composter changed mainly due to heat generation as a result of degradation of organic matters by microorganisms and because of ambient air blown inside the composter for aeration purposes (Arslan Topal et al. 2016). Greatest thermophilic activity would be observed during composting process when the temperature ranges between 52 and 60  °C (Kalamdhad and Kazmi 2009; Mohee and Mudhoo 2005).|$|E

40|$|Pulse {{crops in}} Bangladesh are mainly low-input rainfed crops with {{broadcast}} sowing. Since the 1990 s, rotary tillage two-wheel tractors (2 WT) have largely replaced animal draft for crop establishment. However, rotary tillage causes excessive evaporation from seedbeds in rapidly-drying soils. Therefore 2 WT-based minimum tillage (MT) options were explored to optimize seedbed moisture for lentil and chickpea establishment. Two types of 2 WT-mounted seeding units were manufactured, a strip tiller retaining <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> only {{in front of}} the tynes and a tyne seeder in which the rotary tiller shaft is removed. In some soil types, seedling emergence and grain yields of lentil and chickpea with these seeders matched those with broadcasting. In wet soils, the minimal soil disturbance with MT resulted in anaerobic conditions around seedling roots thereby limiting root growth and nodulation. In clay soils with rapid surface drying traction was inadequate for tyne tillage and strip tillage could not adequately penetrate rice paddy hardpans to allow adequate growth of seedling roots. Potential solutions to these limitations are under test so that 2 WT-based MT can be adapted for more timely and economic sowing of crops, including pulses, in smallholder plots and to achieve the agronomic benefits of line sowing over broadcast sowing...|$|E
40|$|The {{rotary tiller}} slot planter {{of the present}} {{invention}} comprises a subsoiler shank positioned to engage the soil and make a trench therein. A pair of rotary tiller blades are rotatably mounted on the opposite sides of the sub-soil shank in planes parallel thereto. The center-lines of the rotary tiller wheels are located behind the subsoil shank. Each of the wheels have a plurality of blades extending radially outwardly from the rotational axis thereof and terminating in outer radial ends which engage the soil slightly ahead of the subsoiler shank and adjacent the lateral edges of the trench. A seed tube shank is positioned behind the subsoiler shank and between the tiller wheels. The seed tube shank has a lower end positioned to extend below the soil surface. A seed tube is positioned behind the seed tube shank for depositing seed in the soil. The rotation of the blades {{on opposite sides of the}} subsoil shank causes the soil to be mechanically aggregated and aerated and helps prepare a seed bed for the seeds.
