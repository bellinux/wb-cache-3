40|$|The {{estimation}} of the fractal dimension of a natural surface using spectral analysis of amplitude SAR data is {{a powerful tool for}} geophysical applications. However, the obtained estimates are influenced by the presence of speckle. In this paper we present first results regarding the analysis of the effects on fractal dimension maps due to the application of despeckling techniques on SAR images. The use of simulated data allows to obtain also <b>multilook</b> <b>images,</b> presenting a very high number of looks, which should represent a virtually speckle-free image. In the results section different despeckling techniques are considered, relaying on both classical spatial filtering and non-local means.

40|$|In {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) images, moving objects appear defocused or at wrong positions, depending on the direction of their motion.

40|$|Multilook {{processing}} is {{a widely}} used speckle reduction approach in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. Conventionally, it is achieved by incoherently summing of some independent low-resolution images formulated from overlapping subbands of the SAR signal. However, {{in the context of}} compressive sensing (CS) SAR imaging, where the samples are collected at sub-Nyquist rate, the data spectrum is highly aliased that hinders the direct application of the existing multilook techniques. In this letter, we propose a new CS-SAR imaging method that can realize multilook processing simultaneously during image reconstruction. The main idea is to replace the SAR observation matrix by the inverse of multilook procedures, which is then combined with random sampling matrix to yield a multilook CS-SAR observation model. Then a joint sparse regularization model, considering pixel dependency of subimages, is derived to form <b>multilook</b> <b>images.</b> The suggested SAR imaging method can not only reconstruct sparse scene efficiently below Nyquist rate, but is also able to achieve a comparable reduction of speckles during reconstruction. Simulation results are finally provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comment: Will be submitted to GRS lette...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{filtering}} {{to reduce}} noise {{is an important}} process to improve phase measurements in interferometric imaging. Currently these techniques are predominately based on filtering the interferometric phase. However the amplitude, which is ignored or only used to a minimal extent in conventional filtering, holds useful information {{about the nature of}} the phase measurement. When combining <b>multilook</b> <b>images,</b> adding the full complex vectors produces a least mean square estimate of the interferometric phase. Utilising this principle, a new spatial filtering technique is introduced. In this technique, a compromise is suggested where the square-root of the interferometric amplitude is taken prior to summing the spatially weighted vectors. To deduce the weights for the filtering function it was necessary to utilise a Monte-Carlo approach, which calculates the filter weights via an iterative minimisation procedure. The main application for this filter is to improve the quality of displacement maps obtained by a ground based interferometric radar system that monitors rock slope movement in a mining environment. For this application high SNR is expected, however, due to speckle, large errors can still be present in the image. The filter is designed to reduce these errors. Using simulated data and C-Band ERS images, the new spatial vector filter is shown to produce improved phase measurements compared with conventional filtering techniques...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{methods for}} {{statistical analysis of}} the probability distributions used to model <b>multilook</b> polarimetric <b>radar</b> <b>images.</b> The methods {{are based on a}} matrix-variate version of Mellin's integral transform. The proposed theoretical framework is referred to as Mellin kind statistics. It is an extension of a theory recently developed for single polarisation amplitude and intensity data to the complex matrix-variate case describing <b>multilook</b> polarimetric <b>images.</b> This generalisation is made possible by the rediscovery of a generalised Mellin transform, which is defined for functions of positive definite Hermitian matrices. The domain makes it suited for application to the distributions used to model the polarimetric covariance and coherency matrix. The analysis tools include the matrix-variate Mellin kind characteristic function, which is defined with the Mellin transform in place of the conventional Fourier transform. Matrix log-moments and matrix log-cumulants are retrieved from this function. The matrix log-cumulants are used in a moment based approach to parameter estimation of the distribution parameters. The estimators make efficient use of all the statistical information in the polarimetric covariance matrix, and are superior to all known alternatives. The matrix log-cumulants are also used to construct the first known goodness-of-fit test for matrix distributions based on the multilook polarimetric product model. The algorithms are interpreted by means of a highly informative graphical visualisation tool displaying a space spanned by certain matrix log-cumulants. It is demonstrated that the matrix-variate Mellin transform is the natural tool for analysing <b>multilook</b> polarimetric <b>radar</b> <b>images.</b> This conclusion is based on the simple and elegant mathematical expressions obtained, the superb statistical properties of developed estimators, as well as the intuitive interpretations offered by the Mellin kind statistics...|$|R

We implement and compare several techniques which vary in complexity. Among the simple methods that are implemented are differencing, Euclidean distance, and image ratioing. These methods require minimal processing time, with little computational complexity, and incorporate no statistical information. We also implemented methods which incorporate second order statistic calculations in making a change decision in efforts to mitigate false alarms arising from the speckle noise, misregistration errors, and nonlinear variations in SAR images.

The model is based on the three-parameters gener- alized-	(GK) probability density function (pdf).

This speckle model embodies Rayleigh,	, and Rice scattering scenes which are typical of marine scenes. The use of the three parameters, related to the GK pdf ones, is able to highlight the presence of both low backscat- tering areas and areas in which a small dominant scatterer is present.

For DInSAR technique, the generally used SRTM and relief-DEM, which {{was derived from}} aerial topographic map, were {{used to evaluate the}} influence of external DEM. The results show that SRTM could not fully compensate the complex topography of the research area. The corner reflectors installed during the acquisition of SAR dataset were used to estimate the accuracy of geocoding. The terrain corrected geocoding results based on relief-DEM were much better than using SRTM, with the root mean square error (RMSE) being 6. 35 m in X direction and 11. 65 m in Y direction (both in UTM projection), around one pixel of the <b>multilooked</b> intensity <b>image</b> to be geocoded. For PSI technique, the results from time-series analysis of multi-baseline differential interferograms were integrated to restrict only persistent scatterer candidates near the boundary of subsiding area for regression analysis.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an improved Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) ship detection algorithm in spaceborne {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) image based on Alphastable distribution model. Typically, the CFAR algorithm uses the Gaussian distribution model to describe statistical characteristics of a SAR image background clutter. However, the Gaussian distribution is only valid for <b>multilook</b> SAR <b>images</b> when several radar looks are averaged. As sea clutter in SAR images shows spiky or heavy-tailed characteristics, the Gaussian distribution often fails to describe background sea clutter. In this study, we replace the Gaussian distribution with the Alpha-stable distribution, which is widely used in impulsive or spiky signal processing, to describe the background sea clutter in SAR images. In our proposed algorithm, an initial step for detecting possible ship targets is employed. Then, similar to the typical two-parameter CFAR algorithm, a local process {{is applied to the}} pixel identified as possible target. A RADARSAT- 1 image is used to validate this Alpha-stable distribution based algorithm.

40|$|Abstract—The {{advent of}} polarimetric {{synthetic}} aperture radar has spurred a growing interest in statistical models for complex-valued covariance matrices, which is the common representation of <b>multilook</b> polarimetric <b>radar</b> <b>images.</b> In this paper, we respond to an emergent need by proposing statistical tests for the sim-ple and composite goodness-of-fit (GoF) problem for a class of compound matrix distributions. The tests are based on Mellin-kind matrix cumulants.

TGRS- 2012 - 00518. R 1 1 Abstract—Objective performance assessment is a key enabling factor {{for the development of}} better and better image processing algorithms. In SAR despeckling, however, the lack of speckle-free images precludes the use of reliable full-reference measures, leaving the comparison among competing techniques on shaky bases. In this work we propose a new framework for the objective (quantitative) assessment of SAR despeckling techniques, based on simulation of SAR images relevant to canonical scenes. Each image is generated using a complete SAR simulator that includes proper physical models for the sensed surface, the scattering, and the radar operational mode. Therefore, in the limits of the simulation models, the employed simulation procedure generates reliable and meaningful SAR images with controllable parameters. By simulating multiple SAR images as different instances relevant to the same scene we can therefore obtain, a “true ” <b>multilook</b> full-resolution SAR <b>image,</b> with an arbitrary number of looks, thus generating (by definition) the closest object to a clean reference image. Based on this concept, we build a full performance assessment framework by choosing a suitable set of canonical scenes and corresponding objective measures on the SAR images that account for speckl...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} an unsupervised method capable to provide estimates of temporal coherence starting {{from a couple}} of <b>multilook</b> detected SAR <b>images</b> of the same scene. The method relies on a robust measurement of the temporal correlation of speckle patterns occurring between the two pass dates. Thanks to the accurate speckle assessment, the temporal correlation coefficient (TCC) of speckle between two overlapped images taken different times is estimated. A nonlinear transformation aimed at decorrelating the data across time while retaining the multiplicative noise model is defined starting from the pixel geometric mean and ratio of the two overlapped observations. Such a reversible transformation is is applied to the couple of images to expedite assessment of temporal speckle patterns correlation. The TCC of speckles is estimated from the noise variances of a transformed couple of images by inverting the relationship yielding the noise variances of the transformed data. Experiments are carried out on two SAR observations from the ERS- 1 / 2 Tandem mission. Starting from the SLC pair, coherence is first estimated to be used as reference. Then, detected 5 -looks images are produced and TCC is measured on square blocks, to yield the desired coherence estimate. A linear regression fit shows a good degree of matching with the true coherence values, which holds also on textured areas. Experiments show a good degree of accuracy, when the TCC of speckles is estimated on 32 × 32 blocks of the geometric mean and ratio of detected 5 -looks amplitude images. The method yields acceptable results also in the presence of strong reflectors and textures (urban area) where intensity-based coherence estimators generally fail...|$|R

The configuration and parameterization of the instrument is highly flexible enabling StripMap, ScanSAR and SpotLight imaging modes in various polarizations {{in a wide range}} of different antenna beams. A special dual receive antenna mode will even provide the possibility for along track interferometry. The mission will be conducted by the German Aerospace Center DLR. The principle tasks of the ground segment are satellite commanding, SAR data reception and archiving, SAR data processing and distribution. The main item of the payload related part of the ground segment will be the new TerraSAR-X multi-mode SAR processor TMSP which adequately fits to the TerraSAR-X instruments flexibility. The TMSP design and selection of algorithms are mainly driven by the requirements, that all SAR raw data will be systematically analyzed, archived and focused in order to obtain medium resolution browse images for cataloguing.

These properties can be used to discriminate types of land use and to develop specialized filters for speckle noise reduction, among other applications. Parameter estimation is useful, for example, in image filtering, segmentation and classification. 0 In this work we assume the G A distribution as the Universal Model for <b>multilook</b> amplitude SAR <b>images</b> under the Multiplicative Model. We studied some important properties of this distribution and some classical estimators for its parameters. It can be seen that Maximum Likelihood and Moment estimators can be highly influenced by small percentages of ‘outliers’, i. e., observations that do not fully obey the basic assumptions. These outliers appear mainly because the hypothesis of independence and equal distribution of observations are seldom satisfied in practice. For instance, in the process of filtering some processed pixels within a window, they could come from regions with different underlying distributions. In this case, classical filters will exhibit a sub optimal performance, blurring edges for instance. Hence, it is important to find Robust Estimators. One of the best known classes of robust techniques is that of M estimators, which are an extension of the Maximum Likelihood estimation method. In this work we compute the M estimators for the parameters of the G distribution and compare them with classical estimators with a Monte Carlo experience. 0 A RESUMEN El conocimiento de las propiedades estadísticas de los datos SAR juega un rol preponderante en la interpretación y procesamiento de imágenes.
