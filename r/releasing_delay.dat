40|$|At fast {{chemical}} synapses {{the rapid}} release of neurotransmitter that occurs {{within a few}} milliseconds of an action potential {{is followed by a}} more sustained elevation of release probability, known as <b>delayed</b> <b>release.</b> Here we characterize the role of calcium in <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> and test the hypothesis that facili-tation and <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> share a common mechanism. Syn-apses between cerebellar granule cells and their postsynaptic targets, stellate cells and Purkinje cells, were studied in rat brain slices. Presynaptic calcium transients were measured with calcium-sensitive fluorophores, and <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> was de-tected with whole-cell recordings. Calcium influx, presynaptic calcium dynamics, and the number of stimulus pulses were altered to assess their effect on <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> and facilitation.

50|$|Most {{commonly}} {{it refers}} to time dependent release in oral dose formulations. Timed release has several distinct variants such assustained release where prolonged release is intended, pulse <b>release,</b> <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> (e.g. to target {{different regions of the}} GI tract) etc. A distinction of controlled release is that not only prolongs action but it attempts to maintain drug levels within the therapeutic window to avoid potentially hazardous peaks in drug concentration following ingestion or injection and to maximize therapeutic efficiency.|$|R

40|$|The {{recent decades}} have {{witnessed}} enormous development in communication world; especially in internet technology that has {{played an important}} role in moving forward the human communications, with such development user demands better communication services such as video conferencing. Video conferencing becomes more popular nowadays since it can break the constraints on the communication ways of people who are probably exist in diverse geographical locations in real time. SIP is preferred to be used as signaling protocol for video conferencing, but still using SIP for video conferencing is affected by the delay which reduces the satisfaction of user as it decreases the QoS. This thesis work is aimed to study the performance of SIP signaling for video conferencing, and also describing the causes of the delay in SIP session establishment and termination. The literature review and the two simulations have been carried out in this thesis to examine the effect of specific parameters on the session setup delay. The first study is carried out by using ns- 2 to simulate different transport protocols and study their effect on session setup delay. The second study is carried out by using SIPp to achieve two objects. The first object is to study the relationship between number of simultaneous calls on both the session setup <b>delay</b> and call <b>release</b> <b>delay,</b> while the second object is to verify the result of changing transport modes of transport protocol for both session setup <b>delay</b> and call <b>release</b> <b>delay.</b> The results obtained from first simulation showed that utilizing UDP as transport protocol will return less session setup delay than TCP and SCTP. The first objective of the second simulation results clarify the relationship between number of simultaneous calls on both the session setup <b>delay</b> and call <b>release</b> <b>delay</b> which was directly proportional; on the other hand the second object showed that by using UDP in mono socket mode has less session setup <b>delay</b> and call <b>release</b> <b>delay.</b> Näktergalsvägen 4 A 37160 Lyckeby Karlskrona Sweden + 4673927240...|$|R
