25|$|The film {{features}} two {{allusions to}} Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo. Like that film, it features recurring images of spirals, {{such as the}} 'Spirale' Cafe behind Manni's phone box and the spiral staircase down which Lola runs. In addition, the painting on {{the back wall of}} the casino of a woman's head seen from behind is based on a shot in Vertigo: Tykwer disliked the empty space on the wall behind the roulette table and commissioned production designer Alexander Manasse to paint a picture of Kim Novak as she appeared in Vertigo. Manasse could not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> looked like in the film; therefore, he decided to paint the famous shot of the back of her head. The painting took fifteen minutes to complete. The bed sheets in the red scenes also feature spiral designs which add to the allusion.|$|E
2500|$|Bernhardt had a {{remarkable}} ability to memorize a role quickly. She recounted in L'Art du Théâtre that [...] "I {{only have to}} read a role {{two or three times}} and I know it completely; but the day that I stop playing the piece the role escapes me entirely... My memory can't contain several parts at the same time, and it's impossible for me to recite off-hand a tirade from Phèdre or Hamlet. And yet I can remember the smallest events from my childhood." [...] She also suffered, particularly early in her career, bouts of memory loss and stage fright. Once, she was seriously ill before a performance of L'Etrangére at the Gaiety Theater in London, and the doctor gave her a dose of painkiller, either opium or morphine. During the performance, she went on stage, but could not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was supposed to say. She turned to another actress, and announced, [...] "If I made you come here, Madame, it is because I wanted to instruct you in what I want done... I have thought about it, and I do not want to tell you today", then walked offstage. The other actors, astonished, quickly improvised an ending to the scene. After a brief rest, her memory came back, and Bernhardt went back on stage, and completed the play.|$|E
6000|$|... "Her memory {{seems to}} fail her a little," [...] Ethel {{whispered to her}} brother; [...] "or she will only <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wishes. Don't you see that she has grown very much older?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{a thought}} flashed into her mind, as <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had {{seen at the}} station some months ago.|$|R
60|$|Their affectionate mother shared {{all their}} grief; <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had herself endured {{on a similar}} occasion, five-and-twenty years ago.|$|R
60|$|She {{laughed in}} a half-hysterical manner, and he <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{had said about}} the treasury, and that fares are high in that country.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{cannot be}} {{in a house}} {{where there is a}} child!" [...] said Tommy, with a bitter laugh. [...] "Gemmell, it is Grizel we are {{speaking}} of! Do you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little Joscelyn wasn't {{much of a}} talker," [...] said Aunty Nan dreamily. [...] "She {{was kind}} of a quiet child. But you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did say. And I've never {{forgotten}} little Joscelyn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't exactly <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said, she {{was very}} grave {{and said it was}} no {{laughing}} matter, or something of that kind, and she walked up and down and begged me to be quiet and let her think." ...|$|E
60|$|She came to {{her senses}} again, but seeing her husband alive before her, and <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had seen, she shrieked again, and fell into another swoon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of that, your Highness, I {{can recall}} nothing, or very little," [...] then, doubtless <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{had just said}} to me, she made obeisance and passed from the chamber.|$|R
60|$|He smiled, but her humility {{gave him}} a curious twist in his heart. Poor thing! He <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had been when first he knew her. He hesitated for an instant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not that, I assure you! She was a {{very nice}} little companion, and we quite enjoyed her {{readiness}} and intelligent interest; but she was a little too much excited to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was about when she was startled." ...|$|E
60|$|Ah, {{it was a}} dull agony to her to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{had been}} then. For it was remembering a dead self. All that was dead after Winifred. She knew the corpse of her young, loving self, she knew its grave. And the young living self she mourned for had {{scarcely}} existed, it was the creature of her imagination.|$|E
6000|$|Sir Giles was too angry to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{had said}} {{to him on the}} {{previous}} night, or he might have guessed at the motive which had led to her departure. [...] "Her father has done with her already," [...] he said; [...] "and I have done with her now." [...] The servants received orders not to admit Miss Henley, if her audacity contemplated a return to her godfather's house.|$|E
6000|$|Gerald's colour rose, but Marian's eye met his, and he <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had said, and {{answered}} quietly, [...] "I don't know whether Fern Torr is poky, {{but it is}} a place where people are taught to behave well." ...|$|R
60|$|Clifford Baxter {{came into}} the sitting-room where Patty was darning {{stockings}} and reading a book at the same time. Patty could do things like that. The stockings were well darned too, and Patty understood and <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> read.|$|R
50|$|She {{was only}} 27 years old during the {{proclamation}} of independence on August 31, 1957. <b>She</b> still <b>remembers</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wore on that momentous occasion — an off-white silk sari {{with a red}} border, a personal favourite {{as it had been}} an engagement gift from Sambanthan.|$|R
60|$|Agatha saw Wyllard {{only once}} again, {{and that was}} when he called early one morning. He got down from the wagon where Dampier sat, and shook hands with her and Allen and Mrs. Hastings. Few words were spoken, and she could not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said, but when he swung himself up again and the wagon jolted away into the white prairie {{she went back to the}} house with a feeling of loss and depression.|$|E
60|$|When the {{salesman}} came to her, Edna did not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had asked to see, but whatever he brought {{she did not}} want, and going out, she had her carriage called, and ordered her coachman {{to take her to}} the Gardens of the Tuileries. She was so excited that she did not wait for Cheditafa to get down, but opened the door herself, and stepped in quickly, even before the porter of the establishment could attend to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not <b>{{remember}}</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{said when}} she reached me, but I know she spoke very pleasantly; nor do I remember what I replied, but I am sure I did not speak pleasantly. I was out of humor with the whole world, and particularly with her. She brought a little chair that was near by, and sat down by me. She was a very straightforward person about speaking, and so she said, without any preface: ...|$|E
60|$|Patt laughed, {{and that}} so merrily as {{to cause the}} tones of her sweet voice to fill me with delight, as I <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had been in {{childhood}} and girlhood five years before, and she shook her bright tresses off her cheeks ere she would answer.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{a thought}} flashed into her mind, as <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had {{seen at the}} station some months ago. [...] "I wonder if the {{situation}} is an altogether unusual one to you," [...] she continued. [...] "Have you never let your pity run away with your judgment before?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{dreamed of}} him and her {{as they had been}} together. She could not dream of him progressively, of what he was doing now, of what {{relation}} he would have to her now. Only sometimes she wept to think how cruelly she had suffered when he left her--ah, how she had suffered! <b>She</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had written in her diary: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jeekie, Jeekie," [...] said Alan, [...] "exercise a Christian {{spirit and}} let bygones be bygones. If you don't, {{you will make}} a quarrel {{between us and the}} Ogula, and they will give us up to the Asiki. Perhaps the man did not eat your mother; I {{understand}} that he denies it, and when you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was like, it seems incredible. At any rate he has a right to a trial, and I will speak to Fahni about it to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{only saw}} Wyllard once again, {{and that was}} when he called at the {{homestead}} early one morning. He got down from the waggon where Dampier sat, and shook hands with her and Allen and Mrs. Hastings. Very few words were spoken, and she could not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said, but when he swung himself up again and the waggon jolted away into the white prairie {{she went back to the}} house with her heart beating unpleasantly fast and a very curious feeling of depression.|$|E
60|$|Charming {{was very}} much {{surprised}} by this answer, but he bowed low to the Princess, and begged her to accept the embroidered scarf and the tiny dog he had brought with him. But she answered {{that she did not}} want any presents, and that he was to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had just told him. When he got back to his lodging he went to bed without eating any supper, and his little dog, who was called Frisk, couldn't eat any either, but came and lay down close to him. All night Charming sighed and lamented.|$|E
50|$|Esmeralda overhears {{her aunt}} and Fernando {{discussing}} and discovers {{he is not}} really her father. She returns to her room, now understanding why he hates her so much. Esmeralda picks up her medallion and <b>remembers</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was told about her destiny. She realizes that her mother may still be alive. While taking a walk {{the next day she}} is approached by Azucena and Renzo.|$|R
60|$|Her belief {{only made}} the Colonel's Wife more wretched, because it insisted so {{strongly}} on the villainy of men. <b>Remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had done, it was pleasant {{to watch her}} unhappiness, and the penny-farthing attempts she made to hide it from the Station. But the Station knew and laughed heartlessly; for they had heard {{the story of the}} watch, with much dramatic gesture, from Mrs. Larkyn's lips.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. King's heart ached for {{the poor}} forlorn orphan, when <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{had heard of the}} nursing in Elbury Union. She {{did not know how to}} turn him from her door the day he had saved her son from danger such as she could not think of without shuddering; and yet, <b>what</b> could <b>she</b> do? Her rent and the winter before her, a heavy doctor's bill, and the loss of Alfred's work! ...|$|R
60|$|His dimmed {{mind was}} just clear enough to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had said, and with {{trembling}} fingers, that were almost powerless to grasp, he drew it out. As {{he did so}} the song grew sweeter and more tender than before, but he shut his ears to it and bent his head over the shell. Out of its depths arose the voice of Julia singing to him as she had sung when {{she gave him the}} shell, and though the notes sounded faint at first, they swelled louder and louder till the mist which had gathered about him was blown away.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} when Lucy told him to, {{and it was}} {{pleasant}} to find what he required ready at hand, {{instead of having to}} walk backward and forward between the table and the stove. He did not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said, but they both laughed every now and then, and after the meal was over he was content to sit still a while when she bade him. The presence of the girl somehow changed the whole aspect of the room; but he was conscious of a regret that it was she and not another who occupied the place opposite him across his table. It was not Lucy Calvert he had often pictured sitting there. At length he pointed through the doorway to the grain.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{know you}} do, sir,' {{returned}} Mr. Peggotty, 'and thankee again. Mas'r Davy, he can <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was; you may judge {{for your own}} self what she is; but neither of you can't fully know what she has been, is, and will be, to my loving art. I am rough, sir,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'I am as rough as a Sea Porkypine; but no one, unless, mayhap, it is a woman, can know, I think, what our little Em'ly is to me. And betwixt ourselves,' sinking his voice lower yet, 'that woman's name ain't Missis Gummidge neither, though she has a world of merits.' Mr. Peggotty ruffled his hair again, with both hands, as a further preparation for {{what he was going}} to say, and went on, with a hand upon each of his knees: ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{his funeral}} she stands {{to make a}} speech but {{declares}} that no words could {{ever be able to}} show how wonderful her father really was. Instead, she decides to share with them the song she helped finish. Before she sits down to play, sunlight shines through the stained glass window. Ronnie smiles and says [...] "Hi, Daddy," [...] <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> overheard her father tell Jonah earlier in the movie; that whenever light shines through the window, it's him.|$|R
50|$|This {{episode is}} {{a remake of}} The Twilight Zone classic episode that {{originally}} starred Anne Francis. It differs from the original in that the characters Marsha meets are more menacing, and {{the tone of the}} episode is much heavier on suspense. The episode also differs in that rather than <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is and accepting her fate as Marsha did in the original, the other mannequins force Marsha back into her true form so that another mannequin can take her place.|$|R
60|$|When we {{came away}} {{he made himself}} amends for his silence by a long hymn in worship of her, and I listened with all the {{acquiescence}} possible. He asked me questions--whether I had noticed this thing or that about her, or <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had said upon one point or another, and led up to compliments of her which I was glad to pay. In the long ordeal they had undergone they had at least kept all the freshness of their love.|$|R
