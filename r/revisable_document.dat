Where by choice or circumstance only a single <b>revisable</b> <b>document</b> format can be used this should be for a format around which there is industry consensus, {{as demonstrated by the}} format's adoption as a standard.|$|E
5000|$|MO:DCA {{supports}} <b>Revisable</b> <b>Documents,</b> {{which are}} editable like revisable-form text, Presentation Documents, which provide specific output formatting similar to final-form text, and Resource Documents, which hold control {{information such as}} fonts. An MO:DCA file consists of a sequential, ordered hierarchy of independent objects - documents, pages, data objects, and resource objects such as fonts and ICC profiles. Each object is delimited by begin/end structures, and objects to be rendered specify presentation parameters and resource requirements in structures called [...] "environment groups". Since the pages in MO:DCA documents appear in sequential order, presentation can start {{as soon as the}} first page is received.|$|R

Some {{progress has}} been made on the translation of page description languages [...] Postscript to Interpress and Interpress to Postscript. However, these developments are of no assistance in the sharing of documents that may need to be revised. The ISO OSI standards for <b>revisable</b> form <b>documents</b> interchange continue to evolve with the Standard Generalized Markup Language, the Office Document Architecture, and the Office document Interchange Format offering great promise for the future. While the ultimate solution to document interchange is universal acceptance of an interchange standard, some intermediate solution is required to meet the needs that exist today. It is in this context that document conversion systems are considered. The approaches to conversion fall in two broad categories. The first category includes systems that hard code each conversion. The second category of system rely on an intermediate metalanguage [...] a standard. This paper describes a hybrid system for converting files created by one text processing system to a format suitable for another. The discussions covers the design principles for an extended machine and table driven approach. Tables allow for user involvement in customizing and developing new conversions while an extended machine allows for logical and arithmetic control of the conversion. The paper describes the kinds of copymarks found in text files, sets out the scope of what a copymark conversion engine must do, describes how various approaches tackle the problem, and describes how the conversion engine produced accomplishes these goals...|$|R
