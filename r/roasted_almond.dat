40|$|AbstractAlthough almonds {{have a high}} lipid content, their {{consumption}} is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. One explanation for this paradox could be limited bioaccessibility of almond lipids due to the cell wall matrix acting as a physical barrier to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract. We aimed to measure the rate and extent of lipolysis in an in vitro duodenum digestion model, using raw and <b>roasted</b> <b>almond</b> materials with potentially different degrees of bioaccessibility. The results revealed that a decrease in particle size led to an increased rate and extent of lipolysis. Particle size had a crucial impact on lipid bioaccessibility, since it is {{an indicator of the}} proportion of ruptured cells in the almond tissue. Separated almond cells with intact cell walls showed the lowest levels of digestibility. This study underlines the importance of the cell wall for modulating lipid uptake and hence the positive health benefits underlying almond consumption...|$|E

In this work we isolated almond-specific recombinant antibody fragments (scFv) from a commercial phage display library bypassing the use of live animals, hence being consistent with the latest policies on animal welfare. To this end an iterative selection procedure employing the Tomlinson I phage display library and a crude almond protein extract was carried out. Two different almond-specific scFv (named PD 1 F 6 and PD 2 C 9) were isolated after two rounds of biopanning, and an indirect phage ELISA was implemented to detect the presence of almond protein in foodstuffs. The isolated scFvs demonstrated to be highly specific and allowed detection of 40 ng mL? 1 and 100 ng mL? 1 of raw and <b>roasted</b> <b>almond</b> protein, respectively. The practical detection limit of the assay in almond spiked food products was 0. 1 mg g? 1 (110 e 120 ppm). The developed indirect phage ELISA was validated by analysis of 92 commercial food products, showing good correlation with the results obtained by a previously developed real-time PCR method {{for the detection of}} almond in foodstuffs. The selected phage clones can be affinity maturated to improve their sensitivity and genetically engineered to be employed in different assay formats...|$|E
40|$|Muitas espécies do Cerrado ainda são pouco conhecidas, assim como suas características bioquímicas e seu potencial para processamento de alimentos. Este trabalho teve como objetivo caracterizar bioquimicamente a amêndoa de chichá da espécie Sterculia striata A. St. Hill & Naudin, oriunda de Corrente (Piauí) e verificar alterações na composição química e no teor de fatores antinutricionais após torrefação. A amêndoa de chichá mostrou-se ser um alimento com alto teor de proteínas, fibras, fósforo, cobre, zinco e manganês. A torrefação realizada a 205 °C por 11 min resultou em perda de umidade de 6, 0 % para 2, 1 % e diminuição do fitato de 10, 6 mg/g para 5, 5 mg/g. A ausência de fatores antinutricionais como lectinas, taninos e inibidores de tripsina e alfa-amilase foi também um resultado importante. Verificou-se a ausência de {{peroxidase}} e polifenoloxidase e conteúdo de compostos fenólicos de 107, 7 mg/ 100 g e 108, 9 mg/ 100 g para amêndoas cruas e torradas, respectivamente. Por fim, têm-se ácidos graxos poliinsaturados linoléico (3, 8 %) e linolênico (2, 3 %), altos teores de monoinsaturados (40 %) e saturados (34, 5 %) e presença de ácidos graxos ciclopropenoídicos. Assim, pode-se afirmar que a amêndoa de chichá é um alimento rico em nutrientes, mas é preciso investigar os efeitos da ingestão de ácidos ciclopropenoídicos na concentração encontrada. Este trabalho reforça a necessidade de conhecer e conservar as plantas nativas do CerradoMany {{species from}} Cerrado remain unknown in their biochemical characteristics {{and in their}} potential for food processing. This work had as objective to characterize the almond of chichá from the specie Sterculia striata A. St. Hill & Naudin, originated from Corrente (Piauí) in their biochemical components, analyze {{the changes in the}} chemical composition and the amounts of antinutritional factors after roasting. The almond of chicha presented high levels of protein, fiber, phosphorus, copper and manganese. The roasting held to 205 °C for 11 minutes reduced the content of humidity from 6. 0 % to 2. 1 % and phytates from 10, 6 mg/g to 5. 5 mg/g. There were no lectins, tannins, trypsin inhibitors and alpha-amylase was also a important result obtained. It was verified the absence of the enzymes polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase and a content of phenolics in the range of 107. 7 mg/ 100 g and 108. 9 mg/ 100 g in the raw and <b>roasted</b> <b>almond</b> respectively. The almond of chicha presented polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic (3, 8 %) and linolenic acid (2, 3 %), high levels of monounsaturated (40 %) and saturated (34. 5 %) and presence of fatty acids cyclopropenoid. Therefore, the almond chichá is rich in nutrients; however it is necessary to investigate the effects of eating cyclopropenoid in the concentration found in these almonds. This work reinforces the necessity of conservation and in deep studies of native plants from Cerrad...|$|E
