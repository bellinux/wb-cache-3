5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of roentgenium has yet to have been established due to the low yields of reactions that produce roentgenium isotopes. For chemical studies {{to be carried out}} on a transactinide, at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1second, and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> must be at least one atom per week. Even though the half-life of 281Rg, the most stable known roentgenium isotope, is 26seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle is the need to increase the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> of roentgenium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the roentgenium isotopes and allow automated systems to experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of roentgenium, as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements. However, the experimental chemistry of roentgenium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium, despite early interest in theoretical predictions due to relativistic effects on the ns subshell in group 11 reaching a maximum at roentgenium.|$|E
5|$|The slow <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> for the Hamilcar {{appears to}} be the result of a {{combination}} of factors. There was a great demand on the specific types of wood required to build the glider, and difficulty in finding suitably large airfields with enough skilled personnel where the gliders could be constructed and stored; it also appears that a lack of official priority and poor management at GAL also impeded production. Between March and August 1942 GAL had promised eighteen Hamilcars would be built and delivered, but by September only one had actually appeared; this slow <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> so concerned the Ministry of Aircraft Production that it appointed an 'Industrial Panel' of three senior industrial experts to visit GAL and detail the causes of the problems. The panel visited GAL in early September 1942 and issued a report on 24 September which stated that the root of the problems was that GAL appeared to have taken a bigger workload than it could handle, which was exacerbated by poor organisation and management skills. There were also conflicts between GAL and the Hamilcar Production Group which hurt production; the Group had been formed by the Ministry on 28 July in an attempt to speed up production, but senior GAL managers resented this and failed to co-operate fully with the Group. The panel also identified a 'piecemeal method of ordering' by the Ministry of Aircraft Production as a cause of further delays. Ultimately several senior managers and staff at GAL were replaced on the recommendation of the panel in an attempt to decrease internal conflicts and speed up production.|$|E
5|$|A {{spontaneous}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leak {{is one of}} several types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E

5|$|Arguments rumbled on {{and there}} were endless delays. Early {{versions}} of the sticky bomb were prone to leaks as well as breakage in transport. There were understandable concerns over the explosive charge: pure nitroglycerin is notoriously susceptible to the slightest knock, but the mixture developed by ICI proved to be very safe even if it should get into the hinges of the storage boxes. By December 1940, fewer than 66,000 had been produced and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> was disappointing at five to ten thousand per week. Further, {{it was suggested that}} the original order of one million be reduced to 200,000. Minor improvements to the design were made, of which the most significant was to replace the glass flask with plastic. Finally, after passing all the required tests, the sticky bomb – now the No 74 Grenade Mk II – was accepted by the Ordnance Board; it was put into full-scale production and it became a service issue.|$|E
5|$|Between 1926 and 1933 {{numerous}} other local productions were released. Although Dutchmen like Heuveldorp and G. Krugers {{continued to be}} active in the industry, the majority of filmmakers and producers were ethnic Chinese. The Tan brothers (Khoen Yauw and Khoen Hian) and The Teng Chun were major producers during this period, while the Wong brothers (Nelson, Othniel, and Joshua) were among the more prominent directors. During the mid-1930s, production dropped {{as a result of}} the Great Depression. The release of Albert Balink's commercially and critically successful Terang Boelan (Full Moon) in 1937 led to renewed interest in filmmaking, and 1941 saw thirty locally produced films. This <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> declined after the Japanese occupation beginning in early 1942, closing all but one film studio; this resulted in several films which had begun production in 1941 being released several years later. The majority of films produced during the occupation were short propaganda pieces. Following the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence in 1945 and during the ensuing revolution several films were made, by both pro-Dutch and pro-Indonesian backers; the Dutch formally recognised Indonesia's sovereignty on 27 December 1949, leaving the Dutch East Indies defunct.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine a}} generic set of {{amplitude}} equations proposed earlier by Haken {{that describes the}} emergence and bifurcations of modes and spatio-temporal patterns of selforganizing non-equilibrium systems. We relate feedback parameters occurring in the amplitude equations to pumping processes associated with entropy production. In doing so, we show that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> entropy <b>production</b> determines which mode-mode transitions are allowed and which not. Roughly speaking, transitions occur from modes <b>of</b> low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> entropy <b>production</b> towards modes <b>of</b> high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> entropy <b>production</b> (selection principle). In line with the recent efforts {{in the field of}} physical intelligence, we outline how physical, non-algorithmic, self-organizing systems satisfying Haken’s amplitude equations may be used to design a dynamic input-output message buffer. The functioning of such a dynamic buffer again follows the aforementioned selection principle: the buffer switches between input and output modes in order to select modes with relatively high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> entropy <b>production.</b> Moreover, only mode-mode transitions are allowed that increase the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> entropy <b>production</b> <b>of</b> the active mode...|$|R

40|$|Cloned {{division}} genes (ftsQ and ftsA) and {{the gene}} for beta-lactamase (bla) were transcribed in vivo from a bacteriophage T 7 promoter under conditions which blocked the use of other promoters. The different coding regions of single mRNAs were translated with widely different efficiencies, such that the ratio <b>of</b> beta-lactamase <b>production</b> to FtsQ production was about 75 : 1. The relative <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> translation of the division proteins reflected their relative <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> from normal chromosomal promoters (FtsA greater than FtsQ). We show that the low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> FtsQ and FtsA proteins are due to their ribosome-binding sequences {{and that there is}} no obligatory translational coupling between them, despite the close proximity of the genes. Levels of translation of FtsA are shown to be proportional to levels of transcription, and therefore {{there is no evidence of}} variable regulation of translation...|$|R

40|$|The {{optimization}} of ultrasonic irradiation as {{an advanced}} oxidation {{technology can be}} achieved by adjusting the ultrasonic frequency and saturating gas during sonolysis. The sonolytic <b>production</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen peroxide (H_ 2 O_ 2) and hydroxyl radical (•OH) has been investigated at the ultrasonic frequencies of 20, 40, 80, and 500 kHz, respectively, in the presence of four different saturating gases (i. e., Kr, Ar, He, O_ 2) at each frequency. H_ 2 O_ 2 was measured with a KI dosimeter, and the formation of •OH was monitored by trapping with terephthalic acid. Both the applied frequency and the physicochemical properties of the saturating gases influ ence the sonochemical <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> •OH and H_ 2 O_ 2. At 20 kHz, the rate contants for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> H_ 2 O_ 2 vary over an order of magnitude {{as a function of the}} nature of the dissolved gas (0. 0508 and 1. 31 μM min^(- 1)). Similar trends are observed for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> •OH at the same frequencies and under an identical set of saturating gases. The highest <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> H_ 2 O_ 2 (pH 7, 2. 94 μM min^(- 1)) and •OH (pH 11, 0. 391 μM min^(- 1)) are observed during sonolysis of Kr-saturated solutions at 500 kHz. Sonolysis of He-saturated solutions at 20 kHz results in the lowest <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> H_ 2 O_ 2 (0. 0508 μM min^(- 1)) and •OH (0. 0310 μM min^(- 1)).
