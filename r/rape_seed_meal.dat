40|$|When {{rape oil}} is {{chemically}} extracted, <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal,</b> a solid residue remains. Currently, {{it is used}} as animal feed. Several plants {{for the production of}} rape methyl ester (RME, biodiesel) are in operation or under construction. Combustion properties have been studied for <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> produced as a by product to rape-methyl esther (RME, biodiesel). Composition of the material has been measured, using proximate and ultimate analysis. The lower heating value was 18. 2 ± 0, 3 MJ/kg d. w. and the ash content was 7 - 8 percent d. w. The material is rich in nitrogen and sulphur. Concentrations of K, P, Ca and Mg are high in the fuel. <b>Rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> was mixed with bark and pelletised. Bark pellets were also used as a reference fuel. Pellets with 10 and 30 percent <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> were produced. Material with 80 percent <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> and 20 percent planer shavings was also pelletised. Wood had to be added to provide enough friction in the pelletising process, with adapted equipment <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> could probably be easily pelletised). The material was studied using Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), and compared with data from tests with wood powder. The pyrolysis of the <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> has a characteristic temperature of 320 oC. Devolatilisation starts at 150 oC (at a lower temperature than for wood powder), and proceeds within a rather wide temperature range. The probable cause is the difference in organic content, in particular protein content. The result does not suggest that the material will be difficult to ignite. Experiments in a bench-scale fluidised bed (5 kW) showed that pellets containing only bark, and the mixture rape seed meal/wood had a bed agglomeration temperature well over the normal operational bed temperature. For the fuel mixtures <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> and bark, the agglomeration temperature was slightly over the operational temperature. Particle emissions from fluidised bed combustion and grate combustion were, the latter simulated using a commercial pellet burner, were roughly doubled with fuels containing <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> compared to bark. In the powder burner tests, particle emissions increased with a factor 17 with <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> compared to wood powder. The emitted particles were mainly found in the fine (1 µm) and a fine mode fraction. The particles from grate combustion of bark contain mostly K, S, Na and Cl apart from oxygen and carbon. When <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> is present, Cl and Na concentrations decrease considerably and the main contents of the particles are K and S (and O and C). The results from the X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD) analyses showed the presence of crystalline K 2 SO 4 och KCl. The fine particles (< 1 µm) from powder combustion contain mainly K, P and S. The only identified crystalline phase was K 2 SO 4, suggesting that most phosphorus was in the amorphous phase, i. d. most probably molten. The deposit formation on a cooled probe was studied during the fluidized bed and powder combustion experiments. The fine particles deposited during fluidised bed combustion contained K, Cl and S. When bark was combusted in the fluidised bed, the coarse fraction contained Ca and Si, when <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> in different mixes was combusted this changed to P, K, Ca and Mg. The deposits formed during combustion of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> in the powder burner were mainly made up of phosphates (Ca-, Mg/K-, Ca/Mg-phosphates) and MgO. Sintered material (slag) from grate combustion of bark contained mainly Si, Ca, K and Al, probably as silicates. Adding <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> tended to increase P, Ca and Mg while Si and Ca content tended to decrease. Through XRD a number o crystalline phases in the sintered material {{and the rest of the}} bottom ashes could be identified. NO emissions from the combustions tests increased two to four times with <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> compared to typical wood fuels. For the fluidised bed test, SO 2 concentrations were rather high for the <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> pellets (with 20 percent wood), still only about 20 percent of the sulphur in the fuel formed SO 2. For the grate combustion and powder burner combustion, 60 percent and 70 percent of the sulphur respectively formed SO 2. HCl emissions were low for all tests. The rather high emissions of NOx and SOx mean that the material should be used in large-scale facilities with external SOx and NOx cleaning. In smaller facilities, the material may be used in small amounts mixed with other fuels. The risk of slagging is not very high, and should not rule out grate combustion of pellets with <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> mixed with other fuels. The risk of corrosion of superheater surfaces during combustion is probably low since the smaller-size particles formed at fluidised bed combustion and grate combustion contain K 2 SO 4. However, a large fraction of the particles formed in powder burner combustion probably contains low temperature melting K 2 PO 4, making the risk for deposit formation significant. <b>Rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> for powder burner applications should be used with care. The content of phosphorus in the material may be an advantage when mixes of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> and other fuels are considered. The high affinity between potassium and phosphorus means that more sulphur in the fuel will be available for sulphatising of any KC. (formed from combustion of many forest and agricultural fuels). Use of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> as a sulphur containing additive could thus be an option. For grate combustion and fluidised bed combustion, addition of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> may reduce the risk of slagging and bed agglomeration, respectively. Full scale tests in fluidised beds or grate combustors with problematic biofuels (containing Cl and K) would be useful to test whether ash-reduced operational problems could be reduced through the addition of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal.</b> Effektiva värmevärdet hos rapsmjöl är 18, 2 +/- 0, 3 MJ/kg TS och askhalten varierar mellan 7 - 8 %. Bränslet har högt N- och S-innehåll, och bränslet är rikt på K, P, Ca och Mg. Partikelemissionerna från fluidbäddseldning och rosterförbränning med rapsmjölsblandningar var ungefär dubbelt så höga som från barkförbränning. Vid pulverförbränning av rapsmjöl ökade partikelemissionerna med en faktor 17 jämfört med träpulver. De höga NOx och SOx emissionerna från rapsmjölsförbränning innebär att materialet bör utnyttjas i storskaliga anläggningar med extern svavel. - eller NO-rening, eller i relativt låga inblandningsgrader i andra bränslen. Mindre anläggningar med enbart cyklonrening är olämpliga på grund av de höga stofthalterna. Rapsmjöl torde vara ett intressant sameldningsbränsle vid roster- och fluidbäddseldning med klor- och kaliumrika skogs- och åkerbränslen då rapsmjöl eventuellt skulle kunna användas som svaveladditiv för reduktion av klorinducerad korrosion på t ex överhettare.

This study compared the nematode-suppressive ability of four <b>seed</b> <b>meals</b> obtained from Brassica juncea ‘Pacific Gold’, B. napus ‘Dwarf Essex’ and ‘Sunrise’, and Sinapis alba ‘IdaGold’, against mixed stages of Pratylenchus penetrans and Meloidogyne incognita second-stage juveniles (J 2). The brassicaceous <b>seed</b> <b>meals</b> were applied to soil in laboratory assays at rates ranging from 0. 5 to 10. 0 % dry w/w with a nonamended control included. Nematode mortality was assessed after 3 days of exposure and calculated as percentage reduction compared to a nonamended control. Across <b>seed</b> <b>meals,</b> M. incognita J 2 were {{more sensitive to the}} brassicaceous <b>seed</b> <b>meals</b> compared to mixed stages of P. penetrans. Brassica juncea was the most nematode-suppressive <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> with rates as low as 0. 06 % resulting in > 90 % suppression of both plant-parasitic nematodes. In general B. napus ‘Sunrise’ was the least nematode-suppressive <b>seed</b> <b>meal.</b> Intermediate were the <b>seed</b> <b>meals</b> of S. alba and B. napus ‘Dwarf Essex’; 90 % suppression was achieved at 1. 0 % and 5. 0 % S. alba and 0. 25 % and 2. 5 % B. napus ‘Dwarf Essex’, for M. incognita and P. penetrans, respectively. For B. juncea, <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> glucosinolate-degradation products appeared to be responsible for nematode suppression; deactivated <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> (wetted and heated at 70 °C for 48 hr) did not result in similar P. penetrans suppression compared to active <b>seed</b> <b>meal.</b> Sinapis alba <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> particle size also played a role in nematode suppression with ground meal resulting in 93 % suppression of P. penetrans compared with 37 to 46 % suppression by pelletized S. alba <b>seed</b> <b>meal.</b> This study demonstrates that all <b>seed</b> <b>meals</b> are not equally suppressive to nematodes and that care should be taken when selecting a source of brassicaceous <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> for plant-parasitic nematode management...|$|R
40|$|Published by American Phytopathological SocietyThe {{effect of}} <b>seed</b> <b>meals</b> derived from Brassica juncea, B. napus, or Sinapis alba on {{suppression}} of soilborne pathogens inciting replant disease of apple was evaluated in greenhouse trials. Regardless of plant source, <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> amendment significantly improved apple growth in all orchard soils; however, relative differences in pathogen suppression were observed. All <b>seed</b> <b>meals</b> suppressed root infection by native Rhizoctonia spp. and an introduced isolate of Rhizoctonia solani AG- 5, though B. juncea <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> often generated {{a lower level}} of disease control relative to other <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> types. When introduction of the pathogen was delayed until 4 to 8 weeks post <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> amendment, disease suppression was associated with proliferation of resident Streptomyces spp. and not qualitative or quantitative attributes of <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> glucosinolate content. Using the same experimental system, when soils were pasteurized prior to pathogen infestation, control of R. solani was eliminated regardless of <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> type. In the case of B. juncea <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> amendment, the mechanism of R. solani suppression varied in a temporal manner, which initially was associated with the generation of allylisothiocyanate and was not affected by soil pasteurization. Among those tested, only B. juncea <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> did not stimulate orchard soil populations of Pythium spp. and infection of apple roots by these oomycetes. Although application of B. napus <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> alone consistently induced an increase in Pythium spp. populations, no significant increase in Pythium spp. populations was observed in response to a composite B. juncea and B. napus <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> amendment. Suppression of soil populations and root infestation by Pratylenchus spp. was dependent upon <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> type, with only B. juncea providing sustained nematode control. Collectively, these studies suggest that use of a composite B. juncea and B. napus <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> mixture can provide superior control of the pathogen complex inciting apple replant disease relative to either <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> used alone...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} {{the performance of}} commercial PCR-based Salmonella enterica detection methods (BAX System Q 7, the iQ-Check Salmonella II kit, and the TaqMan Salmonella enterica detection kit) with culture-based methods (modified semisolid Rappaport-Vassiliadis [MSRV] and NMKL 71) in spiked and naturally contaminated samples of feed mill scrapings (FMS), palm kernel meal (PKM), pelleted feed (PF), <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> (RSM), soybean meal (SM), and wheat grain (WG). When results from the various feeds were compared, the number of Salmonella enterica CFU/ 25 g required to produce a positive were as follows: PKM > FMS = WG > RSM = SM = PF. These data {{are similar to those}} developed in earlier studies with culture-based Salmonella detection methods. PCR-based methods were performed similarly to culture-based methods, with respect to sensitivity and specificity. However, many PCR positives could not be confirmed by Salmonella isolation and for that reason the evaluated methods were found to be suitable only when rapid results were paramount. Nevertheless, PCR-based methods cannot presently replace culture-based methods when typing information is required for tracing studies or epidemiological investigations. The observed difference in detection levels is a potential problem when prevalence data are compared as well as when feed ingredients are tested for conformance with microbiological criteria.

40|$|Mustard <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> is the {{material}} that remains after oil is extracted from the seeds of plants in the mustard (Brassica) family. When {{in the presence of}} water, this <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> releases compounds that can suppress plant diseases and weeds. As a result, mustard <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> was investigated as an alternative method for disease and weed control, in an effort to reduce synthetic pesticide usage. Further, few studies examined the use of mustard <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> for application in the commercial greenhouse industry, which is a large consumer of synthetic chemicals. Instead, many researchers assessed the <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> in an outdoor setting. This project bridged the gap in literature and evaluated mustard <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> as an additive to the soilless potting medium commonly used in the greenhouse industry. In a laboratory setting, the <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> was successful in killing two species of the plant pathogen Pythium, which commonly causes root-rotting diseases. In a greenhouse setting, the mustard <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> prohibited Pythium from killing tomato and cucumber seedlings but also damaged the seedlings at higher application rates. These observations were investigated in another series of experiments to identify a maximum <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> application rate. In these experiments, <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> rates up to 0. 4 % (by volume) did not decrease or delay germination. When a sowing delay of one day was employed, there were no decreases or delays in germination for seeds grown in medium combined with <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> at rates up to 2. 4 %. Increasing the duration of the sowing delay up to seven days did not yield any added benefits. These experiments' data suggest adding <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> up to 2. 4 % (by volume) will not decrease or delay germination {{as long as there is}} a minimum of one day between combining the potting medium and <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> and sowing the seeds. However, seedlings that were transplanted into the same potting medium and mustard <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> combinations were more sensitive than seeds.

40|$|Abstract Background Animal feed as {{a source}} of {{infection}} to food producing animals is much debated. In order to increase our present knowledge about possible feed transmission {{it is important to know}} that the present isolation methods for Salmonella are reliable also for feed materials. In a comparative study the ability of the standard method used for isolation of Salmonella in feed in the Nordic countries, the NMKL 71 method (Nordic Committee on Food Analysis) was compared to the Modified Semisolid Rappaport Vassiliadis method (MSRV) and the international standard method (EN ISO 6579 : 2002). Five different feed materials were investigated, namely wheat grain, soybean meal, <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal,</b> palm kernel meal, pellets of pig feed and also scrapings from a feed mill elevator. Four different levels of the Salmonella serotypes S. Typhimurium, S. Cubana and S. Yoruba were added to each feed material, respectively. For all methods pre-enrichment in Buffered Peptone Water (BPW) were carried out followed by enrichments in the different selective media and finally plating on selective agar media. Results The results obtained with all three methods showed no differences in detection levels, with an accuracy and sensitivity of 65 % and 56 %, respectively. However, Müller-Kauffmann tetrathionate-novobiocin broth (MKTTn), performed less well due to many false-negative results on Brilliant Green agar (BGA) plates.

40|$|Global {{rapeseed}} {{production has}} undergone sustained {{growth over the}} past 20 years. Having surpassed cottonseed production in the early 2000 ’s, {{it is now the}} second most produced oilseed behind soybeans. The major producers are China, India, Canada and European Union (27). During this same period, rapeseed crushing has risen strongly, Europe being the major player in this expansion (development of biodiesel) followed to a lesser extent by Canada and China. World exports of rapeseeds are dominated by Canada, by far the largest exporter. Japan is a traditional importer, while China and the EU (27) are less regular buyers. Although less spectacular than palm oil growth, rapeseed oil growth is also remarkable. Its consumption occurs mainly in the crushing countries, the EU being the principal consumer. Rapeseed meal is the second major oilseed meal produced worldwide (after soybean meal). It has been following broadly the same trends as seeds and oils, this evolution was marked a short period of stagnation in the early 2000 ’s. Consumption of rapeseed meal has grown strongly in the EU (which is deficient in protein feed), in China (due to its extraordinary economic development), and in the USA (due to milk producers’ demand for feed). The main exporters of rapeseed meals are Canada and India.

The NS fraction was obtained after centrifugation of the filtrate and comprised 0 % to 87 % of N in the filtrate. Soluble protein (TP) in the supernatant was obtained after precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and N in the remaining supernatant was defined as non-protein N (NPN). Significant amounts of TP were found in soybean meal (58 %), lupine meal (30 %) and rapeseed meal (27 %) as percent of total N in the filtrate. NPN ranged from 13 % to 100 % of N in the filtrate. The in vitro incubation of the protein N (NS + TP) showed that all fractions were not completely degraded, suggesting a potential participation as escape protein. Fine particles in the filtrate have similar degradation rates as the residue left in the filter. It is concluded that the washout fraction consisted of different crude protein fractions that were not always completely and immediately degraded in the rumen...|$|E

All silages were ensiled using a formic acid based additive 5 l t- 1. Milk production responses to energy and protein supplementation of diets were studied. In Exp. 1, BS replaced GS at the rates of 0, 200, 400 or 600 g kg- 1 forage DM. Also 10 kg of concentrate containing 0 or 2 kg of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> was fed. In Exp. 2, barley was harvested at three times (BS 1, BS 2, BS 3) at one week intervals. Barley silages were fed as a mixture with GS (40 : 60) and in addition BS 2 and GS alone. Silages were supplemented with a cereal based farm-made concentrate (FC) or a commercial compound having a lower concentration of starch than FC. In Exp. 3, barley and wheat were harvested at two week intervals, fed as a mixture with GS (40 : 60) and supplemented with low or high amount of concentrate. The fermentation quality of whole crop silages was good. Weather conditions and maturity affected the proportion of ear in the crop and subsequently the ratio of non-structural carbohydrates to NDF in the silage. The inclusion of WCS depressed diet OM digestibility depending on the digestibility of GS and the proportion of WCS in the diet. However, mixing GS and WCS did not depress intake. Subsequently the use of mixtures maintained or even increased milk yield as compared with GS diet in Exp. 2 and 3. In Exp. 1, higher proportions (400, 600 g kg- 1) of BS decreased milk yield. Minor effects of growth stage on milk production were observed with barley whereas delaying wheat harvest increased milk yield. Different types and levels of concentrate induced mainly similar intake and milk yield responses with diets based on GS alone or on mixtures of GS and WCS. The synergistic effect of mixing GS and WCS was more positive in experiments where the protein concentration of concentrate was high (200 g kg- 1 DM). ...|$|E
40|$|A {{digestibility}} {{trial was}} carried out with 140 Ross-broiler chichens (age 24 days) to determine coefficient of ileal apparent digestibility (CIAD) of amino acids in meat and bone meal (MBM), full-fat soyabeans (FFSs), soyabean cake and meal, full-fat rape seeds, and rape seed cake and meal. The birds were fed semi-purified diets which contained protein feedstuffs as a sole protein source and chromium mordanted straw as an indigestible marker. The CIAD of nutrients were assessed using slaughter technique. A 37 -day growth experiment {{was carried out}} with 2880 Ross-broiler chichens to compare feed formulation systems based on apparent ileal digestible or total lysine content. three barley based diets were formulated to be similar in total lysine content (9. 5 g/kg feed). Diet 1 contained soyabean meal (SBM) (280 g/kg DM), Diet 2 SBM (180 g/kg DM) and <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> (RSM) (171 g/kg DM) and Diet 3 a combination of SBM (78 g/kg DM), RSM (172 g/kg DM) and MBM (87 g/kg DM). The composition of Diets 4 and 5 {{was similar to that}} of diets 3 and 4, respectively, except that they were supplemented with L-lysine-HCl to obtain a similar apparent ileal digestible lysine content in Diet 1 / 7. 9 g/kg feed). The total lysine content of Diets 4 and 5 was 10 g/kg feed. Furthermore, Diet 1 was supplemented with L-lysine-HCl to obtain Diet 6, in which the total and apparent ileal digestible lysine contents were 10 and 8. 5 g/kg feed, respectively. CIAD of lysine, methionine, threonine and cystine were respectively 0. 60, 0. 66, 0. 48 and 0. 34 for MBM; respectively 0. 81, 0. 75, 0. 68, and 0. 67 for FFSs; respectively 0. 86, 0. 86, 0. 76 and 0. 62 for soyabean cake; respectively 0. 85, 0. 84, 0. 74 and 0. 63 for SBM; respectively 0. 59, 0. 59, 0. 43 and 0. 53 for full-fat rapeseeds; respectively 0. 68, 0. 81, 0. 64 and 0. 53 for rapeseed cake; and respectively 0. 63, 0. 75, 0. 54 and 0. 43 for RSM. Final weight and growth rate were highest when digestible lysine based feed formulation was used compared to that based on total lysine (P < 0. 001). The increase in final weight was largest for diet containing MBM and formulated based on digestible lysine (P < 0. 001). In addition, the proportion of breast muscle of total live-weight and weight of breast muscle increased (P < 0. 05) in animals fed diets formulated on the basis of digestible compared to total lysine. However, diet formulation based on digestible lysine impared feed conversion tatio compared to that of total lysine for birds fed SBM as the sole source of supplementary protein compared to diets containing rapeseed or MBM (P < 0. 01). Growth rate and final weight were higher in birds fed diets containing SBM alone compared to those also containing RSM and MBM (P < 0. 001). In addition, the effect of diet formulation based on digestible lysine on performance results of broilers was more obvious in males than females (P < 0. 05). The results indicate that formulation of diets based on a digestible lysine was better than that based on total lysine when diets contained protein sources of low amino acid digestibility such as meat and bone meal and RSMs. v 2002 okEripainoksia saatavissa tekijält...|$|E
