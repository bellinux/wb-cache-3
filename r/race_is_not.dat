5|$|Wade {{writes that}} along with the ongoing social {{evolution}} that occurred after humans left Africa, the human physical form also continued to evolve. This {{is the subject of}} chapter nine, Race; because humans were spread across different continents, and distance and tribal hostility limited gene flow between them, they followed different evolutionary paths. <b>Race</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> well understood, he says, because its historical implications cause it to be avoided in modern academic studies. Wade states, however, that there are reasons to reconsider the study of it; the genetic differences between races may give evidence of the different evolutionary pressures they faced, and the differences may be medically relevant. Citing Neil Risch, Wade puts forth that there are five continental races – Africans, Caucasians, Asians, Pacific Islanders and Native Americans – which are made up of smaller subdivisions called ethnicities. He explicitly avoids discussing the cause of IQ differences between races, but hypothesises that racial differences may have an influence on sporting achievement. Chapter ten, Language, concerns the spread and division of languages. Wade believes that all languages ultimately came from an ancestral language, and that many of its descendants – such as Proto-Indo-European – possibly spread through agriculture. By citing linguists such as Joseph Greenberg, Wade shows that almost all of today's languages belong to families, which in turn may belong to superfamilies such as Eurasiatic.|$|E

500|$|The erasure of DeVine {{from the}} {{narrative}} places the white female bodies {{as the only}} true victims of crime; and the film's inability to show DeVine as violated rather than violator perpetuates {{the myth of the}} black man as always already a perpetrator of crime." [...] Regarding DeVine, Halberstam wrote, [...] "Peirce perhaps thought that her film, already running close to two hours, could not handle another subplot, but the story of Philip DeVine is important and it is a crucial part of the drama of gender, race, sexuality, and class that was enacted in the heartland. <b>Race</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> incidental to this narrative of mostly white, Midwestern small towns and by omitting DeVine's story from Boys Don't Cry, Peirce contributes to the detachment of transgender narratives from narratives about race, consigning the memory of DeVine to oblivion." ...|$|E
500|$|The Oxford trial saw Per Terram line {{up against}} Per Mare, so named {{to commemorate the}} 350th anniversary of the {{foundation}} of the Royal Marines whose motto is [...] "Per Mare, Per Terram" [...] ("By sea, by land"). [...] Per Terram, stroked by the Oxford University Boat Club president Louloudis, took an early lead and were half-a-length ahead before Per Mare recovered the deficit to be level by Barn Elms. [...] A spurt from Per Terram at the Mile Post saw them regain the lead but at Harrods Furniture Depository, Per Mare took the lead back, shooting Hammersmith Bridge precisely and holding a three-quarter length lead by St Paul's School. [...] Both crews experienced fierce winds with Per Terram coping better and taking a half-length advantage. [...] Per Mare kept in touch through to Barnes Bridge but Per Terram pushed on and passed the finishing post with a winning margin of two lengths. Oxford's coach Bowden was cautious, stating that the [...] "trial shows that Oxford is in good shape, but this <b>race</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the only bit of the trials process".

[...] He added: [...] "There is no yellow card offence between a warning and disqualification". [...] Oxford coach Sean Bowden blamed the defeat on the restart: [...] "We rowed with a lot of courage ... but having to restart after that great first take-off really hurt us.

500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was against}} Derby County at the newly built Pride Park Stadium. They were awarded a penalty {{kick in the}} first half after Patrick Vieira was fouled by Lee Carsley; Wright hit the penalty, which ricocheted off the goal crossbar. Two goals by Paulo Wanchope and a late strike by Dean Sturridge {{condemned}} Arsenal to their first defeat of the league season. Arsenal played Manchester United on 9 November 1997 and needed a win to stay one point behind the league leaders. Wenger admitted in his pre-match comments that a second successive defeat would make it [...] "difficult" [...] for them to catch Manchester United, but not [...] "impossible". Striker Nicolas Anelka, standing in for Bergkamp, scored his first goal for Arsenal and Vieira added a second, leaving goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel rattled. Although Teddy Sheringham scored twice for Manchester United to level the score, midfielder David Platt headed into the far corner with seven minutes left of the match to score the winner for Arsenal. Wenger said of the win: [...] "This result is good for the English game because it will stimulate interest in the Premier League" [...] and opposing manager Alex Ferguson half agreed: [...] "A one-horse <b>race</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> good for the game." [...] Arsenal failed to capitalise on the result, losing to Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool, in a period where the team were depleted due to injuries.|$|E

[...] He argues that race in itself is not biologically determined, but socially created: [...] "For the record, <b>race</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a scientifically sound assumption. For example, there is no DNA difference between human beings. We are all African. Biologically, race does not exist. It is a social and cultural construct ... The U.S. is {{a country with a}} long history of social genocide (Native Americans, African slavery, etc.) and this was all due to the seeming differences we attributed to race.

2500|$|In {{his role}} as manager, Zimmer took over a team that had {{finished}} in seventh place in 1902. [...] By the first of June 1903, the Phillies were struggling with an 11-26 record. Zimmer at that time acknowledged that the [...] "task of managing a team that does not stand so well up in the <b>race</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the most pleasant one in the world", but he insisted {{that he was not}} discouraged and noted that the greater satisfaction comes not from taking charge of a first-class team and keeping it going, but [...] "to take hold of a team that is down in the race and bring it up to a high standard." [...] The Phillies did improve late in the season, compiling a 16-13 record in their last 29 games. However, with a seventh-place finish, the 1903 season was Zimmer's only one as a Major League manager. [...] In fairness to Zimmer, the Phillies simply lacked the talent to compete with the best teams in the National League, had finished in seventh place in 1902 under Bill Shettsline, and dropped to eighth place in 1904 under Hugh Duffy.|$|E
2500|$|Disparate {{treatment}} {{can be justified}} under CRA 1964 §2000e-2(e) if an employer shows selecting someone reflects by [...] "religion, sex, or national origin is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise." [...] <b>Race</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> included. For example, in Dothard v Rawlinson the state of Alabama prohibited women from working as prison guards in [...] "contact" [...] jobs, with close proximity to prisoners. It also had minimum height and weight requirements (5"2 and 120 lbs), which it argued were necessary for proper security. Ms Rawlinson claimed both requirements were unlawful discrimination. A majority of 6 to 3 held that the gender restrictions in contact jobs were a bona fide occupational qualification, {{because there was a}} heightened risk of sexual assault, although Stewart J suggested the result might have differed if the prisons were better run. A majority held the height and weight restrictions, while neutral, had a disparate impact on women and were not justified by business necessity. By contrast, in Wilson v Southwest Airlines Co, a Texas District Court held an airline was not entitled to require women only to work as cabin attendants (who were further required to be [...] "dressed in high boots and hot-pants") even if it could show a consumer preference. The essence of the business was transporting passengers, rather than metaphorically [...] "spreading love all over Texas", so that there was no [...] "bona fide occupational requirement". Under the ADEA 1967, age requirements can be used, but only if reasonably necessary, or compelled by law or circumstance. For example, in Western Air Lines, Inc v Criswell the Supreme Court held that airlines could require pilots to retire at age 60, because the Federal Aviation Authority required this. It could not, however, refuse to employ flight engineers over 60 because there was no comparable FAA rule.|$|E
