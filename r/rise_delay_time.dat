40|$|We present {{continuous}} coupling {{experiments and}} calculations of two mutually flow-rate-coupled Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) oscillators. The Ce 4 + -concentration of one BZ-reactor controls the flow rate {{into the other}} BZ-reactor and vice versa. Flow-rate control {{is proportional to the}} difference between the (<b>time</b> <b>delayed)</b> Ce 4 + - and an average Ce 4 +- concentration. When both period one (P 1) BZ oscillators are weakly coupled, the P 1 oscillations are retained in both oscillators whose periods increase with increasing coupling strength. At high coupling strengths statistically aperiodic oscillations are produced. The introduction of <b>time</b> <b>delayed</b> coupling does not reduce the noise in the strongly coupled system. We distinguish between statistical aperiodicity due to experimental noise and deterministic chaos due to the system’s nonlinear dynamics.

40|$|The {{maximum speed}} of {{synchronous}} circuits is generally {{constrained by the}} worst case propagation delay, which limits the system clock frequency. Various techniques exist to manage the circuit delay, trading off speed for other system resources.

40|$|Historically {{the design}} of linear control systems was {{developed}} with a wealth of graphical tools such as Bode plot, Nyquist plot, gain-phase plot, and Nichols chart, which are all {{carried out in the}} frequency domain. The advantage of these tools is that they can all be sketched by following approximation methods without detailed plotting. There for, the designer can carry out designs using frequency domain specifications such as gain margin, phase margin, and so on. High-order systems generally do not pose any particular problem. For certain types of controller design procedures in the frequency domain are available which reduce the trial-and-error effort to a minimum. Design in the time domain using such performance specifications as <b>rise</b> <b>time,</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time,</b> settling time, maximum overshoot, and so on, is feasible analytically only for second-order systems, or systems that can be approximated by second-order systems. General design procedures using time-domain specifications are difficult to establish for systems with order higher than the second. The development and availability of high-powered and user-friendly computer software is rapidly changing the practice of control system design. With modern computer software tools, the designer can go through a large number of design runs using the time-domain specifications within a matter of minutes. State equations have the ability to represent linear and nonlinear control system with constant coefficients and those varying with time. Analysis in the frequency domain depends on the Laplace transform, which is capable of representing only linear time invariant systems. Since differential equations representing nonlinear-time variant systems are very difficult to solve analytically, we need a powerful tool to solve them, numerically. (MATLAB offers this tool).

METHODS: A total of 6588 female breast cancer patients from 12 countries were surveyed. Total <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> was determined as the sum of the patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> (time between onset of the first symptoms and the first medical visit) and system-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> (time between the first medical visit and the start of therapy).
