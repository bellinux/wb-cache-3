25|$|In {{negative}} repressible operons, transcription of the operon normally takes place. Repressor proteins {{are produced}} by a regulator gene, but {{they are unable to}} bind to the operator in their normal conformation. However, certain molecules called corepressors are bound by the <b>repressor</b> <b>protein,</b> causing a conformational change to the active site. The activated <b>repressor</b> <b>protein</b> binds to the operator and prevents transcription. The trp operon, involved in the synthesis of tryptophan (which itself acts as the corepressor), is a negatively controlled repressible operon.|$|E
25|$|In {{negative}} inducible operons, {{a regulatory}} <b>repressor</b> <b>protein</b> is normally {{bound to the}} operator, which prevents the transcription of the genes on the operon. If an inducer molecule is present, it binds to the repressor and changes its conformation {{so that it is}} unable to bind to the operator. This allows for expression of the operon. The lac operon is a negatively controlled inducible operon, where the inducer molecule is allolactose.|$|E
25|$|The PTET {{promoter}} {{plays an}} integral {{role in the}} expression of both plasmids. It drives transcriptional expression of both the sgRNA of interest and cas9 in the host cell upon induction with anhydrotetracycline (aTc). In {{the absence of the}} inducer, the PTET promoter is repressed by the constitutively expressed tetracycline <b>repressor</b> <b>protein</b> (TetR). Therefore, the presence of TetR in the host cell prior to the introduction of both sgRNA and cas9 is a measure to avoid cell lethality.|$|E
5000|$|In prokaryotes, {{regulator}} genes often {{code for}} <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins.</b> <b>Repressor</b> <b>proteins</b> bind to operators or promoters, preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing RNA. They are usually constantly expressed so the cell {{always has a}} supply of repressor molecules on hand. [...] Inducers cause <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins</b> to change shape or otherwise become unable to bind DNA, allowing RNA polymerase to continue transcription. Regulator genes can be located within an operon, adjacent to it, or far away from it.|$|R
50|$|The mSin3 {{interaction}} domain (SID) is {{an interaction}} domain which is present on several transcriptional <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins</b> including TGFβ (transforming growth factor β) and Mad. It {{interacts with the}} paired amphipathic alpha-helix 2 (PAH2) domain of mSin3, a transcriptional repressor domain that is attached to transcription <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins</b> such as the mSin3A corepressor.|$|R

25|$|The lac operon of {{the model}} {{bacterium}} Escherichia coli was the first operon to be discovered and provides a typical example of operon function. It consists of three adjacent structural genes, a promoter, a terminator, and an operator. The lac operon is regulated by several factors including the availability of glucose and lactose. It can be activated by allolactose. Lactose binds to the <b>repressor</b> <b>protein</b> and prevents it from repressing gene transcription. This {{is an example of}} the derepressible (from above: negative inducible) model.|$|E
25|$|While P. aeruginosa {{undergoes}} primarily anaerobic desaturation, it also undergoes two aerobic pathways. One pathway utilizes a Δ9-desaturase (DesA) that catalyzes {{a double}} bond formation in membrane lipids. Another pathway uses two proteins, DesC and DesB, together {{to act as}} a Δ9-desaturase, which inserts a double bond into a saturated fatty acid-CoA molecule. This second pathway is regulated by <b>repressor</b> <b>protein</b> DesT. DesT is also a repressor of fabAB expression for anaerobic desaturation when in presence of exogenous unsaturated fatty acids. This functions to coordinate the expression of the two pathways within the organism.|$|E
25|$|The first plasmid {{used in the}} {{pioneering}} work of Reisch and Prather is composed of: the cas9 gene {{under the control of}} the PTET promoter; the tetR gene, which codes for tetracycline <b>repressor</b> <b>protein,</b> under control of a constitutive promoter; and the cmr gene for chloramphenicol resistance. It was observed that leaky expression of Cas9 occurred even without induction of the PTET promoter. Therefore, to avoid cell death, a transfer messenger RNA (ssrA) tag was included in the plasmid downstream of the cas9 gene. In the event of leaky Cas9 expression, the C-terminal ssrA tag would be recognized by ClpP protease and degrade Cas9 to allow for better expressional control of the protein. Together, these components make up the pCas9cr4 plasmid and allow targeting of the host cell chromosome.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} provides altered lac <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins</b> that {{recognize the}} lactose operator with increased affinity and have either normal or enhanced ligand responsivity. For example, the lac repressor Gln 60 Gly mutant protein exhibits increased binding affinity for lactose operator DNA, while maintaining near-normal responsivity to IPTG. Alternatively, the present invention provides modified repressors which exhibit responsiveness to an alternative ligand, such as arabinose, or have enhanced responsivity to IPTG. For example, Gln 60 Gly/Leu 148 Phe binds with wild-type affinity to lactose operator DNA and exhibits enhanced responsivity to IPTG. The present invention also provides for repressors that exhibit both characteristics: increased affinity for lactose operator and enhanced ligand responsivity. Enhanced ligand response enables induction of gene expression to be finely {{controlled by a}} researcher. DNA sequences encoding the altered lac <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins</b> and bacterial and eukaryotic cells containing altered lac <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins</b> are also provided...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe hypoxia {{responsive}} region (HRR) of the VEGF promoter plays a {{key role}} in regulating VEGF expression. We found that the cold shock domain (Y-box) <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins,</b> dbpA and dbpB/YB- 1, bind distinct strands of the human VEGF HRR. We find both dbpA and dbpB are phosphorylated by ERK 2 and GSK 3 β in vitro, and the binding of dbpB to single-strand VEGF HRR DNA is regulated by this phosphorylation. These findings suggest the ERK/MAPK and PI 3 K pathways may regulate VEGF expression in part through regulating the action of these <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R
25|$|HIV, the {{retrovirus}} {{that causes}} AIDS in humans, produces a single primary RNA transcript, which is alternatively spliced in multiple ways to produce over 40 different mRNAs. Equilibrium among differentially spliced transcripts provides multiple mRNAs encoding different {{products that are}} required for viral multiplication. One of the differentially spliced transcripts contains the tat gene, in which exon 2 is a cassette exon that may be skipped or included. The inclusion of tat exon 2 in the RNA is regulated by competition between the splicing repressor hnRNP A1 and the SR protein SC35. Within exon 2 an exonic splicing silencer sequence (ESS) and an exonic splicing enhancer sequence (ESE) overlap. If A1 <b>repressor</b> <b>protein</b> binds to the ESS, it initiates cooperative binding of multiple A1 molecules, extending into the 5’ donor site upstream of exon 2 and preventing the binding of the core splicing factor U2AF35 to the polypyrimidine tract. If SC35 binds to the ESE, it prevents A1 binding and maintains the 5’ donor site in an accessible state for assembly of the spliceosome. Competition between the activator and repressor ensures that both mRNA types (with and without exon 2) are produced.|$|E
2500|$|Operator – {{a segment}} of DNA that a {{repressor}} binds to. [...] It is classically defined in the lac operon as a segment between the promoter and the genes of the operon.

2500|$|Discovered in 1953 by Jacques Monod and colleagues, the trp operon in E. coli was {{the first}} repressible operon to be discovered. [...] While the lac operon can be {{activated}} by a chemical (allolactose), the tryptophan (Trp) operon is inhibited by a chemical (tryptophan). [...] This operon contains five structural genes: trp E, trp D, trp C, trp B, and trp A, which encodes tryptophan synthetase. [...] It also contains a promoter which binds to RNA polymerase and an operator which blocks transcription when bound to the protein synthesized by the repressor gene (trp R) that binds to the operator. [...] In the lac operon, lactose binds to the <b>repressor</b> <b>protein</b> and prevents it from repressing gene transcription, while in the trp operon, tryptophan binds to the <b>repressor</b> <b>protein</b> and enables it to repress gene transcription. [...] Also unlike the lac operon, the trp operon contains a leader peptide and an attenuator sequence which allows for graded regulation. This {{is an example of}} the corepressible model.|$|E
5000|$|Homeodomain {{proteins}} {{are found}} in eukaryotes [...] Through the HTH motif, they share limited sequence similarity and structural similarity to prokaryotic transcripiton factors, [...] such as lambda phage proteins that alter the expression of genes in prokaryotes. The HTH motif shows some sequence similarity but a similar structure {{in a wide range}} of DNA-binding proteins (e.g., cro and <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins,</b> homeodomain proteins, etc.). One of the principal differences between HTH motifs in these different proteins arises from the stereo-chemical requirement for glycine in the turn which is needed to avoid steric interference of the beta-carbon with the main chain: for cro and <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins</b> the glycine appears to be mandatory, whereas for many of the homeotic and other DNA-binding proteins the requirement is relaxed.|$|R
50|$|They {{can either}} be enhancers (increasing expression) or {{silencers}} (decreasing expression). They act by binding activator or <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins</b> (transcription factors) and the intervening DNA bends such that the bound proteins contact the core promoter and RNA polymerase.|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the JAK-STAT pathway, IFNs can activate several other signaling cascades. [...] For instance, both type I and type II IFNs activate {{a member of the}} CRK family of adaptor proteins called CRKL, a nuclear adaptor for STAT5 that also regulates signaling through the C3G/Rap1 pathway. [...] Type I IFNs further activate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) to induce gene transcription. [...] Antiviral and antiproliferative effects specific to type I IFNs result from p38 MAP kinase signaling. [...] The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is also regulated by both type I and type II IFNs. [...] PI3K activates P70-S6 Kinase 1, an enzyme that increases protein synthesis and cell proliferation; phosphorylates of ribosomal protein s6, which is involved in protein synthesis; and phosphorylates a translational <b>repressor</b> <b>protein</b> called eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (EIF4EBP1) in order to deactivate it.|$|E
2500|$|Also, a mutant of lambda <b>repressor</b> <b>protein</b> {{has been}} shown to shift from {{downhill}} to two-state upon changing the temperature/solvent conditions. However, the status of BBL as a downhill-folding protein, and by extension the existence of naturally occurring downhill folders, has been controversial. The current controversy arises {{from the fact that the}} only way a protein can be labeled as two-state or downhill is by analyzing the experimental data with models that explicitly deal with these two situations, i.e. by allowing the barrier heights to vary. Unfortunately, most of the experimental data so far have been analyzed with a simple chemical two-state model. In other words, the presence of a rather large free energy barrier has been pre-assumed, ruling out the possibility of identifying downhill or globally downhill protein folding. This is critical because any sigmoidal unfolding curve, irrespective of the degree of cooperativity, can be fit to a two-state model. Kinetically, the presence of a barrier guarantees a single-exponential, but not vice versa. Nevertheless, in some proteins such as the yeast phosphoglycerate kinase and a mutant human ubiquitin, non-exponential kinetics suggesting downhill folding have been observed.|$|E

40|$|Repression of GAL 1 {{expression}} during {{growth on}} glucose is mediated {{in part by}} cis-acting promoter elements designated URS(G). We show that oligonucleotides containing sequences from two regions of URS(G) confer glucose repression upon a heterologous promoter. Repression caused by URS(G) is dependent on trans-acting factors of the glucose repression pathway and is independent of orientation or location within a promoter, suggesting that URS(G) contains binding sites for a glucose-activated <b>repressor</b> <b>protein(s).</b> Genetic analysis identified three apparently novel genes (URR 1, URR 3 and URR 4) that are specifically required for URS(G) -mediated repression and may encode such <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins.</b> Mutations in the URR genes suppress the defect in URS(G) derepression caused by a snf 1 mutation...|$|R

40|$|The c 1 {{repressor}} gene of bacteriophage P 1 and the temperature-sensitive mutants P 1 c 1. 100 and P 1 c 1. 162 was cloned into an expression vector and the <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins</b> were overproduced. A rapid purification procedure {{was required for}} {{the isolation of the}} thermolabile <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins.</b> Identification of the highly purified protein of an apparent molecular weight of 33, 000 as the product of the c 1 gene was verified by (i) the coincidence of partial amino acid sequences determined experimentally to that deduced from the c 1 DNA sequence, and (ii) the temperature-sensitive binding to the operator DNA of the thermolabile <b>repressor</b> <b>proteins.</b> Analysis of the products of c 1 -c 1. 100 recombinant DNAs relates the thermolability to an unknown alteration in the C-terminal half of the c 1. 100 repressor. Binding to the operator DNA of c 1 repressor is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide. Since the only three cysteine residues are located in the C-terminal half of the repressor it is suggested that this part of the molecule is important for the binding to the operator DNA.
