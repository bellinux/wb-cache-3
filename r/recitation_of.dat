5|$|It {{rejects the}} Christian {{emphasis}} on sin and guilt, believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing {{that if an}} individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature. Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated <b>recitation</b> <b>of</b> mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a white light.|$|E

5|$|The Mantra yoga is {{stated by}} the Yogatattva as a {{discipline}} of auditory <b>recitation</b> <b>of</b> mantras but stated to be an inferior form of yoga.

5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} {{hard in the}} days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive tasks, such as turning the capstan to raise the anchor and heaving on ropes to raise and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the <b>recitation</b> <b>of</b> numbers.|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} stage, in {{documents}} {{written in the}} paleo-Hebrew script, words were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran. Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division, as suggested by Nahmanides {{in his introduction to}} the Torah. Word division using spaces was commonly used {{from the beginning of the}} 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script. In addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the musical motifs used in formal <b>recitation</b> <b>of</b> the text.|$|E

5|$|Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi, Matangi is {{the other}} Mahavidya, whose worship is {{primarily}} prescribed to acquire supernatural powers. A hymn in the Maha-bhagavata Purana asks her grace to control one's foes, while the Tantrasara says that <b>recitation</b> <b>of</b> her mantra, meditation on her form and her ritual worship gives one to the power to control people and make them attracted to oneself. Her devotees, especially Tantric sadhakas, are regarded to have transcend the pollution by offering her left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) and thus overcome their ego. Worship of Matangi is described to allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution, leading him to salvation or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals. The Purashcharyarnava describes pleasing the goddess would result in her answering all the devotee's queries by whispering in her ear.|$|E
5|$|Further {{light is}} shed upon Amenhotep's funerary cult by {{multiple}} documents which appear to detail the rituals dedicated to Amenhotep. Three papyri {{from the time}} of Ramesses II record the liturgy used by the priests, and reliefs at Karnak and Medinet Habu illustrate select rites and spells. The bulk of the rituals concern preparing for and conducting the daily offerings of libations for the idol, including a <b>recitation</b> <b>of</b> a ḥtp-dỉ-nsw formula, and purifying and sealing the shrine {{at the end of the}} day. The remainder of the rites concern how to conduct various feasts throughout the year. In these cases, Amenhotep's idol or a priest representing him is actually officiating the worship of Amun instead of being worshipped himself, which was not a typical cultic practice in ancient Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} some debate within Islam over {{whether it is a}} {{religious}} requirement, circumcision (called khitan) is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males. Islam bases its practice of circumcision on the Genesis 17 narrative, the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews. The procedure is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, however, it is a tradition established by Islam's prophet Muhammad directly (following Abraham), and so its practice is considered a sunnah (prophet's tradition) and is very important in Islam. For Muslims, circumcision is also a matter of cleanliness, purification and control over one's baser self (nafs). There is no agreement across the many Islamic communities about the age at which circumcision should be performed. It may be done from soon after birth up to about age 15; most often it is performed at around six to seven years of age. The timing can correspond with the boy's completion of his <b>recitation</b> <b>of</b> the whole Quran, with a coming-of-age event such as taking on the responsibility of daily prayer or betrothal. Circumcision may be celebrated with an associated family or community event. Circumcision is recommended for, but is not required of, converts to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Commemorations are for {{individuals}} or events {{which have been}} noteworthy {{in the life of}} the Church and in the history of Lutheranism in particular. These days do not take precedence over any other festival day, and if there is a conflict between a commemoration and a festival of any other rank, the commemoration is generally transferred to the next open weekday. If a commemoration falls on a Sunday where the color of the day is green, the collect for which that individual or event belong to could be said before the daily collect/prayer of the day or in place of it. For example, if September 13 fell on a Sunday and there was a desire to commemorate St. John Chrysostom, the pastor would recite the common of theologians and then the prayer of the day or the common of theologians on its own. The person may also be mentioned by name in the prayers of the faithful in addition to <b>recitation</b> <b>of</b> the applicable collect. Finally, their lives might be summarized or their teachings related to the day's lessons in some way.|$|E
5|$|On days of {{particular}} religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual. Their timing {{was based on}} the Egyptian civil calendar, which most of the time was far {{out of step with the}} astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection with the seasons. Most festivals took place at a single temple, but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests. In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the most elaborate temple ceremonies, accompanied by the <b>recitation</b> <b>of</b> hymns and the performance of musicians.|$|E

5|$|Scottish coronations were {{traditionally}} held at Scone Abbey, {{with the}} king seated on the Stone of Destiny. The original rituals were a fusion of ceremonies used by the kings of Dál Riata, based on the inauguration of Aidan by Columba in 574, and by the Picts from whom the Stone of Destiny came. A crown {{does not seem to}} have been used until the inauguration of AlexanderII in 1214. The ceremony included the laying on of hands by a senior cleric and the <b>recitation</b> <b>of</b> the king's genealogy. AlexanderIII was the last Scottish king to be crowned in this way in 1249, since the Stone was captured by the English forces of Edward I in 1296. It was later incorporated into the English Coronation Chair and its first certain use at an English coronation was that of HenryIV in 1399. Pope JohnXXII in a bull of 1329 granted the kings of Scotland the right to be anointed and crowned. No record exists of the exact form of the medieval rituals, but a later account exists of the coronation of the 17-month-old infant JamesV at Stirling Castle in 1513. The ceremony was held in a church, since demolished, within the castle walls and was conducted by the Bishop of Glasgow, because the Archbishop of StAndrews had been killed at the Battle of Flodden. It is likely that the child would have been knighted before the start of the ceremony. The coronation itself started with a sermon, followed by the anointing and crowning, then the coronation oath, in this case taken for the child by an unknown noble or priest, and finally an oath of fealty and acclamation by the congregation.|$|E
