40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification, that is, RFID, is one {{of important}} technologies in Internet of Things. <b>Reader</b> <b>collision</b> does impair the tag identification efficiency of an RFID system. Many developed methods, for example, the scheduling-based series, {{that are used to}} avoid RFID <b>reader</b> <b>collision,</b> have been developed. For scheduling-based methods, communication resources, that is, time slots, channels, and power, are optimally assigned to readers. In this case, <b>reader</b> <b>collision</b> avoidance is equivalent to an optimization problem related to resource allocation. However, the existing methods neglect the overlap between the interrogation regions of readers, which reduces the tag identification rate (TIR). To resolve this shortage, this paper attempts to build a reader-to-reader collision avoidance model considering the interrogation region overlaps (R 2 RCAM-IRO). In addition, an artificial immune network for resource allocation (RA-IRO-aiNet) is designed to optimize the proposed model. For comparison, some comparative numerical simulations are arranged. The simulation results show that the proposed R 2 RCAM-IRO is an effective model where TIR is improved significantly. And especially in the application of reader-to-reader collision avoidance, the proposed RA-IRO-aiNet outperforms GA, opt-aiNet, and PSO in the total coverage area of readers...|$|E
40|$|Prior work on {{anti-collision}} for Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems usually schedule adjacent {{readers to}} exclusively interrogate tags for avoiding <b>reader</b> <b>collisions.</b> Although such a pattern can effectively deal with collisions, {{the lack of}} readers' collaboration wastes numerous time on the scheduling process and dramatically degrades the throughput of identification. Even worse, the tags within the overlapped interrogation regions of adjacent readers (termed as contentious tags), even {{if the number of}} such tags is very small, introduce a significant delay to the identification process. In this paper, we propose a new strategy for collision resolution. First, we shelve the collisions and identify the tags that do not involve <b>reader</b> <b>collisions.</b> Second, we perform a joint identification, in which adjacent readers collaboratively identify the contentious tags. In particular, we find that neighboring readers can cause a new type of collisions, cross-tag-collision, which may impede the joint identification.

In this paper, we propose an efficient reader anti-collision algorithm using a polling server in dense and dynamic RFID networks with mobile readers. Owing to the assistance of the server, the readers can rapidly decide whether they can work or not without interfering neighbors, and can be easily synchronized.

40|$|Abstract — Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a {{means to}} {{identify}} and track objects using radio frequency transmission. An RFID system consists of readers and tags. Readers use radio signals {{to communicate with the}} tags. Tags may be active (battery powered) or passive (powered by the reader’s signals). RFID is increasingly being used in many applications such as inventory management, object tracking, retail checkout etc. The <b>reader</b> <b>collision</b> problem occurs when the signal from one reader interferes with the signal from other readers. Such interference can result in lack of communication between the readers and some of the tags in the vicinity leading to incorrect and inefficient operation of an RFID system. This problem is further aggravated when mobile/hand-held readers are used in the system. The evolving standards like ETSI EN 302 208 for RFID readers use a CSMA based protocol called “Listen Before Talk ” to reduce the <b>reader</b> <b>collision</b> problem. However, carrier sensing alone cannot solve the <b>reader</b> <b>collision</b> problem in RFID networks. For example, the signals from two readers that are out of range from each other, may still collide at the tags in the region between them. Although this aspect of the <b>reader</b> <b>collision</b> problem seems similar to the hidden terminal problem encountered in traditional wireless systems, existing solutions such as RTS-CTS mechanisms are not applicable. One of the reasons being: A reader may communicate with multiple tags simultaneously. Hence a seperate collision avoidance will be required between CTS sent by these multiple tags, making the protocol more complicated. In this paper, we describe Pulse, a distributed protocol to reduce reader collisions. The operation of the Pulse protocol is based on periodic beaconing on a separate control channel by the reader, while it is reading the tags. The protocol functions effectively not only with fixed RFID readers but also with mobile RFID readers. We show, using simulation in QualNet, that using Pulse protocol, the throughput (overall read rate) is increased by as high as 60 % as compared to “Listen Before Talk ” (CSMA) and by 232 % as compared to Colorwave. We also present an analytical model for our protocol in a single hop scenario...|$|E

One {{of the most promising}} is the Internet of Things (IoT), a vision in which the Internet extends into our daily activities through wireless networks of uniquely identifiable objects. Given that modern RFID systems are being deployed in large-scale for different applications, without optimizing reader's distribution, many of the readers will be redundant, resulting waste of energy. Additionally, eliminating redundant eaders can also decrease probability of <b>reader</b> <b>collisions,</b> as a result, enhancing system performance and efficiency. In this paper, an overlap aware (OA) technique is proposed for eliminating redundant readers. The OA is a distributed approach, which does not need to collect global information for centralizing control, aims to detect maximum amount of redundant readers could be safely removed or turned off with preserving original RFID network coverage. A significant improvement of the OA scheme is that the amount of "write-to-tag" operations could be largely reduced during the redundant reader identification phase.

However, practical implementation of item-level RFID-based applications necessitates solving some critical issues. Among these issues, reading tag data to identify a relatively large number of individual product items, which are usually packed in batches and distributed on pallets, is particularly a bottleneck, because it affects the accuracy and trustworthiness of batch distribution of products and all subsequent logistics operations in the supply chain. Current techniques for batch identification at item-level of palletised products suffer low reading rate and incomplete tag data acquisition, rendering the RFID systems unreliable. We address this issue by proposing a mechanised 3 D scanning method for identification of tagged products in large numbers to facilitate supply chain management. The proposed method requires installing RFID readers only in the X-Y plane. The readers scan tagged products in the X and Y directions while the pallet is simultaneously rotated around to be effectively scanned in the Z direction. Different scanning patterns are adopted to alleviate the problems due to randomness of tag orientation and <b>reader</b> <b>collisions.</b> As such, 3 D scanning of RFID tags for item-level applications is effectively achieved without incurring much hardware cost.
