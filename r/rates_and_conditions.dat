25|$|Wilson rose to {{prominence}} in the late 1880s, {{on the back of}} the success of his union and his involvement in various strikes, including the London dock strike of 1889. Wilson's union suffered in the early 1890s and almost collapsed in 1894. Its revival came in 1911, with the outbreak of a wave of seamen's and dockers' strikes in British ports. Despite his militant tactics, Wilson was a relative moderate whose goal was to establish friendly relations with shipowners and formal conciliation procedures in the shipping industry to enable disputes to be resolved without recourse to strikes or lockouts. This goal was steadily achieved after shipowners recognised the union in 1911 and began working closely with officials during the First World War. After 1917, wage <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> were set by the National Maritime Board, which represented the Shipping Federation and Wilson's union. In the 1920s, Wilson's reputation as a 'bosses' man' made him increasingly unpopular in the wider labour movement.|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Social {{interactions}} {{in small groups}} of juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) lead {{to the formation of}} dominance hierarchies. Dominant fish hold better positions in the environment, gain a larger share of the available food and exhibit aggression towards fish lower in the hierarchy. By contrast, subor-dinate fish exhibit behavioural inhibition, including reduced activity and feeding. The behavioural charac-teristics associated with social status are likely the result of changes in brain monoamines resulting from social interactions. Whereas substantial physiological benefits, including higher growth <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>condition</b> factor, are experienced by dominant trout, low social status appears to be a chronic stress, as indicated by sustained elevation of circulating cortisol concentrations in subordinate fish. High cortisol levels, in turn, may be responsible for many of the deleterious physiological consequences of low social status, including lower growth <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>condition</b> factor, immunosuppression <b>and</b> increased mortality. Circulating cortisol levels may also be a factor in determining the outcome of social {{interactions in}} pairs of rainbow trout, and hence in determining social status. Rainbow trout treated with cortisol {{were significantly more likely to}} become subordinate in paired encounters with smaller untreated conspecifics...|$|R

Juvenile anchovy fed predominately on zooplankton, the main prey items being copepods, {{and to a lesser extent}} on molluscs larvae, polychaete larvae and ostracods. Prey composition in the diet of the two cohorts differed from each other, and the vacuity index was significantly lower for the autumn cohort (20 %) than for the summer cohort (70 %). Juveniles from the summer cohort had higher growth (somatic and otolith growth) <b>and</b> better <b>condition</b> than individuals from the autumn cohort. Growth rates were 0. 74 mm d− 1 and 0. 59 mm d− 1 respectively. We also found that otolith daily increments widths were higher for the summer cohort. Sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration derived from satellite imagery (SeaWiFS), were used as the main environmental variables to analyze anchovy growth, <b>condition</b> <b>and</b> feeding. No relationships were observed between chlorophyll-a concentration and juvenile vacuity index, nor growth <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>condition.</b> Our study suggests that growth <b>and</b> <b>condition</b> differences among the two cohorts were mainly due to water temperature differences encountered by the fish during their larval and juvenile periods.

40|$|The linearized, {{relativistic}} Vlasov equations {{are analyzed}} for {{the stability of}} flute‐like modes in an infinite, collisionless plasma with a cold background and a relativistic annular electron beam situated in a uniform external magnetic field. Neglecting self‐fields, a dispersion equation is obtained for small thickness beams.

The most unstable oscillations are shown to be those with long wavelengths relative to {{the thickness of the}} beam. Growth <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> for instability are given for systems where the beam particles are charge neutralized by cold background ions, and when the beam particles are dilute compared with the background species. For rarefied beams, an instability occurs at the hybrid frequency of the background species where the growth rate depends on the beam thickness. As the background density increases, a critical value can be reached where the long‐wavelength oscillations are stabilized; and short‐wavelength oscillations become most unstable.

40|$|In {{quantitative}} microbial {{risk assessment}} (QMRA), food {{safety in the}} food chain is modeled and simulated. In general, prevalences, concentrations, and numbers of microorganisms in media are investigated in the different steps from farm to fork. The underlying <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> (such as storage times, temperatures, gas conditions, and their distributions) are determined. However, the logistic chain with its queues (storages, shelves) and mechanisms for ordering products is usually not taken into account. As a consequence, storage times-mutually dependent in successive steps in the chain-cannot be described adequately. This may have {{a great impact on}} the tails of risk distributions. Because food safety risks are generally very small, it is crucial to model the tails of (underlying) distributions as accurately as possible. Logistic performance can be modeled by describing the underlying planning and scheduling mechanisms in discrete-event modeling.

In this article, we present the application of discrete-event modeling {{in the context of a}} QMRA for Listeria monocytogenes in fresh-cut iceberg lettuce.

40|$|NOTHING is {{more central}} to Labor’s {{view of what}} makes Australia such {{a great place to}} live in than our long {{tradition}} of having an independent umpire to stop employers exploiting workers. Former Liberal prime minister Sir Robert Menzies shared that view; like others in the centre-left and centre-right, he argued that it was a key to Australia’s relative harmony and social equality compared to Britain or the United States. The independent umpire was one of the original demands of the union movement in the 1890 s. Labor supported Alfred Deakin when he introduced it at federal level, and it soon led to the groundbreaking Harvester judgement, which set minimum pay rates at levels that would allow a worker to support a family. In recent decades, Labor has been the greatest supporter of arbitration, with the Liberals much more ambivalent. True, one of the Keating government’s great reforms was to open up an alternative path through enterprise bargaining, but even those outcomes had to be run past the umpire. When John Howard’s WorkChoices allowed employers to ignore the commission and effectively impose <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> on workers, Labor was loud and fervent in its support for keeping the umpire.
