50|$|Two {{successive}} <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> {{tied around}} an object {{makes up the}} common clove <b>hitch.</b> Two successive <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> tied around the standing part of a rope is known as two half-hitches or <b>double</b> <b>half</b> <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Macram√© or macrame {{is a form}} of textile-making using {{knotting}} {{rather than}} weaving or knitting. Its primary knots are the square knot (a variant of the reef knot) and forms of [...] "hitching": full <b>hitch</b> and <b>double</b> <b>half</b> <b>hitches.</b> It was long crafted by sailors, especially in elaborate or ornamental knotting forms, to decorate anything from knife handles to bottles to parts of ships.|$|R
5000|$|Racquets are strung {{either with}} two {{separate}} strings (and thus four knots), {{or with a}} single string (resulting in only two knots). Sometimes, a hybrid of two different string types {{may be used in}} the same racquet. Traditionally, a <b>double</b> <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> has been used to tie off tennis string, along with a starting knot. Recently, new kinds of knots have been used called the [...] "pro-knot" [...] and [...] "Parnell knot". Along {{with the use of a}} starting clamp, this can make all the knots identical, and improve the aesthetics of a string job.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} a new <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> loop suture configuration on flexor tendon repair mechanics. Cadaver canine flexor digitorum profundus tendons were repaired with 4 - or 8 -strands, 4 - 0 or 3 - 0 suture, with and without <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> loops. An additional group underwent repair with <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> loops but without the terminal knot. <b>Half</b> <b>hitch</b> loops improved the strength of 8 -strand repairs by 21 % when 4 - 0, and 33 % when 3 - 0 suture was used, and caused a shift in failure mode from suture pullout to suture breakage. 8 -strand repairs with <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> loops but without a terminal knot produced equivalent mechanical properties to those without <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> loops but with a terminal knot. 4 -strand repairs were limited by the strength of the suture in all groups and, as a result, the presence of <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> loops did not alter the mechanical properties. Overall, <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> loops improved repair mechanics, allowing failure strength to reach the full capability of suture strength. Improving the mechanical properties of flexor tendon repair with <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> loops has the potential to reduce the postoperative risk of gap formation and catastrophic rupture in the early postoperative period...|$|R
50|$|The <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> with slip is {{one with}} no extra bight, no extra turn, just a slip inside the <b>half</b> <b>hitch,</b> much weaker {{than all of}} the above hitches.|$|R
50|$|The Water Bowline can be tied {{very quickly}} by {{throwing}} two <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> over the working end and then running the working end around the standing line and back through both <b>half</b> <b>hitches.</b> This {{is illustrated in}} the three pictures below.|$|R
50|$|One {{instance}} where a <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> {{stands on}} its own without additional embellishment is when added to a timber hitch to help stabilize a load {{in the direction of}} pull. A timber hitch is tied on {{the far end of the}} load to bind it securely and a <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> made at the forward end to serve as a guide for the rope. In this instance, the <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> combined with a timber hitch is known as a killick hitch or kelleg hitch.|$|R
50|$|A fireman's chair knot (or simply chair knot) is a knot tied in the bight forming two adjustable, {{lockable}} loops. The knot {{consists of}} a handcuff knot finished with a locking <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> around each loop. The loops remain adjustable until the <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> are tightened.|$|R
5000|$|The {{buntline}} hitch, when bent to a yard, makes a {{more secure}} knot than two <b>half</b> <b>hitches,</b> but is more liable to jam. It differs from two <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> in that the second half hitchis inside instead of outside the first one. The Ashley Book of Knots ...|$|R

50|$|The {{result is}} a {{flattened}} loop which is held at each end by a <b>half</b> <b>hitch.</b> If {{the sides of the}} flattened loop are pulled away from each other, the flattened loop ends pull out of the <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> and the knot falls apart, but if the free endsare pulled taut then the knot remains secure.|$|R

5000|$|Two <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> is the commonest of all hitches for mooring in {{particular}} and also for general utility. Steel gives the name in 1794. The difference between two <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> and the clove hitch is that the former, after a single turn around a spar, is made fast around its own standing part, while the latter is tied directly around the spar.

50|$|The {{round turn}} and two <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> is a hitch used {{to secure the}} end of a rope to a fixed object. The name refers to the {{components}} used to form the knot: a round turn wraps the rope around the object (completely encircling it) and the two <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> secure the end around the standing part. Variations of this hitch can be made with differing numbers of turns and half-hitches; an example is illustrated below.|$|R
50|$|The knot is {{attractive}} to the eye and so is used decoratively for French whipping which {{is also known as}} <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> whipping.|$|R
50|$|Once tight, the trucker's hitch {{is often}} secured with a <b>half</b> <b>hitch,</b> usually slipped for easy {{releasing}} {{and to avoid}} the necessity {{of access to the}} end of the rope, though a more secure finish, such as two half-hitches, may be called for. Under large loads, the finishing <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> can jam, especially if it is not slipped; the difficulty of releasing it can be compounded by the fact that the knot is typically still under tension when it is untied.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> with a figure-eight knot, {{preferred}} over a bowline {{because it}} allows the sail {{to get closer to}} the top of the mast.|$|R
50|$|The {{shoelace}} knot is a doubly slipped {{reef knot}} formed by joining {{the ends of}} whatever is being tied with a <b>half</b> <b>hitch,</b> folding each of the exposed ends into a loop (bight) and joining the loops with a second <b>half</b> <b>hitch.</b> The size of the loops {{and the length of}} the exposed ends are adjusted when the knot is tied. It has the stability of the reef knot but is significantly easier to untie, simply by pulling the ends away {{from the center of the}} knot.|$|R

50|$|The double harness bend with {{parallel}} ends is {{an unfinished}} Reever knot: The ends {{need to go}} through the opposite <b>half</b> <b>hitch,</b> to be lined up with its own rope body.|$|R
50|$|French {{whipping}} is a whipping knot {{that consists}} {{of a series of}} <b>half</b> <b>hitches.</b> It is used to stop unraveling of rope ends as well as to provide a grip over railings.|$|R
50|$|The double harness bend is an {{unfinished}} Fisherman's knot (or even a Double fisherman's knot): the end {{needs to go}} through its own <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> (twice) to form a (double) overhand knot.|$|R
50|$|The {{sizes of}} the two loops can also be fixed by making <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> with each end over the necks of the loops. This {{configuration}} {{is known as the}} fireman's chair knot.|$|R
50|$|Knots, {{such as the}} clove <b>hitch</b> and <b>half</b> <b>hitch,</b> {{are used}} for rope line terminations. For example, hitches are used to {{terminate}} hemp lift lines at battens and operating lines at counterweight arbors.|$|R
50|$|The double harness bend with {{parallel}} ends is {{an unfinished}} Blood knot: The <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> {{need to take}} one or several turns around both ropes before going through the eye in the middle.|$|R
50|$|The strip's main character, <b>Half</b> <b>Hitch,</b> was short, rather lazy, and {{intensely}} {{interested in}} the pursuit of women. Other characters included the ship's stern captain, various NCOs and sailors, and Poopsy, Hitch's pet seagull.|$|R
