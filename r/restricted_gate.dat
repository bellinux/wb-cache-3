40|$|Abstract. In the past, {{due to the}} <b>restricted</b> <b>gate</b> count {{available}} on an inexpensive chip, embedded DSPs have had limited parallelism, few registers and irregular, incomplete interconnectivity. More recently, with increasing levels of integration, embedded VLIW processors have started to appear. Such processors typically {{have higher levels of}} instruction-level parallelism, more registers, and a relatively regular interconnect between the registers and the functional units. The central challenges faced by a code generator for an EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) or VLIW processor are quite different from those for the earlier DSPs and, consequently, so is the structure of a code generator that is designed to be easily retargetable. In this paper, we explain the nature of the challenges faced by an EPIC or VLIW compiler and present a strategy for performing code generation in an incremental fashion that is best suited to generating high-quality code efficiently. We also describe the Operation Binding Lattice, a formal model for incrementally binding the opcodes and register assignments in an EPIC code generator. As we show, this reflects the phase structure of the EPIC code generator. It also defines the structure of the machine-description database, which is queried by the code generator for the information that it needs about the target processor. Lastly, we discuss our implementation of these ideas and techniques in Elcor, our EPIC compiler research infrastructure...|$|E

To broaden the twenty qubit limit of workstation-based simulations {{to the next}} qubit decade we provide a dedicated high memorized Linux cluster with fast Myrinet interconnection network together with a adapted parallel simulator engine. This simulation service supplemented by a collaborative workspace is usable everywhere via web interface and integrates both hardware and software as collaboration and investigation platform for the quantum community.

The beta test version realizes all common one, two and three qubit gates, arbitrary one and two bit gates, orthogonal measurements as well as special gates like Oracle, Modulo funct ion and Quantum Fourier Transformation. The main focus of our project is the simulation of experimentally realizations of quantum algorithms which will make it feasible to understand the differences between real and ideal quantum devices and open the view for new algorithms and applications. That is why the simulator also can work with arbitrary Hamiltonians yielding its unitary transformation, spectrum and eigenvectors. To realize the various simulation tasks we integrate various implementations. The test version is able to simulate small quantum circuits and Hamiltonians exactly, the latter {{through the use of a}} standard diagonalization procedure. Circuits up to thirty qubits can be simulated exactly as well; Hamiltonians of that size, however, have to be approximated according to the Trotter formulae.

Post-transcriptional processes are also likely to make an important contribution to the circadian regulation of output pathways.

40|$|Abstract Discrete gate sizing is a {{critical}} optimization in VLSI circuit design. Given a set of available gate sizes, discrete gate sizing problem asks to assign a size to each gate such that the delay of a combinational circuit is minimized while the cost constraint is satisfied. It {{is one of the}} most studied problems in VLSI computer-aided design. Despite this, all of the existing techniques are heuristics with no performance guarantee. This limits the understanding of the discrete gate sizing problem in theory. This paper designs the first fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the delay driven discrete gate sizing problem. The proposed approximation scheme involves a level based dynamic programming algorithm which handles the specific structures of a discrete gate sizing problem and adopts an efficient oracle query procedure. It can approximate the optimal gate sizing solution within a factor of (1 + ɛ) in O(n 1 +c m 3 c /ɛ c) time for 0 <ɛ< 1 and in O(n 1 +c m 3 c) time for ɛ ≥ 1, where n is the number of gates, m is the maximum number of gate sizes for any gate, and c is the maximum number of gates per level. The FPTAS needs the assumption that c is a constant and thus it is an approximation algorithm for the <b>restricted</b> discrete <b>gate</b> sizing problem...|$|R

We show that all common LOGSPACE-complete problems for P are incr-POLYLOGTIME-complete for P. This suggests that non-redundant problems that seem inherently unparallelizable also seem hard to dynamize. We show that a form of transitive closure is complete under incremental reduction for NLOGSPACE and give similar problems which are incrementally complete for the classes LOGSPACE and non-uniform NC¹. We show that under certain restrictions problems which have efficient dynamic solutions also have efficient parallel solutions.
