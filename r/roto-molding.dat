40|$|AbstractUsing scale {{analysis}} and {{the method of}} perturbations, a theoretical description is obtained for the steady-state non-Newtonian flow on the inner wall of the rotating horizontal cylinder. The Maxwell upper-convective equation is chosen to model the visco-elastic properties of the fluid. In the general case, the derived governing equations can be solved only numerically. However, since the polymeric solutes used in <b>roto-molding</b> and coating technologies exhibit the relatively weak elastic properties, the Deborah number for such flows is rather small (De< 1). Exploiting this fact, the perturbation method is applied for simplification of the model. As a result, the first order non-linear differential equation for {{the thickness of the}} fluid film is derived. An approximate analytical solution of this equation is found. The accuracy of analytical solution is verified by the direct numerical solution of the derived equation. The obtained equation is rather complex and contains several critical points. These points are classified by the analysis of the corresponding autonomous system. The type and location of these critical points are accounted for during numerical solution of the equation. Using the obtained solutions, the criteria which guarantee the stable steady-state flow of the liquid polymer and the uniform final thickness of the coating film are determined. The bounds for the different flow regimes and principal controlling parameters are identified...|$|E
50|$|Rotationally molded (<b>roto-molded)</b> coolers {{have become}} popular in recent years. <b>Roto-molded</b> coolers are {{manufactured}} using {{a process called}} rotational molding, a process by which a heated and softened material is applied into a slowly rotating mold. The mold continues to rotate during the cooling phase, producing a thick and uniform final product. In the case of <b>roto-molded</b> coolers, the heated liquid plastic is applied over {{a thick layer of}} insulation. The resulting product has no seals or imperfections and is much stronger and more durable than traditional coolers. Examples of <b>roto-molded</b> coolers include YETI, ORCA or Grizzly coolers.|$|R

5000|$|Plastic: Royalex is a {{composite}} material, comprising an outer layer of vinyl and hard acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic (ABS) and an inner layer of ABS foam, bonded by heat treatment. As a canoe material, Royalex is lighter, more resistant to UV damage, is more rigid, and has greater structural memory than non-composite plastics such as polyethylene. Royalex canoes are, however, more expensive than aluminium canoes or canoes made from traditionally molded or <b>roto-molded</b> polyethylene hulls. It is heavier, and less suited for high-performance paddling than fiber-reinforced composites, such as fiberglass, kevlar, or graphite. Rotational molding <b>Roto-molded</b> polyethylene is a cheaper alternative to Royalex. Production of Royalex ceased in 2014.|$|R

It was mass-produced by {{a garbage can}} manufacturing company. These virtually indestructible boats revolutionized the sport, and quickly took off in California. Paddlers {{no longer had to}} constantly repair their boats during and after trips. They began {{to be able to use}} rocks as part of the strategy of negotiating difficult rapids. Hard runs became more accessible to less-skilled paddlers.|$|R
50|$|The Mega Man Retro Roto Figure line is {{an action}} figure toyline {{based on the}} {{characters}} from the original or classic Mega Man series. They were first released in 2005 by Jazwares, a toy company based out of Sunrise, Florida. The figures are approximately 6 inches tall (though some vary in height) and are made of super durable <b>roto-molded</b> PVC plastic. Fans of Mega Man and action figure collectors have praised the figures for their immaculate detail and resemblance to the original art work of Mega Man character designer Keiji Inafune.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary traditional-style kayaks {{trace their}} origins {{primarily}} to the native boats of Alaska, northern Canada, and Southwest Greenland. Wooden kayaks and fabric kayaks on wooden frames dominated the market up until the 1950s, when fiberglass boats were first introduced in the US, and inflatable rubberized fabric boats were first introduced in Europe. Rotomolded plastic kayaks first appeared in 1973, and most kayaks today are made from <b>roto-molded</b> polyethylene resins. The development of plastic and rubberized inflatable kayaks arguably initiated the development of freestyle kayaking {{as we see it}} today, since these boats could be made smaller, stronger and more resilient than fiberglass boats.|$|R
5000|$|The {{best known}} use of Royalex {{is for the}} {{manufacture}} of canoe hulls. Royalex is lighter, more resistant to UV damage from sunlight, is more rigid, and has greater structural memory than non-composite plastics used for this purpose, such as polyethylene. It is also quieter, faster, and more user friendly in cold or hot conditions than aluminium, described by canoeist Kent Ford described as [...] "noisy, heavy and hot." [...] Royalex canoes are, however, more expensive than aluminium canoes or canoes made from traditionally molded or <b>roto-molded</b> polyethylene hulls. [...] "Royalex was soft, quiet and slippery on rocks, and not too heavy if you kept the gunwales light,‚Äù according to Kent Ford.|$|R
