5000|$|<b>Radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay buffer (RIPA buffer) is a {{lysis buffer}} used to lyse cells and tissue, for {{radio immunoprecipitation assay}} (RIPA). [...] This buffer is more {{denaturing}} than NP-40 or Triton X-100 lysis buffer because it contains the ionic detergents SDS and sodium deoxycholate as active constituents and is particularly useful for disruption of nuclear membranes {{in the preparation of}} nuclear extracts. The RIPA buffer gives low background but can denature kinases.|$|E
50|$|AGID is {{diagnosed}} with a complete medical history, exam of patients motility and with special blood tests looking for autoantibodies consistent with neurologic autoimmunity. Blood tests included evaluations of immunofluorescence (neuronal nuclear and cytoplasmic antibodies), <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assays (neuronal and muscle plasma membrane cation channel antibodies), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (muscle striational antibodies). A finding, along with medical history, of ganglionic neuronal acetylcholine receptor and N-type voltage-gated calcium channel autoantibodies in the blood stream {{would result in a}} medically acceptable diagnosis of AGID.|$|E
50|$|In 1990 {{a team of}} {{researchers}} led by Wong-Staal studied the effects that the Tat protein within the viral strain HIV-1 would have on the growth of cells found within Kaposi’s Sarcoma lesions commonly found in AIDS patients. The team {{of researchers}} performed tests on a variety of cells that carried the tat protein and observed the rate of cell proliferation in cells infected by HIV-1 and the control, a culture of healthy human endothelial cells. Wong-Staal used a type of cellular analysis known as <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> in order to detect the presence of KS lesions in cells with varying amounts of the tat protein. The results of these tests showed that the amount of tat protein within a cell infected by HIV-1 is directly correlated to the amount of KS lesions a patient may have. These findings were essential in developing new treatments for HIV/AIDS patients who suffer from these dangerous lesions.|$|E
50|$|Antibodies {{directed}} against VGKC were first reported in neuromyotonia. Further studies led to VGKC antibodies being recognized in Morvan’s syndrome and limbic encephalitis as well. It was {{for many years}} erroneously presumed that antibodies detected in a VGKC assay were targeted against the channel itself. But the heterogeneous presentation of patients was difficult to explain. The original assays {{for the detection of}} VGKC antibodies used Iodine-125 labelled dendrotoxin and the relatively mild detergent 2% digitonin on mammalian brain homogenate, and VGKC with complexed proteins was extracted. Co-precipitated proteins would thus also be detected in this assay. It’s now acknowledged that most VGKC antibodies are instead directed towards associated/complexed proteins. In a particular study of 96 patients with VGKC antibodies detected with the <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay, only 3 (3%) had antibodies towards the Kv1 subunit of the VGKC channel, 55 (57%) had antibodies against Leucine-rich, glioma Inactivated 1 (LGI1), 19 had antibodies reacting with Contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR 2), 5 had antibodies against Contactin-2 and 18 (19%) had antibodies with unknown specificity. Of the patients with Contactin-2 antibodies, 4/5 had antibodies against other antigens as well.|$|E
40|$|Antibodies {{to human}} {{papilloma}} virus (HPV) type 16 (HPV- 16) E 6 and E 7 proteins in serum are markers for HPV-associated invasive cervical carcinoma. We compared two assays, a <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay with in vitro-translated HPV- 16 E 6 and E 7 proteins and an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) with E 6 and E 7 synthetic peptides, for their abilities to discriminate serologically between patients with invasive cervical cancer and controls. Among the patients, antibody prevalences were higher by the E 6 <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay (55. 7 %) than by the E 6 peptide ELISA (15. 5 %), but among the controls, they were lower by the <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay (1. 7 %) than by the E 6 peptide ELISA (5 %). For E 7, antibody prevalences among the patients were comparable by the <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay (43 %) and the peptide ELISA (41 %), but among the controls they were higher by the E 7 peptide ELISA (17. 4 %) than by the <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay (4. 1 %). There was good agreement between the E 7 <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay and the E 7 peptide ELISA among patients but not among controls. In tests with representative sera, heat denaturation of the translated proteins resulted in a complete loss of reactivity to the E 6 protein and a marked decrease in reactivity to the E 7 protein. Our study showed that the <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay discriminates better than the peptide ELISA between patients with invasive cervical cancer and controls {{and that this is}} related to the ability of the <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay to detect conformational epitopes...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To examine {{specific}} lymphocyte or neuronal antigens immuno-precipitated by systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) sera. METHOD [...] SLE sera were screened {{for the presence of}} antibodies binding to surface antigens of CD 4 (+) HUT- 78 or SK-N-SH and IMR- 6 neuroblastoma cells using Western blotting or <b>radioimmunoprecipitation.</b> RESULTS [...] IgG eluates from both lymphocytes and neuroblastoma cells recognised a 52 kd band in HUT 78 cell lysates. Eight sera studied further using <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> also demonstrated binding to a 52 kd antigen (4 / 8 on HUT- 78, 8 / 8 on SK-N-SH cells), partially depleted by absorption with viable HUT- 78.

40|$|Twenty-one {{monoclonal}} antibodies reactive with Junin virus structural proteins {{were produced}} and characterized. Using <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> and Western blot assays, 13 {{were found to}} react with the nucleoprotein, seven with the surface glycoprotein and one failed to react, but showed a fluorescent antibody staining pattern consistent with other glycoprotein-specific antibodies. In <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assays, glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies reacted {{not only with the}} 35 K structural glycoprotein, but also with what is presumed to be the glycoprotein precursor. Four of seven glycoprotein-specific antibodies neutralized Junin virus to high titres. Cross-reactivity with other arenaviruses was found to be restricted to nucleoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies and occurred only with New World arenaviruses. Cross-reactivity also shows the Junin virus to be most closely related to Machupo and Tacaribe viruses...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assays {{in which}} iodinated preparations of A/Port Chalmers/ 73 (A/PC/ 73) hemagglutinin {{were used as}} the test antigens and high concentrations of unlabeled A/Hong Kong/ 68 viral protein were used to inhibit the binding of cross-reactive antibodies to quantitate strain-specific antibody responses in postvaccination sera. Strain-specific antibodies comprised 8 to 48 % (mean, 20 %) of the total A/PC/ 73 antigen-binding capacity of the sera tested. Competition <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assays in which disrupted preparations of purified whole virus representative {{of several of the}} H 3 N 2 variants were used indicated that the A/PC/ 73 strain-specific antibody that was present after adsorption of serum by A/Hong Kong/ 68 antigen was capable of reacting with A/England/ 72 and A/Victoria/ 75 hemagglutinins, but generally with lower avidity than with A/PC/ 73 hemagglutinin. A comparison of the A/PC/ 73 antibody titers measured by <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> and hemagglutination inhibition tests before and after adsorption with A/Hong Kong/ 68 whole virus suggested that cross-reactive and strain-specific antibodies were comparable in efficiency of inhibiting viral hemagglutination. These data indicated that vaccines containing later variants within a subtype could induce antihemagglutinin antibodies of restricted specificity, but that these antibodies may not be directed against unique antigenic determinant(s) ...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the {{humoral immune response}} to transforming proteins E 6 and E 7 of human papillomavirus type 16 before and after treatment and during follow-up, consecutive serum samples from 36 cervical cancer patients whose tumours were found to contain human papillomavirus type 16 DNA by use of the polymerase chain reaction were tested using in vitro translated proteins E 6 and E 7 in a <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay and in an E 7 synthetic peptide enzyme immunoassay. Antibody levels against E 6 and E 7 as measured by <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay showed a nearly identical pattern. Seronegative patients remained seronegative throughout treatment and follow-up. Seropositive patients showed either a decrease in antibody level or stable antibody levels during treatment. In contrast to patients without evidence of disease {{at the end of}} the study, the majority of patients with recurrent disease showed increasing antibody levels during the follow-up period. These results indicate that, in patients who are seropositive before treatment antibody levels against E 6 and E 7 of human papillomavirus type 16 after treatment are closely linked to treatment response.

40|$|Sera from (i) {{gnotobiotic}} BALB/c, CD- 1, and CFW {{mice and}} (ii) conventional BALB/c mice {{were evaluated by}} radioimmunoassay, <b>radioimmunoprecipitation,</b> and plaque reduction neutralization, using the Wa, SA- 11, and WC- 3 (bovine) strains of rotavirus as the detecting antigens. The gnotobiotic mice had no antirotavirus antibody detectable by <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> and no neutralizing antibody at a dilution of 1 : 50 by plaque reduction neutralization. All sera from the conventional mice had rotavirus-specific antibodies detected by radioimmunoassay and by <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> at serum dilutions of 1 : 50 and 1 : 10, 000, respectively. The antibodies were directed against viral proteins p 116, p 94, p 88, and p 84 of all three viruses, but had no neutralizing activity against heterologous rotaviruses at a dilution of 1 : 50. Conventional seropositive mice were parenterally immunized with the Wa, SA- 11, or WC- 3 strain of rotavirus. An approximate 100 -fold increase in rotavirus-specific antibodies was detected by radioimmunoassay, and greater than 20 -fold selective neutralization of the immunizing strain of virus was observed. Sera from the mice immunized with Wa virus had antibodies directed against inner and outer capsid proteins of all three rotaviruses. The mouse can be a useful model for studying the immune response to heterologous rotavirus infection; preexisting antibodies presumably directed towards murine rotavirus do not prevent {{the development of a}} type-specific immune response to a nonmurine rotavirus...|$|E
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (MAbs) reactive to the pathogenic amoeba Naegleria fowleri {{were analyzed}} by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence assay, Western blotting (immunoblotting), and <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay (RIPA). Two MAbs (3 A 4 and 5 D 12) showed reactivity by ELISA with all N. fowleri strains tested and no reactivity with the five other Naegleria species, N. lovaniensis, N. gruberi, N. australiensis, N. jadini, and N. andersoni. These MAbs reacted with the three morphological forms of N. fowleri (trophozoites, cysts, and flagellates). The reactivity on Western blots was suppressed by treatment with metaperiodate, suggesting a carbohydrate epitope. Differences in reactivity patterns between trophozoites and cysts observed with <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay might reflect differences in biological properties.

40|$|The binding of two {{monoclonal}} {{antibodies to}} crude and pure preparations of pertussis toxin was examined.

Antibody P 7 B 10 was unreactive in immunoblots and <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> but was able to bind and retain toxin subunits during affinity chromatography. The P 7 B 10 epitope may thus be labile to detergent treatment or radioiodination; or the epitope may form {{as a result of}} subunit association.

40|$|Growth of Legionella pneumophila {{serogroup}} 1 in {{yeast extract}} broth was standardized, and protein profiles of detergent-solubilized cells {{were determined by}} sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Over 30 protein bands were identified, 6 of which were more prominent both in Coomassie brilliant blue-stained profiles and in fluorograms with intrinsically radiolabeled bacteria. These major proteins were 22, 000 dalton (22 K), 24 K, 43 K, 63 K, 76 K, and 78 K. We found that the 24 K and 63 K major proteins were antigenic, as demonstrated both by <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> (RIP) of [35 S]methionine-labeled organisms and by immunoblotting with rabbit hyperimmune sera. In addition, both techniques detected antigens migrating at 58 K, 72 K, 76 K, and 78 K. The major 22 K and 43 K major proteins and antigens migrating at 25. 5 K, 29 K, and 46 K were only detected by <b>radioimmunoprecipitation,</b> whereas antigens of 19 K, 48 K, 53 K, and 68 K were detected only by immunoblotting. Cell-surface localization of the proteins was determined by a modified <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assay designed to react specifically with surface antigens and {{by the use of}} hyperimmune sera that had been extensively preabsorbed with intact cells to deplete the sera of antibodies directed against surface components.

40|$|Mammalian type-C viruses {{contain a}} major {{internal}} polypeptide of about 30, 000 daltons that {{is characterized by}} both intraspecies and interspecies antigenic reactivities. <b>Radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assays were used for measurement of this protein; the assay was based upon interspecies reactivities of the protein. As little as 5 ng of the group-specific antigen of murine leukemia virus can be measured by <b>radioimmunoprecipitation</b> assays, thus providing an approximate 10, 000 -fold increase in sensitivity over the standard immunodiffusion procedure. The type-C viruses that were recently isolated from a woolly monkey and gibbon ape each have an interspecies type-C antigenic reactivity. The primate viruses, however, could be distinguished from the type-C viruses of murine, rat, hamster, and feline origin that were more highly related to each other. The interspecies reactivity of the 30, 000 -dalton polypeptide is an immunological marker of the mammalian type-C viruses, since even with this sensitive assay other mammalian viruses with RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity did not contain the type-C interspecies antigen...|$|E
