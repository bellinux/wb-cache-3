25|$|Machen left {{half his}} {{considerable}} estate to Westminster Seminary in Philadelphia. Giving $10,000 outright to the seminary, Dr. Machen provided {{that half of}} the balance, after certain bequests to his brothers and others were cared for, should be placed in the hands of five trustees to be held for the benefit of Westminster Seminary. Ten per cent of the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> was to go to the Independent Board. The will was drawn in 1935, before the establishing of The Presbyterian Guardian and before the organization of the new Church. The gross estate was estimated at $175,000.|$|E
500|$|Grossmith died at {{his home}} in Folkstone at the age of 64. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, in the London Borough of Brent. In his will, dated 26 October 1908, Grossmith left small bequests to a variety of {{charities}} and persons; 2,000 pounds, artworks and heirlooms to each of his children (except that Lawrence did not receive a cash bequest), his son George receiving also [...] "two silver bowls presented to him by [...] Carte [...] the ivory baton with which he conducted the orchestra on the occasion of his said son's first appearance on the stage" [...] in Haste to the Wedding; and smaller bequests to his children's spouses and his nieces, nephews, grandchildren and some cousins, with the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> shared equally by his children (although the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> was not large).|$|E
500|$|Where a {{beneficiary}} under {{a secret}} trust predeceases the testator, {{his or her}} personal representative will inherit instead, as in Re Gardner. If the gift had been made directly as part of testator's will it would have lapsed and formed part {{of his or her}} <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> by the beneficiary's death, but since he or she inherits {{as a result of a}} separate secret trust that rule does not apply. Where the trustee of a secret trust predeceases the testator, or renounces his trusteeship before the death of the testator, the position of the secret trust in unclear. In the case of a half-secret trust, the trust ought to be good on the basis that [...] "equity will not allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee". Of a fully secret trust, it was indicated by Lord Buckmaster in Blackwell v Blackwell that such a trust might not fail: [...] "the legatee might defeat the whole purpose by renouncing the legacy... I entertain no doubt that the Court, having once admitted the evidence of the trust, would interfere to prevent its defeat." [...] Against this, it has been argued that the arrangement is the result of a personal obligation as thus fails if renounced or if the trustee predeceases the testator.|$|E
5000|$|His wife, Sophia, {{remained}} {{in the city of}} New Brunswick after Littleton's death. When she died on March 6, 1871 at the age of 68, she named Rutgers College as her <b>estate's</b> <b>residuary</b> legatee. [...] Rutgers used the proceeds of this bequest to build Kirkpatrick Chapel in 1873. Today, this chapel is located on the historic Queen's Campus section of Rutgers's College Avenue Campus.|$|R
5|$|When Sophia Astley Kirkpatrick (1802–1871) died on March 6, 1871 {{at the age}} of 68, {{she named}} Rutgers College as her <b>estate's</b> <b>residuary</b> legatee. At that time, Rutgers was a small, private liberal arts college in New Brunswick, New Jersey, {{affiliated}} with the Dutch Reformed faith. Founded in 1766 as Queen’s College, Rutgers is the eighth-oldest institution of higher education established in the United States. It was one of nine colleges founded in the American colonies before the Revolutionary War. Rutgers' website states that this bequest from Sophia Kirkpatrick's will {{was the first time in}} New Jersey legal history that an institution became a direct heir to an estate.|$|R
5000|$|By his will, dated 31 December 1840, Chantrey (who had no children) {{left his}} whole <b>residuary</b> {{personal}} <b>estate</b> after the decease {{or on the}} second marriage of his widow (less certain specified annuities and bequests) in trust {{for the president and}} trustees of the Royal Academy (or in the event of its dissolution to such society as might take its place), the income to be devoted to the encouragement of British painting and sculpture, by [...] "the purchase of works of fine art of the highest merit ... that can be obtained." [...] The funds might be allowed to accumulate for not more than five years; works by British or foreign artists, dead or living, might be acquired, so long as such works were entirely executed within Great Britain, the artists having been in residence there during the execution and completion. The prices to be paid were to be [...] "liberal," [...] and no sympathy for an artist or his family was to influence the selection or the purchase of works, which were to be acquired solely on the ground of intrinsic merit. No commission or orders might be given: the works must be finished before purchase. Conditions were made as to the exhibition of the works, in the confident expectation that the government or the country would provide a suitable gallery for their display; and an annual sum of £300 and £50 was to be paid to the president and the secretary of the Royal Academy respectively, for the discharge of their duties in carrying out the provisions of the will.|$|R
2500|$|After another illness lasting several months, Helen {{died of a}} {{cerebral}} haemorrhage complicated by acute bronchitis in 1913, a week before her 61st birthday. [...] A private funeral was held at Golders Green crematorium. [...] In her will, she left the Savoy Theatre, the opera company and the Savoy Hotel to Rupert, bequests of £5,000 to each of her two brothers and smaller bequests {{to a number of}} friends and colleagues. [...] She left the considerable <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> to her husband. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to operate continuously until 1982.|$|E
2500|$|Rogers {{was the son}} of a {{deceased}} [...] millionaire, Colonel Henry Huddleston Rogers, a former Standard Oil executive. Colonel Rogers made millions in oil, together with the family of John D. Rockefeller, from the resources of the huge estate. The elder Rogers left virtually his entire inheritance to his wife, a daughter, and to a son from his daughter's first marriage. The <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> was left for the wife, daughter, and daughter's son to share equally. Henry H. Rogers III was excluded from the provisions of his father's will through the careful wording of lawyers. He lived on $500,000 annually from a trust fund provided by his father's will. The income was to go to him during his lifetime but would return to the estate when he died.|$|E
50|$|If the {{deceased}} beneficiary {{was intended to}} inherit part {{or all of the}} <b>residuary</b> <b>estate,</b> then that portion of the estate would pass by intestate succession, as though the testator had left no will. This rule {{is referred to as the}} doctrine of no residue of a residue, because the portion of the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> that did not itself pass under the will could not be considered part of the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> at all.|$|E
5000|$|If no such clause is present, {{however, the}} <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> will {{pass to the}} testator's heirs by intestacy.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{modification}} to {{the common}} law of lapse is {{the elimination of the}} [...] "no residue of a residue" [...] rule where multiple beneficiaries are named to inherit the residue. The modern view is that where a beneficiary was intended to inherit part of the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> who predeceases the testator, and that beneficiary is not covered by the anti-lapse statute, then that beneficiary's inheritance will return to the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate,</b> to be inherited by the other beneficiaries to whom the residue has been willed.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{a mother}} leaves her son $50,000, and leaves her son's child (her grandchild) $100,000. She leaves her <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> (i.e., {{whatever}} else {{is left of}} the estate) to her daughter. If the son kills his mother, then under Maryland law, the son's child will inherit the $100,000; however the son's $50,000 (which is also the indirect inheritance of the grandchild through his father), is not available under Maryland law to either the son, or his child. The $50,000 becomes part of the grandmother's <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> and goes to the daughter.|$|E
50|$|At common law, lapse {{occurs when}} the {{beneficiary}} or the devisee under the will predeceases the testator, invalidating the gift. The gift would instead revert to the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> or be granted under the law of intestate succession.|$|E
5000|$|Morse was {{survived by}} his wife Ada, his three children, Edward P. Jr., Roy and Jessie, and eight grandchildren. Apart from Edward P. Jr., all were {{beneficiaries}} of Morse's will, including Jr.'s own children. The primary beneficiary of Morse's will was his daughter Jessie, with $150,000 plus two fifths of the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate,</b> followed by his wife Ada with $80,000 and one part, Jessie's two children with one part of the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> each, and Morse's son Roy with $60,000. In addition to his wife and descendants, Morse's sister Mary and a former employee named Kirsten Jensen received $5,000 each. Morse also gave $500 to St. Clement's Episcopal Church in his native town.|$|E
50|$|General bequests {{or general}} gifts - {{gifts of cash}} amounts - are never adeemed. If the cash in the testator's estate is not {{sufficient}} to satisfy the gift, then other assets in the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> will need to be sold to raise the necessary cash.|$|E
5000|$|.....my said dwelling-house, furniture, {{pictures}} and chattels and {{the income of}} my <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> {{to be used for}} the purpose of providing a retreat for artists and other like persons ... so as to enable them to do or facilitate them in doing creative work.|$|E

50|$|The {{claims made}} by Philip Marshall {{regarding}} his father's {{handling of the}} estate prompted interest in the matter. The New York District Attorney announced indictments on criminal charges against Tony and attorney Francis X. Morrissey Jr., November 27, 2007. The charges stemmed from the district attorney's office and subsequent grand jury investigation into the mishandling of Astor's money, and a questionable signature on the third amendment to her 2002 will, made in March 2004. That amendment called for Astor’s real estate to be sold and the proceeds added to her <b>residuary</b> <b>estate.</b> An earlier amendment, also made in 2004, which designated Marshall as the executor of his mother's estate and left him {{the entirety of the}} <b>residuary</b> <b>estate,</b> was also under investigation.|$|E
50|$|A <b>residuary</b> <b>estate,</b> {{in the law}} of wills, is any {{portion of}} the testator's estate that is not {{specifically}} devised to someone in the will, or any property {{that is part of}} such a specific devise that fails. http://www.nolo.com/definition.cfm/Term/DB9F6C78-01F8-4A95-8B7DC729C0CEE3D4/alpha/R/http://definitions.uslegal.com/w/wills-residuary-estate/ It is also known as a residual estate or simply residue.|$|E
5000|$|A {{residual}} devise is {{one left}} to a devisee after all specific and general devices have been made. For example, James's will might say: [...] "I give all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate {{to my daughter}} Lilly." [...] Lilly would be the residual devisee and entitled to James's <b>residuary</b> <b>estate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Grossmith died at {{his home}} in Folkstone at the age of 64. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, in the London Borough of Brent.

50|$|After {{providing}} {{for his wife}} and daughter, Hall bequeathed his <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> and $2,000 to the Henry George School of Social Science in New York City, to which he had contributed generously. In 1913, an admirer, George Harris, built Bolton Hall in Tujunga, California—a structure that is now on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
50|$|By {{his will}} dated 30 August 1858 John Atkinson gave his <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> upon trust whereby the income would be {{distributed}} to his eleven nephews and nieces for life, and after they were deceased, the capital was to be paid over to the Barbers' Company upon certain charitable trusts. Atkinson died on 8 November 1861.|$|E
50|$|The will may {{identify}} the taker of the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> through a residuary clause or residuary bequest. The person identified {{in such a}} clause is called the residuary taker, residuary beneficiary, or residuary legatee. Such a clause may state that, in the event all other heirs predecease the testator, the estate would pass to a charity (that would, presumably, have remained in existence).|$|E
50|$|His {{father was}} {{a partner in the}} banking firm of Fairlie, Bonner & Co. which was {{subsequently}} renamed Hartwell, Innes, Clerk, Brazier & Co. In William Fairlie's last will and testatment dated 9 October 1823, he bequeathed to his son the sum of £19,000 which was his share of the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate,</b> money that would not be his to spend until reaching the age of 25.|$|E
50|$|Upon George Hunter's {{death in}} 1950, 70 {{percent of the}} Coca-Cola Bottling Company stock went to the Foundation. This led to a probate law precedent-setting lawsuit when family members sued {{regarding}} the tax status of the donation. A 1952 court ruling stated that the Foundation {{did not have to}} pay death duties, which became the responsibility of the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate.</b> The ruling was upheld on appeal.|$|E
50|$|At common law, if the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> {{was divided}} between {{two or more}} {{beneficiaries}}, {{and one of those}} beneficiaries was unable to take, the share that would have gone to that beneficiary would instead pass by intestacy, under the doctrine that there was no residuary of a residuary. The modern rule, however, is that the failure of a residuary gift to one beneficiary causes that beneficiary's share to be divided among the remaining residuary takers.|$|E
5000|$|Steinkopff died in 1906 aged 68 at Lydhurst. He left £1,247,022 in his will. The {{greater part}} of his estate was left in trust to his {{daughter}} Mary Margaret Stewart-Mackenzie, [...] "for such charitable institutions as she may appoint". By a codicil her husband. Sir J. A. F. H. Stewart-Mackenzie, and children were barred from participating in the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate.</b> He also made various bequests to servants and to relatives in Germany.|$|E
5000|$|George {{married in}} 1849 Hannah, {{daughter}} of Thomas Owen, a Baptist minister; they had issue one son and one daughter. His wife predeceased him in 1907. By his will he directed that his <b>residuary</b> <b>estate,</b> about £5000 should be divided equally between the Royal Society of London and the Royal Institution of Great Britain, {{to be applied}} in [...] "assisting original scientific discovery". His daughter, Alice Augusta Gore Fysh, was granted in 1911 a civil list pension of £50.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, Vera Le Cras, the {{daughter}} of Arnold and Tottie Resch, undertook a protracted legal battle in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and later before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, to argue that Edmund Resch Jnr’s bequest of two-thirds of the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> to the Sisters of Charity to build a private hospital (St Vincent's Private Hospital) was not a valid charitable gift, and the estate should therefore have passed to her as next of kin.|$|E
50|$|After his {{retirement}} France lived {{for many years}} at 2 Norfolk Terrace, Westbourne Grove, and died at St Leonards-on-Sea on Oct 6th, 1900. His funeral took place in Chichester Cathedral. By his will this much-respected philanthropist, whose fine motto had been 'May God me guide', left some £25,000 for the public use, and subject to this and some smaller legacies the <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> was left in trust for the Royal Medical Benevolent College at Epsom.He also compiled and edited Preces Veterum, cum Hymnis Coaevis, second edition (I887).|$|E
50|$|Financial {{difficulties}} arose {{when the}} Empire Marketing Board grant ended, {{and at a}} time of economic depression alternative sources of funds were difficult to come by. Although Plunkett had made some provision in his will, it formed part of his <b>residuary</b> <b>estate</b> and was not immediately realisable. The cost of running the Foundation was drastically cut, but so too was its power to continue its development, so self-financing activities were adopted and charges were made for work carried out on behalf of other bodies.|$|E
50|$|If a {{testamentary}} trust fails, the property usually {{will be held}} on resulting trusts for the testator's <b>residuary</b> <b>estate.</b> Some famous English trust law cases were on behalf of the residuary legatees under a will seeking to have {{testamentary trust}}s declared void so as to inherit the trust property. An infamous example is Re Diplock 1941 Ch 253, which resulted in the suicide of one of the trustees who was personally liable to account for trust funds that had been disbursed for what he thought were perfectly valid charitable trusts).|$|E
50|$|After another illness lasting several months, Helen {{died of a}} {{cerebral}} haemorrhage complicated by acute bronchitis in 1913, a week before her 61st birthday.

50|$|Miss Helen Alice Dorothy Barlow, the {{testatrix}} {{had a large}} {{collection of}} pictures. She specifically bequeathed some. For the remainder, she declared them to be held by her executor on trust to sell them, but that her ‘family and friends’ could buy them first at 1970 valuations or at the probate value, whichever was lower. The proceeds {{would go to the}} <b>residuary</b> <b>estate.</b> The executors asked the court whether the direction about family and friends was void, given its uncertainty, and if it was valid, who the family and friends were.|$|E
