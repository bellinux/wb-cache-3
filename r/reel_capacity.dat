50|$|<b>Reel</b> <b>capacity</b> is {{affected}} by both the reel diameter and the reel hub diameter. The standard ten and a half inch reel has approximately twice {{the capacity of the}} seven inch reel, which in turn has twice the capacity of the five inch. Some (not all) reels described as three inches are in fact three and a quarter inches in diameter, in order to have half the capacity of a five-inch reel.|$|E
5000|$|The typical {{professional}} {{audio tape}} recorder {{of the early}} 1950s used [...] wide tape on [...] <b>reels,</b> with a <b>capacity</b> of [...] Typical speeds were initially [...] yielding 30 minutes' recording time on a [...] reel. [...] {{was used for the}} highest quality work. Domestic and portable recorders used [...] inch reels (or spools). Early professional machines used single-sided spools but double-sided spools soon became popular (particularly for domestic use). Tape spools were usually made from transparent plastic but metal spools were also used.|$|R
40|$|The work {{deals with}} {{construction}} of electrical cable <b>reel</b> with lifting <b>capacity</b> 800 kg, {{height of lift}} 20 m and lift speed 10 m/min. In the work is solved design of cable, cable drum and its placing in frame, strenght calculations of the drum and its shafts, check calculations of bearings and keys, choice of suitable drive and its connection to the drum and fastening the whole to the base. Between parts of the work belong component drawings, parts list and assembly dravings with the main measurements and assembly diagram...|$|R
50|$|Fly line is {{typically}} {{attached to a}} length of braided or gelspun line wound on the fly reel known as backing. The length and breaking strength of the backing required depends on the overall line <b>capacity</b> of the <b>reel</b> {{and the type of}} fish being sought. Backing may be as short as a few yards up to hundreds of yards if the <b>reel</b> has the <b>capacity.</b> Backing can serve two purposes. One is to create a larger diameter spooling surface that allows the fly line to fill the entire fly reel. The other is to provide additional line for fighting heavy or hard fighting fish. A fast running or hard fighting fish may take line from the reel and get into the backing.|$|R
