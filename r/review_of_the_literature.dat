5|$|In a 2003 <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature,</b> Rowan et al. {{proposed}} {{one model}} for how LTP might be affected in AD. AD appears to result, {{at least in}} part, from misprocessing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The result of this abnormal processing is the accumulation of fragments of this protein, called amyloid β (Aβ). Aβ exists in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Misprocessing of APP results in the accumulation of soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan's hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and {{may lead to the}} cognitive decline seen early in AD.|$|E
