40|$|Bacterial {{communities}} of different <b>respiratory</b> <b>types</b> were isolated from a marine sediment in a multiple chemostat system {{in an attempt}} to obtain bacterial cultures representative of the sediment. The fatty acid distribution of a mixed culture of sulphate-reducing bacteria isolated from this system showed a good correlation with the lipid distribution of the zone of maximum sulphate-reduction activity within the sediment. Both distributions had significant concentrations of C 14 : 0, iso and anteiso C 15 : 0, C 16 : 0, C 16 : 1 ω 7 and C 18 : 1 ω 7. This was in contrast to the lipid profile of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans obtained by batch enrichment, which was dominated by iso C 17 : 1 ω 7 fatty acids and correlated poorly with the sediment. The bacterial community cultured from the sediment was further differentiated according to <b>respiratory</b> <b>types</b> (aerobic, facultative aerobic and facultative anaerobic) by growth in a chemostat under defined conditions. The fatty acid distributions of these communities were sufficiently different to enable the various <b>respiratory</b> <b>types</b> to be recognized by their particular fatty acid composition. Cyclopropyl fatty acids (▿ 17 and ▿ 19) were present in significant levels only in the aerobic bacteria, while the facultative aerobes had significantly higher C 18 : 1 ω 7 than the other cultures and the facultative anaerobic community was the only culture to have significant amounts of C 12 : 0. The fatty acid distribution of Loch Eil sediment over the range C 12 - 19 seemed to be predominantly of bacterial origin and were relatively abundant to a depth of 6 cm. The concentration of cyclopropyl fatty acids was highest in the oxidized surface sediments and decreased with depth as anaerobic conditions began to dominate, indicating that these fatty acids may only be indicative of aerobic sedimentary bacteria. In contrast to the fatty acids characteristic of bacteria, those fatty acids in the range C 20 - 30 attributed to a terrestrial input were found in relatively constant concentrations over the whole 0 – 12 cm depth profile...|$|R

40|$|Colicins E 1 and K {{inhibited}} a {{whole series}} of energy-dependent reactions in Escherichia coli cells, including motility, biosynthesis of nucleic acids, proteins and polysaccharides, and the conversion of ornithine to citrulline. Respiration was only partially affected, and substrates such as glucose continued to be catabolized through the normal pathways, albeit with reduced CO 2 production. The soluble products of aerobic glucose catabolism by colicin-treated cells were analyzed. Pyruvate replaced acetate as the major excreted product, and the following intermediates of glycolysis were excreted in significant amounts: glucose- 6 -phosphate, fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and 3 -phosphoglycerate. Anaerobically growing cells manifested a somewhat enhanced tolerance to the colicins. This protection by anaerobiosis appeared to depend on the exclusion of oxygen more than on the extent of fermentative catabolism versus catabolism of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>type.</b> These results are interpreted in terms of possible functions of colicin in lowering the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content of the cells {{and in terms of the}} role of lowered ATP levels in inhibiting many of the energy-requiring reactions...|$|E

40|$|The {{histology}} and mitotic {{indices of}} rat laryngeal epithelia were investigated.

Strain Y- 104 T has the following chemotaxonomic characteristics: it contains menaquinone MK- 8 (H 4), its DNA G+C content is 67. 5 mol%, and it contains meso-diaminopimelic acid. No previously described high-G+ C-content gram-positive coccus con-tains both MK- 8 (H 4) as a major quinone and meso-diaminopimelic acid in its cell wall. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16 s rRNA sequences showed that strain Y- 104 T represents a line of descent distinct from those of previously described species of high-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria and {{that members of the}} genus Frankiu are the nearest neighbors.

Methods: A retrospective, observational {{study was conducted}} between January 2009 and December 2012 and included 4361 patients with sudden cardiopulmonary arrest. Resuscitation forms were reviewed. Demographic data, resuscitation characteristics, and survival outcomes were recorded. Results: The mean ± standard deviation age of arrested patient was 40 ± 31 years. The immediate survival rate was 64 %, 43 % at 24 h, and 30 % at discharge.

40|$|Among the {{products}} that are expressed when Mycobacterium tuberculosis undergoes hypoxic shiftdown to nonreplicating persistence (NRP) is the alpha-crystallin chaperone protein homologue (Acr). This expression coincides with the previously reported appearance of a <b>respiratory</b> <b>type</b> of nitrate reductase activity, the increase in glycine dehydrogenase activity, {{and the production of}} a unique antigen, URB- 1. In a timed sampling study, using a slowly stirred oxygen depletion culture model, we have demonstrated that the hspX mRNA that codes for Acr protein as well as the protein itself is induced just as the bacilli enter the microaerophilic NRP stage 1 (NRP- 1). In contrast to the induction observed for hspX mRNA, levels of 16 S rRNA, fbpB mRNA (encoding the 85 B alpha antigen), and aroB mRNA (encoding dehydroquinate synthase) demonstrate relatively small to no change upon entering NRP- 1. Acr protein was shown to be identical to URB- 1 by Western analysis with anti-URB- 1 antibody. The fact that antibody to Acr is found in a high percentage of tuberculosis patients suggests that the hypoxic shiftdown of tubercle bacilli to the NRP state that occurs in vitro, resulting in production of the alpha-crystallin protein, occurs in vivo as well. Simultaneous abrupt increases in hspX mRNA and Acr protein suggest that Acr protein expression is controlled at the level of transcription...|$|E

A much more acute myxomatosis syndrome was produced in conventional rabbits than that reproduced previously in SPF animals. However, the main clinical signs were of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>type.</b> The MV strains MYX 254 / 95 and 801 appeared very virulent, killing all the inoculated animals. The strains MYX 217 / 95, MYX 555 / 94 and Saint Benoist were somewhat attenuated, killing only seven, six and six rabbits, respectively. Extensive lung lesions due to supervening bacterial infections were observed in 36 of the 39 rabbits that died. Lethality was found to be a better estimate of virulence than mean survival time. By 98 days after viral inoculation, all the surviving animals had completely recovered. At that time, they were immunosuppressed by treatment with adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) for 10 days to determine whether they still harboured the virus. After the ACTH treatment, eight of the 11 surviving rabbits showed clinical signs that resembled amyxomatous myxomatosis.
