40|$|This paper investigates {{individual}} fund {{returns in}} the private equity industry using a unique data set collected by Venture Economics. We find a large degree of heterogeneity among fund returns. Those returns persist strongly across funds by private equity firms. The returns also improve with firm experience. Better performing funds {{are more likely to}} raise follow-on funds and raise larger funds than more poorly performing firms. This relationship is concave so that top performing funds grow more slowly than the market average. Finally, we find that funds that are <b>raised</b> in <b>boom</b> times (and firms that are started in boom times) are less likely to raise a follow-on fund, suggesting that these funds perform worse. Several of these results differ substantially from those for mutual funds...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} the {{performance}} of Nordic private equity buyout and venture funds between 2005 to 2016 using a dataset from Preqin. We have defined the Nordic to include Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. By looking at fund characteristics such as fund types, cycles, sequence number, location, and size, and measured it on IRR 1, TVPI and size, we have discovered the characteristics that drive private equity in the Nordic. Previous research indicates that our dataset is of high quality and shows a real picture of the private equity market. However, a pitfall in this work is that our sample size of venture funds only consists of seven funds. This {{will have an impact}} on the statistical results and makes it difficult to conclude anything about venture fund performance. Our analysis reveal that buyout funds outperform venture funds in general, which is in line with existing work and of no surprise given our modern focus. Looking at cycles, we find that funds raised in bust periods significantly outperform funds that are <b>raised</b> in <b>boom</b> periods. Specifically, buyout funds raised in bust periods perform better than buyout funds <b>raised</b> in <b>boom</b> periods. Also, we report that small buyout funds are better than medium buyout funds, which gives evidence of a negative correlation between performance and size. Studying the relation between sequence number and performance, we find that funds with sequence number 1 outperform funds with sequence number 0, and that sequence number 3 is better than 1. This means that success increase the chances of creating a follow-on fund. These two findings are only significant when we use TVPI, and not IRR. Last, we find that buyout funds are larger than venture funds in general, and that funds located in Sweden are the largest in the Nordic region. We believe our findings sets the ground for further research on many things. Specially, it would be interesting to relate Nordic PE performance to a relevant benchmark. Also, we think a closer look on the GPs ability to create abnormal return will be of high interest. Last, we suggest that it could be relevant to include real estate funds in the study of Nordic PE because it is such a major part of the Nordic economy...|$|R

30|$|The {{small impact}} of {{employment}} {{opportunities in the}} construction sector (or low skill occupations in general), which may surprise the reader, can {{be due to the}} fact that our sample period (1991 - 1999) does not cover the core of the boom of the construction sector. In fact it is quite likely that the boom of the construction sector has stronger effect after year 2000, when the evolution of the Spanish construction sector started to clearly diverge from other European countries. This is line with the research by Aparicio (2010) who finds that the improvement in the labour market prospects of low educated workers motivated by the increases in employment and wages in the construction sector during the recent housing <b>boom</b> <b>raised</b> men’s propensity to dropout of high-school, relative to women.|$|R

2500|$|Very {{early in}} the Pacific War, a scheme was {{proposed}} to fit Lightnings with floats {{to allow them to}} make long-range ferry flights. The floats would be removed before the aircraft went into combat. There were concerns that saltwater spray would corrode the tailplane, and so in March 1942, P-38E 41-1986 was modified with a tailplane <b>raised</b> some , <b>booms</b> lengthened by two feet and a rearward-facing second seat added for an observer to monitor the effectiveness of the new arrangement. A second version was crafted on the same airframe with the twin booms given greater sideplane area to augment the vertical rudders. This arrangement was removed and a final third version was fabricated that had the booms returned to normal length but the tail raised [...] All three tail modifications were designed by George H. [...] "Bert" [...] Estabrook. The final version was used for a quick series of dive tests on 7 December 1942 in which Milo Burcham performed the test maneuvers and Kelly Johnson observed from the rear seat. Johnson concluded that the raised floatplane tail gave no advantage in solving the problem of compressibility. At no time was this P-38E testbed airframe actually fitted with floats, and the idea was quickly abandoned as the U.S. Navy proved to have enough sealift capacity to keep up with P-38 deliveries to the South Pacific.|$|R

The two massive military installations were probably responsible for the town's rapid growth in the 1940s. The population grew from 1,111 in 1940, then to 2,688 in 1950. In 1980, it reached 4,628. Although an International Paper mill, the Barry Telford state prison and a few smaller factories provided some industrial base for the town, New Boston depends heavily on the two military installations for its continued prosperity. The town had 5,057 residents in 1990 and 4,550 residents in 2010.|$|R
40|$|While {{there is}} much {{evidence}} to support the resource curse hypothesis for resource-abundant countries, some studies have found that oil <b>booms</b> <b>raise</b> the economic growth of oil-exporting countries. This paper examines the issue of the existence of the threshold effects in the relationship between oil revenues and output growth in oil-exporting countries, applying panel regressions. The empirical results strongly suggest the existence of a threshold beyond which oil revenues growth exerts a negative effect on output. The results indicate that the threshold of growth rate of oil revenues above which oil revenues significantly slows growth is around 18 - 19 % for oil-exporting countries. In contrast, linear estimation without any allowance for threshold effects would misleadingly imply that an increase in the oil revenues increase the economic growth rate. Failure to account for nonlinearities conceal the resource curse in these countries particularly during extreme oil booms as suggested in previous studies.

A trolling line is a fishing line with natural or artificial baited hooks trailed by a vessel near the surface or at a certain depth. Several lines can be towed {{at the same time}} using outriggers to keep the lines apart. The lines can be hauled in manually or by small winches. A length of rubber is often included in each line as a shock absorber. The trolling line is towed at a speed depending on the target species, from 2.3 knots up to at least 7 knots. Trollers range from small open boats to large refrigerated vessels 30 metres long. In many tropical artisanal fisheries, trolling is done with sailing canoes with outriggers for stability. With properly designed vessels, trolling is an economical and efficient way of catching tuna, mackerel and other pelagic fish swimming close to the surface.

40|$|Not to be quoted without permission. Comments welcome. A {{model is}} {{proposed}} to analyze how targeted public spending {{for the poor}} is affected by booms and bust. A Government {{is said to be}} pro-poor but also short-sighted if it helps the poor by increasing targeted and social spending fatser than economic growth during booms. The reason why despite a pro-poor bias, this is characterized as short-sighted behavior, is that rapidly <b>raising</b> spending during <b>booms</b> does not allow the stocking up of resources for helping the poor during recessions. If a Government is pro-poor and short-sighted, the elasticity of targeted or social public spending to growth will be positive and larger than one during booms, and smaller than one during recessions. If the Government is not pro-poor, the elasticity will always be smaller than or equal to one. The prediction of an asymetry between booms and busts in the elasticity to growth of targeted and socila public spending for the poor is tested with panel data on public expenditures for seven Latin American countries. The results suggest that Governments are indeed pro-poor, or at least pro-social, and also short-sighted...|$|R
30|$|According to the World Bank’s estimation, in 2013, {{remittances}} {{to developing}} countries were expected to reach $ 414 billion and over $ 550 billion worldwide (World Bank 2013). In some countries, migrants’ remittances represent more than 20 % of GDP (for example, Tajikistan and Haiti). They have been rising steadily {{for many years in}} developing countries, to become as important as direct investment flows and much higher than the amount of official development assistance. These flows have the advantage of being more stable than other forms of external funding and provide support to remittance-recipient households and communities hit by external shocks. As remittance inflows are a large and stable source of foreign currency, they behave very differently from foreign private capital flows, which often move pro-cyclically, thus <b>raising</b> incomes during <b>booms</b> and depressing them during downturns (Ratha 2013). If remittances are such a big chunk of the receiving country’s budget, and if they are resilient throughout the business cycle, {{it is important to understand}} the motives of the individual migrants who remit. While this is a true statement, on average, for many countries, we seek to examine whether the theoretical predictions hold for Morocco.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{asks whether}} bonanzas (surges) in net capital inflows {{increase}} {{the probability of}} banking crises and whether this is necessarily through a lending boom mechanism. A fixed effects regression analysis indicates that a baseline bonanza, identified as a surge of one standard deviation from trend, increases {{the odds of a}} banking crisis by three times, {{even in the absence of}} a lending boom. Thus, a bonanza raises the likelihood of a crisis from an unconditional probability of 4. 4 percent to 12 percent. Larger windfalls of capital (two-s. d. bonanzas) increase the odds of a crisis by eight times. The joint occurrence of a bonanza and a lending <b>boom</b> <b>raises</b> these odds even more. Decomposing flows into FDI, portfolio-equity and debt indicates that bonanzas in all flows increase the probability of crises when the windfall takes place jointly with a lending boom. Thus, windfalls in all types of flows exacerbate the deleterious effects of credit. However, surges in portfolio-equity flows seem to have an independent effect, even in the absence of a lending boom. Furthermore, emerging economies exhibit greater odds of crises after a windfall of capital. ...|$|R

My aim is to examine whether the new value chain drivers, China and India, are characterised by distinctive value chain governance patterns and whether this impact on the opportunities and constraints for the localisation and development of a mining supply industry. I also analyse the socio-economic context in which these dynamics are embedded to identify historical trajectories and institutional determinants. Zambia represents an appropriate case-study given {{the central role of}} the copper sector in the country's economy and the heterogeneity of the copper industry ownership structure. My findings are based on 77 interviews with European, Canadian, Chinese and South African mining companies, local supply firms, and private and public sector representatives. In addition, archive material was instrumental in contextualising my research questions within post-structural adjustment programme trajectories in the Copperbelt.

40|$|Recovery from a {{recession}} {{triggered by a}} financial crisis is greatly influenced by the government’s fiscal position. A financial crisis puts considerable stress on the government’s budget, sometimes triggering attacks on public debt. Historical analysis shows that a private credit <b>boom</b> <b>raises</b> {{the odds of a}} financial crisis. Entering such a crisis with a swollen public debt may limit the government’s ability to respond and can result in a considerably slower recovery. In financial crises, steep declines in output worsen the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product (GDP) even if the nominal amount of debt remains unchanged. Progressive tax systems cause government revenues to decline at a faster rate than output. Meanwhile, other automatic stabilizers, such as unemployment insurance programs, quickly swell public expenditures. The public sector often assumes private-sector debts to prevent a domino effect of defaults from toppling the financial system. Programs to stimulate the economy put further stress on public finances. As budget deficits balloon, deep economic downturns resulting from a private credit crunch often turn into sovereign debt crises. This Economic Letter examines the interplay between private credit and public debt in financial crises in 17 advanced economies over the past 150 years. Although high levels of public debt seldom trigge...|$|R
50|$|There were, however, several {{drawbacks}} to {{the construction}} at Itaipú. The prosperity associated with the major <b>boom</b> <b>raised</b> expectations for long-term growth. An economic downturn in the early 1980s caused discontent, which in turn led to demands for reform. Many Paraguayans, no longer content to eke out a living on a few hectares, {{had to leave the}} country to look for work. In the early 1980s, some observers estimated that up to 60 percent of Paraguayans were living outside the country. Even those people who were willing to farm a small patch of ground faced a new threat. Itaipú had prompted a tidal wave of Brazilian migration in the eastern border region of Paraguay. By the mid-1980s, observers estimated there were between 300,000 and 350,000 Brazilians in the eastern border region. With Portuguese the dominant language in the areas of heavy Brazilian migration and Brazilian currency circulating as legal tender, the area became closely integrated with Brazil. Further, most of Paraguay's increased wealth wound {{up in the hands of}} wealthy supporters of the regime. Landowners faced no meaningful land reform, the regime's control of labor organizers aided businessmen, foreign investors benefited from tax exemptions, and foreign creditors experienced a bonanza from heavy Paraguayan borrowing. Although the poorest Paraguayans were somewhat better off in 1982 than they were in the 1960s, they were worse off relative to other sectors of the population.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis research were two-fold: (1) to evaluate performance and improvement of basic construction equipment operating skills acquired through a virtual training system, and (2) to analyze transfer of these skills between two slightly different control configurations. These objectives were achieved by {{conducting research on}} a Hydraulic Excavator Personal Simulator. This simulator features two different control configurations: the hydraulic excavator and the backhoe loader control configurations. The configurations differ in that functions assigned to a right joystick (e. g. stick) and those assigned to a left joystick (e. g. boom) for one configuration are switched for the other. ^ Sixty participants were equally divided into four conditions which consisted of a practice and a transfer session. Two groups performed both transfer and practice sessions using the same control configuration (either the hydraulic excavator or the backhoe loader). The other two groups practiced with one control configuration (either the hydraulic excavator or the backhoe loader) and switched to the alternative control configuration (either the backhoe loader or the hydraulic excavator) to perform the transfer session. In each session, participants performed 50 trials {{in which they were}} to complete various simple tasks, such as <b>raising</b> the <b>boom.</b> ^ The study showed that the simulator can be a valuable tool for learning basic construction equipment operating skills. Time to complete the task decreased across trials in the first session for both the hydraulic excavator and the backhoe loader control configurations, indicating skill acquisition and improvement in performance. Additionally, skill transfer was observed between the two different control configurations, with a cost of switching control configurations in the transfer session evident mainly in the first couple of trials. However, groups who practiced with the hydraulic excavator control configuration showed better transfer performance than those who practiced with the backhoe loader control configuration. Although the switch in control configuration mostly affected performance of the functions that switched hands, it had a small cost on performance of the other functions. The results provided sufficient evidence to conclude that the switch in control configuration affected transfer session performance in general, even though the costs were not large. ...|$|R

The main conclusion is that the load levels are highly dependent on the feedpositioning. For example, the load levels in the <b>boom</b> <b>raising</b> cylinder can increaseseven times, if the rig is operated with the most unfavorable positioning compared tothe recommended. It could also be concluded that not only one positioning isextreme in terms of loads; it depends on which part of the boom system is beingobserved.

The crises are studied by literature and using Finnish, Swedish and US data. The data is used to investigate how some phenomena of the theories and the crises, in question, appear in the data of the countries, in question. The studies in the original papers of the theories are not repeated. Based on the studies of this thesis {{it seems that the}} Money View, as Friedman and Schwartz (1963 a) it describe, may have had a role in the United States {{in the days of the}} Great Depression, in 1930 s, but may not have been exactly in the same role, in 2000 s, during the Great Recession. The evidence of the Money View is not equally clear, related to the Finland and Sweden, during the Great Depression but money stocks have, at least, <b>raised</b> during the <b>boom</b> and declined after that in the time of the Great Recession in Finland and Sweden.

However, based on this thesis, it cannot be exactly proved to be the main reason for the crises, in question, in Finland, Sweden and the United States. Yet, it is not the main purpose of this thesis to prove the theories as a cause of the crises but investigate how the phenomena of the theories appear in the data of the each country, in question...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} {{are likely to}} impose some restrictions on {{the next generation of}} supersonic commercial transport. There is a global concern over the effects of engine emissions on the ozone layer which protects life on Earth from ultraviolet radiation. There is also some concern over community noise. The High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) must meet at least the current subsonic noise certification standards to be compatible with the future subsonic fleet. Concerns over sonic boom represent another environmental and marketing challenge to the HSCT program. The most attractive feature of the supersonic transport is speed, which offers the traveling public significant time-savings on long range routes. The sonic boom issue represents a major environmental and economic challenge as well. Supersonic operation overland produces the most desirable economic results. However, unacceptable overland sonic <b>boom</b> <b>raise</b> levels may force HSCT to use subsonic speeds overland. These environmental and economic challenges are likely to impose some restrictions on supersonic operation, thus introducing major changes to existing route structures and future supersonic network composition. The current subsonic route structure may have to be altered for supersonic transports to avoid sensitive areas in the stratosphere or to minimize overland flight tracks. It is important to examine the alternative route structure and the impact of these restrictions on the economic viability of the overall supersonic operation. Future market potential for HSCT fleets must be large enough to enable engine and airframe manufacturers to build the plane at a cost that provides them with an attractive return on investment and to sell it at a price that allows the airlines to operate with a reasonable margin of profit. Subsonic overland operation of a supersonic aircraft hinders its economic viability. Ways to increase the market potential of supersonic operation are described...|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the telehandler is also its biggest limitation: as the <b>boom</b> extends or <b>raises</b> while bearing a load, it acts as a lever and causes the vehicle to become increasingly unstable, despite counterweights in the rear. This means that the lifting capacity quickly decreases as the working radius (distance between {{the front of the}} wheels and the centre of the load) increases. When used as a loader the single boom (rather than twin arms) is very highly loaded and even with careful design is a weakness. A vehicle with a 5,000 lb (2.2ton) capacity with the boom retracted may be able to safely lift as little as 400 lb (225 kg) with it fully extended at a low boom angle. The same machine with a 5,000 lb lift capacity with the boom retracted may be able to support as much as 10,000 lb (5ton) with the <b>boom</b> <b>raised</b> to 70°. The operator is equipped with a load chart which helps him determine whether a given task is possible, taking into account weight, boom angle and height. Failing this, most telehandlers now utilize a computer which uses sensors to monitor the vehicle, and will warn the operator and/or cut off further control input if the limits of the vehicle are exceeded, the latter being a legal requirement in Europe controlled by EN15000. Machines can also be equipped with front stabilizers which extend the lifting capability of the equipment while stationary, as well machines with are fully stabilised with rotary joint between upper and lower frames, which can be called mobile cranes although they can typically still use a bucket, and are also often referred to as 'Roto' machines. They are a hybrid between a Telehandler and small crane.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the {{crayfish}} boom on the Chatham Islands (which occurred between 1966 and 1969) cannot be studied in isolation {{in order to understand}} its effects upon the islanders. Rather, it must be placed in the wider context of relations between the Chatham Islands and New Zealand. To this end, it analyses the social history of fishing from 1910 to 1975, identifying a number of themes {{in the development of the}} Chathams fishing industry that resurfaced in the crayfish boom. Two recurring complaints were that the government repeatedly ignored requests to improve the Islands infrastructure and implement conservation measures. It suggests that the fishermen shared many of the characteristics of a "tight working class" group (as opposed to a upper class capitalist group) and that this may have influenced the perceptions of government officials towards the islanders, particularly during World War Two. Class issues and perceptions of continuing neglect are put forward as underlying factors in the ongoing tensions between 'insiders' (those who lived on the island) and 'outsiders' (those who came from outside the island, particularly fishermen and government officials). These tensions were particularly evident in disputes about employing Italian fishermen in the 1950 s and clashes between locals and 'outsider' fishermen during the crayfish boom. The thesis demonstrates that the crayfish <b>boom</b> <b>raised</b> serious issues including: repeated (yet unheeded) calls for conservation measures, pollution caused by eviscerating crayfish at sea, and the social issues arising from inadequate infrastructure, piracy, violence and marine safety. It demonstrates that failed conservation measures coincided with conservation debates in the 1972 New Zealand election, the same year in which the long-awaited Economic Survey of the Chathams was conducted. The change of government that year led to hopes that the social and environmental issues raised during the crayfish boom would finally be addressed. Although some progress was made, it is argued that many issues remained unresolved. At a wider level, the thesis investigates the relationship between the Chatham Islanders and the government of New Zealand. It demonstrates that, despite government actions, islanders' perceptions of themselves as being geographically, economically and politically marginalised endured...|$|R
40|$|A look at {{the data}} reveals that in OECD countries, {{economic}} fluctuations exhibit a high degree of synchronization. In 1965 - 90, cross-country contemporaneous GDP growth correlations averaged 45 percent. This suggests that a central element of any theory of economic fluctuations should be an explanation of how economic disturbances are transmittedacross countries. But the large body of recent research that emphasizes productivity shocks as the source of fluctuations has been unsuccessful in this regard. The reason, the authors argue, is that these models have not properly addressed the role that commodity trade plays in economic fluctuations. The authors develop a stylized model of commodity trade and economic fluctuations that shows how economic disturbances are positively transmitted internationally, generating the high degree of synchronization in GDP growth rates of OECD countries from 1965 - 90. The positive transmission mechanism is simple: international booms increase the prices of labor-intensive commodities, raising domestic wages and stimulating employment and output at home. This is the"wage effect. "Empirically, this wage effect seems to be large enough to dominate the"interest rate effect"- that international booms also increase world interest rates, induce agents to invest abroad, reducing the domestic capital stock and output. While smaller than the wage effect, the negative transmission by way of the interest rate effect generates predictions that are consistent with existing evidence on current account fluctuations in the OECD. In particular, the model correctly predicts that capital should flow into those countries that experience a boom (relative {{to the rest of the}} world), producing current account deficits. The 1980 s and early 1990 s have brough about rapid financial liberalization. To analyze the implications for the transmission mechanism, the authors also present a model of trade and fluctuations in which agents in some countries are allowed to trade financial assets across borders. This model yields the counterintuitive prediction that the current process of financial integration should lead to a lower degree of synchronization of economic fluctuations. While the wage and interest rate effects still operate in the second model, financial integration creates an additional transmission channel: the"risk-sharing effect. "Since the domestic economy shares in the good times experienced in the rest of the world through financial risk-sharing agreements, international <b>booms</b> <b>raise</b> income at home and, provided leisure is a normal good, discourage employment and reduce output. This is a mechanism of negative transmission and reduces the predicted cross-country GDP growth correlations. Although theoretically interesting, evidence from the U. S. states suggests that this risk-sharing effect is small relative to the wage effect.

40|$|Owing {{to their}} unique physical, chemical, and {{mechanical}} properties, nanoparticles (NPs) have been used, or are being evaluated for use, in many fields (e. g., personal care and cosmetics, pharmaceutical, energy, electronics, food and textile). However, concerns regarding {{the environmental and}} biological implications of NPs are <b>raised</b> alongside the <b>booming</b> nanotechnology industry. Numerous studies on the biological effect of NPs {{have been done in}} the last decade, and many mechanisms have been proposed. In brief, mechanisms underlying the adverse biological effect caused by NPs can be summarized as: (i) indirect adverse effect induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NPs, (ii) indirect adverse effect induced by released toxic ions, and (iii) adverse effect induced by direct interactions of NPs with biological systems. Up to now, most efforts have been focused on the first two mechanisms. In contrast, adverse biological effects induced by direct nano-bio interactions are the least researched. This is largely because of the complexity and lack of suitable techniques for characterizing the nano-bio interface. This dissertation aims at advancing our understanding of the nano-bio interactions leading to the adverse biological effect of NPs. Specifically, it is comprised of three parts. Firstly, because the aggregation of NPs alters particle size and other physicochemical properties of NPs, the property of NPs reaching and interacting with biological cells is very likely different from that of what we feed initially. Consequently, as the first step and an essential prerequisite for understanding the biological effect of NPs, NP aggregation is investigated and models are developed for predicting the stability and the extent of aggregation of NPs. Secondly, interactions between NPs and cell membrane are studied with paramecium as the model cell. Due to the lack of cell wall, the susceptible cell membrane of paramecium is directly exposed to NPs in the medium. The extent and strength of direct nano-cell membrane interaction is evaluated and quantified by calculating the interfacial force/interaction between NPs and cell membrane. A correlation is further established between the nano-cell membrane interaction and the lethal acute toxicity of NPs. We find NPs that have strong association or interaction with the cell membrane tend to induce strong lethal effects. Lastly, we demonstrate systematic experimental approaches based on atomic force microscope (AFM), which allows us to characterize nano-bio interfaces on the single NP and single-molecular level, coupled with modeling approaches to probe the nano-DNA interaction. Using quantum dots (QDs) as a model NP, we have examined, with the novel application of AFM, the NP-to-DNA binding characteristics including binding mechanism, binding kinetics, binding isotherm, and binding specificity. We have further assessed the binding affinity of NPs for DNA by calculating their interaction energy {{on the basis of the}} DLVO models. The modeling results of binding affinity are validated by the NP-to-DNA binding images acquired by AFM. The investigation of the relationship between the binding affinity of twelve NPs for DNA with their inhibition effects on DNA replication suggests that strong nano-DNA interactions result in strong adverse genetic effects of NPs. In summary, this dissertation has furthered our understanding of direct nano-bio interactions and their role in the biological effect of NPs. Furthermore, the models developed in this dissertation lay the basis for building an “ultimate” predictive model of biological effects of NPs that takes into account multiple mechanisms and their interactions, which would save a lot of testing costs and time in evaluating the risk of NPs.

40|$|The {{panoramic}} camera (PanCam) imaging experiment {{is designed to}} obtain high-resolution multispectral stereoscopic panoramic images {{from each of the}} four Mars NetLander 2005 sites. The main scientific objectives to be addressed by the PanCam experiment are (1) to locate the landing sites and support the NetLander network sciences, (2) to geologically investigate and map the landing sites, and (3) to study the properties of the atmosphere and of variable phenomena. To place in situ measurements at a landing site into a proper regional context, it is necessary to determine the lander orientation on ground and to exactly locate the position of the landing site with respect to the available cartographic database. This is not possible by tracking alone {{due to the lack of}} on-ground orientation and the so-called map-tie problem. Images as provided by the PanCam allow to determine accurate tilt and north directions for each lander and to identify the lander locations based on landmarks, which can also be recognized in appropriate orbiter imagery. With this information, it will be further possible to improve the Mars-wide geodetic control point network and the resulting geometric precision of global map products. The major geoscientific objectives of the PanCam lander images are the recognition of surface features like ripples, ridges and troughs, and the identification and characterization of different rock and surface units based on their morphology, distribution, spectral characteristics, and physical properties. The analysis of the PanCam imagery will finally result in the generation of precise map products for each of the landing sites. So far comparative geologic studies of the Martian surface are restricted to the timely separated Mars Pathfinder and the two Viking Lander Missions. Further lander missions are in preparation (Beagle- 2, Mars Surveyor 03). NetLander provides the unique opportunity to nearly double the number of accessible landing site data by providing simultaneous and long-term observations at four different surface locations which becomes especially important for studies of variable surface features as well as properties and phenomena of the atmosphere. Major changes on the surface that can be detected by PanCam are caused by eolian activities and condensation processes, which directly reflect variations in the prevailing near-surface wind regime and the diurnal and seasonal volatile and dust cycles. Atmospheric studies will concentrate on the detection of clouds, measurements of the aerosol contents and the water vapor absorption at 936 nm. In order to meet these objectives, the proposed PanCam instrument is a highly miniaturized, dedicated stereo and multispectral imaging device. The camera consists of two identical camera cubes, which are arranged in a common housing at a fixed stereo base length of 11 cm. Each camera cube is equipped with a CCD frame transfer detector with 1024 × 1024 active pixels and optics with a focal length of 13 mm yielding a field-of-view of 53 °× 53 ° and an instantaneous filed of view of 1. 1 mrad. A filter swivel with six positions provides different color band passes in the wavelength range of 400  950 nm. The camera head is mounted on top of a deployable scissors boom and can be rotated by 360 ° to obtain a full panorama, which is already covered by eight images. The <b>boom</b> <b>raises</b> the camera head to a final altitude of 90 cm above the surface. Most camera activities will take place within the first week and the first month of the mission. During the remainder of the mission, the camera will operate with a reduced data rate to monitor time-dependent variations on a daily basis. PanCam is a joint German/French project with contributions from DLR, Institute of Space Sensor Technology and Planetary Exploration, Berlin, Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale, CNRS, Orsay, and Service d'Aéronomie, CNRS, Verrières-le-Buisson...|$|R
