40|$|The {{first pillar}} of the pension system in the Czech Republic is loss-making in the long term. The {{population}} gets older which results in an increase of the pension budget deficit. The thesis elaborates that the population should no more depend on the government <b>in</b> <b>pensionable</b> <b>age.</b> The bachelor thesis further focuses on {{the analysis of the}} second and third pillar profitability as well as on analysis of to what extent the government should intervene in these pillars. The author provides comprehensive overview of pension systems in countries of the Visegrad Group, and reveals the correlation between their profitability and governmental interventions. Furthermore, the thesis compares attitude of particular governments towards the pension system pillars, and summarizes their advantages and drawbacks for the Czech population...|$|R
30|$|It is easy {{to check}} that if the {{government}} could implement both parameters (R, α), the optimal redistribution degree would be no redistribution for the Right-wing criterion. But, our point is that changes <b>in</b> the <b>pensionable</b> <b>age</b> will only be achieved by governments {{with the support of}} a vast majority of the population. For that reason, we consider a second-best option scheme. The government chooses one parameter (α) and people choose the other one (R).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article explores {{whether and}} to what degree {{information}} on the so-cioeconomic status – measured by professional status and disposable household income – allows making reliable statements on the willingness to remain in work in retirement age. These observations are controlled for professional and individual characteristics. The data basis is constituted by the study entitled “Continuing <b>in</b> employment <b>in</b> <b>pensionable</b> <b>age</b> ” with N = 1, 500 dependent employees aged from 55 to under 65. Logistic regressions show that the socioeconomic status makes a statistically-signifi cant contribution towards explaining the willingness to continue in employment: In comparison to employees with a lower or medium professional status, those individuals who have a high professional status tended to be signifi-cantly more willing to remain in working life for longer. There is a negative connec-tion between the disposable household income and the willingness to remain in employment in retirement age. The signifi cant effects that were found are however restricted to {{the women in the}} study...|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of global output {{will continue to}} shift towards emerging economies as well as towards Asia; the combined GDP of China and India was 33 % of that of the OECD in 2010 (on a PPP basis), but {{is expected to rise}} to 73 % by 2060. ● Providing growth of the technology frontier continues at historical rates, average growth in OECD GDP per capita over the period to 2060 is projected to be similar to the 1 per cent per annum experienced in the immediate pre-crisis period. ● With only a few major exceptions, the adverse effect of population ageing on labour utilisation in OECD countries will be largely offset by rising labour force participation. Up until 2030, this is achieved in most countries through already legislated increases <b>in</b> <b>pensionable</b> <b>age,</b> the positive effect of increased education and trend increases in female participation. Beyond 2030 it will require additional reforms to ensure that retirement ages are effectively indexed to life expectancy. ● The crisis is estimated to have reduced OECD-wide potential output per capita by about 3 per cent. For some European, mainly euro area, countries, the effect has been much larger, with the reduction i...|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{in order}} to obtain a larger social consensus, it would be {{appropriate}} to combine the delay <b>in</b> the <b>pensionable</b> <b>age</b> with an increase in the redistributive nature of the pension system. Even a government that put more emphasis on efficiency than on equity could be in favour of some positive level of redistribution with an aim to making a delay in the legal retirement age easier. This implies that it may not always be useful to strengthen the link between life-time contributions and pension benefits, one of the more habitual measures that is being proposed to encourage people to work longer. This measure should only be applied together with reforms aimed at increasing the flexibility of the pension system’s retirement rules.|$|R
40|$|Approximately {{half the}} world's {{population}} now has replacement-level fertility or below. The UK experience in accommodating to a changing dependency ratio provides some generalizable insights. A mechanistic approach assuming a fixed retirement age {{and a need}} to raise fertility or increase immigration {{in order to maintain}} pensions at a fixed proportion {{of the gross domestic product}} (GDP) is overstated and wrong. It needs to be replaced by a welfare optimizing model, which takes into account the increasing years of healthy life, a slow rise <b>in</b> the <b>pensionable</b> <b>age,</b> capital inheritance and wider welfare considerations of population density that are not reflected in GDP measures. A combined replacement ratio (CRR) is suggested for developed countries combining the impact of the fertility rate and immigration rate. A CRR above 2 implies continued population growth. The current UK CRR of 2. 48 is higher than needed for pension reasons, and it is suggested that it exceeds the welfare maximizing level...|$|R
40|$|How can public pension systems be {{reformed}} to ensure fiscal {{stability in the}} face of increasing life expectancy?� To address this pressing open question in public finance, we estimate a life-cycle model in which the optimal employment, retirement and consumption decisions of forward-looking individuals depend, inter alia, on life expectancy and the design of the public pension system. � We calculate that, in the case of Germany, the fiscal consequences of the 6. 4 year increase in age 65 life expectancy anticipated to occur over the 40 years that separate the 1942 and 1982 birth cohorts can be offset by either an increase of 4. 43 years <b>in</b> the full <b>pensionable</b> <b>age</b> or a cut of 37. 7 % in the per-year value of public pension benefits. � Of these two distinct policy approaches to coping with the fiscal consequences of improving longevity, increasing the full <b>pensionable</b> <b>age</b> generates the largest responses in labor supply and retirement behavior.
