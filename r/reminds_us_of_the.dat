25|$|But, {{whatever}} {{might be}} Shaftesbury's speculative opinions or his mode of expressing them, all witnesses bear {{testimony to the}} elevation and purity {{of his life and}} aims. As an earnest student, and ardent lover of liberty, an enthusiast in the cause of virtue, and a man of unblemished life and untiring beneficence, Shaftesbury probably had no superior in his generation. His character and pursuits are the more remarkable, considering the rank of life in which he was born and the circumstances under which he was brought up. In many respects he <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stoic philosopher and Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose works he studied with avidity, and whose influence is stamped upon his own productions.|$|E
500|$|On its exhibition, The Combat was {{generally}} highly praised by critics for its technical excellence, its {{combination of the}} Venetian and English styles of painting, and as an indication that Etty was moving away from nudity and towards history painting. The European Magazine, and London Review commented that [...] "in colour this picture strongly <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great heroes of the Venetian school, while in learned intelligence of form, and energy of action, it greatly surpasses them", observing that [...] "we should not have the least objection to seeing this picture placed {{in one of the}} very first galleries, by the side of Titian and Paul Veronese." ...|$|E
500|$|And he {{denounced the}} German {{military}} for their policies against the resistance {{forces in the}} occupied lands. On 26 October 1941 he wrote: In France two German officers have been shot by unknown murderers, in Nantes and Bordeaux. In retribution fifty citizens {{in each of these}} towns were apprehended and executed. To let people who are completely innocent suffer for the deed of another <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terrific deeds of wild beasts in times long gone. It was General von Stulpnagel's lot to revive one of the most gruesome deeds. The world will rightfully be upset over so much inhumanity, and a hate will burn that can never be extinguished...

500|$|In 2008's Halla Bol, Vidya {{played a}} {{supporting}} role alongside Ajay Devgn and Pankaj Kapur. The story {{was based on the}} life of activist Safdar Hashmi, who was killed by political rivals while performing in a street play (Halla Bol) in 1989. The film was a critical failure. Later that year, she co-starred with Shahid Kapoor in Aziz Mirza's romantic comedy Kismat Konnection. Faring poorly at the box office, the film and her performance generated a negative response; critic Sonia Chopra commented, [...] " [...] is made to look downright drab. The haircut is unflattering, the make-up too plain, the clothes usually in off-white or brown. Plus the character is repetitive and <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> one she played in Lage Raho Munna Bhai." ...|$|E
500|$|The five [...] "Lucy poems" [...] {{are often}} {{interpreted}} as representing Wordsworth's opposing views {{of nature as}} well as meditations on the cycle of life. They describe a variety of relationships between humanity and nature. For example, Lucy {{can be seen as}} a connection between humanity and nature, as a [...] "boundary being, nature sprite and human, yet not quite either. She <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional mythical person who lives, ontologically, an intermediate life, or mediates various realms of existence." [...] Although the poems evoke a sense of loss, they also hint at the completeness of Lucy's life—she was raised by nature and survives in the memories of others. She became, in the opinion of the American poet and writer David Ferry (b. 1924), [...] "not so much a human being as a sort of compendium of nature", while [...] "her death was right, after all, for by dying she was one with the natural processes that made her die, and fantastically ennobled thereby".|$|E
500|$|According to The Kansas City Star Smith, [...] "Frank hasn’t changed, {{and neither}} has his brand of Machiavellian {{political}} theater" [...] and [...] "Spacey has lost {{none of his}} smarmy magnetism as the cartoon-ish villain". According to Variety Brian Lowry, [...] "Kevin Spacey’s showy performance as an unscrupulous politician" [...] is foremost among the show's strengths, but the show's weakness is the [...] "failure to present its scheming protagonist with equally matched foes". Lowry feels that as conniving as Underwood is, it is unfathomable that [...] "nobody else in a town built on power seems particularly adept at recognizing this or combating him". Goodman says [...] "Spacey {{is nothing if not}} constantly magnetic". The delayed use of the fourth wall is perceived as clever. Alison Willmore of Indiewire says that [...] "Unlike Walter White or Tony Soprano, Frank feels at peace with his ruthless pragmatism and what he does in pursuit of power, and <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact in his asides to the camera...he may be a ruthless sociopath, but there's something to admire there". [...] However Willmore noted that Frank became lighter in season 2 noting that the season was [...] "...delivered with more of a wink by Frank than before." ...|$|E

Into this social milieu of young versus old, rich versus poor, tradition versus modern came the unexpected emergence of Fidrych and his innocence and joy that captured hearts and imaginations for the entire Bicentennial summer.|$|E
2500|$|The poem [...] "Thermopylae" [...] <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> famous {{battle of}} Thermopylae where the 300 Spartans {{and their allies}} fought against the greater numbers of Persians, {{although}} they knew {{that they would be}} defeated. There are some principles in our lives that we should live by, and Thermopylae is the ground of duty. We stay there fighting although we know that there is the potential for failure. (At the end the traitor Ephialtes will appear, leading the Persians through the secret trail).|$|E
2500|$|In the process, {{they adopted}} {{most of the}} Toltec/Nahua (code) pantheon, but they also made {{significant}} changes in their religion. As the Mexica rose in power, they adopted the Nahua gods at equal status to their own. For instance, Tlaloc was the rain god of all the Nahuatl-speaking peoples. They put their local god Huitzilopochtli {{at the same level}} as the ancient Nahua god, and also replaced the Nahua Sun god with their own. Thus, Tlaloc/Huitzilopochtli represents the duality of water and fire, as evidenced by the twin pyramids uncovered near the Zocalo in Mexico City in the late 1970s, and it <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warrior ideals of the Aztec: the Aztec glyph of war is [...] "burning water".|$|E

2500|$|In a review, The New York Times {{called it}} [...] "a first-rate novel", stating that [...] "Sethi's prose evokes the comic mislocutions of Jonathan Safran Foer and the vertiginous mania of Zadie Smith. The Wall Street Journal stated that, [...] "Mr. Sethi is {{especially}} alive {{to the emotional}} contours of young love, its modes of courtship, its methods of subterfuge... Mr. Sethi's prose, always lucid, often soars to illuminate the quotidian." [...] Arifa Akbar of The Independent also reviewed the book positively saying, [...] "Sethi's narration is engaging and funny, and although it rambles off into distracted corners at times, it is slickly structured. It takes us from the present day, back across personal and political histories, and returns to a bittersweet ending which <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power of making wishes and the miracle of having them, even in part, fulfilled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ryan's {{poems are}} often quite short. In {{one of the}} first essays on Ryan, Dana Gioia wrote about this aspect of her poetry. [...] "Ryan <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suggestive power of poetry–how it elicits and rewards the reader’s intellect, imagination, and emotions. I like to think that Ryan’s magnificently {{compressed}} poetry – along with the emergence of other new masters of the short poem like Timothy Murphy and H.L. Hix and the veteran maestri like Ted Kooser and Dick Davis – signals a return to concision and intensity." [...] Ryan tends to avoid using the personal [...] "I" [...] in her poetry, claiming that she [...] "didn’t want confession. [...] didn’t want to be Anne Sexton." [...] Though distanced, her work is often deeply introspective, analyzing both the nature of the mind [...] and the ability of language to mold reality.|$|E
2500|$|Another reason Tillich criticized {{theological}} theism {{was because}} it placed God into the subject-object dichotomy. This is the basic distinction made in Epistemology, that branch of Philosophy which deals with human knowledge, how it is possible, what it is, and its limits. Epistemologically, God cannot be made into an object, that is, an object of the knowing subject. Tillich deals with this question {{under the rubric of}} the relationality of God. The question is [...] "whether there are external relations between God and the creature". Traditionally Christian theology has always understood the doctrine of creation to mean precisely this external relationality between God, the Creator, and the creature as separate and not identical realities. Tillich <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> point, which can be found in Luther, that [...] "there is no place to which man can withdraw from the divine thou, because it includes the ego and is nearer to the ego than the ego to itself".|$|E

2500|$|Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media viewed [...] "Countdown" [...] as {{a sequel}} to Beyoncé's own 2003 single, [...] "Crazy in Love". Matthew Horton of BBC {{compared}} the musical style of [...] "Countdown" [...] to that of M.I.A.'s work. John Mitchell of MTV Newsroom wrote that [...] "'' has a flair that <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> ... <b>the</b> best tracks from B'Day." [...] Similarly, Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Countdown" [...] is a [...] "playful [...] inventive jam", in tradition of [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] (2007), adding the former [...] "revisits the [...] "sassy spirit" [...] of the latter. Jocelyn Vena added that while [...] "Countdown" [...] is different form other songs on 4, it has a [...] "Check on It" [...] vibe. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle commented that the song shares the same [...] "frenetic club swagger" [...] as previous Destiny's Child singles such as [...] "Bug a Boo" [...] (1999) and [...] "Jumpin', Jumpin'" [...] (2000).|$|E
2500|$|... "Beautiful Tonight" [...] was {{confirmed}} as the follow-up single {{on the third}} week of January through the Daily Star. The release date is yet to be announced. They stated, [...] "You can imagine our next single Beautiful Tonight being played in a club. Yes, it’s that different to what we usually release. John Shanks wrote it and it’s up-tempo and will open a few eyes and ears. People who don’t usually like Westlife might like it and hopefully people who do like us won’t not like it. It’s young, fresh and exciting so we feel brilliant about it coming out. When they first hear it, some people might go: [...] "Whoa, who is that?” and that’s why we wanted it as our first song on the album. It’d be cool to get a couple of good dance remixes off it but we won’t be coming up with a dance routine for it on tour, except for maybe a few clicks and putting {{one foot in front of}} the other. The song <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early days when we put out [...] "World of Our Own". The song was performed live on Irish national television show Paul O'Grady Show. After that, the track peaked at the top 40 of Irish Radio Airplay Chart.|$|E
2500|$|The book {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Gail Caldwell of The Boston Globe {{called it a}} [...] "thoroughly charming and melodic novel," [...] adding that it was [...] "small and glistening, one confident little shooting star instead of a cumbersome light show." [...] American magazine The Atlantic Monthly praised the book, writing that [...] " [...] is an enormous technical accomplishment that <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> difference between linguistic hocus-pocus and real writing; more important, it casts a spell." [...] Adam Begley of The New York Observer called it [...] "A delightful book," [...] adding that it is [...] "a satire that's playful but not cuddly, tart but not bitter, thoughtful but not heavy." [...] Publishers Weekly commented [...] "so sure-handed are Smith's overlapping descriptions of the same events from different viewpoints that her simple, disquieting story lifts into brilliance." [...] Michael Schaub of San Francisco Chronicle wrote [...] "as dark as the novel can be, there are genuinely funny moments as well," [...] adding that [...] "the last sentence of the book manages to be enlightening, confusing and almost destructive in its simple power." [...] The Times Literary Supplement wrote that the book is [...] "original, restless, formally and morally challenging." ...|$|E
