In this paper, stochastic medium model {{was used in}} the foundation pit engineering ground surface movements. The adjacent ground surface movement and deformation due to dewatering and around body losing cross bloster is analyzed. Since any excavation will cause the surrounding surface movement and deformation, however, any ground and underground construction (structures) have certain structural strength, which has a certain <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> displacement and deformation capacity [1]. If the deformation of the ground is expected that the results were less than the maximum permitted Level protection of building structures deformation value, the building structures will not change significantly damage, or can be made by a simple process and does not affect the normal use; if the deformation of the ground the results are expected to exceed the maximum allowable Level protection of building structures deformation value, you can take the reinforcement of building structures, pre-reinforcement measures or adjust excavation programs to achieve conservation purposes. People study model of surface movement and deformation is caused by excavation, especially from the gravity stress research underground coal mining began from underground mines. In China, the study of surface coal movement law has made considerable progress in the establishment based on probability integration method, negative exponential function method and the typical curve of surface deformation prediction methodology. Which is particularly widespread application of probability integration method, which greatly promoted the development of the cause of the "three under mining, " and China's entry into the list of international advanced in this area, [2, 3, 4, 5]...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse {{alternative}} discharging methods of HVDC cables for a DC test in a real situation. It is necessary to research relevant data and consult contacts in order to solve the task. The project {{is based on the}} implementation of a developed system on the testing object and preceded by tests in the High Voltage Laboratory in Karlskrona. Simultaneously the main requirement is to completely exclude any human contribution in the discharging process of the DC cable and to maintain the highest safety standards in line with ABB policy. Currently the discharge process after DC testing is completed manually. Testing is carried out by increasing the voltage until the test voltage is reached and kept constant throughout the test period. Followed by switching off the voltage and allowing the cable to initially self-discharge, before it forces the discharge through the discharging water resistor. When the voltage is zero, cable termination ground by providing a secure grounding. Initially the cable charges out through self-discharge and this must continue down to the Uo. To avoid damaging the test object by maintaining the voltage for too long, discharge can begin after 45 minutes if the voltage drops below under 1, 2 Uo. The forced discharge occurs by an earth rod connecting the discharge <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Past tests have shown the occasional use of a linked up Water Conditioning Unit system consisting of the pump and filters to ground out by hoses filled with deionized water. This method has been reviewed and modernized which made it more accessible and reliable...|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of the Clyde Dam on the Clutha River formed part of a scheme to generate electricity for the national grid. A proposed smelter at Aramoana on Otago Harbour was never built—largely owing <b>to</b> <b>resistance</b> on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> of <b>the</b> environmental damage {{that would have been}} a consequence.|$|R
30|$|Analysis of fault {{data can}} reveal {{incorrect}} setup of power system equipment or incorrect field wiring that was missed during field commissioning tests. Results {{of the analysis}} {{can be used to}} take corrective action and avoid future misoperations. For example, this event shows that the CT at Station 2 was installed with an incorrect polarity. As a result, the direction of the current was reversed and can affect the reliability and performance of directional relays. Furthermore, the phase A current measurement at Station 1 was missing. It is possible that the phase CT has not been connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> DFR and can result in loss of valuable information. The fault was observed <b>to</b> have encountered <b>the</b> least <b>resistance</b> path <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> which coincides with the root cause of the fault. Finally, Station 2 was learned to be electrically weaker than Station 1.|$|R

A low <b>resistance</b> path <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> is noted <b>to</b> be essential for any turbine system, including metal paths on nonmetal blades <b>to</b> conduct <b>the</b> strike. Surge arrestors {{are necessary to}} protect against overvoltages both from utility lines in normal operation and against lightning damage to control equipment and contactors in the generator. MOS structures are susceptible to static discharge injury, as are other semiconductor devices, and must be protected {{by the presence of}} static protection circuitry. It is recommended that the electronics be analyzed for the circuit transient response to a lightning waveform, to induced and dc current injection, that input/output leads be shielded, everything be grounded, and lightning-resistant components be chosen early in the design phase...|$|R

They are flexible and modular, making them suitable to implement higher order filters. The circuits implement the resistors using matched transistors, operating in linear region, making them {{well suited for}} IC fabrication. They are insensitive to parasitic input capacitances and input <b>resistances</b> due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> internally <b>grounded</b> input terminals of OTRA.

40|$|Operational transresistance {{amplifier}} (OTRA) is {{the most}} suitable analog building block (ABB) for transimpedance type signal processing due to its very nature of current input and voltage output. In this paper, OTRA-based transimpedance instrumentation amplifier (TIA) is presented. It provides high differential gain and bandwidth, which is independent of gain. It also offers high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The amplifier gain can be controlled electronically by implementing resistors using MOS transistors operating in linear region. The circuit can be made fully integrated. The proposed circuit is insensitive to parasitic input capacitances and input <b>resistances</b> due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> internally <b>grounded</b> input terminals of OTRA.

40|$|The nonlinear, core-conductor {{model of}} action {{potential}} propagation down axisymmetric nerve fibers is adapted for an implicit, numerical simulation by computer {{solution of the}} differential equations. The calculation allows a septum to be inserted in the model fiber; the thin, passive septum is characterized by series resistance Rsz and shunt <b>resistance</b> Rss <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounded</b> bath. If Rsz is too large or Rss too small, <b>the</b> signal fails <b>to</b> propagate through <b>the</b> septum. Plots of the action potential profiles for various axial positions are obtained and show distortions due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presence of the septum. A simple linear model, developed from these simulations, relates propagation delay through the septum and <b>the</b> preseptal risetime <b>to</b> Rsz and Rss. This model agrees with the simulations {{for a wide range}} of parameters and allows estimation of Rsz and Rss from measured propagation delays at the septum. Plots of the axial current as a function of both time and position demonstrate how the presence of the septum can cause prominent local reversals of the current. This result, not previously described, suggests that extracellular magnetic measurements of cellular action currents could be useful in the biophysical study of septated fibers...|$|R

5000|$|A major latter-day {{debate about}} German {{military}} justice {{has been the}} demand by families of Wehrmacht men executed for desertion {{that they should be}} recognized as part of <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Hitler under <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> that by refusing <b>to</b> fight for <b>the</b> Nazi regime, they were also opposing it. Messerschmidt and Wüllner wrote that many of Wehrmacht desertions were politically motivated out of disgust with the genocidal politics of the Nazi regime, and that [...] "Whom were these military judges serving who sent soldiers to their deaths? In numerous judgments, this questions is clearly answered: they were serving the Führer, final victory, Nazi Germany". German veterans have for the most part been opposed to this. Only in September 2009 did Germany pardon the men convicted of desertion under <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> that <b>to</b> desert from a criminal war was not a crime. At the time, there were three Wehrmacht deserters still alive, the vast majority having been either executed or killed in penal battalions during the war, and the few who survived the war were shunned as traitors and cowards by the German public after the war. One of the surviving deserters, a sailor who attempted to desert in 1942 named Ludwig Baumann, summarized the arguments against people such as himself as: [...] "It went like this: an act of treason might have endangered the lives of other German soldiers, therefore we can't absolve you. But what I say is, if only more soldiers had committed treason so many millions of lives could have been saved, in the concentration camps and so on. You can't place the lives of some soldiers above all those millions who died. And until Germany recognizes this, it will not have broken with its Nazi past." ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> coefficient of drag resistance (µ) between a log and bare forest soil during partial suspension yarding. Drag resistance {{in this study was}} defined as <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> due <b>to</b> friction between <b>the</b> soil and the log plus <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plowing action of the log in the soil. The coefficient of drag resistance is the ratio of the drag <b>resistance</b> forces parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and <b>the</b> normal support force between the log and <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Data were collected on four test plots on Paul Dunn and McDonald State Forests located {{in the foothills of the}} Coast Range in Oregon. A photographic technique was developed <b>to</b> measure <b>the</b> value of the drag resistance coefficient during yarding. This method used angles measured from a photograph of a yarded log and <b>the</b> logs dimensions <b>to</b> ca 1 cu 1 ate µ. The method is based on the equilibrium of the forces on the log at the instant the photographic sample was taken. Data were taken <b>to</b> determine both <b>the</b> static and dynamic drag resistance coefficient for uphill yarding of young growth Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) logs. Regression equations were developed <b>to</b> predict <b>the</b> static µ as a function of log geometry, ground slope, soil texture, soil moisture, and soil density. These equations suggest that soil moisture and <b>ground</b> slope are <b>the</b> most significant variables in explaining µ, with log geometry, soil texture and soil density playing a less important role. The equations developed were verified using a chi-square test for goodness-of-fit to compare predicted and observed values of µ on additional data. Analysis of the data collected for the dynamic drag resistance coefficient revealed that the assumptions of the measurement method were violated so no regression equations were developed. Suggestions were given on the conditions required for <b>the</b> method <b>to</b> work. A load factor was developed which indicates the increase in log load capacity for a skyline logging system when dragging rather than flying a log load. The calculations for the load factor were based on the results of the study...|$|R
