40|$|Introduction Architecture {{is quite}} often judged {{on the final}} result, the {{architectural}} object – the form. Is it beautiful, is it ugly? Our architecture is not about form. Not at all. We actually never talk about form in the office. We for instance talk about context, or construction or we talk about sites, all the influences which come from the outside {{and we talk about}} materials. And sometimes we talk about sustainability. I want to show you how we try to come to obvious architecture. I'm going to do it by labelling our process and the process has three components. So, first we figure out what the human context of the project is, with a client we define what are the joint positions we want to take, second we analyse the physical context and then third, only when we have established all these preoccupations, we come to creating architecture. We don't get to design until all the context is really clear. I want to show you <b>real</b> <b>quickly,</b> we don’t have much time, so I will not go into detail, some of our projects that illustrate that idea quite clearly. I'm going to talk about our projects this way over and over again, human context, physical context and maybe then architectural expression, the so called form. But it is not really a form. It is a result. Obvious architecture. 1. 	 Starting with our office. We have our office in an old chicory factory in the rural Petegem aan de Schelde. It actually clearly illustrates our vision. We call the building IDEEELL. As an anagram of the original name De Lelie, ideeel means idealistic. which suits us well. In short, you might say that the entire complex was divided into three elements: the drying tower, the storehouse and the oven/transport area. Listening to the original building made it easy to decide what comes where. The drying tower becomes the residence, silently in the back, with a majestic view on the pimples of the Flemish Ardennes. The large oven and transport area naturally became the gallery and the storehouse, on the ground floor, becomes our office. These decisions define the most part of the design of the building. It is the human context, the start of everything. Be aware, although probably everybody now feels, yes, those functions feel really logical in those areas of the complex. It was a real pain to obtain the building application. The drying tower {{at the end of the}} site, because the building is so deep, lies outside of the residential zoning. So that part of the factory is actually zonevreemd. I don’t really know the word in English, probably it doesn’t exist. Unzoned maybe? It seems something typically Belgian. We stated that the chicory factory could only be preserved as architectural heritage if the building got a new destination. If not, the decay would be inevitable. Eventually, after seven years and much deliberation it was accepted that the historically valuable building could get a new destination and the permit was granted. This is also context for the architecture, and how it will look in the end. It directs us in a design direction. Only at this point, with all these elements already in place, we get to look at the physical context of the site, and the building. With much attention to the original structure and the assets of the original construction, It was clear a better entry of daylight and sun were of importance, but also the insulation of the whole. Actually, the storehouse and oven area formed a good basis for our office, but both the thermal and acoustic insulation where terrible though. So we kept it very simple: we applied a second skin on the inside of the outer walls, an independent volume that in a way encloses the interior of the office. These walls provide the needed thermal insulation and acoustic muting. That’s it. We left everything else untouched. A very understandable and obvious architecture. The drying tower needed more work, as it was a closed hull with tiny holes, and no real flooring. So we excavated the drying tower and it’s vertical shaft from the inside so only the 'outer shell' of brick remained. This fragile volume had openings in the outer walls that could be used as windows, but they were not big enough. Where we needed extra light, we made larger window openings: we combined several smaller windows to larger openings to allow daylight and sunlight into the house. We wanted to make the windows bigger without losing it’s former atmosphere, so we enlarged them proportionally until they just touch each other, forming a massive opening in relationship to the former openings. The feeling of transparency played a key role in the interior, horizontally and vertically: in the skylight, in the glass walls and in the steel grates of the staircases. Everything is beneficial to the overall openness. It is extraordinary to see that the cultural history of a landscape or building can have a beautiful future. It’s a nice place to work. 2. 	 From here on, I will show some selected projects from small to large, but always clearly showing the human and physical context elements as the basis for the architecture. The second project I want to show, we call LIGHT HOUSE, is a the renovation of a small house in the center of Ghent. A project for myself and my family. The modest corner house overlooks the merging of the rivers Schelde and Leie. On every floor the house has a unique view on the Portus Ganda. For the house, an unconventional arrangement was chosen. The kitchen, dining room and sitting room are housed on the second and third floor; while the bedrooms are on the ground floor and the first floor. This ensures a lot of privacy in the living areas and accordingly the windows don’t need to be blinded. Shielding the living areas on the ground floor often makes for a lifeless character in cities, as usually the bedrooms are also covered and therefore no one seems to live in these houses. In this house, there is always light and life to be seen from the street. The challenge was to utilize the minimal available space in this small house to a maximum without losing openness and lightness. Every corner of the house is utilized. This results in a logical organization. To enlarge the spatial feeling further in this tiny house, everything inside is executed in white. The walls, the ceilings, the stairs. Vertical extensions on the white roof form a contemporary expression in contrast to the neo-classicistic white stucco cornice. The shape of these dormers is the result of extending the existing façade structure. The dimensions of the windows in the façade beneath were transferred in the roof volume in which the left window was extended up to the roof-ridge, as a vertical element on top of the vertical house. A beacon. A light house. 3. 	 This project BAGATEL, a bagatel is a trifle, something of small meaning, we did for an artist and his family has a interesting story. The artists house, in the middle of the ‘mondaine’ coastal town Knokke was in his family for a long time and had emotional value. His contemporary, ragged, simple way of life makes it almost like living on an artistic island in a sea of superficiality. He didn’t want to move though (what would have been the sane way) but asked for a total reconversion of the building to fit his very specific needs. The highly complex human context here is of great importance. The building is conceived as a trans generative vertical house and home to four generations. The owner, his parents, his grown children and his son of 11. This created a very interesting layering, literally and figuratively. In the small gallery on the ground floor, small-scale creations, installations and paintings are on display and for sale. It is also used as an intermediate space in the public domain. On the first lies the studio for de grandparents, on the second floor are the studio flats for the grown children. The common kitchen and dining-room are situated on the third floor. The householder’s rooms are on the fourth, fifth and sixth floor: workshop, living room and bedroom. The house is situated on a very narrow plot between two six-storey blocks of flats, in a street with a strong verticality. The challenge was to make maximum use of the narrow site and to strongly optimize the living quality of it. The lot was optimally used without compromising on openness and lightness by drastic choices for more transparency To accentuate the fineness of the site and the building, the façade offers an extremely transparent sight while the systematic jutting highlights the smallness of the site. The façade at the back is also totally transparent. This allows a view right through the building on several spots, and creates a marvellous unlimited living experience. To strengthen this idea of see trough, we decided to not implement stairs on the top floors. Only the glass lift. This way, the need for escape stairs define the look of the back façade. Obvious. This idea of see-trough continues diagonally in the different floors via the elevator shaft in transparent glass. On the fifth floor (living room) and on the sixth floor (bedroom), this diagonal spatial connection is even reinforced by a glass sheet in the floor of the sixth level. To bring even more light in the heart of the building, the roof has extensions and cut-outs. In addition to the fine outer wall, the roof was covered with white pvc. This is a sustainable roof with maximum reflection, influencing the indoor climate in a positive way. The communication during the design and construction process was very intense and colourful, a psychological analysis of all the construction partners. 4. 	 Another project with interesting clients, to say the least, under construction at the moment, is the house called RAG DOLL. A rag doll is a stuffed cloth doll, traditionally made from different scraps of material. The house in fact is just that. More than 2 years ago, we helped these clients searching for a fitting house. A very difficult task. We visited 22 different locations. Cottages, farmhouses, contemporary minimal houses, castles, building lots. It was very difficult for them, not only to find a fitting building or site, but also to find the style or feel they wanted. Do they want a contemporary house, or an over the top cottage, and where? In the city? In the countryside? Everything was on the table. Eventually an old cottage villa at the coast was found, without delivering lot of architectural input, we felt that the location and feel of this house seemed fitting for them. A long road of pro-bono searching ended. Meanwhile the clients got doubts about working with us, instigated by some acquaintances and family, saying we are to ‘visionary’. So we didn’t hear from them anymore. For six months. Apparently, in those months, they contacted 11 architects for the project. Visited al lot of their projects, made appointments. Oh dear. In the end, after half a year in silence, they called us anyway, saying they want us to do their project. We found the whole process, while somewhat comical, inspiring. House or farm, city or countryside, renovation or newly built, cottage or contemporary, this architect or that architect? This opposition became the core of the design process for us. A printout of the duality and doubts of the clients. The human context. It becomes a fascinating rag doll. The project involves the renovation and restoration of the protected villa, with a focus on strengthening the existing character. The project is actually quite rational. The client absolutely wanted a large basement underneath the house. The house is registered and protected by the city hall, so demolishing it is impossible. A challenge. Building the basement, means that we have to hold up the entire house above the ground floor. So we decided this is a perfect basis for the design. We just cut the entire house under the roof, so the whole ground floor can be glazed. The transparent ground floor sets itself inferior to the villa above, of which the roof sits firmly above the whole. There is an interaction between new and old. A transparent contemporary atmosphere in contrast with the atmosphere of the early 20 th century. All facades remain untouched in its totality and current form. We consider it actually as a useful relic, nestled in a new structure and infrastructure. The house doesn’t really change from the surroundings. It’s only from the inside that the drastic change becomes visible. It is actually a beautiful contrast. The glazed ground floor and the protected cottage above. A good expression of duality we found in the clients. And they will have it all: city and countryside, renovation and newly built, cottage and contemporary, this architect and that architect. 5. 	 Zoning is really important for the typical urban planner in Belgium. We are, on the other hand, in total disagreement with walling off different uses in zones. With this project, called FACTORY ROOF HOUSES, we are hinting towards combining these things. Treating a factory roof, which is otherwise unused (water impermeable) surface, as a building lot for housing can provide a small answer to the ever increasing population pressure. The industrial building itself is a simple rectangular stirdy volume. The roof houses on top are built in a simple way. Basic and affordable timber framed buildings with a spacious outside area. This outdoor space, which is actually an extension of the interior space, offers a very spatial and unique character. Researching and developing genuine possibilities and creating new perspectives in day to day (built) projects is how we like to see sustainability. Perhaps it is not a utopia: Recuperating the gigantic amount of factory roofs as a second level for housing, farming or trading could maybe offer a fresh perspective on how to use our already crammed up landscape. 6. 	 The next project is called AVALON. Avalon is an in the mists hidden island. It houses 40 apartments. The presence of private and public areas was very important and the guiding principle. In terms of sustainability, the lifecycle and the lifespan of the building needs to be optimal. The master plan provides a long-range vision: adaptation, extension and conversion in view of the changing needs or desires (lifestyles) of the users is perfectly possible. This housing block had a very wide footprint, which means that there are always (less valued) north faced apartments and (more valued) south faced ones. We asked ourselves how to resolve this issue, and get direct sunlight in the north faced apartments. Thanks to recesses and cut-outs defined by the azimuth of the sun, natural light enters into the heart of the building. This ensures thermal gains while the openings and the generous terraces also allow light and sun in the flats. Moreover, they soften the monolithic and massive character of the building and provide a better connection with the smaller scale of the surroundings. Avalon is an ideal holistic community. On the level of urban development and architecture, it is a sustainable building with complete coherence in the social, cultural, agricultural, architectural and urban field. It is a composition of light and darkness, of watching and being watched, of sound and silence, a psychic metabolism. The matrix is based on a necessity that characterizes the naturalness of both the use and the perception of space. Avalon is a sustainable building in a social, ecological, economical and ethical context. 7. 	 The last project I want to show, RAVELIJN, is a competition we won for a city ​​densification in Zoutleeuw, Vlaams Brabant. The assignment is a large park containing a large residential care center, 45 houses, renovation of the old town hall and a youth center, mainly for scouts. The building permit for this project just approved this week actually. It is actually a PPS, public private collaboration. Our clients are thus both the city of Zoutleeuw and partners of Ackermans & Van Haaren. We are somewhat in the middle. Anyway, this was the plan attached to the competition, the RUP zoning. Analysing the site, we really felt that the zone for residential care center was badly located. In the shadows of a large water extraction plant. A permanent twilight zone without any place with direct sunlight. Also, the zone has an important buffer function, it shields the massive water factory. The planned location of the nursing home in this area seems therefore inappropriate. On the other hand the building for the youth center seemed to fit perfectly in this forest area. It is a lot smaller, so the tree area can remain entirely intact, a play forest which is also a green buffer. The original location for the Youth building on the other hand, has a sublime relationship of with the beautiful surroundings with light, visibility, silence and air quality. The nursibg home can have a strong relationship with the housing project there. Think of shared utilities. So we decided to switch these two zones in our proposal. Which is quite risky. But we believe so strongly in this human context, we convinced our partners there was no other way. This is the only good solution. This drastic point of view won us the competition. It opened the eyes of the city department, and actually shut it for the other projects in the competition. The architectural form became unimportant. It shows the importance of human context. The physical context then shaped the architecture into these environments. The youth center becomes a concrete bunker in the middle of the forest. A bunker that is turned towards the inside patio but can be opened or closed entirely to the forest with large sectional garage doors. The houses form a compact group with play streets and south oriented gardens, based on the Vauban shape of the former strongholds. The nursing home is a building under an intensive green roof that forms a raised surface. The building is solid and low. It embraces and protects it’s residents. In the top of the plinth, on the terraces, there is a space for plants or vegetables. This way, the facade is a true interactive green facade, at the same time activating the lives of seniors by letting them take care of the plants. Take care and be cared for. Again it shows that every project we do begins and ends with the human context. Outroductionstatus: publishe...|$|E

Holden insisted the on-camera shooting was fake, and that Reggie shot Todd over a dispute over money after the video was filmed. Holden says the kidnapping videos started as a hoax, but that Reggie has now actually kidnapped Willow.|$|R
40|$|Modern neoclassical {{economics}} {{is built on}} two pillars: (1) agents make optimal choices consistent with a completely specified maximand, and (2) the aggregate consequences of these individual choices are equilibria stable and unique enough to permit prediction. A glance at the profession’s leading journals readily confirms the ascendancy of the maximization cum equilibrium method. At the same time, few economists believe, least of all those most adept with the maximization cum equilibrium method, that real agents actually can and do make decisions with recourse to LaGrange and Hamilton, and that <b>real</b> markets <b>quickly</b> settle down into equilibria well-behaved enough for reliable prediction. And with good reason. For one thing, the experimental evidence is generally disconfirming. Theoretically, too, we know that cognitive resources are scarce, that nature is usually uncooperative in providing well-defined decision problems, and that in strategic settings multiple equilibria are ubiquitous. What is more, modern economic method is ordinarily silent on social structures. Institutions such as laws, norms, and conventions, and organizations such as firms and governments are typically made exogenous, beyond analysis. This removes from economics politica...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{explore the}} overlap between service and {{computerization}} using macro-level industrial {{data on the}} U. S. real estate market and five comparison industries (hospitals, financial services, legal services, machinery manufacturing, and fabricated metals). The macro-level data comes from the U. S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U. S. Census Bureau and we use it to develop insights on computerization and service relative to contributions to the U. S. gross domestic product. This analysis shows that while information and communication technology {{investments in real estate}} lagged comparison industries from 1969 to 1997, since then ICT investments in real estate have increased rapidly. At the same time, there has been a growth in the number workers even as the industry’s contribution to GDP has grown. We identify two implications of these findings. First, ICTs are not being used are not as a substitute for labor. Second, the rapid growth in ICT investments has been absorbed into <b>real</b> estate <b>quickly</b> and well. Still, computerization in real estate continues, suggesting that process studies and more micro-analyses are critical next steps...|$|R
40|$|Global Internet {{threats are}} {{undergoing}} a profound transformation from attacks designed solely to disable infrastructure {{to those that}} also target people and organizations. Behind these new attacks is a large pool of compromised hosts sitting in homes, schools, businesses, and governments around the world. These systems are infected with a bot that communicates with a bot controller and other bots to form what is {{commonly referred to as}} a zombie army or botnet. Botnets are a very <b>real</b> and <b>quickly</b> evolving problem that is still not well understood or studied. In this paper we outline the origins and structure of bots and botnets and use data from the operator community, the Internet Motion Sensor project, and a honeypot experiment to illustrate the botnet problem today. We then study the effectiveness of detecting botnets by directly monitoring IRC communication or other command and control activity and show a more comprehensive approach is required. We conclude by describing a system to detect botnets that utilize advanced command and control systems by correlating secondary detection data from multiple sources. ...|$|R

In response to Wheeler's video, the kidnappers make another vlog and cut off Holden's ear on-camera to prove they are serious. Although the ear is mailed to forensics and proven to be <b>real,</b> police <b>quickly</b> discover that Willow and Holden placed an online advertisement seeking actors to play kidnapper roles; they soon identify actor Reggie Luckman (Pedro Pascal) {{as one of the}} kidnappers in the WeepingWillow17 videos. Yet another vlog is released, this time with Holden escaping his bonds and shooting one of the kidnappers, before being shot himself by Reggie.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{challenge}} of finding common ground between the Finns and the Chinese {{in the context of}} co-operation, trade and inward investment facilitation related to general lack of specific interest displayed by the Chinese. The article is ethnographic in nature and is mainly based on data obtained from interviewing individuals working for local governments in Finland and one of the state agencies responsible for attracting foreign investment. The study uses Speech Codes Theory (Philipsen, 1997) when analyzing the cultural aspects of expectations regarding communication between Chinese and Finns. According to interviewees, lack of serious interest, vague government guidelines, the longer time needed to build relationship, and involvement of intermediaries all contribute to the difficulty to move the discussions to a more specific level of focus. Finnish expectations regarding this type of communication are that it should be direct and task-oriented, because they feel pressure to yield <b>real</b> results <b>quickly</b> and efficiently. Suggested strategies to make the co-operation talks more specific are presenting the expertise areas of Finland, clarification regarding too general terms used by the Chinese, and investing into building personal relationships with them...|$|R
40|$|The {{reticulate}} venation that {{is characteristic}} of a dicot leaf has excited interest from systematists {{for more than a}} century, and from physiological and developmental botanists for decades. The tools of digital image acquisition and computer image analysis, however, are only now approaching the sophistication needed to quantify aspects of the venation network found in <b>real</b> leaves <b>quickly,</b> easily, accurately, and reliably enough to produce biologically meaningful data. In this paper, we examine 120 leaves distributed across vascular plants (representing 118 genera and 80 families) using two approaches: a semiquantitative scoring system called “leaf ranking,” devised by the late Leo Hickey, and an automated image-analysis protocol. In the process of comparing these approaches, we review some methodological issues that arise in trying to quantify a vein network, and discuss {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} automatic data collection and human pattern recognition. We conclude that subjective leaf rank provides a relatively consistent, semiquantitative measure of areole size among other variables; that modal areole size is generally consistent across large sections of a leaf lamina; and that both approaches&# 8212;semiquantitative, subjective scoring; and fully quantitative, automated measurement&# 8212;have appropriate places in the study of leaf venation...|$|R
