Design: Patients were evaluated preoperatively and six months postoperatively by four different hip <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> (Harris, Iowa, Charnley and Merle d'Aubigne), both on a categorical and on a numerical basis. Setting: Department of orthopaedics and traumatology in a university hospital. Main outcome measures: Patients were evaluated by four <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> preoperatively and postoperatively either on a categorical or a numerical basis. Results: All patients showed significant improvement after surgery in all <b>rating</b> <b>systems.</b> Although preoperative categorical evaluation revealed that the strongest correlation was between Charnley and Merle d'Aubigne scores (r = 0. 876), numerical comparison of the <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> showed strong correlation among all systems, both pre- and postoperatively. Responsiveness analysis revealed larger effect size for the Iowa and Harris hip scores. Conclusions: Our results suggest that hip <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> should be compared numerically rather than by categorical evaluation and that the Iowa and Harris hip scores are more convenient in evaluating thrust plate prosthesis patients because they have larger effect sizes without floor and ceiling effects...|$|R

5|$|Detective Mode, {{allowing}} {{the investigation of}} crimes, was not considered an improvement by Kotaku and GameSpot; while they considered it a good idea, its execution was minimal since a player simply looks for the next highlighted piece of evidence rather than solving a puzzle. Game Informer liked it, {{saying that they were}} complicated and showed how Batman analyzes a crime scene. The combat system received mixed reviews. The shock gloves were criticized as overpowered and making fights too easy, allowing Batman unblockable attacks (instantly disabling most opponents) and removing the need for tactics. Reviewers said that changes to combat punished more than challenged; greater enemy numbers and variety made sustaining an attack difficult, and (combined with an array of gadgets which hinderedâ€”rather than damagedâ€”enemies) made encounters long and repetitive. Joystiq noted that the game emphasized combat over stealth. Kotaku called the combat <b>rating</b> <b>system</b> distracting screen clutter which broke the player's concentration, but GameFront said that the system was positive reinforcement for successful fights. The stealth sections were considered of similar quality to previous installments; their unchanged function left the methods of obtaining victory the same, making for a rote experience. The Remote Claw was criticized for making stealth sections too easy, allowing multiple enemies to be disabled without moving from the player's starting position.|$|E

At this point the committee redrafted the bill according to the terms agreed by the towns and it was passed by the House of Lords on 19 December 1908. Returned to the House of Commons the bill was passed by the Commons the same day, with Royal Assent being received on 21 December 1908. The Local Government Provisional Order (No. 3) Confirmation Act (8 Edw. 7 c.clxiv) came into force on 31 March 1910 with the new council consisting of 78 councillors representing 26 wards.

Wedgwood had previously been appointed acting mayor (primarily to act as returning officer for the first municipal elections) by the Local Government Board. So as not to show bias towards any of the six town halls, the council held its inaugural meeting at the North Stafford Hotel.
