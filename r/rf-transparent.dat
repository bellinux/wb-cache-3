An {{equipment}} cabinet contains e.g. power amplifiers, digital signal processors and backup batteries. What {{you can see}} {{by the side of}} a road or in a city center is just an antenna. However, the tendency nowadays is to camouflage the antenna (paint it the color of the building or put it into an <b>RF-transparent</b> enclosure). Smaller indoor nodes may have an antenna built into the cabinet door.|$|E
50|$|A {{satellite}} data unit (SDU) manufactured by Thales and branded TopConnect establishes a backhaul {{link to the}} ground through Inmarsat's SwiftBroadband geostationary satellite constellation operating in the L band around 1500 MHz which allows the use of electronically steerable antennas mounted atop the aircraft fuselage and encased within a fiberglass, <b>RF-transparent</b> radomethat have a low profile compared to systems operating in the Ku band or Ka band which today still require mechanically steerable antennas with a significantly higher profile. Thus drag and fuel costs are reduced allowing economical operation even on smaller aircraft like business or regional jets.Inmarsat's SwiftBroadband system covers much of the planet except for the polar regions above −82 and below +82 degrees latitude and currently provides symmetric data rates of up to 432 kbit/s per channel dependent on signal quality and overall load on the satellite's spotbeam serving the corresponding geographical area. Currently the Thales SDU can bond two channels resulting in a maximum bandwidth of 864 kbit/s.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} both {{theoretical}} and {{experimental studies of}} a photonic implementation of the electric (E-) field sensor using a probe made with all-dielectric <b>RF-transparent</b> elements. The geometrical dimensions of the electric field probe can be smaller than the wavelength of the measured electromagnetic field in the material. Our theoretical calculations show that the sensor allows detecting electric fields in a broad frequency range (100 Hz- 20 GHz) with sensitivity better than 1 μV/[Hz 1 / 2 m]. We demonstrate the sensor operating at X-band and validate the theoretical predictions...|$|E
40|$|An <b>RF-transparent</b> {{sunshield}} membrane covers {{an antenna}} reflector {{such as a}} parabolic dish. The blanket includes a single dielectric sheet of polyimide film 1 / 2 -mil thick. The surface of the film facing away from the reflector is coated with a transparent electrically conductive coating such as vapor-deposited indium-tin oxide. The surface of the film facing the reflector is reinforced by an adhesively attached polyester or glass mesh, {{which in turn is}} coated with a white paint. In a particular embodiment of the invention, polyurethane paint is used. In another embodiment of the invention, a layer of paint primer is applied to the mesh under a silicone paint, and the silicone paint is cured after application for several days at room temperature to enhance adhesion to the primer...|$|E
40|$|Automotive {{wireless}} communications have rapidly developed {{in recent years}} {{with the emergence of}} many new communications technologies. Only a couple of decades ago most vehicles were fitted with only one antenna for AM and FM radio reception. By comparison, today&# 039;s cars may be fitted with a multitude of antennas to communicate at many different frequencies {{for a wide variety of}} applications. This thesis proposes the use of wideband planar antennas in conjunction with polymeric composite panels to meet the communication requirements of vehicles both now and into the future. Sheet Moulding Compound (SMC) is a mature composite technology which is widely used in the automotive industry to form external car body panels by compression moulding. An SMC body panel could be utilized to create an <b>RF-transparent</b> aperture in a vehicle&# 039;s body structure. A wideband antenna could be attached to the underside of such a panel, or embedded into it during the compression moulding process. This would create a multifunctional antenna component which, when painted, would be indistinguishable from an ordinary section of bonnet, roof or trunk. The research presented in this thesis covers a variety of related topics. The electrical and mechanical properties of SMC are examined using various techniques. Optimal manufacturing process parameters are determined, which produce minimal deformation on an embedded antenna substrate during the compression moulding process. The effect of automotive paints on the impedance and radiation behaviour of planar antennas is determined by experimental means, including those paints which have a &# 039;metallic&# 039; effect. Two wideband antennas designed for vehicular use are proposed - the Optimised PICA and the WiPlaVe antenna. The antennas are low profile, fabricated on low-cost FR- 4 substrates, and provide an impedance match over a wide range of frequencies of interest in the automotive environment. A novel diplexer-divider-combiner device is presented. The device is implemented by exploiting Complimentary Split Ring Resonators, and improves the radiation performance of the WiPlaVe antenna at low frequencies. The overall performance of the proposed wideband vehicular antenna solution is validated by simulation and measurement in a variety of circumstances. A wideband antenna is embedded into the surface of an SMC ute tailgate component, and the radiation of the structure is characterized in an anechoic chamber. The effect of bending a wideband antenna is also evaluated by simulation and measurement. CST Microwave Studio&copy; is employed to simulate the O-PICA antenna on a full-size vehicle with an SMC roof panel. The same full-sized configuration is implemented in hardware with a GPS receiver. A comparison of the performance of the O-PICA antenna for GPS purposes is made against a commercial GPS patch antenna. The O-PICA antenna is found to provide comparable GPS performance with the commercial narrowband antenna, demonstrating the value of the integrated wideband vehicular antenna proposal...|$|E
