50|$|In 1923 {{she gave}} up {{teaching}} and worked at Osram as an industrial mathematician. Ellen Lax, who obtained her doctorate in 1919 under Walther Nernst, was Runge's colleague there.

50|$|In 1904, John Ambrose Fleming, {{the first}} {{professor}} of electrical Engineering at University College London, invented the first <b>radio</b> <b>tube,</b> the diode.

50|$|The first tube of the family, type 295, was {{introduced}} by Cable <b>Radio</b> <b>Tube</b> Corporation under the Speed label in March 1932. The company advertised 295 as being twice as powerful as the type 47 pentode, and three times as powerful as the type 45 directly heated triode (the most common output tube of the period) - hence the name triple-twin. Maximum output power reached 4,5 W at 5% distortion into 4 kOhm load; at 2 kOhm and 10 kOhm loads distortion increased to 8%. The 295 required +250 V plate voltage, and around +6 V positive grid bias.|$|E

5000|$|Rogers Vacuum Tube Company (formally named Radio Manufacturing Corporation Limited) {{was founded}} as [...] "Standard Radio Manufacturing" [...] in 1925 by Edward S.

5000|$|In 1925, Rogers Sr. {{invented the}} world's first {{alternating}} current (AC) heater filament cathode for a <b>radio</b> <b>tube,</b> which then enabled radios {{to be powered}} by ordinary transformer-coupled household electric current. This was a breakthrough in the technology and became {{a key factor in}} popularizing radio reception. After this invention radios became far more commonplace in the world. The All American Five {{is an example of a}} vacuum tube radio that utilized five tubes with heater filaments series-connected to produce a total AC voltage demand that matched the 120 volts AC supplied at the wall socket. No power transformers were needed in these radios ...|$|E
50|$|At {{first the}} {{audience}} consisted largely {{of young men}} tinkering with crystal sets.

In 1925 Edward Rogers invented a <b>radio</b> <b>tube</b> using AC current that immediately became a worldwide standard for much more powerful and easier-to-use radios. He set up the Rogers Majestic company to manufacture radios and established several broadcasting stations, including station 9RB (later CFRB, Toronto). By the late 1920s radio sets were easy to use and widely available. Although expensive, they opened up a much broader audience, attracting the middle class who could afford them, and also restaurants clubs and taverns, who wanted to attract customers. Even remote towns and localities could listen.|$|E

50|$|The NTRI {{was formed}} in 1922, and became fully {{operational}} in 1930. Located at Meguro, Tokyo, near the Tokyo Institute of Technology, first-rate scientists, engineers, and technicians were engaged in activities ranging from designing giant submarines to building new <b>radio</b> <b>tubes.</b> Included were all of the precursors of radar, but this {{did not mean that}} the heads of the Imperial Navy accepted these accomplishments.|$|R
50|$|The {{next step}} was to use thin {{platinum}} wire. Platinum is easily wetted by glass and has a similar coefficient of thermal expansion as typical soda-lime and lead glass. It is also easy to work with because of itsnon-oxidibility and high melting point. This type of seal was used in scientific equipment throughout the 19th century and also in the early incandescent lamps and <b>radio</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
50|$|One common {{noise source}} was a thermally-limited (saturated-emission) hot-cathode vacuum tube diode. These sources {{could serve as}} white noise {{generators}} from a few kilohertz through UHF and were available in normal <b>radio</b> <b>tube</b> glass envelopes. Flicker (1/f) noise limited application at lower frequencies; electron transit time limited application at higher frequencies. The basic design was a diode vacuum tube with a heated filament. The temperature of the cathode (filament) sets the anode (plate) current that determines the shot noise; see Richardson equation. The anode voltage is set large enough to collect all the electrons emitted by the filament. If the plate voltage were too low, {{then there would be}} space charge near the filament that would affect the noise output. For a calibrated generator, care must be taken so that the shot noise dominates the thermal noise of the tube's plate resistance and other circuit elements.|$|E
50|$|Germany {{has a long}} {{heritage}} of using electromagnetic waves for detecting objects. In 1888, Heinrich Hertz, who first demonstrated {{the existence of these}} waves, also noted that they, like light, were reflected by metal surfaces. In 1904, Christian Hülsmeyer obtained German and foreign patents for an apparatus, the Telemobilskop, using a spark gap transmitter that could detect ships and prevent collisions; this is often cited as the first radar, but, without directly providing range, it does not qualify for this classification. With the advent of the <b>radio</b> <b>tube</b> and electronics, other detection-only systems were developed, but all used continuous waves and could not measure distance. In 1933, physicist Rudolf Kühnhold, Scientific Director at the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) Nachrichtenmittel-Versuchsanstalt (NVA—Experimental Institute of Communication Systems) in Kiel, initiated experiments in the microwave region to measure the distance to a target. For the transmitter, he obtained assistance from two radio amateur operators, Paul-Günther Erbslöh and Hans-Karl Freiherr von Willisen. In January 1934, they formed at Berlin-Oberschöneweide the company Gesellschaft für Elektroakustische und Mechanische Apparate (GEMA) for this work.|$|E
5000|$|The EF50 was {{preceded by}} RCA's acorn design and several other attempts, such as the “Stahlröhre” from Telefunken, to reduce {{inductance}} in the wire leads, all with some disadvantages. Philips had been working since 1934/5 on an alternative that would {{solve the problems of}} the other bases, and a design that could be produced cheaply and in large quantities. A presentation given by M.J.O. Strutt from the tube development group at Philips Research at the first “Internationale Fernseh-Tagung in Zürich” (international television conference in Zürich) described their work in September 1938. A few months later Professor J.L.H. Jonker, who had {{a leading role in the}} development of the EF50, published an internal Philips Research Technical Note, Titled: “New <b>radio</b> <b>Tube</b> Constructions”. Jonker's role was confirmed decades later by Th.P.Tromp, head of radio-valve manufacturing and production: [...] "Prof. Dr. Jonker (head of development lab of electronic valves in the mid thirties) was the originator of the EF50 and this development started already as far back as 1934/1935. It was indeed developed in view of possible television application." ...|$|E
25|$|During World War I. Chief Signal Officer George Owen Squier {{worked closely}} with private {{industry}} to perfect <b>radio</b> <b>tubes</b> while creating a major signal laboratory at Camp Alfred Vail (Fort Monmouth). Early radiotelephones developed by the Signal Corps were introduced into the European theater in 1918. While the new American voice radios were superior to the radiotelegraph sets, telephone and telegraph remained the major technology of World War I.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the seventies Norbert Krueler used simple <b>radio</b> <b>tubes,</b> a microphone and a regular acoustic guitar to create new effect sounds. A local concert promoter became aware of the young artist and enables him to support many acts of popular German Krautrock bands like Grobschnitt, King Pin Meh, Birth Control and Kraan. As music clubs boomed at the same time, Norbert swapped the live stage for a DJ stand for financial reasons.|$|R
50|$|A <b>tube</b> <b>radio</b> or <b>tube</b> {{amplifier}} {{will increase}} in volume to a point, {{and then as}} the input signal extends beyond the linear range of the device, the effective gain is reduced, altering {{the shape of the}} waveform. The effect is also present in transistor circuits. The extent of the effect depends on the topology of the amplifier.|$|R
