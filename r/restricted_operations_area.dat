40|$|Should {{companies}} invest {{at all in}} countries, like China, where severe {{human rights}} abuses are pervasive? If they do invest, should they <b>restrict</b> their <b>operations</b> to <b>areas</b> {{of the country that}} have a comparatively good human rights record? Are there basic principles that transnational companies should observe to ensure, at a minimum, that they do not become complicit in a host government 2 ̆ 7 s abrogation of universally-recognized human rights? Should such principles be enforced by Executive or congressional fiat, or should companies take primary responsibility for policing themselves? How can companies that wish to factor human rights considerations into their business decisions be assured that they will not pay a price in lost investment opportunities or reduced market share? This article addresses these questions in light of relevant principles of international law and U. S. foreign policy. A central thesis of this article is that businesses that may or do invest in China bear a responsibility to ensure that their actions do not, however inadvertently, contribute to the systematic denial of human rights in the PRC. We believe, moreover, that international human rights law provides an objective basis for identifying those responsibilities...|$|R

40|$|A new {{generation}} of mobile robots has recently been designed based on the successful hardware and software architecture of Care-O-bot [2]. The robots have been created to communicate with and to entertain visitors in a museum. Their tasks include welcoming visitors, leading a guided tour in the museum, or playing with a ball. Keywords: Mobile Robot, Museum Robots, Self Localization, Obstacle Avoidance, Communication HARDWARE PLATFORM Fig. 1 Basic platform and "fully dressed" museum robot (Museumsstiftung Post und Kommunikation) Each vehicle is equipped with two driven wheels (differential drive) including shaft encoders for motion tracking. The robots are able to move at a speed of up to 1. 2 m/s. Four castor wheels are further used for keeping the robots upright. A gyroscope is integrated in the robot platforms to track their current orientations. A 2 D laser scanner {{is attached to the}} front of each robot. It is used for self localization, navigation, and obstacle detection. Additional safety sensors are a bumper {{at the bottom of the}} robots and several infrared sensors which are integrated in the bumper facing upwards. These sensors are used to detect obstacles above the scanning level of the laser scanner. Activating one of the safety sensors as well as pressing either of the emergency stop buttons results in an immediate stop. Besides software <b>restricting</b> the allowed <b>operation</b> <b>area,</b> a magnetic sensor facing towards the ground is used as a secondary system to prevent the robots from leaving their assigned area. This area is bounded by a magnetic band lowered in the ground. Being equipped with several long lasting batteries the robots are able to move independently for up to ten hours without interruption.
