40|$|A {{computer}} simulation {{was conducted to}} investigate the effectiveness of profile modification for reducing dynamic loads in gears with different tooth <b>spacing</b> <b>errors.</b> The simulation examined varying amplitudes of <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> and differences {{in the span of}} teeth over which the error occurs. The modification considered included both linear and parabolic tip relief. The analysis considered <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> that varies around most of the gear circumference (similar to a typical sinusoidal error pattern) as well as a shorter span of <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> that occurs on only a few teeth. The dynamic analysis was performed using a revised version of a NASA gear dynamics code, modified to add tooth <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> to the analysis. Results obtained from the investigation show that linear tip relief is more effective in reducing dynamic loads on gears with small <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> but parabolic tip relief becomes more effective as the amplitude of <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> increases. In addition, the parabolic modification is more effective for the more severe error case where the error is spread over a longer span of teeth. The findings of this study can be used to design robust tooth profile modification for improving dynamic performance of gear sets with different tooth <b>spacing</b> <b>errors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Coherent field imaging {{is based}} on the {{assumption}} of equal transmitting apertures spacing and equal spectrum of laser, and high-resolution image is reconstructed by iteratively computing the frequency spectrum. However, the inevitable transmitting aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> of laser is a key factor to affect the coherent field imaging quality in the application. Aiming at the problem of degrading imaging quality caused by the transmitting aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error,</b> we discuss the mechanism of influence of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> on imaging quality and propose a novel method of improving imaging quality from the perspective of suppressing the influence of transmitting aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error.</b> Firstly, the mechanism of the influence of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> on imaging quality and laser echo spectrum is analyzed in detail. Then we derive a frequency spectrum error propagation model. Based on the model, the iterative effect of frequency spectrum error is investigated and the trend of variation in imaging quality with frequency spectrum error is given. We propose a theoretical equation, in which the transmitting aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> has no influence on frequency spectrum nor imaging quality. To solve the above equation, an optimized method of linear programming is proposed and the optimized matrix of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> is obtained. In practice, the influence of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> on imaging quality can be largely counteracted by reasonably allocating aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> according to the optimized <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> matrix. The correctness and validity of the theoretical model are verified by a simulation experiment. The results show that the Strehl ratio of imaging quality index can be improved by about 100 % through using the proposed method, the greater the aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error,</b> the higher the Strehl ratio of imaging quality index obtained by the method will be. In addition, the method is easy to use practically and less costly as well. Finally, it is concluded that the proposed method can easily and effectively counteract the degrading effect of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> on imaging quality. The research can provide a theoretical basis for improving imaging quality and reasonably assigning transmitter aperture spacing accuracy of coherent field imaging telescope...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} non-transport {{functions}} of the <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> generated by elevated transport infrastructure and its relationship with abutting neighborhoods The space under the Chicago Brown Line, among all other elevated train lines, is often considered as an undesirable and useless urban eyesore. As part of the transit authority's right of way, such space is usually labeled "mass transportation corridor" on planner's land use maps. However, more careful observations reveal that a considerable portion of the land underneath the train tracks has been actively used by the adjacent residents or business owners {{for a variety of}} purposes other than providing transit service. These observations place an interesting question mark on the stubborn negative common perception of the <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> associated with the elevated train lines and other large scale transport infrastructure: why the fact that such <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> is actually being used cannot change the notion that it is not usable? By categorizing the observed activities under the Brown Line into private, quasi-public, and public use types, it is clear that most of the spontaneous reclamation actions are intended for private activities. (cont.) This in a sense indicates that private activities have limited contribution to the entire image of the social character of the <b>residual</b> <b>space.</b> Analysis of the physical characteristics of the <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> shows that although the physical condition of a given plot of <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> does not determine the occurrence of activities on it, the quality of the physical environment is an important factor {{of the quality of the}} social activity. Therefore, this thesis argues that one effective way to reclaim the <b>residual</b> <b>spaces</b> both physically and psychologically is to showcase a series of key projects that transform them into delightful places well-programmed for public/quasi-public activities. Following this argument, the main body of the thesis explores strategies of reclaiming the <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> by presenting cases of similar practice in other places and proposing implementation prototypes designed for the Brown Line. The lessons learned from the case studies and the design exercises are conceptualized into guidelines that cover a broad range of considerations from engaging participants, programming activities to spatial design and temporal planning. (cont.) In all, this thesis attempts to provide alternative view points for the transit authority to upgrade, manage, and maintain its right of way, to urge city planners to look into flexible and overlapped land use patterns, and to express my strong belief in good urban environment. by Jing Su.

This paper investigates the properties and effects of these two kinds of error on 2 D resistivity imaging or inversion for practical applications. By analytic analysis and numerical simula-tions, the off-line and in-line electrode <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> were quantitatively estimated for all common electrode arrays (pole-pole, pole-dipole, pole-bipole, Wenner, Schlumberger, dipole-dipole, γ-array,Wenner-β) in 2 D resistivity imaging surveys.

However, very {{little research has been}} investigated the relative performance of different interpolation methods in meteorological data of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). Actually, it has importantly practical significance to as far as possibly improve the accuracy of interpolation results for meteorological data, especially in mountainous Xinjiang. There- fore, this paper focuses on the performance of different spatial interpolation methods for monthly temperature data in Xinjiang. The daily observed data of temperature are collected from 38 meteorological stations for the period 1960 - 2004. Inverse distance weighting (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), temperature lapse rate method (TLR) and multiple linear regressions (MLR) are selected as interpolated methods. Two rasterized methods, multiple regression plus <b>space</b> <b>residual</b> <b>error</b> and directly interpolated observed temperature (DIOT) data, are used to analyze and compare the performance of these interpolation methods respectively. Moreover, cross-validation is used to evaluate the performance of different spatial interpolation methods. The results are as follows: 1) The method of DIOT is unsuitable for the study area in this paper. 2) It is important to process the observed data by local regression model before the spatial interpolation. 3) The MLR-IDW is the optimum spatial interpolation method for the monthly mean temperature based on cross-validation.

40|$|Most NLP {{applications}} {{work under}} the assumption that a user input is error-free; thus, word segmentation (WS) for written languages that use word boundary markers (WBMs), such as spaces, has been regarded as a trivial issue. However, noisy real-world texts, such as blogs, e-mails, and SMS, may contain <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> that require correction before further processing may take place. For the Korean language, many researchers have adopted a traditional WS approach, which eliminates all spaces in the user input and re-inserts proper word boundaries. Unfortunately, such an approach often exacerbates the word spacing quality for user input, which has few or no spacing errors; such is the case, because a perfect WS model does not exist. In this paper, we propose a novel WS method that takes into consideration the initial word spacing information of the user input. Our method generates a better output than the original user input, even if the user input has few <b>spacing</b> <b>errors.</b> Moreover, the proposed method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art Korean WS model when the user input initially contains less than 10 % <b>spacing</b> <b>errors,</b> and performs comparably for cases containing more <b>spacing</b> <b>errors.</b> We believe that the proposed method will be a very practical pre-processing module. ...|$|R

Methods Twenty-six patients underwent thoracoplasty in the last 10 years with the aim of obliterating a <b>residual</b> pleural <b>space</b> or pulmonary cavity. Twenty-one patients had a postresectional empyema, 3 had a primary empyema and 2 had a cavernostomy performed for a pulmonary aspergilloma. A bronchopleural fistula was present in 10 cases. Infection had been previously controlled in all cases by intercostal drainage, open-window thoracostomy, or cavernostomy (in 4, 20, and 2 patients, respectively). Twenty-two extramuscoloperiosteal thoracoplasties, 3 thoracomyoplasties, and 1 Andrews thoracoplasty were performed. Intrathoracic flap transposition followed thoracoplasty in 9 cases; a second step of the Clagett procedure followed thoracoplasty in 2 cases. Results One patient died postoperatively (3. 8 %). Thoracoplasty alone (n = 6) or combined with a procedure to fill the <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> (n = 14) was successful in achieving complete obliteration of the <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> in 77 % of patients (n = 20). In 4 patients thoracoplasty alone reduced the residual cavity but filling procedures were not feasible. In 1 patient thoracoplasty failed to obliterate the cavity and infection recurred.

Conclusions Thoracoplasty remains an option for the treatment of residual pleural or pulmonary spaces (with or without bronchopleural fistula) once infection has been controlled, when other more conservative procedures are not effective or feasible.
