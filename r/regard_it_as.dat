5|$|Unbreakable was {{released}} on November 22, 2000. It received positive reviews, with critics praising its aesthetics, the performances and particularly the score by James Newton Howard. The film has subsequently gained a strong cult following. Many <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> one of Shyamalan's best films, and in 2011 Time listed the film {{as one of the}} top ten superhero movies of all time.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Russian {{declaration}} of war {{came as a surprise}} to both Carol and Kogălniceanu, who had not been informed of the exact date (April 23) when the Imperial Russian Army would start moving into Moldavia—hence, Romanians tended to <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an invasion. Also alarming for Kogălniceanu, the official Russian proclamation addressed Romanians as protegés of the Empire. Bilateral tensions were somewhat alleviated by Russian apologies and, later, by the Ottoman pledge to annex Romania; addressing a discontented Parliament, Kogălniceanu asserted that the Russian road was the country's only choice.|$|E
5|$|Ingres' {{portrait}} of Bertin {{was a critical}} and popular success, but the sitter was a private person. Although his family worried about caricature and disapproved, it became widely known and sealed the artist's reputation. It was praised at the Paris Salon of 1833, and has been influential to both academic painters such as Léon Bonnat and later modernists including Pablo Picasso and Félix Vallotton. Today art critics <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> Ingres' finest male portrait. It has been on permanent display at the Musée du Louvre since 1897.|$|E

5|$|The film grew {{a strong}} following, which {{expanded}} overseas in the 1980s, and has established {{itself as a}} cult classic. Film critics and enthusiasts now <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an absurdist masterpiece. It has been cited as an influence by filmmakers such as Jim Jarmusch, John Woo, Chan-wook Park and Quentin Tarantino, and composer John Zorn. Thirty-four years after Branded to Kill, Suzuki filmed Pistol Opera (2001) with Nikkatsu, a loose sequel to the former. The company has also hosted two major retrospectives spotlighting his career.|$|E
5|$|An Indian Mughal {{painting}} rediscovered in St. Petersburg in the 1950s shows a dodo {{along with}} native Indian birds. It depicts a slimmer, brownish bird, and its discoverer A. Iwanow and dodo specialist Julian Hume <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the}} most accurate depictions of the living dodo; the surrounding birds are clearly identifiable and depicted with appropriate colouring. It is believed to be from the 17th century and has been attributed to artist Ustad Mansur. The bird depicted probably lived in the menagerie of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, located in Surat, where English traveller Peter Mundy also claimed to have seen dodos. In 2014, another Indian illustration of a dodo was reported, but it was found to be derivative of an 1836 German illustration.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{similarities}} between Pithecanthropus erectus (Java Man) and Sinanthropus pekinensis (Peking Man) led Ernst Mayr to rename both Homo erectus in 1950, placing them {{directly in the}} human evolutionary tree. To distinguish Java Man from other Homo erectus populations, some scientists began to <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a subspecies, Homo erectus erectus, in the 1970s. Other fossils found {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century in Java at Sangiran and Mojokerto, all older than those found by Dubois, are also considered part of the species Homo erectus. Estimated to be between 700,000 and 1,000,000 years old, at the time of their discovery the fossils of Java Man were the oldest hominin fossils ever found. The fossils of Java Man have been housed at the Naturalis in the Netherlands since 1900.|$|E

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war the Arctic front remained stale. The German High Command did not <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an important theatre and therefore refrained from transferring the substantial reinforcements needed for a renewal of the offensive. The Finns likewise were not interested in continuing the offensive on their own as {{they did not want to}} antagonize the Western Allies further. In September 1944, following a series of devastating German defeats, the Finns sued for peace with the Soviet Union and had to give up all their territorial conquests. The Germans subsequently retreated from Central Finland to Petsamo and Norway. In October 1944, the Red Army conducted the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation and achieved a decisive victory over the German forces in the Arctic by completely expelling them from Finland.|$|E
5|$|French {{paleontologist}} Eric Buffetaut and a Thai colleague, Varavudh Suteethorn, {{described a}} partial {{upper and lower}} jaw from the Aptian-Albian Khok Kruat Formation of Thailand in 1992, giving it the name Psittacosaurus sattayaraki. In 2000, Sereno questioned the validity of this species, citing its eroded and fragmentary nature, and noted an absence of features characteristic of the genus Psittacosaurus. However, in 2002 the original authors published new images of the fossil which seem to show teeth in the lower jaw that exhibit the bulbous vertical ridge characteristic of psittacosaurs. Other authors have also defended its validity, while some continue to <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> dubious. Sereno (2010) proposed that the best assignment for the type material may be Ceratopsia incertae sedis.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long promulgated a {{new legal}} code {{to replace the}} system that had existed since the Hong Duc era of Lê Thánh Tông in the 15th century. Work started in 1811 under a group of {{scholars}} led by Nguyễn Văn Thành, and in 1815, the Bộ luật Gia Long (Gia Long Code) was issued. Although Gia Long claimed that his new system {{was a mixture of}} the Le code and Qing Dynasty system of China, most scholars <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> being a near complete copy of the Qing code. The code was later translated into French by Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre. It focused on strengthening the power and authority of the emperor, his mandarins, and the traditional family unit. In cases of serious crimes, particularly those against the state, collective punishment was meted out to the family of the convict, including the death penalty.|$|E

5|$|Noted {{for its use}} {{of sample}} loop and {{utilizing}} swing note and synthesized percussion throughout its production, the album encompasses a variety of musical styles, such as new jack swing, hard rock, pop, dance and industrial music. The songs range from mechanized dance rhythms to soft balladry, giving it appeal across multiple radio formats. It became the singer's second consecutive album to skyrocket to {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States. Certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it became the country's best-selling album of 1990 and has sold an estimated 12 million copies worldwide. Due to its innovative production and lyrical exploration, critics have come to <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the pinnacle of Jackson's artistic achievement. It has been cited as an influence in various musical trends, inspiring numerous artists.|$|E
5|$|Small {{numbers of}} frill sharks are caught {{incidentally}} by various deepwater commercial fisheries around the world, using trawls, gillnets, and longlines. In particular, it is regularly taken in Suruga Bay in bottom gillnets meant for sea bream and gnomefish, and in midwater trawls {{meant for the}} shrimp Sergia lucens. Japanese fishermen <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a nuisance, as it damages the nets. This shark is sometimes sold for meat or processed into fishmeal, but is not economically significant. Because of its very low reproductive rate and the continuing expansion of commercial fisheries into its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has previously listed it as Near Threatened, although the species was downlisted to Least Concern in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{milk shark}} is {{harmless}} to humans {{because of its}} small size and teeth. Caught using longlines, gillnets, trawls, and hook-and-line, this shark is marketed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, and is also used for shark fin soup and fishmeal. Its abundance makes it a significant component of artisanal and commercial fisheries across its range. Off northern Australia, it ranks among the most common sharks caught in trawls, and comprises 2% and 6% of the annual gillnet and longline catches, respectively. This species {{is also one of}} the most commercially important sharks caught off Senegal, Mauritania, Oman, and India. Some sport fishers <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a game fish.|$|E

5|$|Two {{varieties}} {{have been}} described. Chalciporus piperatus var. hypochryseus was originally described as Boletus hypochryseus by Czech mycologist Josef Šutara in 1993, and {{was moved to}} Chalciporus a year later by Regis Courtecuisse. Wolfgang Klofac and Irmgard Krisai-Greilhuber reclassified it as a variety of C.piperatus in 2006, although some sources continue to <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a distinct species. Variety amarellus, first published by Quélet as Boletus amarellus in 1883 and later transferred to Chalciporus by Bataille in 1908, {{was described as a}} variety of C.piperatus in 1974 by Albert Pilát and Aurel Dermek. Authorities disagree {{as to whether or not}} it has independent taxonomic significance.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} play in the Lancashire League in England during the Australian winter of 1952, joining Nelson Cricket Club for a sum of 600 pounds and bonuses, which did not include the boat fares for him and his wife. Lindwall took 96 wickets at 8.37 during the season and developed an inswinger on the advice of a local umpire who adamantly refused to give leg before wicket decisions to outswingers. Lindwall returned to Australia with a newborn son who has been born during his stay in Lancashire, and he was greeted by media speculation as to whether his professional sojourn had improved or detracted from his capabilities. Lindwall's form leading into the Tests against South Africa in 1952–53 prompted observers to opine that he was bowling better than ever, reinforced with the inswinger and his trademark Yorker. Lindwall made 70 from a total of 148 on a sticky wicket against South Australia in Adelaide that led Miller to <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the best innings he had seen under such conditions. He made the score after being sent in to open the batting in the absence of Sid Barnes.|$|E
5|$|Syme {{argued that}} {{it was a mistake to}} <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a {{historical}} work at all and that no clear propaganda purpose could be determined. He theorized that the History is primarily a literary product – an exercise in satire produced by a 'rogue scholiast' catering to (and making fun of or parodying) the antiquarian tendencies of the Theodosian age, in which Suetonius and Marius Maximus were fashionable reading and Ammianus Marcellinus was producing sober history in the manner of Tacitus. (The History implausibly makes the Emperor Tacitus (275–276) a descendant and connoisseur of the historian). In fact in a passage on the Quadriga tyrannorum — the 'four-horse chariot of usurpers' said to have aspired to the purple in the reign of Probus — the History itself accuses Marius Maximus of being a producer of 'mythical history': homo omnium verbosissimus, qui et mythistoricis se voluminibis implicavit ('the most long-winded of men, who furthermore wrapped himself up in volumes of historical fiction'). The term mythistoricis occurs nowhere else in Latin. Of considerable significance in this regard is the opening section of the life of Aurelian, in which 'Flavius Vopiscus' records a supposed conversation he had with the City Prefect of Rome during the festival of Hilaria in which the Prefect urges him to write as he chooses and invent what he does not know.|$|E
