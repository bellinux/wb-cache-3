5|$|The {{first week}} {{stabbing}} was <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> to the Murder of Jonathan Levin. ABC sent the media {{the first two}} episodes prior to the season 6 premiere. In the first episode, Smits is both stabbed and inadvertently cut by his dentist. Based {{on the first two}} episodes, Dave Matheny and Neal Justin of the Star Tribune determined that Simone would endure a worsening mysterious illness. In the third episode of the arc, Smits was hospitalized and in need of a heart transplant. The fourth episode was a buildup to impending heart surgery as he struggles with cardiomyopathy.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the two moons is not well understood. Their low albedo and {{carbonaceous}} chondrite composition have been <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> to asteroids, supporting the capture theory. The unstable orbit of Phobos would seem to point towards a relatively recent capture. But both have circular orbits, near the equator, which is unusual for captured objects and the required capture dynamics are complex. Accretion early {{in the history of}} Mars is plausible, but would not account for a composition resembling asteroids rather than Mars itself, if that is confirmed.|$|E

Ingrasci is now President of the Hoffman Institute which offers {{programs such as the}} Hoffman Quadrinity Process which some <b>regard</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> to Lifespring.|$|R
50|$|Wolfe sends Saul {{to bring}} Julie Jaquette. When she dances into Wolfe's office, Miss Jaquette {{puts on a}} performance, first singing and then {{demanding}} to see Wolfe's orchids. She displays a cynicism regarding human behavior that Wolfe <b>regards</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> to his own. Julie agrees to act as bait for the murderer and is nearly killed herself. For her protection, she is moved into the brownstone, where she helps Wolfe and Archie force Thales' hand after Wolfe offers $50,000 cash for her assistance.|$|R
50|$|The {{compulsory}} {{nature of}} Australian Superannuation {{means that it}} is sometimes <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> being <b>similar</b> to social security taxes levied in other nations. This is more frequently the case when comparisons are being made between the tax burden of respective nations.|$|R
25|$|In 1959, Belgium {{reversed}} its {{stance and}} allowed the majority Hutu to assume {{control of the government}} through universal elections after independence. This partly reflected internal Belgian domestic politics, in which the discrimination against the Hutu majority came to be <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> to oppression within Belgium stemming from the Flemish-Walloon conflict, and the democratization and empowerment of the Hutu was seen as a just response to the Tutsi domination. Belgian policies wavered and flip-flopped considerably during this period leading up to independence of Burundi and Rwanda.|$|E
25|$|In England and Wales, {{the law of}} arms is {{regarded}} {{as a part of the}} laws of England, and the common law courts will take judicial notice of it as such. These dignities, as they are called, have legal standing. But the law of arms is not part of the common law and the common law Courts have no jurisdiction over matters of dignities and honours, such as armorial bearings, or peerages. In this respect the law of arms was most influenced by the civil law and may be <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> to the ecclesiastical law, which is a part of the laws of England influenced by canon law, but not part of the common law.|$|E
500|$|French naturalist Michel Gandoger {{described}} four taxa in 1919 that he <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> to (but distinct from) I.anethifolius. I.confertus was a plant from Rylstone on the Central Tablelands, {{which he}} distinguished by its crowded leaves that were [...] long. I.eriophorus was a plant with more scattered leaves that were [...] long. He described I.globosus from the Port Jackson district {{on the basis}} of round (rather than oval) infructescences (cones), and I.virgatulus from Western Australia. All four were subsequently synonymised with I.anethifolius. Gandoger described 212 taxa of Australian plants, almost all of {{which turned out to be}} species already described.|$|E

2500|$|Since all of {{existence}} emanates from God, whose ultimate existence is {{not dependent on}} anything else, some Jewish sages perceived God as interpenetrating the universe, which itself has been {{thought to be a}} manifestation of God's existence. In this way Judaism can be <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> being <b>similar</b> to [...] panentheism, while always affirming genuine monotheism.|$|R
5000|$|Richmond had {{a strong}} spiritual sense, <b>regarding</b> {{painting}} <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> to prayer, and nurtured a lifelong determination never to become {{what he called a}} [...] "dealer's artist". A month before his death he published a letter in The Guardian very critical of a materialistic ethos in contemporary western art, provoked by the auction at Sotheby's of work by Damien Hirst.|$|R

2500|$|The psalm verse uses a [...] "pulsed tone" [...] technique, with a {{variable}} number of syllables between the main pulses (barlines). Each line has a prescribed number of accented syllables, {{even though the}} total number of syllables varies from line to line. In that sense, it may be <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> to the song Three Blind Mice: each line contains the same number of bars (pulses), but the number of syllables varies from three ("Three blind mice") to eleven [...] "Did ever you see such a thing in your life". But unlike that song, Gelineau insists [...] "the words must never be allowed to fall into set musical rhythmical patterns which are opposed to the natural relative lengths of their syllables when correctly spoken." [...] It is thus a form of sprung rhythm.|$|E

5000|$|Nepenthes ramispina ( [...] ; from Latin: ramus = branch, spina = spine, spur) is a {{highland}} Nepenthes pitcher plant species, {{native to}} Peninsular Malaysia. It was once <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> being <b>similar</b> to N. gracillima, but {{studies of the}} two species in nature have shown that they are readily distinguishable in isolation, N. gracillima being far more readily confused with N. macfarlanei in its rosette stage.|$|R
50|$|The Great Plains is {{the broad}} expanse of prairie and steppe which lies {{east of the}} Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. The narrow plains in the Mexican coast and the savannas of the Mississippi are {{analogous}} to, respectively, the Patagonian steppes and the pampas of the Piranha, Paraguay, and Rio de la Plata. Thus the Appalachians and the mountain chains of Brazil are <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> creating <b>similar</b> interruptions to the plains community.|$|R
5000|$|These {{plants have}} various uses {{that have been}} {{realized}} throughout history. The three species in the genus are generally <b>regarding</b> <b>as</b> possessing <b>similar</b> properties. [...] This plant is occasionally used in woodland gardens as an ornamental. Children {{should not be allowed}} to eat the attractive blue fruits, as these plants contain chemicals that are known to cause cell damage. The powdered roots have been shown to cause dermatitis and irritation of the mucous membranes.|$|R

50|$|The {{figure to}} the right {{illustrates}} the concept of co-citation and a more recent variation of co-citation which accounts for the placement of citations in {{the full text of}} documents. The figure's left image shows the Documents A and B, which are both cited by Documents C, D and E; thus Documents A and B have a co-citation strength, or co-citation index of three. This score is usually established using citation indexes. Documents featuring high numbers of co-citations are <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> more <b>similar.</b>|$|R
50|$|A metaphysical {{issue which}} crops up in multiverse {{theories}} that posit infinite identical copies {{of any given}} universe, {{is the notion that}} there can be identical objects in different possible worlds. According to the counterpart theory of David Lewis, the objects should be <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> rather than identical.|$|E
50|$|Topologically, {{a regular}} 2-dimensional {{tessellation}} may be <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> to a (3-dimensional) polyhedron, but {{such that the}} angular defect is zero. Thus, Schläfli symbols may also be defined for regular tessellations of Euclidean or hyperbolic space {{in a similar way}} as for polyhedra. The analogy holds for higher dimensions.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{appropriated}} to {{the maintenance}} of certain defininte persons, mensal property is nevertheless church property, and its administrator is bound to observe the canonical rules concerning it. As to the administration strictly speaking, he must keep the property in good condition and execute all works expedient to that end; in short, he must act like a good head of a household. But he cannot do anything that would infringe upon proprietary rights, for he is not the proprietor: any alienation, or any contract which the law <b>regards</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> to alienation, is forbidden him, excepting under prescribed juridical formalities, under pain of excommunication (Extrav. Ambitiosæ, [...] "De reb. eccl. non alienandis"; see also [...] ). The chief of these prescribed formalities is the Apostolic authorization, given either directly or by Indult, and that only when the alienation or similar contract is to the advantage of the Church. For the alienation of mensal property, or for making any similar contract, the bishop is, in particular, bound to safeguard himself with the consent of the chapter (S. C. Concilii, 25 July 1891).|$|R

Papaver orientale 'Beauty of Livermere' is <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> so <b>similar</b> to, if not identical with, the wild P. bracteatum that it may well be a strain of P. bracteatum {{or at the very least}} a complex hybrid derived from it in large part.|$|R
40|$|International audienceExtra-thoracic solitary fibrous tumours (ESFT) have {{traditionally}} been <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> indolent neoplasms <b>similar</b> to their intra-thoracic counterparts.

50|$|In 1959, Nintendo {{struck a}} deal with Disney to allow the use Disney's {{characters}} on Nintendo's playing cards. Previously, Western playing cards were <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> something <b>similar</b> to hanafuda and mahjong: a device for gambling. By tying playing cards to Disney and selling books explaining the different games one could play with the cards, Nintendo could sell the product to Japanese households. The tie-in was a success and the company sold at least 600,000 card packs in a single year. Due to this success, in 1962, Yamauchi took Nintendo public, listing the company in Osaka Stock Exchange Second division.|$|R
