40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel repeater insertion algorithm for interconnect power minimization. The novelty of our ap-proach {{is in the}} judicious integration of an analytical solver and a dynamic programming based method. Specifically, the analytical solver chooses a concise repeater library and a small set of <b>repeater</b> <b>location</b> candidates such that the dy-namic programming algorithm can be performed fast with little degradation of the solution quality. In comparison with previously reported repeater insertion schemes, within com-parable runtimes, our approach achieves up to 37 % higher power savings.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{selecting}} repeater sizes and inserting at feasible locations in a placed and routed network to meet delay constraints using minimal repeater area, taking the advantage of slacks available in the network. Specifically, we transform the problem into an unconstrained optimization problem and solve it by iterative local refinement. We show that the optimal <b>repeater</b> <b>locations</b> and sizes that locally minimize the objective function in the unconstrained problem can be efficiently computed. We have implemented our algorithm and tested it on a set of benchmarks; the experimental results are promising...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of placing radio repeaters to serve users in an area. Given a population distribution and geographical map, we use a hill-climbing algorithm to find a minimum number of repeaters required to cover an area and then a genetic algorithm to provide maximal population coverage and net-work connectedness. We then use hill-climbing techniques to allocate subnetworks based on population size at <b>repeater</b> <b>locations</b> so that two arbitrary users can com-municate even when all other users are communicating over {{the maximum number of}} possible networks. Our resulting algorithm is capable of producing a range of re-peater network allocations, from robust networks that are capable of handling worst-case usage scenarios to smaller networks that provide optimal population coverage and connectivity. On a set of real-world population and geography data, we found that the combination of the hill-climbing and genetic algorithms had 28 % better population coverage than a control algorithm did, as well as higher connectivity...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{repeater}} block planning algorithm for interconnect-centric floorplanning. We introduce the concept of independent feasible regions for repeaters and derive an analytical formula for their computation. We develop a routability-driven repeater clustering algorithm to perform repeater block planning based on iterative deletion. The goal is to obtain a high quality solution for the <b>repeater</b> block <b>locations</b> so that performance-driven interconnect synthesis at the routing stage {{can be carried out}} with ease, while minimizing the chip area. Experimental results show that our method increases the percentage of all global nets that meet their target delays from 67. 5 % in [1] to 85 %. Moreover, our approach minimizes the expected routing congestion, making it easier for performance-driven routers to synthesize global nets that require the insertion of repeaters to meet timing constraints...|$|R

40|$|Our task is {{to develop}} a model that determines how to {{minimally}} and adequately place VHF repeaters so that low-power users, such as mobile stations, can communicate with one another in situations where direct user-to-user contact would not be possible. We assume that we are given a population of users within a circular region of radius 40 miles, and we attempt to find the minimal number of repeaters necessary to provide adequate coverage while minimizing the number of radio bands in use and keeping interference negligible. Although we assume that there must be a direct line of sight between a repeater and a user, our model allows for terrains of complex geometry including mountains and valleys. Throughout most of our analysis, we assume that repeater antennas are 18 feet above the ground, which corresponds to a coverage radius of 10 miles in a perfectly flat region. Initially, we employ a greedy algorithm to successively place <b>repeaters</b> in the <b>locations</b> that provide coverage to the most additional users. In subsequent incarnations of the model, we consider goals other than maximal coverage in selecting the optimal positions. To assign frequency channels to these repeaters we form a graph whose vertices represent the repeaters, and we consider vertices to be adjacent if the repeaters are sufficiently clos...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We present new {{millimeter}} {{and infrared}} spectroscopic observations towards the radio nebula G 10. 0 − 0. 3, which {{is powered by}} the wind of the Luminous Blue Variable star LBV 1806 − 20 also {{closely associated with the}} soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 1806 − 20, and believed to be located in the giant Galactic H ii complex W 31. Based on observations of CO emission lines and NH 3 absorption features from molecular clouds along the line of sight to G 10. 0 − 0. 3, as well as the radial velocity and optical extinction of the star powering the nebula, we determine its distance to be 15. 1 + 1. 8 − 1. 3 kpc in agreement with Corbel et al. (1997). In addition, this strengthens the association of SGR 1806 − 20 with a massive molecular cloud at the same distance. All soft gamma-ray <b>repeaters</b> with precise <b>location</b> are now found to be associated with a site of massive star formation or molecular cloud.
