5|$|There are {{currently}} about 230 tropical botanical gardens with a concentration in southern and south-eastern Asia. The first botanical garden {{founded in the}} tropics was the Pamplemousses Botanical Garden in Mauritius, established in 1735 to provide food for ships using the port, but later trialling and distributing many plants of economic importance. This {{was followed by the}} West Indies (Botanic Gardens St. Vincent, 1764) and in 1786 by the Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Botanical Garden in Calcutta, India founded during a period of prosperity when the city was a trading centre for the Dutch East India Company. Other gardens were constructed in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden, 1808), Sri Lanka (Botanical Garden of Peradeniya, 1821 and on a site dating back to 1371), Indonesia (Bogor Botanical Gardens, 1817 and Kebun Raya Cibodas, 1852), and Singapore (Singapore Botanical Gardens, 1822). These {{had a profound effect on}} the economy of the countries, especially in relation to the foods and medicines introduced. The importation of rubber trees to the Singapore Botanic Garden initiated the important <b>rubber</b> <b>industry</b> of the Malay Peninsula.

25|$|At {{the time}} of {{independence}} Malaya had great economic advantages. It was among the world’s leading producers of three valuable commodities, rubber, tin, and palm oil, and also a significant iron ore producer. These export industries gave the Malayan government a healthy surplus to invest in industrial development and infrastructure projects. Like other developing nations in the 1950s and 1960s, Malaya (and later Malaysia) placed great stress on state planning, although UMNO was never a socialist party. The First and Second Malayan Plans (1956–60 and 1961–65 respectively) stimulated economic growth through state investment in industry and repairing infrastructure such as roads and ports, which had been damaged and neglected {{during the war and}} the Emergency. The government was keen to reduce Malaya’s dependence on commodity exports, which put the country at the mercy of fluctuating prices. The government was also aware that demand for natural rubber was bound to fall as the production and use of synthetic rubber expanded. Since a third of the Malay workforce worked in the <b>rubber</b> <b>industry</b> it was important to develop alternative sources of employment. Competition for Malaya’s rubber markets meant that the profitability of the <b>rubber</b> <b>industry</b> increasingly depended on keeping wages low, which perpetuated rural Malay poverty.|$|E
25|$|Chlorinated Polyethylene (PE-C) is an {{inexpensive}} material having a chlorine content from 34 to 44%. It {{is used in}} blends with PVC because the soft, rubbery chloropolyethylene {{is embedded in the}} PVC matrix, thereby increasing the impact resistance. In addition, it also increases the weather resistance. Furthermore, it is used for softening PVC foils, without risking the migrate of plasticizers. Chlorinated polyethylene can be crosslinked peroxidically to form an elastomer which is used in cable and <b>rubber</b> <b>industry.</b> When chlorinated polyethylene is added to other polyolefins, it reduces the flammability.|$|E

25|$|The AFL leadership, however, {{treated the}} CIO {{as an enemy}} from the outset by refusing {{to deal with it}} and {{demanding}} that it dissolve. The AFL's opposition to the CIO, however, only increased the stature of the CIO and Lewis {{in the eyes of the}} industrial workers who were keen on organizing and were disillusioned with the AFL's ineffective performance. Lewis continued to denounce the AFL's policies, and the CIO offered organizing support to workers in the <b>rubber</b> <b>industry</b> who went on strike and formed the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) in defiance of all of the craft divisions that the AFL had required in past organizing efforts.

25|$|Becker {{also had}} to work to resolve an ongoing and lengthy strike in the <b>rubber</b> <b>industry.</b> The United Rubber Workers had struck the Japanese-owned Bridgestone/Firestone tire {{manufacturer}} in July 1994. The company subsequently hired more than 6,000 workers to permanently replace the strikers. The 74,000-member Rubber Workers Union voted {{to return to work}} without a contract. Although the Rubber Workers had rejected merger with the Steelworkers and other unions in the past, now the union's leadership sought merger. The merger was agreed to just as the workers returned to work, and approved by Rubber Workers' members in July 1995. The rubber workers won immediate access to the Steelworkers' $166 million strike fund, research staff, and highly influential pension fund. Becker pushed for a comprehensive campaign strategy to be used against Bridgestone/Firestone. The Steelworkers worked with Japanese labor unions to press the company to negotiate. An innovative public campaign was used to embarrass the company at major events (including the use of a blimp at the Indianapolis 500). These tactics convinced Bridgestone/Firestone management to return to the bargaining table, and the union eventually signed contract that weakened or eliminated a number of management's demands.|$|E
