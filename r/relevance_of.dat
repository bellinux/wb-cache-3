40|$|We {{consider}} two {{settings of}} online learning to rank where feedback {{is restricted to}} top ranked items. The problem is cast as an online game between a learner and sequence of users, over T rounds. In both settings, the learners objective is to present ranked list of items to the users. The learner's performance is judged on the entire ranked list and true <b>relevances</b> <b>of</b> the items. However, the learner receives highly restricted feedback at end of each round, in form <b>of</b> <b>relevances</b> <b>of</b> only the top k ranked items, where k ≪ m. The first setting is non-contextual, where the list of items to be ranked is fixed. The second setting is contextual, where lists of items vary, in form of traditional query-document lists. No stochastic assumption is made on the generation process <b>of</b> <b>relevances</b> <b>of</b> items and contexts. We provide efficient ranking strategies for both the settings. The strategies achieve O(T^ 2 / 3) regret, where regret is based on popular ranking measures in first setting and ranking surrogates in second setting. We also provide impossibility results for certain ranking measures and a certain class of surrogates, when feedback is restricted to the top ranked item, i. e. k= 1. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on simulated and real world datasets. Comment: Under review in JML...|$|R

5|$|Considerable debate exists {{about the}} size of the rebound in energy {{efficiency}} and the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> the Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the {{emerging}} geographic features of current concepts <b>of</b> <b>relevance,</b> and to improve, modify, and extend the framework proposed by Mizzaro (1998). The objective is to define a new framework able to account, more completely and precisely, for the notions <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> involved in mobile information seeking scenarios. Design/methodology/approach – The authors formalise two new dimensions <b>of</b> <b>relevance.</b> The first dimension emphasises the spatio-temporal nature of the information seeking process. The second dimension allows us to describe how different concepts <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> rely on different abstractions of reality. Findings – The new framework allows: to conceptualise the point in space and time at which a given notion <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> refers to; to conceptualise the level of abstraction taken into account by a given notion of relevance; and to include widely adopted facets (e. g. users mobility, preferences, and social context) in the classification <b>of</b> notions <b>of</b> <b>relevance.</b> Originality/value – The conceptual discussion presented in this paper contributes to the future development <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> in the scope of mobile information seeking scenarios. The authors provide a more comprehensive framework for conceptualization, development, and classification <b>of</b> notions <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> in the field of information retrieval and location-based services.

Secondary stability {{is different from the}} initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.|$|E

Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E
