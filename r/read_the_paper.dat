5|$|In 1925, Born and Heisenberg {{formulated}} {{the matrix}} mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born a paper entitled Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen ("Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations") to review, and submit for publication. In the paper, Heisenberg formulated quantum theory, avoiding the concrete, but unobservable, representations of electron orbits by using parameters such as transition probabilities for quantum jumps, which necessitated using two indexes {{corresponding to the}} initial and final states. When Born <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper,</b> he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes at Breslau University.|$|E
25|$|As soon as Joule <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> {{he wrote}} to Thomson with his {{comments}} and questions. Thus began a fruitful, though largely epistolary, collaboration between the two men, Joule conducting experiments, Thomson analysing the results and suggesting further experiments. The collaboration lasted from 1852 to 1856, its discoveries including the Joule–Thomson effect, and the published results did much to bring about general acceptance of Joule's work and the kinetic theory.|$|E

25|$|Several anecdotes {{are known}} about Ansuini. He liked to mock the gendarmes, leaving signed fliers {{in the same}} {{restaurants}} {{where he used to}} eat. Once he went elegantly dressed to Bassano in Teverina and entered the barracks of carabinieri {{in the name of a}} trade man on travel from Milan. On his request, he had an escort of two gendarmes, for personal protection during his journey. At the end he asked the two men to deliver a flyer to their commander. It came about that the commander expressed all his anger when he <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> with the signature of Ansuini. The phenomenon of brigandage was close to being extinguished. Ansuini disappeared after a fight with carabinieri. Menichetti was captured after killing the brigadier Sebastiano Preta, and died in prison.|$|E

25|$|When {{a friend}} (Bernard F. Burke, Prof. of Physics at MIT) told Penzias about a {{preprint}} paper {{he had seen}} by Jim Peebles {{on the possibility of}} finding radiation left over from an explosion that filled the universe at the beginning of its existence, Penzias and Wilson began to realize the significance of their discovery. The characteristics of the radiation detected by Penzias and Wilson fit exactly the radiation predicted by Robert H. Dicke and his colleagues at Princeton University. Penzias called Dicke at Princeton, who immediately sent him a copy of the still-unpublished Peebles paper. Penzias <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> and called Dicke again and invited him to Bell Labs to look at the horn antenna and listen to the background noise. Dicke, Peebles, Wilkinson and P. G. Roll interpreted this radiation as a signature of the Big Bang.|$|E

500|$|A few microbiologists and geneticists {{had taken}} an {{interest}} in the physical and chemical nature of genes before 1944, but the Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment brought renewed and wider interest in the subject. [...] While the original publication did not mention genetics specifically, Avery as well as many of the geneticists who <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> were aware of the genetic implicationsthat Avery may have isolated the gene itself as pure DNA. [...] Biochemist Erwin Chargaff, geneticist H. J. Muller and others praised the result as establishing the biological specificity of DNA and as having important implications for genetics if DNA played a similar role in higher organisms. [...] In 1945, the Royal Society awarded Avery the Copley Medal, in part for his work on bacterial transformation.|$|E
