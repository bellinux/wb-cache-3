5000|$|The {{group may}} also create an [...] "idea book" [...] and post a {{distribution}} list or <b>routing</b> <b>slip</b> {{to the front}} of the book. On the first page is a description of the problem. The first person to receive the book lists his or her ideas and then routes the book to the next person on the distribution list. The second person can log new ideas or add to the ideas of the previous person. This continues until the distribution list is exhausted. A follow-up [...] "read out" [...] meeting is then held to discuss the ideas logged in the book. This technique takes longer, but it allows individuals time to think deeply about the problem.|$|E

5000|$|Each order, {{after it}} was {{accepted}} by the factory, received a number. That number was then put on what were essentially <b>routing</b> <b>slips</b> prepared at the plant's office. These indicated which departments the order would pass through and what parts were to be fabricated and assembled. These slips accompanied materials. On them, each department foreman placed the time and wages expanded, {{as well as the}} machines and materials used on that order while it was in his department. The completed set of slips thus provided a record of the costs of labor and materials used to complete each order. They also gave an accurate account of the cost of operating each department. In addition, the ticket acted as an authority to do work and to requisition materials. It also became a [...] "roll call or time check" [...] on the working force.|$|R
40|$|Most {{undergraduate}} students {{have never seen}} a production process, thus have no visualization of lecture material presented. We provide an exercise that: • gives intense, interactive exposure to challenges in a production environment • gives appreciation of the importance of training, layout, line balancing and cellularization • provides experience of the potential havoc Activity simulates multi-workstation manufacturing. Each station has a number of component parts that assemble into the product. The goal is to complete as many jobs as possible during the allotted time. Students are assigned positions (operator, scheduler, material-handler, production control, inspector, or accountant) and perform tasks per work orders and <b>routing</b> <b>slips</b> associated with each job according to the parts list and prototypes provided. Operational problems are expected, and students must face them as they arise. Afterward, students answer questions about their experience and observations. Instructor conducts a discussion that solidifies the clarity of teaching points...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed {{the state line}} and reached Wheatland, Pennsylvania, it was a half-mile (0.8 km) wide and had regained F5 strength. A steel-frame {{trucking}} plant in Wheatland was completely obliterated and partially swept away at F5 intensity, as the building's steel girder frame was mangled into a pile and pushed off of the foundation. At nearby Wheatland Sheet and Tube, sections of pavement were scoured from the parking lot, and shards of sheet metal and <b>routing</b> <b>slips</b> were left wedged beneath the remaining asphalt. Ninety-five percent of Wheatland's business and residential area were destroyed. According to Storm Data from the National Weather Service, {{the destruction of the}} town [...] "resembled that of a bombed-out battle field." [...] Continuing east, the tornado weakened slightly but remained violent as it struck Hermitage, damaging or destroying 71 homes along with the town's airport, destroying several hangars and planes. A wing from one of the planes was found 10 miles away in Mercer. Another trucking steel processing plant were heavily damaged in Hermitage as well. The tornado then destroyed 15 homes and damaged 30 others in the Greenfield area before finally dissipating.|$|R
2500|$|Godinot {{was only}} [...] from Baza. Possession {{of that city}} would cut off Freire's retreat route, but the French general hesitated. La Cuadra was {{reported}} approaching from the east and his men were worn out from marching and fighting. So Godinot halted his troops and threw out scouts. Meanwhile, Freire heard of O'Donnell's <b>rout</b> and <b>slipped</b> away from the Gor ravine {{in the evening and}} marched his entire army through Baza at night. At daylight on 10 August, Soult found the Gor lines empty and ordered Latour-Maubourg to conduct an immediate pursuit.|$|R
40|$|In a {{rotating}} frame, making measurements and transferring data are highly complicated. Generally, {{signals from the}} rotating system to the stationary frame are <b>routed</b> through <b>slip</b> rings. While doing so, the signals are hampered by noise and drift arising from rotation and its allied effects. The Large Scale Rotating Rig (LSRR) at NAL is a turbo machinery research facility demanding multiple pressure measurements across a rotor in its wake flows and over its surface. A wireless system has been developed to cater this type of measurement in LSRR avoiding signal transfer through slip rings. The system also offers relief from complicated wiring and tubing across the rotating transducers in LSRR. The wireless system consists of a PIC microcontroller for acquisition and processing of data and a zigbee controller for transmitting the data in wireless mode. The system interacts with a 32 port electronic pressure scanner that senses the pressure data in the rotating frame. A Graphical User Interface software program was developed using LabVIEW to control the rig and receive {{the data from the}} scanner...|$|R
50|$|SR 13 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with US 19/SR 9, which are aligned onto two one-way streets: Spring Street NW southbound and Peachtree Street NE northbound. The highway starts heading west but curves {{around to the}} northeast along a section of freeway adjacent to I-85. A half-interchange provides a shortcut for southbound traffic to Peachtree Street and from Peachtree Street to SR 13 north. The ramps provide a savings of 3/4 mi by allowing vehicles to avoid the southernmost section of the connector. The connector itself avoids having exits with surface roads (Monroe Drive, Piedmont Road, and Sidney Marcus Boulevard) on the newer I-85 <b>routing,</b> aside from <b>slip</b> ramps between {{the old and new}} freeways.|$|R
