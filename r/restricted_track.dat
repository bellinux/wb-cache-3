We study a <b>restricted</b> <b>track</b> assignment problem (RTAP) : if an interval Ia contains another interval I b then Ia must be assigned to a higher track than I b, and {{the goal is to}} minimize the number of tracks used. The problem RTAP is shown to be NP-hard. An approximation algorithm that produces a solution within twice of the optimal is also presented and the bound is shown to be tight.

40|$|When rodents {{engage in}} {{irregular}} foraging {{in an open}} field environment, hippocampal principal cells exhibit place-specific firing that is statistically independent of the direction of traverse through the place field. When the path is restricted to a track, however, in-field rates differ substantially in opposite directions. Frequently, the representations of the track in the two directions are essentially orthogonal. We show that this directionally selective firing is not hard-wired, but develops through experience-dependent plasticity. During the rats’ first pass in each direction, place fields were highly directionally symmetric, whereas over subsequent laps, the firing rates in the two directions gradually but substantially diverged. We conclude that, even on a <b>restricted</b> <b>track,</b> place cell firing is initially determined by allocentric position, and only later, the within-field firing rates change in response to differential sensory information or behavioral cues in the two directions. In agreement with previous data, place fields near local cues, such as textures on the track, developed less directionality than place fields on a uniform part of the track, possibly because the local cues reduced the net difference in sensory input at a given point. Directionality also developed in an open environment without physical restriction of the animal’s path, when rats learned to run along a specified path. In this case, directionality developed later than on the running track, only after the rats began to run in a stereotyped manner. Although the average population firing rates exhibited little if any change over laps in either direction, the direction-specific firing rates in a given place field were up- or down-regulated with about equal probability and magnitude, which was independent in the two directions, suggesting some form of competitive mechanism (e. g., LTP/LTD) acting coherently {{on the set of}} synapses conveying external information to each cell...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel framework for track fitting which is usable {{in a wide}} range of experiments, independent of the specific event topology, detector setup, or magnetic field arrangement. This goal is achieved through a completely modular design. Fitting algorithms are implemented as interchangeable modules. At present, the framework contains a validated Kalman filter. Track parameterizations and the routines required to extrapolate the track parameters and their covariance matrices through the experiment are also implemented as interchangeable modules. Different track parameterizations and extrapolation routines can be used simultaneously for fitting of the same physical track. Representations of detector hits are the third modular ingredient to the framework. The hit dimensionality and orientation of planar tracking detectors are not <b>restricted.</b> <b>Tracking</b> information from detectors which do not measure the passage of particles in a fixed physical detector plane, e. g. drift chambers or TPCs, is used without any simplifications.

40|$|Abstract. Many {{difficult}} visual {{problems like}} monocular human tracking require complex heuristic generative models defined over high-dimensional parameter spaces. Despite their successes, optimization with such models remains notoriously complex {{due to the}} difficulty of flexibly using prior knowledge in order to reshape an initially designed representation space. Non-linearities, inherent sparsity of high-dimensional training sets and lack of global continuity makes dimensionality reduction challenging and low-dimensional search inefficient. To address these problems, we present a sampling-based optimization framework that <b>restricts</b> <b>tracking</b> to low-dimensional spaces via non-linear embedding. The formulation leads to a layered generative model where global continuous optimization over the embedded manifold is made possible. Our prior flattening method allows a simple analytic treatment of boundary and manifold intrinsic curvature constraints and allows consistent iterative and closed-form solutions for embedded geodesic and sequence smoothing calculations. We analyze the structure of reduced manifold representations for a variety of human interaction activities and demonstrate that the approach gives accurate tracking and reconstruction of fast self-occluded motion in cluttered monocular video. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to the field of}} short-range ultra-wideband (UWB) Radar. In particular, an object recognition approach performed by a bi-static UWB Radar has been investigated in this thesis. The investigated objects consist of simple canonical and some polygonal complex objects which are scanned on a circular track at about 1 m distance. Geometrical features, texture features and moment based features are extracted from the Radar data to carry out the recognition. Yet, the precise temporal evolution is subject to massive distortions, mainly caused by severe interference conditions and transient effects of the hardware. Thus, super-resolution algorithms have been developed which go far beyond the classical bandwidth given resolution and asked for research on various fields: (i) An innovative wavefront extraction algorithm with polarimetric diversity exploitation has been developed to separate pulses which overlap almost the whole pulse duration; (ii) a highly precise feature extraction algorithm has been developed which localises significant scattering centres by processing the previously extracted wavefronts; (iii) a novel UWB object recognition algorithm has been developed to classify and discriminate the resulting microwave images. When scanning objects from all sides, exceptional recognition of objects was achieved by a minimum mean squared error classifier. Further improvement in recognition was obtained, especially at severly <b>restricted</b> <b>tracks,</b> by the application of Bayes theory which constitutes a superior classifier to the above. In addition to the main field of research, a novel stereoscopic 3 D UWB imaging algorithm, based on a spatially spanned synthetic aperture in conjunction with ellipsoidal shaped wavefronts, has been developed. The ultimate test of any model and system is an experimental validation. Consequently in this thesis, all developed algorithms and the object recognition as a whole system are experimentally validated within an elaborate measurement campaign...|$|R
