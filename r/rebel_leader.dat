5|$|In mid-September 632 AD, Khalid {{defeated}} Tulaiha, a main <b>rebel</b> <b>leader</b> {{who claimed}} prophethood {{as a means}} to draw support for himself. Tulaiha's power was crushed after his remaining followers were defeated at the Battle of Ghamra. Khalid next marched to Naqra and defeated the rebel tribe of Banu Saleem at the Battle of Naqra. The region was secured after the Battle of Zafar in October 632 with the defeat of a tribal mistress, Salma.|$|E
40|$|I {{present a}} model of {{mobilization}} and tactical choice by <b>rebels.</b> The <b>rebel</b> <b>leaders</b> have two tactics available to them, which I call terrorism and insurgency. Insurgency is most effective when public mobilization is high, whereas terrorism can be effective with more limited mobilization. The model yields five key results. First, successful terrorist campaigns demonstrate rebel capacity and increase mobilization, allowing <b>rebel</b> <b>leaders</b> to shift tactics to insurgency. Second, successful counterinsurgencies demonstrate lack of rebel capacity and diminish mobilization, leading <b>rebel</b> <b>leaders</b> to shift from insurgency to terrorism or withdraw from conflict altogether. As such, successful counterinsurgencies may actually {{lead to an increase}} in terrorism. Third, increased non-violent opportunity decreases insurgency but has a non-monotone effect on terrorism, since when opportunity is very bad <b>rebel</b> <b>leaders</b> substitute from terrorism to insurgency and when opportunity is very good <b>rebel</b> <b>leaders</b> withdraw from conflict. This non-monotonicity suggests the importance of considering the endogenous choice among tactics in empirical research on the causes of terrorism, insurgency, and civil war. Fourth, the ideological extremism or social isolation of <b>rebel</b> <b>leaders</b> is positively correlated with terrorism, but not with insurgency. Finally, engaging in conflict has option value in terms of the organization surviving to fight another day when circumstances are more favorable. Hence, during the last gasps of conflict, <b>rebel</b> <b>leaders</b> continue to engage in terrorism longer than is in their short-term interests. I have benefited from the comments of Scott Ashworth, Ron Francisco, Michael Horowitz, Andy Kydd...|$|R

5|$|Between 1594 and 1603, Elizabeth {{faced her}} most severe test in Ireland during the Nine Years' War, a revolt {{that took place}} at the height of {{hostilities}} with Spain, who backed the <b>rebel</b> <b>leader,</b> Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. In spring 1599, Elizabeth sent Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, to put the revolt down. To her frustration, he made little progress and returned to England in defiance of her orders. He was replaced by Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, who took three years to defeat the rebels. O'Neill finally surrendered in 1603, a few days after Elizabeth's death. Soon afterwards, a peace treaty was signed between England and Spain.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, the UN {{deployed}} United Nations Operation in the Congo (UNOC), {{the largest}} military force of its early decades, to bring {{order to the}} breakaway State of Katanga, restoring it to {{the control of the}} Democratic Republic of the Congo by 1964. While travelling to meet with <b>rebel</b> <b>leader</b> Moise Tshombe during the conflict, Dag Hammarskjöld, often named as one of the UN's most effective Secretaries-General, died in a plane crash; months later he was posthumously awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1964, Hammarskjöld's successor, U Thant, deployed the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, which would become one of the UN's longest-running peacekeeping missions.|$|E

5|$|In Washington, Savimbi forged close {{relationships}} with influential conservatives, including Michael Johns (The Heritage Foundation's foreign policy analyst {{and a key}} Savimbi advocate), Grover Norquist (President of Americans for Tax Reform and a Savimbi economic advisor), and others, who played critical roles in elevating escalated U.S. covert aid to Savimbi's UNITA and visited with Savimbi in his Jamba, Angola headquarters to provide the Angolan <b>rebel</b> <b>leader</b> with military, political and other guidance in his war against the MPLA government. With enhanced U.S. support, the war quickly escalated, {{both in terms of}} the intensity of the conflict and also in its perception as a key conflict in the overall Cold War.|$|E

5|$|The {{meetings}} of the Puerto Rican Independence movement which met in St. Thomas were discovered by the Spanish authorities {{and the members of}} the movement were either imprisoned or exiled. In a letter dated October 1, 1824, which Venezuelan <b>rebel</b> <b>leader</b> José María Rojas sent to María de las Mercedes Barbudo, Rojas stated that the Venezuelan rebels had lost their principal contact with the Puerto Rican Independence movement in the Danish island of Saint Thomas and therefore the secret communication which existed between the Venezuelan rebels and the leaders of the Puerto Rican independence movements was in danger of being discovered.|$|E

5|$|In 1815, Emperor Gia Long summoned {{him back}} in order to {{suppress}} widespread rebellions in central Vietnam. In 1819, Duyệt was in Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa in northern Vietnam putting down revolts for Gia Long. During this time, he joined forces with a former <b>rebel</b> <b>leader</b> from a highlands minority group in Cao Bằng. This man became Duyệt's adopted son under the name Lê Văn Khôi and his men also rallied to the court. Khoi was then propelled directly into a high-ranking post in Gia Định. During the final four years of Gia Long's reign, Duyệt ascended to the highest rank in the court, and he and Pham Dang Hung, another southerner, {{were the only people}} present as the emperor died. Gia Long decreed that Duyệt take command of five royal regiments.|$|E
5|$|Later, in May 2006 a {{commando}} {{company group}} was deployed to Timor Leste {{as part of}} Operation Astute, after relations between the East Timorese government and military forces broke down. The commandos operated alongside the SASR {{as part of the}} Special Forces Component and were tasked with advanced force operations in preparation for the arrival of follow-on forces, focusing on Dili Airport. In March 2007, the commandos, along with elements of the SASR, took part in the Battle of Same during which five rebels were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend the <b>rebel</b> <b>leader,</b> Alfredo Reinado. After the battle, the commandos and SASR elements were withdrawn {{at the request of the}} East Timorese government in order to start negotiations with the rebels.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 1985, American {{conservative}} activists {{held the}} Democratic International, a symbolic meeting of anti-Communist militants, at UNITA's headquarters in Jamba.

The Reagan administration, although unwilling to publicly support the meeting, privately expressed approval. The governments of Israel and South Africa supported the idea, but both respective countries were deemed inadvisable for hosting the conference.|$|E

5|$|Suffolk was the {{dominant}} magnate in the East Anglia region. When the region's peasants revolted in 1381, {{he became a}} central figure in their repression. While in Bury St Edmunds, he was taken by surprise by the rebels while eating dinner. The <b>rebel</b> <b>leader,</b> Geoffrey Litster, attempted to force Suffolk to join the rebellion, hoping to lend legitimacy to the cause. When this failed, Litster turned to other prominent men. Suffolk then fled disguised as a groom, reaching London by way of St Albans. He soon returned to Bury with a force of 500 lances, and met little resistance. Much of the work suppressing the rebellion had been undertaken by Henry Despenser, Bishop of Norwich, leaving Suffolk to apprehend the remaining rebels for trial. In the rebellion Suffolk suffered financially: the peasants plundered property worth £1,000 from his castle at Mettingham.|$|E
5|$|The Han dynasty {{was founded}} by the peasant <b>rebel</b> <b>leader</b> (Liu Bang), known posthumously as Emperor Gao (r. 202 –195 BC) or Gaodi. The longest reigning emperor of the dynasty was Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BC), or Wudi, who reigned for 54 years. The dynasty was briefly {{interrupted}} by the Xin dynasty of the former regent Wang Mang, but he was overthrown in 23 AD and the Han dynasty was reestablished by Liu Xiu, known posthumously as Emperor Guangwu (r. 25–57 AD), or Guangwu Di. The last Han emperor, Emperor Xian (r. 189–220 AD), was a puppet monarch of Chancellor Cao Cao (155–220 AD), who dominated the court and was made King of Wei. In 220 AD, Cao's son Pi usurped the throne as Emperor Wen of Wei (r. 220–226 AD) and ended the Han dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The rebel {{leaders were}} quickly rounded up. A <b>rebel</b> <b>leader</b> {{by the name}} of Jack Straw was {{captured}} in London and executed. John Ball was caught in Coventry, tried in St Albans, and executed on 15 July. Grindecobbe was also tried and executed in St Albans. John Wrawe was tried in London; he probably gave evidence against 24 of his colleagues in the hope of a pardon, but was sentenced to be executed by being hanged, drawn and quartered on 6 May 1382. Sir Roger Bacon was probably arrested before the final battle in Norfolk, and was tried and imprisoned in the Tower of London before finally being pardoned by the Crown. As of September 1381, Thomas Ingleby of Bridgwater had successfully evaded the authorities.|$|E

25|$|The {{participants}} were Gamali Galaleiddine, Khalil Abdalla Adam, Salah Abu Surra, Khamis Abdallah Abakar, Ahmed Abdelshafi, Abdalla Yahya, Khalil Ibrahim (of the Justice and Equality Movement) and Ahmed Ibrahim Ali Diraige. Closed-door meetings between the AU-UN and <b>rebel</b> <b>leaders,</b> {{as well as}} among <b>rebel</b> <b>leaders</b> took place. Eight more participants arrived on 4 August (including Jar el-Neby, Salah Adam Isaac and Suleiman Marajan), while the SLM Unity faction boycotted the talks because the Sudanese government had threatened to arrest Suleiman Jamous if he left the hospital. The <b>rebel</b> <b>leaders</b> aimed to unify their positions and demands, which included compensation for the victims and autonomy for Darfur. They eventually reached agreement on joint demands, including power and wealth sharing, security, land and humanitarian issues.|$|R
5|$|When the Mongol envoys led by Qidai Tuoyin showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister Ananda Pyissi {{was well}} aware of the {{military}} power of the Mongols and advised King Narathihapate to use diplomacy. The king was furious at the demand and kept the Mongol envoys waiting for weeks. The court finally devised a compromise: the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king. Accompanying them was a Burmese envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the Burmese king's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing. The king then promptly ordered an expedition, which retook the rebellious borderland regions in April 1272. The <b>rebel</b> <b>leader</b> A-Pi (အပိ) was brought back to Pagan. Dali relayed the news to Beijing but did not carry out any military action.|$|E
5|$|As it {{is clear}} that the demands of his job are taking a toll on Chris, Carla becomes {{increasingly}} uncomfortable with the brutal competition among firms and the violence they incite in other countries. Seeking an escape from Shorn and to save their marriage, Carla, with the help of her father, who lives in the London Zones, and her mother in Sweden, secures a position at the United Nations as an Ombudsman, a sort of outside auditor/investigator who attempts to enforce the UN's mandate across the world. This position is viewed as honourable but ultimately ineffective as neither the US nor UK recognise the UN's authority and run roughshod over them in their pursuit of profits. After an initially frosty meeting, Chris' conditions are agreed on, but with the requirement that he stay in place at Shorn through the end of the current conflict in Cambodia, in which Shorn is backing a <b>rebel</b> <b>leader.</b>|$|E
5|$|De Montfort {{was unable}} to {{consolidate}} his victory and widespread disorder persisted across the country. In France, Eleanor made plans for an invasion of England {{with the support of}} Louis, while Edward escaped his captors in May and formed a new army. Edward pursued de Montfort's forces through the Marches, before striking east to attack his fortress at Kenilworth and then turning once more on the <b>rebel</b> <b>leader</b> himself. De Montfort, accompanied by the captive Henry, {{was unable to}} retreat and the Battle of Evesham ensued. Edward was triumphant and de Montfort's corpse was mutilated by the victors; Henry, who was wearing borrowed armour, was almost killed by Edward's forces during the fighting before they recognised the King and escorted him to safety. In places the now leaderless rebellion dragged on, with some rebels gathering at Kenilworth, which Henry and Edward took after a long siege in 1266. The remaining pockets of resistance were mopped up, and the final rebels, holed up in the Isle of Ely, surrendered in July 1267, marking the end of the war.|$|E
