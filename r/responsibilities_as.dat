5|$|As a consequence, Lord Russell {{inspected}} the coast along an anchorage known as Portland Roads, {{and concluded that}} two castles, Portland and Sandsfoot, should be constructed {{to protect it from}} naval attack. Work began that summer, with Oliver Lawrence acting as the royal paymaster for the project, and was completed by 1541, at a cost of £4,964. Thomas Mervin was appointed as captain, with a garrison of four gunners and two other men. In 1545, Mervin was replaced by John Leweston, who also took on <b>responsibilities</b> <b>as</b> the Lieutenant of Portland, along with a larger garrison of 13 men, paid for out of the proceeds of the recent Dissolution of the Monasteries. A survey between 1547 and 1548 reported that the castle was equipped with one brass demi-cannon, two brass demi-culverins, four breech-loading portpieces and four slings; it also held eight hagbushes–a type of early arquebus–along with twenty-three bows, twenty-nine bills and twelve pikes.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of how conceptions of responsibility have affected social responses to HIV/AIDS. The central premise of this work is that how responsibility for the disease is presumed has a determining impact upon policy and individual reactions to the epidemic. This in turn influence {{the spread of the}} disease. This thesis also addresses how AIDS and its associated meanings provides and necessitates new ways of understanding social relations of responsibility. I begin with a theoretical exploration of dominant perspectives on responsibility through the development of two analytical categories: <b>responsibility</b> <b>as</b> freedom and <b>responsibility</b> <b>as</b> control. The first of these represents those approaches to responsibility that regard it as the condition that makes individual freedom possible. The second views all notions of <b>responsibility</b> <b>as</b> an inherently restrictive means of individual self-disciplining which only serves to protect the status-quo. In the successive case studies on health promotion materials, I-IIV testing policy and the criminalisation of HIV transmission, I develop a detailed analysis of the embeddedness of individual <b>responsibility</b> <b>as</b> promoted by the <b>responsibility</b> <b>as</b> freedom model, and of the accompanying critiques of those individualised approaches that some from the <b>responsibility</b> <b>as</b> control model. I then explore and alternative form of apprehending responsibility that transcends this abrupt dichotomy between freedom and control. Using the example of the 1 3 th International AIDS Conference at Durban, I elaborate an intersubjective model of responsibility. In this framework, I propose an understanding of responsibility founded on social relations and the interconnectedness of social actors. This position also acknowledges the political struggles inevitably involved in attempts to bring about change, struggles which involve individuals, civil society, organisations and states.
