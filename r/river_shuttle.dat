Nantes built its first compressed-air tram network in 1879, which was electrified in 1911. Like most European tram networks, Nantes' disappeared during the 1950s in the wake of automobiles and buses. However, in 1985 Nantes was the first city in France to reintroduce trams. The city has an extensive public-transport network consisting of trams, buses and river shuttles. The Nantes tramway has three lines and a total of [...] of track. Semitan counted 132.6 million trips in 2015, of which 72.3 million were by tram. Navibus, the <b>river</b> <b>shuttle,</b> has two lines: one on the Erdre and the other on the Loire. The latter has 520,000 passengers annually and succeeds the Roquio service, which operated on the Loire from 1887 to the 1970s.|$|E

30|$|Drainage morphometry {{provides}} quantitative {{description of}} the drainage system which is {{an important aspect of}} the characterisation of watersheds. Chalakudi River is one of the important rivers of the South India which has attracted attention of many environmental scientists recently because of the proposed Athirapally Hydel Project across the <b>river.</b> SRTM (<b>Shuttle</b> Radar Topographic Mission) data were used for preparing DEM (Digital Elevation Model), Aspect Map and Slope Map. Geographical Information System (GIS) was used for the evaluation of linear, areal and relief aspects of morphometric parameters. The study reveals that the terrain exhibits dentritic and trellis pattern of drainage. The Chalakudi River Basin has a total area of 1, 448.73  km 2 and is designated as seventh-order basin. The drainage density of the basin is estimated as 2.54 and the lower-order streams mostly dominate the basin. The high basin relief indicates high runoff and sediment transport. The elongation ratio of the Chalakudi Basin is estimated as 0.48 and indicates that the shape of the basin is elongated. The development of stream segments in the basin area is more or less effected by rainfall. Relief ratio indicates that the discharge capability of watershed is very high and the groundwater potential is meagre. The low value of drainage density in spite of mountainous relief indicates that the area is covered by dense vegetation and resistant rocks permeated by fractures and joints. These studies are helpful in watershed development planning and wise utilization of natural resources.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 River {{modeling}} is {{an important}} component of flood forecasting system that can simulate the water flow dynamics of a stream network and forecast river levels in flood prone regions. Around the world, especially in the developing regions, many large river basins are mostly ungauged. For these basins river model setup is very challenging due to lack of necessary in-situ and routine measurement of river bathymetry, flood plain and river boundary data. Moreover, lack of data sharing among the countries occupying the trans-boundary rivers, also a hurdle to river model development. For such basins, proxy approaches depending on the satellite based remotely sensed data could be an alternative solution. In this study, one dimensional hydrodynamic model has been developed for the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna basin region using the Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS). Only 7 % of the total basin area has good quality in-situ measurement of river hydraulics. For the remaining part, remotely sensed data have been utilized for river model development. This study utilized: a) LANDSAT/MODIS for identifying flow path of <b>river</b> network, b) <b>Shuttle</b> Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) for extracting river profile c) Radar altimeter for establishing depth-width relationship and d) Precipitation data to generate sub basin wise flow data. Simulated model results have been tested at two downstream low lying locations. The outcome of the study showed significant improvement of root mean square error (RMSE) for river level simulation from 3. 0 m to 1. 0 m. A step by step `rule book' has been documented to facilitate the setting up river models for similar type basins around the world for operational water agencies...|$|R

5000|$|The River Cray is a {{tributary}} of the River Darent in southern England, rising in Priory Gardens Orpington (London Borough of Bromley), where rainwater permeates the chalk bedrock and forms a pond at the boundary between the chalk and impermeable clay. Initially it flows northwards, past the industrial and residential area of St Mary Cray, through St Paul's Cray (where it once powered a paper mill) and through Foots Cray, where it enters the parkland of Foots Cray Meadows, flowing under Five Arches bridge (built in 1781 as part of the designs for Foots Cray Meadows drawn up by Capability Brown) and past Loring Hall (c.1760), once the home of Lord Castlereagh, who committed suicide there in 1822. It continues northwards through North Cray and Bexley, where there is a restored Gothic cold plunge bath house, built around 1766 as part of Vale Mascal Estate. It is then joined by the <b>River</b> <b>Shuttle</b> and then continues through the parkland of Hall Place, which was built for John Champneys in 1540. The Cray now turns eastward through Crayford and Barnes Cray to join the River Darent in Dartford Creek. The Creek flows northward to enter the River Thames between Crayford Marshes and Dartford Marshes at a point known as Crayford Ness. The villages through which the Cray flows are collectively known as [...] "The Crays".|$|E
