He has a rivalry with Teku member Shirako Takamoto, mainly because he doesn't {{like the music}} Shirako listens to. Porkchop has a strong {{relationship}} with Maniac mechanic Mitchell [...] "Monkey" [...] Mclurg. He initially drives the car [...] "Jack Hammer" [...] and motorcycle [...] "Jaw Jammer", but changes to the car [...] "Piledriver" [...] {{towards the end of}} the series. He usually comes to the rescue of Monkey, such as when the Racers needed to hijack one of the Racing Drones' [...] "Sweepers"(basically a big rig the Drones use to capture racers) that Porkchop and Monkey had to get inside. The Sweeper's driver caught Monkey and Porkchop came through the wall and punched its head off. Porkchop had a childhood fear of water, which caused him big trouble in the Water Realm, then he froze up and didn't hit the EDR(emergency driver <b>return)</b> <b>device</b> until water came in and was about to drown him. He came out of the portal at the same speed he was going, landing on a conviently placed pile of cardboard boxes and supplies, though he was still hurt. Later in the infirmary Monkey talked to him about it. Porkchop then told him about how he saw his father drowned when he was a kid. Monkey comically asked if that was why he's never taken a bath. Angered, Porkchop replied by saying that he took a bath... ONCE. Since then he seemed to get over his fear.|$|E
40|$|A device {{monitors}} a blood {{path from}} a blood vessel access {{of a human}} subject through an extracorporeal blood processing apparatus {{and back to the}} blood vessel access. A pumping device in the blood path is operable to pump blood through the blood path from the blood withdrawal device to the blood <b>return</b> <b>device.</b> The monitoring device obtains pressure data from a pressure sensor arranged upstream of the pumping device in the blood path, and processes the pressure data for detection of a disruption of the blood path downstream of the pumping device, e. g. caused by VND (Venous Needle Dislodgement). The disruption is detected by evaluating presence/absence of cross-talk pulses at the pressure sensor, where the cross-talk pulses originate from one or more pulse generators in the extracorporeal blood processing apparatus and have propagated on a propagation path in a direction downstream of the pumping device through the blood <b>return</b> <b>device,</b> the blood vessel access and the blood withdrawal device to the pressure sensor...|$|E
40|$|The module has a movable {{vibrator}} head (2) with {{at least}} two plates (6, 8). One plate (8) carries a holder (10) for parts or tools. The two plates are parallel to a base of the vibrator head remote from the workpiece and are driven in oscillation along a longitudinal direction so that the tool holder vibrates in a plane. Each plate has a through opening (18, 20) for a rotary drive connection from the holder to a drive unit (24) {{on the other side of}} the plate from the workpiece. The plate on the workpiece side rotatably encloses the holder. The plates can be positioned wrt. each other and the head base for fine positioning. The positioning and oscillating drives for the plates are each provided by lifting magnets (28, 30) interacting with a sprung <b>return</b> <b>device</b> (36, 38).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} performance for a cam transmission of an engine valve train operating with a mechanical spring and with a return spring device that uses a pneumatic spring. Dynamic analysis of the cam mechanism is performed in the frequency and time domains employing a combined lumped-distributed parameter model capable of predicting {{the effects of the}} higher harmonics of the cam lift profile on system performance, in particular of the return spring device. Dynamic stiffness of the transmission in the frequency domain and time history of the contact force between cam and follower are evaluated. The limits of the traditional mechanical spring-closing system at high-speed camshaft operations are investigated, highlighting that they are mainly imposed by the internal resonances of the spring. The pneumatic spring is an improved replacement of the steel spring, because of better dynamic behavior. Furthermore, the pneumatic <b>return</b> <b>device</b> allows preload tuning of the spring, which may increase transmission efficiency through proper control of the fluid pressure. Study of the pressure control circuit is also presente...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background One {{method of}} {{collecting}} mosquitoes {{is to use}} human beings as bait. This is called human landing collection and is a reference method for evaluating mosquito density per person. The Mbita trap, described by Mathenge et al in the literature, consists of an entry-no <b>return</b> <b>device</b> whereby humans are used as bait but cannot be bitten. We compared the Mbita trap and human landing collection in field conditions to estimate mosquito density and malaria transmission. Methods Our study {{was carried out in}} the highlands of Madagascar in three traditional villages, for 28 nights distributed over six months, with a final comparison between 448 men-nights for human landing and 84 men-nights for Mbita trap, resulting in 6, 881 and 85 collected mosquitoes, respectively. Results The number of mosquitoes collected was 15. 4 per human-night and 1. 0 per trap-night, i. e. an efficiency of 0. 066 for Mbita trap vs. human landing. The number of anophelines was 10. 30 per human-night and 0. 55 per trap-night, i. e. an efficiency of 0. 053. This efficiency was 0. 10 for indoor Anopheles funestus, 0. 24 for outdoor An. funestus, and 0. 03 for Anopheles arabiensis. Large and unexplained variations in efficiency were observed between villages and months. Conclusion In the highlands of Madagascar with its unique, highly zoophilic malaria vectors, Mbita trap collection was poor and unreliable compared to human landing collections, which remains the reference method for evaluating mosquito density and malaria transmission. This conclusion, however, should not be extrapolated directly to other areas such as tropical Africa, where malaria vectors are consistently endophilic. </p...|$|E

40|$|Because cometary {{surfaces}} {{are likely to}} be far colder and of a different composition than planetary surfaces, there are some new considerations that must be examined in regards to placing instrumented packages or sample <b>return</b> <b>devices</b> on their surfaces. The qualitative analysis of the problem of attaching hardware to a comet and not being ejected back into space can be divided into two parts. The first problem is to pierce the mantle and obtain access to the icy core. Drilling through the mantle requires that the drilling forces be reacted. Reacting such forces probably requires attachment to the icy core below. Therefore, some kinetic impact piercing device is likely to be required as the first act of attachment. The second problem for a piercing device to overcome is the force produced by the impact kinetic energy that tries to eject the piercing device back into space. The mantle and icy core can absorb some of the impact kinetic energy in the form of fracture formation and friction energy. The energy that is not absorbed in these two ways is stored by the core as elastic deformation of the mantle and icy core. It is concluded that because the cometary materials are almost certainly brittle and the icy core is likely to be self lubricating, the elastic rebound and gas pressure expulsion forces must be counteracted by forces greater than those that may be provided by a piercing device or its capture devices (barbs) ...|$|R
