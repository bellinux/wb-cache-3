40|$|A robust {{method is}} {{proposed}} to generate tool paths for NURBS-based machining of arbitrarily shaped freeform pockets with islands. Although the {{input and output}} are all of higher-degree NURBS curves, only one simple category of geometric entities, i. e., line segments, is required for initial offsetting and for detecting and removing self-intersecting loops. Furthermore, using those linear non-self-intersecting offsets as the legs of NURBS control polygons, NURBS-format tool paths can be smoothly reconstructed with G(1) -continuity, no overcutting, no cusps, and global error control. Since all operations involved in computing tool path curves are linear geometric calculations, the method is robust and simple. Examples with integrated <b>rough</b> and finish <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> paths of pockets demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of this method...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{quality of}} {{abrasive}} grains {{is crucial to}} increase the lifespan of <b>roughing,</b> polishing and <b>cutting</b> <b>tools.</b> The purpose of the work herein was to evaluate the variables of the blue fired aluminum oxide heat treatment process. This heat treatment process improves the physical properties of the brown fused aluminum oxide and results in a blue coloring, which uniquely identifies it within the abrasives industry. The work herein includes information beginning with the electro-fusion process of bauxite (the manufacturing of the brown fused aluminum oxide) to the Blue Fired process. It also compares the fracture resistance index between these materials. This index is the inverse of the friability. Besides the content of titanium and iron oxides, process variables such as time, temperature and atmospheric conditions are important to monitor {{in order to reach}} standard requirements. Experimental evidence measuring these parameters is presented in the article herein. The blue coloring of this aluminum oxide is explained by the optical phenomena of electron transition, and not by the formation of aluminum titanate, as some technical literature has stated. Furthermore, it was proved that the coloring of blue fired material should not be used exclusively as an indicator of the optimal abrasive characteristics of this class of aluminum oxide...|$|R
