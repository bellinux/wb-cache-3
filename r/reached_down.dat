5|$|The Royal Navy {{conducted}} two inquiries {{into the}} reasons for the ship's quick demise. The first, held soon after the ship's loss, concluded that Hoods aft magazine had exploded after one of Bismarcks shells penetrated the ship's armour. A second inquiry was held after complaints that the first board had failed to consider alternative explanations, such as an explosion of the ship's torpedoes. It was more thorough than the first board and concurred with the first board's conclusion. Despite the official explanation, some historians continued to believe that the torpedoes caused the ship's loss, while others proposed an accidental explosion inside one of the ship's gun turrets that <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> into the magazine. Other historians have concentrated on the cause of the magazine explosion. The discovery of the ship's wreck in 2001 confirmed the conclusion of both boards, although the exact reason the magazines detonated is likely to remain unknown since that area of the ship was destroyed in the explosion.|$|E

According to the Pierce County Coroner's report, he suffered a heart attack, although bridgemen believed his death {{was the result of}} electrocution.|$|E
25|$|Firetrucks were {{positioned}} along De Waal Drive and the M3, {{as well as}} near UCT. The fire <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> to the M3's hospital bend, opposite Groote Schuur Hospital, thus causing traffic {{officials to}} close the road and re-route all incoming traffic onto Mowbray Main Road.

25|$|There {{have been}} at least two glacial periods {{in the history of the}} {{mountains}} and they were glaciated as little as 2,000 years ago. During the Last ice age, the Bale Mountains were one of the most extensively glaciated areas in present day Ethiopia, with a total area of ice in Bale of approximately 180km2. There was a 30km2 ice cap around the peak of Tulu Dimtu (the second highest mountain in Ethiopia) on the Sanetti Plateau and individual glaciers of considerable thickness <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> to 3,200 meters. As a consequence, the landscape as we see it today is the lava outpourings much modified by over 20 million years of erosion by water, wind and ice.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 X-rays and a CT scan {{revealed}} that Ötzi had an arrowhead lodged {{in his left}} shoulder when he died, and a matching small tear on his coat. The discovery of the arrowhead prompted researchers to theorize Ötzi died of blood loss from the wound, which {{would probably have been}} fatal even if modern medical techniques had been available. Further research found that the arrow's shaft had been removed before death, and close examination of the body found bruises and cuts to the hands, wrists and chest and cerebral trauma indicative of a blow to the head. One of the cuts was to the base of his thumb that <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> to the bone but had no time to heal before his death. Currently, it is believed that Ötzi bled to death after the arrow shattered the scapula and damaged nerves and blood vessels before lodging near the lung.|$|E
25|$|Wallonia had rich coalfields {{over much}} of its area, and the highly folded nature of coal seams meant {{that it could be}} found at {{relatively}} shallow depths. Deep mines were not required at first so there were a large number of small operations. There was a complex legal system for concessions, often multiple layers had different owners. Entrepreneurs started going deeper and deeper (thanks to the innovation of steam pumping). In 1790, the maximum depth of mines was 220 meters. By 1856, the average depth in the area west of Mons was 361, and in 1866, 437 meters and some pits had <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> 700 and 900 meters; one was 1,065 meters deep, probably the deepest coal mine in Europe at this time. Gas explosions were a serious problem, and Belgium had high fatality rates. By the late 19th century the seams were becoming exhausted and the steel industry was importing some coal from the Ruhr.|$|E

25|$|The early uniforms worn by Mongolian {{troops were}} their {{civilian}} clothing. Typical {{it consisted of}} a long blue padded cotton tunic that was worn which <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> to the ankles along with an ornage sash around the waist. Headgear was either a lambs' wool hat or a colored turban wrapped around the head. The color of the turban varied with each Mongol banner clan having a distinctive one. In addition they wore a leather bandolier for cartridges which was slung over the left shoulder. Some soldiers were dressed in loose fitting cotton jacket and trousers along with a peak cap. In 1936 a new uniform was in use, modeled on the Nationalist Chinese uniform. It included a loose-fitting grey jacket and grey cotton trousers. A peaked grey cotton peaked cap was worn along with it (similar in appearance to those worn by the Russian Imperial Army during World War I). Other uniforms they used included the regular Japanese Army uniform but with Inner Mongolian insignia.|$|E
25|$|In 1177, John led an {{invasion}} of Ulaid (an area roughly encompassing what is today County Antrim and County Down). He <b>reached</b> <b>Down</b> (modern day Downpatrick), drove off Ruaidrí Mac Duinn Sléibe, King of Ulaid (died 1201), consolidated his conquest, and ruled {{with a certain amount}} of independence for about a quarter of a century. Although the precise date of the marriage between John and Affrica is unknown, the union itself may well have attributed to his stunning successes in Ireland. Certainly, decades later in the reign of Guðrøðr's son and successor, Rǫgnvaldr (died 1229), John received significant military support from the Crovan dynasty, and it is not improbable that Guðrøðr himself supplied similar assistance. In the 1190s, John also received military assistance from Guðrøðr's kinsman Donnchad mac Gilla Brigte, Earl of Carrick (died 1250). Like Guðrøðr, Donnchad was a grandson of Fergus, and it possible that John's marriage to Affrica accounts for Donnchad's cooperation with him.|$|E

500|$|The {{existence}} of a cirque on the northwestern slope has been postulated.

However, during the Pleistocene glaciers <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> to [...] altitude on the northwestern slope. Lava flows have overrun some of the glaciated surfaces {{and it is possible}} that lava flows induced the melting of glaciers. A number of glacial landforms elsewhere were destroyed by mudflows during the time of Llullaillaco's last activity. Llullaillaco may not have been glaciated at all during the Pleistocene.|$|E

500|$|According {{to initial}} police statements, {{at this point}} {{one or more of}} the {{suspects}} began firing with semiautomatic handguns and Trooper Foerster fired four times before falling mortally wounded. At Acoli's trial, Harper testified that the gunfight started [...] "seconds" [...] after Foerster arrived at the scene. At this trial, Harper said that Foerster reached into the vehicle, pulled out and held up a semi-automatic pistol and ammunition magazine, and said [...] "Jim, look what I found", while facing Harper at the rear of the vehicle. At this point, Assata Shakur and Zayd Shakur were ordered to put their hands on their laps and not to move; Harper said that Assata Shakur then <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> to the right of her right leg, pulled out a pistol, and shot him in the shoulder, after which he retreated to behind his vehicle. Questioned by prosecutor C. Judson Hamlin, Harper said he saw Foerster shot just as Assata Shakur was felled by bullets from Harper's gun. Harper testified that Acoli shot Foerster with a [...]38 caliber semiautomatic pistol and then used Foerster's own gun to [...] "execute him". According to the testimony of State Police investigators, two jammed semi-automatic pistols were discovered near Foerster's body.|$|E
