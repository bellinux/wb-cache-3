500|$|Settlers {{would not}} only haul gravel for the new roadways, but they also cleared brush for the road allowance. [...] Early roads did not follow the road {{allowances}} of the Dominion Land Survey, but rather kept to higher ground, however {{due to the nature}} of the Boreal transition ecoregion, muskegs and swamps still needed to be traversed. [...] The first pioneers filled these watery areas with branches and brush and proceeded along their trip. [...] Later corduroy roads were built across these areas were traffic got mired in the mud. [...] A corduroy road consisted of logs laid across the road as a <b>rail</b> <b>tie</b> is across the rail line, however the logs were placed one against another and mud filled between the logs for a smoother surface. [...] One log provided about [...] of roadway, so only the worst areas were constructed in this fashion.|$|E
40|$|Railroad {{engineering}} {{practices and}} Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations require track to be inspected for physical defects at specified intervals, {{which may be}} as often as thrice per week. These inspections are conducted visually by railroad track inspectors, but due to practical considerations, only {{a certain level of}} detail and consistency can be obtained. Enhancements are possible using machine-vision technology, which consists of recording digital images of track elements and analyzing those images using custom algorithms to identify defects or their symptoms. Based on analysis of FRA accident data, discussion with railroad track engineering experts, consultation with Association of American Railroads researchers, and review of existing inspection technologies and methods, this project focuses on developing a machine-vision-based system to detect irregularities and defects in wood-tie fasteners, rail anchors, crib ballast, and turnout components. A Video Track Cart was developed for initial video data acquisition, and algorithms were developed to consistently detect the <b>rail,</b> <b>tie</b> plates, ties, cut spikes, rail anchors, and ballast using a global-to-local algorithmic approach. Using the detection algorithms on panoramas generated from the videos further increases their accuracy, with added benefit in using the panoramas to manually confirm the severity of defects if results are in doubt. Once defects have been detected and catalogued by the system, a quantitative comparison of data from different runs is possible, opening up possibilities for defect growth trending and predictive maintenance scheduling. Ultimately, this system will provide consistent, quantitative track inspection data for not only increasing current inspection capabilities, but also deepening the understanding of track health over time...|$|E

25|$|A {{railroad}} tie/railway tie/crosstie (North America) or railway sleeper (Britain, Ireland, Australasia, and Africa) is {{a rectangular}} {{support for the}} rails in railroad tracks. Generally laid perpendicular to the <b>rails,</b> <b>ties</b> transfer loads to the track ballast and subgrade, hold the rails upright and keep them spaced to the correct gauge.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{minimize}} the downtime to upgrade tracks, a track renewal train (TRT) can automate much of the process, replacing <b>rails,</b> <b>ties,</b> and ballast {{at the rate of}} 2 miles per day. In the United States, a TRT is used by Union Pacific Railroad on the track shared with future higher-speed rail service in Illinois area.|$|R

50|$|Restoration {{of one of}} Brooklyn's trolley/light rail routes, in Red Hook, was {{hampered}} due to the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) withdrawing {{its support}} from the project. The DOT identified several potential improvements which {{did not include a}} streetcar however, that would improve access and mobility for neighborhood residents. Construction was stopped on a 7-block extension to the line due to the removal and scrapping of <b>rails,</b> <b>ties,</b> and other items of railroad equipment by the DOT, which were stored on land that was slated for the Fairway supermarket project.|$|R

500|$|Shortly after {{entering}} New Paltz, the trail crosses a bridge over Plattekill Creek. The masonry for {{the bridge was}} completed by late June 1870, and trestle work was done by July. Originally made of wood, the bridge was accidentally set on fire in 1880 by ashes or sparks from a passing train. This prompted the railroad to coat its <b>rail</b> <b>ties</b> with tin while replacing its wooden bridges with ones made of stone. The bridge's original abutments were made of Shawangunk conglomerate. It was rebuilt in 1912, and crosses the Plattekill Creek at a height of [...] The Shawangunk Ridge is visible from the bridge.|$|R

50|$|Baker Mountain is a {{mountain}} ridge in southeastern Hampshire County, West Virginia. The mountain runs southwest northeast between Yellow Spring and the Hardy County line. Baker Mountain is flanked to its east by the Cacapon River with West Virginia Route 259 running {{parallel between the}} two. Its forests were once used as {{a major source of}} timber for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's <b>rail</b> <b>ties.</b> For this reason, the Winchester and Western Railroad was constructed through the Capon Valley in the 1920s to haul the timber harvested in the region to Winchester, Virginia for railroad tie production. The communities of Capon Lake and Intermont lie at the foot of Baker Mountain on the Cacapon.|$|R
50|$|According to what happened, the {{agreement}} infringed a national law that only allows the dismantle of rail tracks {{if they are}} destined for other railway line. Natura Ecology was hired directly with no bidding procedures and the company was also accused of having stolen the material. The <b>rail</b> <b>ties</b> were intercepted and seized by the local police in Trelew, totalizing four tracks with 100 tons of material with an estimated value of AR$1,000,000. Nevertheless, the rail profiles were never found. Some reports stated {{that they had been}} sent to different locations in Chubut, Greater Buenos Aires, Córdoba and even the city of Buenos Aires.

5000|$|The Pequaming mill was {{the first}} {{large-scale}} lumbering and milling operation in the Lake Superior region, and in the years between 1880 and 1900, the mill cut an average of over , [...] in boards and [...] in lath). When officials realized the white pine supply was nearly exhausted, they switched to hemlock and cedar. The pine was made into 1x4 lumber, the cedar into shingles, and hemlock into lath; other products included <b>rail</b> <b>ties</b> and hemlock bark for tanneries. For shipment, the products were loaded into box cars, which were placed onto scows and towed across the bay to Baraga, and then shipped by rail to their destinations. The original sawmill operated until 1887, when it burned in a fire of unknown origins, {{and was replaced by}} a larger mill within 60 days.|$|R
50|$|Building {{the line}} came in stages: first the {{surveyors}} (often with Army protection) Laid out the precise line {{to minimize the}} grade {{and the need for}} bridges and trestles. Then came the grading party with plows and shovels. Finally came the <b>ties</b> and the <b>rails,</b> along with the telegraph line, signals, sidings and switches. Starting in summer 1865 Omaha became the logistics base for thousands of tons of <b>rails,</b> <b>ties,</b> tools and supplies. As soon as a few miles of track was ready, supplies were moved to a forward supply point, and teams of horse-drawn or mule drawn wagons carried them to the work point. Eventually the teams could lay several miles of track today—the record was 10 miles. It was largely a pick-and-shovel and wheelbarrow job, with most of the unskilled work done by Irish immigrants.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Mississippi Tennessee Railnet {{was sold}} to Ironhorse Resources, Inc., who changed the name to Mississippi Tennessee Railroad (MTNR). A {{significant}} amount of track was abandoned under MTNR's ownership. In 2004 MTNR filed to abandon 43.2 mi of track from a point just south of New Albany down to Houston, citing low traffic volumes and expensive maintenance costs. In 2008, 16 mi of track from Middleton to Falkner was abandoned. The remaining track south of New Albany was used for car storage until 2010, when it was also abandoned. In October 2011, a spur to an industrial park north of New Albany was removed during the expansion of Mississippi Highway 15. In 2011, MTNR received financial support from the towns of Ripley and New Albany to make improvements to the line and began replacing <b>rail</b> <b>ties.</b>|$|R

50|$|The work {{included}} the first tools and machinery ever {{built in the}} United States for manufacturing tinplate track. The first year, as Ives {{was in a hurry}} to get track, a set of drop-hammers were made up for the <b>rails</b> and <b>ties.</b> The tinplate was first cut up into strips, and then placed under the drop-hammer. The next year Mr. Haberlin and Mr. Hayes made up regular dies for use in a punch press, which would cut the <b>rails</b> and <b>ties</b> out of sheet tin. Thirty thousand rails could be made in a day; a working day in 1902 being ten hours. Ives did not make a machine for rolling their rails until somewhat later (In 1907-1908, after Haberlin had left the Ives' Manufacturing Company to work for Sir Thomas Edison as a toolmaker/machinist with his brother John E.
