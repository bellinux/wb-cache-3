25|$|Lying to {{the east}} of Dunduff Farm on a rocky knoll, this tower castle was built to an L-shaped plan, with a square three floored stair-tower in the <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angle</b> on the south. Three barrel-vaulted {{chambers}} are on the ground floor and these were accessed via the lobby of the tower. A private chamber on the first floor was accessed by a corridor that ran the length of the main block. A fireplace in the wing heated the hall, with its splayed window embrasure. An intermediate floor once existed, as indicated by joist sockets. Window and door features of the original ruin suggest construction in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.|$|E
60|$|The Baronet {{pocketed}} his note-book, stared {{through an}} eye-glass, and then waved his stick; and he on his side, and the Countess and the Prince on theirs, advanced with somewhat quicker steps. They {{met at the}} <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angle,</b> where a thin stream sprayed across a boulder and was scattered in rain among the brush; and the Baronet saluted the Prince with much punctilio. To the Countess, on the other hand, he bowed {{with a kind of}} sneering wonder.|$|E
60|$|A {{glance at}} the map of Europe will show the reader the {{peculiar}} weakness of the empire. The river Danube comes down to within {228} {{a couple of hundred}} miles of the Adriatic Sea in the region of what is now Bosnia and Serbia. It makes a square <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angle</b> there. The Romans never kept their sea communications in good order, and this two hundred mile strip of land was their line of communication between the western Latin-speaking part of the empire and the eastern Greek-speaking portion. Against this square angle of the Danube the barbarian pressure was greatest. When they broke through there it was inevitable that the empire should fall into two parts.|$|E
5000|$|In plan, {{the temple}} is a square {{with a number}} of {{graduated}} projections in the middle of each side giving a cruciform shape {{with a number of}} <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angles</b> on each side.|$|R
50|$|A strong joint, {{the tongue}} and groove joint is widely used for <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angles.</b> The effect of wood {{shrinkage}} is concealed when the joint is beaded or otherwise moulded. In expensive cabinet work, glued dovetail and multiple {{tongue and groove}} are used.|$|R
5000|$|The plan of {{the castle}} is highly unusual. The main block of the castle has three storeys, and a garret. [...] The wing, one storey higher, and topped by a watch-tower, {{projects}} eastward from the main block {{in a way that}} creates two <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angles.</b> [...] A semicircular stair tower rises in the south-west angle.|$|R
60|$|The bay {{immediately}} opposite Equator Town, {{which we}} called Fu Bay, {{in honour of}} our cook, was thus fortified on either horn. It was well sheltered by the reef, the enclosed water clear and tranquil, the enclosing beach curved like a horseshoe, and both steep and broad. The path debouched about {{the midst of the}} <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angle,</b> the woods stopping some distance inland. In front, between the fringe of the wood and the crown of the beach, there had been designed a regular figure, like the court for some new variety of tennis, with borders of round stones imbedded, and pointed at the angles with low posts, likewise of stone. This was the king's Pray Place. When he prayed, what he prayed for, and to whom he addressed his supplications I could never learn. The ground was tapu.|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} now arose--Where should the river be crossed? Sir Redvers Buller possessed {{the whole of}} the Hlangwani plateau, which, as the reader may perceive by looking at the map opposite p. 448, fills up the <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angle</b> made opposite Pieters by the Tugela after it leaves Colenso. From this Hlangwani plateau he could either cross the river where it ran north and south or where it ran east and west. Sir Redvers Buller determined to cross the former reach beyond Colenso village. To do this he had to let go his hold on the Monte Cristo ridge and resign all the advantages which its possession had given him, and had besides to descend into the low ground, where his army must be cramped between the high hills on its left and the river on its right.|$|E
5000|$|House of Schivas {{is a tall}} tower house. A modern {{courtyard}} surrounds it, {{replacing the}} original. A wide circular stair tower projecting from the north front of the main block gives access to all floors, while a stair tower in the <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angle</b> rises from the first floor level. [...] There is a modern timber <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angle</b> turret.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{referred}} to as an L-plan castle, it may be better described as two offset wings joined at the corner. [...] One wing has five storeys and an attic, while the other has three, their connection being a projecting square tower, which has a bartizan, and is topped by a garbled watch-chamber. [...] this creates two <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angles.</b> [...] There have been extensions since the castle was originally built, including a two-storey 18th-centuryaddition to the north gable.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is unusual for an Italian Renaissance design. Triangular in plan {{to fit the}} street plan and the bluff. There is a four-story circular tower on the north, which widens {{in a series of}} curves and <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angles</b> to become a conventional four-story rectangular plan. The rectangular section was demolished in 1975. The remaining structure is three stories in height. A bracketed entablature continued around the tower, separating the three lower stories from the top floor and the lantern above.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Z-plan {{part of the}} Castle of Colliston {{was erected}} in 1583. It consists of a main block with two round towers projecting at opposite corners, and a stair turret rising {{in one of the}} <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angles</b> between the main block and tower. This tower, which also houses the entrance to the castle, is corbelled out at the top to form a gabled watch-chamber. The plan is similar to Claypotts Castle and is amply provided with wide splayed gun-loops and circular shot-holes for defence. The wall heads and the entire upper storey were remodelled at several times and are not original.|$|R
5000|$|In the <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angle</b> is {{the arched}} {{entrance}} doorway. Above, for its defence, is a heavily corbelled projection, with machicolations to allow missiles to be dropped, while {{to the side}} there is a shot-hole. [...] On a panel above the doorway are the quartered arms of the Gordons, with the date 1586 and the initials I.G. and H.G. [...] A semicircular stair tower rises above the doorway in the <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E

50|$|At the {{south-east}} {{angle is}} a large drum tower, which has a rounded gable. The original entry was in the <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angle</b> with the square tower.|$|E
2500|$|The {{location}} was {{known from the}} end of the 18th century as the Château Jouan, occupied by a Vauban-era round tower. In 1883 a Séré de Rivières system fortification was begun on the massif, called the Fort du Janus. Work continued until 1889 with a blockhouse in top of the position and a rock-cut battery in the face of the mountain, which housed four 95mm naval guns. In 1891-92 the blockhouse was expanded to two levels for a barracks, and from 1898 to 1906 a subterranean barracks was excavated. [...] The whole was surrounded by a perimeter wall. The fort was armed with six guns on the ramparts in addition to the four naval guns in their unique casemate, which was added between 1898 and 1906. The garrison was 120 men. The perimeter was laid out with <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angles</b> to sweep the walls with fields of fire.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{innovative}} numerical method named as line element-less method, LEM, for finding solution of torsion {{problem has been}} extended to all shaped sections, including sections possessing <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angles</b> at their boundary. The response solution in terms of shear stress field or Prandtl function or warping function in all domain and {{for any kind of}} domain with arbitrary contour, may be performed quickly, calculating line integrals only. The method takes full advantage of the theory of analytic complex function and is robust in the sense that returns exact solution if this exists. Numerical implementation of LEM has been developed using Mathematica software without resorting to any discretization neither in the domain nor in the boundary. The latter means that you can use the same program for all sections just by changing the first few lines of program where you declare the geometry of the section. Some numerical applications have been reported to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the method. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The main {{difficulty}} {{in solving the}} Helmholtz equation within polygons is due to non-analytic vertices. By using a method nearly identical to that used by Fox, Henrici, and Moler in their 1967 paper; it is demonstrated that such eigenvalue calculations can be extended to unprecedented precision, very often to well over a hundred digits, and sometimes to over a thousand digits. A curious observation is that as one increases the number of terms in the eigenfunction expansion, the approximate eigenvalue may be made to alternate {{above and below the}} exact eigenvalue. This alternation provides a new method to bound eigenvalues, by inspection. Symmetry must be exploited to simplify the geometry, reduce the number of non-analytic vertices and disentangle degeneracies. The symmetry-reduced polygons considered here have at most one non-analytic vertex from which all edges can be seen. Dirichlet, Neumann, and periodic-type edge conditions, are independently imposed on each polygon edge. The full shapes include the regular polygons and some with <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angles</b> (cut-square, L-shape, 5 -point star). Thousand-digit results are obtained for the lowest Dirichlet eigenvalue of the L-shape, and regular pentagon and hexagon. Comment: 22 page...|$|R
5000|$|The tower, {{which stood}} in a {{commanding}} position, had three storeys and a garret, with a semi-octagonal stair tower in the <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angle.</b> The original doorway was {{at the foot of}} the stair tower.|$|E
50|$|A wide scale-and-platt stair {{leads from}} the {{entrance}} to the first floor; whence other floors may be reached by way of a turnpike stair in the <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angle.</b> The hall, and an adjoining chamber, are on the first floor.|$|E
50|$|Beneath {{the stair}} {{is a small}} chamber which accesses an east-facing gunloop. The broad turnpike stair leads up to the hall level, from which a smaller stair accesses the upper storeys. This stair is built into a corbelled turret in the <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The temple {{is based}} on a very {{original}} 24-pointed uninterrupted [...] (star shaped) plan and uses soapstone as its basic building material. Contemporary stellate plans of the Bhumija shrines in central India from where the inspiration for this temple came from, were all 32-pointed interrupted types. No temples of the 6-, 12-, or 24-pointed stellate plans are known to exist in Karnataka or Maharashtra, {{with the exception of the}} Doddabasappa temple, which can be described as a 24-pointed uninterrupted plan. In an 'interrupted' stellate plan, the stellate outline is interrupted by orthogonal (right-angle) projections in the cardinal directions, resulting in star points that have been skipped.The Doddabasappa temple marks the mature development of the Chalukyan art which originated from basic dravida architecture of South India. Its departure from conventional dravida plan used in the Virupaksha temple in Pattadakal is so extreme that it would be very difficult to find similarities without detailed examination. A star shape is obtained by rotating a square about its centre. The star points form equidistant projections. The <b>angles</b> and <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angles</b> thus formed make the perimeter of the outerwall of the shrine.|$|R
40|$|Some {{observations}} on the mineralogy and genesis of braunite ALTHOUGH braunite 3 Mn 20 3 -MnSiO 3 is best known from its occurrence in regionally meta-morphosed manganese deposits uch as the gon-dites and kodurites of India (Roy, 1981) it also occurs in hydrothermal veins (Frenzel, 1980) and in unmetamorphosed sediments (De La Hunty, 1963). A minor occurrence in the lower Cretaceous sedimentary manganese ores of Groote Eylandt is interesting as it indicates a sabkha-type origin for the mineral, and suggests a possible origin {{for the presence of}} small amounts of boron commonly found in braunite. The presence of braunite was first noted by the writer in 1975 (Ostwald, 1980). The occurrence of irregular zones of braunite around sand grains in manganiferous clays suggested that it was a reaction product, possibly produced during sedi-mentation of MnO 2 colloids. Occurrences of skele-tal crystals in dense cryptomelane were more difficult to explain. Recently further occurrences of braunite and cryptomelane showing chevron layer-ing have been noted and examined. Typical occur-rences are shown in fig. 1. Under the optical microscope braunite is brown-ish grey against pale grey cryptomelane, and it commonly occurs as parallel, tabular layers alter-nating with cryptomelane, and with definite angular morphology. Fortification-type structures also occur, with <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angles</b> common. The chemical compositions of the braunite and F 1 G. 1.

40|$|Multiple-beam Interferometry {{has been}} applied {{to the study of the}} surface {{topography}} of natural and synthetic quartz crystals. It is shown that the principal habit faces (major rhombohedron R. minor rhombohedron r. and prism m) consist of a number or 'growth pyramids', which are produced by the spreading of multimolecular growth sheets In succession from several initiating centres. A description if given of the properties of these sheets (height, edge structure etc.) on the R faces, and of the vicinal faces constituting the sides of the growth pyramids. There are two respects in which the vicinal faces depart from the condition of being strictly plane. - They possess a cylindrical curvature with a radius of several metres and their inclination to the close-packed plane increases towards the summit of the growth pyramid. From the Interpretation of the results the mechanism of growth of the R faces is determined, and estimates are obtained of the mean distance of diffusion of adsorbed molecules and of the size of the theoretical two-dimensional nucleus. The general features of the minor rhombohedron faces are similar to those of the R faces. Differences arise due to the greater irregularity of the growth fronts of the r faces, and this is probably connected with their greater rate ofspreading. The topography of natural prism faces is briefly described, and the origin of the atriations on these faces. Two types of synthetic crystal have been studied; seeds with a thin layer (order of one wavelength) of synthetic growth, and crystals with a om. or more of synthetic growth. The observations on these crystals indicate that growth initially takes place from a large number of growth nuclei of the order of but that as growth proceeds, most of these nuclei becomes Inactive and ultimately growth takes place from relatively few dominant centres. Evidence is given for the existence of screw dislocations in quarts; and from the observations on natural and synthetic crystals it is concluded that fresh sheets are Initiated by screw dislocations, by the <b>re-entrant</b> <b>angles</b> associated with twinned faces and, possibly, by foreign particles. <p...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM) {{limit of the}} Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT) equations for steady planar flow around re-entrant comers. The PTT equations give the UCM equations {{in the limit of}} vanishing model parameter kappa, this dimensionless parameter being associated with the quadratic stress terms in the PTT model. The critical length scale local to the comer is r = O(kappa (1 / 2 (1 -alpha))) as kappa -> 0, where pi/alpha a is the <b>re-entrant</b> comer <b>angle</b> with alpha is an element of [1 / 2, 1) and r the radial distance. On distances far smaller than this we obtain the PTT kappa = 1 problem, whilst on distances greater (but still small) we obtain the UCM problem kappa = 0. This critical length scale is that on which intermediate behaviour of the PTT model is obtained where both linear and quadratic stress terms are present in the wall boundary layer equations. The double limit kappa -> 0, r -> 0 thus yields a nine region local asymptotic structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{free vibration}} of annular sector plates with various boundary conditions is studied {{by means of}} the Chebyshev-Ritz method. The analysis is based on the three-dimensional small strain linear elasticity theory. The product of Chebyshev polynomials satisfying the necessary boundary conditions is selected as admissible functions {{in such a way that}} the governing eigenvalue equation can be conveniently derived through an optimization process by the Ritz method. The boundary functions guarantee the satisfaction of the geometric boundary conditions of the plates and the Chebyshev polynomials provide the robustness for numerical calculation. The present study provides a full vibration spectrum for the thick annular sector plates, which cannot be given by the two-dimensional (2 -D) theories such as the Mindlin theory. Comprehensive numerical results with high accuracy are systematically produced, which can be used as benchmark to evaluate other numerical methods. The effect of radius ratio, thickness ratio and sector angle on natural frequencies of the plates with a sector angle from 120 ° to 360 ° is discussed in detail. The three-dimensional vibration solutions for plates with a <b>re-entrant</b> sector <b>angle</b> (larger than 180 °) and shallow helicoidal shells (sector angle larger than 360 °) with a small helix angle are presented for the first time. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is considered {{in the absence of}} a solvent viscosity, under which a class of self-similar solutions has been identified with stress singularities of O(r− 2 (1 − α)) and stream function behaviour O(r α (1 + α)) (r being the radial distance from the corner). The asymptotic analysis is completed by providing a solution for the downstream boundary layer using natural stress variables. We show that the matching of the outer (core) solution into the downstream boundary layer imposes a restriction on the range of α ε (2 / 3, 1) for which these self-similar solutions are applicable, i. e. they only hold for corner angles between 180 ◦ and 270 ◦...|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} in 1962 {{of a single}} specimen of Polygonum maritimum L. on drift material washed ashore at the north coast of the isle of Noord-Beveland {{gives rise to a}} discussion of its taxonomical, geographical and ecological characteristics. The species has never been found in the Netherlands before. An enumeration of the taxonomical features of P. maritimum and a comparison with those of P. aviculare L. agg. and of the allied taxa P. raii Babingt. and P. oxyspermum Mey. & Bge. is given. The mediterranean-atlantic species P. maritimum reaches its north-eastern limit on the continent in the French counties Manche and Calvados, in England in the counties Somerset and Hampshire. Thus the locality in the Netherlands is situated about 400 km north-east of this limit. It must be accepted that diaspores can be transported over this distance among drift material of southern origin. In the phytocoenological system of the French-Swiss school P. maritimum is a faithful taxon of the mediterranean-atlantic alliance Euphorbion peplis growing on drift material washed ashore. However, at the european-atlantic coast the species penetrates into the Atriplicetum sabulosae, an association of the alliance Salsolo-Honckenyon peploidis which vicariates with the former alliance in northern regions. A vegetation record of the locality in Noord-Beveland is given. While discussing the ecology of P. maritimum special attention is devoted to the combination of leveling and differentiating aspects of the habitat of tidal drift belts in relation to forces from the outside. The starting-point of this view forms the stimulating train of thought of VAN LEEUWEN (21, 22) who takes the line that in each relation — including the ordering relations forming the base of organization and formation of structures or patterns, both inherent to life — elements of communication and isolation can be distinguished. The leveling elements or elements of communication with forces from the outside are represented by the regular supply of organic material (tidal drift) and sea-salts. The spatial differentiating or isolating elements consist of a relative shelter against wind-blown sand and sand thrown up by floodwater and of a limitation in the composition of the tidal drift to prevailing brown algae. Along our beaches the aspect of shelter can only be realized at coasts with a very differentiating structure {{in the direction of the}} coast-line, viz. by <b>re-entrant</b> and salient <b>angles.</b> The habitat in the Netherlands shows these characteristics, as well as the habitats of P. maritimum described in literature. From the view-point of nature conservancy it is of the utmost importance that coasts showing the above mentioned structure in the direction of the coast-line are not interfered with...|$|R
