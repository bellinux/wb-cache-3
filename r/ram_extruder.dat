40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{a large portion of the}} pyrite {{particles}} in the coal seams of the Illinois Basin are finely disseminated within the coal matrix. In order to liberate these micron size pyrite particles, one must use a fine grinding operation. The ultrafine coal particles are difficult to dewater and create problems in coal transportation, as well as in storage and handling at utility plants. The objective of this research project is to combine the ultrafine coal dewatering and briquetting processes into a single stage operation. This will be accomplished by the use of bitumen based emulsions for dewatering and a compaction device for briquetting. During this reporting period, several types of coal samples with various particle size distributions have been tested for use in the dewatering and briquetting processes. Furthermore, various bitumen emulsions have been tested to determine the optimum dewatering reagent. These dewatering and pelletizing tests were carried out using a lab-scale <b>ram</b> <b>extruder.</b> Discharge from the dewatering and briquetting processes was tested to determine compliance with current federal and state requirements. The influence of bitumen emulsion on the sulfur content of coal pellets made were also examined. In addition, a <b>ram</b> <b>extruder</b> which can be operated continuously to simulate a rotary press operation, has been built and is currently being tested for use in the fine coal dewatering and pelletizing process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Co-extrasion {{involves}} extrasion {{of multiple}} layers {{at the same}} time. Functionally graded materials comprising various layers with different properties can be produced through co-extrusion. Rheological control is vital for successful co-extrusion of layered cement-based materials. The paste flow in the barrel and the die land in a <b>ram</b> <b>extruder</b> should be plug-like, while the paste should be sheared and uniformly elongated in the die entry region. In this work, the rheology of the layered pastes was adjusted by changing the water content in each layer. An economical method using thin-wall tubes was effective to prepare layered feedrod of cementitious paste. The functionally graded cellular structures of cement-based materials were successfully fabricated by co-extrusion at a low extrudate velocity. Inspections showed that the roundness perpendicular to the extrusion direction, and the straightness parallel to the extrusion direction between layers were well preserved after extrusion. The transition between layers was gradual, which is critical for functionally graded materials...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{suitability}} as {{rapid release}} dosage forms for ibuprofen of cylindrically shaped extrudates based on Gelucire 50 / 13 and Polyethylene glycol 4000 was investigated. Several drug to carrier weight ratios were processed in a small-scale <b>ram</b> <b>extruder</b> at a temperature {{much lower than}} the melting point of the binders. Cylindrical extrudates, regular in shape and with a smooth surface were obtained. In the Gelucire 50 / 13 /ibuprofen extrudates, only a slight reduction of drug crystallinity compared to the relative physical blends was found, which in any case, did not affect the stability of the systems. While in the Gelucire case the ibuprofen dissolution was improved even by a little percentage of carrier in the formulation, with Polyethylene glycol 4000 the introduction of additional hydrophilic excipients was found to be necessary to achieve a dissolution rate and extent of dissolution of the drug comparable to those of Gelucire/ibuprofen systems...|$|E
40|$|International audienceExtrusion is {{a common}} forming process {{for a wide range}} of {{materials}} (food, polymer, clay, metal), although it is not yet a common way to form cement-based materials on an industrial scale. This is both explained by the heterogeneity (large range of grain size) and the specific rheological behaviour (frictional behaviour due to high solid volume fraction) of such materials. Recent studies have highlighted the predominance of the filtration phenomenon during the extrusion flow of firm cement-based materials. Such a filtration leads to process blockage and prohibits its utilisation in industrial settings. In the present study the introduction of a vibration system to the extruder in order to inprove the extrusion flow was investigated. The effects of such external excitation on the rheological behaviour of a firm extrudible cement-based paste (yield stress reduction without losing retaining shape properties) were examined and some extrusion tests (<b>ram</b> and screw <b>extruders)</b> were performed to show the potential of a vibration/extrusion coupling...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{results of}} an {{experimental}} study on the mix design and the characterization of extrudable reactive powder concrete (ERPC) are presented. Five concrete mixes were prepared with variable amounts of polycarboxylate superplasticizer (SP), silica fume (SF) and crushed quartz (CQ). The extrudability of the ERPC was first demonstrated through extrusion tests performed with a <b>ram</b> <b>extruder</b> at different compression speeds. Then, {{the influence of the}} dosages in SP, SF and CQ on early-age hydration rate, autogenous shrinkage, 28 -days mechanical performances, gas permeability, total porosity and chloride penetration rate was quantified. The increase in SP dosage caused a retardation of hydration and an increase of early-age autogenous shrinkage. Moreover, the partial substitution of silica fume with crushed quartz had a positive effect on hydration rate, autogenous shrinkage and mechanical properties. This result was mainly attributed to a higher amount of water available for cement hydration, induced by the coarser particle size distribution of crushed quartz as compared with silica fume...|$|E
40|$|Co-extrusion {{involves}} simultaneous extrusion {{of multiple}} layers {{and can be}} used to produce functionally graded materials whose layers have different properties. Rheological control is vital for successful co-extrusion. During extrusion, flow in the barrel and die land in a <b>ram</b> <b>extruder</b> should be plug-like, while the paste should be sheared and uniformly elongated in the die entry region. In the barrel of the extruder, the paste flow velocity field was inferred by direct observation of the paste left in the barrel, and evidence for plug flow in the barrel was seen only at low-extrudate velocities. In the die land, the Benbow nonlinear model was employed to assess the paste flow behavior, and plug flow was achieved only when the shear stress applied to the paste by the die land wall was smaller than its yield stress. For co-extrusion, a simple method using thin-walled tubes was found to be effective to prepare layered feedrods. Functionally graded cellular structures of cement-based materials were successfully co-extruded by using a low-extrudate velocity when the paste had decreasing shear viscosity from inner to outer layers...|$|E
40|$|Extrusion of solid-liquid {{particulate}} pastes is {{a well-established}} process in industry for continuously forming products of defined cross-sectional shape. At low extrusion velocities, the solids and liquid phases can separate due to drainage of liquid through the interparticle pores, termed liquid phase migration (LPM). The effect of wall friction, die shape and extrusion speed on LPM in a cylindrically axisymmetric <b>ram</b> <b>extruder</b> is investigated using a two-dimensional {{finite element model}} of paste extrusion based on soil mechanics principles (modified Cam-Clay). This extends the smooth walled model reported by Patel et al. (2007) to incorporate a simplified Tresca wall friction condition. Three die entry angles (90 °, 60 ° and 45 °) and two extrusion speeds are considered. The extrusion pressure is predicted to increase with the Tresca friction factor {{and the extent of}} LPM is predicted to increase with decreasing ram speed (both as expected). The effects of wall friction on LPM are shown to be dictated by the die shape and ram displacement: there are few general rules relating extruder design and operating conditions to extent of LPM, so that finite element-based simulation is likely to be needed to predict the onset of LPM accurately.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to tailor a drug release profile through the adjustment of some key processing parameters involved in melt-extrusion: die temperature, shear rate, die length and drug particle size. Two experimental designs were selected, namely a 2 -level full factorial design to examine the effects and significance of the processing factors, and a central composite design of the surface responses to find the best set of factor levels to obtain given specifications of drug release. Extrudates of poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) and phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride were prepared using a <b>ram</b> <b>extruder.</b> Drug release profiles from the matrix systems were fitted using a power law, for which a new mathematical expression of a burst release was provided. The burst release and exponent were selected as the responses. The processing factors had a drastic influence on the drug release. Within the domain that was investigated, the burst release and the exponent varied from 6 to 54 % and 0. 1 to 0. 4, respectively, resulting in a time requires for 50 % drug release extending from hours to weeks. These results demonstrated the possibilities of modulating the release profile by means of the processing parameters rather than through the classical approach of altering the formulation...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we have {{developed}} hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffolds for synthetic bone graft from nano-sized HA particles using ceramic extrusion. We also demonstrate that these HA scaffolds show enhanced compressive strength (29. 4 MPa), whilst possessing large pore sizes (> 600 µm) that are suitable for bone grafting. The extrusion process involved forming a ceramic paste by mixing the HA powder with a binder and distilled water. The ceramic paste was then fabricated using a <b>ram</b> <b>extruder</b> that was fitted with a honeycomb die to impart large, structured pores. Several green bodies were extruded and then subjected to the same drying and thermal debinding treatment. The samples underwent three different sintering temperatures and two varied dwell times, {{in order to determine}} the optimum sintering parameters. The scaffolds were then analysed for their chemical, physical, mechanical and biological properties to elucidate the effects of the sintering parameters on extruded HA scaffolds. The results revealed that the nano-sized particles exhibited a high sinterability, and XRD analysis showed phase purity until 1300 oC. At 1300 oC, trace amounts of phase impurities were detected, however, scaffolds sintered at this temperature exhibited the highest mean compressive strength. The findings demonstrated that traces of phase impurities were not detrimental to the scaffold’s compressive strength. In addition, scanning electron microscopy and density measurements revealed a highly densified solid phase was attained...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the ongoing ICCI coal {{preparation}} research project is to reduce ash and sulfur content in coal by using fine grinding and other coal cleaning processes. The ultrafine coal particles that result from the grinding and cleaning operations are difficult to dewater, and create problems in their storage, handling and transportation. The objective {{of this research is}} to combine the dewatering and briquetting processes of fine coal preparation into a single stage operation, thereby enhancing the economic viability of utilizing fine coal. A bitumen based emulsion, Orimulsion, has proven to be an effective hydrophobic binder, which helps not only with the briquetting process but also in the expulsion of water from the coal. Encouraging results from the use of a <b>ram</b> <b>extruder</b> briquetting device led to experimentation in the production of briquettes using a lab scale roll briquetting device. In {{the first quarter of this}} reporting year, a commercially available lab scale roll briquetting machine was employed (Komarek B- 100). Further testing was conducted for the rest of the year with the use of a pilot scale model (Komarek B 220 -A). Briquettes were produced and evaluated by comparing results developed by adjusting various parameters of the briquetting machines and feed material. Results further substantiate previous findings that curing time dictates both moisture content and strengths of briquettes, and slower roll speeds produce more robust briquettes. A statistical model was set up to determine the optimal range of operating parameters. The statistical model generated from these results provided basic relationships between the roll speed and briquette form pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{potential}} use of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as matrix-forming mate-rial for tablets and extrudates. Raw materials were characterized for size, size distribution, and shape. Tablets with 2 - and 10 -mm diameter were prepared by direct compression at both 13 and 38 MPa from mixtures with poly(ethylene oxide) s, a model drug (propranolol hydrochloride) and lactose. To these mixtures water was added (16 %– 43 %) prior to extrusion in a <b>ram</b> <b>extruder</b> fit with different dies (1 -, 3 -, 6 -, and 9 -mm diameter and 4 -mm length). Tablets and extrudates were characterized for work of compression or extrusion, respectively, relaxation, tensile strength, friability, and drug release. Both PEOs produced tablets easily and with different properties. Some relaxation was observed, particularly for tablets with higher amounts of PEOs. Release of the drug occurred after swelling of the matrix, and between 10 % and 70 % drug released, a quasi zero-order release was observed for large tablets. Extrusion was possible for formulations with PEO only with amounts of water between 16 % and 50 %. Both radial and axial relaxation of both plugs and extrudates were observed. Moreover, different extrusion profiles reflected the different behaviors of the different formulations. The model drug was released in the same fashion as observed for the tablets. It was possible to produce tablets by direct compression and extrudates or pellets from those extrudates from different formulations with PEO. Tablets and pellets have shown distinct properties depending upon the PEO considered. Extrusion was particularly complex with different formulations with PEO...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{application}} of melt extrusion {{for the development of}} an oral retard formulation with a precise drug release over time. Since adjusting the formulation appears to be of the utmost importance in achieving the desired drug release patterns, different formulations of laminar extrudates were prepared according to the principles of Experimental Design, using a design for mixtures to assess the influence of formulation composition on the in vitro drug release from the extrudates after 1 h and after 8 h. The effect of each component on the two response variables was also studied. Ternary mixtures of theophylline (model drug), monohydrate lactose and microcrystalline wax (as thermoplastic binder) were extruded in a lab scale vertical <b>ram</b> <b>extruder</b> in absence of solvents at a temperature below the melting point of the binder (so that the crystalline state of the drug could be maintained), through a rectangular die to obtain suitable laminar systems. Thanks to the desirability approach and a reliability study for ensuring the quality of the formulation, a very restricted optimal zone was defined within the experimental domain. Among the mixture components, the variation of microcrystalline wax content played the most significant role in overall influence on the in vitro drug release. The formulation theophylline:lactose:wax, 57 : 14 : 29 (by weight), selected based on the desirability zone, was subsequently used for in vivo studies. The plasma profile, obtained after oral administration of the laminar extruded system in hard gelatine capsules, revealed the typical trend of an oral retard formulation. The application of the mixture experimental design associated to a desirability function permitted to optimize the extruded system and to determine the composition space that ensures final product quality. 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the current coal {{preparation}} research {{is to reduce the}} ash and sulfur content from coal, using fine grinding and various coal cleaning processes to separate finely disseminated mineral matter and pyrite from coal. Small coal particles are produced by the grinding operation, thus the ultrafine coal becomes very difficult to dewater. In addition, the ultrafine coal also creates problems during its transportation, storage and handling at utility plants. The current research is seeking to combine ultrafine coal dewatering and briquetting processes into a single stage operation, using hydrophobic binders as coal dewatering and binding reagents {{with the help of a}} compaction device. From previous tests, it has been found that coal pellets with a moisture content of less than 15 % and good wear and water resistance can be successfully fabricated at pressures of less than 6, 000 psi using a lab scale <b>ram</b> <b>extruder.</b> The primary objective of the research described in this quarter has been to extend the lab scale ultrafine coal dewatering and briquetting process into a pilot scale operation, based on the test data obtained from earlier research. A standard roller briquetting machine was used to dewater fine coal-binder mixtures during the briquetting process. The operating parameters, including moisture content of feed, feed rate, and roller speed, were evaluated on the basis of the performance of the briquettes. Briquettes fabricated at rates of up to 108 pellets per minute exhibited satisfactory water and wear resistance, i. e., less than 7. 5 % cured moisture and less than 8. 3 % weight loss after 6 min. of tumbling. Also, coal-binder samples with moisture contents of 40 percent have been successfully dewatered and briquetted. Briquetting of fine coal was possible under current feeding conditions, however, a better feeding system must be designed to further improve the quality of dewatered coal briquettes...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to use a <b>ram</b> <b>extruder</b> to prepare directly a fast release dosage form with uniform shape and density, containing carbamazepine (C) as a water-insoluble drug and polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG) as a low melting binder. The potential inclusion of lactose (L) as a hydrophilic filler was also considered. The temperature suitable to ensure a successful extrusion process of several formulations containing PEG in different percentages was found to be below the melting point of the PEG. The influence of composition on the extrusion process of different ram speeds was checked by measuring the pressure at the steady state, the apparent shear rate and the apparent shear stress of a range of mixtures of drug, lactose and PEG. The physical–mechanical properties of extrudates, including tensile strength and Young’s modulus, prepared with different ram velocities were also determined. The solid-state physical structure by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was established. The dissolution of the extrudates and their corresponding physical mixtures were compared. The mixtures were found to be shear thinning when extruded; the tensile strength of extrudates was dependent on the composition but not the extrusion rate, while the value of Young’s modulus was strongly influenced by the rate of extrusion, but less affected by the composition of the extrudates. The results of DSC and XRD indicated that the solid structure of the extrudates corresponded to that of a physical mixture of the components, hence there had been no change in the physical form of the drug induced by extrusion. In terms of dissolution, the rate of the extrusion process did not influence the performance of the products, whereas the composition did. The extruded mixtures of an equivalent composition exhibited a more rapid release than a simple physical mixture. The addition of lactose reduced the dissolution rate. q 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Biomedical Tissue Engineering, Biomaterials, and Medical Devices Poster SessionBioactive {{glasses are}} {{promising}} materials for bone scaffolds {{due to their}} ability to assist in tissue regeneration. When implanted in vivo, bioactive glasses can convert to hydroxyapatite, the main mineral constituent of human bone and form a strong bond with the surrounding tissues, providing an advantage over polymer scaffold materials. Bone scaffold fabrication using additive manufacturing (solid freeform fabrication) methods provides control over design and fabrication of pores in the scaffold. 13 - 93 bioglass (manufactured by Mo-Sci Corporation), a third-generation bioactive and resorbable material designed to accelerate the body's natural ability to heal itself, was used in the research described herein to fabricate bone scaffolds using two different additive manufacturing methods - Selective Laser Sintering and Freeze Extrusion Fabrication. Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is a process where a laser light is controlled to selectively sinter the particles in a powder bed layer-by-layer to fabricate a 3 D part based on a CAD model. The SLS machine used in this research was a DTM Sinterstation 2000. 13 - 93 bioglass mixed with stearic acid (as the polymer binder) by ball milling was used as the powder feedstock for the SLS machine. The fabricated green scaffolds underwent binder burnout to remove the stearic acid binder and then sintered at temperatures between 6500 C and 7000 C. After sintering, the scaffolds were mechanically tested, achieving a maximum compressive strength of 16 MPa for scaffolds with 60 % apparent porosity. Bioactivity results showed the ability of the SLS scaffolds to support the growth of osteoblastic cells. Scanning electron microsocopy analysis and MTT formazan formation measurements provided evidence that the bioglass scaffolds fabricated by the SLS process offer a surface capable of supporting robust cell growth. Freeze Extrusion Fabrication (FEF) is a process where an aqueous-based glass paste is extruded and deposited layer-by-layer to fabricate a 3 D part in a sub-freezing temperature environment. The FEF system, developed at Missouri S&T, consists of a 3 -axis positioning system, a <b>ram</b> <b>extruder</b> for paste extrusion, and position and force sensors for measurement and control. Bioglass slurry was prepared by ball milling 13 - 93 bioglass particles along with a dispersant (surfynol) and a binder (aquazol). Further, a lubricant (PEG- 400) was added to the paste to aid in extrusion. The bioglass slurry was then heated to obtain bioglass paste. Scaffolds with varying pore sizes from 300 μm to 800 μm were successfully fabricated using the FEF process. Post processing of green scaffolds, including binder burnout and sintering, is currently being performed. Scaffolds produced by the FEF process will be evaluated and compared with the scaffolds obtained using the SLS process...|$|E
40|$|The {{pesticide}} {{contamination of}} water is increasing {{as a result of}} intensive farming (Hermosin et al., 2013) and it makes necessary to develop low-cost systems for water purification, as to be used at farm houses and small agroindustries. Clays are good adsorbents for pesticides. Due to their small size, expansive properties reactive surfaces and modification or “tunning” ability (Hermosin & Cornejo, 1992; Socias-Viciana et al., 1998; Cruz-Guzmán et al., 2005; Gámiz et al., 2015) and thus they have been proposed for water treatment (Beall 2003). In this work we assay and propose clays as adsorbent component in a filter to remove pesticides from water. The modified clays were prepared from a low value clay (CTI, smectite content, 30 %) located in Bailén (Jaen, Spain) by saturation with Fe 3 + (CTI-FE) and hexadecyltrimethyllammonium (CTI-HDTMA). A commercial organo-clay, Cloisite 10 A (Clo, from BKG) was also used for comparison. The pesticides tested re those used in olive crops, as terbuthylazine, tebuconazole and MCPA (Hermosin et a l., 2013). The clays were granulated to pellets with carnauba wax (car) as binder through a <b>ram</b> <b>extruder.</b> Powder clay and car were mixed (30 % wt car) at 90 ºC. Anthracite (Antra 170, AstralPool) was mixed at rate of 40 % with the clay pellets as filtering bed in the tank with artificially contaminated water, Antracite helps to avoid clay swelling and to increase the bed porosity and improve the conditions of the water flow. Experiment set-up has a minimum flow of 30 ml/min to obtain pressures of 1 bar. The adsorption tests were carried out using a solution containing the three pesticides at initial concentration of 1 ppm in 40 liters of water. The adsorption kinetics was measured at selected times (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 24 h). This work reveals that the pelletization process did not affect significantly the pesticide sorption capacity of clays (37 - 96 %) and the pellets were not altered in terms of size showing an excellent water resistance {{at the end of the}} experiment. We obtained a high adsorption of the three pesticides tested for the cases of the commercial clay (Clo 10) and for CTI-HDTMA, removing from 40 - 100 % of pesticide from water after 24 h of treatment in the filter system. In contrast, the CTI-Fe sample did not perform as a good adsorbent, removing only between 15 - 42 % of the herbicides from water after 24 h of treatment in the filter. CTI-HDTMA reveals as a very promising adsorbent derived from a low cost material to be used in filter systems for removing pesticides from contaminated waters. Hence the development of a small company devoted to the processing of low value clay sample would have to be considered. Beall, G. W. (2003) : The use of organo-clays in water treatment. Appl.
