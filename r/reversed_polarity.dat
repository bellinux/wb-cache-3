When these magnetic patterns were mapped over a wide region, the ocean floor showed a zebra-like pattern: one stripe with normal polarity and the adjoining stripe with <b>reversed</b> <b>polarity.</b> The overall pattern, defined by these alternating bands of normally and reversely polarized rock, became known as magnetic striping, and was published by Ron G. Mason and co-workers in 1961, who did not find, though, an explanation for these data in terms of sea floor spreading, like Vine, Matthews and Morley a few years later.|$|E

Experiments were made at the arc current range from 20 to 60 A for straight polarity jet and 10 to 30 A for <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet in Argon gas flow rate from 15 to 40 l/min. The results of this experimental investigation were as follws : The arc voltage versus arc current characteristics for straight polarity jet were drooping characteristics, untill the arc current was 40 A, but for over 40 A, it was positive characteristics. On the other hand, for <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet, it was always drooping one. As the gas flow rate increased, the arc voltage of both jets was increased. The arc voltage of <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet was higher than straight polarity jet. For straight polarity jet, the ratio of the sum of the cross electrode loss and the nozzle loss to the total loss was rang from 70 to 80 %, and the ratio of the cross electrode loss to the former was rang from 70 to 84 %. But for <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet, the cross electrode loss was down fifth value of straight polarity jet. The thermal efficiency of this generator was rang from 65 to 85 % as the general plasma jet generator, and increasing the gas flow rate, it was increase. The mean temperature was below 3015 °K. The arc mode of straight polarity jet was indicated the quasisteady mode or steady mode, but for <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet, it was always indicated the oscillation mode. At the same power input, the plasme flame length of <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet was longer than that of straight polarity jet and so the form of <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet was more sharp.

2500|$|Silane is {{the silicon}} {{analogue}} of methane. Because {{of the greater}} electronegativity of hydrogen in comparison to silicon, this Si–H bond polarity {{is the opposite of}} that in the C–H bonds of methane. One consequence of this <b>reversed</b> <b>polarity</b> is the greater tendency of silane to form complexes with transition metals. [...] A second consequence is that silane is pyrophoric— it undergoes spontaneous combustion in air, without the need for external ignition. However, the difficulties in explaining the available (often contradictory) combustion data are ascribed to the fact that silane itself is stable and that the natural formation of larger silanes during production, as well as the sensitivity of combustion to impurities such as moisture and to the catalytic effects of container surfaces causes its pyrophoricity. Above 420°C, silane decomposes into silicon and hydrogen; it can therefore be used in the chemical vapor deposition of silicon.|$|E
