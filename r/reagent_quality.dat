40|$|Consistent {{performance}} of anti-drug antibody (ADA) assays through {{all stages of}} clinical development is critical {{for the assessment of}} immunogenicity and interpretation of PK, PD, safety, and efficacy. The electrochemiluminescent assays commonly employed for ADA measurement use drug conjugated with ruthenium and biotin to bind ADA in samples. Here we report an association between high nonspecific ADA responses in certain drug-naïve individuals and the storage buffer of the conjugated reagents used in a monoclonal antibody ADA assay. Ruthenylated reagents stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer had increased levels of aggregate and produced variable and high baseline responses in some subjects. Reagents stored in a histidine-sucrose buffer (HSB) had lower aggregate levels and produced low sample responses. In contrast to PBS, conjugated reagents formulated in HSB remained low in aggregate content and in sample response variability after 5 freeze/thaw cycles.

The methods used for comparison included two radioimmunoassays, one with enzyme labelling, two with fluorescence enhanced enzyme reactions and 3 luminescence immunoassays. In most cases, the precision of the ES 300 lay between 2 and 5 % in all assays in the concentration ranges of clinical interest.

40|$|Purpose – The paper’s {{aim is to}} {{show the}} {{development}} of materials and methods which allow freeform fabrication of macroscopic Zn-air electrochemical batteries. Freedom of geometric design may allow for new possibilities in performance optimization. Design/methodology/approach – The authors have formulated battery materials which are compatible with solid freeform fabrication (SFF) while retaining electrochemical functionality. Using SFF processes, they have fabricated six Zn-air cylindrical batteries and quantitatively characterized them and comparable commercial batteries. They analyze their performance in light of models from the literature and they also present SFF of a flexible twocell battery of unusual geometry. Findings – Under continuous discharge to 0. 25 V/cell with a 100 V load, the cylindrical cells have a specific energy and power density {{in the range of}} 40 - 70 J/g and 0. 4 - 1 mW/cm 2, respectively, with a mass range of 8 - 18 g. The commercial Zn-air button cells tested produce 30 - 750 J/g and 7 - 9 mW/cm 2 under the same conditions, and have a mass range of 0. 2 - 2 g. The two-cell, flexible Zn-air battery produces a nominal 2. 8 V, open-circuit. Research limitations/implications – The freeform-fabricated batteries have, 10 percent of the normalized performance of the commercial batteries. High-internal contact resistance, loss of electrolyte through evaporation, and inferior catalyst <b>reagent</b> <b>quality</b> are possible causes of inferior performance. Complicated material preparation and battery fabrication processes have limited the number of batteries fabricated and characterized, limiting the statistical significance of the results. Practical implications – Performance enhancement will be necessary before the packaging efficiency and design freedom provided by freeformfabricate...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDynamic range {{limitations}} are challenging to proteomics, particularly in clinical samples. Affinity proteomics partially overcomes this, yet suffers from dependence on <b>reagent</b> <b>quality.</b> SOMAscan, an aptamer-based platform for over 1000 proteins, avoids that issue using nucleic acid binders. Targets include low expressed proteins not easily accessible by other approaches. Here {{we report on}} the potential of SOMAscan for the study of differently sourced mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in comparison to LC-MS/MS and RNA sequencing. While targeting fewer analytes, SOMAscan displays high precision and dynamic range coverage, allowing quantification of proteins not measured by the other platforms. Expression between cell types (ESC and MSC) was compared across techniques and uncovered the expected large differences. Sourcing was investigated by comparing subtypes: bone marrow-derived, standard in clinical studies, and ESC-derived MSC, thought to hold similar potential but devoid of inter-donor variability and proliferating faster in vitro. We confirmed subtype-equivalency, as well as vesicle and extracellular matrix related processes in MSC. In contrast, the proliferative nature of ESC was captured less by SOMAscan, where nuclear proteins are underrepresented. The complementary of SOMAscan allowed the comprehensive exploration of CD markers and signaling molecules, not readily accessible otherwise and offering unprecedented potential in subtype characterization. SignificanceMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) represent promising stem cell-derived therapeutics as indicated by their application in > 500 clinical trials currently registered with the NIH. Tissue-derived MSC require invasive harvesting and imply donor-to-donor differences, to which embryonic stem cell (ESC) -derived MSC may provide an alternative and thus warrant thorough characterization. In continuation of our previous study where we compared in depth embryonic stem cells (ESC) and MSC from two sources (bone marrow and ESC-derived), we included the aptamer-based SOMAscan assay, complementing LC-MS/MS and RNA-seq data.

40|$|This thesis focusses on the {{selection}} and characterisation of DNA aptamers and the various aspects related to their selection from large pools of randomized oligonucleotides. Aptamers are affinity tools that can specifically recognize and bind predefined target molecules; this ability, however, is not exclusively associated with aptamers. Antibodies are the most successful affinity tools used today, but alternative affinity tools such as aptamers, engineered binding proteins and molecular imprinted polymers are emerging as sound alternatives. A comparison of their properties is described in Chapter 1. The strength and specificity {{of the interaction between}} an affinity tool and its target molecule is an important feature. Generally, an affinity tool should have a high affinity for its target and should be highly specific in order to be useful for research or commercial purposes. One highly advanced method to characterise the interaction between an affinity tool and its target molecule makes use of a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) -based biosensor. Although SPR is an optical phenomenon, in depth knowledge of the physics behind this phenomenon is not required to operate an SPR-based biosensor. Experiments should be performed in a correct way, and therefore {{it is important to understand}} how experimental parameters, such as flow rate, ligand density, surface preparation, and <b>reagent</b> <b>quality</b> either improve or adversely affect data quality. Experimental considerations, as well as methods for proper data analysis are discussed in Chapter 2. Data generated within the framework of the 2011 Global Label-free Interaction Benchmark study serves as a typical example. The ability of aptamers to bind a specific target originates from an intricate interplay between the oligonucleotide sequence and the three dimensional structure that this sequence allows to form. In Chapter 3 this is illustrated by {{the selection}} and characterisation of streptavidin-binding aptamers. Five aptamer families were identified, sharing a similar secondary structure. Although slight variations at the actual sequence level are present, two guanines are completely conserved. Using site-specific mutagenesis it was demonstrated that these guanines are essential for streptavidin binding. Binding kinetics and the dissociation constant of each aptamer was determined by SPR and were all within the range of 35 - 375 nM. Two aptamers can bind one streptavidin tetramer at the same time, as was shown by native mass spectrometry analysis. In addition, the three dimensional structure of the most abundant aptamer was modelled and manually docked to the streptavidin structure, in order to gain more insight in the molecular basis of the interaction. To extend this knowledge even further, crystallisation trails, aiming to obtain a co-crystal structure for the streptavidin-aptamer complex, were performed, and are described in Chapter 4. Unfortunately, these trials did only yield protein crystals, instead of the desired streptavidin-aptamer complex. Therefore, alternative experimental and computational approaches were investigated that could be used to study aptamer-protein interactions. Combining techniques as SPR, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and Dynamic light scattering (DLS) could be considered as an alternative to X-ray crystallography. In addition, some of these techniques may provide information on the dynamics of complex formation, whereas crystallography gives a time- and position-averaged image. Besides streptavidin, another protein, SpaC, was subjected to aptamer selection in this thesis. SpaC is a subunit of pili present on the probiotic Gram-positive bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and contains a binding domain for human-mucus. Presence of this binding domain is considered an advantage, because it is already designed to interact with other molecules. Successful production and purification of recombinant SpaC protein is described in Chapter 5, as well as the characterisation of DNA oligonucleotides enriched during subsequent selection rounds. Sequence analysis revealed that specific oligonucleotides are indeed enriched. Furthermore, results of pilot SPR experiments indicated that they bind specifically to SpaC, but more detailed experiments are required to unambiguously demonstrate this. The dynamics of aptamer enrichment are poorly understood. To address this issue and to gain a more fundamental insight in the aptamer selection process, a multiplexed high throughput sequencing effort was started, which is described in Chapter 6. In this approach samples of 70 selection rounds, derived from 8 distinct aptamer selection experiments, were barcoded, pooled together and sequenced; over 84 million paired-end reads were obtained and analysed. Samples enriched to bind streptavidin show a decrease in α-diversity across subsequent selection rounds. Interestingly, large differences were found between the composition of fractions enriched by affinity elution and thermal elution. Moreover,  a small scale comparison of two clone libraries showed that affinity elution, which is expected to enrich more specific binders, also specifically enriches rapid binders. Supportive SPR experiments have made an important contribution throughout this thesis. The main focus in Chapter 7, however, is on a new application of SPR. The development of a capture approach for supercoiled plasmid DNA, using a triple helix forming oligonucleotide, is described. It could be demonstrated that plasmid DNA can indeed be captured and that SPR can subsequently be used to derive kinetic parameters of a specific interaction with a plasmid. In this particular case the interaction between Lac repressor and its plasmid-based operator was characterised, showing that the association and dissociation rates are ~ 18 times lower, but that the affinity is the same, when compared to binding to linear operator DNA. This difference underscores the importance of using a DNA substrate with a physiologically relevant topology for studying DNA-protein interactions...|$|E

40|$|A {{selective}} synergistic {{extraction process}} for recovering vanadium (V) from the high-acidity chloride leaching liquor was proposed. Vanadium (V) extraction from the simulated high-acidity leaching liquor with numerous impurities using a mixed extractant consisting of tricaprylmethylammonium chloride (Aliquat 336) and tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) was studied while obvious synergism was found. According to synergistic enhancement coefficient and physical property of organic phase, the suitable extractant composition was the volume ratio of Aliquat 336 to TBP 1 : 4. The vanadium (V) extraction increased sharply as HCL concentration increased from 1. 01 mol/L to 4. 13 mol/L. Under the optimum extraction conditions (extractant concentration of 50 vol%, 1 min, 25 - 30 degrees C, and phase ratio (O/A) of 1 : 1), the vanadium extraction with three stages was above 90. 0 %. Almost no other impurity ions, such as Ca, Al, Mg, Cr, Ti, Mn, and Si, were co-extracted.

A consultation meeting was organised to discuss issues regarding the standardization and evaluation of BCG vaccines in the forum of regulators, BCG vaccine manufacturers, developers of selected new live tuberculosis (TB) vaccines and researchers. The development of new recombinant BCG and live attenuated TB vaccines and the characterization of different BCG sub-strains using state-of-the-art technologies were also reviewed. The objective of the meeting was to revise and update the current recommendations focused on the scope, terminology, manufacturing issues, and the incorporation of new reference <b>reagents</b> and new <b>quality</b> control tests. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} a set {{of commercial}} Salmonella somatic and flagellar serotyping antisera to in-house-prepared antisera from the Microbial Diseases Laboratory, California Department of Public Health, using 327 Salmonella enterica strains belonging to subgroups I, II, IIIa, IIIb, and IV. The sensitivities of Denka Seiken (Tokyo, Japan) somatic and flagellar antisera (using a tube agglutination assay) were 94. 0 % and 99. 2 %, respectively, and the specificity was 100 % for both sets of sera. Polyvalent O and O 1 antiserum sensitivity and specificity were > 90 %, {{with the exception of}} polyvalent O 1 antiserum, for which sensitivity was 88. 9 %. When Denka Seiken flagellar antisera were used in a slide agglutination assay, the sensitivity and accuracy dropped to 88. 9 % and the specificity fell to 91 %. Overall, Denka Seiken commercial antisera performed very well and, together with the comprehensive range of factors available, offer laboratories <b>quality</b> <b>reagents</b> suitable for serotyping strains of salmonellae...|$|R

The obtained precipitates were dried by an infrared lamp and dry samples were fired at 300 °C for 12  hours, 600 °C for 12  hours, 800 °C for 1  hour and 1000 °C for 1  hour.|$|R
40|$|In this study, Chinese gallotannins were {{characterized}} by MALDI-TOF MS, and effects of cationization <b>reagents</b> on the <b>quality</b> of spectra were investigated. The trideca- and tetradeca-galloyl glucoses were observed in Chinese gallotannins, {{which could not be}} detected in earlier studies. When Cs+ was used as the cationization reagent, Chinese gallotannins gave a relatively simple MALDI-TOF spectrum, three series of quasimolecular ions [M + Cs](+), [M + 2 Cs-H](+), and [M + 3 Cs- 2 H](+) and a series of metastable ion peaks with minimum abundance were detected. Selection of Na+ as the cationization reagent, additional three series of ion peaks including two patterns from the fragmentation and complex 2 M adducts [2 M + Na](+) can be distinguished. In the case of no deionization or addition of cationization reagent to the analyte/ matrix, naturally abundant Na+ and K+ as the cationization reagent, [M + Na](+) and [M + K](+) molecular ions both appeared in the complicated spectrum. Therefore, we conclude that cationization reagents affect the MALDI-TOF MS spectrum of Chinese gallotannins significantly. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, fnc...|$|R
