With {{the advent of}} the Output Delivery System (ODS) you have almost total control over how the output from those procedures looks. But, there are still times where you need (or want) just a little more and that’s where the Report Writing Interface (RWI) can help. The Report Writing Interface is just a fancy way of saying you’re using the ODSOUT object in a data step. This object allows you to layout the page, create tables, embed images, add titles and footnotes and more – all from within a data step, using whatever data step logic you need. Also, all the style capabilities of ODS are available to you so that your data step created output can have fonts, sizes, colors, backgrounds and borders to make your report look just like you want. This presentation will quickly cover some of the basics of using the ODSOUT object and then walk through some of the techniques to create four “real world ” examples.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{contribution}} is to gain insights into how Italian listed companies define their investor relations (IR) communication strategies. The analysis {{is based on the}} FTSE MIB benchmark index, i. e., the forty most highly-traded companies on the Borsa Italiana (Milan Stock Exchange). As an initial step, the website of each company was perused to (1) identify the overall nature of IR communication practices and (2) collect textual data indicative of IR communication strategies. In line with an established trend among major companies worldwide (Deller et al. 1999), all the FTSE MIB companies present well-articulated webpages dedicated to IR, containing various types of financial performance documentation in English, both mandatory (e. g., annual reports) and voluntary (e. g., conference call presentations in pdf form). In contrast, specific information about IR communication policy, guidelines and underlying principles is often less accessible, in many cases embedded sporadically and inconsistently in other website texts (e. g., corporate governance <b>report,</b> <b>code</b> of ethics, guide for investors), thus pointing to the lack of a well-defined disclosure policy genre in the Italian context. The policy-related textual data identified on the websites was then compiled into the Italian subcorpus of the IRCS for micro-linguistic analysis using various types of corpus tools (e. g., part-of-speech and semantic tagging). Preliminary findings indicate the presence of linguistic features linked to the principles of transparency and trust. However, to optimize this message, companies should provide clearly accessible information about IR communication policy on their websites, {{especially in light of the}} importance that stakeholders attribute to clear and consistent disclosure practices...|$|E

40|$|To get {{the right}} {{competence}} {{at the right time}} can often be crucial for a company. This competence can be of different types, e. g. data from a system or human knowledge related to a specific problem. The idea with CODE (Competence On DEmand) is to support the process industry by finding models and system which through new technology (like augmented and virtual reality) can facilitate the recruitment and supply of specialists, bridge generation gap and increase quality assurance in the transfer of knowledge between employees – to make sure the right competence is available when it is needed. This project has examined two companies with different prerequisites to see if modern technology could help them with their competence needs. ABB FACTS runs operations {{in many parts of the}} world and it can be complicated to coordinate maintenance actions for all the different sites. Instead of sending specialists to support the different operations (which cost money and is very time inefficient) could it be possible to use some kind of remote guidance solution instead? For Gyproc, a big plaster manufacturer, quality insurance is of the essence and it is crucial that different persons interpret information in the same way. Could augmented reality be used to make it easier for the operators to access information and could virtual reality be used to better prepare the operators before their shift begin? The results of this study show that a remote guidance system using augmented reality could really facilitate the process of helping a technician working remotely. It is also possible to construct a virtual environment where operators could learn how to perform difficult tasks and procedures in a safe way. In this project the main question was “is it possible to use modern technology to solve the problems these companies have”? The answer was yes so now the next step is a new project where the findings in CODE are used to create a prototype of a system that solves these problems.

40|$|The {{possibility}} to use real-time computer vision in video sequences gives {{many opportunities for}} a system {{to interact with the}} environment. Possible ways for interaction are e. g. augmented reality like in the MATRIS project where the purpose is to add new objects into the video sequence, or surveillance where the purpose is to find abnormal events. The increase of the speed of computers the last years has simplified this process and it is now possible to use {{at least some of the}} more advanced computer vision algorithms that are available. The computational speed of computers is however still a problem, for an efficient real-time system efficient code and methods are necessary. This thesis deals with both problems, one part is about efficient implementations using single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions and one part is about robust tracking. An efficient real-time system requires efficient implementations of the used computer vision methods. Efficient implementations requires knowledge about the CPU and the possibilities given. In this thesis, one method called SIMD is explained. SIMD is useful when the same operation is applied to multiple data which usually is the case in computer vision, the same operation is executed on each pixel. Following the position of a feature or object in a video sequence is called tracking. Tracking can be used for a number of applications. The application in this thesis is to use tracking for pose estimation. One way to do tracking is to cut out a small region around the feature, creating a patch and find the position on this patch in the other frames. To find the position, a measure of the difference between the patch and the image in a given position is used. This thesis thoroughly investigates the sum of absolute difference (SAD) error measure. The investigation involves different ways to improve the robustness and to decrease the average error. One method to estimate the average error, the covariance of the position error is proposed. An estimate of the average error is needed when different measurements are combined. Finally, a system for camera pose estimation is presented. The computer vision part of this system is based on the result in this thesis. This presentation contains also a discussion about the result of this system. Report code: LIU-TEK-LIC- 2007 : 5.

40|$|Background On July 1 st 2013 the Mandatory <b>Reporting</b> <b>Code</b> Act {{came into}} {{force in the}} Netherlands, making it {{compulsory}} for health professionals to adhere to a <b>reporting</b> <b>code</b> when they suspect patients to be {{victims of domestic violence}} (DV) or child abuse (CA). The Royal Dutch Dental Association (KNMT) developed a <b>reporting</b> <b>code</b> for dental professionals (RCD). Moreover, an e-learning module about DV has been developed. A web-survey was conducted to investigate how general dental practitioners (GDPs) deal with the RCD and what their experiences are with (signs of) DV and CA. Methods In April 2014 1038 GDPs were invited by e-mail to participate in a web-survey consisting of 24 items, through the KNMT Data Stations Project. The data was analyzed using SPSS (RELIABILITY, CHISQ and ANOVA). Results Of all GDPs invited to participate 264 (25 %) responded. 82 % of these GDPs are aware of their obligation to use the <b>reporting</b> <b>code.</b> 54 % of the GDPs are in favor of this obligation. 76 % of the GDPs have taken notice of the KNMT’s RCD and 51 % of the GDPs have implemented the <b>reporting</b> <b>code</b> {{in one form or another}} in their practice. 24 % of the GDPs stated having suspected DV during the last twelve months in the case of 2. 4 patients on average. 81 % took note of this in the patient’s record and 58 % also took action in different ways. 54 % wants to complete the e-learning module. Conclusions Most GDPs are aware of the new legislation and have taken cognizance of the RCD. Even though the majority of GDPs are not opposed to using a <b>reporting</b> <b>code,</b> over half of them have not yet implemented the code in practice. An important factor in this regard seems to be that a substantial minority of the GDPs says they are not sufficiently informed about aspects of reporting a case and about the steps they have to take...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Child {{abuse is}} often unrecognized at out-of-hours primary care (OOH-PC) services. The aim {{of our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical outcome of the screening instrument SPUTOVAMO-R 2 for child abuse (checklist), followed by a structured approach (<b>reporting</b> <b>code),</b> at OOH-PC services. The <b>reporting</b> <b>code</b> with five steps should ensure consistent action {{in case of a}} suspicion. METHODS: All children attending one of the five participating OOH-PC services in the region of Utrecht, the Netherlands, in a year time, were included. The checklist is an obligatory field in the electronic patient file and was filled in for all children. In case of a positive checklist, the steps in the <b>reporting</b> <b>code</b> were followed. Additionally, the case was evaluated in a multidisciplinary team to determine the probability of child abuse. RESULTS: The checklist was filled in for 50671 children; 108 (0. 2  %) were positive. The multidisciplinary team diagnosed child abuse in 24 (22  %) of the 108 positive checklists, and no child abuse in 36 (33  %). Emotional neglect was the most frequent type of abuse diagnosed. For all abused children, care was implemented according to the protocol. The most frequent care given was a referral to the hospital (N[*]=[*] 7) or contact with child's own general practitioner (N[*]=[*] 6). CONCLUSION: A checklist followed by a <b>reporting</b> <b>code</b> guarantees consistent actions and care for children with a suspicion of child abuse.
