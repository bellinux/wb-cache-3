5|$|As the {{civilian}} population started to return in late September, Gospić chief of police Ivan Dasović proposed that {{a list of the}} <b>returning</b> Serbs should be drawn up, ostensibly for security purposes. According to Ante Karić, President of the Lika Crisis Headquarters (krizni stožer), Dasović feared that the <b>returning</b> Serbs might harbour a fifth column, undermining defence of the town. Karić reportedly opposed the move, but the list was compiled on 10 October. A similar list of Serbs <b>returning</b> to nearby Karlobag was prepared on 16 October.|$|E

5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and <b>returning</b> echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return.

5|$|After {{the poll}} closes, the {{presiding}} officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them.

After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the <b>returning</b> officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes.
