5|$|After this intersection, Old Baltimore Pike {{continues}} past suburban neighborhoods, {{gaining a}} center left-turn lane and intersecting Salem Church Road. Farther east, the highway <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> junction with DE 273 in a wooded area. At this point, the road narrows to two lanes again and {{heads into the}} community of Christiana. Here, the highway intersects DE 7, where it turns north and follows that route through residential areas. The road comes to an interchange with DE 1 {{to the west of}} the Christiana Mall, where DE 7 continues north along with DE 1 and Old Baltimore Pike <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> dead end.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{question}} of how long it takes players to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> Nash equilibrium in uncoupled setups, where each player initially knows only his own payoff function. We derive lower bounds on the communication complexity of <b>reaching</b> <b>a</b> Nash equilibrium, i. e., on the number of bits that need to be transmitted, and thus also on the required number of steps. Specifically, we show lower bounds that are exponential in the number of players in each one of the following cases: (1) <b>reaching</b> <b>a</b> pure Nash equilibrium; (2) <b>reaching</b> <b>a</b> pure Nash equilibrium in a Bayesian setting; and (3) <b>reaching</b> <b>a</b> mixed Nash equilibrium. We then show that, in contrast, the communication complexity of <b>reaching</b> <b>a</b> correlated equilibrium is polynomial in the number of players.

5|$|The {{plutonium}} {{present in}} {{spent nuclear fuel}} contains about 12% of 241Pu. Because it spontaneously converts to 241Am, 241Pu can be extracted and {{may be used to}} generate further 241Am. However, this process is rather slow: half of the original amount of 241Pu decays to 241Am after about 15 years, and the 241Am amount <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> maximum after 70 years.|$|E
5|$|When the allele {{frequency}} is very small, drift can also overpower selection even in large populations. For example, while disadvantageous mutations are usually eliminated quickly in large populations, new advantageous mutations {{are almost as}} vulnerable to loss through genetic drift as are neutral mutations. Not until the {{allele frequency}} for the advantageous mutation <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> certain threshold will genetic drift have no effect.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} {{a portion of}} the mountain, the player <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> basecamp intermezzo with multiple opportunities for collecting new abilities. The player can trade minerals for abilities in the store, and choose between two abilities to receive for free. The basecamp also contains minigames, such as a shooting range, a gambling device, and optional sidequests, which reward the player with shortcuts to later stages in subsequent playthroughs for completing challenges such as finishing a level within a time limit or without receiving damage.|$|E
5|$|Air is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of three characters. Much of its {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Air follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. With the consumer ports, if an undesired choice was selected, {{there would be an}} option to rewind the story to correct the mistake. However, if the player <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> bad end to a storyline, the player does not have this option and must reload the game at the last saved point.|$|E
5|$|Effective in the 2014 racing season, the {{grandstand}} capacity was reduced from 92,000 to 68,000. This {{was accomplished by}} removing approximately 12,000 seats near Turn 1 and installing a hospitality area and a digital display showing speeds along the straightaway. In addition, seats were further reduced {{as a result of}} modifying average seat width from 18 inches to 23 inches. The capacity quoted does not include luxury boxes and infield seating, which when added up <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> capacity of approximately 100,000.|$|E

Redwood Road turns east onto 500 South and enters Bountiful. Past an interchange at I-15, the route gains one passing lane and turns south onto 200 West, a two-lane undivided road. The highway turns southwest and defaults onto southbound US-89 {{within the city}} of Woods Cross.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II and {{the large}} {{adjustment}} as the economy adjusted from wartime to peacetime in 1945, the collection of many economic indicators, such as unemployment and GDP, became standardized. Recessions after World War II may be compared to each other much more easily than previous recessions because of these available data. The listed dates and durations are from the official chronology of the National Bureau of Economic Research. GDP data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, unemployment from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (after 1948). Note that the unemployment rate often <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> peak associated with a recession after the recession has officially ended.|$|E

5|$|Impala feed on {{soft and}} nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the presence of a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E

Jack shoots Barbossa, and Will drops both coins into the chest, with his and Jack's blood on them. The curse is lifted, causing Barbossa to die from Jack's gunshot; the rest of Barbossa's crew, realizing that they are no longer immortal, surrender and are arrested.|$|E
