500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the Chinese scholar Liu Fenglu ( [...] ; 17761829) {{initiated}} a long, drawn-out controversy when he proposed, by emphasizing certain discrepancies {{between it and}} the Annals, that the Zuo zhuan was not originally a commentary on the Annals. Liu's theory was taken much further by the prominent scholar and reformer Kang Youwei, who argued that Liu Xin did not <b>really</b> <b>find</b> the [...] "ancient script" [...] version of the Zuo zhuan in the imperial archives, as historical records describe, but actually forged it as a commentary on the Annals. [...] Kang's theory was that Liu Xinwho with his father Liu Xiang, the imperial librarian, {{was one of the first}} to have access to the rare documents in the Han dynasty's imperial archivestook the Discourses of the States (Guoyu 國語) and forged it into a chronicle-like work to fit the format of the Annals in an attempt to lend credibility to the policies of his master, the usurper Wang Mang.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker {{called the}} episode [...] "at once cool-looking, heart-tugging, and pretty simple", {{especially}} {{when compared to}} previous episodes like [...] "White Tulip". Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded the episode with an A, explaining [...] "I can't <b>really</b> <b>find</b> anything to complain about here. The direction was effectively moody and snappy, the performances were sharp, and the case was cool." [...] Murray praised the subtle characteristics of the parallel universe, the action scenes, {{and the use of}} split-screens to visually show Milo's predictions. MTV's Josh Wigler believed that the episode [...] "demonstrated how the mystery-of-the-week format can still be compelling: by taking everything familiar and applying a stark new layer of paint." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "The third season of Fringe continues to get better with each episode. Most importantly, it has momentum. It's moving forward with a distinct destination, and even though I know Fringe is heading somewhere, I have no idea where that might be, or what's going to happen when we get there. Boy, if you're not watching Fringe, you're missing out." ...|$|E

Had ancestor-worship been a péché mignon of Israel, the Prophets would have let Israel hear their mind on it.|$|R

500|$|The three DVD volumes {{released}} by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania.com. In {{the review of}} the first DVD, the reviewer Chris Beveridge described the anime as [...] "something different from the norm" [...] which [...] "mixes romance and comedy quite well". However, the pacing early on is felt as being [...] "awkward" [...] which [...] "takes time to <b>really</b> <b>find</b> its rhythm". For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that [...] "the mixing of the relationships continues to be the most interesting part of the show." [...] Beveridge goes on to state [...] "the mild moments of it are tacky and bad," [...] but [...] "when it comes to the core cast of characters, it's all solid material that is very enjoyable." [...] Finally, for the third volume, Beveridge wrote that [...] "despite the issues with how the series turns in the bonus OVA episode, Kashimashi has proven to be quite a lot of fun for the situations it presented." [...] The series is seen to [...] "close out rather well," [...] and [...] "not only is it good fun but it's also an enjoyable romantic show with lots of heart and emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|Strong {{states that}} [...] "...sections {{of what was}} [...] {{hardcore}} became known as grunge." [...] Seattle songwriter Jeff Stetson states that [...] "here is no real difference...between Punk and Grunge." [...] Like punk bands, grunge groups were [...] "embraced as back-to-basics rock ‘n’ roll bands which reminded the public that the music {{was supposed to be}} raw and raunchy", and they were a response to [...] "bloated and over-the-top...progressive rock...or [...] "not seriou like the hair bands of the ‘80s." [...] One example of the influence of US hardcore on grunge is the impact that the Los Angeles hardcore punk band Black Flag had on grunge. Black Flag's 1984 record My War, on which the band combined heavy metal with their traditional sound, made a strong impact in Seattle. Mudhoney's Steve Turner commented, [...] "A lot of other people around the country hated the fact that Black Flag slowed down...but up here it was really great...we were like 'Yay!' They were weird and fucked-up sounding." [...] Turner explained grunge's integration of metal influences, noting, [...] "Hard rock and metal was never that much of an enemy of punk like it was for other scenes. Here, it was like, 'There's only twenty people here, you can't <b>really</b> <b>find</b> a group to hate.'" [...] Bands began to mix metal and punk in the Seattle music scene around 1984, with much of the credit for this fusion going to The U-Men.|$|E

Nicholas doesn't have all the answers to what he's trying to do.

2500|$|In 1969, Luciani was {{cautious}} of {{de facto}} relationships as a lesser evil to divorce. He said that unions like those shouldn't {{be the same}} as marriage but he added that [...] "there are, in undeniably pathological family situations, painful cases. To remedy that, some propose a divorce, which, conversely, would aggravate this. But some remedy outside of divorce, you can't <b>really</b> <b>find?</b> Once the legitimate family is protected and made a place of honor, you {{will not be able to}} recognize with all appropriate precautions some civil effect to de facto unions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Glenn Kenny, in {{his review}} for Premiere criticized the film's style, [...] "Kelly's camera {{placement}} and framing are at best textbook and at worst calamitously mediocre." [...] In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano wrote, [...] "You {{get the sense that}} Kelly is too angry to <b>really</b> <b>find</b> any of it funny. It's easy to empathize with his position, not so easy to remain engrossed in a film that's occasionally inspired but ultimately manic and scattered." [...] David Edelstein's review in New York magazine criticized the film's writing, [...] "Kelly aims high and must have shot off his own ear, which {{is the only way to}} account for the dialogue." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1999, an {{unsigned}} {{article that}} media outlets attributed to Falwell {{was published in}} the National Liberty Journal– a promotional publication of the university he founded– claimed that the purple Teletubby named Tinky Winky was intended as a gay role model. An article published in 1998 by Salon.com had noted Tinky Winky's status as a gay icon. In response, Steve Rice, spokesperson for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment, which licenses the Teletubbies in the United States, said, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>find</b> it absurd and kind of offensive." [...] The immensely popular UK show was aimed at pre-school children, but the article stated [...] "he is purple– the gay pride color; and his antenna is shaped like a triangle– the gay-pride symbol". Apart from those characteristics Tinky Winky also carries a magic bag which the NLJ and Salon articles said was a purse. Falwell added that [...] "role modeling the gay lifestyle is damaging to the moral lives of children".|$|E

2500|$|During the storyline with Silas, viewers {{were able}} to see a {{stronger}} and more determined side to the character. A writer for E4's official Hollyoaks website said viewers should not let the character's [...] "delicate exterior" [...] fool them, as beneath it she had [...] "the heart and courage of a lion". They explained that Lynsey was required to prove she had a backbone during several crisis situations, in which she demonstrated her [...] "superhero antics". But that her real test of character came after she was attacked by Silas. They added that the attack marked the beginning of a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse that led to Lynsey losing her friends, job, home and nearly her sanity. Various media sources described Lynsey as flirty, determined, brave, plucky, gorgeous and a beauty. After her exit, Hassan said she would like Lynsey to be remembered as a [...] "serial killer hunter extraordinaire", the girl next door with a big heart, Cheryl's best friend and [...] "the girl who could never <b>really</b> <b>find</b> the man of her dreams!" ...|$|E

30|$|The {{heuristic}} {{part of our}} {{method is}} that {{we assume that the}} block Arnoldi method <b>really</b> <b>finds</b> all eigenvalues in a circle around the shift σ. While quite often the eigenvalues do indeed appear and converge in the order of the distance to the shift, it is not rare that one or a group of eigenvalues converge slower than other farer away eigenvalues. However, in these cases usually the missed eigenvalues are present as (yet) unconverged Ritz values. Therefore, we use the unconverged Ritz value that is closest to the shift as the radius of a circle that is trusted to contain no missed eigenvalues.|$|R

5000|$|While Adventism is a {{child of}} the 16th century Reformation {{initiated}} by Martin Luther, John Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli, its theological orientation <b>really</b> <b>finds</b> itself at home with the Radical Reformation or the Anabaptists. Anabaptists went back to the original early church teachings and rejected infant baptism and state support of the church. They called for a believer's church where baptism followed faith, and stood for a separation of church and state. Anabaptists viewed the Major Reformation churches as not being consistent in the belief of Sola Scriptura. They sought to get back towards New Testament church ideals, rather than stick to where Luther, Calvin or Zwingli did theologically, moving away from church traditions and creedal formulas. Anabaptism influence permeated the evangelical denominations of the 19th century.|$|R
