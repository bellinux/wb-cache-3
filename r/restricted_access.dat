5|$|In August 2010, Russian {{authorities}} arrested nine individuals {{connected to}} a ransomware Trojan known as WinLock. Unlike the previous Gpcode Trojan, WinLock did not use encryption. Instead, WinLock trivially <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> to the system by displaying pornographic images, and asked users to send a premium-rate SMS (costing around US$10) to receive a code {{that could be used}} to unlock their machines. The scam hit numerous users across Russia and neighboring countries—reportedly earning the group over US$16 million.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{long period}} of decline, the house was {{purchased}} in the 1980s by a group of local residents and restored as part of its conversion to offices. It became a focal point for Ickenham during the biennial Ickenham Festival when the grounds were used to host the main gala day, until the house's new owners <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> in 2014. Swakeleys is open in part once a year to the public as part of Open House London. Planning permission was granted in 2014 for the conversion of the house to form one large, residential property.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, the Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseinni ordered an opening be made at the {{southern}} end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall. The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall. Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> to the Wall, resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained indifferent.|$|E
5|$|The club {{succeeded in}} a further legal {{challenge}} bought by small firms in January 2005 as the High Court upheld {{a decision by}} then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to grant a compulsory purchase order {{in support of the}} scheme. The stadium later became issue in the local elections in May 2006. The Metropolitan Police restricted supporters' coaches to being parked in the nearby Sobel Sports Centre rather than in the underground stadium car park, and <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> to 14 streets on match days. These police restrictions were conditions of the stadiums' health and safety certificate which the stadium requires to operate and open. The road closures were passed at a council meeting in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Nimitz {{recommended}} to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that development {{and control of}} the base facilities be placed under SOPAC by extending its border westward to include the Admiralties. MacArthur was furious; the borders of SWPA could not be changed without the consent of the Australian government. Nimitz's proposal was eventually turned down by the Joint Chiefs but not before MacArthur <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> to the facilities to ships of the United States Seventh Fleet and British Pacific Fleet. Halsey was summoned to MacArthur's headquarters in Brisbane on 3March 1944, and the two agreed to a compromise. Responsibility {{for the development of the}} base passed from Krueger's Alamo Force to Kinkaid's Allied Naval Forces on 18May 1944. It was proposed control would ultimately pass to SOPAC but it never did.|$|E

5|$|Hibernian played {{its first}} match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club {{first moved to}} the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This {{location}} {{had the advantage of}} being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get started again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Hurricane Centre issued seven bulletins on the storm, {{though the}} system only briefly entered the centre's {{response}} zone before it dissipated. Due to moisture from Nicole {{combined with the}} extratropical storm, the Atlantic Storm Prediction Centre issued heavy rainfall and wind warnings for large portions of the Canadian Maritimes. The remnants of Nicole, combined with a powerful extratropical storm, produced strong winds across the Maritimes, including over 80mph (130km/h) on western Cape Breton. The strong winds uprooted trees and downed power lines, while the winds combined with rough seas cancelled ferry crossings and <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> to the Confederation Bridge. The storm complex also dropped over 2inches (60mm) of rainfall, causing flooding in eastern Nova Scotia. The storm's passage {{during the middle of}} apple harvest caused troubles for Annapolis Valley.|$|E
5|$|The dispute did not delay work. Although {{progress}} on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict {{the scope of the}} project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site. At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state. Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago. Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with <b>restricted</b> <b>access,</b> but it looked more like a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.|$|E

5|$|These {{complexes}} {{were usually}} {{located in the}} site core, beside a principal plaza. Maya palaces consisted of a platform supporting a multiroom range structure. The term acropolis, in a Maya context, refers to a complex of structures built upon platforms of varying height. Palaces and acropoleis were essentially elite residential compounds. They generally extended horizontally {{as opposed to the}} towering Maya pyramids, and often had <b>restricted</b> <b>access.</b> Some structures in Maya acropoleis supported roof combs. Rooms often had stone benches, used for sleeping, and holes indicate where curtains once hung. Large palaces, such as at Palenque, could be fitted with a water supply, and sweat baths were often found within the complex, or nearby. During the Early Classic, rulers were sometimes buried underneath the acropolis complex. Some rooms in palaces were true throne rooms; in the royal palace of Palenque {{there were a number of}} throne rooms that were used for important events, including the inauguration of new kings.|$|E
5|$|To {{insulate}} {{the sacred}} {{power in the}} sanctuary from the impurities of the outside world, the Egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> to them. People other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues. The only exception was during festival processions, when the statue was carried out of the temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine. People did have less direct means of interaction. The more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer, from doorways to freestanding chapels near {{the back of the}} temple building. Communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use, and some families had shrines inside their homes. Despite the gulf that separated humanity from the divine, the Egyptians were surrounded by opportunities to approach their gods.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Rammasun {{passed a}} short {{distance}} west of Cheju-do, an island offshore South Korea, dropping more than 300mm (12in) of rainfall. High surf killed one person on the island, and officials <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> to Hallasan mountain and all parks. Seven boats were damaged, and many roads on the island were flooded. Before Rammasun struck the South Korean mainland, airline officials canceled 167flights. There were three deaths on the mainland, including one boy who drowned in floodwaters. Damage in the country totaled $9.5million, much of it property damage; there was also damage to the rice crop. Rainfall extended into neighboring North Korea, damaging rice and maize. Later, Rammasun brought the average monthly rainfall in only two days in portions of Primorsky Krai, causing flooding along roads and riverways.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} the area {{currently}} classified a World Heritage Site was under <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> and protection during the imperial era and has been under some form of legal recognition and protection since French colonization, having been incorporated into the Colony Domains Service in 1897 and the National Inventory in 1939. It has since benefited from legal municipal protection and two national laws (passed in 1982 and 1983) protecting sites of historical and national interest. The Office of the Cultural Site of Ambohimanga (OSCAR), created by the Ministry of Culture, has managed the site and its entrance fees and state subventions since 2006, when a five-year management plan was developed for implementation by the group's 30 employees. These management and conservation activities are conducted {{in cooperation with the}} local population within the Rural Commune of Ambohimanga Rova. The Village Committee, comprising representatives of all the adjacent quarters and the local community, are also involved in the protection of the site. Conservation of Ambohimanga is further supported by a private association, Mamelomaso, which has also been active in campaigning for awareness and protection of cultural heritage and has contributed to the preservation of numerous other sites of cultural and historic significance in the highlands. In addition to helping replant the Ambohimanga woodlands, Mamelomaso has contributed to the restoration of the stones around the source of the spring, erected informational plaques around the hill, and paved a number of footpaths within the site. UNESCO contributed special financial support to restore historic structures at Ambohimanga threatened by exceptionally heavy rainfall and landslides.|$|E
