25|$|Helix pomatia, {{common names}} the <b>Roman</b> <b>snail,</b> Burgundy snail, edible snail or escargot, is {{a species of}} large, edible, {{air-breathing}} land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Helicidae.

25|$|Metallothioneins have diverse metal-binding preferences, {{which have}} been {{associated}} with functional specificity.

40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} of the present research was {{to carry out a}} comparative assessment of copper, zinc, and selenium concentrations in the meat of edible land snails collected in Poland (Helix pomatia, Cornu aspersum maxima, and Cornu aspersum aspersum), as well as to determine the effect of preliminary processing of <b>Roman</b> <b>snails</b> (Helix pomatia) on the content of the aforementioned elements. Material and Methods: In the first stage, determinations were made on unprocessed snail meat. In the second stage, the study focused on <b>Roman</b> <b>snails</b> and consisted in an additional evaluation of frozen meat after full processing. Zinc and copper contents were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry and the selenium content was established by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: The selenium content differed significantly among all three species. The copper content in <b>Roman</b> <b>snails</b> differed significantly from that in farmed snails. No significant difference in the zinc level was noted among the three snail species. The selenium content in raw and processed meat of <b>Roman</b> <b>snails</b> did not show any significant difference while the copper and zinc level was significantly higher in processed meat samples. Conclusion: The present research on the meat of edible snails showed different levels of selenium, copper, and zinc, depending on the species, collection site, and subjection to processing...|$|R

50|$|Cows {{provided}} milk, and oxen and mules did {{the heavy}} {{work on the}} farm. Sheep and goats were cheese producers, and were prized for their hides.

50|$|Many {{species of}} molluscs, {{including}} gastropods such as whelks, bivalves such as scallops, cockles, mussels, and clams, and cephalopods such as octopuses and squids are collected or hunted for food.

60|$|Occasionally, too, very minute land-snails {{would arrive}} alive {{on the island}} after their long sea-voyage on bits of broken forest-trees--a {{circumstance}} which I would perhaps hesitate to mention in mere human society were it not that I have been credibly informed your own great naturalist, Darwin, tried the experiment himself {{with one of the}} biggest European land-molluscs, the great edible <b>Roman</b> <b>snail,</b> and found that it still lived on in vigorous style after immersion in sea-water for twenty days. Now, I myself observed that several of these bits of broken trees, torn down by floods in heavy storm time from the banks of Spanish or Portuguese rivers, reached my island in eight or ten days after leaving the mainland, and sometimes contained eggs of small land-snails. But as very long periods often passed without a single new species being introduced into the group, any kind that once managed to establish itself on any of the islands usually remained for ages undisturbed by new arrivals, and so had plenty of opportunity to adapt itself perfectly by natural selection to the new conditions. The consequence was, that out of some seventy land-snails now known in the islands, thirty-two had assumed distinct specific features before the advent of man, while thirty-seven (many of which, I think, I never noticed till the introduction of cultivated plants) are common to my group with Europe or with the other Atlantic islands. Most of these, I believe, came in with man and his disconcerting agriculture.|$|E
60|$|Belladonna {{has never}} fairly taken root in English soil. It remains, like the <b>Roman</b> <b>snail</b> and the Portuguese slug, a mere casual {{straggler}} about its ancient haunts. But {{there are other}} plants which have fairly established their claim to be considered as native-born Britons, though they came to us at first as aliens and colonists from foreign parts. Such, to take a single case, {{is the history of}} the common alexanders, now a familiar weed around villages and farmyards, but only introduced into England as a pot-herb about the eighth or ninth century. It was long grown in cottage gardens for table purposes, but has for ages been superseded in that way by celery. Nevertheless, it continues to grow all about our lanes and hedges, side by side with another quaintly-named plant, bishop-weed or gout-weed, whose very titles in themselves bear curious witness to its original uses in this isle of Britain. I don't know why, but it is an historical fact that the early prelates of the English Church, saintly or otherwise, were peculiarly liable to that very episcopal disease, the gout. Whether their frequent fasting produced this effect; whether, as they themselves piously alleged, it was due to constant kneeling on the cold stones of churches; or whether, as their enemies rather insinuated, it was due in greater measure to the excellent wines presented to them by their Italian confrères, is a minute question to be decided by Mr. Freeman, not by the present humble inquirer. But the fact remains that bishops and gout got indelibly associated in the public mind; that the episcopal toes were looked upon as especially subject to that insidious disease up to {{the very end of the}} last century; and that they do say the bishops even now--but I refrain from the commission of scandalum magnatum. Anyhow, this particular weed was held to be a specific for the bishop's evil; and, being introduced and cultivated for the purpose, it came to be known indifferently to herbalists as bishop-weed and gout-weed. It has now long since ceased to be a recognised member of the British Pharmacopoeia, but, having overrun our lanes and thickets in its flush period, it remains to this day a visible botanical and etymological memento of the past twinges of episcopal remorse.|$|E
50|$|Heliciculture is {{the farming}} of snails. Some {{species such as}} the <b>Roman</b> <b>Snail</b> are {{protected}} in the wild in several European countries and must not be collected, but the <b>Roman</b> <b>Snail</b> and the Garden Snail (Cornu aspersum) are cultivated on snail farms.|$|E
40|$|Electrospray {{ionization}} (ESI) mass {{spectra of}} both well-characterized and novel metallothioneins (MTs) from various species were recorded {{to explore their}} metal-ion-binding modes and stoichiometries. The ESI mass spectra of the zinc- and cadmium-binding MTs showed a single main peak corresponding to metal-to-protein ratios of 4, 6, or 7. These findings combined with data obtained by other methods suggest that these MTs bind zinc or cadmium in a single predominant form and {{are consistent with the}} presence of three- and four-metal clusters. An unstable copper-specific MT isoform from <b>Roman</b> <b>snails</b> (Helix pomatia) could be isolated intact and was shown to preferentially bind 12 copper ions. To obtain additional information on the formation and relative stability of metal-thiolate clusters in MTs, a mass spectrometric titration study was conducted. One to seven molar equivalents of zinc or of cadmium were added to metal-free human MT- 2 at neutral pH, and the resulting complexes were measured by ESI mass spectrometry. These experiments revealed that the formation of the four-metal cluster and of the thermodynamically less stable three-metal cluster is sequential and largely cooperative for both zinc and cadmium. Minor intermediate forms between metal-free MT, Me 4 MT, and fully reconstituted Me 7 MT were also observed. The addition of increasing amounts of cadmium to metal-free blue crab MT-I resulted in prominent peaks whose masses were consistent with apoMT, Cd 3 MT, and Cd 6 MT, reflecting the known structure of this MT with two Me 3 Cys 9 centers. In a similar reconstitution experiment performed with Caenorhabditis elegans MT-II, a series of signals corresponding to apoMT and Cd 3 MT to Cd 6 MT species were observed...|$|R

The <b>Roman</b> <b>snail</b> (Helix pomatia), for example, possesses a copper-selective isoform involved in homeostatic regulation of copper, whereas a cadmium-specific isoform is responsible for the detoxification of this metal by binding it selectively The genes of these isoforms can be upregulated differentially by metal exposure and non-metallic stressors, thus constituting an impressive example for the adaptive diversification of a gene family towards accomplishing trace element-specific physiological tasks ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Populations of Helix pomatia L. in Poland {{have been}} commercially {{exploited}} since 1951; the snails are mostly exported. The {{growing interest in}} the <b>Roman</b> <b>snail</b> on the European market has resulted in its in-creased exploitation, in some areas leading to a considerable decrease in its abundance. Introducing export quota in 1964 did not prevent overexploitation. Precise assessment of abundance and distribution of the Ro-man snail populations in areas where it is exploited is necessary. In 2009 the team from the Faculty of Biology, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznañ, conducted a preliminary assessment and mapping of the abundance and distribution of the <b>Roman</b> <b>snail</b> populations in Kujawsko-Pomorskie voivodeship. Most populations showed a low density. From scientific point of view the most reasonable solution would be to suspend exploita-tion in 2010 and continue monitoring, while decisions to issue permits for limited exploitation should be post-poned till 2011. It would enable a more detailed estimation of the non-exploited populations and an assess-ment of losses resulting from exploitation of controlled reference populations. In this way acceptable limits of annual commercial collecting could be set for particular parts of the voivodeship...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), {{and lead}} (Pb) can pose serious threats to {{environmental}} health {{because they tend}} to bioaccumulate in terrestrial ecosystems. We investigated under field conditions the transfer of these heavy metals in a soil-plant-snail food chain in Banat area, Romania. The main goal of this paper was to assess the <b>Roman</b> <b>snail</b> (Helix pomatia) usefulness in environmental monitoring as bioindicator of heavy metal accumulation. Eight sampling sites, selected by different history of heavy metal (HM) exposure, were chosen to be sampled for soil, nettle leaves, and newly matured snails. This study also aimed to identify the putative effects of HM accumulation in the environment on phenotypic variability in selected shell features, which included shell height (SH), relative shell height (RSH), and whorl number (WN). Results Significantly higher amounts of HMs were accumulated in snail hepatopancreas and not in foot. Cu, Zn, and Cd have biomagnified in the snail body, particularly in the hepatopancreas. In contrast, Pb decreased when going up into the food chain. Zn, Cd, and Pb correlated highly with each other {{at all levels of the}} investigated food chain. Zn and Pb exhibited an effective soil–plant transfer, whereas in the snail body only foot Cu concentration was correlated with that in soil. There were significant differences among sampling sites for WN, SH, and RSH when compared with reference snails. WN was strongly correlated with Cd and Pb concentrations in nettle leaves but not with Cu and Zn. SH was independent of HM concentrations in soil, snail hepatopancreas, and foot. However, SH correlated negatively with nettle leaves concentrations for each HM except Cu. In contrast, RSH correlated significantly only with Pb concentration in hepatopancreas. Conclusions The snail hepatopancreas accumulates high amounts of HMs, and therefore, this organ can function as a reliable biomarker for tracking HM bioavailability in soil. Long-term exposure to HMs via contaminated food might influence the variability of shell traits in snail populations. Therefore, our results highlight the <b>Roman</b> <b>snail</b> (Helix pomatia) potential to be used in environmental monitoring studies as bioindicator of HM pollution. </p...|$|E
