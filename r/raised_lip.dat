2500|$|Brody Costa et al. {{suggest that}} women's vaginal orgasm {{consistency}} {{is associated with}} being told in childhood or adolescence that the vagina is the important zone for inducing female orgasm. Other proposed factors include how well women focus mentally on vaginal sensations during penile-vaginal intercourse, the greater duration of intercourse, and preference for above-average penis length. Costa theorizes that vaginal orgasm is more prevalent among women with a prominent tubercle of the upper lip. His research indicates that [...] " [...] prominent and sharply <b>raised</b> <b>lip</b> tubercle {{has been associated with}} greater odds (odds ratio = 12.3) of ever having a vaginal orgasm, and also with greater past month vaginal orgasm consistency (an effect driven by the women who never had a vaginal orgasm), than less prominent lip tubercle categories." [...] However, lip tubercle was not associated with social desirability responding, or with orgasm triggered by masturbation during penile-vaginal sex, solitary or partner clitoral or vaginal masturbation, vibrator, or cunnilingus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{format of}} the desco, usually about 50 to 60cm across, is with twelve or sixteen sides, or from about 1430, round, {{enclosed}} within a slightly <b>raised</b> <b>lip</b> integral to the panel. [...] Some examples that are now round seem to have originally been twelve-sided. [...] Some have dates that record {{the day of the}} birth (or marriage) concerned. Only about two dozen desci survive, some now with the surfaces sawn apart by dealers in modern times, to create two works. In inventories they are often described as [...] "broken" [...] or [...] "old", and most apparently were used as trays until too scruffy to keep.

Examples from the 16th-century tend to have a more raised bowl-like profile, as in the Pontormo, as if echoing the new maiolica shapes. [...] Production of painted cassoni ceased over the same decades.|$|E

Finally, a parameter (eyebrows 1) driving the eyebrow movements was extracted as it may convey prosodic information (Granstrom and House 2005).|$|R

50|$|The usual {{wide and}} flat European <b>raised</b> <b>lip</b> {{is derived from}} old European {{metalwork}} plate shapes; Chinese ceramic plates usually just curve up at the edges, or have a narrow lip. A completely flat serving plate, only practical for dry foods, may be called a trencher, especially if in wood.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} boot liners which are {{with a very}} high <b>raised</b> <b>lip</b> usually made from TPE or a form of {{thermoplastic}} material that is vacuum formed to offer protection {{right up to the}} sides. Whilst they offer good protection, they are much less flexible in terms of removal and cleaning.|$|E

A tire burst as it struck the <b>raised</b> <b>lip</b> of the runway. When removing the airplane from the runway the undercarriage collapsed, causing substantial {{damage to the}} aircraft. The aircraft was occupied by 3 crew and 20 passengers. There were no fatalities.|$|E

50|$|A capuchon is a <b>raised</b> <b>lip</b> at {{the front}} of a ship's funnel or railway steam {{locomotive}} chimney. It is intended to prevent down draughts when in motion and encourage smoke to rise. Sometimes capuchons were made of plate steel bolted or welded in place, others were {{an integral part of the}} chimney casting. The name derives from their resemblance to a type of ceremonial hat.|$|E
50|$|Frying pans {{typically}} resemble skillets (hence {{the name}} 'frying pan') {{in that they}} have a diameter of 20 to 28 centimeters, a <b>raised</b> <b>lip</b> and a handle. However, all the decoration tends to be on the outside rim and on the base. The decoration is stamped or incised. The handles vary a great deal (more so on the mainland). It is worth noting that some think the term 'handle' may be slightly misleading as some of the handles seem more decorative than utilitarian.|$|E
5000|$|Formed channel letters {{feature a}} molded plastic backer with a <b>raised</b> <b>lip.</b> A plastic molded cover snaps over the base. The cover, or face, can be flat, round or [...] "prismatic" [...] (faceted face) and {{is made from}} {{translucent}} light-diffusing colored plastic. Light is emitted from both the face and {{the sides of the}} letter. Cut vinyl can also be applied to the face to create various colored light effects, or to produce a halo effect. The plastic face can also be made with a translucent chrome finish so the letters appear chrome by day, but still light up at night.|$|E

5000|$|The dry chalk of the Somme was {{especially}} suited to mining, {{but with the}} aid of pumps, it was also possible to mine in the sodden clay of Flanders. Specialist tunneling companies, usually made up of men who had been miners in civilian life, would dig tunnels under no man's land and beneath the enemy's trenches. These mines would then be packed with explosives and detonated, producing a large crater. The crater served two purposes: it could destroy or breach the enemy's trench and, by virtue of the <b>raised</b> <b>lip</b> that they produced, could provide a ready-made [...] "trench" [...] closer to the enemy's line. When a mine was detonated, both sides would race to occupy and fortify the crater.|$|E
50|$|Professional sheet pans used in {{commercial}} kitchens typically {{are made of}} aluminum, with a 1 in <b>raised</b> <b>lip</b> around the edge, and in the United States come in standard sizes. The full-size sheet pan is 26 by 18 in, which is too large for most home ovens. A two thirds sheet pan (also {{referred to as a}} three quarter size sheet pan) is 21 by 15 in. A half sheet pan is 18 by 13 in; quarter sheets are 9 by 13 in. The half sheet is approximately the same size as mass-market baking sheets found in supermarkets, and the quarter sheet is a common size for rectangular, single-layer cakes. Other commercial kitchen equipment, such as cooling racks, ovens, and shelving, is made to fit these standard pans.|$|E
5000|$|The shell has an ovate, ventricose shape. The pointed spire is {{composed}} of six or seven convex whorls. It is ornamented upon its whole surface with granular, longitudinal folds, and transverse striae. The suture is very distinct, formed by a small canal, and bordered with closer tubercles, principally upon the body whorl. This is very much inflated, and composes {{almost half of the}} shell. The aperture is rounded. The thin outer lip is arcuated. It is folded upon the edge, ornamented internally with raised striae, which are continued within the shell. The inner lip expands upon the columella, which is truncated towards the top, and extends like a <b>raised</b> <b>lip</b> towards the base. It is covered lengthwise by two or three slightly marked, oblique folds. The interior of this shell is of a diaphanous white, like the surface, which, moreover, is covered with reddish clouds.|$|E

50|$|A hazard {{is an area}} of a {{golf course}} in the sport of golf which {{provides}} a difficult obstacle, which may be of two types: (1) water hazards such as lakes and rivers; and (2) man-made hazards such as bunkers. Special rules apply to playing balls that fall in a hazard. For example, a player may not touch the ground with his club before playing a ball, not even for a practice swing. A ball in any hazard may be played as it lies without penalty. If it cannot be played from the hazard, the ball may be hit from another location, generally with a penalty of one stroke. The Rules of Golf govern exactly from where the ball may be played outside a hazard. Bunkers (or sand traps) are shallow pits filled with sand and generally incorporating a <b>raised</b> <b>lip</b> or barrier, from which the ball is more difficult to play than from grass.|$|E

5000|$|The fringes act {{very much}} like the lines on a {{topography}} map, where the fringes are always perpendicular to the wedge between the surfaces. When wringing first begins, there is a large angle in the air wedge and the fringes will resemble grid topography-lines. If the fringes are straight; then the surface is flat. If the surfaces are allowed to fully wring and become parallel, the straight fringes will widen until only a dark fringe remains, and they will disappear completely. If the surface is not flat, the grid lines will have some bends in them, indicating the topography of the surface. Straight fringes with bends in them may indicate a raised elevation or a depression. Straight fringes with a [...] "V" [...] shape in the middle indicate a ridge or valley running across the center, while straight fringes with curves near the ends indicate edges that are either rounded-off or have a <b>raised</b> <b>lip.</b>|$|E

50|$|The CSL {{also had}} various {{aesthetic}} modifications over the standard M3. It received an aerodynamic lightweight body kit which included carbon fibre front splitters that improved down force {{at high speeds}} by 50%, {{as well as a}} carbon fibre rear diffuser. The front bumper had a distinct hole that is used to draw cool air into the newly designed air intake. The trunk floor cover was made of lightweight fibre-board (not cardboard as infamously described by BBC Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson). The trunk lid was redesigned to incorporate a <b>raised</b> <b>lip,</b> unlike the standard M3 where one is simply added onto a flat trunk. The CSL was sold with distinct 19-inch lightweight cast BBS alloy rims that came with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup semi-slick racing tyres. The interior of the CSL is redesigned with a sporty weight-saving theme. The CSL obtains fibreglass front racing bucket seats, and fibreglass backed rear seats. The center console, door panels and trim, and head-liner are all formed from carbon fibre, and the steering wheel is redesigned with cruise control, stereo, and phone controls removed to include just a single button that activates the M track mode.|$|E

For example, a player may {{not touch the}} ground or water with their club before playing the ball, not even for a {{practice}} swing. A ball in any hazard may be played as it lies without penalty. If it cannot be played from the hazard, the ball may be hit from another location, generally with a penalty of one stroke. The Rules of Golf specify exactly the point from which the ball may be played outside a hazard. Bunkers are small to medium areas, usually lower than the fairway but of varying topography, that are filled with sand and generally incorporate a <b>raised</b> <b>lip</b> or barrier. It {{is more difficult to}} play the ball from sand than from grass, as the ball may embed itself into the sand, and the loose nature of the sand and more severe sloping of many bunkers make taking one's stance more difficult. As in any hazard, a ball in a bunker must be played without touching the sand with the club except during the stroke, and loose impediments (leaves, stones, twigs) must not be moved before making the stroke.|$|E
