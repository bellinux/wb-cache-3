5|$|The Pizza Burger is {{a burger}} sold {{exclusively}} at the BK Whopper Bar location in Times Square, New York City that {{was introduced in}} September 2010. It consists of four Whopper patties on a 9.5inch sesame bun, sliced into six pieces and topped with pepperoni, mozzarella, basil pesto and marinara sauce. The whole burger contains more than the <b>recommended</b> <b>daily</b> allowance of calories for men at 2,520 calories, with 144grams of fat, 59g of which is saturated, and 3,780mg of sodium, {{more than double the}} <b>recommended</b> <b>daily</b> allowance for adults. However, according to Burger King's Vice President of global marketing, John Schaufelberger, the burger is not intended to feed just one person. Each slice has 420 calories, 24g fat (10g saturated), and 630mg sodium.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion {{was invented}} by Nariman Mehta of Burroughs Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) in 1969, and the US patent for it was granted in 1974. It was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antidepressant on 30 December 1985, and marketed under the name Wellbutrin. However, a significant incidence of epileptic seizures at the originally recommended dosage caused the withdrawal of the drug in 1986. Subsequently, the risk of seizures was found to be highly dose-dependent, and bupropion was re-introduced to the market in 1989 with a lower maximum <b>recommended</b> <b>daily</b> dose.|$|E

5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the <b>recommended</b> <b>daily</b> amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E

40|$|Background: The regular use {{of simple}} analgesics in {{addition}} to opioids such as paracetamol (or acetaminophen) is recommended for persistent pain to enhance analgesia. Few {{studies have examined the}} frequency and doses of paracetamol among people with chronic non-cancer pain including use above the <b>recommended</b> maximum <b>daily</b> dose. Aims: To assess (i) the prevalence of paracetamol use among people with chronic non-cancer pain prescribed opioids, (ii) assess the prevalence of paracetamol use above the <b>recommended</b> maximum <b>daily</b> dose and (iii) assess correlates of people who used paracetamol above the <b>recommended</b> maximum <b>daily</b> dose including: age, gender, income, education, pain severity and interference, use of paracetamol/opioid combination analgesics, total opioid dose, depression, anxiety, pain self-efficacy or comorbid substance use, among people prescribed opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Methods: This study draws on baseline data collected for the Pain and Opioids IN Treatment (POINT) study and utilises data from 962 interviews and medication diaries. The POINT study is national prospective cohort of people with chronic non-cancer pain prescribed opioids. Participants were recruited from randomly selected pharmacies across Australia. Results: Sixty-three per cent of the participants had used paracetamol in the past week (95 % CI = 59. 7 - 65. 8). Among the paracetamol users 22 % (95 % CI = 19. 3 - 24. 6) had used paracetamol/opioid combination analgesics and 4. 8 % (95 % CI = 3. 6 - 6. 3) had used paracetamol above the <b>recommended</b> maximum <b>daily</b> dose (i. e. > 4000 mg/day). Following binomial logistic regression (chi(2) = 25. 98, df = 10, p = 0. 004), people who had taken above the <b>recommended</b> maximum <b>daily</b> dose were less likely to have low income (AOR = 0. 52, 95 % CI = 0. 27 - 0. 99), more likely to use paracetamol/opioid combination analgesics (AOR = 2. 01, 95 % CI = 1. 02 - 3. 98) and more likely to take a higher opioid dose (AOR = 1. 00, 95 % CI = 1. 00 - 1. 01). Conclusion: The majority of people with chronic non-cancer pain prescribed opioids report using paracetamol appropriately. High income, use of paracetamol/opioid combination analgesics and higher opioid dose were independently associated with paracetamol use above the <b>recommended</b> maximum <b>daily</b> dose...|$|R

25|$|Milk {{is not an}} {{important}} source of vitamins B12 or E in the North American diet, so the effects of pasteurization on the adult daily intake of these vitamins is negligible.. However, milk is considered {{an important}} source of vitamin A, and because pasteurization appears to increase vitamin A concentrations in milk, the effect of milk heat treatment on this vitamin is a not a major public health concern. Results of meta-analyses revealed that pasteurization of milk leads to a significant decrease in vitamin C and folate, but milk also is not {{an important source of}} these vitamins. However, we did find a significant decrease in vitamin B2 concentrations after pasteurization. Vitamin B2 is typically found in bovine milk at concentrations of 1.83mg/liter. Because the <b>recommended</b> <b>daily</b> intake for adults is 1.1mg/day, milk consumption greatly contributes to the <b>recommended</b> <b>daily</b> intake of this vitamin. With the exception of B2, pasteurization {{does not appear to be}} a concern in diminishing the nutritive value of milk because milk is often not a primary source of these studied vitamins in the North American diet.|$|E
25|$|Biotin {{deficiency}} is rare. The amounts needed are small, a {{wide range}} of foods contain biotin, and intestinal bacteria synthesize biotin, which is then absorbed by the host animal.

Instead, an Adequate Intake (AI) is identified based on the theory that average intake meets needs. Future research could result in biotin AIs with EARs and RDAs (see Dietary Reference Intake section).|$|E

25|$|Adrenaline {{is added}} to {{injectable}} forms {{of a number of}} local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine and lidocaine, as a vasoconstrictor to slow the absorption and, therefore, prolong the action of the anesthetic agent. Due to epinephrine's vasoconstricting abilities, the use of epinephrine in localized anesthetics also helps to diminish the total blood loss the patient sustains during minor surgical procedures. Some of the adverse effects of local anesthetic use, such as apprehension, tachycardia, and tremor, may be caused by adrenaline. Epinephrine/adrenaline is frequently combined with dental and spinal anesthetics and can cause panic attacks in susceptible patients {{at a time when they}} may be unable to move or speak due to twilight anesthesia. Currently the maximum <b>recommended</b> <b>daily</b> dosage for people in a dental setting requiring local anesthesia with a peripheral vasoconstrictor is 10µg/lb of total body weight.|$|E
25|$|Approximately {{one half}} of drug-related taste distortions are caused by a zinc deficiency. Many {{medications}} are known to chelate, or bind, zinc, preventing the element from functioning properly. Due to the causal relationship of insufficient zinc levels to taste disorders, {{research has been conducted}} to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation as a possible treatment for dysgeusia. In a randomized clinical trial, fifty patients suffering from idiopathic dysgeusia were given either zinc or a lactose placebo. The patients prescribed the zinc reported experiencing improved taste function and less severe symptoms compared to the control group, suggesting that zinc may be a beneficial treatment. The efficacy of zinc, however, has been ambiguous in the past. In a second study, 94% of patients who were provided with zinc supplementation did not experience any improvement in their condition. This ambiguity is most likely due to small sample sizes and the wide range of causes of dysgeusia. A <b>recommended</b> <b>daily</b> oral dose of 25–100mg appears to be an effective treatment for taste dysfunction provided that there are low levels of zinc in the blood serum. There is not a sufficient amount of evidence {{to determine whether or not}} zinc supplementation is able to treat dysgeusia when low zinc concentrations are not detected in the blood.|$|E
