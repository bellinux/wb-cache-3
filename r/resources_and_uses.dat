We understand by system analysis the consideration of a complex made by related parts, and not merely a totally of parts, where the significance of one thing depends on its relationship with the others. Based on this criteria of interconnections between phenomena, we assume, we are going to give the coastal zone a treatment of a system and in this way impose a correlative statement to the information related to this area.

Low-Carbon Resources include low-consumption energy like {{renewable}} resources, new energy, clean power, etc. From {{the perspective}} of fiscal policy, to study and develop R&D will affect the progress of technology directly, and to develop Low-Carbon Economy needs the innovation of Low-Carbon technology. Thus, the government’s R&D investment is crucial to developing Low-Carbon technology and Low-Carbon Economy. This thesis combines the endogenous growth theory with the sustainability of Low-Carbon <b>Resources,</b> <b>and</b> <b>uses</b> the R&D endogenous growth model to give one under the constraint of Low-Carbon resources. It comes to a relevant conclusion, that is, assuming that the society requires a sustainable consumption in consuming the rest of exhaustible resource, the labor investment of R&D sectors should meet the basic conditions...|$|E

The rollback mechanism uses compensating operations to roll back {{the effects of the}} agent execution on the <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>uses</b> a mixture of physical logging and compensating operations to rollback the state of the agent. The introduction of different types of compensating operations and the integration of an itinerary concept with the rollback mechanism allows performance improvements during the agent rollback as well as during the normal agent execution...|$|E

40|$|Analyses of {{national}} markets for organic agricultural products are {{constrained by the}} lack of official statistics on production, consumption or international trade in any European country. As a result there are several, often very contradictory and inconsistent estimations on the amount of the organic production or consumption in the EU or even in individual EU countries. The main sources for market data estima-tions are surveys with market actors and sometimes extrapolations of household or retailer panel studies. One possibility to reduce the problem of inconsistent market data for a geographical region is to use the method of supply balance sheets (SBS). By using SBS which compare the <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>uses</b> of a product, it is easier to detect inconsistencies between produc-tion, consumption or foreign trade data. Additional quality checks can support the identification of inconsistencies between organic and conventional market data...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the design and implementation of a system called the Network Weather Service (NWS) that takes periodic measurements of deliverable resource performance from distributed networked <b>resources,</b> <b>and</b> <b>uses</b> numerical models to dynamically generate forecasts of future performance levels.

We describe the architecture of the NWS and implementations that we have developed and are currently deploying for the Legion [13] and Globus/Nexus [7] metacomputing infrastructures. We also detail NWS forecasts of resource performance using both the Legion and Globus/Nexus implementations. Our results show that simple forecasting techniques substanti [...] ...|$|E

[arXiv: 1406. 7639, Int. J. Control 88 (10), 2015], each agent uses one out of multiple resources at each time instant. The per-use cost of a resource depends on the number of concurrent users. A central authority has up-to-date knowledge of the congestion across all <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>uses</b> randomisation to provide a scalar or an interval for each resource at each time. In this paper, the interval to broadcast per resource is obtained by taking the minima and maxima of costs observed within a time window of length r, rather than by randomisation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Trauma {{systems have}} been shown to reduce death and {{disability}} from injury but must be appropriately configured. A systematic approach to trauma system design can help maximize geospatial effectiveness and reassure stakeholders that the best configuration has been chosen. METHODS: This article describes the GEOS [Geospatial Evaluation of Systems of Trauma Care] methodology, a mathematical modeling of a population-based data set, which aims to derive geospatially optimized trauma system configurations for a geographically defined setting. GEOS considers a region's spatial injury profile and the available <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>uses</b> a combination of travel time analysis and multiobjective optimization. The methodology is described in general and with regard to its application to our case study of Scotland. RESULTS: The primary outcome will be trauma system configuration. CONCLUSION: GEOS will contribute to the design of a trauma system for Scotland. The methodology is flexible and inherently transferable to other settings and could also be used to provide assurance that the configuration of existing trauma systems is fit for purpose...|$|E
