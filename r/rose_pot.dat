The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the prevalence of azole resistance in environmental A. fumigatus iso-lates collected in northern Italy. A. fumigatus grew from 29 of 47 soil samples analysed. Azole-resistant isolates were detected in 13 % (6 / 47) of the soil sam-ples and in 21 % (6 / 29) of the soil samples containing A. fumigatus. High minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of itraconazole (≥ 16 mg/L) and posaconazole (≥ 0. 5 mg/L) were displayed by nine isolates from six different soil samples, namely apple orchard (1 sam-ple), <b>rose</b> <b>pot</b> compost (2 samples), and cucurbit yields (3 samples). Seven isolates had a MIC= 2 mg/L of vori-conazole. Seven of nine itraconazole and posacona-zole resistant isolates harboured the same TR 34 /L 98 H mutation of cyp 51 A.

In autumn 2011 the robot’s requirements were listed and major lines decided as well as the skills needed in the project studied. The actual building started in January 2012. In the beginning of the summer the robot was in testing phase. In the competition, there were five different tasks that the robot needed to perform. The tasks included e. g. driving between rows of flower pots, finding a marked pot and cooperating with a robot from another team. In addition to RoseRunner, two implements were designed and built. The first one was designed to pick up a <b>rose</b> <b>pot</b> and carry it and the other was a fertilizing trailer performing intelligent fertilizing. When designing the robot, special attention was paid to avoid too complex structures and to make the robot easily maintainable. However, some subsystems turned out to be relatively complex, especially on the electronics side. In the beginning of the project a decision was made to make it in top three. There were 18 robots participating in the contest. RoseRunner finished second in overall competition and was the only robot to earn a position in top three in all five tasks...|$|E

A better understanding of the inheritance of vigour and its related traits will assist the breeding activities. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses were performed {{with the help of an}} integrated linkage map of a diploid rose population originating from a cross between Rosa multiflora-derived genotypes. The underlying datasets for ten vigour-related traits were collected in an evaluation study of this population in two greenhouse experiments with suboptimal temperatures for growth. We identified ten chromosomal regions, scattered over the seven linkage groups, containing QTLs for these traits. Considering each trait separately, we detected a total of 42 QTLs. Among these QTLs, 24 were found in both of the experiments, eight and ten were specific to either of the two experiments. The number of QTLs for individual traits varied from three to five with a respective contribution to the phenotypic variation from 12 to 35 %. QTLs for highly correlated traits frequently co-localized, indicating a common genetic basis. Clustering of QTLs for different traits was noted in some chromosome regions, for instance, one on chromosome 2 included major QTLs for eight of ten traits under study, suggesting co-localization of several separate genes or/and the occurrence of various genes having pleiotropic effects.

Moreover, stomatal function improved when high MOV-treated plants were subjected to leaflet desiccation and ABA feeding. Endogenous concentration of ABA and its metabolites in the leaves was reduced by 35 % in high RH, but contrary to our hypothesis this concentration was not significantly affected by high MOV. Interestingly, in detached leaflets grown at high RH, high MOV increased stomatal sensitivity to ABA since the amount of exogenous ABA required to decrease the transpiration rate was significantly reduced. This is the first study to show that high MOV increases stomatal functionality in leaves developed at high RH by reducing the stomatal pore length and aperture and enhancing stomatal sensitivity to ABA rather than increasing leaf [ABA]...|$|R

This he took up at first to please his wife, having no natural inclination; {{but he had no}} sooner set his hand to it, than, like everything else he touched, it became with him a passion. He budded <b>roses,</b> he <b>potted</b> cuttings in the coach-house; if there came a change of weather at night, he would rise out of bed to protect his favourites; when he was thrown with a dull companion, it was enough for him to discover in the man a fellow gardener; on his travels, he would go {{out of his way to}} visit nurseries and gather hints; and to the end of his life, after other occupations prevented him putting his own hand to the spade, he drew up a yearly programme for his gardener, in which all details were regulated.

40|$|Soilless {{cultivation}} {{suggests a}} closed system of water flows, {{the principal of}} which are (drip) irrigation evaporation and - in more high-tech systems -condensation water. However, in practice growers discharge water {{during the process of}} filter cleaning and also actively discharge water due to high levels of sodium or contamination with chemical or biological components. On average in the Dutch greenhouse situation 2 - 5 % of the annual irrigated water is discharged annually. These discharges lead to pollution of surface water with nutrients as well as (residues of) plant protection products (PPPs). This awareness led in 2008 to the start of a working group that aimed to develop a risk evaluation tool for pesticide authorisation in Europe. The evaluation tool consists of a modelled approach for determining expected concentrations in surface water based on a reference scenario per crop i. e., a description of an actual situation including the technical layout of the glasshouse, the climatological year and the receiving ditch For two currently registered PPPs that are used in spray applications, the annual emission to surface water was calculated using different scenarios. As scenarios, substrate-based <b>rose</b> production and <b>pot</b> plant production were selected in combination with water sources of variable sodium concentrations that commonly occur and are used in The Netherlands. Sodium was found to be the only quantifiable argument for growers for active discharge, and therefore it was used as a leading principle for discharge in the water flow model. Water discharge was found to range from 80 to 700 m 3 ha 1 year- 1, leading to nitrogen emissions of 17 to 149 kg N ha∗ year - 1.

40|$|Rose (Rosa) {{is one of}} the {{important}} ornamental crops worldwide. Greenhouse production of cut <b>rose</b> and <b>pot</b> <b>rose</b> requires much fossil fuel for optimal plant growth and is adversely affected by infection with powdery mildew (Podosphaera pannosa). The heavy energy input and frequent application of fungicides to control the disease contributes considerably to the product cost and environmental pollution. Genetic improvement of cultivars will be facilitated by {{a better understanding of the}} genetic variation and the inheritance architecture of the traits determining vigour and mildew resistance. To this end procedures were developed to screen for plant vigour and mildew resistance. These methods were subsequently used with success to study the genetic variation for the two traits present in a diploid and a tetraploid population, respectively. The populations were also molecularly characterized to enable genetic dissection of the variation of the traits. The achievements of the studies are presented in different chapters of this thesis. A high-density genetic map with a number of anchor markers was created for vigour study, using the diploid rose population (Chapter 2). Linkage maps were constructed using a total of 520 molecular markers including AFLP, SSR, PK, RGA, RFLP, SCAR and morphological markers. Seven linkage groups, each putatively corresponding to one of the seven rose chromosomes, were identified for female and male linkage groups spanning 487 cM and 490 cM, respectively. The linkage groups likely cover more than 90 % of the rose genome. The corresponding female and male linkage groups were subsequently integrated. The present linkage maps with robust types of markers are currently the most advanced ones in rose with regard to marker density and genome coverage. The mapped SSR and RFLP markers provide good anchor points for future map alignment studies. Phenotypic evaluation of the diploid population for vigour and its related traits was separately conducted in greenhouses in Denmark (DK) and The Netherlands (NL) under suboptimal growth conditions. A screening procedure for large-scale evaluation of rose genotypes for vigour was developed (Chapter 3). T he population showed a continuous quantitative variation as well as a considerable transgression for all the traits. Genetic differences among the tested entries were highly significant and tended to be large for most of the traits in comparison to the effects of genotype by environment interaction. The estimates for heritability were high (68 to 92 %) and the relationships among most of the traits were also high (r = 0. 65 to 0. 95). Total shoot dry weight and leaf area are suggested to be good criteria for early selection of rose genotypes with vigorous growth. QTL analyses for each of ten vigour-related traits identified ten chromosomal regions, scattered over the seven linkage groups, containing QTLs for one or more traits (Chapter 4). Considering each trait separately, a total of 42 QTLs was found. Among these QTLs, 24 were common in both DK and NL experiments, whereas eight were only detected in the NL experiment and ten in the DK experiment. The number of QTLs for individual traits varied from three to five, each determining 12 % to 35 % phenotypic variation. QTLs for highly correlated traits were frequently colocalized, indicating a common genetic basis. Clustering of QTLs for different traits was noted in some chromosome regions, suggesting co-localization of several separate genes or/and pleiotropy. The tetraploid population and its parents were tested for powdery mildew resistance under greenhouse conditions with two well-defined monospore isolates (2 and F 1) using artificial inoculation with spore suspensions (Chapter 5). Disease score at 11 days post inoculation, latency period and rate of symptom development were used to describe the variation in resistance within the population. The tests for both isolates exhibited a wide and significant variation among genotypes for resistance. The distribution of the genotypic means of the disease scores was continuous and showed a considerable transgression. Analysis of the data indicated that the two isolates differed in pathogenicity. It is the first time that in rose an inoculation assay with spore suspensions has been successfully used. It is a reliable and effective way to screen large numbers of genotypes under greenhouse conditions for mildew evaluation in rose genetic and breeding studies. The tetraploid population for powdery mildew resistance was further molecularly characterized to allow genetic map construction and marker-trait association analysis (Chapter 6). Uni-parental as well as bi-parental simplex AFLP and SSR markers were used to construct female and male maps. These analyses resulted in 23 and 17 separate linkage groups for the maps. The length of the respective maps was 695 and 697 cM. Multi-allelic SSR markers were successfully used to assign most of the linkage groups to one of the seven rose chromosomes. Marker-trait association analyses identified a number of marker loci presumably linked to genes for mildew resistance. These marker loci determined only a moderate part of the heritable variation. Some isolate-specific markers were found from both parents and distributed on different chromosomes, indicating polygenic resistance of the population. The findings of the present study provide knowledge of the inheritance of the target traits at molecular level, which paves the road towards marker-assisted selection for breeding of new rose cultivars with vigorous growth for more efficient energy use and durable resistance to powdery mildew. This will finally result in energy efficient in the cultivation of roses in greenhouse...|$|R
40|$|Concetta’ is a fluorescent, orange-colored <b>rose</b> {{suitable}} for <b>pot</b> forcing, landscape planting, and fresh or dried commercial cut flowers (Fig. 1). It produces few thorns {{and can be}} propagated from three-eye softwood stem cuttings or through tissue culture. Origin ‘Concetta’ (Papconc; originator or breeder, {{can be used for}} a trademark) arose as a sport (chimera) on the floribunda rose ‘Gabriella’ (Berggren), which was a mutation of ‘Mercedes’ (R. Kordes) (Krussmann, 1981). ‘Mercedes’ is a floribunda rose from a cross of an unnamed seedling with ‘Anabell’ (Kordes) (Krussmann, 1981). Culture Initial propagation was from three-eye softwood stem cuttings, which rooted readily under intermittent mist. The bottom part of the stem was dipped in 0. 3 % 1 -indole- 3 -butyric acid hormone powder. Over the last 8 years, repeated stem cuttings from the original sport and daughter plants have displayed stable characteristics. Tissue culture of axillary buds was also successful, in the four years of university research and in a commercial laboratory. Tissue culture protocol followed was that of Skirvin and Chu (1981). During tissue culture, a low mutation rate (1 % to 10 %), specifically albino flower color, was noted. All plants were planted in 18 -liter containers in a 2 soil : 1 peat : 1 perlite mix and grown in a glass greenhouse. Each week, the plants received 20 N- 13 P- 8 K fertilizer at 300 ppm N. Plants were allowed to flower continuously. New flowers formed every 5 to 8 weeks, depending on the season. Plants were cut back once a year in December. Description ‘Concetta’ is a dense, shrubby rose with an upright growth habit. Overall height at maturity is » 1 m. The general flower color is an unusual glowing orange that may appear similar to that of ‘Mercedes’. ‘Concetta’s color, however, is different and is classified as orange- orange, PMS 172 (Pantone, 1985), rather than the orange-red typical of ‘Mercedes’. Additionally, ‘Concetta’ is more floriferous, with most flowers borne singly. It is classified as a hybrid tea due to its flower shape and petalage, grows well on its own roots in the greenhouse or outside, has few thorns or prickles, and produces a superior warm-red dried flower. The flower buds are small, initially umshaped, becoming high centered as the petals curl outward. The petals are thick, ruffled, and, on maturity, reflexed with a velvety inside and smooth outside. Petal number is usually » 32 (mean of 19 flowers) with a range of 26 to 35 per bud. The flowers measure 5. 0 to 6. 3 cm across and have a slightly fruity fragrance. The foliage is medium sized and compound (five to seven leaflets). It is leathery and semi- to glossy green. Each leaflet is oval, acuminate, and finely biserrate...|$|R
40|$|Powdery mildew {{caused by}} the Podosphaera pannosa {{is one of the}} most {{widespread}} and destructive diseases in roses and has been an increasing problem in Norwegian rose production due to lack of disease resistant cultivars. In practice, roses are frequently treated with fungicides to control powdery mildew, and the most common treatment today is with evaporated sulphur. Some fungicides used against powdery mildew, including sulphur may be toxic to biological control agents. Supplementary lighting in Norwegian rose production has been practised since the late 1980 s. Previous experiments clearly indicated that continuous lighting strongly reduced powdery mildew in roses, but keeping quality was significantly reduced. The main goal of this study was to investigate the effect of different components of light on rose powdery mildew, and use this knowledge to manipulate lighting regimes for improved management of the disease. This thesis consists of three papers. Experiments with day length, light quality and light intensity were conducted with <b>pot</b> <b>roses</b> (Rosa interspecific hybrid ‘Mistral’) in growth chambers with constant temperature and air humidity. Humidity boxes with two rooms were developed and used to test for germination and formation of conidia. Inoculated leaflets were placed on water agar in the upper room of the boxes. The lower room contained saturated salt solution (KCl), which maintained constant high air humidity (96 ± 2 % RH) in both rooms. For testing of conidia formation and release from whole plants, wind tunnels were developed. Microscope films attached to clock cylinders collected the conidia released from the diseased plants. The first two - investigations was on how day length, light quality and light intensity influenced germination, production of conidia and disease development. The third study was a molecular investigation to find a phytochrome like photoreceptors in P. pannosa. A significant reduction in conidia formation and release were noticed when exposed to 20 - 24 h day length compare to 18 h day length with white light. When trapping conidia from whole plants placed in wind tunnels, exposure to continuous lighting gave only 22 % of the conidia trapped at 18 h day length. There was no significant difference in number of trapped conidia between 20, 22 or 24 h lighting. Germination of conidia was slightly, but significantly reduced when exposed to continuous full spectrum white light or 18 h day length of blue light. While far-red light induced conidia formation, red light suppressed conidia formation and release. Red light supplied in the 6 h period following 18 h white light strongly suppressed formation and release of conidia relative to a diurnal cycle of 18 h white light and 6 h darkness. If plants were exposed to a day length of 18 h provided with a full spectrum of white light, a 1 h night break with red light was sufficient to strongly suppress formation and release of conidia compared to a 1 h night break with far-red light or no night break. However, red light night break followed by far-red light night break almost nullified the suppressive effect of red light. Under full spectrum white light, formation and release of conidia increased with increasing light intensity. PCR amplification with degenerate primers were attempted to find a phytochrome like gene(s) in P. pannosa. It was not successful. Further work is needed to confirm whether P. pannosa has photo sensory receptor. At the moment, designing of more specific primers that are suitable to detect the photo sensory receptors in powdery mildew fungi by PCR is difficult. However sequencing of its genome, proteomic analysis or transcriptome sequence analysis would be other alternatives...|$|R

Specific aims of the project were to collect, evaluate, mass produce and commercially apply natural enemies of thrips species. To evaluate natural enemies we applied specified selection criteria, which had proven its value in previous pre-introduction selection of natural enemies of several other greenhouse pests. In my part of the evaluation programme, I studied what prospects hymenopterous parasitoids might have as biological control agents of thrips, in particular the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande). First (Chapter 1) I summarised available information on the thrips pests which currently play a key role in protected cultivation in Europe. In particular I looked into F. occidentalis, Thrips tabaci Lindeman and two other species that I studied: Frankliniella schultzei Trybom and Frankliniella intonsa (Trybom) and reviewed their geographical distribution, economic impact, followed by additional information on thrips biology, ecology and ways of control. Then the state of the art is discussed of the most important groups of natural enemies that are currently evaluated and/or applied as biological control agents: predatory mites, pirate bugs, entomopathogenic fungi and entomophilic nematodes. Specific emphasis is put on the current status of hymenopterous parasitoids attacking thrips, their biology, ecology and life-history and the prospects they might have for thrips control in European greenhouses. Finally, I present the aim of my research project and the outline of this thesis. When the research project started, no parasitoid of western flower thrips was known. In our search for parasitoid candidates, presented in Chapter 2, a sampling programme was developed, surveying F. occidentalis populations in its original area of distribution (USA) and newly invaded areas (South of Europe). Parasitoids of closely related thrips species, distributed worldwide, preferably from areas with climatically conditions similar to northwest European glasshouses were collected as well. Based on the host and geographic distribution records in the literature, mainly species were collected within the genus Ceranisus (Walker), solitary larval endoparasitoids of thrips species closely related to F. occidentalis. Our collection efforts resulted in a number of parasitoid species and various geographical strains, the most important being Ceranisus menes (Walker) and Ceranisus americensis (Girault) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). Both are solitary koinobiont endoparasitoids of thrips larvae that reproduce asexually. A critical phase in any evaluation programme, is the development of an adequate and reliable rearing procedure, allowing a standardised supply of insects of a constant quality and large enough quantities. For laboratory bioassays on thrips and parasitoids, and eventually mass-production, it is essential that large cohorts of even aged groups of larvae are available. In Chapter 3 we describe and evaluate laboratory methods for rearing various species of thrips, such as Frankliniella occidentalis, F. intonsa, Thrips palmi (Karny) and Thrips tabaci Lind. (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) and their parasitoids. When using a method based on honey-solution and pine pollen, large numbers could be produced of high quality, with relatively little time investment. For rearing parasitoids the method proved adequate as well, but less efficient in yield and time. A number of basic evaluation criteria for pre-introduction selection of useful natural enemies, is based on the outcome of behavioural and developmental interactions with their target host in laboratory experiments. Specific aspects of the parasitoid's host selection process are evaluated in Chapter 4 (host age selection) and chapter 5 (host species selection). Results presented in Chapter 4 show that host acceptance by C. menes and C. americensis was negatively correlated with size, age and stage of the larval host. Observations on the parasitoid's behaviour showed that the extent to which a wasp could complete and attack and oviposit significantly decreased with increasing size (age) of host larvae. The apparent preference for small sizes of larvae is largely caused by defensive reactions (walking away, wagging the abdomen, anal exudate production) upon an encounter to vehement resistance (wriggling, dragging) of the larvae when attacked and stung. In larvae smaller or equal to her own size, a wasp could manage its victim, whereas larvae larger than herself managed to escape prior or during an attack. The apparent preference for small and young host larvae is valuable for developing a mass-production system for thrips parasitoids, for the timing of releases in the greenhouse and, because only a small part of the population is prone to attack, has consequences for the population dynamics of the host and the parasitoid. Although in a greenhouse grown crop F. occidentalis often is the major, but not the only thrips species around it is important to know the host preference of the parasitoids with respect to different species. No-choice tests, presented in Chapter 5 show that differences in the behaviour and biology of both the host and the parasitoid species strongly influenced their development and fitness. On the species level as well as on the population level parasitoids differed in host acceptance behaviour, parasitoid developmental time and size of their offspring. C. americensis preformed best on its original co-evolved host F. occidentalis. C. menes consists of a large complex of regional populations, that either reproduce sexually or asexually. They differ morphologically, geographically, behaviourally and physiologically in their response to different geographical populations of thrips species, each of them having its unique characteristics. Life-history studies performed on C. menes and C. americensis in the laboratory (Chapter 6) shows that developmental and reproductive biology were significantly affected by temperature and characteristic for each species / strain. It was found that immature developmental time took much longer when temperature decreased, in particular for C. americensis. Pupal development times in C. menes varied greatly at both temperatures for certain types (yellow) but not for others (brown). Both species have different reproduction strategies: C. americensis has a higher daily reproduction, but a shorter reproduction period, compared to various strains of C. menes, that reproduce less during a longer period. The population growth rates differed per species / strain and temperature, but where in almost all cases lower than (literature) data of F. occidentalis. In Chapter 7 it is shown that short-range host location by C. menes and C. americensis is positively affected by visual and chemical stimuli. Both species are attracted to yellow colours and were arrested on sites were larvae had been feeding. Wasps did react to the presence or damage inflicted by feeding of non-hosts, but arrestment did not seem to be very host specific: within a parasitoid species no difference was found in reaction to feeding spots of one host species, Thrips tabaci or another F. occidentalis. Parasitoid females were not attracted to the synthetic compounds of the alarm pheromone (decylacetate plus dodecylacetate) of western flower thrips in short-range flight tests, indicating a non-volatile effect. In Chapter 8 evaluation studies were performed on a larger scale: experimental and commercial greenhouses. In spite of repeated introductions in infested crops, either vegetables like sweet pepper and cucumber, or ornamentals like <b>rose</b> and <b>potted</b> plants, very low levels of parasitism were found. Searching efficiency and dispersal ability in a greenhouse crop were very low and parasitoids performed poorly under (temperate) greenhouse conditions. Both parasitoid species could maintain themselves, dispersed and reproduced at Dutch glasshouse conditions, but they were unable to reduce thrips populations to sufficiently low levels. Finally, in Chapter 9, I summarise and discuss the main results of my research, placed in perspective of the pre-introduction criteria we used. It is concluded that, based on behavioural (host selection and searching efficiency), biological (climatic adaptation, development and reproduction capacity) and practical (mass-production) characteristics, thrips parasitoids have very limited prospects for greenhouse biological control for both seasonal inoculative and inundative release programmes in temperate and in Mediterranean greenhouses. </font...|$|R
