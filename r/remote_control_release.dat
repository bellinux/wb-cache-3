30|$|In {{order to}} obtain the {{well-defined}} molecular-weight-distribution polymers, dual functional tri-block copolymer, P(AA-b-NIPAAm-b-AA), was synthesized by reversible addition- fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization in this research. The temperature-inducing self-assembling characteristic of the tri-block copolymers provide the excellence in drug encapsulation, owing to the interaction between hydrophobic PNIPAAm and hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) segments. Surface-modified iron oxide (Fe 3 O 4 -NH 2) was introduced into the system via N-hydroxysuccinamide (NHS) and 1 -[3 -(dimethylamino)propyl]- 3 -ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) crosslinking method. Fe 3 O 4 -NH 2 provided not only the stability of nanoparticles but also the ability of magnetic controlled release. After the encapsulated model drug, Rhodamine 6 G (R 6 G), it gives the optical functionality via fluorescence labeling; the releasing behavior of R 6 G-loaded nanocarriers was studied under the condition of various temperatures and pH values. Furthermore, an external high-frequency magnetic field (HFMF) was applied for the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>release</b> of our intelligent magnetic nanocarriers.|$|E

50|$|His best-known {{body of work}} {{perhaps is}} “Self Portraits by Heterosexual Men.” In 1998, Martinez created ambrotypes from ‘self-portraits’ {{recorded}} on 35mm film by one hundred, presumably straight men who took the shots {{at the point of}} manually, self-induced ecstasy (with the assistance of a cable release). In 2007, Martinez revisited this project arming the performers with a digital camera and a <b>remote</b> <b>controlled</b> shutter <b>release</b> with multi-exposure capabilities. This allowed the men to snap several photos during the time of expulsion and gave Martinez the ability to select the most expressive image for the individual giving insight on the location and objects the performer kept around {{at the time of the}} act.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Austrian state road Silvretta Straße B 188 {{is located}} in the avalanche-exposed Paznaun Valley. During the winter this road is an {{important}} transport link, but has to be closed regular-ly due to high avalanche risk. Within a pilot-project seven avalanche towers (<b>remote</b> <b>controlled</b> ava-lanche <b>releasing</b> systems working with explosives) together with a radar unit for avalanche detection, were installed in 2011, in order to protect one key section of this road, that is endangered by two ava-lanche paths. Additionally, in 2012 an infrasound array consisting of 5 sensors was installed in a forest close to the radar unit. Both detection systems are principally used for examining the effectiveness of explosions in case of poor visibility and at night, but also for information about spontaneous avalanche activity. Over the first two winters the radar detected avalanches very reliable. Preliminary results after the first winter with the infrasound array showed that medium and large sized avalanches could be detected and located by the array. Furthermore this project showed, that the combination of <b>controlled</b> avalanche <b>release</b> with detection tools, could significantly minimize avalanche risk...|$|R
50|$|In mid-2004, Selenium <b>Remote</b> <b>Control</b> (RC) was <b>released</b> as open source, {{and used}} a Comet {{technique}} in the browser to pick up requests from a commanding remote process (tests written in Java, Python, C# or Ruby).

If there were no further command yet it would wait until there was one before replying. This was as close as the Selenium-RC team got to turning the browser into a socket listener. Selenium2 (WebDriver) implemented a true socket listener for each browser, so the Comet code and technique isn't used any more.|$|R

40|$|When superparamagnetic {{nanoparticles}} {{are loaded}} within micro-carriers of thermosensitive and injectable biopolymers, “smart” microdevices are obtained: {{they respond to}} an external magnetic ﬁeld (EMF) through the release of any co-encapsulated molecules with a <b>remote</b> on-off <b>control.</b> Creating reliable and effective fabrication technologies {{for the production of}} these smart nano/micro-devices remains a challenge. In this work Supercritical Emulsion Extraction technology (SEE) is proposed for the fabrication of microcapsules with a core of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) or poly-lactic acid (PLA) covered by carboxybetaine-functionalized chitosan (f-chi) and loaded with paramagnetic nanoparticles (MAG, mean size of 6. 5 ± 3. 0 nm) and water soluble fluorescein (Fluo). Fluo is co-encaspulated as a fluorescent marker for the release study. Microcarriers showed a mean size of 800 ± 60 nm with an encapsulation efficiency of up to 90 %. The inversion of surface charge, after the f-chitosan coating, suggested the presence of a uniform functionalized surface available for further chemical linkage. The external chitosan layer had a thickness of 200 ± 50 nm. An excellent MAG dispersion was confirmed within the biopolymer matrix that was shown to be responsive to EMF; indeed, Fluo was released over 3 or 5 days from PLGA or f-chiPLGA microdevices into PBS medium at 37 °C; whereas, <b>remote</b> on-off <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> was achieved when an Alternating Magnetic Field (AMF) was applie...|$|R

ERTL released die-cast toys of KITT in three different sizes — the common miniature sized model, a 'medium' sized model, and a large sized model. These toys featured red reflective holograms on the nose to represent the scanner.

50|$|The {{need for}} {{underwater}} acoustic telemetry exists in {{applications such as}} data harvesting for environmental monitoring, communication with and between manned and unmanned underwater vehicles, transmission of diver speech, etc. A related application is underwater <b>remote</b> <b>control,</b> in which acoustic telemetry is used to remotely actuate a switch or trigger an event. A prominent example of underwater <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> are acoustic <b>releases,</b> devices {{that are used to}} return sea floor deployed instrument packages or other payloads to the surface per remote command {{at the end of a}} deployment. Acoustic communications form an active field of research with significant challenges to overcome, especially in horizontal, shallow-water channels. Compared with radio telecommunications, the available bandwidth is reduced by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, the low speed of sound causes multipath propagation to stretch over time delay intervals of tens or hundreds of milliseconds, as well as significant Doppler shifts and spreading. Often acoustic communication systems are not limited by noise, but by reverberation and time variability beyond the capability of receiver algorithms. The fidelity of underwater communication links can be greatly improved by the use of hydrophone arrays, which allow processing techniques such as adaptive beamforming and diversity combining.|$|R
40|$|Two {{slightly}} cross-linked hydrogels bearing l-phenylalanine (Phe-Nip 3) or l-valine (Ava 2) residues of a copolymeric and homopolymeric vinyl structure {{were considered}} for their potential application in the psychiatric treatment of depression. Two antidepressant drugs (citalopram and trazodone) were loaded into hydrogels and their <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> behavior monitored {{for several days}} at 25 °C in two buffer solutions of different pHs (PBS pH 7. 4 and acetate pH 4. 6). The different basicity constants (logKs) of the involved substance determine a different electrostatic effect between the drug ionized positively and the negatively charged hydrogel. Both the hydrogels loaded with citalopram showed a greater binding effect with respect to trazodone. In fact, for the same hydrogel, the release of citalopram in PBS (4 days) was slower than trazodone (24 h). In addition, at pH (4. 6) < logK {{the release of the}} drug was much slower and durable, due to the lower capacity of ionization and swelling of the hydrogel. Additionally, the magnetic nanoparticles (CoFe 2 O 4) embedded into the hydrogel Phe-Nip 3 were an additional <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> for drug <b>release</b> through the stimulation of an appropriate alternating magnetic field (AMF, 20 kHz and 50 W).
