5|$|The Catholic Church, whose {{traditional}} membership {{was most}} affected by the changes in housing, {{was the first to}} <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> situation, creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone. The Baptist and Episcopalian churches followed close behind, particularly in the new towns. Within the Church of Scotland, the closeness of congregation and clergy was expressed in the domestic plainness of 1950s dual-use hall churches, as at Reiach's Kildrum Parish Church, Cumbernauld (completed 1962), a steel framed building, clad in timber and brick with a flat roof. Of 129 buildings erected by the Church of Scotland between 1948 and 1959, 108 were on this basic pattern.|$|E
5|$|In 930, Melias's {{attack on}} Samosata was heavily defeated; among other {{prominent}} officers, {{one of his}} sons was captured and sent to Baghdad. Later in the same year, John and his brother Theophilos besieged Theodosiopolis (modern Erzurum), the capital of the emirate of Qaliqala. The campaign was complicated by the machinations of their ostensible allies, the Iberian rulers of Tao-Klarjeti. Resenting the extension of direct Byzantine control adjacent to their own borders, the Iberians had already provided supplies to the besieged city. Once the city was invested, they vociferously demanded that the Byzantines hand over several captured towns, but when one of them, the fort of Mastaton, was surrendered, the Iberians promptly returned it to the Arabs. As Kourkouas needed to keep the Iberians placated and was aware that his conduct was being carefully observed by the Armenian princes, he did not <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> affront. After seven months of siege, Theodosiopolis fell in spring 931 and was transformed into a tributary vassal, while, according to Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio, all territory north of the river Araxes was given to the Iberian king David II. As in Melitene, the maintenance of Byzantine control over Theodosiopolis proved difficult and the population remained restive. In 939, it revolted and drove out the Byzantines, and Theophilos Kourkouas could not finally subdue the city until 949. It was then fully incorporated into the Empire and its Muslim population was expelled and replaced by Greek and Armenian settlers.|$|E
25|$|MBO {{situations}} {{lead management}} teams often into a dilemma as {{they face a}} conflict of interest, being interested in a low purchase price personally {{while at the same}} time being employed by the owners who obviously have an interest in a high purchase price. Owners usually <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> situation by offering a deal fee to the management team if a certain price threshold is reached. Financial sponsors usually <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> again by offering to compensate the management team for a lost deal fee if the purchase price is low. Another mechanisms to handle this problem are earn-outs (purchase price being contingent on reaching certain future profitabilities).|$|E

25|$|Now {{the city}} had to <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> revelation. Later the same year, the real {{property}} committee of the city forbade the disposal of waste oil and other hazardous waste materials at the dumping ground, but later, due to financial considerations, it had to allow {{the use of the}} site as the dumping ground of the Helsinki City Gas Works. The gas works was given special permission to continue to take its waste to the dumping ground, provided that it first neutralized the sulphuric acid waste with calcium oxide.|$|E
25|$|William VI did not {{immediately}} <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> setback; he had other things on his mind, being {{at war with the}} Duke of Guelders as he was, and receiving messages of the raids his Hoek enemy William, Lord of Arkel was making on his territories all the time. So in June 1411 he made a truce with the Frisians, which was renewed in the following month. When he began organising a campaign for the middle of August, the Frisians became somewhat more accommodating, and a three-year truce could be negotiated, and the campaign was called off. Under the terms of this truce Hollandic merchants got access to coastal towns and villages in Oostergo and Westergo from Dokkum in the northeast all the way around to Lemmer in the southeast; the Vetkoper refugees were allowed to return home; and William VI was awarded a large sum of money.|$|E

500|$|The 22nd did {{not stay}} long at Halls Hill. With the Army of the Potomac in disarray and the Confederates on the offensive, {{an attack on}} Washington was {{expected}} at any moment. The 22nd was shifted to several different defensive entrenchments outside of Arlington, Virginia {{during the first week}} of September. [...] Lee, however, set out to invade Western Maryland, the lead elements of his army crossing the Potomac on September 4, 1862. [...] McClellan was slow to <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> development, but began moving elements of the Army of the Potomac northwest from Washington on September 6. On September 10, Lieutenant Colonel Tilton, having been released from Libby Prison through an officer exchange, returned to the 22nd and took command. The 22nd left Arlington on September 12. The march through Maryland was remembered by the 22nd as wearisome and profoundly dusty.|$|E
500|$|Another Michigan {{writer from}} SB Nation {{described}} {{the film as}} thorough {{in its ability to}} provide the viewer with the answers to natural intrigues such as: [...] "How was the recruiting class assembled? Who pushed for the baggy shorts? The black socks? How did a stodgy University of Michigan culture <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> bold, brash and outspoken team?" [...] Other columnists were also satisfied to learn that Rose came up with the shorts and Jackson came up with the socks. He also commended the film on its detail surrounding Chris Webber's infamous timeout in the 1993 NCAA championship. The same reviewer enumerated his five biggest omissions from the film: Michigan athletic director Bill Martin, 1991–92 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team, 1992–93 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team, Michael Talley and Webber. He was also critical of Mitch Albom's involvement with the Fab Five.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of new towns and council house estates necessitated the rapid supply of new churches. The austerity, shortage of materials and need for rapid building, discouraged the development of innovative design. This was accompanied by the rejection by most architects of traditional forms in favour of [...] "international modernism", characterised by simple outlines, uncluttered internal spaces, absence of colour, and flat roofs. The Catholic Church, whose traditional membership was most affected by the changes in housing, {{was the first to}} <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> situation, creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone.

500|$|The game's NPCs feature {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) systems that detect unscripted visual and aural cues. If an NPC sees or hears {{something out of}} place, it will <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> depending {{on the level of}} its suspicions; if for a brief second, they will simply ignore it, but if for long enough, they will become alert to their surroundings and begin searching the area. NPCs will react to things such as clashing swords or the reaction in other NPCs' voices, as well as to visual changes to their environment, such as blood stains, opened doors and fallen bodies; players can avoid leaving visual clues by cleaning them up, such as hiding bodies. NPCs are divided between three categories - [...] "guards", [...] "servants", and [...] "non-human" [...] - whose reactions vary; guards will call out an alert if they spot the player and attack them; servants will run for help if they spot the player or a body; non-human NPCs will merely pursue and attack the player. [...] If a guard is significantly injured, he will try to escape and find help; some non-human NPCs will merely flee. Non-human characters range from giant spiders, feral creatures, to zombies and ghosts, with certain levels containing survival horror elements.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
500|$|... "Meat" [...] {{was made}} {{alongside}} [...] "Sleeper", the second {{episode of the}} series which was also directed by Teague, as part of block two of production which ran from 3 June to 5 July 2007. It originally had the working title [...] "Another Working Day". In discussing {{the origins of the}} central alien writer Catherine Tregenna states that [...] "we were just throwing ideas around and true to form Russell [...] said [...] "why isn't it just a great big whale in a warehouse?"" [...] Davies states the alien was designed to be [...] "one of Torchwood and Doctor Whos biggest monsters" [...] not in terms of concept but its [...] "literal size". He felt this provided insight into [...] "the strangeness of life". Producer Richard Stokes states that the concept design team created an idea of what they envisaged the whale to look like. Tregenna felt that the original design for the creature was [...] "a little fanciful" [...] in that it was a bit too [...] "beautiful and exotic" [...] before deciding [...] "if it looked like that they [...] would exhibit it, it would be a freak show." [...] She characterises the final design as resembling [...] "a giant kebab". Contrary to observations from commentators, Tregenna did not intend the story to promote vegetarianism as she is not a vegetarian— she simply wanted to write an episode that was more action based than her series one episodes ("Out of Time" [...] and [...] "Captain Jack Harkness"). The hypothetical size of the space whale resulted in Teague having to find this [...] "huge great warehouse" [...] and hire a fifty-foot crane for camera angles. Whilst {{the main body of the}} alien was created using computer-generated imagery a prosthetic version of the cut wound in the side of the alien was available for the actors to interact with on set. Actor Eve Myles describes it as being like filming within a [...] "blood soaked, soppy big sponge". The opening of the creature's eye was created using green screen.

2500|$|Hooker's army faced Lee {{across the}} Rappahannock from its winter {{quarters}} in Falmouth and around Fredericksburg. Hooker developed {{a strategy that}} was, on paper, superior to those of his predecessors. He planned to send his 10,000 cavalrymen under Maj. Gen. George Stoneman to cross the Rappahannock far upstream and raid deep into the Confederate rear areas, destroying crucial supply depots along the railroad from the Confederate capital in Richmond to Fredericksburg, which would cut Lee's lines of communication and supply. Hooker reasoned that Lee would <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> threat by abandoning his fortified positions on the Rappahannock and withdrawing toward his capital. At that time, Hooker's infantry would cross the Rappahannock in pursuit, attacking Lee when he was moving and vulnerable. Stoneman attempted to execute this turning movement on April 13, but heavy rains made the river crossing site at Sulphur Spring impassable.
