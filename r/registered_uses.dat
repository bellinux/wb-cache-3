40|$|Register {{is a set}} of {{language}} items associated with discrete occupational or social groups. The writer investigated the <b>register</b> <b>used</b> by flight attendant in Lion Air. This study aims to obtain the information about <b>register</b> <b>used</b> by flight attendant, the meaning of registers and the reason of <b>using</b> <b>registers</b> by flight attendant in Lion Air. This study used descriptive qualitative research design to find out a phenomena about the <b>register</b> <b>used</b> by flight attendant in Lion Air. The informants of this study were four flight attendants in Lion Air. One of flight attendants is senior who has worked for three years. The other informants are junior flight attendants. In collecting the data, the instruments of this study were document analysis and interview. The study showed that there were 82 <b>registers</b> <b>used</b> by flight attendant in Lion Air. First, there were 6 of 82 <b>registers</b> <b>used</b> to call the name of flight crew. Second, there were 9 of 82 <b>registers</b> <b>used</b> to call the term of passengers. Third, there were 19 of 83 <b>registers</b> <b>used</b> to express the code to others crew. Fourth, there were 12 of 82 <b>registers</b> <b>used</b> to call the name of devices in the aircraft. Fifth, based on the senior flight attendant explanation, there were 5 jargons that become registers. Sixth, there were 36 of 82 <b>registers</b> by <b>using</b> abbreviation that has function as the name of organization, code to do report and something urgent, the name of documents, the name of safety equipment’s, and addressee to the flight crew and passengers.

5000|$|The use of {{flumequine}} in food {{animals had}} sparked considerable debate. Significant and harmful residues of quinolones {{have been found}} in animals treated with quinolones and later slaughtered and sold as food products. There has been significant concern regarding the amount of flumequine residue found within food animals such as fish, poultry and cattle. [...] In 2003 the Joint FAO/WHO Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) withdrew the maximum residue limits (MRLs) for flumequine and carbadox based on evidence showing both are direct acting genotoxic carcinogens, therefore the Committee was unable to establish an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for human exposure to such residues. Subsequently, in 2006, the JEFCA, re-established the ADI having received appropriate evidence and MRLs were re-specified. The role of JECFA is to evaluate toxicology, residue chemistry and related information and make recommendations for acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels and maximum residue limits (MRLs). At its 16th session, held May 2006, the Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods (CCRVDF) requested information on <b>registered</b> <b>uses</b> of flumequine. As the CCRVDF did not receive any information regarding the <b>registered</b> <b>uses</b> of flumequine that they had requested, the committee members agreed to discontinue work on the MRLs for flumequine in shrimp.|$|E
50|$|Chlorfenvinphos {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the United States in 1963, by the Shell International Chemical Company Ltd., Ciba AG (now Ciba-Geigy AG) and by Allied Chemical Corporation. Its main use was as an insecticide and acaricide used to control insect pests on livestock and household pests such as flies, fleas, and mites. Since its first application, many manufacturers included chlorfenvinphos in their products. Some common trade names are Birlane®, Dermaton®, Sapercon®, Steladone®, and Supona®. Since 1991, however, information on current production of chlorfenvinphos has been conflicting. One source lists base producers of the compound as the American Cyanamid Company. However, no producers of chlorfenvinphos were identified in a 1993 Directory of Chemical Producers for the United States of America. Moreover, {{there have been no}} <b>registered</b> <b>uses</b> for this compound as a pesticide in the United States since 1995.|$|E

As EPA receives draft Biological Opinions relative to these consultations, they will be posted to www. epa. gov/espp and included in a public docket EPA-HQ-OPP- 2008 - 0654 so EPA may receive public input on any changes to a pesticide’s registration recommended by the National Marine Fisheries Service. BACKGROUND The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires that Federal Agencies assess their “actions ” to determine whether species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA, may be affected by those actions, or whether critical habitat may be adversely modified. The <b>registered</b> <b>uses</b> of a pesticide constitute an EPA "action " under the ESA.

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} insecticides {{are abundant}} and varied in their effects, though {{but a few}} are articles of commerce. Even for these, pyrethrum, nicotine, rotenone, hellebore, ryania, and sabadilla, there is a paucity of information on mammalian toxicology and environmental effects. In general, these materials are characterized favorably by low acute toxicity and ready dissipation in nature. Unfavorable aspects of natural insecticides are the contained mixture of active and inactive components and the low active ingredient content on a crop yield basis pointing to a high unit cost. Natural insecticides can serve additionally as leads to unnatural mimics, of which the commercially successful synthetic pyrethroids are prime examples. The chemical nature, relationship of insecticidal activity to chemical structure, occurrence, production, and utilization, <b>registered</b> <b>uses,</b> metabolism, and insect and mammalian toxicity are reviewed...|$|E

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} principles introduced by REACH is that it is for manufacturers, importers and downstream users to ensure that manufacturing, placing on the market or use of chemicals does not adversely affect human health or the environment (Art. 1 (3)). Companies need to register the chemicals they manufacture or import with a yearly volume exceeding 1 ton. In addition to that the safe use for the whole life-cycle of a substance needs to be demonstrated in a chemical safety report (CSR) as important part of the registration for substances with a yearly volume exceeding 10 tons. If risks are identified in the CSR, the responsible registrants need to propose and apply appropriate measures to adequately control the risks. These measures also need to be recommended to downstream users in the (extended) safety data sheet (Art. 14 (6)). The safety data sheet is also the instrument to communicate <b>registered</b> <b>uses,</b> hazards, risks and appropriate risk management measures within the supply chain.|$|E
40|$|The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) was amended in 1988 to {{accelerate}} the reregistration of products with active ingredients registered prior to November 1, 1984. The amended Act called for the development and submission of data to support the reregistration of an active ingredient, {{as well as a}} review of all submitted data by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (referred to as EPA or the Agency) to assess the current tolerances. Reregistration involves a thorough review of the scientific database underlying a pesticide’s registration. The purpose of the Agency’s review is to reassess the potential hazards arising from the currently <b>registered</b> <b>uses</b> of the pesticide; to determine the need for additional data on health and environmental effects; and, {{to determine whether or not}} the pesticide meets the “no unreasonable adverse effects ” criteria of FIFRA. On August 3, 1996, the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) was signed into law. FQPA amends FIFRA to require tolerance reassessment during reregistration. In addition, FQPA requires that all active ingredients first registered after 1984 would also be reevaluated to reassess their current tolerances, by 2006. FQPA also amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to require a safety finding in tolerance reassessment based on factors including an assessment of cumulative effects of chemicals with a common mechanism of toxicity...|$|E

40|$|There are six {{chemicals}} {{or groups}} of chemicals that are currently registered as avicides {{that can be used}} in some or all of the U. S. Most of these chemicals, because of their diverse chemical composition and innate toxicological effects, present somewhat different primary and secondary hazards to avian and mammalian predators and scavengers. Of the chemicals reviewed, all appear to present some degree of primary hazard to non-target birds and mammals; however, PA- 14, the Starlicide family of chemicals and fenthion appear to be the least hazardous when used according to use directions. 4 -Aminopyridine, endrin and strychnine, because of their high acute toxicity and lack of selectivity, must be considered potentially more hazardous. With respect to secondary hazards, the ranking of chemicals changes considerably and only PA- 14 appears to present a negligible hazard. The Starlicide family of chemicals presents negligible hazards to most animal species under currently <b>registered</b> <b>uses,</b> but may be potentially hazardous to cats and owls under specific use conditions. Two chemicals, 4 -aminopyridine and strychnine, are potentially more hazardous to predatory and scavenger animals due to their highly toxic nature and rapid lethal effects in target species, leaving unassimilated chemical in the gastrointestinal tract. The remaining chemicals, endrin and fenthion, have been shown to possess the potential for more significant secondary poisoning; however, because of restrictive uses, most of the potential hazards have been avoided in operational use...|$|E
40|$|A {{probabilistic}} {{estimation of}} the exposure of the Brazilian population to the dithiocarbamate pesticides was performed using the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment program (MCRA 3. 5). Residue data, as CS 2, for 3821 samples {{were obtained from the}} Brazilian national monitoring program on pesticide residues and from the monitoring program conducted in the Distrito Federal on rice, beans and nine fruits and vegetables. Food consumption data were obtained from a Brazilian household budget survey conducted between 2002 and 2003. Processing factors for washing, peeling or cooking were applied to the residues found in the crops. Daily intakes at the highest percentiles for the general population reached a maximum of 2. 0 μg CS 2 /kg body weight per day (upper band of the 95 % confidence interval at P 99. 99). Tomato, rice, apple and lettuce were the commodities which contributed most to the intake. Based on the <b>registered</b> <b>uses</b> and the toxicological profile of dithiocarbamates, the risk from exposure was evaluated assuming that all residues came from the use of ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate (EBDC) or that a fraction of it came from the use of propineb. For this last scenario, a cumulative risk assessment was conducted. In the first scenario, the highest intake reached up to 11. 9 % EBDC ADI for the general population and up to 31. 1 % ADI for children. When 30 % of the residues were considered as coming from propineb use, the values were 15. 2 % and 39. 7 % ADI, respectively...|$|E
