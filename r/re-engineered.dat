Some 70 engines were converted before priority was given to producing aero engines.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of European agricultural methods, the shores of San Francisco Bay consisted mostly of tidal marshes. Today, the bay has been significantly altered heavily <b>re-engineered</b> to accommodate the needs of water delivery, shipping, agriculture, and urban development, with side effects including the loss of wetlands and {{the introduction}} of contaminants and invasive species. Approximately 85% of those marshes have been lost or destroyed, but about 50 marshes and marsh fragments remain. Huge tracts of the marshes were originally destroyed by farmers for agricultural purposes, then repurposed to serve as salt evaporation ponds to produce salt for food and other purposes. Today, regulations limit the destruction of tidal marshes, and large portions are currently being rehabilitated to its natural state.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, City Council Member Eric Ulrich, a Republican {{representing}} Ozone Park, {{came out}} against the plan as among other things, it prohibited left turns at Jamaica Avenue. He had been in favor of bus rapid transit along Woodhaven Boulevard, as he stated in a 2014 opinion editorial. The plan was modified in May 2016 {{in an effort to}} accommodate Ulrich's objections. It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up travel times by eliminating the signal time allocated to split phasing—a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have a red light, in order to allow drivers at the green light to turn left without conflicts from oncoming traffic. The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left turns at Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be <b>re-engineered</b> around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease blind spots and collisions. Local community members were also opposed to the plan due to the reduction of traffic lanes along the boulevard's service roads from two lanes to a single lane.|$|E

5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} the machine, and <b>re-engineered</b> some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|E

Among the most important small tributary basins are the Maldonado, Vega, Medrano, Cildañez and White. In 1908 many of these tributaries were channelized as floods damaged the city's infrastructure. Beginning in 1919, most creeks were enclosed. Notably, the Maldonado was <b>re-engineered</b> in 1954 to flow underground in tubes and currently runs underneath Juan B. Justo Avenue.|$|E

The exterior was changed slightly, the Design Giugiaro badges being removed from the front fenders as a result.

Chrysler responded in 1979 when it <b>re-engineered</b> its intermediate B-body cars, and designated them the full-size R-bodies. However, these were not true downsized cars like GM and Ford introduced. 1977 models included a four-door sedan, two-door sedan, six-passenger two-seat station wagon and an eight-passenger three-seat station wagon. All models had window framed doors. No hardtop models were offered.|$|E
