40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} recent results of Micromorph {{thin film silicon}} tandem cells with n-doped silicon oxide based {{intermediate}} reflectors deposited in the KAI-M industrial PECVD reactor are discussed. From the optical analysis of the devices, specific features in the reflection spectrum attributed to the incorporated intermediate reflector can be observed. In particular, {{the influence of the}} Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO) layer roughness on the reflection spectrum of the cells is studied. Compared to commercial SnO 2, reflection losses are reduced and photocurrents are increased by using <b>rougher</b> <b>front</b> TCO-layers like LPCVD-ZnO which should lead to potentially higher efficiencies at same silicon absorber thicknesses. Micromorph tandem cells with intermediate reflector on ZnO leads to 10. 18 % efficiency after 1000 h of light-soaking, whereas 10. 35 % have been achieved on commercial SnO 2...|$|R

This symmetric configuration is readily comparable to the situation of a nanoparticle in a homogeneous medium, and there is a comparable experimental configuration where the nanoparticle is embedded into a <b>rough</b> <b>front</b> side layer of the device. The following simulations of nanoparticles at interfaces rely on full 3 D simulations as they are performed with the finite element method because Mie theory is not capable of taking substrates into account.|$|R
2500|$|The P-40 was {{generally}} superior to early Italian fighter types, {{such as the}} Fiat G.50 and the Macchi C.200. Its performance against the Macchi C.202 Folgore elicited varying opinions. Some observers consider the Macchi C.202 superior. Caldwell, who scored victories against them in his P-40, felt that the Folgore was superior to the P-40 and the Bf 109 except that its armament of only two or four machine guns was inadequate. Other observers considered the two equally matched or favored the Folgore in aerobatic performance, such as turning radius. Aviation historian Walter J. Boyne wrote that over Africa, the P-40 and the Folgore were [...] "equivalent".

40|$|High {{efficiency}} thin-film silicon {{solar cells}} require texturing {{of the front}} contacts for advanced light management. However, optically favorable textures may be challenging {{in terms of the}} electrical performance. Solar cells deposited on very <b>rough</b> <b>front</b> contacts show a reduced open-circuit voltage, Voc, as compared to flat TCOs. This contribution focuses on the impact of rough surfaces on the Voc in a-Si:H solar cells deposited on six different textured front TCOs. With various i-layer thicknesses from 100 to 400 nm the origin of the Voc loss is investigated. Based on our results we propose that the reduction of Voc in a-Si:H solar cells are mainly due to defective regions in the bulk material induced by very rough textures. It is also seen that enlarging the i-layer thickness can improve the Voc of solar cells when grown on very rough textures. By using variable illumination intensity measurements the existence of shunts could be evidenced...|$|R

Divided roughly by each function, power module such as an engine and pumps, working module such as front structures and hydraulic actuators, traveling module such as crawlers or wheels, operation module such as control levers and pedals. In this time, to gather and carry lots of objectives in scrap yard or somewhere, both a fork grapple and a loader bucket are equipped as a working module. And to carry the objectives quickly to destination, wheeled traveling system is equipped. As a result, we have produced a multi-functional handling machine which has double <b>front</b> <b>attachments</b> and wheels.

40|$|Tandem {{thin-film}} silicon {{solar cells}} consist of an amorphous silicon top cell and a microcrystalline silicon bottom cell which are stacked and connected in series. To match the photocurrents {{of the top}} cell and the bottom cell, a proper light management is essential. To this end, intermediate reflectors are applied between the top and the bottom solar cells. State-of-the-art single-layer intermediate reflectors are made of low refractive index materials but show poor spectral selectivity and cause parasitic reflection losses in the external quantum efficiency of the bottom cell. We report {{on the design of}} a multilayer intermediate reflector based on aluminum doped zinc oxide and microcrystalline silicon oxide with a spectrally selective reflectance. Rigorous optical simulations are used to examine the intermediate reflector even in textured thin-film solar cells. In a subsequent step, this intermediate reflector was successfully integrated into state-of-the art tandem solar cells deposited on a <b>rough</b> <b>front</b> contact.

We have studied the time taken for a <b>rough</b> growth <b>front</b> to recover {{in the absence of}} growth as a function of growth temperature for these compounds. It is found that while GaAs and InGaAs surfaces can recover in 15 â 20 s under ideal growth conditions, Al 0. 3 Ga 0. 7 As surfaces take â 45 s, and In 0. 52 Al 0. 48 As surfaces take several minutes to recover. Our results also suggest that smoothening of the growth front occurs by rearrangement of the surface atoms, rather than by reâevaporation. We have also studied the effect of strain induced by mismatch on growth modes in the case of InxGa 1 âxAs on GaAs.

40|$|The {{colonization}} of unoccupied territory by invading species, known as range expansion, is a spatially heterogeneous non-equilibrium growth process. We introduce a two-species Eden growth model {{to analyze the}} interplay between uni-directional (irreversible) mutations and selection at the expanding front. While the evolutionary dynamics leads to coalescence of both wild-type and mutant clusters, the non-homogeneous advance of the colony results in a <b>rough</b> <b>front.</b> We show that roughening and domain dynamics are strongly coupled, resulting in qualitatively altered bulk and front properties. For beneficial mutations the front is quickly taken over by mutants and growth proceeds Eden-like. In contrast, if mutants grow slower than wild-types, there is an antagonism between selection pressure against mutants and growth by merging of mutant domains with an ensuing absorbing state phase transition to an all-mutant front. We find that surface roughening has a marked effect on the critical properties of the absorbing state phase transition. While reference models, which keep the expanding front flat, exhibit directed percolation critical behavior, the exponents of the two-species Eden model strongly deviate from it. In turn, the mutation-selection process induces an increased surface roughness with exponents distinct {{from that of the}} classical Eden model.

40|$|We {{investigate}} erosion patterns {{observed in}} a horizontal granular bed resulting from seepage of water motivated by observation of beach rills and channel growth in larger scale land forms. Our experimental apparatus consists of a wide rectangular box filled with glass beads with a narrow opening {{in one of the}} side walls from which eroded grains can exit. Quantitative data on the shape of the pattern and erosion dynamics are obtained with a laser-aided topography technique. We show that the spatial distribution of the source of groundwater can significantly impact the shape of observed patterns. An elongated channel is observed to grow upstream when groundwater is injected at a boundary adjacent to a reservoir held at constant height. An amphitheater (semicircular) shape is observed when uniform rainfall infiltrates the granular bed to maintain a water table. Bifurcations are observed as the channels grow in response to the groundwater. We further find that the channels grow by discrete avalanches as the height of the granular bed is increased above the capillary rise, causing the deeper channels to have <b>rougher</b> <b>fronts.</b> The spatiotemporal distribution of avalanches increase with bed height when partial saturation of the bed leads to cohesion between grains. However, the overall shape of the channels is observed to remain unaffected indicating that seepage erosion is robust to perturbation of the erosion front. United States.
