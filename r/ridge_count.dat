Since dermatoglyphs are unique for each person, by examining them a number of parameters can be determined. These parameters could help to diagnose and treat examined individulas. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine possible differences of the dermathoglyphic characteristics of digito-palmar complex (DPC) comparing the autistic boys with the healthy examinees. Methods. This study was conducted on a group of 182 boys with infantile autism, aged from 5 to 15 (average age 7. 2 years) while the control group consisted of 182 healthy men from 30 to 50 years (average age 38. 7 years). Within the digital scope of DPC we examined tree types of dermatoglyphic patterns on fingertips (arch, loop and whrol), as well as dermal <b>ridge</b> <b>count</b> on each finger separately (FRC - finger <b>ridge</b> <b>count)</b> and total dermal <b>ridge</b> <b>count</b> on all the ten fingers (TRC - total <b>ridge</b> <b>count).</b> Within the palmar DPC area we measured the angles between the triradius (atd, dat, adt, atb, btc, ctd), as well as dermal <b>ridge</b> <b>count</b> (RC - <b>ridge</b> <b>count)</b> between the triradius a-b, b-c and c-d. Results. The autistic boys had a significantely higher count of arches (9. 17 %) on fingertips of both hands when compared to the control group of examinees (4. 34 %), and the lower count of loops (28. 40 %) compared with the control group (32. 42 %). A higher count of arches was especially expressed on the fourth and fifth finger of both hands. Beside this characteristic, the autistic boys had a lower TRC and ab-RC as well as a wider atd angle.

Two sexually dimorphic components were extracted from measurements taken on 62 male and 68 female hands and forearms. These components were combined to create an objective hand masculinity index. Sex-typical scores on this objective measure were associated with sexually dimorphic facial features, greater symmetry, sex typical 2 D: 4 D (low for men and high for women) in Anglo participants and low finger <b>ridge</b> <b>counts</b> in both sexes. Attractiveness ratings and attribute judgments were made on photographs of the dorsal view of target hands and arms. Additional ratings of hands only and arms only were obtained for comparison. Subjectively rated and objectively measured masculine hands and arms were judged most attractive in men, while feminine hands and arms were preferred in women. Within men, an analysis of separate hand and arm ratings indicated that a combination of masculine hands with less masculine forearms was most attractive, possibly indicating a trade-off between quality and parental investment by the opposite sex. Men with male typical hand index scores, low 2 D: 4 D and high <b>ridge</b> <b>counts</b> were rated as more masculine, dominant, intelligent, healthy and as good parents.

Both univariate linkage to the absolute <b>ridge</b> <b>count</b> (a sum of all the ridge counts on all ten fingers), and multivariate linkage analyses of the counts on individual fingers, were conducted.

40|$|Background: The {{aetiology}} of NIDDM {{is believed}} to be as a consequence of genetic and environmental factors that impair metabolism. While little can be done on the genetic component, much can be done as a preventive measure in NIDDM. Because nothing much can be done prenatally, researchers have resorted to studying physical variables like dermatoglyphics (DGs). Dermatoglyphic patterns form on the finger pad and the palm prenatally and remain unchanged throughout life, thus these features may serve as markers for fetal origin of adult disease like NIDDM. Thus the concept of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) which has been defined as random differences between the right (R) and left (L) sides of a morphological trait has gained prominence in diseases like schizophrenia. When the distribution of R-L differences in a population sample approximates a normal curve with a mean approximately equal to zero, the variance of distributions of R-L difference is a measure of FA. Studies have shown that genetic factors may also have a link to FA in finger and a-b <b>ridge</b> <b>counts.</b> No studies have been reported on FA in NIDDM. FA derived from quantitative parameters in DGs of NIDDM may throw light on fetal origins of an adult disease. Hence this study has been undertaken. Aim: The present study aims at deriving FA from quantitative parameters in DGs of NIDDM compared to controls in the Bangalore based population. Materials and Methods: Bilateral rolled finger and palm prints of 150 NIDDM patients (Males - 75, Females - 75) were compared to 120 controls (Males - 60, females - 60) from Bangalore based population. FA measures derived from quantitative parameters (finger <b>ridge</b> <b>counts,</b> a-b <b>ridge</b> <b>counts,</b> main line index and palmar angles) were analysed. Results: Comparisons were made in all parameters between homologous fingers of both hands using Pearson&#x 2032;s product moment correlation coefficients (r). The difference in correlation coefficients between cases and controls was calculated using Fisher&#x 2032;s Z transformation. 1 -r 2 an estimate of error variance thus measures FA. FA measures were significantly higher in NIDDM males for the 5 th finger (FA= 2. 04) and for the palmar angle &#x 2032;dat&#x 2032; (FA= 2. 24); for the NIDDM female a high FA was found in the 2 nd finger (FA= 2. 17) compared to controls.
