The first leaf has two half-page miniatures. The upper illustration shows Mary with the Christ Child surrounded by clouds over a landscape. The lower illustration is of Christ speaking to a saint in a Franciscan habit in {{what appears to be the}} same landscape.

40|$|This research, which {{includes}} a thesis and a documentary film, focuses {{on the construction of}} a historical non-fiction film on anti-apartheid student protests at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg from 1957 to 1987. The restrictive censorship legislation at the time hampered the local distribution <b>of</b> the <b>recorded</b> footage and affected news reports on the nature of protests and protesters. The project sets out to situate these events within aspects of the historical and political context of the country, university, existing archive, individual and collective memory, the problematic of producing documentary films, the performative nature of protest action, the <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> <b>testimonies</b> and the production process. The research provides a framework for recording the interviews, collecting archival footage and photographs, and for constructing the narrative for the film. The thesis also considers the need for a “biographical” index for the construction process in order to rid the archive of subjective and political bias in an attempt to illuminate archiving processes such as the production of a historical documentary film. The project will show that although theoretical claims regarding the nature of truth in non-fiction filmmaking are fraught and open-ended, the collective memories of the participants, combined with relevant stock footage, can become a respectful collusion of voices...|$|R

25|$|The Roman Catholic Church in Poland {{provided}} many persecuted Jews {{with food}} and shelter during the war, even though monasteries gave no immunity to Polish priests and monks against the death penalty. Nearly every Catholic institution in Poland looked after a few Jews, usually children with forged Christian birth certificates and an assumed or vague identity. In particular, convents of Catholic nuns in Poland (see Sister Bertranda), {{played a major role}} in the effort to rescue and shelter Polish Jews, with the Franciscan Sisters credited with the largest number of Jewish children saved. Two thirds of all nunneries in Poland took part in the rescue, in all likelihood with the support and encouragement of the church hierarchy. These efforts were supported by local Polish bishops and the Vatican itself. The convent leaders never disclosed the exact number of children saved in their institutions, and for security reasons the rescued children were never registered. Jewish institutions have no statistics that could clarify the matter. Systematic <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> <b>testimonies</b> did not begin until the early 1970s. In the villages of Ożarów, Ignaców, Szymanów, and Grodzisko near Leżajsk, the Jewish children were cared for by Catholic convents and by the surrounding communities. In these villages, Christian parents did not remove their children from schools where Jewish children were in attendance.|$|R
