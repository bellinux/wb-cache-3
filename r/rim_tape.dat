A separate airtight inner tube enclosed by the rim supports the tire carcass and maintains the bead lock. If the inner part of the rim where the inner tube fits has spoke holes, they must be covered by a <b>rim</b> <b>tape</b> or strip, usually rubber, cloth, or tough plastic, to protect the inner tube.|$|E
