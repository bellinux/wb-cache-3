5|$|By September 1943, Neddermeyer's {{team had}} grown from five people to fifty. That month, John von Neumann came to Los Alamos at Oppenheimer's request. Von Neumann was {{impressed}} by the implosion concept and, working with Edward Teller, an old friend, made a series of suggestions. Von Neumann was able to create a sound mathematical model of implosion, enabling Neddermeyer to present a proposal for a greatly expanded <b>research</b> <b>program.</b> Edwin McMillan and Isidor Isaac Rabi recommended that George Kistiakowsky, who had a specialized knowledge in the precision use of explosives, be brought in to help the program.

5|$|Compton {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} X-rays on the sodium and chlorine nuclei in salt. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding {{that it was a}} result of the alignment of electron spins. In 1926, he became a consultant for the Lamp Department at General Electric. In 1934, he returned to England as Eastman visiting professor at Oxford University. While there General Electric asked him to report on activities at General Electric Company plc's research laboratory at Wembley. Compton was intrigued by the possibilities of the research there into fluorescent lamps. His report prompted a <b>research</b> <b>program</b> in America that developed it.|$|E

As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a <b>research</b> <b>program</b> for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E

He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.|$|E

However, due to the distinctive look and large size of the whale, watching is increasingly popular.

Popular locations for sperm whale watching include the town of Kaikoura on New Zealand's South Island, Andenes and Tromsø in Arctic Norway; as well as the Azores, where the continental shelf is so narrow that whales can be observed from the shore, and Dominica where a long-term scientific <b>research</b> <b>program,</b> The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, has been in operation since 2005.|$|E
