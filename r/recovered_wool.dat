25|$|Wool {{comes from}} domesticated sheep. It forms two products, woolens and worsteds. The sheep has two sorts of wool {{and it is}} the inner coat that is used. This can be mixed with wool that has been {{recovered}} from rags. Shoddy is the term for <b>recovered</b> <b>wool</b> that is not matted, while mungo comes from felted wool. Extract is recovered chemically from mixed cotton/wool fabrics.|$|E
40|$|The {{length of}} time that {{poliovirus}} could be <b>recovered</b> from <b>wool</b> gabardine and blanket, and from cotton sheeting, terry cloth, and knit jersey fabrics was determined under conditions of controlled temperature and humidity (25 C in 35 and 78 % relative humidities). Three types of exposure of the fabrics to viruses were used: direct contact, aerosol, and virus-containing household dust having a high content of textile fibers. When held in 35 % relative humidity, virus persisted for 20 weeks on wool fabrics, but only 1 to 4 weeks on cotton fabrics. At this relative humidity, virus titers on wool fabrics decreased rapidly to low but detectable levels which persisted {{for long periods of}} time, whereas in 78 % relative humidity the decrease in virus titer was less rapid, but the period of viral persistence was shorter. Generally, virus titers on cotton fabrics held in both relative humidities decreased exponentially to an undetectable level. The method of exposure to virus had a definite effect on the duration of viral persistence on a given fabric. Virus contained in household dust was least stable...|$|R
40|$|The {{persistence}} of Staphylococcus aureus (Smith) on wool blanket, wool gabardine, cotton sheeting, cotton knit jersey, cotton terry cloth, and cotton wash-and-wear fabrics was studied. The fabrics {{were exposed to}} bacterial populations by three methods: direct contact, aerosol, and a lyophilized mixture of bacteria and dust having a high content of textile fibers. The contaminated fabrics were held in 35 or 78 % relative humidities at 25 C. In general, the persistence time of S. aureus populations on fabrics held in 35 % relative humidity was substantially longer when the fabrics were contaminated by exposure to aerosolized cultures or to dust containing bacteria than when contaminated by direct contact. In a 78 % relative humidity, bacterial populations on the fabrics persisted for substantially shorter periods of time regardless of the mode of contamination or fabric type. Cotton wash-and-wear fabric (treated with a modified triazone resin) was the material on which populations of S. aureus persisted for the shortest time. This organism retained its virulence for Swiss mice after being <b>recovered</b> from <b>wool</b> gabardine swatches held 4 weeks in 35 % relative humidity and 6 weeks in 78 % relative humidity...|$|R
40|$|The {{persistence}} of Salmonella typhimurium (V- 31) on wool blanket, wool gabardine, cotton sheeting, cotton knit jersey, cotton terry cloth, and cotton wash-and-wear fabrics was studied. Three methods of exposure {{were employed to}} contaminate the fabrics: direct contact, aerosol, and a lyophilized mixture of bacteria and dust having a high content of textile fibers. After contamination, the fabrics were held in 35 or 78 % relative humidity at 25 C. The persistence time of S. typhimurium on fabrics held in 35 % relative humidity was substantially longer when the fabrics were contaminated by direct contact or by exposure to dust containing bacteria than when contaminated by exposure to aerosolized cultures. Viable bacterial populations persisted for 24 weeks at relatively high population densities on swatches of wool gabardine, cotton sheeting, cotton knit jersey, and cotton terry cloth exposed by direct contact and held in a humidity of 35 %. In 78 % humidity, bacterial populations persisted on the fabrics for relatively shorter periods of time regardless of the mode of contamination or fabric type. This organism retained its virulence for Swiss mice after being <b>recovered</b> from <b>wool</b> gabardine swatches held 8 weeks in humidities of 35 or 78 % and from cotton terry cloth swatches held 6 weeks in the same humidities...|$|R
