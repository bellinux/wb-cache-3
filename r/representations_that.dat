5|$|As a {{cultural}} critic, Said {{is known for}} the book Orientalism (1978), {{a critique of the}} cultural <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> are the bases of Orientalism—how the Western world perceives the Orient. Said’s model of textual analysis transformed the academic discourse of researchers in literary theory, literary criticism, and Middle-Eastern studies—how academics examine, describe, and define the cultures being studied. As a foundational text, Orientalism was controversial among the scholars of Oriental Studies, philosophy, and literature.|$|E
5|$|Defences to tracing are possible, {{particularly}} if returning the property would harm an innocent defendant, where the claimant has made false <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> the defendant relied {{on to his}} detriment, or where the property has been transferred to an innocent third party without anything given to the defendant in return that the claimant could recover in lieu.|$|E

One such algorithm uses the Lipschitz condition {{to create an}} octree <b>representation</b> <b>that</b> accelerates volume rendering.

5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{representations}} of 1 also occur in non-integer bases. For example, {{in the golden}} ratio base, the two standard representations are 1.000... and 0.101010..., and there are infinitely many more <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> include adjacent 1s. Generally, for almost all q between 1 and 2, there are uncountably many base-q expansions of 1. On the other hand, there are still uncountably many q (including all natural numbers greater than 1) {{for which there is}} only one base-q expansion of 1, other than the trivial 1.000.... This result was first obtained by Paul Erdős, Miklos Horváth, and István Joó around 1990. In 1998 Vilmos Komornik and Paola Loreti determined the smallest such base, the Komornik–Loreti constant q = 1.787231650.... In this base, 1 = 0.11010011001011010010110011010011...; the digits are given by the Thue–Morse sequence, which does not repeat.|$|E

However, for the representation of multipath wireless channel outputs, we consider windows that are adapted to the Doppler frequencies of the channel.|$|R

25|$|Another {{question}} is whether language is a tool for representing and referring to objects in the world, {{or whether it is}} a system used to construct mental <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> can be communicated.|$|E

25|$|Worcestershire County Council, the Police and {{particularly}} the County Surveyor of Worcestershire made repeated <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> a dual 3-lane standard motorway was appropriate, however the Ministry of Transport insisted that a dual 2-lane motorway would be built {{at a cost of}} around £8 million.

25|$|If G is {{a finite}} group and k a field with {{characteristic}} 0, then one {{shows in the}} theory of group <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> any subrepresentation of a given one is already a direct summand of the given one. Translated into module language, this means that all modules over the group algebra kG are injective. If the characteristic of k is not zero, the following example may help.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge-representation is {{the field}} of {{artificial}} intelligence that focuses on designing computer <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> capture information about the world {{that can be used}} to solve complex problems. The justification for knowledge representation is that conventional procedural code is not the best formalism to use to solve complex problems. Knowledge representation makes complex software easier to define and maintain than procedural code and can be used in expert systems.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} classes of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras whose {{representations}} have been studied. Among these, an important class are the Kac–Moody algebras. They are named after Victor Kac and Robert Moody, who independently discovered them. These algebras form a generalization of finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebras, and share {{many of their}} combinatorial properties. This means {{that they have a}} class of <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> can be understood {{in the same way as}} representations of semisimple Lie algebras.|$|E
25|$|The Director of the Serious Fraud Office {{has decided}} to {{discontinue}} {{the investigation into the}} affairs of BAE Systems plc as far as they relate to the Al Yamamah defence contract. This decision has been taken following <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> have been made both to the Attorney General and the Director concerning the need to safeguard national and international security. It has been necessary to balance the need to maintain the rule of law against the wider public interest. No weight has been given to commercial interests or to the national economic interest.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} the group show is a major scandal. Even though the {{pictures}} shown are still conventional <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> generally observe the rules of classical perspective (according to Gleizes), the public is outraged by the representation of subject matter as cones, cubes and spheres, resulting in the obscurity of the subject matter. The predominance of sharp geometrical faceting {{and the fact that}} a group of artists are all working in similar directions, gives rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although this and similar terms have been used before in artistic circles (usually in relation to the works of Metzinger, Delaunay and Braque), {{this is the first time}} the use of the term becomes widespread.|$|E
