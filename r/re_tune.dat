5000|$|Simultaneously, she {{recorded}} many {{songs as}} a pop singer, with album releases. Chinai was noted for her 1995 hit single and album, titled Made in India, which was composed by Biddu. Made in India {{went on to}} become one of the highest selling pop albums of its time and Alisha became a household name. This album contains well-known songs like, [...] "Aaja Mere Dil Mein", [...] "Ek Baar Do Baar", [...] "Sun O Meri Dhadkan", [...] "Tu Kahan", [...] "Ooh La La", [...] "Tu Jo Mila", [...] "Dhokha Diya Hai <b>Re</b> <b>Tune</b> Mere Dil" [...] and [...] "Lover Girl". With its success, Alisha announced her departure from playback singing and wanted to concentrate only on private pop albums. However, her follow-up albums were less successful. This was also the period when she got into a major controversy with the man who recorded several hit songs with her, Anu Malik. During the release of Made in India, Alisha had accused Anu Malik of molesting her. While some claim it was a publicity stunt by the singer to promote her album, Anu Malik and Alisha did not work for several years, only to reunite in 2003 with Ishq Vishk.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} generic AQM (Active Queue Management) control {{methodology}} in TCP/IP networks, based on fuzzy logic control. A simple, {{effective and efficient}} nonlinear control law is built, using a linguistic model of the system, rather than a traditional mathematical model, which is easily adapted in different network environments (e. g. Best-Effort and Differentiated-Services architectures). We demonstrate, via extensive simulative evaluation, that the proposed fuzzy control methodology offers inherent robustness with effective control of the system under widely differing operating conditions, without the need to (<b>re)</b> <b>tune</b> the settings for two different architectures (Best-Effort and Differentiated-Services). As demonstrated, this is {{in contrast with the}} well-known conventional counterparts of A-RED, REM, PI, AVQ for Best-Effort, and two-level PI, RIO for Diff-Serv based networks, where the proposed approach outperforms all tested counterparts in each different architecture...|$|E

It follows the [...] "Fluidic Sculpture" [...] design philosophy with slightly <b>re</b> <b>tuned</b> engines. A new next generation model, known as Elite i20 in India, was launched in India on August 11, 2014, and was launched in Europe in the 2014 Paris Motor Show.|$|R

Was known for the starter clutch to engage while riding locking up the engine, this was modified under warranty. The Exhaust Coupler Tube System (ECTS) link between the exhaust pipes disappeared in some markets outside of North America. The North America area kept the exhaust coupler tubes and older engine tune {{through to the end}} of production. This MY sales were 14,000+.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{iterative}} schemes {{of identification}} and control {{one of the}} particular and important choices to make is the choice for a model uncertainty structure, capturing the uncertainty concerning the estimated plant model. This is typically done in some norm-bounded form, in order to guarantee robust stability and/or robust performance when redesigning the controller. Structures {{that are used in}} the recent literature encompass e. g. gap metric uncertainty, coprime factor uncertainty, and the Vinnicombe gap metric uncertainty. In this paper we study the effect of these choices when our aim is to maximize the (<b>re)</b> <b>tuning</b> freedom for a present controller (in terms of a norm-bounded perturbation) under conditions of robust stability. Particular attention will be given to the representation of plant uncertainty and controller tuning freedom in terms of Youla parameters. In the problem formulation considered here the so-called double Youla parametrization provides a norm-bounded set of robustly stabilizing controllers that is larger than corresponding sets that are achieved by using any of the other uncertainty structures...|$|R
