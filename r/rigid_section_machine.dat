Mazda introduced with the convertible the first integral windblocker, a rigid panel that folded up from behind the passenger seats to block unwanted drafts from reaching the passengers — thereby extending the driving season for the car in open mode. The convertible also featured optional headrest mounted audio speakers and a folding leather snap-fastened tonneau cover. The convertible assembly was precisely engineered and manufactured, and dropped into the ready body assembly as a complete unit — a first in convertible production.|$|R

A typical open-loop impedance pump consists of an elastic tube, connected to rigid tubing, where the <b>rigid</b> <b>section</b> is connected to a reservoir.

30|$|Impedance pump {{is a type}} of valveless pump {{which does}} not require vanes or blades to operate.

A typical open-loop impedance pump consists of an elastic tube, connected to rigid tubing, where the <b>rigid</b> <b>section</b> is connected to a reservoir. Excitation at a single location (not in the middle) of the fluid-filled elastic tube will result in unidirectional flow. This is due to the mismatch in impedance in the elastic tube. Such pumping mechanism has shown to be highly sensitive towards the impedance in the tube, the location, and excitation frequency (Avrahami and Gharib 2008; Lee et al. 2015; Manopoulus et al. 2006; Hickerson 2005; Timmermann and Ottesen 2009).|$|R
