5|$|Adults who {{do believe}} that zero is even can {{nevertheless}} be unfamiliar with thinking of it as even, enough so to measurably slow them down in a <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, {{a pioneer in the}} field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number word is flashed to the subject on a monitor, and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number as odd or even. The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other even numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time—a small difference but a significant one.|$|E

At 1 Hz, <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> were faster for first-order compared with second-order motion.

5|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, amphetamine causes {{emotional and}} cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as decreased <b>reaction</b> <b>time,</b> fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Drug addiction {{is a serious}} risk with large recreational doses but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{measured}} <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> {{for detecting}} motion onset for sinusoidal gratings whose contrast was modulated in either luminance or chromaticity, for various drift rates and contrasts. In general, <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> to chromatic gratings were slower than to luminance gratings of matched cone contrast, {{but the difference}} in response depended critically on both contrast and speed. At high image speeds there was virtually no difference, whereas at low speeds, the difference was pronounced, especially at low contrasts. At high image speeds there was little dependence of <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> on contrast (for either luminance or colour), whereas at low speeds the dependence was greater, particularly for chromatic stimuli. This pattern of results is reminiscent of those found for apparent speed of drifting luminance and chromatic gratings. We verified the effects of contrast on perceived speed, {{and went on to}} show that the effects of contrast on <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> are totally predictable by the perceived speed of the stimuli, as if it were perceived rather than physical speed that determined <b>reaction</b> <b>times.</b> Our results support the idea of separate systems for fast and slow motion (with separate channels for luminance and colour at slower speeds), and further suggest that apparent speed and <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> may be determined at a similar stage of motion analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} chronic, daily {{administration}} of cocaine on auditory and visual <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> and thresholds were studied in baboons. Single intramuscular injections of cocaine hydrochloride (0. 1 to 5. 6 mg/kg) were given once daily for periods of 10 to 25 days, and were followed immediately by psychophysical tests {{designed to assess}} cocaine's effects on simple <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> as on auditory and visual threshold functions. Consistent reductions in <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> were frequently observed over the cocaine dose range of 0. 32 to 1. 0 mg/kg; at higher doses, either decreases or increases in <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> were observed, depending upon the animal. Lowered <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> generally occurred immediately following the 1 st day's cocaine injection, and continued through all subsequent days during the dose administration period, suggesting little development of tolerance or sensitivity to these reaction-time effects. Reaction-time decreases showed a U-shaped dose-effect function. The greatest decreases in <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> occurred from 0. 32 to 1. 0 mg/kg, and produced an average reaction-time decrease of 10 to 12 %.

This gives Watson some {{advantages and disadvantages}} compared with human Jeopardy! players. Watson has deficiencies in understanding the contexts of the clues. As a result, human players usually generate responses faster than Watson, especially to short clues. Watson's programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response. Watson has consistently better <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> on the buzzer once it has generated a response, and is immune to human players' psychological tactics, such as jumping between categories on every clue.|$|E
5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased <b>reaction</b> <b>time,</b> fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and loss of appetite. The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E

Bolt's coach reported that, based upon the speed of Bolt's opening 60 m, he could have finished {{with a time of}} 9.52 s. After scientific analysis of Bolt's run by the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, Hans Eriksen and his colleagues also predicted a sub 9.60 s time.

5|$|R.C. Pro-Am II was {{developed}} by Rare and published by Tradewest. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in December1992. Nintendo Power praised the game's controls and upgrade options, which made the game strategic. The magazine criticized the difficulty as unfair, with aircraft hazards that gave players no <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> in which to dodge attacks. Nintendo Magazine System praised the game overall and its multiplayer in particular, but felt that better games were available. In 1993, GamePro said that the game was better than its predecessor, but noted that the graphics and sound could have been better. Jeuxvideo.com appreciated how the sequel's cars had better traction, but thought the game was technically unrefined considering its few advances in four years' time. For example, they criticized Rare for recycling the original game's audio. In 1994, Game Players had high praise for the game's multiplayer, screeching sound effects, vehicle handling, and replay value. They criticized its lack of in-game music and current weapon indicators, and struggled to anticipate turns in the track in the game's angled perspective.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} aspects of narcosis are the impairment of judgement, multi-tasking and coordination, {{and the loss}} of decision-making ability and focus. Other effects include vertigo and visual or auditory disturbances. The syndrome may cause exhilaration, giddiness, extreme anxiety, depression, or paranoia, depending on the individual diver and the diver's medical or personal history. When more serious, the diver may feel overconfident, disregarding normal safe diving practices. Slowed mental activity, as indicated by increased <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> and increased errors in cognitive function, are effects which increase the risk of a diver mismanaging an incident. Narcosis reduces both the perception of cold discomfort and shivering and thereby affects the production of body heat and consequently allows a faster drop in the core temperature in cold water, with reduced awareness of the developing problem.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{sought to}} {{quantify}} the temporal properties of the human visual system by measuring forced-choice <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> for discriminating the drift direction of first-order motion (luminance-modulated noise) {{and a variety of}} second-order motion patterns (modulations of either the contrast, polarity, orientation or spatial length of a noise carrier) over a range of stimulus modulation depths. In general, <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> for all types of second-order motion were slower than those for first-order motion. Specifically, <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> were similar for modulations of image contrast, polarity and orientation but were markedly slower for modulations of spatial length. There was also a tendency for <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> to decrease as stimulus modulation depth increased. The rate of this decrease was shallowest for first-order, luminance-defined patterns. For second-order motion <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> decreased at a similar rate for contrast, polarity and orientation but this decrease was steepest for spatial length. However, when equated in terms of visibility (multiples of direction-discrimination threshold), the rate at which <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> decreased as modulation depth increased became comparable for patterns defined by luminance, contrast, polarity and orientation. For patterns defined by spatial length, performance could not be equated in this manner. These findings demonstrate that the time taken to encode the direction of each pattern is not an invariant response metric. The results are consistent with psychophysical and electrophysiological evidence for longer response latencies for second-order motion and may reflect the additional processing stages (e. g. filter–rectify–filter) required for its extraction...|$|R
