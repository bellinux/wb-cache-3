5|$|In Luigi's Mansion, {{the main}} story is played out over four stages, with players able to also access a {{training}} <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> gallery at the laboratory of Professor E. Gadd between stages.

To assist him in his task, Luigi uses a flashlight and two inventions supplied by E. Gadd - the Poltergust 3000, a specially modified, high powered vacuum cleaner; and the Game Boy Horror, a parody of Nintendo's Game Boy Color.|$|E

5|$|Some repairs {{were made}} in 1604 by Alessandro Stafrace, after cracks {{appeared}} in part of the Main Hall. The auberge had an entrance facing a square in South Street, but this was blocked in 1629 when the square was built up (the square was recreated in 2012 as Jean de Valette Square). Historian Giovanni Bonello suggests {{that this was the}} main entrance of the auberge, although it might have just been a side entrance. In 1649–50, a mezzanine was built beneath the Admiral's <b>Room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> large room {{at the rear of the}} building was converted into four shops in 1654.
