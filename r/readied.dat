5000|$|In February 1998, the National Education Goals Panel convened {{national}} leadership {{to address the}} importance of schools being <b>ready</b> for all children. The panel identified ten keys to a <b>ready</b> school (The National Education Goals Panel, 1998) in recognition that <b>ready</b> children must attend schools that are <b>ready</b> for them. In 2006, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation (WKKF) Supporting Partnerships to Assure <b>Ready</b> Kids (SPARK) elected to advance the <b>ready</b> school agenda through their Pathways to <b>Ready</b> Schools. All SPARK recipients were required {{to develop a plan}} to address the school readiness concept within their overall SPARK plan. To address the concept of a <b>ready</b> school, the Sisters of Charity Foundation of Canton, the Ohio Department of Education (ODE), Office of Early Learning and School Readiness (EL&SR) and the Ohio Association of Elementary School Administrators (OAESA) entered into a partnership to develop a <b>ready</b> school guidance document. Ohio’s <b>ready</b> school proposal to WKKF emphasized that “readiness” is accomplished through the shared responsibility of early childhood educators and district leadership. The “leadership from both the early education and formal school arena must pave the way to create “enduring ties” that will lead to cohesive educational programs” (SPARK, Ohio <b>Ready</b> for School—Ready Schools proposal).|$|R
5|$|Purnell, Parsons, Tibbets, Spaatz, and LeMay met on Guam {{that same}} day to discuss {{what should be done}} next. Since there was no {{indication}} of Japan surrendering, they decided to proceed with dropping another bomb. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have it ready by August 11, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if the bomb could be <b>readied</b> by August 9. Parsons agreed to try to do so.|$|E
5|$|Two more Fat Man {{assemblies}} were <b>readied,</b> {{and scheduled}} to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on August 11 and 14, and Tibbets was ordered by LeMay {{to return to}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, to collect them. At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core. Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until August 16. Therefore, {{it could have been}} ready for use on August 19. Unable to reach Marshall, Groves ordered on his own authority on August 13 that the core should not be shipped.|$|E
5|$|A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's {{presence}} and numbers late on Thursday March 21. The next morning, a Muslim conference of war convened, {{and there was}} dispute over how to best repel the Meccans. Muhammad {{and many of the}} senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and <b>readied</b> the Muslim force for battle.|$|E

The Soviet personnel at the airfield provided considerable assistance, {{but the process}} of refuelling the aircraft could not be completed until 13 September due to inadequate facilities. The ground crew also repaired some of the damaged bombers, including with parts salvaged from the aircraft which had been written off. The British officers and senior non-commissioned officers were accommodated in a boat, and all other personnel slept in overcrowded underground huts. Both the boat and the huts were infested with bed bugs, {{and almost all of}} the airmen were bitten before the accommodation was fumigated by the detachment's medical officer.|$|E

The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down {{into what was}} essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded onto eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, the sections of UB-10 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After UB-10 was assembled and launched on 20 February, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.|$|E
5|$|Ancona {{was quickly}} <b>readied</b> for combat when Italy {{declared}} {{war against the}} Austrian Empire in the Third Italian War of Independence in June 1866. The following month, she joined the Italian fleet at the Battle of Lissa. She was stationed in the van of the Italian fleet, which became separated {{from the rest of}} the fleet. Ancona was damaged by Austrian shellfire, including one shell that started a fire. Her career was uneventful after the war, resulting from a combination of the emergence of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. She was rebuilt as a central battery ship some time after Lissa, and was eventually sold for scrapping in 1903.|$|E
