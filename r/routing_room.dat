40|$|Micro-vias are minute {{holes in}} circuit boards with a {{diameter}} of 6 mils or less that are placed within or underneath component pads. These structures allow the interconnection of outer and inner layers, which results in an increased routing area or available space for the placement of denser components. A via-in-pad is a plated-through hole that is used as an interlayer connection from a component land, but {{in which there is}} no intention to insert a component lead or other reinforcing material. However, the ability to either place vias on or off the pads gives designers greater flexibility to selectively create <b>routing</b> <b>room</b> in denser parts of the substrate. This is phase 1 of an R&D project and this paper presents the solderability results for different via-in-pad locations and sizes based on assembly criteria. Although the design includes Ball Grid Arrays (BGAs), Quad Flat Packs (QFPs) and passive components, only BGAs were examined at this stage. Since the primary analysis will be void formation the samples were analyzed using X-Ray Laminography and conclusions drawn. The results of this experiment may not reflect the impact on high volume manufacturing...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{an integrated}} nanophotonic network in diamond, {{consisting of a}} ring resonator coupled to an optical waveguide with grating in- and outcouplers. Using a nitrogen-vacancy color center embedded inside the ring resonator {{as a source of}} photons, single photon generation and <b>routing</b> at <b>room</b> temperature is observed. Furthermore, we observe a large overall photon extraction efficiency (10 %) and high quality factors of ring resonators (3200 for waveguide-coupled system and 12 [*] 600 for a bare ring) ...|$|R
40|$|For the macro-cell design {{style and}} for routing {{problems}} where the routing regions are irregular, two dimensional routers are often necessary. In this paper a new routing technique {{that can be}} applied for general two-layer detailed routing problems including switch boxes, channels and partially routed areas, is presented. The routing regions that can be handled are very general: the boundaries can be described by any rectilinear chains and the pins can be on the boundaries of the region or inside it, the obstructions can be of any shape and size. The technique is based on an algorithm that routes incrementally and intelligently the nets in the routing region and allows modifications and rip-up of nets that may impede the complete routing of other nets. The modification steps (also called weak modification) push some segments of nets already <b>routed</b> to make <b>room</b> for a blocked net. The rip-up and re-route steps (called strong modification), remove segments of nets already <b>routed</b> to make <b>room</b> for a blocked connection and is invoked only if weak modification fails. The algorithm is rigorously proven to complete in finite time and it...|$|R

In 1961 he joined the BBC World Service as a Technical Operator in the Control Room at Bush House, doing recording operations on disk and tape as well as Control <b>Room</b> <b>routing.</b> In 1964 he became a Studio Manager - operating studio mixing desks and playback equipment - at Broadcasting House, {{moving on to the}} BBC Regional studios at Bristol in 1966 where he eventually became the principal Film Dubbing Mixer, responsible for, among many other things, the final mix on David Attenborough's famous wildlife series Life on Earth.|$|R
6000|$|The next {{evidence}} is {{ten years after}} date, the statements taken down by Jack Wesley in 1726 (1720?). Mrs. Wesley adds to her former account that she [...] "earnestly desired it might not disturb her" [...] (at her devotions) [...] "between five and six in the evening," [...] {{and it did not}} <b>rout</b> in her <b>room</b> at that time. Emily added that a screen was knocked at on each side as she went round to the other. Sukey mentioned the noise as, on one occasion, coming gradually from the garret stairs, outside the nursery door, up to Hetty's bed, [...] "who trembled strongly in her sleep. It then removed to the room overhead, where it knocked my father's knock on the ground, as if it would beat the house down." [...] Nancy said that the noise used to follow her, or precede her, and once a bed, on which she sat playing cards, was lifted up under her several times to a considerable height. Robin, the servant, gave evidence that he was greatly plagued with all manner of noises and movements of objects.|$|R
40|$|Many {{patients}} face difficulties when accessing medical facilities, {{particularly in}} rural areas. To alleviate these concerns, medical centers may offer transportation to eligible patients. However, {{the operation of}} such services is typically not tightly coordinated with the scheduling of medical appointments. Motivated by our collaborations with the U. S. Veterans Health Administration, we propose an integrated approach that simultaneously considers patient <b>routing</b> and operating <b>room</b> scheduling decisions. We model this problem as a mixed-integer program. Unfortunately, realistically sized instances of this problem are intractable, so we focus on a special case of the problem that captures the needs of low-volume (e. g., rural) hospitals. We establish structural properties that are exploited to develop a branch-and-price algorithm, which greatly outperforms a commercial solver on the original formulation. We discuss several algorithmic strategies to improve the overall solution efficiency. We evaluate {{the performance of the}} proposed approach through an extensive computational study calibrated with clinical data. Our results demonstrate that there exist opportunities for healthcare providers to significantly improve the quality of their services by integrating scheduling and routing decisions...|$|R
