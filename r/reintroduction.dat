5|$|Along with cougars, timber wolves are {{the largest}} top predators {{that live in the}} forest and have no predators of their own except humans. Most of the area's native mammal species are present in the forest, with the {{exception}} of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct. Plans for their <b>reintroduction</b> to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, but have not progressed because of concerns similar to those with the wolf <b>reintroduction</b> as well as fears for human safety. The northern and high elevation areas of the forest contain habitat for wolverines and the endangered Canadian lynx, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the capture of all the wild individuals of the California condor, in 1988 the US Fish and Wildlife Service began a <b>reintroduction</b> experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California. Only females were released to prevent it becoming an invasive species. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America before the <b>reintroduction</b> of the California condors took place.|$|E

50|$|Apparently, the German <b>reintroductions</b> {{have allowed}} eagle-owls to repopulate {{neighbouring}} parts of Europe, as the breeding populations now {{occurring in the}} Low Countries (Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) {{are believed to be}} the result of influx from regions further to the east.

5|$|Besides {{customer}} {{demand for}} the product, another major reason for the <b>reintroduction</b> was due to a significant rise {{in the cost of}} beef. During the previous few {{months leading up to the}} <b>reintroduction</b> of Chicken Fries, the available cattle stocks had declined since the USDA began record keeping in 1973. This shortage of ground beef caused a spike in the price of beef to all-time highs in June 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, increasing competition from McDonald's, Wendy's and other chains in the fast food industry drove Burger King to boost sales by introducing new products along similar lines. Two major competitors had been revamping their menus with products such as variations on the McDouble from McDonald's and sandwiches based on pretzel-style buns from Wendy's.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reintroductions</b> of captive bred populations {{can occur}} to {{replenish}} wild populations of an endangered species, {{to create new}} populations or to restore a species after it has become extinct in the wild. <b>Reintroductions</b> helped bring the wild populations of Hawaiian geese (nene) from 30 birds to over 500. The Mauritius kestrel was successfully reintroduced into the wild after its captive breeding programme. <b>Reintroductions</b> can be very difficult and often fail if insufficient preparations are made, as species born in captivity may lack {{the skills and knowledge}} needed for life in the wild after living in captivity. <b>Reintroductions</b> can also fail if the causes of a birds decline have not been adequately addressed. Attempts to reintroduce the Bali starling into the wild failed due to continued poaching of reintroduced birds.|$|R

5|$|Captive {{populations of}} both ruffed lemur species exist in American and European zoos, {{representing}} a safeguard against extinction. In the United States, captive breeding is {{managed by the}} Species Survival Plan (SSP), a program developed by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Although the populations are very limited in their genetic diversity, these species thrive in captivity, making them an ideal candidate for <b>reintroduction</b> into protected habitat, if it is available. Although <b>reintroduction</b> {{is seen as a}} last resort among conservationists, a combination of in situ conservation efforts, such as legal protection, public education, the spread of sustainable livelihoods, and reforestation offer hope for ruffed lemurs. In the meantime, reintroductions offer conservation research opportunities and allow the limited genetic diversity maintained by the SSP to improve the genetic diversity of dwindling Malagasy ruffed lemur populations.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{measures}} being undertaken include international cooperation, legal protection, research, monitoring, habitat management, {{education and}} the maintenance of captive flocks for propagation and <b>reintroduction.</b> Although the bird breeds well in the wild, it has proved much more problematic to get it to breed while in captivity.|$|E

Site selection, release strategies (e. g. number, composition and timing), population viability and management impacts are the key issues often investigated. We discuss {{how to deal with}} uncertainties associated with parameter estimation, stochasticity, model selection, integrating modelling approaches and decision making. Finally, we highlight three promising modelling approaches for planning species <b>reintroductions</b> and modelling reintroduced populations: decision theory and optimisation, individual-based modelling and Bayesian hierarchical modelling...|$|R

5|$|The North American {{river otter}} is {{considered}} a species of least concern according to the IUCN Red List, as it is not currently declining at a rate sufficient for a threat category. By the early 1900s, river otter populations had declined throughout large portions of their historic range in North America. However, improvements in water quality (through enactment of clean water regulations) and furbearer management techniques have permitted river otters to regain portions of their range in many areas. <b>Reintroduction</b> projects have been particularly valuable in restoring populations {{in many areas of}} the United States. However, river otters remain rare or absent in the southwestern United States. Water quality and development inhibit recovery of populations in some areas. The species is widely distributed throughout its range. In many places, the populations have re-established themselves because of conservation initiatives. <b>Reintroduction</b> of river otters may present a problem in that it may contaminate the genetic structure of the native population.|$|E
