30|$|Students {{perceived}} different socio-physical boundaries {{existed between}} internal and DE study utilising online learning. DE students perceived internal lectures occurring in fixed times/spaces constituted ‘normal’ higher education, rather than construed {{them as an}} outdated or disadvantageous learning mode. Students unable {{to meet the demands}} of internal study exhibited victimised individualism by accepting their personal circumstances were at-fault, rather than expecting universities to better accommodate mature-age students’ availability for face-to-face learning. Conversely, online learning was held to disproportionally rigours temporal standards. Despite asynchronous online forums being available 24 / 7, and synchronous chat available at designated times, the unavailability of on-demand synchronous communication with lecturers to accommodate individual learning needs was highlighted as lacking and disadvantaging students’ learning. Not being able to talk to [the] lecturer (ID 247) whenever any student personally desired was a limitation noted by one under- 20 Sydneysider. Such sentiments traversed student age, however, as mature-age students, such as a student living on ‘the coast’ who lamented the inability to ask ‘on the spot’ questions (ID 250) when studying by distance, reflected similar perceptions. Although occasionally students listed lecturer quickness in responses (ID 73) as an advantage of online learning, more commonly the response rate of lecturer-to-student online communication was perceived as too slow. Responses were expected from DE lecturers within minutes of students’ typing forum postings or emails. Discourse used, such as needing ‘immediate’ replies, reflected different communication expectations than those found in traditional classroom environments where hours or days intervened between student/lecturer interactions. Inability to further clarify immediately (ID 250), not able to get immediate assistance from a teacher (ID 239), lack of immediate discussion of material (ID 88), and it takes time for e-mails/phone call to be <b>returned</b> (<b>ID</b> 254) are examples reflecting expectations of immediate communication with online enrolment.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{applications}} like location-based services, sensor {{monitoring and}} biological databases, {{the values of}} the database items are inherently uncertain in nature. An important query for uncertain objects is the Probabilistic Nearest-Neighbor Query (PNN), which computes the probability of each object for being the nearest neighbor of a query point. Evaluating this query is computationally expensive, since it needs to consider the relationship among uncertain objects, and requires the use of numerical integration or Monte-Carlo methods. Sometimes, a query user may not be concerned about the exact probability values. For example, he may only need answers that have sufficiently high confidence. We thus propose the Constrained Nearest-Neighbor Query (C-PNN), which <b>returns</b> the <b>IDs</b> of objects whose probabilities are higher than some threshold, with a given error bound in the answers. The C-PNN can be answered efficiently with probabilistic verifiers. These are methods that derive the lower and upper bounds of answer probabilities, so that an object can be quickly decided on whether it {{should be included in the}} answer. We have developed three probabilistic verifiers, which can be used on uncertain data with arbitrary probability density functions. Extensive experiments were performed to examine the effectiveness of these approaches. I...|$|R

On the other hand, he claimed agency over his return by stressing that he returned even though he did not have to (yet), because he was needed by his family. To match his limited capacities, Hamid highlighted the desire to be in his ‘mother’ country and to support his parents, in order to claim agency over his return.|$|R

40|$|In several {{emerging}} {{and important}} applications, such as location-based services, sensor monitoring and biological databases, {{the values of}} the data items are inherently imprecise. A useful query class for these data is the Probabilistic Nearest-Neighbor Query (PNN), which yields the IDs of objects for being the closest neighbor of a query point, together with the objects' probability values. Previous studies showed that this query {{takes a long time to}} evaluate. To address this problem, we propose the Constrained Nearest-Neighbor Query (C-PNN), which <b>returns</b> the <b>IDs</b> of objects whose probabilities are higher than some threshold, with a given error bound in the answers. We show that the C-PNN can be answered efficiently with verifiers. These are methods that derive the lower and upper bounds of answer probabilities, so that an object can be quickly decided on whether it should be included in the answer. We design five verifiers, which can be used on uncertain data with arbitrary probability density functions. We further develop a partial evaluation technique, so that a user can obtain some answers quickly, without waiting for the whole query evaluation process to be completed (which may incur a high response time). In addition, we examine the maintenance of a long-standing, or continuous C-PNN query. This query requires any update to be applied to the result immediately, in order to reflect the changes to the database values (e. g., due to the change of the location of a moving object). We design an incremental update method based on previous query answers, in order to reduce the amount of I/O and CPU cost in maintaining the correctness of the answers to such a query. Performance evaluation on realistic datasets show that our methods are capable of yielding timely and accurate results. © 2009 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

When the realization hits her, she is shocked that she has been lied to by Jack for this long and struggles with her emotions regarding the situation. Milly tries to put aside her worry over realizing Jack is a criminal and live a normal life with him. She routinely tries to get Jack to admit that he is a criminal, but he always evades her questions and begins accusing her of being mentally ill. She later witnesses Jack in the midst of committing a crime, which greatly upsets her. Jack continues to treat Milly poorly for worrying about his well-being in his line of work. Milly is present at a bank during one of Jack and his accomplices’ heists. She leaves unharmed, but furious with Jack. Captain comes to inform Milly that Jack has been arrested, and she plans to visit him in jail. Milly visits Jack in jail and he is rude to her. He is sentenced to a couple weeks in jail. Much to Milly's surprise, Jack escapes and is home one evening when she returns from work. Milly pleads with Jack to leave his life as a criminal and threatens to end their relationship if he does not. She also informs him that she is pregnant and that she wants to finally marry, to which he does not agree. Jack leaves the country, forcing Milly to adjust to life alone. He returns one day and vows to stop being a criminal so that they can marry and have a quiet life, but soon goes back on his word and becomes involved in more bank robberies. The police again capture Jack and after a few days in prison, he is sentenced to twenty years. Milly recounts the trial from her position as a witness and admits that her love for Jack ended there.

The way memory size is indicated by the users in flash. begin(flashChipSize) has changed - please refer to defines. h or the wiki for further information. The new method enables users to define any custom size unlike the previous version where only a limited number of predetermined sizes were available to use. Library faster than before: Improvements in speed in v 3. 0. 0 when compared to v 2. 7. 0 (values in percentage of time v 3. 0. 0 is faster than v 2. 7. 0) Function Change in speed writeByte + 3 % writeChar + 6 % writeWord + 3 % writeShort + 5 % writeULong + 7 % writeLong + 7 % readLong + 7 % writeFloat + 7 % writeStr + 57 % readStr + 61 % writeAnything + 25 % readAnything (struct) + 20 % writeByteArray + 18 % readByteArray (256 bytes) + 45 % eraseSector + 99 % eraseBlock 32 K + 99. 4 % eraseBlock 64 K + 99. 5 % eraseChip + 12 % Constructor changed to enable user to choose one of multiple SPI ports - if available. Look at wiki for further info When RUNDIAGNOSTIC is uncommented in SPIFlash. h, users now have access to a new function called flash. functionRunTime() which can be called after any library I/O function is run. flash. functionRunTime() returns the time taken by the previous function to run, in microseconds (as a float). An example use case can be found when the FlashDiagnostics sketch is run with RUNDIAGNOSTIC uncommented. _notBusy() is faster Completely re-written FlashDiagnostics - uses fewer resources, compatible with more chips and boards All functions except the Byte/Char Array Read/Write functions now call an internal _write/_read function for increased ease of compilation, execution and troubleshooting Restructured the internal _troubleshoot() function to be better human readable and faster to compile. Added a function getUniqueID() which <b>returns</b> the unique <b>ID</b> of the flash memory chip as a 64 -bit integer. Added an internal _readStat 3 () function to enable 4 -byte addressing when using flash memory larger than 128 MB 4 -byte addressing enabled in flash memory larger than 128 MB. This is currently only supported on the W 25 Q 256 and W 25 Q 512. More chips will be supported on a case-by-case basis getAddress() function now works anytime it is called - even if there is preexisting data on the chi...|$|R
