40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to give axiomatic {{characterization}} of quantum relative entropy utilizing resource conversion scenario. We consider two sets of axioms: non-asymptotic and asymptotic. In the former setting, we prove that the upperbound and the lowerbund of D^Q(ρ||σ) is D^R(ρ||σ) :=trρlnσ^ 1 / 2 ρ^- 1 σ^ 1 / 2 and D(ρ||σ) := trρ(lnρ-lnσ), respectively. In the latter setting, we prove uniqueness of quantum relative entropy, that is, D^Q(ρ||σ) should equal a constant multiple of D(ρ||σ). In the analysis, we define and use <b>reverse</b> <b>test</b> and asymptotic <b>reverse</b> <b>test,</b> which are natural inverse of hypothesis test. Comment: A new proof of joint convexity of D^R is added. Also, some technical correction, Title change...|$|R

We analytically establish the asymptotic distribution of the test and also explore its finite-sample properties through Monte-Carlo simulation. Following Ramsey and Rothman (1996), who demonstrated that the problem of business cycle asymmetry can be stated as whether macroeconomic fluctuations are time irreversible, in our application we use the <b>REVERSE</b> <b>test</b> as a frequency domain test of business cycle asymmetry. Our empirical results show that time irreversibility is the rule rather than the exception for a representative set of macroeconomic time series for five OECD countries. * The authors thank the participants of the 1996 symposium of the Society for Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics for their helpful comment...|$|R

This paper sketches a framework for a quantitative <b>reverse</b> stress <b>test</b> for maturity-transforming banks that are exposed to credit and interest rate risk and demonstrates how the model can be calibrated empirically. The main features of the proposed framework are: 1) The necessary steps of a <b>reverse</b> stress <b>test</b> (solving an inversion problem and computing the scenario probabilities) can be performed within one model, 2) Scenarios are characterized by realizations of macroeconomic risk factors, 3) Principal component analysis helps to reduce the dimensionality of the space of systematic risk factors, 4) Due to data limitations, the results of <b>reverse</b> stress <b>tests</b> are exposed to considerable model and estimation risk, which makes numerous robustness checks necessary...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis for the bachelors degree {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} and subsequent evaluation of the fawn mortality during haymaking in the hunting district HS Kalec, county Plzeň-sever (Pilsen-North), located {{in the western part}} of the Czech Republic. The first part of this thesis describes Roe Deer (Capreolus Capreolus), its population in this territory, biology, ethology and its management. The second part describes the project as such involving three model <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> that were selected and marked out in the hunting district HS Kalec; before the haymaking time from June 15 to June 24, 2015, adequate protection measures were undertaken in these areas. Locality of the first model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 1 was attended (walked) by gamekeepers with dogs. Locality of the second model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 2 was treated with the game scent repeller and also equipped with acoustic disturber. The third model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 3 was only monitored. These model <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> were re-visited after hay crop and the result is that in the vicinity of the model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 3 two fawns were cut and killed. In both other model <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> no cut fawns were found. After hay crop and subsequent determining the actual number of cut fawns, these <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> were compared mutually and the results will be stated in this thesis for the bachelors degree. The essential aspect was to evaluate the fawns mortality in the specific hunting district based on the obtained facts. Relation to the mitigation measures set in place was examined. This work resulted in saving three fawns. Outcomes of this thesis have provided rather interesting findings that can be further exploited in the gamekeeping management. Particularly in relation to the roe deer management in the gamekeeping practice. Keywords/tags: roe deer, fawns, killing, hunting district (HS Kalec, Žihle...|$|R

30|$|The {{conception}} of a GMP monitoring program - selection of <b>test</b> <b>areas,</b> appropriate indicators, methods, farmers' clarification, etc. - should start far earlier than the GMP cropping. Importantly, the initial sampling design has to consider that farmers may deny work on their private properties. A total of 1, 360 involved farmers were informed about the project BINATS. Sixty-nine of these denied work on their fields. Twenty-seven of the 100 pre-selected <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> were affected by this prohibition. Twenty-one of these <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> could be retained by shifting survey circles appropriately [48]. Six <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> had to be shifted as a whole along the Austrian forest inventory raster. However, sizes of Austrian farms are small (average farm size, 18.9 ha) [59] as compared to other EU countries, and problems with denied access may be more serious with larger farm sizes.|$|R

Taking three geomorphological units {{in different parts of}} the loess as <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> and 5 m-resolution DEMs as original test date, this paper employed the changed ROC-LV (Lucian, 2010) in judging the optimal scales in the slope segmentation process. The experiment results showed that this method is effective in determining the optimal scale in the slope segmentation. The results also showed that the slope segmentation of the different geomorphological units require different optimal scales because the landform complexity is varied. The three <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> require the same scale which could distinguish the small gully because all the <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> have many gullies of the same size, however, when come to distinguish the basins, since the complexity of the three areas is different, the <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> require different scales...|$|R
