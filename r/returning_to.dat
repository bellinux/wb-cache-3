5|$|After <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> New York on 31 May {{by way of}} Reykjavík and Halifax, West Cheswald made a brief trip to Philadelphia {{and back}} before she worked {{her way down the}} East Coast to Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived on 17 June. Sailing the next day, the cargo ship began the first of two African trips, during which she made many of the same ports as in her two 1941 voyages. On the homeward leg of her second voyage, she called at Takoradi and Freetown on the western coast of Africa in March 1943. After <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> the Americas, West Cheswald visited Saint Thomas, San Juan, and Mayagüez in the Caribbean before <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> Philadelphia on 28 April.|$|E

30|$|Whilst {{there is}} yet to be {{consensus}} on the preferred terminology, two papers have attempted to provide working definitions [3, 4]. Lynch et al. [3] initially defined <b>return</b> <b>to</b> sport as “one or two seasons in the sport of injury at the same level as prior to injury”. More recently a consensus statement described a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> sport continuum [4]. The continuum has three elements, the first being a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> participation, the second a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> sport and the third a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> performance. <b>Return</b> <b>to</b> participation may be a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> training or a level of sport that is lower that what the athlete desires. A <b>return</b> <b>to</b> sport is designated as the athlete having <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> their pre-injury sport of choice but not performing at the desired level, whereas a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> performance signifies that the athlete is now performing at or above the preinjury level in their chosen sport. Empirical application of this theoretical continuum has however not yet been validated for <b>return</b> <b>to</b> sport after ACL reconstruction.|$|R

50|$|The laws of <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> {{scale are}} {{a set of}} three interrelated and {{sequential}} laws:Law of Increasing <b>Returns</b> <b>to</b> Scale,Law of Constant <b>Returns</b> <b>to</b> Scale,and Law of Diminishing <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> Scale.If output increases by that same proportional change as all inputs change then there are constant <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale (CRS). If output increases by less than that proportional change in inputs, there are decreasing <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale (DRS). If output increases by more than the proportional change in inputs, there are increasing <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale (IRS). A firm's production function could exhibit different types of <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale in different ranges of output. Typically, there could be increasing returns at relatively low output levels, decreasing returns at relatively high output levels, and constant returns at one output level between those ranges.|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{a structural}} dynamic programming model of schooling decisions and obtain individual specific {{estimates of the}} local (and average) <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> schooling {{as well as the}} <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience. Homogeneity of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> human capital is strongly rejected in favor of a discrete distribution version of the random coefficient specification. The results indicate that individuals who have the higher <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> schooling are also those who have the higher <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience. There is a 5. 9 percentage points difference in the average <b>return</b> <b>to</b> schooling at college graduation between high and low market ability individuals (2. 3 % vs 8. 2 %) and a 5. 4 percentage points difference in the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> experience upon entrance in the labor market (3. 1 % vs 8. 5 %). When averaged over all types, the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> experience in the early phase of the life cycle (6. 8 %) exceeds the average <b>return</b> <b>to</b> schooling (6. 4 % at college graduation). After conditioning on a specific type, the log wage regression function remains rather convex in schooling. The conflictual effects of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> schooling and experience on schooling decisions imply weak dynamic self-selection; that is educational attainments are only weakly correlated with individual differences in the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> schooling...|$|R
30|$|To {{summarize}} {{our results}} about the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> {{different types of}} specific human capital, we find a strong <b>return</b> <b>to</b> tenure in the formal sector, but no significant <b>return</b> <b>to</b> tenure in the informal sector. Our estimates of 10 -year <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> employer, occupation, industry, and sector tenure indicate that formal sector tenure matters more than other specific human capital, namely employer or occupation tenure. In addition <b>to</b> the strong <b>return</b> <b>to</b> formal sector tenure, we find significant <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> potential experience with and without controlling for sector tenure, {{which is consistent with}} previous findings in the literature.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{differences}} in private marginal <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education between wage-employees and the self-employed in Uganda, using the Mincerian framework with pooled regression models. We use a two-wave household panel to estimate homogenous and heterogeneous private <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education for both worker types. The study finds similar marginal <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> an additional year of schooling for both worker types. Further, the study finds the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> educational qualifications are convex for wage-employees and concave for the self-employed. With regard <b>to</b> heterogeneous <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education, we employ quantile regression models and find <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education decreasing with quantile for both worker types...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} examines {{differences in}} earnings structure between Communist and post-Communist Czech Republic and Slovakia using {{four sets of}} similar micro-data. It presents hypotheses about how earnings dispersion <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education and <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience will change across regimes and tests those hypotheses using earnings equations. From approximately 2. 5 percent in 1984, the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> education increased to approximately 5 percent by 1993. During that period, <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience fell. Though women have higher <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education, <b>returns</b> for men increased more across regime change. Those with academic secondary education experienced a particularly large earnings increase. Earnings structure changes appear larger in the Czech Republic than in Slovakia.
