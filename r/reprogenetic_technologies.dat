2500|$|Dov Fox, a law {{professor}} at the University of San Diego, argues that liberal eugenics cannot be justified on the basis of the underlying liberal theory which inspires it. He introduces an alternative to John Rawls's social primary goods that might be called natural primary goods: heritable mental and physical capacities and dispositions that are valued across a range of projects and pursuits. He suggests that <b>reprogenetic</b> <b>technologies</b> like embryo selection, cellular surgery, and human genetic engineering, which aim to enhance [...] "general purpose" [...] traits in offspring are less like childrearing practices a liberal government leaves to the discretion of parents than like practices the state makes compulsory.|$|E
5000|$|Bill McKibben, for example, {{suggests}} that emerging <b>reprogenetic</b> <b>technologies</b> would be disproportionately {{available to those}} with greater financial resources, thereby exacerbating the {{gap between rich and}} poor and creating a [...] "genetic divide". Lee M. Silver, a biologist and science writer who coined the term [...] "reprogenetics" [...] and supports its applications, has nonetheless expressed concern that these methods could create a two-tiered society of genetically-engineered [...] "haves" [...] and [...] "have nots" [...] if social democratic reforms lag behind implementation of <b>reprogenetic</b> <b>technologies.</b>|$|E
50|$|Germinal choice {{technology}} {{refers to}} a set of <b>reprogenetic</b> <b>technologies</b> that, currently or that are expected to in the future, allow parents to influence the genetic constitutions of their children. This could be done through genetic screening of blastocysts (early embryos), or through germline engineering, which refers to human genetic engineering used to alter genes in the first cells of the blastocyst. Germline engineering changes the genes in a sperm or an egg, which impacts all future DNA of every cell in the embryo. The philosophical movement associated with this technology is transhumanism.|$|E
40|$|A new <b>reprogenetic</b> <b>technology,</b> {{mitochondrial}} replacement, {{is making}} its appearance and, unsurprisingly given its promise to wash off our earthly stains [...] {{or at least the}} scourges of sexual reproduction [...] , John Harris finds only reasons to celebrate this new scientific feat. 1 In fact, he finds mitochondrial replacement techniques (MRTs) so “unreservedly welcome” that he believes those who reject them suffer from “a large degree of desperation and not a little callousness. ” 2 Believing myself to be neither desperate nor callous, but finding myself also no closer at all – not even after reading his article—to following Harris in welcoming these technologies wholeheartedly, it seems appropriate to respond...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} formed of three chapters. The first chapter {{examines}} {{the effect on}} social mobility and economic growth following the introduction of <b>reprogenetic</b> <b>technology</b> such that parents can choose {{to invest in the}} talent or ability of their unborn children. I find that if the economy is initially in a steady state such that social mobility is low, the introduction of such technology can increase social mobility and economic growth. If the economy is initially in a steady state such that social mobility is high, then the introduction of such technology will not increase (and may decrease) social mobility and will not affect economic growth. The second chapter is {{a review of the literature}} on how immigration affects wages focusing on studies of the US and UK labour markets. The third chapter analyses how the skill premium depends on the relative supply of high and low skilled workers in the economy, and the size of the economy. Using a two-sector model where one sector is more skill-intensive than the other, and returns to scale are larger in the skill-intensive sector, I find that the skill premium depends positively on the size of the economy. I consider the effect of an exogenous increase in the number of skilled workers (perhaps due to immigration) on the skill premium and find that under certain conditions the skill premium may increase. I then analyse the effect on the skill premium and the relative price of the skill intensive good in the short and long run and compare the models predictions to the data...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{individuals}} to choose their children 2 ̆ 7 s genes has increased over time and may ultimately culminate in a world involving free market <b>reprogenetic</b> <b>technologies.</b> <b>Reprogenetic</b> <b>technologies</b> combine advances in reproductive biology and genetics to provide humans increased control over their children 2 ̆ 7 s genes. This Article offers economic perspectives that are helpful in understanding the possibly unexpected ethical, legal, and social issues at stake in using <b>reprogenetic</b> <b>technologies</b> for trait enhancement selection. The Appendix analyzes two competitive games that might arise in such a biotechnological society. Specifically, the Article focuses on herd behavior, caused by either a popularity contest or positional competition, {{in the choice of}} genetic traits. The analytical game-theoretic models in the Appendix can have several equilibrium outcomes in terms of individual reprogenetic technological choices and corresponding beliefs about such choices by others. This multiplicity of potential social outcomes suggests that a society can attain efficiency if the state or some private organization transforms individual parents 2 ̆ 7 beliefs over the choices of other parents regarding their children 2 ̆ 7 s traits and, thus, coordinates parental reprogenetic decisions by selecting, as focal, certain beliefs over parents 2 ̆ 7 reprogenetic decisions...|$|E
40|$|This paper forms part of {{the feminist}} {{critique}} of the regulatory consequences of biomedicine’s systematic exclusion {{of the role of}} women’s bodies in the development of <b>reprogenetic</b> <b>technologies.</b> I suggest that strategic use of notions of the sacred to decontextualise and delimit disagreement fosters this marginalisation. Here conceptions of the sacred and sacralisation afford a means by which pragmatic consensus over regulation may be achieved, through the deployment of a bricolage of dense images associated with cultural loyalties to solidify support or exclude contradictory elements. Hence an explicit renegotiation of the symbolic order structuring salient debates is necessary to disrupt and enrich the entrenched and exclusionary dominant discourse over reprogenetic regulation. I draw upon previous analyses of strategic rhetoric associated with the regulation of infertility treatment and embryo research in the United Kingdom, the cultural anthropology of biomedicine and feminist ethnographies of reprogenetics to illustrate these claims...|$|E
