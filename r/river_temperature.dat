50|$|In 1971, {{the town}} of Falmouth {{purchased}} more than 100 acre of upland, cranberry bog, and Coonamesset River for the dual purposes of conservation and growing cranberries as published in the Town Meeting Warrant. Cranberry agriculture has {{played a major role}} in the Town of Falmouth's history and, as noted in the newspapers and correspondence from the Conservation Commission to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection shortly thereafter, the major goal was to preserve cranberry cultivation as farming was rapidly disappearing in Falmouth. Since this time, cranberry cultivation has continued unchanged while environmental awareness has increased, bringing the conservation goal to the fore. While the Coonamessett maintained a healthy herring run for many years alongside Cranberry cultivation, in recent years the herring run has undergone a massive decline, following a similar decrease across New England which has been widely attributed to at-sea factors external to the rivers. In 2004, fish counters saw only 640 fish and the only about 2000 herring returned to spawn. Concern over the herring run and the disappearance of sea run trout has led to a consensus in the Town for better protection and improvement of the river for fisheries including herring. Critical problems include overfishing and Dutchman's Ditch at the head of the river. The latter provides the only access to Coonamessett Pond where the herring spawn. The ditch was dug between the stream and the river and lies above the water table during the summer, and is frequently dry when the main herring occurs throughout New England. The <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> was also raised by the creation of a through-flow agricultural reservoir and the lack of shade along much of the river above that tolerated by trout. Flooding of the bed of the river by sand released from behind dams due to bad river management has eliminated spawning grounds. Some issues raised in the debate over the depth of the river, which is the same as other major New England Herring runs, and nitrate loading have proved to be unfounded. Studies and measurements of nitrate released from commercial and natural bogs shows no significant difference, and both are sinks for nitrates. Many of the major problems have not been addressed in the current plans for the river, due largely to a lack of a consensus among all parties as to the extent and manner of future cranberry cultivation.|$|E
40|$|River/stream water {{temperature}} {{is one of}} the master water quality parameters as it controls several key iogeochemical, physical and ecological processes and river ecosystem functioning. Thermal regimes of several rivers have been substantially altered by climate change and other anthropogenic impacts resulting in deleterious impacts on river health. Given its importance, several studies have been conducted to understand the key processes defining {{water temperature}}, its controls and drivers of change. Temporal and spatial <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> changes are a result of complex interactions between climate, hydrology and landscape/basin properties, making it difficult to identify and quantify the effect of individual controls. There is a need to further improve our understanding of the causes of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in river temperatures and the governing processes altering river temperatures. Furthermore, to assess the impacts of changing river temperatures on the river ecosystem, it is crucial to better understand the responses of freshwater biota to simultaneously acting stressors such as changing river temperatures, hydrology and river quality aspects (e. g. dissolved oxygen levels). So far, only a handful of studies have explored the impacts of multiple stressors, including changing <b>river</b> <b>temperature,</b> on river biota and, thus, are not well known. This thesis, thus, analysed the changes in <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> behaviour at different scales and its effects on freshwater organisms. Firstly, at a regional scale, temporal changes in <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> within long (25 years) and short time periods (10 years) were quantified and the roles of climatic, hydrological and landscape factors were identified for North German rivers. Secondly, at a reach scale, spatial temperature heterogeneity in a sixth-order lowland river (River Spree) was quantified and the role of landscape factors in inducing such heterogeneity was elucidated. Thirdly, at a site scale, short-term behavioural responses (namely drift) of three benthic invertebrate species to varying levels of water temperature, flow, and dissolved oxygen, and to combinations of those factors were experimentally investigated. Results from this thesis showed that, at a regional scale, the majority of investigated rivers in Germany have undergone significant annual and seasonal warming in the past decades. Air temperature change was found to be the major control of increasing river temperatures and of its temporal variability, with increasing influence for increasing catchment area and lower altitudes (lowland rivers). Strongest <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> increase was observed in areas with low water availability. Other hydro-climatological variables such as flow, baseflow, NAO, had significant contributions in <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> variability. Spatial variability in <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> trend rates was mainly governed by ecoregion, altitude and catchment area via affecting the sensitivity of <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> to its local climate. At a reach scale as well, air temperature was the major control of the temporal variability in <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> over a period of nine months within a 200 km lowland river reach. The spatial heterogeneity of <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> in this reach was most apparent during warm months and was mainly a result of the local landscape settings namely, urban areas and lakes. The influence of urban areas was independent of its distance from the river edge, at least when present within 1 km. Heat advected from upstream reaches determined the base <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> while climatological controls induced <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> variations around that base temperature, especially below lakes. Riparian buffers were not found to be effective in substantially moderating <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> in reaches affected by lake warming due to the dominant advected heat from the upstream lake. Experimental investigation indicated that increasing water temperature had a stronger short-term effect on behavioural responses of benthic invertebrates, than simultaneous changes in flow or dissolved oxygen. Also, increases in water temperature was shown to affect benthic invertebrates more severely if accompanied by concomitant low dissolved oxygen and flow levels, while interactive effects among variables vary much among taxa. These results support findings of other studies that river warming, similar to climate change, might be a global phenomenon. Within Germany, lowland rivers are the most vulnerable to future warming, with reaches affected by urbanization and shallow lentic structures being more vulnerable and, therefore, requiring urgent attention. Furthermore, river biota in lowland rivers is particularly susceptible to short-term increases in <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> such as heat waves. Plantation of riparian buffers, a widely recognized practice to manage climate change effects, in the headwater reaches can be suggested to mitigate and prevent future warming of lowland rivers in general and also throughout river basins, as <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> response in lowland catchments is a culmination of local and upstream conditions. However, further <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> increase in lowland river reaches within or close to urban areas and shallow lentic structures will be more difficult to mitigate only via riparian shading and would require additional measure...|$|E

Understanding the mechanisms that link climate to <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> is critical for predicting the impact that climate change will have on aquatic species distribution, carbon cycling, and climate change feedback mechanisms as <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> exerts direct control over biological, physical, and chemical processes in the aquatic environment. We present the results from a basic dynamic stream temperature model for the Kuparuk River in Arctic Alaska. This model is used to determine and quantify mechanisms that control <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> and to identify additional mechanisms necessary to capture Arctic <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> regimes. This basic model accounts for heat exchange between {{the river and the}} atmosphere, river bed, and landscape through lateral inflows (combined surface and subsurface flow). The watershed was divided into headwater (lower order) and coastal (higher order) sections to determine spatial variability in dominant mechanisms. Due to the complexity of lateral inflows and minimal information on the spatial and temporal variability of volumes and temperatures, different simplified treatments were tested within the model. Based on two years of data and subsequent modeling, this basic model reproduced the thermal behavior in the coastal portion of the study reach, but not in the headwater regions. It is expected that due to smaller volumes of water in the lower order portions of the watershed, it is necessary to have more detailed information on channel morphology to capture the variability of surface areas with the highly transient flow regime. Further, additional heat transfer mechanisms such as surface and hyporheic transient storage may be necessary to capture temperature responses during low flow periods...|$|E

40|$|The {{impacts of}} climate change on Arctic river {{temperatures}} and the resulting influences on biogeochemical cycling and habitat suitability require research into controlling heat fluxes between Arctic rivers and their surroundings. Instrumentation of the Kuparuk River {{in the foothills of}} the Brooks Range, Alaska, USA, during the 2013 - 2015 open water seasons provided data required to populate and calibrate an instream temperature model. This model accounts for radiative, sensible, and latent heat fluxes at the air-water interface, conductive and friction heat fluxes at the water-sediment interface, and lateral inflows of heat and mass from surface and subsurface hillslope drainage adjacent to the river. Model outputs reproduce observed <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> dynamics throughout the watershed under high flows, with radiative heat fluxes dominating the total energy balance and lateral inflows contributing significantly following rainy periods of elevated hillslope drainage. Under low flows, however, observed river temperatures in the headwater portion of the watershed were significantly buffered when compared with simulated river temperatures that produced daily ranges in river temperatures up to 15 °C greater than were observed. <b>River</b> <b>temperature</b> observations were reproduced when advective heat fluxes at the water-sediment interface were incorporated, indicating that hyporheic exchange provides significant buffering capacity in Arctic river temperatures under low flows. The influence of hyporheic exchange on <b>river</b> <b>temperature</b> depends on residence times and the proximity of flow paths to the frozen soils below the river bed. Therefore, Arctic river temperatures may be significantly affected by alterations in sub-surface thaw, atmospheric conditions, and hillslope hydrology – all of which are projected to accompany changes in Arctic climate...|$|E
