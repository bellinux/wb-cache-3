500|$|Today, silver metal is {{primarily}} produced instead as a secondary byproduct <b>of</b> electrolytic <b>refining</b> <b>of</b> copper, <b>lead,</b> and zinc, and by {{application of the}} Parkes process on lead bullion from ore that also contains silver. In such processes, silver follows the non-ferrous metal in question through its concentration and smelting, and is later purified out. For example, in copper production, purified copper is electrolytically deposited on the cathode, while the less reactive precious metals such as silver and gold collect under the anode as the so-called [...] "anode slime". This is then separated and purified of base metals by treatment with hot aerated dilute sulfuric acid and heating with lime or silica flux, before the silver is purified to over 99.9% purity via electrolysis in nitrate solution.|$|R

40|$|Softening {{represents}} one of the stages in the pyrometallurgical <b>refining</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead,</b> in which oxygen is top-blown into a bath of impure bullion through a group of lances in order to preferentially oxidize arsenic, antimony and tin dissolved in the melt. The oxides of these species float to the melt surface, where they are removed as dross. It has been observed at Teck Cominco Lead Operations in Trail, BC that there is an "ignition temperature" in the range of 600 °C, below which the softening reactions are reported to occur very slowly, if at all. Currently, disproportionately large efforts are made to initiate and sustain the softening process. This research was motivated by Teck Cominco's wish to have a clearer understanding of the ignition temperature phenomena, and a more robust and reliable process control. Experimental trials were performed using a homemade thermogravimetric analyzer with a data acquisition system.

5|$|Smelting, {{which is}} an {{essential}} part of the primary production, is often skipped during secondary production. It is only performed when metallic lead had undergone significant oxidation. The process is similar to that of primary production in either a blast furnace or a rotary furnace, with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields. The Isasmelt process is a more recent method that may act as an extension to primary production; battery paste from spent lead–acid batteries has sulfur removed by treating it with alkali, and is then treated in a coal-fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen, which yields impure lead, with antimony the most common impurity. <b>Refining</b> <b>of</b> secondary <b>lead</b> is similar to that of primary lead; some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination, with bismuth and silver most commonly being accepted as impurities.|$|R
40|$|Impeller-stirred mixing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} processes employed throughout the chemical, metallurgical and allied industries. The research reported in this thesis is focused on impeller stirred mixing associated with the <b>refining</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> bullion. The aim of this process is to sequentially remove contained impurities such as copper, antimony, silver and bismuth. This occurs in hemispherical vessels, called kettles, where reagents are initially added to the lead bath to form surface dross that contains both the required impurity and a large amount of lead oxide. This dross is then continuously mixed back into the bath to remove the lead oxide and capture more of the required impurity. A key requirement for this process is to obtain and remove dross that contains a high concentration of the impurity. Although this process has been in operation for many years, there is very little known on how the fluid dynamics associated with the mixing process affects final dross content. The aim of this research is to fully investigate the lead refining process using scientific analysis methods that help understand the mixing process and provide design tools which can be used to optimise process conditions. The three methods of analysis used are: (1) Direct readings from a real kettle, (2) Physical modelling (using water), and finally (3) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The use of physical modelling, exploiting the techniques of similitude, to predict vortex was also validated. An Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) probe was used for the velocity measurement at various locations inside the water model and this gave valuable insight about the flow phenomena occurring inside the refining kettle. A particular important finding was that when fluid is stirred above certain rotational speed the vortex depth becomes independent of the Reynolds number of the operation. With regards CFD technology, the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method was used to capture the free surface and the Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) and Algebraic Slip Model (ASM) to simulate the dross phase. Appropriate methods were also used to represent the moving impeller region. Validation of simulation results against experimental data was very encouraging. Computed vortex depth showed the similar trend as observed during the experiments on the physical model. A design strategy was developed that integrates results from both physical and computational modelling to allow optimal process conditions to be predicted at the kettle design stage. The use of this integrated physical and computational modelling methodology successfully helped eliminate surface swirl by introducing baffles to the kettle. The design and introduction of these flow controllers was also validated to ensure that it optimised the dross mixing process and final impurity content in the dross.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{characterization of}} silver and bismuth refining crusts produced during the pyrometallurgical <b>refining</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> was undertaken. Parameters such as intermetallic crystal size and composition, and degree of metal entrainment were determined. Silver crust {{was found to be}} composed mostly of the $ epsilon$-phase (AgZn$ sb 3 $) with an average particle size of 50 $ mu$m. Liquid lead entrainment of 80 volume percent was measured. The intermetallic phase in bismuth crust was composed entirely of CaMg$ rm sb 2 Bi sb 2 $ crystals with an average diameter of 50 $ mu$m. Lead entrainment in bismuth crust was approximately 90 volume percent. The high degree of metal entrainment observed in both silver and bismuth crusts was not adequately explained through a capillary model of liquid metal entrainment in a static bed of solid particles. The models used to predict swelling in colloidal particle systems (such as clay soils) were found to better approximate the high degree of liquid entrainment. Experiments were performed in which particle beds of $ gamma$-phase ($ rm Ag sb 5 Zn sb 8 $) intermetallic compound were infiltrated with liquid lead under controlled conditions and examined under the optical microscope. Image analysis revealed pronounced swelling of fine particle beds relative to coarse. The effect was most noticeable for average particle diameters less than 100 $ mu$m where the solids volume fraction decreased from 50 to 30 vol. %. Data showed samples LO exhibit a constant increase in inter-particle spacing of approximately 50 $ mu$m. The increase in spacing explained the degree of swelling at low particle diameters and was also used to develop an expression to predict height of capillary rise. Based on an osmotic pressure analogy in colloidal particle systems, a swelling pressure term was defined to explain the increase in inter-particle spacing. The swelling pressure was defined as equal and opposite to the capillary pressure tending to force particles to random packing. It was concluded that swelling was related to mass transfer at the solid-liquid interface of the intermetallic crystals giving a reduced static pressure due to a localized minimization of Gibbs energy. The static pressure change (swelling pressure) was attributed to overlap of mass transfer boundary layers where mid-point static liquid metal pressure is less than the pressure in the bulk liquid. For the system studied, the mass transfer boundary layer was estimated to be approximately 100 $ mu$m in thickness. Further experiments, using the sessile drop technique, were used to support the study findings by showing rapid spreading of liquid lead on Ag-Zn intermetallic substrates. The rapid spreading was attributed to mass transfer at the solid-liquid interface giving a reduced interfacial energy, $ gamma sb{ rm s 1 }$ due to a localized reduction in Gibbs energy. The analysis of experimental results {{led to the development of}} two new industrial processes in the lead industry aimed at reducing lead loss to silver and bismuth crusts. Tests employing continuous agitation during bismuth removal from lead promoted the growth of large $ rm CaMg sb 2 Bi sb 2 $ crystals. The larger crystals minimized the effect of mass transfer boundary layer overlap and reduced lead entrainment from 90 to 80 volume percent. The addition of a low melting point KCl-ZnCl$ sb 2 $ salt during silver crust formation was found to remove up to 90 % of entrained lead by the salt preferentially wetting Ag-Zn intermetallic particles. This was found to eliminate surface forces which retained liquid in the system of solid particles...|$|E

It was found that optimizing an ionic molten oxide solution model that was conceptualized to contain Pb 2 + and O 2 - with AsO 3 - 4 and AsO 3 - 3 ions, or with SbO 3 - 4 and SbO 3 - 3 ions in the respective PbO rich regions of the Pb-As-O and the Pb-Sb-O systems, was able to accurately reproduce the measured and published thermodynamic data. It was {{also found that the}} subsystems in the PbO-As 2 O 3 -As 2 O 5 and PbO-Sb 2 O 3 -Sb 2 O 5 systems showed small deviation from the ideal ionic solution model and small magnitude excess Gibbs energy parameters were sufficient to fit the predicted liquidus curves to the experimental measurements. Arsenic in the + 3 and + 5 oxidation states was measured in the PbO rich region of the Pb-As-O liquid solution in the temperature range of 420 °C to 875 °C. The variability in the ratio of trivalent arsenic to the total arsenic content, as well as the complex variation of arsenic distribution between metal and oxide phases found strong interaction between the lead, arsenic and oxygen atoms at the 3 PbO to 1 AS 2 O 3 molar ratio thus suggesting a short range ordering corresponding to the formation of AsO 3 - 3 groupings, and indicating that the Pb 3 (AsO 3) 2 (l) species was likely to be present in the PbO rich region of the Pb-As-O system and contributing {{to an understanding of the}} Pb-As-O liquid oxide structure. Also, two new compounds (Pb 3 (AsO 3) 2 (s), Pb 2 AsO 4 (s)) were identified in the Pb-PbO-As 2 O 3 quenched samples via wavelength-dispersive spectrometry using the electron microprobe. The present work has application in commercial oxygen partial lead softening (OPLS), as uniquely practiced at Teck Cominco Ltd., British Columbia. There, pure oxygen gas is injected into the bath of impure bullion through a number of submerged lances in order to oxidize only part of the arsenic, antimony and tin into a slag phase. For such an operating practice, it was concluded from the visualization {{and quantitative}} oxidation experiments that the formation of solid oxides as the product of oxidation produced a physical barrier to the progress of oxidation and resulted in the commercially observed, highly-problematic, process initiation issues. When the product was liquid, there was much less of a barrier to rapid oxygen mass transfer to the minor element impurities and the softening reactions were easy to initiate. Such a change in the physical state of the products of oxidation was correlated to the optimized ternary Pb-As-O and Pb-Sb-O phase diagrams. A current point of interest in partial lead softening is to increase the arsenic content of the slag phase. Arsenic distribution between lead bullion and slag calculated by the optimized solution model of the Pb-As-O system suggests that this can be achieved in a counter-current contacting of the slag and bullion...|$|E
