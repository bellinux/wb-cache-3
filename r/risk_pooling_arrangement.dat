Because {{of the nature}} of the <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangement,</b> full nominal coverage is shown to be optimal, despite the presence of moral hazard, and positive loss-prevention effort levels are induced even at full nominal coverage. When marginal utility is convex and higher-order utility effects are sufficiently small, as the number of members in the pool increases, the effort levels of members decrease and, as the pool size approaches infinity, effort levels approach zero. The latter result suggests that moral hazard may define an optimal size for risk pooling arrangements...|$|E
30|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{proposed}} general guidelines {{to design and}} implement (or reform) unemployment benefit programs in developing countries. Our main proposition is that the debate between risk-pooling (traditional insurance) vs. savings is misplaced. We have shown that UI and UISAs are {{two sides of the}} same coin. In both cases, administrators need to keep track of contributions and benefits. The main difference is that the savings that accumulate in some of the accounts in a UI program are used to cover the accounts that have a negative balance (savings are taxed at a 100 percent rate). Clearly, under an ’actuarially fair’ <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangement,</b> none of the accounts would systematically accumulate savings or be in deficit. But this is not the case with traditional UI programs because plan members have different risk profiles. Given a level and duration of benefits and the contributions rate, some accounts can systematically accumulate savings (which are taxed) whereas others systematically run negative balances (which receive subsidies). These taxes and subsidies can reduce incentives to search, take, and keep jobs. At the other extreme, in the case of pure UISAs, savings are not taxed and individual accounts cannot become negative which improves incentives for job search. However, this also implies that workers are less protected against the risk of unemployment.|$|E

30|$|Similar {{to other}} {{insurance}} programs, unemployment benefit systems can either rely on risk-pooling or savings <b>arrangements.</b> In traditional <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements,</b> benefits are not linked to individuals’ contributions; benefits can be {{financed by the}} contributions of other members within the pool or a third party. 2 The two types of risk-pooling arrangements {{in the case of}} unemployment benefits are severance pay (where the employers <b>pools</b> the <b>risk</b> and finances the scheme) 3 and traditional unemployment insurance (where workers contribute to a common pool or fund that then pays the benefits of those who become unemployed). At the other extreme, in the case of unemployment individuals’ savings accounts (UISAs), workers self-insure based on their contributions and those of their employers. As discussed below, most countries that rely on savings arrangement also have a risk-pooling scheme either in the form of severance pay, a “solidary fund” that tops up the savings of vulnerable workers, or like in the case of Brazil classic unemployment insurance.|$|R
40|$|Pooling is {{the health}} system {{function}} whereby collected health revenues are transferred to purchasing organizations. Pooling ensures that the risk related to financing health interventions is borne by {{all the members of}} the pool and not by each contributor individually. Its main purpose is to share the financial risk associated with health interventions for which there is uncertain need. The arguments in favor of <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> in health care embody equity and efficiency considerations. The equity arguments reflect the view that society does not consider it to be fair that individuals should assume all the risk associated with their health care expenditure needs. The efficiency arguments arise because pooling can lead to major improvements in population health, can increase productivity, and reduces uncertainty associated with health care expenditure. The report considers four classes of risk pooling: no <b>risk</b> <b>pool,</b> under which all expenditure liability lies with the individual; unitary <b>risk</b> <b>pool,</b> under which all expenditure liability is transferred to a single national pool; fragmented <b>risk</b> <b>pools,</b> under which a series of independent <b>risk</b> <b>pools</b> (such as local governments or employer-based pools) are used; and integrated <b>risk</b> <b>pools,</b> under which fragmented <b>risk</b> <b>pools</b> are compensated for the variations in risk to which they are exposed. It notes that small, fragmented <b>risk</b> <b>pools,</b> which are the norm in developing countries, contribute to seriously adverse outcomes for health system performance. It therefore argues strongly for integration of <b>risk</b> <b>pools</b> as an important health system stewardship responsibility. There are numerous practical difficulties in making integration operational, so the report offers some guidance on implementation, noting that optimal design of <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements</b> depends heavily on local circumstances. It concludes with suggestions for a number of measures of health system performance that can offer indications of the success of <b>risk</b> <b>pool</b> integration...|$|R

30|$|There {{is still}} a support for the view that iddirs can extend their reach to other {{economic}} activities and influence quality of life. For instance, recently some iddirs are trying to widen their <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements</b> to cover {{a wide variety of}} tasks. For example, recognizing the devastating effects of financial crises on the livelihoods of many who live in poverty, iddirs (especially men’s iddirs) began offering credit for members. Also, it deserves to be noted that in a country where there are no viable welfare services meant for the majority, even a penny is worth, especially to the poor. However, a small number of participants were arguing that the financial assistance generated from their iddirs is limited to the execution of proper funeral. Nevertheless, even though the financial support is small it must not be overlooked. Abraham (2003) carried the idea a step further, arguing that financial assistance during bereavement doesn’t mean that it helps the poor for their future life but gives them confidence about at least a proper burial (Abraham 2003). Moreover, labor supports of members during bereavements need to be considered as an important economic support as it eases considerable burden for grieving members. Similarly, Aredo (2003) pointed out that {{it is true that the}} bulk of financial assistance from iddir covers funeral expenses and provides support to be bereaved family members (Aredo 2003). However, in particular urban areas, iddir has several functions other than the often-disapproved after-death services. There are iddirs which provide medical insurance (such provision covers a fraction of total expense). Abraham (2003) further pointed out that “iddirs are used as the bank of the poor (credit scheme associations) in times of emergencies such as sickness, wedding ceremonies, renovation of houses, etc.” (Abraham 2003). This argument might be applicable to men’s iddirs (probably the unit of analysis in Abraham’s study was men’s iddirs), but not oftenest for women’s iddirs, at least for majority of women participated in this study. Actually there might be significant financial assistance from women’s iddirs in the future, as they achieve financial strength. However, the interviewees and FGDs’ participants of this study rarely mentioned their iddirs’ credit scheme. Indeed, it is arguable that where women are destitute how can they save money and assist others? Also there are enough cases to substantiate that women’s iddirs are financially weak. For example, in one study a quarter of 87 women’s iddirs experienced zero balance (Tigist L: Economic analysis of social network: empirical study on selected women iddir in Addis Ababa, Unpublished). Hence, it is wrong to equate economic contributions of men’s iddirs with that of women’s.|$|R

40|$|Abstract onlyIndividual {{transferable}} quotas (ITQs) in {{multispecies fisheries}} create incentives for fishermen to avoid bycatch of species for which quota is scarce. However, when bycatch is highly uncertain, individual quota demand and prices may be volatile creating substantial financial risk for fishermen. The US Pacific Groundfish fishery recently introduced an ITQ system with low quotas for several overfished species with highly uncertain bycatch rates. Some fishery participants formed <b>risk</b> <b>pools</b> where bycatch quota is pooled and {{available to all}} <b>pool</b> members. <b>Risk</b> <b>pools</b> can reduce financial risk and transactions costs for individuals, but they also create moral hazard and adverse selection problems. We present an empirical analysis of bycatch risk that informs several issues of <b>risk</b> <b>pool</b> design including which bycatch species to include, pools size, and how to evaluate and mitigate adverse selection and moral hazard problems. The analysis suggests that <b>risk</b> <b>pools</b> can achieve substantial risk reduction and lower adverse selection and moral hazard issues by limiting the species included in <b>risk</b> <b>pools,</b> by keeping <b>risk</b> <b>pools</b> relatively small and by specifying monitorable practices that reduce expected bycatch...|$|R
40|$|Although comanagement {{is gaining}} {{increasing}} attention {{as a way}} to manage fisheries, few studies have attempted to understand quantitatively which factors of comanagement are critical for their success. This study investigates fishery comanagement regimes adopted by coastal fisheries in Japan. Utilizing a wide variety of examples of fishery comanagement nationwide, we search for key rules and measures that underlie traditional, cultural, and social aspects of comanagement. The study focuses on {{the rules of the game}} adopted by comanaging groups called fishery management organizations (FMOs). Upon examination of successful fishery comanagement cases, we found two distinctive measures: effort coordination and <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Furthermore, anecdotal evidence suggests that <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements</b> are vital supporting measure for effective effort coordination, in which case having both of these two measures rather than only either one may be the key for successful fishery comanagement. We test this hypothesis with two sets of data. One is Japans fishery census, which was published by the government and offers a large sample size but lacks information on effort coordination. Another is data from a survey designed and conducted by the authors to supplement the information on effort coordination and other self-imposed regulations. Our results show that (1) merely establishing comanaging groups such as FMOs has limited effect; (2) FMOs that establish <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements</b> earn greater revenue from their fishing efforts, particularly when such <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements</b> are combined with effort-coordination; and (3) <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements</b> and effort coordination coupled with marketing activities result in the greatest revenue.
