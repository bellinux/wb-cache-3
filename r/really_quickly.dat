25|$|Shortly {{after the}} World Twenty20, Tanvir {{was on a}} one-year break because of injuries. He missed the tour of New Zealand in November 2009, the {{controversial}} tour against Australia in January 2010. He also missed the chance to participate for Pakistan in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2010 Asia Cup, and he missed the tour of England in August 2010. He recovered from injury in October 2010 and was selected {{to participate in the}} test series against South Africa under new captain Misbah-ul-Haq. The doctors however advised rest for Sohail Tanvir to help him recuperate fully from the new injury. He completely recovered from his knee injury by December and was selected for all three formats against New Zealand. He gave insights into his injury and stated at one point he couldn't even walk and that doctors thought he would really struggle to walk. However, he recovered <b>really</b> <b>quickly</b> after that and the surgery he had in Australia in January was paid off. At the last minute of the team departing for the New Zealand tour, Tanvir was replaced because the selectors thought he was not fully fit. After missing the Twenty20 Internationals the selectors recalled Tanvir after he had proved his performance in domestic games coupled with poor performances from a depleted Pakistan bowling attack.|$|E

500|$|Santer {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a [...] "parallel universe show" [...] with new characters, where the regular characters are in the background. Yorke sought to improve the portrayal of teenagers in EastEnders and to get younger people writing for it. The ideas came together and EastEnders: E20 was created in what Yorke described as [...] "one of the quickest periods from idea to screen I've ever known." [...] Regarding the decision to create an online drama, Yorke said, [...] "People don't watch television at fixed times anymore, they use iPlayer [...] get it at their convenience and so it made sense to make a programme that [...] can specifically get at their convenience." [...] The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, added, [...] "Technology is changing and it's changing <b>really</b> <b>quickly</b> and I think it's really appropriate that the BBC is leading the way in offering online content." [...] The first series was commissioned by multi-platform commissioning executive Rosie Allimonos.|$|E

500|$|Discussing his {{decision}} to join The Young and the Restless, Burton said on The Talk, [...] "I told my manager if I can keep my family there and I can spend time with them {{and come back and}} forth, I would do that in a second. Without hesitation, CBS Daytime made that deal. <b>Really</b> <b>quickly.</b> This is crazy, but I'm just so happy to have {{the best of both worlds}} for my family, because before, I couldn't."

I don't want to work five days a week like I did at GH", he said during a TV Guide interview. The actor said he had [...] "those first-day-of-school jitters" [...] when he first arrived at the CBS building, but was welcomed by everyone. A week before Burton's debut on the series, a promotional ad aired, teasing his arrival with the slogan Daytime's Hottest Soap Just Got Hotter!.

500|$|Beyoncé {{met with}} Polachek's bandmate of Chairlift, Patrick Wimberly, who collaborated {{with her sister}} Solange Knowles {{at that time and}} went with her on tour. During the tour, Beyoncé {{expressed}} her admiration of Wimberly, adding that she would [...] "love to get in the studio some time". Wimberly later contacted Beyoncé's management, and Polachek and himself were later invited to a studio in Manhattan to work on Beyoncé self-titled fifth studio album. They stayed in the studio for a week and when the duo was asked to submit the tracks to Beyoncé's team, Polachek added one song with complete production and a missing verse she had written while being on tour in the United Kingdom. At that time, she felt that the song [...] "could be a good album track for Chairlift, but it would be incredibly sexy if Beyoncé did it". Polachek further elaborated about the differences between her version of [...] "No Angel" [...] and Beyoncé's rendition, saying, [...] "Her groove was different—my vocals were jumpier, and hers were more like panting. And in my version the synths detuned <b>really</b> <b>quickly</b> for a second; she did the same thing but with her voice. It sounds like the whole song melts." ...|$|E
500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my brother and I have a good relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out <b>really</b> <b>quickly</b> on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E
5000|$|The Really Red line up {{consisted}} of John Paul Williams on bass guitar, Ronnie [...] "U-Ron" [...] Bond vocalist/lyricist, Bob Weber on drums and Kelly Younger on guitar. <b>Really</b> Red <b>quickly</b> evolved {{into one of}} the most prominent and popular Texas punk bands of that era. Their sound developed into something unique and distinctive, while never straying too far from its loud, fast, aggressive roots. As one of the original first-generation Texas punk bands they built on the punk genre bringing all kinds of influences to bear, including the influences of Texas psychedelic stalwarts like the 13th Floor Elevators and the Red Crayola.|$|R
5000|$|... "What A Pain In The Ass It Is…" [...] is {{a scathing}} track {{although}} Reyne {{has no intention}} of unveiling just who might be the song’s unnamed protagonist. “When it started off there was someone who inspired it, in the beginning, but not <b>really,</b> It <b>quickly</b> becomes just the usual amalgam of stuff and then you make up stuff, and then it just becomes a matter of playing with the words — you start enjoying yourself just playing with the words to make little twists and turns and rhymes and things like that.

5000|$|Featherstone studied Drama at Manchester University, {{and soon}} {{discovered}} she favoured directing over acting. [...] "I <b>really</b> realised, very <b>quickly,</b> that what I {{wanted to be}} was a director, because I'm {{not a very good}} actor, and I saw people who were incredible actors, but what I was really excited about was the bigger picture, and the overall-- and putting something together," [...] she said in 2011. After her initial degree, Featherstone also did an MA in Directing at the University, in association with Manchester's Contact Theatre.|$|R
500|$|McFeely {{said the}} writing process began {{in the middle of}} 2011, around the release of The First Avenger, with him and Markus [...] "noodling on in hopes {{that there would be a}} second one and we did a lot of just {{throwing}} stuff at the wall and seeing what stuck". The first few months of writing were a back and forth process with Marvel, but after an outline was finished, the story did not change much. They opted to set the story in the present day, and, after [...] "experimenting with flashback elements for more period World War II stuff", decided to abandon the flashbacks as [...] "it became unwieldy." [...] The film would be [...] "Cap versus the world we all live in today", while averting excessive comedy regarding the hero's time displacement, as Markus considered the Captain [...] "the most adaptive man on the planet." [...] The tone would be more grounded in reality despite the advanced technology to contrast the fantasy elements from both the first Captain America and The Avengers. Despite that, the comic book origins guaranteed that the film would not have verisimilitude. This still proved a challenge in the reveal of Arnim Zola, that had to be extensively rewritten to convey how [...] "this grounded espionage paranoid thriller suddenly screeches to a halt and you switch gears <b>really</b> <b>quickly</b> with this ghost in the machine" [...] that introduces more science fiction elements.|$|E
500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call. He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, [...] "No, baby...I had {{to get off the}} phone <b>really</b> <b>quickly...</b> I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you have known for your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E

We were due to play 2 days later. Our first-ever big arena gig, it's called Sheffield Arena now. At the sound check, I was strumming away on the acoustic guitar, and our kid (Liam Gallagher) said, 'What's that you're singin'?' I wasn't singing anyway, I was just making it up. And our kid said, 'Are you singing 'So Sally can wait'.' And I was like – that's genius! So I started singing, 'So Sally can wait.' I remember {{going back to the}} dressing room and writing it out. It all came <b>really</b> <b>quickly</b> after that." [...] Noel claims that the character [...] "Lyla", from Oasis' 2005 single is the sister of Sally. In the interview on the DVD released with the special edition of Stop the Clocks, Noel also revealed that a girl approached him and asked him if Sally was the same girl as in the Stone Roses' track [...] "Sally Cinnamon". Noel replied that he'd never thought of that but thought it was good anyway.|$|E

She <b>quickly</b> realized this after Panbanisha expressed her sadness at leaving Kanzi, a male Bonobo who was her companion, out of the game of hide and seek they were playing which would upset him and make him feel left out.|$|R

When he was 14, he appeared on an episode of MTV's Fanography to talk about his obsession with Britney Spears. Stopera attended college at NYU and majored in Communications. [...] "I originally wanted to go to school for journalism because I thought it was cool or something.

60|$|It was on Christmas Eve, at night, {{the anniversary}} of Stella's death four years before. Morris {{and his wife were}} alone at the Abbey, as the Colonel had gone for a {{fortnight}} or so to Beaulieu, just to keep the house aired, as he explained. Also Lady Rawlins was there with her husband, the evil-tempered man who by a single stroke of sickness had been converted into a babbling imbecile, harmless as a babe, and amused for the most part with such toys as are given to babes. She, so Morris understood, had intimated that Sir Jonah was failing, <b>really</b> failing <b>quickly,</b> and that in her friendlessness at a foreign place, especially at Christmas time, she would be thankful to have the comfort of an old friend's presence. This the old friend, who, having been back from town for a whole month, was getting rather bored with Monksland and the sick baby, determined to vouchsafe, explaining that he knew that young married people liked to be left to each other now and again, especially when they were worried with domestic troubles. Lady Rawlins was foolish and fat, but, as the Colonel remembered, she was fond. Where, indeed, could another woman be found who would endure so much scientific discipline and yet be thankful? Also, within a few weeks, after the expected demise of Jonah, she would be wondrous wealthy--that he knew. Therefore it seemed that the matter was worth consideration--and a journey to Beaulieu.|$|R
2500|$|U2 {{originally}} {{began the}} Innocence + Experience Tour {{with the intent}} to tour in two phases, one with material primarily taken from Songs of Innocence and one with material that would eventually be from its follow-up, Songs of Experience.

[...] When asked about plans to continue the Innocence + Experience Tour after the Joshua Tree Tour 2017, the Edge said, [...] "We feel like that tour wasn't finished. So right now, we'd love to finish that tour. I would imagine it's gonna be with very similar production components... But we like that tour and that project wasn't completed. It is still alive in our minds creatively." [...] On 1 November 2017, the band officially announced the Experience + Innocence Tour as a sequel of the Innocence + Experience Tour, with concerts in North America during 2018 in support of Songs of Experience.|$|E

50|$|Blackburn {{signed for}} Wrexham in June 2010 on a two-year {{contract}} {{after a good}} spell with Aldershot. He made his debut in August 2010 in an opening day victory over Cambridge United. He would start the season in a familiar central defence position, but in a new 4-3-3 system adopted by manager Dean Saunders, Blackburn was moved to a holding midfield role, where his game <b>really</b> improved. He <b>quickly</b> became a first team regular, and a fans favourite {{with the way he}} broke play and cleared up loose balls. He scored his first goal for the club against Cambridge United on 22 January 2011, heading home after the keeper had saved a shot, this goal put Wrexham 3-0 up after only twenty minutes away from home. He was a key player in Wrexham's play-off season, perhaps being the most consistent performer in the team, however the side lost 5-1 on aggregate in the end of season play-offs to eventual runners-up Luton Town.|$|R

5000|$|As with Go, {{longtime}} singer/guitarist Keith Kane {{is largely}} absent from Burning the Days, only being credited with performing harmony vocals on the album. Scannell {{has insisted that}} Kane's minimal involvement in the recording of the album was not due to any tension between the two, explaining that Kane's limited involvement {{has been a part}} of the changing dynamics within the group that's naturally progressed though the years starting with their first album: [...] "With There and Back Again, the album was purposefully half Keith's songs and half my songs. And what <b>really</b> started happening, <b>quickly</b> as we started progressing as a band, is that my output of songs just started greatly increasing. Keith’s input started slowing down, and I think that is evident with Running on Ice." [...] Over the years Kane has always stated contentment with his role in the band, and Scannell's as frontman.

6000|$|He {{may have}} been right {{concerning}} the peacefulness of the Romans and their sobriety, and I am bound to say that I never saw any other violent scene during my stay. Sometimes I heard loud quarrelling among our cabmen, and sometimes I {{was the subject of}} it, when one driver snatched me, an impartial prey, from another. But the bad feeling, if there was <b>really</b> any, <b>quickly</b> passed, and some other day I fell to the cabman who had been wronged of me. I had not always the fine sense of being booty which I had one day on coming out of a church and blundering toward the wrong cab. Then the driver whom I had left waiting at the door seized me from the very cab of an unjust rival with the indignant cry, [...] "E roba mia!" [...] (He's my stuff!). It was not quite the phrase I would have chosen, but I had no quarrel, generally speaking, with the cabmen of Rome. To be sure, they have not a rubber tire among them, and their dress leaves much to be desired in professional uniformity. Not one of them looks like a cabman, but many of them in picturesqueness of hats and coats look like brigands. I think they would each prefer to have a fur-lined overcoat, which the Roman of any class likes to wear well into the spring; but they mostly content themselves with an Astrakhan collar, more or less mangy. For the rest, some of them will point out the objects of interest as you pass, and they are proud to do so; they are not extortionate, and, if you overpay them ever so little (which is quite worth while), they will not stand upon a matter of lawful fare. A two-cent tip contents them, one of four cents makes them your friends for life; as for a five-cent tip, I do not know what it does, but I advise the reader when he goes to Rome to try it and see.|$|R
