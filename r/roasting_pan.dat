25|$|In the Netherlands, a Dutch oven {{is called}} a , which {{literally}} translates to frying pan or <b>roasting</b> <b>pan.</b> An other name for it is sudderpan, which literally translates to 'simmerpan' or 'simmering pot'. The design most used today is a black (with blue inside) enameled steel pan, that is suitable for gas and induction heating. The model was introduced in 1891 by BK, a well known Dutch manufacturer of cookware. Cheaper and lighter in weight than cast iron, {{it proved to be}} a revolution in the kitchen. A braadpan is mainly used for frying meat only, {{but it can also be}} used for making traditional stews such as hachée. Cast-iron models exist, but are used less frequently.|$|E
25|$|According to Frank Hamilton Cushing, Native American cooking baskets {{used by the}} Zuni (Zuñi) {{developed}} from mesh casings woven to stabilize gourd water vessels. He reported witnessing cooking basket use by Havasupai in 1881. Roasting baskets covered with clay would be filled with wood coals and the product to be roasted. When the thus fired clay separated from the basket, it would become a usable clay <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> in itself. This indicates a steady progression from use of woven gourd casings to waterproof cooking baskets to pottery. Other than in many other cultures, Native Americans used and still use the heat source inside the cookware. Cooking baskets are filled with hot stones and roasting pans with wood coals. Native Americans would form a basket from large leaves to boil water, according to historian and novelist Louis L'Amour. As long as the flames did not reach above the level {{of water in the}} basket, the leaves would not burn through.|$|E

5000|$|Wall oven: Wall ovens make {{it easier}} to work with large <b>roasting</b> <b>pans</b> and Dutch ovens. A width is {{typically}} 24, 27, or 30 inches. Mounted at waist or eye level, a wall oven eliminates bending. However, it can be nested under a countertop to save space. A separate wall oven is expensive compared with a range.|$|R
50|$|A {{roasting}} rack may be {{an accessory}} part of the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan.</b> A rack may be horizontal and lay flat on the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan,</b> {{or it may be}} a standing rack that sits vertically in the pan. A standing rack is most commonly used for roasting poultry. A variation of the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> standing rack is the beer can chicken recipe.|$|E
50|$|A <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> is a {{piece of}} {{cookware}} used for roasting meat in an oven, either with or without vegetables or other ingredients. A <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> may be used with a rack that sits inside the pan and lets the meat sit above the fat and juice drippings.|$|E
50|$|A shallow <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> is {{normally}} used for roasting small cuts of meat, but large-size roasting pans {{are also used}} for cooking large poultry such as turkey or goose, or for larger cuts of meat. A deep <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> can hold vegetables and other ingredients that meat can sit on rather than a rack, letting the vegetables absorb the fat and juice from the meat while cooking. A deep <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> {{can also be used}} as a baking dish or basin, holding smaller baking dishes that must be surrounded by boiling water.|$|E

Propane is supplied by the Alpine Club via a large outdoor tank.|$|R

Drinking water is available from a small stream fed by Kiwetinok lake (a day hike) running through the meadow 60 m south of the hut. It is advisable to boil or treat the water before drinking it. In the winter you can dig down to the creek or melt snow for water.|$|R

50|$|Suet {{should not}} be {{confused}} with beef dripping, which is the collected fat and juices from the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> when cooking roast beef. Suet should also not be confused with all beef or sheep fat. It is normally the fat found around the heart and kidneys of cattle and sheep, and nowhere else in the animals.|$|E
50|$|To this {{a little}} pends (browned bits or drippings from meats or vegetables, found {{on the bottom of}} a sauté or <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> via the Maillard reaction) or stock may be added.

50|$|The Blue and Green Teams are in {{contention}} for the episode's best, and the experts quickly {{come to a}} unanimous decision. While the Blue Team certainly improved their teamwork {{a lot in the}} first challenge, they slipped back into their old ways in the third challenge, and the experts agree that ultimately, how the teams finish an episode is more important than how they start it. Therefore, it's fourth time lucky for the Green Team, whose impeccable work on the chicken coop sees them finally named the most improved couple of the week after three near-misses. For their victory, Jake and Nicole are awarded a high-end set of carving knives and <b>roasting</b> <b>pans,</b> along with a supply of whole, frozen chickens.|$|R

50|$|Covering or {{uncovering}} a <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> {{will depend}} upon the type of meat being roasted, or the recipe being followed. Generally, meat that is high in fat content, such as duck, has no need of being covered during roasting. A lean cut of meat, however, will benefit from being covered during a long roasting time, to retain juices and soften the meat (for example, in using a tajine for roasting meat).|$|E
2500|$|Braising <b>pans</b> and <b>roasting</b> <b>pans</b> (also {{known as}} braisers and roasters) are large, wide and shallow, to provide space {{to cook a}} roast (chicken, beef or pork). They {{typically}} have two loop or tab handles, and may have a cover. Roasters are usually made of heavy gauge metal {{so that they may}} be used safely on a cooktop following roasting in an oven. Unlike most other cooking vessels, roasters are usually rectangular or oval. There is no sharp boundary between braisers and roasters – the same pan, with or without a cover, can be used for both functions. In Europe, a clay roaster [...] is still popular because it allows roasting without adding grease or liquids. This helps preserve flavor and nutrients. Having to soak the pot in water for 15 minutes before use is a notable drawback.|$|R
50|$|Gardouba (γαρδούμπα) or gardoubakia (γαρδουμπάκια) is {{a smaller}} variant of kokoretsi; {{it may be}} grilled like kokoretsi, or <b>roasted</b> in a <b>pan.</b> Its name comes from the Italian caldume.|$|R
5|$|Green tea: This tea has {{undergone}} {{the least amount}} of oxidation. The oxidation process is halted by the quick application of heat after tea picking, either with steam, the method preferred in Japan, or by dry roasting and cooking in hot pans, preferred in Chinese tea processing. Tea leaves may be left to dry as separate leaves or they may be rolled into small pellets to make gunpowder tea. This process is time consuming and is typically done with pekoes of higher quality. The tea is processed within one to two days of harvesting, and if done correctly retains most of the chemical composition of the fresh leaves from which it was produced. Variation in steaming time for fixation or processing from additional stages of rolling and drying are sometimes used to improve or altering the flavour for types of green tea. Green tea leaves undergo fixation by either <b>roasting</b> (<b>panning)</b> or steaming. Generally, roasted varieties are richer in flavor, while steamed varieties are more vivid in color.|$|R
