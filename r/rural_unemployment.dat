25|$|War with France and {{population}} growth made famine an ever present danger {{in the early nineteenth}} century and there was an urgent need to maximise food production using any land that could be cultivated. In the 1820s, emigration, mostly to Canada, was promoted as a means of relieving <b>rural</b> <b>unemployment</b> and poverty. Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and Wyndham's protégé, promoted the Petworth Emigration Scheme, which sent 1,800 people from Sussex and neighbouring counties to Upper Canada between 1832 and 1837. The earl encouraged those living on his land to join the scheme by offering to pay the £10 per head cost of passage.|$|E
500|$|While {{the urban}} United States {{experienced}} an economic boom during the 1920s, {{the agricultural sector}} of the country experienced a depression. [...] Disruption of European agriculture by World War I had produced high prices for farm commodities, {{and it had been}} thought that Europe's recovery would be slow and that the high prices would persist. [...] This gave rise to a bubble in farmland prices, which burst when the rapid postwar recovery of European agriculture drove commodity prices down again. [...] At the same time, increasing mechanization reduced the need for farm labor, pushing agricultural wages downward and <b>rural</b> <b>unemployment</b> upward. [...] Madison and St. Leonard's parish suffered from this agricultural depression and from the Great Depression of the 1930s. [...] During this time, the parish's population remained more or less stable: in 1918, it consisted of 440 individuals; in 1929, 452.|$|E

50|$|The {{harvesting}} season {{extends from}} October to May. On the larger estates, the harvesting of the rhizome usually {{proceeds from the}} base of a hill towards the top. Harvesting involves breaking off the rhizome from the shoot. Planting and harvesting are inter-related in that when the rhizomes are harvested the shoot is replanted at the same time. In St. Vincent, much use is made of <b>rural</b> <b>unemployment</b> and many women workers are involved in the various phases of operation. Mechanical harvesters have recently been introduced, allowing faster arrowroot harvesting.|$|E
5000|$|Where the {{fragmentation}} of land reform had decreased agricultural efficiency, government response to the price scissors often exacerbated the problem. Any mechanization of agriculture would have meant an increase in <b>rural</b> <b>unemployment,</b> a move that, {{in combination with the}} dire conditions imposed by the Depression, would have been political suicide for any ruling regime. Thus, for example, Yugoslavia actually banned the use of tractors in the 1930s. [...] Although keeping agriculture inefficient may have kept unemployment nominally lower, it did nothing to help ease the burden on the peasantry in the long run.|$|E
