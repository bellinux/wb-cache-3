25|$|All 6-carbon sugars and disaccharides {{based on}} 6-carbon sugars can be {{converted}} by dental plaque bacteria into acid that demineralizes teeth, but sucrose may be uniquely useful to Streptococcus sanguinis (formerly Streptococcus sanguis) and Streptococcus mutans. Sucrose is the only dietary sugar that {{can be converted}} to sticky glucans (dextran-like polysaccharides) by extracellular enzymes. These glucans allow the bacteria to adhere to the tooth surface and to build up thick layers of plaque. The anaerobic conditions deep in the plaque encourage the formation of acids, which leads to carious lesions. Thus, sucrose could enable S. mutans, S. sanguinis and many other species of bacteria to adhere strongly and <b>resist</b> <b>removal,</b> e.g. by flow of saliva (although they are easily removed by brushing).

5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves {{deep into the}} realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells.

OCLP's hand was effectively forced by the turn of events, and their proclamation of the start of the civil disobedience campaign met with widespread criticism that the action was not [...] "Occupy Central". OCLP's goal from the outset was passive resistance campaign of a defined duration, after which they would surrender to the police; their plan was to not <b>resist</b> <b>removal</b> or clearance, and there is radical sentiment of students and others to resist and escalate. The scale of the protests exceeded the expectations of most people, including the groups involved, and after police manifestly failed to contain and control the gathering crowds even through use of tear gas on 28 September, demonstrators did not heed the advice of the HKFS and others to de-escalate to avoid the possibility of use of heavier weaponry.|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. November 2012. Major: History. Advisor: Brenda Child, American Studies, Jean O’Brien, History. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 287 pages. The Murder of Joe White: Ojibwe Leadership and Colonialism in Wisconsin is {{centered around the}} 1894 murder of Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe ogimaa (chief) Giishkitawag, also known as Joe White. White was the ogimaa of a community at Rice Lake, Wisconsin, 50 miles southwest of the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation. In 1894, Wisconsin game wardens Horace Martin and Josiah Hicks were dispatched to arrest White for hunting deer out of season and off reservation land. Martin and Hicks found White working in an off-reservation logging camp and {{made an effort to}} arrest him. When White took a single step back, the game officers proceeded to beat him with handcuffs and a shotgun. Then White attempted to flee, and the wardens shot him in the back, fatally wounding the leader. Both Martin and Hicks were charged with manslaughter, but later acquitted by an all-white jury. This dissertation contextualizes this event within decades of struggle of the community at Rice Lake to <b>resist</b> <b>removal</b> to the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation, created in 1854 at the Treaty of La Pointe. The community at Rice Lake was first led by White's father, Nenaa'angabi, who after being killed in battle with the Dakota in 1855 was succeeded by Joe White's brother Waabizheshi. Joe White became ogimaa when Waabizheshi was murdered in 1877 for unknown reasons by another Ojibwe. While many studies portray American colonialism as defined by federal policy, this dissertation seeks a much broader understanding of colonialism, including the complex role of state and local governments as well as corporations. All of these facets of American colonialism shaped the events that led to the death of Joe White and the struggle of the Ojibwe to <b>resist</b> <b>removal</b> to the reservation...|$|E
