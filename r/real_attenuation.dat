5000|$|Instead of light, {{this method}} employs {{ultrasound}} for collecting {{information on the}} particles that are dispersed in fluid. Dispersed particles absorb and scatter ultrasound similarly to light. This has been known since Lord Rayleigh developed the first theory of ultrasound scattering and published a book [...] "The Theory of Sound" [...] in 1878. There have been hundreds of papers studying ultrasound propagation through fluid particulates in the 20th century. It turns out that instead of measuring scattered energy versus angle, as with light, {{in the case of}} ultrasound, measuring the transmitted energy versus frequency is a better choice. The resulting ultrasound attenuation frequency spectra are the raw data for calculating particle size distribution. It can be measured for any fluid system with no dilution or other sample preparation. This is a big advantage of this method. Calculation of particle size distribution is based on theoretical models that are well verified for up to 50% by volume of dispersed particles. However, as concentration increases and the particle sizes approach the nanoscale, conventional modelling gives way to the necessity to include shear-wave re-conversion effects in order for the models to accurately reflect the <b>real</b> <b>attenuation</b> spectra.|$|E

The Generate program used in conjunction with spectra of model iron oxides allowed for both magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and maghaemite (g-Fe 2 O 3) structures to be identified in all films studied. These structures were identified as overlying layers in the oxide films andwere usually intermixed at their interface. The absence of other iron oxide structures within the film could be tested based on their goodness of fit to the experimental spectrum. Comparison of the thickness values obtained using Generate with those found using nuclear reaction analysis suggested that the Generate results were higher by 20 %.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{numerous}} attempts were considered to co-register and integrate different imaging data. Like PET/CT the integration of PET to MR showed great interest. PET/MR scanners are recently tested on different distrectual or systemic pathologies. Unfortunately PET/MR scanners are expensive and diagnostic protocols are still under studies and investigations. Nuclear Medicine imaging highlights functional and biometabolic information but has poor anatomic details. The {{aim of this study}} is to integrate MR and PET data to produce distrectual or whole body fused images acquired from different scanners even in different days. We propose an offline method to fuse PET with MR data using an open-source software that has to be inexpensive, reproducible and capable to exchange data over the network. We also evaluate global quality, alignment quality, and diagnostic confidence of fused PET-MR images. We selected PET/CT studies performed in our Nuclear Medicine unit, MR studies provided by patients on DICOM CD media or network received. We used Osirix 5. 7 open source version. We aligned CT slices with the first MR slice, pointed and marked for co-registration using MR-T 1 sequence and CT as reference and fused with PET to produce a PET-MR image. A total of 100 PET/CT studies were fused with the following MR studies: 20 head, 15 thorax, 24 abdomen, 31 pelvis, 10 whole body. An interval of no more than 15 days between PET and MR was the inclusion criteria. PET/CT, MR and fused studies were evaluated by two experienced radiologist and two experienced nuclear medicine physicians. Each one filled a five point based evaluation scoring scheme based on image quality, image artifacts, segmentation errors, fusion misalignment and diagnostic confidence. Our fusion method showed best results for head, thorax and pelvic districts in terms of global quality, alignment quality and diagnostic confidence,while for the abdomen and pelvis alignement quality and global quality resulted poor due to internal organs filling variation and time shifting beetwen examinations. PET/CT images with time of flight reconstruction and <b>real</b> <b>attenuation</b> correction were combined with anatomical detailed MRI images.

Our method allows to share patient PET/MR fused data with different medical staff using dedicated networks.

Methods: In a randomized clinical trial, 150 workers referred to occupational medicine clinic were randomly allocated to three arms—a group wearing earplugs with an NRR of 25 with no training in appropriate use of the device; a group wearing earplugs with an NRR of 25 with training; another group wearing earplugs with an NRR of 30, with no training.

Therefore, they wear hearing protectors and other personal protective equipment. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine whether simultaneous use of earmuffs and respiratory protective devices affects the attenuation of earmuffs. Material and Methods: The study was conducted in laboratory conditions using the subjective REAT (<b>Real</b> Ear <b>Attenuation</b> at Threshold) and objective MIRE (Microphone in Real Ear) methods. The REAT method was used to measure sound attenuation of earmuffs, while MIRE was used to determine changes in attenuation of earmuffs due to the use of other personal protective equipment. Results: The study showed reduction in attenuation of earmuffs due to the use of a full face mask up to 20 dB. Using a full face mask causes that attenuation of earmuffs in the low frequency range is close to zero. Reduction in attenuation due to the use of half masks for complete with particle filters (half masks) is 3 – 15 dB. Simultaneous use of earmuffs and filtering half masks makes small changes in attenuation not exceeding 3 dB. Conclusions: The study showed that full face masks give the greatest reduction in attenuation of earmuffs. On the other hand, the least reduction is observed in the case of filtering half masks. There is a significant difference between the reduction in attenuation of earmuffs worn with half masks for complete with particle filters because they may be equipped with different kind of the head strap.

40|$|Context: Damage to the {{auditory}} system by loud sounds {{can be avoided}} by hearing protection devices (HPDs) such as earmuffs, earplugs, or both for maximum attenuation. However, the attenuation can be limited by air conduction (AC) leakage around the earplugs and earmuffs by the occlusion effect (OE) and by skull vibrations initiating bone conduction (BC). Aims: To assess maximum attenuation by HPDs and possible flanking pathways to the inner ear. Subjects and Methods: AC attenuation and resulting thresholds were assessed using the <b>real</b> ear <b>attenuation</b> at threshold (REAT) procedure on 15 normal-hearing participants in four free-field conditions: (a) unprotected ears, (b) ears covered with earmuffs, (c) ears blocked with deeply inserted customized earplugs, and (d) ears blocked with both earplugs and earmuffs. BC thresholds were assessed with and without earplugs to assess the OE. Results: Addition of earmuffs to earplugs did not cause significantly greater attenuation than earplugs alone, confirming minimal AC leakage through the external meatus {{and the absence of}} the OE. Maximum REATs ranged between 40 and 46 [*]dB, leading to thresholds of 46 – 54 [*]dB HL. Furthermore, calculation of the acoustic impedance mismatch between air and bone predicted at least 60 [*]dB attenuation of BC. Conclusion: Results do not support the notion that skull vibrations (BC) contributed to the limited attenuation provided by traditional HPDs. An alternative explanation, supported by experimental evidence, suggests transmission of sound to inner ear via non-osseous pathways such as skin, soft tissues, and fluid. Because the acoustic impedance mismatch between air and soft tissues is smaller than that between air and bone, air-borne sounds would be transmitted to soft tissues more effectively than to bone, and therefore less attenuation is expected through soft tissue sound conduction. This can contribute to the limited attenuation provided by traditional HPDs. The present study has practical implications for hearing conservation protocols...|$|R

The reference material for simulation of the breast attenuation proper-ties of glandular and adipose breast tissues is manufactured by a single provider. In order to characterize the attenuation properties of these materials, measurements in Hounsfield Units (HU) have been performed using a CT-scanner. Breast-equivalent plates have been imaged in different configurations (plates in and orthogonal to image planes), providing consistent results (+ 1. 3 HU). Breast density equivalent plates of different nominal breast density equivalences and sizes were measured, demonstrating both a good homogeneity within the plates (+ 1. 8 HU) and a good consistency between plates of the same nominal breast density equivalence (+ 1. 5 HU). In addition, dual energy CT provided mono-energetic HU from which mono-energetic linear attenuation coefficients of water and glandular and adipose equivalent materials were computed.

We investigate standing kink magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in flowing prominence threads from a theoretical point of view. We model a prominence fine structure as a cylindrical magnetic tube embedded in the solar corona with its ends line-tied in the photosphere. The magnetic cylinder is composed of a region with dense prominence plasma, which is flowing along the magnetic tube, whereas {{the rest of the}} flux tube is occupied by coronal plasma. We use the WKB approximation to obtain analytical expressions for the period and the amplitude of the fundamental mode as functions of the flow velocity. In addition, we solve the full problem numerically by means of time-dependent simulations. We find that both the period and the amplitude of the standing MHD waves vary in time as the prominence thread flows along the magnetic structure. The fundamental kink mode is a good description for the time-dependent evolution of the oscillations, and the analytical expressions in the WKB approximation are in agreement with the full numerical results. The presence of flow modifies the period of the oscillations with respect to the static case. However, for realistic flow velocities this effect might fall within the error bars of the observations. The variation of the amplitude due to the flow leads to apparent damping or amplification of the oscillations, which could modify the <b>real</b> rate of <b>attenuation</b> caused by an additional damping mechanism.

40|$|Abstract This {{research}} on military aviation noise was conducted because the personnel working with military aircraft {{were concerned about}} noise induced hearing damage. In addition, comprehensive data on hearing impairments and occupational exposure of military pilots in the Finnish Air Force was not available. Moreover, data {{on the effects of}} overflight noise of military jets was necessary for the evaluation of noise induced hearing deteriorations of members of the public who might be exposured accidentally for the low-level jets' overflights. The averaged noise exposure levels of pilots varied during a flight from 97 dB(A) to 106 dB(A) in the cockpit and from 83 dB(A) to 100 dB(A) at the entrance of the ear canal. Radio noise was 4 – 10 dB higher than background noise inside the helmet. The attenuation provided by air crew helmets varied from 10 to 21 dB(A) in the laboratory, and was at the same level during <b>real</b> flights. The <b>attenuation</b> measured in the laboratory and in working conditions was about 30 dB(A) for earmuffs. An active noise cancellation (ANC) device decreased averaged noise exposure (LAeq 8 min) 4 – 8 dB over the noise attenuation of the same helmets when the ANC system was off. The noise of overflights by military jets were measured and the noise levels were lower than those known to cause the permanent threshold shifts. However, noise induced hearing damages might be possible in certain conditions. In order to assess the hearing loss risk of pilots, hearing thresholds were measured before and after one flight using both conventional and extended high frequency (EHF) audiometry. Minor temporary threshold shifts (TTS) were revealed. The risk of noise-induced damage at the studied exposure levels is, in all probability, rather small. A novel NoiseScan data management system proved to be an interesting tool in assessment of the risk of developing hearing impairment on the basis of known risk factors. Due to the small number of risk factors, the hearing of pilots was shown to be at considerably less risk than that of industrial workers in Finland...|$|R

This enhancement {{is due in part}} to the development of the ARMOR C-band dual-polarimetric radar facility (amongst other mobile radar facilities also discussed in this conference). The ARMOR radar, located at Huntsville International Airport, originated as a unique collaboration between university, government and broadcast meteorologists (the very first of its kind relative to concurrent operational, research and broadcast applications of dual-polarimetry). Contributions from each of these entities resulted in the upgrade of a surplus National Weather Service WSR- 74 C radar to a research-grade C-band polarimetric radar. The initial upgrade of the radar took place in late 2004 with WHNT-TV purchase and installation of a SIGMET (now Vaisala) Antenna Mounted Receiver (AMR), RVP 8 /RCP 8 radar processor/antenna controller, new radome, and a new dual-polarimetric antenna feed. The AMR enabled simultaneous transmit and receive (STSR) capability and hence collection of dual-polarimetric moments. During the initial part of the AMR upgrade the original WSR 74 C antenna reflector and 250 kW magnetron-transmitter were used. In early 2005, a new 350 kW magnetron transmitter was purchased from Baron Services and installed. In October of 2006 a new high performance parabolic antenna and dual-pol feed (Seavey) were installed together with a new Orbit pedestal. ARMOR Radar control and data delivery are facilitated through the use of T- 1 lines that run from the airport to both NSSTC and WHNT-TV in Huntsville. Under current operating protocols radar scanning and product development are completed at NSSTC, though meteorologists at WHNT-TV can also control the radar if desired. In its default scanning configuration the radar is operated 24 / 7 in an STSR polarimetric rain scan mode alternating with a surveillance scan on a 5 -minute cycle; scans separated by 2. 5 minutes.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of these 1 / 12 -scale scoping experiments were to  Determine {{which of the}} dimensionless parameters discussed in Bamberger and Liljegren (1994) affect the maximum concentration that can be suspended during jet mixer pump operation in the full-scale double-shell tanks  Develop empirical correlations to predict the nozzle velocity required for jet mixer pumps to suspend the contents of full-scale double-shell tanks  Apply the models to predict the nozzle velocity required to suspend the contents of Tank 241 AZ- 101  Obtain experimental concentration data to compare with the TEMPEST() (Trent and Eyler 1989) computational modeling predictions to guide further code development  Analyze the effects of changing nozzle diameter on exit velocity (U 0) and U 0 D 0 (the product of the exit velocity and nozzle diameter) required to suspend {{the contents of a}} tank. The scoping study experimentally evaluated uniformity in a 1 / 12 -scale experiment varying the Reynolds number, Froude number, and gravitational settling parameter space. The initial matrix specified only tests at 100 % U 0 D 0 and 25 % U 0 D 0. After initial tests were conducted with small diameter, low viscosity simulant this matrix was revised to allow evaluation of a broader range of U 0 D 0 s. The revised matrix included full factorial test between 100 % and 50 % U 0 D 0 and two half-factorial tests at 75 % and 25 % U 0 D 0. Adding points at 75 % U 0 D 0 and 50 % U 0 D 0 allowed evaluation curvature. Eliminating points at 25 % U 0 D 0 decreased the testing time by several weeks. Test conditions were achieved by varying the simulant viscosity, the mean particle size, and the jet nozzle exit velocity. Concentration measurements at sampling locations throughout the tank were used to assess the degree of uniformity achieved during each test. Concentration data was obtained using a <b>real</b> time ultrasonic <b>attenuation</b> probe and discrete batch samples. The undissolved solids concentration at these locations was analyzed to determine whether the tank contents were uniform (± 10 % variation about mean) in concentration. Concentration inhomogeneity was modeled as a function of dimensionless groups. The two parameters that best describe the maximum solids volume fraction that can be suspended in a double-shell tank were found to be 1) the Froude number (Fr) based on nozzle velocity (U 0) and tank contents level (H) and 2) the dimensionless particle size (dp/D 0). The dependence on the Reynolds number (Re) {{does not appear to be}} statistically significant...|$|R
40|$|This study {{combines}} cure kinetics modelling {{and thermal}} and ultrasonic cure monitoring {{to characterize the}} cure state of a complex commercial modified epoxy thermosetting system of industrial importance containing two epoxies, diethylene triamine hardener, external catalyst, aliphatic reactive diluent, and mica. Both catalyst and reactive diluent {{in the formulation of}} two epoxy resin mixture keep this complex system odd from others and to some extent a new one to report cure kinetics {{to the best of our}} knowledge. The cure was monitored using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and broadband ultrasonic techniques over a group of isothermal cure temperatures within corresponding acceptable time scales. The sensitivities of both techniques to the chemical, physical, and mechanical changes associated with each part of the cure was discussed comprehensively and critically together with an inspection of the similarities between them coupled with qualitative and quantitative correlations. An in depth details analysis of the chemical cure kinetics of the investigated system was presented utilizing the model free iso-conversional method coupled with the light of physics of advanced kinetics research. The modelling of the calorimetric cure kinetics of the epoxy system under study was developed utilizing the empirical approach of fitting of the experimental data to various kinetic models. The best fit model which best possibly describe the non-typical autocatalytic cure behaviour of the resin system and predicts the reaction course was evaluated and analyzed in details. Utilization of the maximum attained conversion at a specific curing temperature enables this model to most closely simulate the curing reaction under both chemical controlled and diffusion controlled conditions with almost a reasonable degree of satisfaction over the entire range of conversion and temperature studied without the a priori need of a glass transition temperature model. The non-conventional autocatalytic effect and prediction of the trimolecular catalysis mechanism of the curing reaction was found to be manifested in temperature dependence of reaction orders, which was elucidated and justified. In comparison to other epoxy resins without reactive diluents, the analysis of our data shows that most possibly, the reactive diluent increased the maximum value of calorimetric conversion and reaction rate, reduced the viscosity, while the values of activation energy and process parameters remained within the typical values of epoxy formulations and the crosslink density was unaffected. The performance of each particular model tested was discussed along with their comparisons. Implementing diffusion factor in conventional models some useful information associated with the diffusion controlled kinetics related to our data were explored. The cure kinetics was also analyzed from both kinetic and thermodynamic viewpoint in the context of Horie model. This approach we employed, is, to some extent uncommon, can contribute towards a new way of characterization and the critical understanding of the cure reaction from the micro• kinetic standpoint providing information of the effect of reactive diluent on kinetics, regarding reaction pathways, kinetic homogeneity / inhomogeneity associated with reaction phase and the properties of the end product which are important to monitor and ultimately control the cure to attain desired properties in the end material. A TTT diagram of the cure process of this system was also constructed. The ultrasonic compression wave velocity was demonstrated to be the most interesting and potential parameter for monitoring and characterizing the cure process at all stages which provided with the information of degree of mechanical property development and can detect gelation and vitrification that occur during cure. Therefore, ultrasonic velocity measurement could be exploited for non-destructive on-line process control in an industrial environment. It was demonstrated that ultrasonic compression wave velocity can be used as a predictor of calorimetric conversion measurements and thus can be used to track chemical reaction on• line which is of potential importance for cure monitoring. Though system specific, the methodology we utilized, at least in part, constitutes a novel way of quantifying the degree of cure of a commercial epoxy thermoset network from ultrasonic longitudinal velocity measurements which is interesting and promising. It was found that the DSC is much more sensitive to changes occurring at the early stages of the cure but is relatively insensitive to the changes occurring at the latter stage. Ultrasonic compression wave velocity shows a better sensitivity at the end of the cure. It was also demonstrated that ultrasonic compression wave <b>attenuation,</b> <b>real</b> and imaginary parts of compression modulus, ultrasonic loss tangent and associated central relaxation time, also provided information of the material state and the cure process as well. The end of cure ultrasonic data, in general, provide a convenient assessment of final product quality. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
