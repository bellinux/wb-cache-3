40|$|Inoculation {{of sugar}} cane {{seedlings}} by rubbing {{with the help}} of carborundum gave better results than needle inoculation. The extract obtained from the leaves of corn plants infected with the sugar cane mosaic virus was found to be slightly more infectious than extract from leaves of infected sugar cane field plants. Additional advantages are offered by corn plants as a source of mosaic virus for seedling inoculation in sugar cane breeding projects : the leaves are easier to ground and give more jiüce than sugar cane leaves; corn plants grow rapidly in greenhouses and can supply large amounts of inoculum within a short time; they permit multiplication of the desired virus strains; inoculum from corn minimizes the risk of carrying pathogenic bacteria or fungi as it might be the case when it is obtained from sugar cane leaves. More than 20, 000 seedlings, obtained in 1950, were tested for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> mosaic by <b>rubbing</b> with inoculum from corn, {{with the help of}} carborundum. The results were very satisfactory. Out of 21, 673 inoculated seedlings from various crosses, 9, 512 became infected, thus giving an average percentage of transmission of 43. 9. Varieties of the CP group conferred more mosaic <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the hybrid seedlings than Co's...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{the study}} is to know the effect of soda ash on rubbing {{fastness}} of reactive dyed knit fabric. To conduct this project work, twelve samples of four different structures having four GSM were taken. At first the samples were dyed with suitable recipe in a proper method. The pretreatment and after treatment of dyeing knit fabric were properly done. Then the color fastness <b>to</b> <b>rubbing</b> was tested. <b>To</b> asses color fastness <b>to</b> <b>rubbing,</b> standard procedure was followed. After critical analysis, it has been found that the color fastness <b>to</b> <b>rubbing</b> of knit fabric varies with the variation of soda ash concentration in dye bath...|$|R
