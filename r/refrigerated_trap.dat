5000|$|The {{vacuum system}} used with rotary {{evaporators}} {{can be as}} simple as a water aspirator with a trap immersed in a cold bath (for non-toxic solvents), or as complex as a regulated mechanical vacuum pump with <b>refrigerated</b> <b>trap.</b> Glassware used in the vapor stream and condenser can be simple or complex, depending upon the goals of the evaporation, and any propensities the dissolved compounds might give to the mixture (e.g., to foam or [...] "bump"). Commercial instruments are available that include the basic features, and various traps are manufactured to insert between the evaporation flask and the vapor duct. Modern equipment often adds features such as digital control of vacuum, digital display of temperature and rotational speed, and vapor temperature sensing.|$|E

Internal physiological disorders such as grey pulp, pulp spot and vascular browning as well as pitting and blackening of the rind (cold damage) are associated with cold storage. Moisture loss as a possible cause of cold damage was investigated. Moisture was rapidly extracted from late season 'Fuerte' fruits by placing them in sealed jars connected to a vacuum pump and a <b>refrigerated</b> condensation <b>trap.</b> A vacuum was applied and three different levels of moisture were removed, namely 2 %, 4 % and 6 % by mass, where after the fruit was stored at 5. 5 Â°C for four weeks. Fruit from all three treatments developed cold damage symptoms, the severity of which increased with increasing levels of moisture loss. In some fruit, a 6 % moisture loss produced brown pits around the lenticels before fruit were placed in cold storage. The severity of the symptoms on these fruits increased once they were placed in cold storage. When the fruit was eating ripe, no internal physiological disorders were observed but anthracnose infection was high. These results suggest that cold damage {{occurs as a result}} of moisture loss during or prior to cold storage...|$|R
