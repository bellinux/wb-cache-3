By 2000, {{the threat posed by}} cross-border rebels was much <b>reduced</b> <b>and</b> when Bizimungu resigned, Kagame decided to seek the presidency himself. The transitional constitution was still in effect, which meant the president was elected by government ministers and the national assembly rather than by a direct election.|$|E

He liberalised property laws, ended seigneurial dues, abolished the guild of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised divorce, closed the Jewish ghettos and made Jews equal to everyone else. The Inquisition ended as did the Holy Roman Empire. The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply <b>reduced</b> <b>and</b> equality under the law was proclaimed for all men.|$|E

5|$|A {{plea for}} a review by the Constitutional Tribunal was sought as a last-ditch attempt {{to stave off the}} {{execution}} of drug trafficker Shanmugam Murugesu. Shanmugam's lawyer contended that his client's right to equal protection under Article 12 of the Constitution had been infringed. Referring to cases of six recent offenders similarly convicted under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Shanmugam's lawyer drew {{attention to the fact that}} those offenders had imported more than 700grammes of cannabis, an offence which attracted the death penalty, but were eventually charged with possessing less than 500grammes of cannabis which resulted only in a jail sentence. In contrast, Shanmugam, who had imported 1,029.8grammes of cannabis, did not have the amount <b>reduced</b> <b>and</b> was sentenced to death. The plea was rejected by the President on 12 May 2005, one day before the execution date.|$|E
5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been <b>reduced</b> <b>and</b> employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|Around 1812 Lambert Rosey, {{a member}} of the Terrouanne family, {{demolished}} the building's north wing. In 1832, Rosey sold the building to Amédée Naudin for 12,000 francs. Work began in the east wing, with its depth <b>reduced</b> <b>and</b> its layout becoming more irregular. Naudin died on 21 November 1864, and his two daughters sold the residence on 5 June 1866 for 40,000 francs. From 1868 to 1869, it was restored under the direction of Félix Duban; in 1877, further restoration work was planned but not done.|$|E

5|$|As U.S. troop {{withdrawals}} continued, conscription was <b>reduced</b> <b>and</b> in 1973 ended; {{the armed}} forces became all-volunteer. After years of fighting, the Paris Peace Accords were signed {{at the beginning of}} 1973. The agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining American troops without requiring the 160,000 North Vietnam Army regulars located in the South to withdraw. Once American combat support ended, there was a brief truce, before fighting broke out again. North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam in 1975.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of construction, the {{railways}} provided a leap in transport for the communities it passed through. NSB saw beautiful and grandeur stations {{as a way to}} draw patronage, and chose, in addition to impressive architecture, to build a park adjacent each stations. As construction went by, funding for stations were reduced, resulting in less grandeur further north. Most stations had two stories and an attic, although some of the stations serving lesser places had smaller buildings. From Steinkjer to Skogn, the ground floors were built in random rubble. As construction continued, budgets were <b>reduced</b> <b>and</b> station costs were cut. From Rinnan to Sparbu, the ground floors were instead built in brick, and from Mære and north, the stations have wooden ground floors. In addition to a station buildings, stations consisted of an outhouse and a freight house; selected stations also featured a water tower and motive power depot.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the {{government}} was spending NOK 1.4 billion annually on purchasing passenger transport from NSB. By introducing PSO, Skogsholm stated that she hoped the costs would be <b>reduced,</b> <b>and</b> that quality and safety levels would remain, or even improve. The counties {{have been allowed to}} issue PSO contracts on bus transport since 1994; and Skogsholm saw the competition in rail transport as a continuation of this. Following the announcement of the competition, CEO of NSB, Einar Enger, said that he did not see competition as a threat, but instead that NSB would introduce means to rationalize costs. In November 2002, NSB laid off 100 employees, and reduced its administration by a third. The administration of all local and regional trains was reallocated to Oslo. Skogsholm stated that {{the government}} had no plans to sell NSB.|$|E

5|$|Between 1951 and 1960 a {{national}} service scheme had operated and {{during this time}} the CMF's numbers remained reasonably steady. However, in 1960 the scheme was suspended and the Australian Army was reorganised {{with the introduction of}} the Pentropic divisional structure. As a result of this the CMF was greatly <b>reduced</b> <b>and</b> 14 infantry battalions were disbanded altogether, while many others were amalgamated into the battalions of the six sequentially numbered multi-battalion State-based regiments. As a result of this, on 1 July 1960, the 2nd Battalion became part of the Royal New South Wales Regiment, and was reduced to a company-sized element of the Pentropic 2nd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (2 RNSWR), forming 'C' Company (City of Newcastle Company). Just prior to this, on 30 April 1960, the battalion had been afforded the Freedom of the City of Newcastle.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{vary greatly}} in overall shape. Some, {{such as the}} cockles, have shells that are nearly globular; cockles can jump by bending and {{straightening}} their foot. Others, such as the razor clams, are burrowing specialists with elongated shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much <b>reduced</b> <b>and</b> restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.|$|E

5|$|Early {{stripline}} directly coupled resonator filters were end-coupled, but {{the length}} was <b>reduced</b> <b>and</b> the compactness successively increased {{with the introduction}} of parallel-coupled line filters, interdigital filters, and comb-line filters. Much of this work was published by the group at Stanford led by George Matthaei, and also including Leo Young mentioned above, in a landmark book which still today serves as a reference for circuit designers. The hairpin filter was first described in 1972. By the 1970s, most of the filter topologies in common use today had been described. More recent research has concentrated on new or variant mathematical classes of the filters, such as pseudo-elliptic, while still using the same basic topologies, or with alternative implementation technologies such as suspended stripline and finline.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{geothermal}} {{power is}} globally sustainable, extraction {{must still be}} monitored to avoid local depletion. Over the course of decades, individual wells draw down local temperatures and water levels until a new equilibrium is reached with natural flows. The three oldest sites, at Larderello, Wairakei, and the Geysers have experienced reduced output because of local depletion. Heat and water, in uncertain proportions, were extracted faster than they were replenished. If production is <b>reduced</b> <b>and</b> water is reinjected, these wells could theoretically recover their full potential. Such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites. The long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the Lardarello field in Italy since 1913, at the Wairakei field in New Zealand since 1958, and at The Geysers field in California since 1960.|$|E
