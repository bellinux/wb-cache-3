500|$|In economics, an optimum {{currency}} area, {{or region}} (OCA or OCR), is a geographical region {{in which it}} would maximise economic efficiency to have the entire region share a single currency. There are two models, both proposed by Robert Mundell: the stationary expectations model and the international <b>risk</b> <b>sharing</b> model. Mundell himself advocates the international <b>risk</b> <b>sharing</b> model and thus concludes in favour of the euro. However, even before {{the creation of the}} single currency, there were concerns over diverging economies. Before the late-2000s recession the chances of a state leaving the euro, or the chances that the whole zone would collapse, were considered extremely slim. However the Greek government-debt crisis led to former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw claiming the eurozone could not last in its current form. Part of the problem seems to be the rules that were created when the euro was set up. John Lanchester, writing for The New Yorker, explains it: ...|$|E

For example, people who lived their entire lives in a camp had the risk of fire, which would leave their band or family without shelter. After barter came into existence, more complex risks emerged and new forms of risk manifested. Merchants embarking on trade journeys bore the risk of losing goods entrusted to them, their own possessions, or even their lives. Intermediaries developed to warehouse and trade goods, which exposed them to financial risk. The primary providers in extended families or households ran the risk of premature death, disability or infirmity, which could leave their dependents to starve. Credit procurement was difficult if the creditor worried about repayment in the event of the borrower's death or infirmity. Alternatively, people sometimes lived too long from a financial perspective, exhausting their savings, if any, or becoming a burden on others in the extended family or society [...]|$|E

40|$|Two {{means by}} which {{commodity}} producers can reduce their exposure to quantity <b>risk</b> are <b>share</b> contracting and futures hedging. This paper explains the coexistence of these arrangements by showing that these will normally be complementary means of transferring <b>risk.</b> <b>Share</b> contracting by a purchaser with many producers can help diversify imperfectly correlated quantity risks. Futures contracts, on the other hand, hedge the systematic but not the idiosyncratic components of output risk. Thus, futures hedging helps to ameliorate the main disadvantage of multiple share contracting, an excessive loading of systematic risk on the purchaser.

40|$|In 2005, Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. {{released}} a development plan for {{open pit and underground}} copper and gold mining of the Oyu Tolgoi porphyry deposits in Mongolia’s Gobi desert. Ivanhoe {{refers to the}} project as the largest copper-gold development project in the world. Under Mongolian law, the national government maintains ownership of all mineral reserves, and private parties license exploration and mining rights from the government. A contract agreement {{between the government and the}} private mining company stipulates the terms of the license. The size of the state’s share in the copper deposit will be determined by the contract and the Minerals Law of Mongolia. The purpose of this project is to analyze how the contract under consideration distributes environmental risk when environmental financial assurance is included. The basis for this analysis is a cash flow model developed by Robert Conrad for the Open Society Forum Mongolia and Revenue Watch. Two new cash flow models are created by adding self insurance and environmental fund assurance schemes to the Conrad model. Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the effects of environmental damages on the relative <b>risk</b> <b>shares</b> born by the Mongolian government and Ivanhoe Mines. Under both financial assurance models, <b>risk</b> <b>shares</b> diverge as the probability that environmental damage will occur increases. <b>Risk</b> <b>shares</b> also diverge as damages increase. The sum of the standard deviations on NPV to the government and the investor is higher than the standard deviation on the NPV to the project as a whole. The results of this analysis are general with respect to the contract but independent of the environmental parameters. The results also imply that the interactions between environmental assurance and other contract terms will ultimately determine the value of the project to the parties. Given the current contract structure, any risk of environmental damages will necessarily result in a cost to the government. This risk may be unnecessary and may dampen any development benefits of the Oyu Tolgoi license...|$|R
