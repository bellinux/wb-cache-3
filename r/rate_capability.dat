50|$|If a {{standing}} wave is induced in a hemispheric resonant structure, {{and then the}} resonant structure is rotated, the spherical harmonic standing wave rotates through an angle different from the quartz resonator structure due to the Coriolis force. The movement of the outer case {{with respect to the}} standing wave pattern is proportional to the total rotation angle and can be sensed by appropriate electronics. The system resonators are machined from fused quartz due to its excellent mechanical properties. The electrodes that drive and sense the standing waves are deposited directly onto separate quartz structures that surround the resonator. These gyros can operate in either a whole angle mode (which gives them nearly unlimited <b>rate</b> <b>capability)</b> or a force rebalance mode that holds the standing wave in a fixed orientation with respect to the gyro housing (which gives them much better accuracy).|$|E

5000|$|For some {{period of}} time, {{there had been a}} {{continuing}} lobby for changing the modulation for ATSC to COFDM, the way DVB-T is transmitted in Europe, and ISDB-T in Japan. However, the FCC has always held that 8VSB is the better modulation for use in U.S. digital television broadcasting. In a 1999 report, the Commission found that 8VSB has better threshold or carrier-to-noise (C/N) performance, has a higher data <b>rate</b> <b>capability,</b> requires less transmitter power for equivalent coverage, and is more robust to impulse and phase noise. [...] As a result, it denied in 2000 a petition for rulemaking from Sinclair Broadcast Group requesting that broadcasters be allowed to choose between 8VSB or COFDM as is most appropriate for their area of coverage.The FCC report also acknowledged that COFDM would [...] "generally be expected to perform better in situations where there is dynamic multipath," [...] such as mobile operation or in the presence of trees that are moving in high winds. However, with the introduction of 5th Generation demodulators in 2005 and subsequent improvements in generations 6 and 7, the equalization span is now about −60 to +75 microseconds (a 135 microsecond spread) and has virtually eliminated multipath, both static and dynamic, in 8-VSB reception. In comparison, the equalization span in COFDM is −100 to +100 microseconds (200 microsecond spread), but the application of this much guard band space for COFDM substantially reduces its useful payload. In fact, much of Europe has adopted 1280×720p as its HD standard for DVB because of its reduced payload capacity. The introduction of DVT-T2 is meant to increase the ability of terrestrial transmissions to carry 1920×1080p content. 1920×1080i has always been part of the 8-VSB scheme from its inception, and its improved demodulators have had no effect on its innate payload capacity.|$|E

A V 2 O 5 sol was prepared by a melt-quenching method and the LiMn 2 O 4 coated with the sol was heat-treated to obtain the MnV 2 O 6 coating layer.
