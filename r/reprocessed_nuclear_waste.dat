40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste</b> {{disposal}} has existed {{since the time}} of the Manhattan Project in World War II. Although there exist a number of technological hurdles, the main cause that has consistently plagued a solution to <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste</b> has been the politics behind it. This thesis attempts to add to the political literature behind <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste</b> disposal by examining the <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste</b> disposal preferences of members of the United States House and Senate. It then compares and contrasts those preferences with a report by President Obama 2 ̆ 7 s Blue Ribbon Commission on America 2 ̆ 7 s Nuclear Future. The hope was to determine if the commission 2 ̆ 7 s recommendation, the controversial method of geologic disposal, would be an acceptable method to the Energy Committees of both houses of Congress or if there existed an alternative disposal method that found acceptance. The study 2 ̆ 7 s results found an alternative disposal method, <b>reprocessing</b> of <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste,</b> was acceptable to the Congressional committees, while there was a division of support in the committees in regards to geologic disposal. Even with these results, the lack of discussion of the issue of <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste</b> in the energy committees of Congress translated into a scarcity of data for the study. This in turn, weakens the explanatory effect of the results. However, given the weaknesses, this does not soften the importance of the study or the issue of <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste.</b> Future studies, as data becomes available, will help shed light on the preferences of members of Congress for <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste</b> disposal methods.

50|$|<b>Nuclear</b> <b>reprocessing</b> {{has been}} {{politically}} controversial {{because of the}} potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation, the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism, the political challenges of repository siting, and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle. The Obama administration has disallowed <b>reprocessing</b> of <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste,</b> citing <b>nuclear</b> proliferation concerns. Critics of reprocessing worry that the recycled materials will be used for weapons. However, it is unlikely that reprocessed plutonium would be used for nuclear weapons, because it is not weapons-grade. Nonetheless, it is possible that terrorists could steal these materials, because the reprocessed plutonium is less radiotoxic than spent fuel and therefore much easier to steal. Nuclear power plants may not even notice if plutonium was stolen. It is difficult for plants to measure within even tens of kilograms, because making measurements at that accuracy is very time-consuming; consequently, it is likely that smaller amounts of plutonium could be stolen without detection. Additionally, reprocessing is more expensive when compared with spent fuel storage. One study by the Boston Consulting Group estimated that reprocessing is six percent more expensive than spent fuel storage while another study by the Kennedy School of Government stated that reprocessing is 100 percent more expensive.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the emergence of sustainable decommissioning practice for buildings situated on nuclear sites within the United Kingdom. It reports on developments within the Civil Nuclear Sector that have enabled sustainable practices to become embedded in current business functions. The history of civil nuclear sites is traced from the 1940 's up to the present day, to provide a background to the industry. Many organisations have been involved with nuclear generation (a low CO 2 power source itself) and reprocessing of spent fuel, so the work identifies {{the question of whether or}} not this activity was viewed as sustainable. The current focus in the nuclear sector is on decommissioning the legacy of civil <b>nuclear</b> facilities and <b>reprocessing</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste.</b> It is envisaged that decommissioning may take up to 150 years to conclude. This thesis demonstrates historical examples and recent cases where decommissioning and demolition of UK Civil nuclear buildings, through following good practice has been sustainable, whereby building materials were reused or recycled, and thus reduced sentence to a registered nuclear repository. It establishes business benefit for this practice and considers environmental, social and economic factors. Descriptions of case studies are provided. The author suggests the term "sustainable decommissioning" and investigates if the phrase truly reflects the practices of those organisations who work in nuclear decommissioning. A Literature review helps to show how sustainable nuclear decommissioning has developed. By conducting interviews with key people in the nuclear industry, including deliverers, advisors and Regulators, the thesis has established the gradual development of key features of sustainability in practice on United Kingdom nuclear sites. This thesis examines one selected key feature in more detail: the extent to which best practice publications have, or are, influencing actual site practice at Sellafield; and extending to the topical issue of "free release". Addressed in particular is the extent to which knowledge of (i) Nuclear Industry Code of Practice (NICOP) and (ii) Site decommissioning: Sustainable practices in the use of construction resources (SD:SPUR) is permeating, and has potential to influence, the nuclear decommissioning industry. The thesis concludes with the author's findings on sustainable decommissioning in the nuclear industry, how it's implemented and its success and impacts on the economy, social life and the environment. The main conclusion is that decommissioning of <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste,</b> including building materials can be done sustainably and described as "sustainable decommissioning", a term not previously been identified with nuclear activities. Implementation has come from both within and outside the industry, particularly from environmental (SD: SPUR) and stakeholder (NICOP) sources. Socially, sustainable decommissioning has provided initiatives for encouraging "free release" of materials into the local community...|$|R
500|$|Plutonium {{recovered}} from spent reactor fuel poses little proliferation hazard, because of excessive contamination with non-fissile plutonium-240 and plutonium-242. Separation of the isotopes is not feasible. A dedicated reactor operating on very low burnup (hence minimal exposure of newly formed plutonium-239 to additional neutrons which causes {{it to be}} transformed to heavier isotopes of plutonium) is generally required to produce material suitable for use in efficient nuclear weapons. While [...] "weapons-grade" [...] plutonium is defined to contain at least 92% plutonium-239 (of the total plutonium), the United States have managed to detonate an under-20Kt device using plutonium believed to contain only about 85% plutonium-239, so called '"fuel-grade" [...] plutonium. The [...] "reactor-grade" [...] plutonium produced by a regular LWR burnup cycle typically contains less than 60% Pu-239, with up to 30% parasitic Pu-240/Pu-242, and 10–15% fissile Pu-241. It is unknown if a device using plutonium obtained from <b>reprocessed</b> civil <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste</b> can be detonated, however such a device could hypothetically fizzle and spread radioactive materials over a large urban area.

40|$|The Unsaturated Test Method {{has been}} applied to study glass {{reaction}} under conditions that may be present at the potential Yucca Mountain site, currently under evaluation for storage of <b>reprocessed</b> high-level <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste.</b> The results from five separate sets of parametric experiments are presented wherein test parameters ranging from water contact volume to sensitization of metal in contact with the glass were examined. The most significant effect was observed when the volume of water, as controlled by the water inject volume and interval period, was such to allow exfoliation of reacted glass to occur. The extent of reaction was also influenced to a lesser extent by the degree of sensitization of the 304 L stainless steel. For each experiment, the release of cations from the glass and alteration of the glass were examined. The major alteration product is a smectite clay that forms both from precipitation from solution and from in-situ alteration of the glass itself. It is this clay that undergoes exfoliation as water drips from the glass. A comparison is made between the results of the parametric experiments with those of static leach tests. In the static tests the rates of release become progressively reduced through 39 weeks while, in contrast, they remain relatively constant in the parametric experiments for at least 300 weeks. This differing behavior may be attributable to the dripping water environment where fresh water is periodically added and where evaporation can occur...|$|R
