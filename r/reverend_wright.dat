[...] At the Press Club, Wright said that Obama [...] "had to distance himself from me, because he's a politician." [...] He also suggested that Obama is not a regular attendee at church, and reiterated his earlier views on terrorism, HIV, and other issues. Obama held a press conference on April 29 in which he went further than he had in his Pennsylvania speech, appearing to disown the pastor himself rather than just his controversial remarks. Obama said he was [...] "outraged" [...] and [...] "saddened" [...] by Wright's comments, calling them [...] "divisive and destructive."

5000|$|I am {{outraged by}} the {{comments}} that were made and saddened by the spectacle that we saw yesterday... The person that I saw yesterday was not the person that I met 20 years ago. His comments were not only divisive and destructive, but I believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate, and I believe {{that they do not}} portray accurately the perspective of the black church. They certainly don't portray accurately my values and beliefs. And if <b>Reverend</b> <b>Wright</b> thinks that that's political posturing, as he put it, then he doesn't know me very well. And based on his remarks yesterday, well, I may not know him as well as I thought either.... What became clear to me is that he was presenting a world view that contradicts who I am and what I stand for, and what I think particularly angered me was his suggestion somehow that my previous denunciation of his remarks were somehow political posturing. Anybody who knows me and anybody who knows what I'm about knows that I am about trying to bridge gaps and I see the commonality in all people. ...After seeing Reverend Wright's performance, I felt as if there was a complete disregard for what the American people are going through and the need for them to rally together to solve these problems. ...Whatever relationship I had with <b>Reverend</b> <b>Wright</b> has changed, as a consequence of this.|$|E
50|$|Several key {{characters}} from Radio Active transferred to KYTV largely unchanged from their radio incarnations, including Mike Channel, Mike Flex, Anna Daptor and Martin Brown, who formed the central presentation team for KYTV's programmes; other characters including Anna Rabies and the Right Reverend <b>Reverend</b> <b>Wright</b> also transferred across. Phillip Pope's main character in KYTV was as the station's unnamed continuity announcer, although {{as with the}} radio series he (and the other regulars) appeared in multiple roles.

5000|$|Obama {{stated that}} {{he was aware of}} Pastor Wright's {{controversial}} comments, and had personally heard [...] "remarks that could be considered controversial" [...] in Wright's church, but denied having heard the particular inflammatory statements that were widely televised during the campaign. Obama was specifically asked by Bill O'Reilly if <b>Reverend</b> <b>Wright</b> had said white people were bad, to which Obama replied that he hadn't. In his book Dreams from my Father, Obama had quoted <b>Reverend</b> <b>Wright</b> as saying in a sermon [...] "It's this world, where cruise ships throw away more food in a day than most residents of Port-au-Prince see in a year, where White folks' greed runs a world in need." [...] Obama said that the remarks had come to his attention {{at the beginning of his}} presidential campaign, but contended that because Wright was on the verge of retirement, and because of Obama's strong links to Trinity, he had not thought it appropriate to leave the church. He began distancing himself from Wright when he called his pastor the night before the February 2007 announcement of Obama's presidential candidacy to withdraw his request that Wright deliver an invocation at the event. A spokesperson later said, [...] "Senator Obama is proud of his pastor and his church, but... decided to avoid having statements and beliefs being used out of context and forcing the entire church to defend itself." [...] Wright attended the announcement, prayed with Obama beforehand, and in December 2007 Obama named him to the African American Religious Leadership Committee of his campaign. The Obama campaign released Wright after the controversy.|$|E

5000|$|Obama stated that—like {{other black}} churches—Trinity {{contained}} {{the full spectrum}} of the black community: [...] "the kindness and cruelty, the fierce intelligence and the shocking ignorance, the struggles and successes, the love and yes, the bitterness and bias that make up the black experience in America."
