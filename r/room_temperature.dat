5|$|Although blue phases are of {{interest}} for fast light modulators or tunable photonic crystals, they exist in a very narrow temperature range, usually less than a few kelvin. Recently the stabilization of blue phases over a temperature range of more than 60K including <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> (260–326K) has been demonstrated.

5|$|At <b>room</b> <b>temperature,</b> it is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} of the hydrogen halides except hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0°C and boils at −35.1°C. It is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate at <b>room</b> <b>temperature,</b> although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I bond dissociation energy is likewise {{the smallest of the}} hydrogen halides, at 295kJ/mol.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. HVAC systems {{account for}} 38 % of {{building}} energy usage. Studies have indicated at least 5 - 15 % waste due to unoccupied spaces being conditioned. Our {{goal is to}} minimize this waste by retrofitting HVAC systems to enable room-level zoning where each room is conditioned individually based on its occupancy. This will allow only occupied rooms to be conditioned while saving the energy used to condition unoccupied rooms. In order to achieve this goal, the effect of opening or closing air vent registers on <b>room</b> <b>temperatures</b> has to be predicted. Making such a prediction {{is complicated by the}} fact that weather has a larger effect on <b>room</b> <b>temperatures</b> than the settings of air vent registers, making it hard to isolate the influence of the HVAC system. We present a technique for dynamically estimating the heat load due to weather on <b>room</b> <b>temperatures</b> and subtracting it out in order to predict the effect of the HVAC system more directly...|$|R

5|$|The {{softness}} of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at <b>room</b> <b>temperature.</b> This {{is because the}} resistivity to electron transport in metals at <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle {{irradiation}} is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium {{and some of its}} properties, such as electrical resistivity. So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2µOhm·cm to 10µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at <b>room</b> <b>temperature,</b> due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior {{is similar to that of}} neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium, but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60K followed by saturation. The <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium.|$|E
