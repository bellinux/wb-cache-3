500|$|Alright, Still {{received}} acclaim {{from the}} British music press. The album holds a score 79 out of 100 based on 27 critical reviews which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews", {{according to the}} music review aggregator Metacritic. The Observers Rosie Swash stated that Allen's [...] "uniquely acidic brand of pop" [...] music justified the publicity it generated and that [...] "the {{icing on the cake}} is that brutally barbed tongue". Ron Webb wrote for Drowned in Sound that the album [...] "is almost a brilliant record, easily a good one and one that promises to divide opinion like Marmite". In a review for The Guardian, Sophie Heawood stated that [...] "the album is <b>rough</b> <b>round</b> the <b>edges,</b> that amateurism serves to bring the listener in", noting that it gave the album a more personal touch. The NMEs Priya Elan remarked that [...] "with a personality this size, this isn't the last time you'll be hearing from [...] ".|$|R

50|$|Now, if one {{positions}} {{the snap}} ring with its flat side {{such that it}} is pushed into the <b>rounded</b> <b>edge</b> of the snap ring groove when load or force is applied, the flat and square edge of the snap ring will “bite” into the <b>rounded</b> <b>edge</b> of the retaining groove and as more force is applied the snap ring will distort as it rides up the <b>rounded</b> <b>edge.</b> This distortion will spread an external snap ring or compress an internal snap ring, leaving it prone to possibly being forced from the groove and releasing the part {{it is designed to}} hold.See the accompanying pictures as to how this works and how to properly orient the snap ring in the groove.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{there is}} rising demand of {{electronic}} systems with functional density for industrial and automotive applications. Those components, which are typically manufactured by overmoulding blanked metal inserts within an assembly injection process, are often exposed to rough operating conditions. Especially penetrating water {{can lead to}} a severe damage of electronic systems which are often crucial to safety. Leakage can be caused among other things by crack initiation within the polymer at sharp edges of the metal insert as a consequence of stress concentration. In order to reduce stress concentration the effect of metal inserts with <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> and the forming process to manufacture such inserts is investigated. Since typical sheet thicknesses for electronic components are 1 [*]mm and less the dimensions of the <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> are on the scale of micro features. The microforming operation of <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> is provided by open coining. The influence of varying part dimensions is investigated using FE-simulation. Furthermore, ideal rectangular insert shapes are compared to parts with sheared edge geometry. In addition the effect of <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> on stress distribution of overmoulded parts is analysed by combining resulting geometries of the forming simulation with the numerical analysis of stress distribution within the polymer...|$|R
