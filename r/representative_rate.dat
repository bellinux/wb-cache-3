The beginning shows how the WTI price influences the gasoline prices in countries such as United States, Venezuela, and France, but for Colombia the relation is not clear yet. Then the article exposes the factors used to set the price of gasoline in Colombia. Finally, it is concluded that the price of Colombian gasoline is very high and does not follow the equation proposed by the government and the factors that have the most influence on the final price are the producer income mainly affected by the WTI and the Market <b>Representative</b> <b>Rate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Rate {{adaptation}} is a {{link layer}} mechanism {{critical to the}} system performance by exploiting the multiple transmission rates provided by current IEEE 802. 11 WLANs. The key challenge for designing such an algorithm is how to select the most appropriate transmission rate under different environments. The first generation rate adaptation schemes perform poorly in a collision dominant environment {{because they do not}} differentiate frame losses caused by collision from channel degradation. The second generation schemes use RTS/CTS control frames to differentiate frame losses. However, introducing the overhead may lower network performance especially when the data frame size is small. This paper gives several guidelines on how to design an efficient rate adaptation scheme and proposes an algorithm called Advanced Rate Adaptation Algorithm (ARA). ARA is implemented along with four other <b>representative</b> <b>rate</b> adaptation schemes on a Linux-based testbed. Experiment results show that ARA outperforms other rate adaptation schemes in most scenarios...|$|E

The odour quantification technique consisted of an electronic nose, AromaScan A 32 S, and an artificial neural network. Odour concentrations determined by olfactometry were used along with the AromaScan responses to train the artificial neural network. The trained network was able to predict the odour emission rates for the test data with a correlation coefficient of 0. 98. Time averaged odour emission rates predicted by the machine-based odour quantification technique, were strongly correlated with volatile solids loading rate, demonstrating the increased magnitude of emissions from a heavily loaded effluent pond. However, {{it was not possible}} to obtain the same relationship between volatile solids loading rates and odour emission rates from the individual data. It is concluded that taking a limited number of odour samples over a short period is unlikely to provide a <b>representative</b> <b>rate</b> of odour emissions from an effluent pond.

Three different Nb Ti dipoles, without iron yokes, have achieved central fields of 8. 0, 8. 6, and 9. 1 T – all short sample performance for the conductors at 1. 8 K. in helium I, at 4. 3 K, the maximum central fields are from 1. 5 to 2. 0 T lower.

40|$|In {{the first}} step of the firing cycle used to {{manufacture}} white-firing wall tile bodies, the calcium carbonate that is added, as a source of CaO, to the clay raw materials mixture used to form these bodies needs to decompose. In order to study the kinetics of this process, a <b>representative</b> <b>rate</b> equation of the chemical reaction step of calcium carbonate thermal decomposition is needed. There is a disparity of opinions regarding the reaction order of this chemical reaction step. For this reason, it was decided to obtain a rate equation for this chemical decomposition step, using the same type and size calcite particles that are usually added to these clay mixtures in industrial practice. The present paper proposes a rate equation for this chemical reaction step. With this rate equation and the application of the "Uniform Conversion Model", an expression has been derived that relates the fractional calcium carbonate conversion, in the studied calcite particles, to residence time and operating temperature. The equation satisfactorily fits the experimental results obtained under isothermal conditions in the studied temperature range for particles smaller than 100 μm. The calcite particles studied are highly porous aggregates (smaller than 1. 1 mm) of very small single crystals (smaller than 20 μm). The experiments were conducted in the 850 - 950 °C temperature range. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{analysis}} of [11 C]flumazenil pre-clinical studies currently follows the quantitative models validated {{in the clinical}} setting. Since tracer kinetics can differ between species, [11 C]flumazenil kinetic modeling was evaluated for the rat brain. Material and Methods: 60 min [11 C]flumazenil brain PET scans with arterial sampling were performed in two groups of male Wistar rats (n= 10, tracer dose only; n= 2, pre-saturated with 330 nM of flumazenil). Time-activity curves (TACs) were generated for frontal cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, medulla and pons (reference). Next, noiseless TACs (n= 10) were simulated using an average input function and <b>representative</b> <b>rate</b> constants from animal data. A three-tissue compartment model including a compartment for non-selective binding was simulated with different levels of specific-binding (k 3 ranging from 0. 2 to 2. 6 min- 1). For animal and simulated data, distribution volume (VT) and distribution volume ratios (DVR) were calculated using one and two-tissue compartment models (1 TCM and 2 TCM) and spectral analysis (SA). Binding potential (BPND) was determined from full and simplified reference tissue models with one or two-tissue compartments for the reference (FRTM, SRTM and SRTM- 2 Ref). Parameter agreement was assessed by Spearman’s correlation and Bland-Altman plots. Akaike information criterion (AIC) {{was used to determine}} model preference. Results: 1 TCM and 2 TCM VT of regions with high specific-binding (frontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum) showed similar AIC (143 ± 7 and 148 ± 10 respectively), strong correlation (rs= 0. 99) and good agreement (0. 1 % difference). In contrast, low specific-binding regions (pons and medulla) showed worse correlation (rs= 0. 77) and agreement (17. 6 % difference), while AIC were lower for 2 TCM (134 ± 10) than for 1 TCM (161 ± 8). The pre-saturated group displayed similar results to those of low specific-binding regions. High levels of non-specific and/or non-selective binding (2 TCM VT= 2. 5 ± 0. 4) was observed in pons and affected BPND estimation by all tested reference tissue models. Simulations showed a similar pattern: 2 TCM VT demonstrated better agreement (< 8. 0 % bias) than 1 TCM for all levels of specific-binding, while 1 TCM VT demonstrated smaller bias with increasing specific-binding (from - 55. 1 % to 3. 1 %). SA generated accurate VT (< 0. 9 % bias) for all specific-binding levels. 1 TCM DVRs resulted in the largest BPND overestimation (up to 58 % bias), while SRTM- 2 Ref showed an overall smaller bias (< 1. 5 %). Conclusion: [11 C]flumazenil kinetics in rats was substantially different from that in humans, especially in low specific-binding regions. In those, the 2 TCM is preferred and the standard 1 TCM and SRTM can lead to major errors in parameter estimation. Instead, models which can better account for non-specific and/or non-selective binding should be used, such as 2 TCM or SA...|$|E

40|$|To obtain {{more and}} {{accurate}} biogenic {{volatile organic compound}} (BVOC) emission rates for more plant species in China and further improve the accuracy of emission rates used in BVOC emission inventories, we conducted field measurements and developed a statistical approach for estimating <b>representative</b> emission <b>rates.</b> We performed field measurements of BVOC emissions from 50 plant species at nine locations in China using our established semi-static enclosure system. The emissions of 102 VOCs, including isoprene, α -pinene, β -pinene, and other VOC species, were analyzed with a custom-built online gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionization detector system. From the results, broadleaf trees were the greatest potential emitters of isoprene, while needle-leaf trees emitted more pinene. Shrubs had lower isoprene and pinene emission potentials, but higher emission potentials for other VOCs. Methyl methacrylate, isopropylbenzene, isopentane, acetone, ethane, propane, toluene, and xylene were the dominant species among other VOCs, probably with high emission intensities. Therefore, their emissions {{should be considered in}} future global and regional BVOC estimation studies. Next, we summarized our field measurements along with reported emission rates from China and abroad. The emission intensity categories were produced based on statistics, with more detailed categories, accurate emission <b>rate</b> intervals and <b>representative</b> <b>rates</b> compared to previous studies. The results showed that the BVOC emission intensities of plants displayed different categories, such as lowest, lower, low, moderate, high, higher, and highest.

The monoterpene emission <b>rate</b> intervals and <b>representative</b> <b>rates</b> were: lowest, 0. 08 – 0. 11 and 0. 1  μg C gdw − 1  h − 1; lower, 0. 17 – 0. 22 and 0. 2  μg C gdw − 1  h − 1; low, 0. 5 – 0. 7 and 0. 6  μg C gdw − 1  h − 1; moderate, 1. 2 – 1. 5 and 1. 4  μg C gdw − 1  h − 1; high, 2. 8 – 3. 3 and 3. 0  μg C gdw − 1  h − 1; and higher, 11. 1 – 14. 9 and 12. 6  μg C gdw − 1  h − 1. Using these established emission intervals, we determined the isoprene and monoterpene emission rates for 192 plant species/genera in China, including 30 dominant tree species, 149 shrub and grass genera, and 13 crop species.

Our method uses data streams, i.e. the model is updated as soon as the user introduces a new rating, providing, thus, online recommendations. Finally, we experiment and assess our method with Expedia and TripAdvisor data using root mean squared error (RMSE), Target Recall (TRecall) and Recall as evaluation metrics.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The stage-discharge {{relationship}} or rating curve at a river cross-section is a fondamental technique in hydrology employed for determining discharge from catchments. While river cross-sections are inherently variable, it generally takes {{quite some time}} for a change in cross-section to occur. Thus, where good quality data on stage and discharge are available, a stable and <b>representative</b> <b>rating</b> curve may be established. However, all too often, the natural variability is aggravated by data errors of human origin. These measurement errors occur because the routine of periodic flow measurement may be undertaken by illtrained personnel. Such errors resulting from this practice may lead to erroneous estimates of available water resources.
