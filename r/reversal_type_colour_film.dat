40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{regional}} exhibition of Kinemacolor in the UK and USA between 1909 and 1916. It considers the extent and role of Kinemacolor in the UK exhibition market. It also introduces the process's experience in the USA in contrast to that in the UK. In addition it considers more widely the extent of <b>colours</b> <b>films</b> in the UK market and the impact of Kinemacolor on demand for other indexical and non-indexical <b>colour</b> <b>films.</b> The thesis is divided into nine chapters, plus an introduction, conclusion, appendixes and bibliography. Chapter One provides an introduction to the <b>types</b> of <b>colour</b> <b>film</b> in the UK exhibition market and considers the extent of Kinemacolor and other <b>colour</b> <b>films</b> more generally. Chapter Two examines the early distribution and exhibition of Kinemacolor through the Provincial Palaces Limited circuit and the successes and limitations of this arrangement. Chapter Three assesses the distribution of Kinemacolor after Provincial Palaces Limited directly through the Natural Color Kinematograph Limited. Chapter Four considers the changing types of venues to screened Kinemacolor and why these venues were attracted to it. Chapter Five considers promotional material produced by the Natural Color Kinematograph Company Limited to consider exhibitors relationship with the process. Chapter Six looks at a number of case studies as examples of Kinemacolor in the regions. Chapter Seven look at the influence of Kinemacolor on other colour processes and proposes demand for Kinemacolor not only reflected more general interest in other colour systems but also stimulated it. Chapters Eight and Nine conclude the work by examining and comparing the distribution, exhibition and promotion of Kinemacolor in the USA. The thesis reveals the significance of the exhibition of Kinemacolor across the UK, examines the influence of distribution and exhibition issues and the impact Kinemacolor had more widely on colour and the exhibition market.

50|$|The main {{benefits}} of the Desmet method are in cost, as black and white negative film is still generally cheaper than <b>colour</b> <b>film.</b> In addition, {{the black and white}} inter-negative provides a greater archival record than <b>colour</b> <b>film,</b> since it is not subject to the same fading as the colour dyes used in modern <b>colour</b> inter-negative <b>films.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Attempts {{to shoot}} the first Indian <b>colour</b> <b>film</b> failed when the {{negative}} for Sairhandri, directed by Rajaram Vankudre Shantaram, was ruined during processing in Germany. Prabhat Film Company's [...] "Sairandhri" [...] was the first talkie film produced in Multicolour in 1933. However, its colour quality was not satisfactory {{and what could be}} seen was black and white.Kisan Kanya (lit: the peasant girl; 1937/ Dir: Moti B. Gidvani; prod. Ardeshir Irani; screenplay and dialogues: Saadat Hasan Manto) was arguably India’s first <b>colour</b> <b>film</b> to be actually released. It used the Cinecolor process. This story about rural poverty and crime did not go down well with mass audiences, so <b>colour</b> <b>films</b> did not catch the public imagination—till Aan (1953).India was thus the sixth country to have produced a colour film; at most seventh, if firmer dates about the first Soviet <b>colour</b> <b>film</b> indicate otherwise.|$|R

50|$|The use {{of modern}} <b>colour</b> <b>film</b> for the {{positive}} print is another drawback. Modern <b>colour</b> <b>film</b> stock effectively produces the required colour range by the subtractive mix of cyan, magenta and yellow dyes. These dyes {{are incapable of}} reproducing the same levels of saturation and hue {{as some of the}} single colour dyes used to <b>colour</b> the <b>film</b> in the first place, particularly primary colours such as red and green. Nonetheless, the Desmet method still offers a greater range of saturated colours than the colour inter-negative method.|$|R
