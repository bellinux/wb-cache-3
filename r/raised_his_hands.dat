25|$|In the bible, David {{refuses to}} harm King Saul, {{because he is}} the Lord's anointed, even when Saul is seeking his life. And when Saul {{eventually}} is killed in battle and a person comes to David to tell him that he helped kill Saul, David puts the man to death, even though Saul had been his enemy, because he had <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> against the Lord's anointed. Christian concepts of the inviolability of the person of the monarch have great influence from this story. Diarmait mac Cerbaill, King of Tara (mentioned above), was killed by Áed Dub mac Suibni in 565. According to Adomnan of Iona's Life of St Columba, Áed Dub mac Suibni received God's punishment for this crime by being impaled by a treacherous spear many years later and then falling from his ship into a lake and drowning.|$|E
500|$|With MiguelI {{defeated}} and in exile, and MariaII {{restored to}} the throne, Maria Amélia and her family remained in Portugal, first residing in Ramalhão Palace, {{and later in the}} Royal Palace of Queluz near Lisbon. But the war had taken its toll on Pedro's health, and he was dying of tuberculosis. Maria Amélia, who was not yet three years old, was taken during the early hours of 24 September 1834 to Pedro's deathbed. Very weak, Pedro <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to bless her and said: [...] "Always tell this child of the father who loved her so dearly... not to forget me... always to obey her mother... those are my last wishes". Pedro died in the early afternoon of the same day.|$|E

Immediately after the shooting, Mehserle {{appeared}} surprised and <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to his face; according to Michael Rains, Mehserle's criminal defense attorney, several eyewitnesses described Mehserle as looking stunned. Several witnesses say Mehserle said [...] "Oh my God!" [...] several times after the shooting. Many {{said they saw}} him put {{his hands to his}} head.|$|E

Additional footage from a cell phone was presented in court showing Pirone standing over the prone Grant before the shooting and yelling: [...] "Bitch-ass nigger, right?" [...] Pirone and his attorney say he was repeating an insulting epithet that Grant had yelled at him.|$|E

Peel responded that he should go and arm himself, then return. Bull retreated to his room, quickly wrote down a {{makeshift}} will for the disposition of his property in the event of his death then took his gun. Peel waited in the saloon, but after an hour he though that Bull had already fled from his challenge, and therefore left.|$|E

It was the cause of controversy after Middlesbrough's consequent appeal was deemed as [...] "frivolous" [...] by The Football Association (FA) and extended by one more game, with the club's chairman and chief executive, and Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp, deeming this unfair and criticising The FA, contrasting it with a recent appeal by Chelsea's Michael Essien.|$|E
2500|$|Horowitz's hand {{position}} was unusual {{in that the}} palm was often {{below the level of}} the key surface. He frequently played chords with straight fingers, and the little finger of his right hand was often curled up until it needed to play a note; to Harold C. Schonberg, [...] "it was like a strike of a cobra." [...] For all the aural excitement of his playing, Horowitz rarely <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> higher than the piano's [...] His body was immobile, and his face seldom reflected anything other than intense concentration.|$|E
2500|$|President Lyndon B. Johnson {{ignored the}} report and {{rejected}} the Kerner Commission's recommendations. In April 1968, {{one month after the}} release of the Kerner report, rioting broke out in more than 100 cities following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. [...] However, in New York City, Lindsay traveled directly into Harlem, telling black residents that he regretted King's death and was working against poverty. He is credited with averting riots in New York with this direct response, even as other major cities burned. David Garth, who accompanied Lindsay that night, recalled: [...] "There was a wall of people coming across 125th Street, going from west to east... I thought we were dead. John <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> said he was sorry. It was very quiet. My feeling was, his appearance there was very reassuring to people because it wasn't the first time they had seen him. He had gone there on a regular basis. That gave him credibility when it hit the fan." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1951, a young cyclist named Jeffrey O'Brien {{would become}} {{arguably the most}} {{dominant}} champion ever. He joined Gill as a four-time champion from 1951 to 1955. His chance at making that total five {{was interrupted by a}} most unusual race in 1953. The story goes that Cycling Association officials felt O'Brien was too dominant and might affect the sport's development. They planned a stratagem involving four junior riders (under eighteen) who would receive a half-hour headstart on the seniors. O'Brien and the peloton caught all but one, the eventual winner, Clinton Castillo. The incident has become a treasured part of Belizean cycling lore. O'Brien would retire in 1955 and never race again. But a new dynasty was to emerge, featuring a team of cycling brothers, the Miguels. Edward, Arthur, John and Rudy would share 11 of the next 13 Classics between them, though not without some controversy. In 1958, John Miguel's finish with contender Duncan Vernon was ruled a dead heat, the only one in Classic history. In 1961, brother Edward thought he had the race won and <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in the air accordingly, only to be disqualified in favour of Vernon and Arthur Miguel. John won the most titles of the quartet with four, followed by Edward's three, and Arthur and Rudy with two each. Other winners during the period were Clinton Castillo in 1967 and Kenneth Sutherland. In 1971, an international participant won for the first time, Mexico's Pablo Calderon, but he won on the Northern Highway, where Cross Countries have occasionally been held. In 1972, Cayo's Anthony Hutchinson, nicknamed [...] "The Tank", demolished Calderon and the Miguels for his first title on the Western Highway, then repeated in 1973 ahead of Kenrick Halliday, then an unknown. But Belizeans were soon to know all about him. (Cycling Association retrospective) ...|$|E
