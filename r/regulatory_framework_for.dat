5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a <b>regulatory</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|E

25|$|The {{precursor}} to the TASE was the Exchange Bureau for Securities, founded in 1935 by the Anglo-Palestine Bank (which became Bank Leumi). With {{the formation of the}} State of Israel in 1948, a pressing need arose to formalize trade in securities. In September 1953, a number of banks and brokerages joined forces to establish the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, which began operations in December 1953. Ten years later, a group of members of the Exchange created the TASE Clearing House. The Clearing House also acted as the central security depository in Israel. In 1968, the Knesset passed the Securities Law (1968), which established the Israel Securities Authority, which became the modern <b>regulatory</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> the TASE and its operations.|$|E
25|$|The Water Services and Institutional Support Project, a US$30M project {{approved}} in 2007, aims to increase water service {{coverage in the}} cities of Beira, Nampula, Quelimane, and Pemba and to establish an institutional and <b>regulatory</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> water supply in smaller cities and towns. The World Bank was closely involved in the promotion of private sector participation in urban water supply through two projects. The first project (1998–2006) supported building capacity, rural water supply, water resources management, and the preparation of a new urban water supply strategy through a US$36m credit. This strategy, implemented during the second water project (2004–2009), supported large-scale civil works for urban water supply systems in five cities – Maputo (the capital), Beira, Quelimane, Nampula and Pemba through a US$75m credit.|$|E

25|$|Compared to {{the overall}} water use in Morocco, {{reclaimed}} water can only provide {{a fraction of the}} country's increasing water needs. Furthermore, there is no <b>regulatory</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> water reuse and no established system to recover the costs for reclaimed water from users. The country's largest reuse project is currently under construction in Marrakech, where reclaimed water from a 90,000 m3/day plant will be reused primarily to irrigate golf courses. The tertiary treatment and the network to distribute the reclaimed water will be financed by private investors. Redal, the utility serving Rabat, was carrying out a study in 2009 to assess the feasibility of wastewater reuse to irrigate green spaces in the city. Besides this {{there have been a few}} scattered small-scale pilot reuse projects since the 1980s, some of which have been abandoned. Among the sustainable projects is a project to irrigate golf courses in Ben Slimane that has been operating since 1997 with a capacity of 5,600 cubic meter/day. In 2009 a large reuse project was planned in Agadir to irrigate a golf course and municipal gardens with 50,000 cubic meters/day. In 2009 there were also two projects for direct, planned reuse in agriculture in Oujda and Beni Mellal. These projects are financed by the National Environmental Fund and would add a tertia2bb03c3e1; centralauth_Session=1reatment plants.
