40|$|A novel support vector {{regression}} (SVR) {{approach is}} proposed to predict protein accessible surface areas (ASAs) from their primary structures. In this work, we predict the real values of ASA in squared angstroms for residues instead of relative solvent accessibility. Based on protein residues, the Mean and median <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> are 26. 0 Angstrom(2) and 18. 81 Angstrom(2), respectively. The correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed ASAs is 0. 66. Cysteine {{is the best}} predicted amino acid (mean <b>absolute</b> <b>error</b> is 13. 8 Angstrom(2) and median <b>absolute</b> <b>error</b> is 8. 37 Angstrom(2)), while arginine is the least predicted amino acid (mean <b>absolute</b> <b>error</b> is 42. 7 Angstrom(2) and median <b>absolute</b> <b>error</b> is 36. 31 Angstrom(2)). Our work suggests that the SVR approach can be directly applied to the ASA prediction where data preclassification has been used. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the problem of optimally {{matching}} two ordered sets of 3 -D points by means of a rigid displacement. Contrary to the standard approach, where a sumof-squared-errors criterion is minimized in order to obtain the optimal displacement, we here analyze the use of ℓ ∞ [maximum <b>absolute</b> <b>error</b> (MAE) ] and ℓ 1 [sum of <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> (SAE) ] cost criteria for determining the optimal matching. Two numerically efficient (polynomial time) algorithms are developed in this paper to compute an approximately optimal solution for the MAE and SAE matching problems.

5000|$|As {{the name}} suggests, the mean <b>absolute</b> <b>error</b> is {{an average of}} the <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> , where [...] is the {{prediction}} and [...] the true value. Note that alternative formulations may include relative frequencies as weight factors. The mean <b>absolute</b> <b>error</b> uses the same scale as the data being measured. This {{is known as a}} scale-dependent accuracy measure and therefore cannot be used to make comparisons between series using different scales. The mean <b>absolute</b> <b>error</b> is a common measure of forecast error in time series analysis, where the terms [...] "mean absolute deviation" [...] is sometimes used in confusion with the more standard definition of mean absolute deviation. The same confusion exists more generally.|$|R

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} characteristics and confidence limits {{associated with the}} overall <b>absolute</b> <b>error</b> in NADP/NTN measurements are identified and quantified. Data from the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) collocated-sampler program for the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/ National Trends Network (NADP/NTN) are used to estimate the overall error of NADP/NTN measurements. <b>Absolute</b> <b>errors</b> are estimated by comparison of paired measurements from collocated instruments. Spatial {{and temporal}} differences in <b>absolute</b> <b>error</b> were identified and are consistent with longitudinal distributions of NADP/NTN measurements and spatial differences in precipitation characteristics. The magnitude of error for calcium, magnesium, ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate concentrations, specific conductance, and sample volume is of minor environmental significance to data users.

Materials and Methods. Maximum voluntary muscle contraction force (MVMCF) and accurate determinate muscle force (20 % of MVMCF) developed during an isometric contraction of elbow flexors in 90 ° and 60 ° of elbow flexion were measured by an isokinetic dynamometer in healthy subjects (MH, n= 20) and subjects after an IS during their postrehabilitation period (MS, n= 20). Results. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the isometric contraction of the elbow flexors <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> were calculated. The <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> provided information about the difference between determinate and achieved muscle force. Conclusions. There is a tendency that greater <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> generating determinate force are made by MH and MS subjects in case of a greater elbow flexors length despite presence of VFI. <b>Absolute</b> <b>errors</b> also increase in both groups in case of a greater elbow flexors length without VFI.
