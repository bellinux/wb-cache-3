40|$|The {{international}} {{maritime container}} trade, which imports {{an average of}} 19, 000 largely uninspected cargo containers to United States ports each day, {{has been identified as}} a potential avenue of attack for nuclear terrorism. Currently envisioned and deployed defensive measures that seek to detect and interdict concealed fissile material once containers have already reached a U. S. port do not adequately protect against nuclear threats due to the unique power and range of nuclear weapon effects. This thesis describes and examines a novel "ship-based" approach to container-borne fissile material detection where suites of radiation detectors with imaging capabilities are enclosed in standard, non-descript cargo containers and shipped in limited numbers aboard commercial containerships. Outfitted with communication hardware, these dedicated containerized units could provide crucial advance detection and notification of an inbound nuclear threat while the danger is still safely removed from U. S. shores. Attributes of the container shipping trade that would impact the performance and viability of the proposed ship-based approach were identified and investigated. (cont.) Average available count times, based on the duration of shipping voyages, for container imports to <b>representative</b> <b>ports</b> on the east and west coasts of the U. S. where found to be 19. 2 days and 13. 3. days, respectively. These long count times will enhance the ability of the ship- based approach to confidently detect heavily shielded and well-concealed fissile material. A distribution for the average distributed density of commercial cargo, which affects radiation attenuation between the source and detectors, was also derived and found to have a favorably low mean value of 0. 198 g/cm³. The coverage efficiency (i. e. the number of containerized units required to provide detection coverage over a given percentage of a reference vessel) variations associated with prospective modes of deployment were also investigated using Matlab- based computer simulations. Evaluated deployment strategies ranged from fully random placement of detection units to completely constrained optimal placement. Despite holding important advantages in terms of stealth, random deployment was found to require an average of between 2. 2 to 3. 3 times more detectors than optimal deployment, depending on the desired level of detection coverage. (cont.) This result suggests that some combination of random and constrained deployment might yield an optimized balance between stealth and coverage efficiency. This analysis also identified significant efficiency and deployment flexibility benefits associated with units that could detect sources at ranges equal to, or greater than, 70 ft (21. 3 m). Overall, no results were obtained that seriously challenged the potential efficacy and viability of the proposed ship-based approach. by Brett P. Broderick. Thesis (S. M.)

In 6 skin scrapings of typical mycotic lesions this was the only fungus seen a d isolated espite intensive efforts to establish the presence of other aetologic agents. Species of Alternaria have long been recognized as plant pathogens and their not infrequent allergenicity for man is now firmly established. It has also been suggested (Henrici, 1930) that they may be involved in suppurative l sions in humans but the evidence for this is inconclusive. Nevertheless, Alternaria spp. are often encountered in association with clinical materials and it is considered that the high incidence of isolations of this fungus found in routine examinations of suspected ringworm material during the past 2 years is worthy of note.

40|$|The {{city can}} be seen as a social process {{composed}} of a combined action of plans and free activities, depending by human wishes and needs. Contemporary cities are under the pressure of migratory flows and particular social transformations, as a result of globalization process. Particularly, the port cities are emblematic examples of contemporary cities where the huge flows of activities and migrants could exacerbate the social conflicts and increase the fears in urban public realm. The analysis of city from a perspective of safety is a significant characteristic of urban planning culture in contemporary society. Urban landscape is impoverished leading into a defensive shell: the crescent number of gated communities; new forms of privatization of traditional public space such as malls but also airport stations, museums, galleries (quite similar) with shops, police surveillance and cctv systems; large public spaces designed without attention in new developments which rapidly decline are only some examples. New conflicts between local population and migrants are multiplying creating a new challenge to tackle of for urban planning. So, new problems are summing up to old ones in urban public realm: in the last half century, after the Second World War, the emergent “car-society” created new feelings of unsafety simply crossing streets and squares. The enormous growth in traffic oriented urban design to give priority to motor vehicles over people and pedestrians, and the urban landscape became unattractive and inhospitable. A growing fracture between user and public space emerged in last decades. Nowadays, this fracture is amplifying caused by new feelings of unsafety towards crime, physical degrade, migrant populations and consequently new barriers (mental and physical) are rising in urban landscape. In the paper it will be presented a methodology applied to analyse contemporary urban landscape giving particular attention to safety and planning design in some case studies from city of Naples, a <b>representative</b> <b>port</b> city where flows of migrants and different activities are increasing with a consequent emerging decline of many neighbourhoods...|$|R
