50|$|The overall <b>radiation</b> <b>mapping</b> service {{based on}} the device {{consists}} of six individual steps. Step 1 involves placing the device inside the given contaminated area with a known position and orientation. This can be achieved {{in a number of}} ways including deployment by crane, robot, by an operator or (as in most cases) by a remotely operated manipulator arm. The device can be orientated either upright or upside down. Once the device has been placed in position, Step 2 involves leaving the device in-situ to enable dose uptake. Once the device has been left in-situ and has achieved a suitable dose uptake (between 2 and 5,000 rads), Step 3 involves removing the device from the contaminated area. Once clearance has been given, Step 4 involves removing the radiation sensitive core from within the collimation device, ensuring that it has not rotated or moved during the deployment period.|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} two <b>radiation</b> <b>mapping</b> algorithms {{that can}} handle different situations based on prior information of the search area. The algorithms were developed {{in the framework of}} model-driven measurement, where a world model was used to drive measurement collection, and measurements were used to update the world model. We developed and experimentally tested a robotic implementation of two Bayesian-based <b>radiation</b> <b>mapping</b> strategies in two dimensions, using a commercially available desktop mobile robot fitted with a CsI radiation sensor. Our approach for implementing the Bayesian <b>radiation</b> <b>mapping</b> algorithms was to drive the robot over each segment of the search area, in real time, according to the radiation counts collected by the sensor. Future research directions include extensions to three-dimensional mapping; exploring and characterizing the tradeoffs between time efficiency, map confidence level, and utilization of prior knowledge information; as well as the implementation of Bayesian statistics for the online update of the world model. © 2008...|$|E

When estimating insolation with satellite, we used a physical model to measure the amount of hourly based solar surface insolation.

Maps of cosmic, terrestrial natural and artificial radiation {{can be constructed}} by assembling different datasets such as ground and airborne gamma spectrometry, direct dose rate measurements, and soil/rock samples. The in situ measurements were calibrated using the soil samples taken at/around the field measurement sites, the airborne measurements {{by a combination of}} in situ, and soil/rock sample data. The radioelement concentrations (Bq/kg) were in turn converted to dose-rate (nSv/h). First, the cosmic <b>radiation</b> <b>map</b> was constructed from a digital terrain model, averaging topographic heights within cells of 2 km x 2 km size. For the terrestrial radiation a total of 1615 ground data points were available, in addition to the airborne data.

Deployment of this technology has significantly reduced labor requirements, decreased personnel exposure, and increased {{the accuracy of the}} measurements. Personnel entries into the high radiation/contamination areas was minimized for a dose savings of 30 Rem (. 3 Seivert) and a cost savings of $ 640 K. In addition, the data gathered was utilized along with historical information to estimate the amount of remaining hazardous waste in the process cells. The B Plant facility is a canyon facility containing 40 process cells which were used to separate cesium and strontium from high level waste. The cells and vessels are contaminated with chemicals used in the separation and purification processes. Most of the contaminants have been removed but the residual contamination from spills in the cells and heels in the tanks contribute to the localized high radioactivity. The Gammacam{trademark} system consists of a high density terbium-activated scintillating glass detector coupled with a digitized video camera. Composite images generated by the system are presented in pseudo color over a black and white image. Exposure times can be set from 10 milliseconds to 1 hour depending on the field intensity. This information coupled with process knowledge is then used to document the hazardous waste remaining in each cell. Additional uses for this <b>radiation</b> <b>mapping</b> system would be in support of facilities stabilization and deactivation activities at Hanford or other DOE sites.

Methods and results: Solar radiation data was retrieved from the HelioClim- 1 database, elaborated from Meteosat satellite images, using the Heliosat- 2 algorithm. Daily data was interpolated using ordinary kriging to produce horizontal solar <b>radiation</b> <b>maps</b> at a 500 m resolution.

Mean August-to-September daily irradiation values, on horizontal surface, were used to classify Bordeaux winegrowing areas in three zones: low, medium, and high solar radiation areas. This initial zoning was upscaled at 50 m resolution, applying a local correction ratio, based on 2001 - 2005 solar radiation on inclined surface analysis.
