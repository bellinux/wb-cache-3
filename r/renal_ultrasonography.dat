50|$|Ultrasound imaging of {{the kidneys}} can {{sometimes}} be useful, as it gives details {{about the presence of}} hydronephrosis, suggesting the stone is blocking the outflow of urine. Radiolucent stones, which do not appear on KUB, may show up on ultrasound imaging studies. Other advantages of <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> include its low cost and absence of radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging is useful for detecting stones in situations where X-rays or CT scans are discouraged, such as in children or pregnant women. Despite these advantages, <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in 2009 was not considered a substitute for noncontrast helical CT scan in the initial diagnostic evaluation of urolithiasis. The main {{reason for this is that}} compared with CT, <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> more often fails to detect small stones (especially ureteral stones), as well as other serious disorders that could be causing the symptoms. A 2014 study confirmed that ultrasonography rather than CT as an initial diagnostic test results in less radiation exposure and did not find any significant complications.|$|E

We evaluated whether a RI value is a predictive factor for renal progression regardless of ACEI or ARB medication in patients with moderate renal dysfunction. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 119 patients with moderate renal dysfunction that had been evaluated with <b>renal</b> duplex <b>ultrasonography</b> from February 2011 to April 2015. Moderate renal dysfunction was defined as a stage 3 to 4 CKD. Renal progression was defined as a doubling of the baseline serum creatinine (sCr), a decrease of baseline glomerular filtration rate by > 50 %, or initiation of renal replacement therapy. Results: The mean age was 64. 7 ± 11. 0 years and sCr level was 2. 1 ± 1. 2 mg/dL. The RI ≥ 0. 79 group showed a higher incidence of renal progression (P = 0. 004, log-rank test) compared with the RI < 0. 79 group, irrespective of ACEI or ARB usage. In the Cox proportional hazard model, RI ≥ 0. 79 was an independent prognostic factor after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, sCr, proteinuria, and use of ACEI or ARB (hazard ratio, 4. 88; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 06 – 22. 53; P = 0. 043).

40|$|Background: Urinary tract {{infection}} {{is one of}} the most common bacterial infections in the first two years of life and it can lead to irreversible renal scarring. Renal scintigraphy is the gold standard method for detection of renal scars. The aim of our work was to revise the cases of pyelonephritis, detect the possible predictors for renal scarring and compare those results we would have obtained if we had followed current NICE guidelines. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all patients aged under 24 months evaluated in the paediatric department and diag- nosed with pyelonephritis during a three -year period. We excluded the cases in which no renal scintigraphy was performed. Results: Of the 59 children analysed, 50. 8 % were boys and 86. 4 % were under one -year old. Escherichia coli was the predominant bacteria. <b>Renal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> showed abnormal findings in 23 patients (39 %). The incidence of renal scarring was 15. 3 %. Age, atypical urinary tract infection and abnormal <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> seem to be correlated with risk of renal scarring, although the results were not statistically significant. C -reactive protein level is significantly correlated with renal scarring risk (p= 0. 047). Working outside the NICE guidelines allowed us to catch 7 further renal scars. Conclusions: It’s arguable if renal scintigraphy must be performed in all cases of pyelonephritis diagnosed in the first 24 months of life or only when there are other risk factors for renal scarring. Age, atypical urinary tract infection, C -reactive protein level and <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> results must be taken into account in the decision to perform renal scintigraphy in a child.

40|$|Background: Angiotensin {{converting}} enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) {{may induce}} acute kidney injury (AKI). The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the role of the resistive index (RI), which reflects renal artery resistance on <b>renal</b> duplex <b>ultrasonography,</b> as a predictor of AKI in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who are prescribed an ACE inhibitor or ARB. Methods: We screened 105 CKD patients evaluated with <b>renal</b> duplex <b>ultrasonography</b> from 2008 to 2012. We excluded patients not treated with ACE inhibitor or ARB and diagnosed with renal artery stenosis. Finally, we retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 54 patients. AKI was defined as increased serum creatinine by > 30 % compared with baseline after starting ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment. Results: The mean age of the patients was 60. 5 ± 13. 0 years, serum creatinine level was 1. 85 ± 0. 85  mg/dL and 22. 2 % of the patients had AKI after the use of an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The RI (P= 0. 006) and the percentages of patients with diabetes (P= 0. 008) and using diuretics (P= 0. 046) were higher in the AKI group. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the prediction of AKI was 0. 736 (95 % confidence interval= 0. 587 – 0. 885, P= 0. 013), and RI≥ 0. 80 predicted AKI with 83. 3 % sensitivity and 61. 9 % specificity.

This renal vasoconstruction (increased renal vascular resistance) should be detectable noninvasively by Doppler ultrasonography. We studied whether <b>renal</b> Doppler <b>ultrasonography</b> detects abnormalities in patients with nonazotemic liver disease and its prognostic value for subsequent kidney status. We observed by <b>renal</b> Doppler <b>ultrasonography</b> 180 patients who had liver disease without azotemia. A simple parameter, resistive index, was derived for each subject {{on the basis of}} Doppler waveform analysis. Traditional parameters used to assess patients with liver disease were also recorded at the time of Doppler ultrasonography. Subsequent kidney outcomes were kidney dysfunction (doubling of initial creatinine level to 1. 5 mg/dl [133 Μmol/L]) or more and {{the presence or absence of}} the hepatorenal syndrome. Abnormal results of Doppler examinations (elevated resistive index) were seen in 76 (42 %) of the 180 patients. Kidney dysfunction developed in 55 % (42 / 76) of the patients with an elevated resistive index and 6 % (6 / 104) of those with normal results of Doppler study (p< 0. 00005). Hepatorenal syndrome developed in 26 % (20 / 76) of subjects with an elevated resistive index and 1 % (1 / 104) of those with a normal resistive index (p< 0. 00005).
