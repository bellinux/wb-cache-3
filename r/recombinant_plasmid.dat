50|$|B-galactosidase {{can be used}} {{to track}} the {{efficiency}} of bacterial transformation with a <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmid</b> in a process called Blue/White Color Screening. B-galactosidase is made up of 4 identical polypeptide chains, i.e it has 4 identical subunits. When B-galactosidase is separated into 2 fragments, it has the unique property of regaining enzymatic activity upon the rejoining of the inactive fragments. In the process called alpha-complementation, one of the fragments (omega) is encoded by a part of a gene of the lac operon that is found in the chromosome of the bacteria, while the other fragment (alpha) is encoded by {{the other part of the}} gene that is found in the plasmid. it is only when both parts of the gene are being expressed that both the omega and alpha fragments are produced. When both fragments are present they would come together to restore the activity of B-galactosidase. However, by placing the target gene within the locus responsible for encoding the alpha fragment, one can track the presence of the desired gene in the plasmid. When the target gene is present, the alpha-fragment gene would be inactive and the alpha fragment won't be produced. In that case B-galactosidase will not be active. When the target gene is not found in the vector, the alpha fragment gene would be active, producing the alpha fragment and allowing for B-galactosidase to gain its activity. To trace the activity of B-galactosidase a colorless analog of lactose is used, X-gal. The hydrolysis of X-gal by B-galactosidase produces galactose an a blue colored compound. Therefore, when the bacteria is transformed with the <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmid</b> B-galactosidase is inactive and the colonies appear white, but when bacteria are transformed with the original plasmid, lacking the target gene, B-galactosidase is active and the colonies appear blue.|$|E

50|$|Plasmids are {{autonomously}} replicating circular extra-chromosomal DNA. They are {{the standard}} cloning vectors {{and the ones}} most commonly used. Most general plasmids {{may be used to}} clone DNA insert of up to 15 kb in size. One of the earliest commonly used cloning vectors is the pBR322 plasmid. Other cloning vectors include the pUC series of plasmids, and a large number of different cloning plasmid vectors are available. Many plasmids have high copy number, for example pUC19 which has a copy number of 500-700 copies per cell, and high copy number is useful as it produces greater yield of <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmid</b> for subsequent manipulation. However low-copy-number plasmids may be preferably used in certain circumstances, for example, when the protein from the cloned gene is toxic to the cells.|$|E
50|$|It has {{recently}} {{become more common}} to use recombinant viruses to insert the genetic information encoding specific markers (usually protein fluorophores such as GFP) that are only expressed in cells of a certain kind. The marker gene is inserted downstream of a promoter, leading to transcription of that marker only in cells containing the transcription factor(s) that bind to that promoter. For example, a <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmid</b> may contain the promoter for doublecortin, a protein expressed predominantly by neurons, upstream of a sequence coding for GFP, thereby making infected cells fluoresce green upon exposure to light in the blue to ultraviolet range while leaving non doublecortin expressing cells unaffected, even if they contain the plasmid. Many cells will contain multiple copies of the plasmid and the fluorphore itself, allowing the fluorescent properties to be transferred along an infected cell's lineage.|$|E
5000|$|Some white colonies may {{not contain}} the desired <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmid</b> {{for a number}} of reasons. The ligated DNA may not be the correct one or not {{properly}} ligated, and it is possible for some linearized vector to be transformed, its ends [...] "repaired" [...] and ligated together such that no LacZα is produced and no blue colonies may be formed. Mutation can also lead to the α-fragment not being expressed. A colony with no vector at all will also appear white, and may sometimes appear as satellite colonies after the antibiotic used has been depleted. It is also possible that blue colonies may contain the insert. This occurs when the insert is [...] "in frame" [...] with the LacZα gene and a STOP codon is absent in the insert. This can lead to the expression of a fusion protein that has a functional LacZα if its structure is not disrupted. The correct recombinant construct can sometimes give lighter blue colonies which may complicate its identification.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{construct}} eukaryotic expression plasmids of full-length Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) genotype C genome, {{which contain}} lamivudine-resistant mutants (YIDD, YVDD) or wild-type strain (YMDD), and {{to observe the}} expression of HBV DNA and antigens [hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) ] of the <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmids</b> in HepG 2 cells. METHODS: Three HBV full-length genomes were amplified from the plasmids pMD 18 T-HBV/YIDD, pMD 18 T-HBV/YVDD and pMD 18 T-HBV/YMDD, using PCR. Three <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmids</b> were generated by inserting each of the PCR products into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA 3. 1 (+), between the EcoRI and HindIII sites. After being characterized by restriction endonuclease digestion, and DNA sequence analysis, the <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmids</b> were transfected into HepG 2 cells. At 48 and 72 h post-transfection, the levels of intracellular viral DNA replication were detected by real-time PCR, and the expression of HBsAg and HBeAg in the cell culture supernatant was determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequence analysis confirmed that the three <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmids</b> were correctly constructed. After transfecting the plasmids into HepG 2 cells, high levels of intracellular viral DNA replication were observed, and HBsAg and HBeAg were secreted into the cell culture supernatant. CONCLUSION: Eukaryotic expression plasmids pcDNA 3. 1 (+) -HBV/YIDD, pcDNA 3. 1 (+) -HBV/YVDD or pcDNA 3. 1 (+) -HBV/YMDD, which contained HBV genotype C full-length genome, were successfully constructed. After transfection into HepG 2 cells, the <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmids</b> efficiently expressed HBV DNA, HBsAg and HBeAg.

The double-stranded DNA fragments were cloned into the unique SmaI or HindIII restriction sites in the kanamycin-resistance gene of pACYC 177 (AmpR, KmR). <b>Recombinant</b> <b>plasmids</b> were picked up by colony hybridization. DNA sequencing showed that not only <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmids</b> with the expected insert were formed, but also <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmids</b> with a shorter insert. <b>Recombinant</b> <b>plasmids</b> with an insert homologous to the first 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 or all 30 b. p. of the phi X 174 origin region were thus obtained. Supercoiled plasmids containing a sequence homologous to the first 27, 28 or 30 b. p. of the phi X 174 origin region are nicked by the phi X 174 gene A protein. However, the other supercoiled plasmids are not nicked by the phi X 174 gene A protein.

One specimen {{of each type}} (pIP 218, pIP 222, pIP 226) was studied in this report. All three <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmids</b> carry the same genetic information for resistance to antibiotics (CSSuT) retained from R 162 / 3. pIP 218 retained all the other properties from F of HfrH: derepression for pilus synthesis, mobilization of the chromosome for the proximally transferred HfrH genes (thr, leu, proA), interference with T 7 propagation, and ability to be cured by acridine orange. pIP 222 retained from F of HfrH the derepression for pilus synthesis and the same polarity of chromosome transfer (thr, leu, proA), while pIP 226 retained the interference with T 7 propagation and acridine orange curing. Physical studies revealed that replication control and/or recovery of F and pIP 218 as covalent circles of deoxyribonucleic acid are similar, and are different from R 162 / 3.

Escherichia coli cultures which harbored these <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmids</b> rapidly became chloramphenicol sensitive when grown {{in the absence of}} chloramphenicol. The loss of resistance was associated with the loss of 6. 2 -kilobase (kb) segments from both plasmids.

Transposition of the 6. 2 -kb segments was demonstrated by cloning the determinants into a temperature-sensitive <b>plasmid,</b> curing the <b>recombinant</b> <b>plasmids,</b> and selecting chloramphenicol-resistant, plasmid-free clones. Southern hybridization analysis of chromosomal DNA isolated from these recA E. coli clones indicated that the 6. 2 -kb segments had transposed to different sites on the chromosome.
