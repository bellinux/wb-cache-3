In the early 1990s, the general view was that there was no precedent for moving from socialism to capitalism", and only some elderly people <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> a market economy worked. As result the view that Central, Southeastern and Eastern Europe would stay poor for decades was common.|$|E

There was little opportunity for her crew to save themselves. The ship had struck well off shore and only four men reached it - a passenger, two able seamen and an apprentice. None of the survivors <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> they actually got ashore; they heard the crash of the masts, and then felt the wreckage bumping them about in the surf.|$|E
25|$|In an oral history, Lopez-De La Cruz remembered some {{circumstances}} {{of being a}} female labor organizer. “It was very hard being a woman organizer. Many of our people my age and older were raised with the old customs where the husband rules and the wife obeys… Neighbors in Parlier were for the union, {{but they were not}} taking orders from women.” She suggested reforms to make the union more inclusive to women, for example her “suggestion” to add women to the all male ranch committee of Christian Brothers Wine Company, and her push to end a ban on women pruning, making higher paying work available to women’s crews at the Christian Brothers Wine Company. She also <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> women took the lead in volunteering for store front picket lines and engaging customers in conversations about the struggle. Aside from being an efficient and passionate organizer, Lopez-De La Cruz is remembered for her incredible wit. Many stories have survived of her ability to invoke humor and justice in situations. For example, after being red bated at a picket line at a Fresno Safeway in the mid 1960s and being asked by a white man “how do you say communists in Spanish?”, she responded “Ustedes Ganaran” (You shall win), and the man went on to passionately shout the phrase while UFW members looked on and laughed.|$|E

Also, the [...] "crossed-fishing-pole-and-rifle" [...] insignia {{that can be seen}} in Homer's garage is the same insignia that Gould's father uses for his hunting club. Homer's bar was originally the center of the episode, but became the third act when the writers came up with the renovation of Moe's bar and made it the main storyline.|$|E

500|$|In the 1980s the {{presence}} of women in rock, and in particular in heavy metal bands, was usually considered by press and fans more for glamour and sexual exploitation than for the musicianship showed. Doro Pesch {{was one of the}} few exceptions; her qualities as vocalist and songwriter in Warlock, her commitment in promoting their music and her avoidance of posturing as a sex symbol won the respect of a solid fan base in the expanding European metal scene of that period, ensuring a long string of favorable articles and covers on the principal European metal magazines. In an interview in 2006 Doro <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> [...] "we lived in paradise and had not noticed it, (...) we thought at the time, that now it goes on and on and the success would continue automatically, (...) then came the great awakening".|$|E
500|$|Machine II Machine, {{the second}} album {{produced}} by Jack Ponti, was created through the collaborative efforts of musicians {{with very different}} musical backgrounds. The result is an album that explores new grounds for Doro, bringing her sound closer to mainstream rock music. Machine II Machine was mixed by Kevin Shirley and released in 1995. It was her last studio album published by PolyGram/Vertigo, finally fulfilling the ten-year contract with the label that Warlock had signed in 1985. PolyGram did not renovate her contract and Doro entered in negotiations with other record labels. Russ Irwin and Frank Ferrer replaced respectively DiLella and Dee for the following tour. In a pause of her touring schedule in October 1995, Doro made her acting debut as a guest star on the German television soap opera Verbotene Liebe (Forbidden Love). In various interviews Doro <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> [...] "it was pretty difficult to carry on" [...] as a heavy metal musician in those years and how she was sometimes reduced to odd jobs like singing at weddings and private parties.|$|E
500|$|Chatham's Post, a {{position}} {{named after a}} Light Horse officer, was Sing's first sniping post. Biographer Brian Tate wrote, [...] "It was here that Billy Sing began in earnest his lethal occupation." [...] He set about his task with a Lee–Enfield [...]303 rifle. An account by Private Frank Reed, a fellow Australian soldier, states that Sing {{was so close to}} the Turkish lines that enemy artillery rarely troubled him. His comrades left three particular enemy positions to his attention: a trench at 350 yards (320 m) from his post, a communication sap at 500 yards (457 m), and a track in a gully at 1,000 yards (914 m). According to Reed, [...] "Every time Billy Sing felt sorry for the poor Turks, he <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> their snipers picked off the Australian officers {{in the early days of}} the landing, and he hardened his heart. But he never fired at a stretcher-bearer or any of the soldiers who were trying to rescue wounded Turks." [...] In contrast, Hamilton said in a 2008 interview, [...] "We have an anecdote where, after spotting an injured Turk, he said 'I'll put that poor cuss out of his agony' and just shot him. He was a very tough man." ...|$|E

500|$|The script posed several {{technical}} {{challenges to}} both the puppet and special effects departments of Century 21 Productions. The [...] "blurring" [...] of the structures making up the Mysteron city was accomplished by mounting a sheet of glass between the camera and the effects set, with Vaseline placed on the glass at the necessary points to create lens flare. Complex scale model shots of Captain Blue's SPV navigating the spiral structure of the Car-Vu were simplified by turning the road surface instead of the vehicle, thus eliminating the requirement to manipulate the wires (or move the camera). Since the spinning blades reduced the practicality of overhead wire control, the scenes of Spectrum Helicopter A42's dogfight with the jetpack-wearing Blue were filmed upside-down (with wires supporting {{the base of the}} helicopter model) and flipped during post-production. A sequence of the World President and Captain Brown standing on a moving walkway while undergoing security checks at the Maximum Security Building was particularly difficult to film, since it was essential that the puppet operators, working from a gantry overhead, keep pace with the speed of the conveyor belt powering the set below. The Captain Scarlet [...] "grimacing" [...] head, used for the reaction shot immediately after the reconstruction is hit by Blue's bullet, was sculpted especially by the puppet workshop for its one-off appearance in this episode. In his DVD audio commentary for the episode, Gerry Anderson <b>remembered</b> <b>how,</b> on a technical level, [...] "everything had to be perfect" [...] for the filming of the first episode of the new series.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{caused a}} {{stoppage}} {{after his first}} ball in order to sprinkle sawdust on the crease. With the second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for one with an inswinger to leave England at 2/1. However, despite the early wicket, the bowlers appeared to lack confidence in their run-up on the soggy ground. Bradman made an early bowling change and brought Johnston into the attack to replace Miller after the latter had bowled three overs for the concession of two runs. At this time, Bradman adopted relatively defensive field settings despite the early breakthrough. Bill Edrich joined Hutton and they played cautiously until the former attempted to hook a short ball from Johnston. He failed {{to get the ball}} {{in the middle of the}} bat and it looped up and travelled around [...] Lindsay Hassett took the catch just behind square leg, diving sideways and getting two hands to the ball. This left England at 10/2 as Denis Compton came to the crease. Lindwall bounced Compton, drawing an edge that flew towards the slips cordon. However, the ball continued to rise and cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton for a run, but his surprised partner was watching the ball narrowly evade the slips catchers and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who stopped the ball and waited for Compton to regain his bat and his composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to run him out. However, this sporting gesture did not cost Australia many runs because when Compton was on three, Lindwall bowled another bouncer. Compton went for a hook shot and Arthur Morris ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch. Bradman later said he had <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> Compton had been out in exactly the same position in the corresponding match at the same ground during the 1938 series. Fingleton described Morris's effort as [...] "one of the catches of the season". England were 17/3, and Crapp came in to join Hutton. At this point, Bradman began to put in place more attacking field settings. Johnston then hit Hutton on the fingers with a ball that rose sharply after pitching. Bradman took Lindwall off after 50 minutes and replaced him with Miller, who then removed Crapp, caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball duck, leaving England at 23/4. When play was adjourned for lunch with England on 29/4, Hutton was 17 while Yardley was on four. According to Fingleton, Hutton [...] "had never been in the slightest difficulty". He had played cautiously but did not seem hurried by the bowling. Miller had taken 2/3 from six overs.|$|E

2500|$|During the American Revolution, most Congregational ministers {{sided with}} the Patriots and American independence. This was largely because ministers chose to stand with their congregations who felt the British {{government}} was becoming tyrannical. Ministers were also motivated by fear that the British would appoint Anglican bishops for the American colonies. This had been proposed as a practical measure; American bishops could ordain Anglican priests in the colonies without requiring candidates for ordination to travel to England. Congregationalists, however, <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> their Puritan ancestors were oppressed by bishops in England and {{had no desire to}} see the same system in America.|$|E

[...] Prior to leaving San Francisco, Jones claimed to have bribed Moscone with sexual favors from female Temple members, including one who was underage; his son, Jim Jones, Jr., later <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> Moscone frequented Temple parties [...] "with a cocktail in his hand and doing some ass grabbing".|$|E

It is as though we stood {{at the heart of a}} maze and no longer <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> we had come there.” According to Wentz, Eiseley realized that there is nothing below a certain depth that can truly be explained, and quotes Eiseley as saying that there is [...] "nothing to explain the necessity of life, nothing to explain the hunger of the elements to become life [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] and that [...] "the human version of evolutionary events [...] perhaps too simplistic for belief." ...|$|E
