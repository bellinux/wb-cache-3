Thus, many studies model each of these phenomena, using law-based approach (most of the time differential equations) or rulebased approach (individual-based models in particular). Owing to their complex nature, aquatic {{ecosystems are}} hard to study and resist a reductionist approach. We based our model on the holarchic (non directional hierarchic) nature of the ecosystems. First, aquatic ecosystems are crossed by structuring fluxes (light radiation, mass transport, etc.) which are mainly conveyed by fluid flow. So, we propose to model these fluid flows with a multi-scale simulation detecting emergent formation and managing them on different scales. Second, a part of aquatic ecosystems are species organizations called food chain. These ones are themselves interacting complex subsystems with multi non-directional <b>retroactions</b> between them and their environment. These <b>retroactions</b> can be modeled at different levels. Thus, we propose an hybrid holarchic compartmental model. This one aims at easing the gathering of phenomenon in a multi-model, multilevel simulation for studying food chain.

To test this and provide paleoelevation estimate, we adopt a morphologic-hydrological model accounting for the hypsometry of drainage basin.

The goal {{of this study was to}} initially assess concomitant and construct validity of a newly developed set of virtual faces expressing 6 fundamental emotions (happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, or disgust).

Results. Emotions expressed by each sets of stimuli were similarly recognized, both by men and women. Accordingly, both sets of stimuli elicited similar activation of facial muscles and similar ocular fixation times in eye regions from man and woman participants. Conclusion.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the scattering by a nonlinear crystal whose depth is about the wavelength of the impinging field. More precisely, an infinite nonlinear slab is illuminated by an incident field which is the sum of three plane waves of the same frequency, but with different propagation vectors and amplitudes, in such a way that the resulting incident field is periodic. Moreover, the height of the slab is of the same order of the wavelength, and therefore the so-called slowly varying envelope approximation cannot be used. In our approach we take into account some <b>retroactions</b> of the scattered fields between them (for instance, we do not use the nondepletion of the pump beam). As a result, a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations has to be solved. To do this, the finite element method (FEM) associated with perfectly matched layers is well suited. Nevertheless, when using the FEM, the sources have to be located in the meshed area, which is of course impossible when dealing with plane waves. To get round this difficulty, the real incident field is simulated by a virtual field emitted by an appropriate antenna located in the meshed domain and lying above the obstacle (here the slab).

40|$|A {{specific}} {{attention is}} devoted to the 55 + age group when building global labour force projections regularly updated by Insee. This requires taking into account individual heterogeneity, because the impact of pension reforms on behavior is potentially very different across individuals. For instance, increasing to 62 the minimum age of eligibility, as decided in 2010, will be neutral for people who already planned to retire after this age. It will be constraining for other people, but the impact on global labour force will depend upon employment status before retirement: postponing pension claiming for individuals who have already left the labour market does not affect this labour force, at least {{as long as it does}} not change labour market behavior before retirement age. Simulating individual transitions to retirement raises however considerable problems, to which models only bring imperfect and uncertain answers. This argues in favor of scenarized projections based on alternative assumptions. We present here results based on three options offered by the Destinie 2 microsimulation model. Depending upon these assumptions, cumulated impacts of past reforms on labour force participation rates for the 60 - 64 age group range, in the long run, between 10 and 40 %, but starting from no-reform trends that are themselves very different from one scenario to the next. On the whole, after reforms, the long run labour force participation rate for the 60 - 64 group would lie within the 40 %- 50 % bracket. This corresponds to mean ages at pension claiming lying between 64 and 65 years, and to mean ages at exit from the labour force fluctuating between 61 and 63 years, depending upon possible <b>retroactions</b> on career paths before full retirement. pension reform, age at retirement, microsimulation, labour force projection...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{reflections}} on migrations and the spatial mobility of populations. Only a theoretical reflection {{allows us to}} conceptualize and to survey the interrelationships, the covariations, and the <b>retroactions</b> in their social, temporal and spatial links. It {{becomes more and more}} necessary to formulate a theory which would convey the complexity of our field of investigation. The splitting of systems into sub-systems allows us to solve the problems we face when working on different geographic and demographic scales (e. g. social and temporal scales) and to establish some kind of correlation between micro and macro-scale studies, which otherwise remain incompatible. Demogeographers are partial to the field concerning the spatial mobility of individuals, whereas demographers do not find any satisfactory theoretical model for it. This field of study can provide us with the means to define many a system. Spatial mobility is already in itself a very complex system of moves (commuting links, intra-urban migrations, out-migrations etc.) seperately organized into no hierarchy (flux, migratory spheres), intricate sub-systems within the management system of society. The demographic components, the individual behaviours, the spatial distribution and the social structures are some of these sub-systems. The different structures and internal dynamics of each subsystem as well as their retro-active effects determine the spatial mobility of populations which creates new balances but also new tensions and pertubations. One should not substitute an intellectual speculation to the understanding and description of reality. The internal consistency of the system and its apparent logic should be preferred to the probing into empirical studies. Thumerelle Pierre-Jean.

40|$|An {{attempt to}} build a global {{cognitive}} theory in Archaeology is proposed. The archaeological method {{is based on a}} three level concept : knowledge acquiring, structuring and modelling, inspired by the XIX century work of Peirce, renewed by recent developments of cognitive Sciences and used today in many fields of Social and Human Sciences, System Engineering, and recently proposed in Archaeology (DJINDJIAN 1993). The knowledge acquiring level A is the result of simultaneous and retroactive use of two mechanisms: several specific analogical processes in archaeology (contemporary analogy, ethnographical analogy, experimental analogy) and a cognitive process, general to Human Sciences. Logical objects used by archaeological reasoning are artefacts, set of artefacts (archaeological layer, dwelling structure, burial, etc.) and methodological objects (unit, sample, core, etc.). Such objects may deliver three categories of data: intrinsic data, extrinsic data and administrative data. Intrinsic data (named I) are a view of an object, resulting in the interaction between the archaeological artefact and the archaeologist who is perceiving and describing it. Intrinsic data is a knowledge of the artefact. Extrinsic data (named E) are data recording the various artefact contexts: spatial and stratigraphic localisation, links with neighbouring artefacts, environment, etc. Extrinsic data depends on the quality of archaeological excavation and recording. In all the cognitive processes, knowledge A must be associated with the archaeologist, ARCH, who is at the origin of the interaction artefact/archaeologist, the process of producing the knowledge, Pc, and the validation process Pv, controlling the reasoning: (A, ARCH, Pc, Pv). The structuring level, S, is discussed in relation with the question of enrichment of structures towards the emergence of a system, through a dedicated method called the systemic triple method (DJINDJIAN 1980) : 1. Definition of the system S; 2. Perception and description of intrinsic data I; 3. Recording of extrinsic data E; 4. Formalisation of the structuring process: intrinsic structuring (matrix artefact x intrinsic data, O x I), extrinsic structuring (occurrence or Burt matrix intrinsic data x extrinsic data, I x E); 5. Exploratory data analysis on O x I or I x E; 6. <b>Retroactions</b> on I and E; 7. Iterative enrichment by integration of new I and new E; 8. Validation (using another artefact system, a new E, etc.). The modelling level is then examined with a discussion of the limits of the formal logic in Archaeology: empirical-inductive, where “every structure is Culture”, or hypothetical-deductive methods, where “all the models are fitting well” falling in the weakness of so-called paradigmatic models. A new more restricting method is proposed, called the cognitive model method, CMM. The main features of CMM are: explicit, formalised, repetitive, stable, systemic, refutable, predictive, discursive and auditable. A general method {{to build a}} cognitive model is then given, in ten steps; some of them are already known and referenced, others are new and detailed: 1. Improving the knowledge A; 2. Discovering the structures S inside data; 3. Enrichment of structures S; 4. Systemic organisation in hierarchical subsystems; 5. Building models R; 6. Validating models R; 7. <b>Retroactions</b> for enrichment and stabilisation of the models R; 8. Model simulation for predictions; 9. Writing the archaeological discourse; 10. Auditing the discourse. The systemic organisation in hierarchical sub-systems is based on a five level system: 1. Technological know-how; 2. Economic activities: craft production, raw material supplying, subsistence resources, energy resources, buildings (dwellings, infrastructure), territory management, manufacturing, exchange and trading, etc.; 3. Social organisation: workflow, specialisation of professions, social groups, social hierarchies, family structures, community administration, defence, taxes, authority systems, etc.; 4. Symbolic sub-system: ideas and beliefs; 5. Global system. In conclusion, such approaches of methodological development are the most reliable but also the most difficult way to reach a real scientific status for Archaeology...|$|R
