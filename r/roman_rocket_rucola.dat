50|$|As an antipasto, bresaola {{is usually}} sliced paper-thin and served at room {{temperature}} or slightly chilled. It is most commonly eaten on its own, but may be drizzled {{with olive oil and}} lemon juice or balsamic vinegar, and served with <b>rocket</b> (<b>rucola,</b> arugula) salad, cracked black pepper, and freshly shaved Parmesan cheese. Bresaola is sometimes confused with carpaccio, which is made from thinly sliced raw beef (the other ingredients are the same). Sliced bresaola should be stored well wrapped in a refrigerator.|$|R
50|$|The cheese can {{be eaten}} grated with salads such as {{radicchio}} or <b>rucola</b> (<b>rocket,</b> arugula) and with spices and tomato on bruschetta. It melts well, {{and can be}} used in risotto or on polenta.|$|R

60|$|The others {{understood}} {{and went to}} work with care. In a very few minutes they had most of the fireworks pinwheels, <b>rockets,</b> <b>Roman</b> candles, flower pots and others---in their possession. Then they stuffed hay {{in the bottom of the}} box and on the top placed two pinwheels and three small Roman candles.|$|R
40|$|In Greece, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) {{have only}} been {{sporadically}} reported. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the prevalence of STEC and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 in farm animals, vegetables, and humans in Greece. A total number of 1, 010 fecal samples were collected from farm animals (sheep, goats, cattle, chickens, pigs), 667 diarrheal samples from humans, and 60 from vegetables, which were cultured in specific media for STEC isolates. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect toxin-producing colonies, which, subsequently, were subjected to a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for stx 1, stx 2, eae, rfbE (O 157), and fliC (h 7) genes. Eighty isolates (7. 9 %) from animal samples were found to produce Shiga toxin by ELISA, while by PCR, O 157 STEC isolates were detected from 8 (0. 8 %) samples and non-O 157 STEC isolates from 43 (4. 2 %) samples. STEC isolates were recovered mainly from sheep and goats, rarely from cattle, and not from pigs and chickens, suggesting that small ruminants constitute a potential risk for human infections. However, only three human specimens (0. 4 %) were positive for the detection of Shiga toxins and all were PCR-negative. Similarly, all 60 vegetable samples were negative for toxin production and for toxin genes, but three samples (two <b>roman</b> <b>rockets</b> and one spinach) were positive by PCR for rfbE (O 157) and fliC (h 7) genes. These findings indicate that sheep, goats, cattle, and leafy vegetables can be a reservoir of STEC and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 isolates in Greece, which are still rarely detected among humans...|$|R
5|$|The {{core of the}} {{gameplay}} {{is focused}} on the player's ability to make Robbit jump. Robbit can jump up to three times in mid-air, which allows him to reach extreme heights. Unlike other platform games that continue to face horizontally when the player jumps, in Jumping Flash! the camera tilts downwards when a double-jump or triple-jump is performed to allow the player to see Robbit's shadow and easily plan a landing spot. The player has the ability to shoot a low-powered laser beam at a target indicator {{in the middle of the}} screen. The player can find and use fireworks for Robbit to damage enemies. These include cherry bombs, <b>rockets,</b> <b>Roman</b> candles and spinners.|$|R
60|$|While {{we still}} gazed and enjoyed, the ruin was {{suddenly}} enveloped in rolling and rumbling volumes of vaporous green fire; then in dazzling purple ones; then {{a mixture of}} many colors followed, then drowned the great fabric in its blended splendors. Meantime the nearest bridge had been illuminated, and from several rafts anchored in the river, meteor showers of <b>rockets,</b> <b>Roman</b> candles, bombs, serpents, and Catharine wheels were being discharged in wasteful profusion into the sky--a marvelous sight indeed to a person as little used to such spectacles as I was. For a while the whole region about us seemed as bright as day, and yet the rain was falling in torrents all the time. The evening's entertainment presently closed, and we joined the innumerable caravan of half-drowned strangers, and waded home again.|$|R
60|$|My two experts {{arrived in}} the evening, and pretty well fagged, for they had {{traveled}} double tides. They had pack-mules along, and had brought everything I needed--tools, pump, lead pipe, Greek fire, sheaves of big <b>rockets,</b> <b>roman</b> candles, colored fire sprays, electric apparatus, {{and a lot of}} sundries--everything necessary for the stateliest kind of a miracle. They got their supper and a nap, and about midnight we sallied out through a solitude so wholly vacant and complete that it quite overpassed the required conditions. We took possession of the well and its surroundings. My boys were experts in all sorts of things, from the stoning up of a well to the constructing of a mathematical instrument. An hour before sunrise we had that leak mended in ship-shape fashion, and the water began to rise. Then we stowed our fireworks in the chapel, locked up the place, and went home to bed.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{potential}} property damages and bodily harm {{that can be}} caused by M-80s, civilian use of Class C fireworks—now known as consumer fireworks (class 1.4G), as opposed to display fireworks (which were Class B, and are now 1.3G)— requires a license, issued by federal authorities, for pyrotechnic devices containing a charge in excess of 50 milligrams of pyrotechnic flash powder. In 1966, M-80s and cherry bombs were restricted by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Child Protection Act of 1966. In 1975, U.S. federal regulations were passed to limit all consumer-grade fireworks available for general sale to the public in the United States to a maximum of 50 milligrams flash powder, down from a previous maximum of 200 milligrams. However Firecrackers mounted onto a rocket stick, or other aerial firework devices, such as <b>rockets,</b> <b>Roman</b> candles, and cakes etc., may still have significantly more, up to 130 mg, or more, depending on device and classification, and can be legally purchased by any American civilian citizen.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-1891, the Norwood Electric Railway {{streetcar}} {{line was}} completed between Norwood and Walnut Hills, with the route extending to a turnaround at the Mount Adams Incline. On July 4, 1891, Norwood dedicated {{the opening of}} the streetcar line with a grand celebration for the ages. Officials and residents from surrounding communities were invited. The new streetcars and prominent buildings along Montgomery Road were decorated with flags and bunting. A base ball game was played between the [...] "Norwoods" [...] and the visiting [...] "Linwoods", both of the Miami Valley League. At noon, the First Artillery Regiment fired five cannons and then presented a forty-four gun salute. The Great Western Band played [...] "America" [...] at Norwood Town Hall and politicians {{from as far away as}} California addressed the crowds. A dance was held in the evening, followed by a fireworks show of <b>rockets,</b> <b>Roman</b> candles and fountains. Officials estimated 10,000 people paid the 5-cent fare to ride the streetcar home to Cincinnati after the celebration. Some streetcar stops were crowded with as many as 500 passengers waiting for cars.|$|R
40|$|On January 1, 2012, the Michigan Fireworks Safety Act {{went into}} effect. It marked a {{significant}} change in how the state of Michigan treats the sale and use of “consumer fireworks. ” Effectively, the new statute authorizes the sale and use of <b>Roman</b> Candles, bottle <b>rockets,</b> aerials, and other fireworks that had previously been banned. Almost immediately, challenges and complaints were raised. On one side, eight fireworks vendors challenged the constitutionality of one of the law’s provisions that required such vendors to purchase insurance at an arguably unreasonable rate. The court dismissed that case, holding that it could not be said that the Act’s insurance requirement lacked a rational basis. On the other side were local municipalities that opposed the new law and immediately sought to limit its impact in their jurisdictions. For example, Warren, Michigan passed an ordinance that would prohibit the use of fireworks within 30 feet of a residential building. Though provisions of the law might need adjustment once their impact is seen, {{this is not something that}} should be done prematurely. This Comment advocates a careful, calculative approach to potential reforms of Michigan’s nascent fireworks law. Instead of changing the law, the legislature should hold off on any revisions until the law’s full impact can be seen...|$|R
