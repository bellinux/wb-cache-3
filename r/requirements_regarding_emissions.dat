40|$|In {{recent years}} {{reporting}} <b>requirements</b> <b>regarding</b> <b>emissions</b> and releases of unintentionally formed {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs) have been laid on parties to international agreements {{and members of the}} EU. Such obligations include those under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the UNECE POP and PRTR protocols and the EU PRTR regulation. The aim of this project has been to assess, whether existing knowledge and data are adequate for the Nordic countries to be able to estimate the emissions eventually to be reported. The project reveals that there is a substantial lack of knowledge related to potential sources in the Nordic countries. It also suggests that even though many of the main potential sources are the same, the relative importance of them differs between countries...|$|E
40|$|Today, crash {{simulations}} replace crash {{testing in}} the product development phase in the automotive industry. High quality simulations enable shorter product development time and higher competitiveness. However, increasing <b>requirements</b> <b>regarding</b> <b>emissions</b> and crashworthiness are demanding optimised material choice in the parts constituting the car body structure. Lightweight materials are becoming frequently used. Joining dissimilar materials is difficult using common joining techniques like spot welding. To this end, adhesive joining is currently gaining popularity not only due {{to the ability to}} join dissimilar materials, joint integrity and structural stiffness both increase by the use of adhesive joining. Moreover, the number of spot welds may be reduced in hybrid joints. In this thesis, adhesive joints are studied with respect to crashworthiness of automotive structures. The main task for the adhesive is not to dissipate the impact energy, but to keep the joint integrity so that the impact energy can be consumed by plastic work of the base materials. Fracture of adhesives can be accurately modelled by cohesive zones. The dynamic behaviour of finite element structures containing cohesive zones is studied using a simplified structure. An amplified strain rate is found in the adhesive as compared to the base material. The cohesive zone concept is used {{in the development of a}} 2 D interphase element. The accuracy and time step influence of the interphase element is compared to solutions based on continuum element representation of the adhesive. The interphase element is found to predict fracture of the adhesive joint with engineering accuracy and has a small effect on the time step of the explicit FE method. The cohesive laws for use in the material models of the adhesive have been determined using dedicated test methods. The double cantilever beam specimen and the end notched flexure specimen are used with inverse methods to determine cohesive laws in peel and shear, respectively. The cohesive laws are determined for varying temperature, strain rate and adhesive layer thickness. A built up bimaterial beam is designed for testing and simulation of joints consisting of bolts, adhesives and combinations of bolts and adhesives, i. e. hybrid joints. The model of the hybrid beam developed was found to be able to predict results from impact tests, quantified as maximum load and deformed shape of the beam...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} report is to {{investigate}} how existing Best Available Techniques (BAT) for some key systems are affected by Arctic conditions and future expected requirements in Norway. The thesis report is focusing on assessing three systems with the most planned emissions to air and discharges to sea in {{oil and gas production}} facilities; Power and Heat generation, Flare system and Produced Water system. The thesis has been conducted in cooperation with Det Norske Veritas in HÃ¸vik, Norway during spring of 2013. This report consists of two parts; the first part involves the context and general settings on the Norwegian Continental shelf and the Arctic areas. This includes the oil and natural gas industry in Norway, identified environmental impacts and Arctic conditions. The existing regulation and guidelines on the Norwegian Continental shelf have been summarized and future requirements and guidelines for the Arctic areas have been considered and assessed to as large extent as possible. The second part consists of the findings of existing BAT and expected changes due to Arctic conditions for the key systems studied. By comparing the technical constraints and the environmental requirements the alternatives have been assessed if appropriate for Arctic conditions. The findings include expectations of stricter requirements for the Arctic areas in Norway at present and, depending on case, probably even stricter in the future. This will affect the existing BAT when applied with the expected requirements and the Arctic conditions. In general there are increased requirements when it comes to discharges to sea where the target of zero discharges is emphasized. Norway has both long term target to reduce emissions to air and to be carbon neutral in the future and to protect flora and fauna in the Arctic areas. What in general can be said from the findings are that there will probably be changes and effects on the existing BAT alternatives with Arctic conditions, mainly due to lower temperatures, remoteness and increased <b>requirements</b> <b>regarding</b> <b>emissions</b> and discharges to sea. There is also the question whether or not BAT is good enough for the Arctic? What is considered BAT is changing with time and perhaps {{there is a need for}} developing and implement techniques which currently are not presently regarded as BAT. There are large uncertainties when it comes to impacts and effects from offshore activities on the Arctic environment. What is considered BAT today might not be the same tomorrow and collaboration between different stakeholder such as governments, companies and nations are important for the future to be able to decrease the environmental impacts from oil and gas industry...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} fulfil <b>requirements</b> <b>regarding</b> <b>emission</b> of harmful gases to atmosphere, the gas turbine {{technologies}} {{had to develop}} into clean techniques for energy generation. Lean premixed combustion of natural gas is one of them. Since during this process exceed of air is used, the total combustion temperature is relatively low. In consequence fewer pollutants are produced. The major drawback {{of this process is}} high sensitivity on the thermo-acoustic instabilities. Inside the combustion chamber interaction between several phenomena takes place. Three of them, i. e. combustion, acoustics and the combustion chamber walls vibration coupled together into closed feedback loop might finally lead to the gas turbine failure. The destruction process has an origin in flame intrinsic instabilities. When those are promoted by coupling the heat release fluctuations with acoustic field perturbations, the unsteady self-excited oscillations of the pressure field inside the combustion chamber grows up in the amplitude and exert significant forces on the chamber walls called liner. The liner is a critical component since has to operate reliably at extremely high temperatures. This has a significant negative influence on the liner performance and its material properties. Additional pressure forces acting on the walls surface due to unstable combustion reduce significantly the life time of the liner and gas turbine itself. In this paper the thermo-acoustic instabilities are investigated in combination with liner vibrations. The investigations are done at the combustion test rig which may operate with maximum power of 500 kW and absolute pressure equal to 5 bar. In order to observe influence of the wall configuration on the overall instabilities two liners constructions i. e. stiff and flexible one are taken into account. Both liners are investigated at various pressure levels. Finally, relation between perturbations upstream of the burner and system response in form of flame transfer function is obtained. ...|$|R

In the four transmitter case, the RMSDS at position 1 is comparable to that at position 9 for the circular emission since {{the effect of the}} reflections is almost the same near the corner (position 1) and near the wall (position 9), regardless of the shape of the emission cross-section. This is because the light components are well distributed, even in the circular emission cross-section case. It {{should be noted that the}} distribution <b>requirements</b> <b>regarding</b> the circular <b>emission</b> cross-section transmitters is relaxed by using a large number of transmitters.|$|R
40|$|In an {{automotive}} powertrain system, {{the cylinder}} liner {{is one of}} the most critical components which possesses the intricate structural configurations coupled with complex pattern of various operational loads. This paper attempts to develop a concrete and practical procedure for the optimization of cylinder liner distortion for achieving future <b>requirements</b> <b>regarding</b> exhaust <b>emissions,</b> fuel economy, and oil consumptions. First, numerical calculation based on finite element method (FEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is performed to capture the mechanism of cylinder liner distortion under actual engine operation conditions. Then, a spectrum analysis approach is developed to describe the distribution characteristic of operational loads (thermal and mechanical) around the circumference of a distorted cylinder bore profile; the FFT procedure provides an efficient way to implement this calculation. With this approach, a relationship between the dominant order of distortion and special operational load is obtained; the design features which are critically relative to cylinder liner distortion are also identified through spectrum analysis. After characterizing the variation tendency of each dominant order of distortion through parametric analysis, a new design scheme is established to implement the distortion optimization. Simulation results indicate that a much better solution is obtained by using the proposed scheme...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} theoretical model that explains differences in emission reductions of transboundary air pollutants among nations based on national income, political freedom, {{the cost of}} emission reductions, emissions from other countries, the type of pollutant, and the pollutant 2 Ì 7 s dispersion characteristics. The model {{is based on the}} theory of the private provision of impure public goods. This theoretical model is then used to derive a reduced form demand equation for emission reductions that can be econometrically estimated using spatial autoregressive techniques for time-series cross-section data;The econometric model is applied to 25 European nations and covers the period from 1980 to 1990. These nations were signatories to the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which mandated reductions in sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and the 1988 Sofia Protocol, which limited emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x). The signing of these treaties indicated a recognition of the problems caused by acid rain and ozone pollution, yet the two treaties had very different <b>requirements</b> <b>regarding</b> <b>emission</b> reductions. By taking into account the differences between nations and the different characteristics of the pollutants, my model allows a closer examination {{of the reasons for the}} differences in treaty requirements and treaty adherence;The results indicate that nations follow a Nash-subscription model in choosing their emission reductions. In other words, nations tend to free ride on the emission reductions of other nations. The spatial autoregressive model performs convincingly for SO 2, but the model for NO x is less satisfying. While nations continue to exhibit Nash behavior, other variables fail to be significant or have the wrong sign. However, these results may be explained as resulting from the characteristic nature of NO x as compared with SO 2. Since it originates from a larger number of sources, it is harder to control than SO 2 emissions;A better understanding of the factors that influence a nation 2 Ì 7 s decision to reduce its emissions may provide a foundation for the negotiation of future transboundary pollution control treaties. New treaties could require some nations to make greater (or smaller) cuts in emissions, but by taking into account differences among the nations, larger total reductions and greater compliance might result...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{conversion}} of municipal and industrial waste is an environmentally friendly way to recover energy from waste. There are many governmental <b>requirements</b> <b>regarding</b> air <b>emissions</b> from such processes. A tight control {{is required for}} the operation of the combustion chamber as there are many unknown disturbances, the biggest being the composition of the waste. Classic PID controllers will only just provide the required control, hence model predictive control, MPC, was proposed to optimise the control. This thesis covers the preparatory work for the implementation of MPC. This report describes how a transient model of the secondary combustion chamber was derived. The model consists of material and energy balances for six control volumes with a simplified approach the combustion reaction. The report also gives a short description of the entire process in a typical Energos energy from waste plant and some basics on MPC and Kalman filtering. Model simulations were performed in Cybernetica's software ModelFit. Operational data from an Energos plant was used as input to the model and measured outputs were compared to predicted outputs. Parameter estimation was also performed using the process data. The implementation of model predictive control for this system was considered. A first order divided difference Kalman filter was implemented in ModelFit for model updating that improved the accuracy of the predictions. This is an important step on the way towards MPC...|$|R
40|$|The {{escalating}} {{amount of}} {{vehicles on the}} road has raised awareness to vehicular environmental impacts and sustainability; this has provided a stimulus for future mobility considerations. The conventional car may not meet future <b>requirements</b> <b>regarding</b> noise, <b>emissions</b> and energy consumption. There is a distinct lack of short-term alternative solutions that meet consumer requirements and has a potential for mass production. Furthermore, {{the internal combustion engine}} has been developed over 100 years and there may be some risk that the automotive companies choose to invest into the âwrong â alternative. This paper presents a development process in an attempt to find answer this dilemma. The first consideration is the vehicle performance criteria that take into account consumer expectations and operational/regulatory/environmental factors. Secondly, the drive train components are identified, most are commercially available, and are particular to these factors. Finally, a computer simulation is used to assess the performance of the vehicle, in comparison with the factors. The result of these investigations is a series hybrid electric vehicle that is recharged from the mains. The fuel consumption is four times better than that of a comparable car, but vehicle mass and cost have not increased significantly. The driving range of this vehicle {{is not limited to the}} battery-capacity. This vehicle meets the consumer expectations as well as environmental issues and benefits with added driver comfort. Still being low-cost, it provides the potential for mass-production and thus reducing overall impacts on the environment. Copyright 2002 EVS 1...|$|R
40|$|Background to the {{investigations}} was the {{revision of the}} current selection criteria of the German ecolabel ("Blue Angel") for copiers (RAL-UZ 62) and printers (RAL-UZ 85). In the old labels limits were set for ozone, dust and styrene emissions. The corresponding test methods did no longer fulfil today's <b>requirements</b> with <b>regard</b> to <b>emission</b> measurements. In addition, the contrary emission behaviour of hardcopy devices due {{to the use of}} different and non-comparable test methods has been recently discussed. For this reason a new test method had to be developed which enables a reliable, reproducible determination of emission rates for dust, ozone, styrene, benzene and TVOC. The basis for this was the ECMA Standard 328 compiled by ECMA (European Computer Manufacturer Association) using dynamic chamber measurements. Nine different machines, desktop laser printers as well as office devices like bigger copiers and multifunctional devices were investigated. As a result of the st udy new criteria for the "Blue Angel" for copiers, printers and a new created for multifunctional devices (RAL-UZ 114), concerning TVOC, styrene, benzene, ozone and dust emissions were determined...|$|R
40|$|Heavy duty {{trucks are}} faced with strict <b>requirements</b> <b>regarding</b> exhaust <b>emissions</b> and fuel efficiency. The demands are {{achieved}} through downsizing and downspeeding. This introduces torsional vibrations in the powertrain which, if not dealt with, will decrease life and comfort. One solution that deals with these vibrations is the Dual Mass Flywheel that absorbs the vibrations. The goal of this thesis is to develop and verify different computational models of a Dual Mass Flywheel and in particular study how the friction between the arc-spring and the primary ywheel affects the system. Modelling is done in Python using the Newmark- method combined with Newton's method for numerical simulations. The same model is also created in AVL Excite for verification. The friction between the arc-spring and the primary flywheel channel is modelled using the Coulomb friction model or an inverse tangent function. It has been verified that the two computational models give similar results. A method to approximate Coulomb friction has been developed {{in order to make}} the computational model more stable. The friction depends on both spring compression and centripetal force due to the rotation of the Dual Mass Flywheel. For a truck's operating speed the spring compression is the largest factor to frictional losses with current selection of geometrical and structural parameters. The results show that with low friction and low viscous damping resonance is not a significant problem even if it occurs at low engine speed. A study about the number of masses needed to solve the friction model have been performed. It is concluded that the friction moment has not converged using five spring masses. A method of achieving accurate results with few masses is presented. For a final conclusion about the dynamics of the Dual Mass Flywheel, the developed computational models need to be validated using experimental data. Modifications of geometrical and structural parameters should be done to fit the experiments...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the {{numerical}} simulation of the flowfield in gas turbine burners. Due to the higher and higher <b>requirements</b> <b>regarding</b> pollutant <b>emissions</b> {{there is a need}} for new combustion technologies. In gas turbines one method to obtain low pollutant levels is the use of lean premixed or partially premixed combustion. However, in lean combustion problems regarding the flame stability can arise. Swirling jets can be used to assure flame stabilization by forming an internal recirculation zone which helps to re-ignite the eventually extincted flame. Additionally, the swirl is enhancing the mixture quality. This is important not only for flame stability and efficiency of combustion, but also the $NO_x$ levels have been proved to be highly dependent on the local mixture composition. Swirling flows, however, are difficult to examine experimentally because of the high sensitivity of the flowfield to external conditions. In addition, experimental approaches demand larger resources and are limited in studying effects of individual parameters. Consequently, the use of numerical methods is preferred for analysis and design. Of course, the design should be validated by experiments. Here, the flowfield downstream of a burner providing three swirling coaxial jets is studied numerically. The turbulence is accounted for by the Large Eddy Simulation approach because simpler methods has been proved to fail to account accurately for some characteristics of the swirling flows, like large streamline curvature and flow reversal. The spatial derivatives are discretized with high-order schemes ($ 3 rd$ and $ 4 th$ order). Because no experimental data exist for the given combustion chamber, the computational approach is tested first on a testcase involving a single swirling jet. Later, the flowfields obtained by altering different parameters (Reynolds number, swirl number, inlet velocity profile, confinement) are compared with a base case in order to evaluate the importance of each parameter in the present set-up. A study of the turbulent mixing in the combustion chamber is also presented. The effect of Schmidt number will be studied and the presence of counter gradient diffusion is established...|$|R

However, industry has to accept some responsibility for providing future solutions for the products they introduced and created the demand for in first place. Starting with a vision several years ago, Japanese car companies have now taken the lead with certain types of hybrid electric vehicles. These vehicles exhibit significantly reduced energy consumption, noise emission, exhaust emissions, and yet also have improved comfort and performance. They now thrive in the USA with seemingly unexpected popularity due to rocketing oil prices and increasing awareness of the risk of oil dependency. Many car companies now follow this lead. However, there are a vast variety of possible hybrid drivetrain configurations. Modeling and simulation can help in the development and assessment of future drivetrain solutions. This paper focuses on this task using a commercially available modeling and simulation package. A drivetrain design is developed going through some initial considerations based on vehicle performance criteria that take into account consumer expectations and operational/regulatory/environmental factors. Based on simulation studies the drive train components are identified, mostly from the available range. Finally, a computer simulation is used to assess the performance of the vehicle.
