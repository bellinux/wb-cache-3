50|$|The Model 28 <b>Receiving</b> <b>Selector,</b> {{also known}} as the LRS, {{converts}} incoming serial teletypewriter signals into parallel-wire intelligence. This equipment is capable of operating at 60, 75 or 100 words per minute and operates on a five-level start-stop code, with an option for six-level start-stop code. This unit is equipped with two types of contacts - code reading and timing contacts. The Model 28 <b>Receiving</b> <b>Selector,</b> equipped with a standard 115 VAC 60 Hz synchronous motor, is 8 inches high, 8.5 inches wide and 9.75 inches deep and weighs 16.5 pounds.|$|E
5000|$|The Teletype Model 28 is {{a product}} line of page printers, typing and non-typing tape {{perforator}} and tape reperforators, fixed-head single contact and pivoted head multi-contact transmitter-distributors, and <b>receiving</b> <b>selector</b> equipment. Regarded as the most rugged machines that the Teletype Corporation built, this line of teleprinters used an exchangeable type box for printing, and a sequential selector [...] "Stunt Box" [...] to mechanically initiate non-printing functions within the typing unit of the page printer, electrically control functions within the page printer and electrically control external equipment. The Teletype Corporation introduced the Model 28 as a commercial product in 1953, after this product had originally been designed for the US Military.|$|E
40|$|The {{modulator}} {{includes an}} oscillator generating signals, each having a different phase, and a <b>selector</b> <b>receiving</b> digital data. When the digital data <b>received</b> by the <b>selector</b> changes logic state, the selector supplies a {{first and second}} plurality of signals generated by the oscillator to first and second non-linear amplifiers, respectively. An adder then adds the output of each amplifier to generate a radio frequency output...|$|R

As known OLSR use {{the concept of an}} MPR mechanism where only nodes selected as MPRs can relay broadcast packet <b>received</b> from their <b>selectors,</b> those nodes have to satisfy certain requirements to assure this mission, speaking of stability and physical capacity (energy). we are describing a modification in the MPR selection based on the willingness concept, introducing two critical factors:Energy and mobility, we explain how choosing stable nodes with an important residual energy as MPRs can enhance the performance of a mobile adhoc networks.

The Teletype Model 28 is more rugged and more expensive than later Teletype Model 32 machines.

2500|$|The BCCI {{announced}} a 16-man India squad {{for the tour}} on 1 November. Sunil Joshi was the only regular {{member of the team}} left out. The Indian <b>selectors</b> <b>received</b> criticism for the exclusion of Mohammad Azharuddin and the inclusion of Ajay Jadeja and Ajit Agarkar from the squad that was justified by Chandu Borde, the chairman of selectors, as having chosen a squad of [...] "young blood" [...] and with [...] "focus ... on youth." [...] Later, Jadeja, who had torn a rotator cuff of his right shoulder on 10 November, a day prior to an ODI against New Zealand, was ruled out and Hrishikesh Kanitkar was named as his replacement, who was picked over Azharuddin, Nayan Mongia and Jacob Martin. The Australia squad for the first Test was announced on 6 December. For the second Test, Colin Miller was replaced by Brett Lee.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} discuss {{the results of a}} 2010 survey of LIS {{selectors}} at ARL institutions/libraries that do not support an ALA-accredited program to learn how and why LIS materials are collected at these institutions. Design/methodology/approach – Collection development librarians completed a survey that asked them to describe their institution's selection policies, practices, and budgets for LIS materials, along with their roles as LIS selectors/subject specialists. Findings – LIS collections primarily support librarians and staff in their daily work and ongoing professional development. However, most libraries' LIS collections budgets are comparatively small, <b>selectors</b> <b>receive</b> few requests for new materials, and collecting parameters vary by institution, but are limited in terms of subject, publisher, and audience. The majority of LIS selectors are also responsible for collection development in multiple subject areas and most engage in work outside collection development. Originality/value – This is the first paper to explore collection development of library and information science materials outside dedicated library school libraries...|$|R
40|$|Have {{you ever}} {{discovered}} an e-resource in your catalogue which was purchased months ago but {{still does not}} have a link for access? Have you received questions from requesting librarians about when they can expect access? Does it sometimes feel like requests for new products have fallen into a black hole? This session will describe how Western Libraries modified the CORAL software (developed by Notre Dame University Library) to smooth out our workflow and ensure that resources are requested, received and linked in a timely manner. The session will include a description of how the workflow operates by alerting the correct staff member that an action is required. The session will describe how feedback was <b>received</b> from subject <b>selectors</b> and how the form went through several modifications to better meet the needs of our institution. Although the software was originally adapted specifically for electronic resource acquisition, it has been expanded to include all resource requests in any format so that all requests come through one form. The session will be of interest to Librarians and Managers who have a role in the acquisition of material...|$|R
2500|$|In 1989 {{he succeeded}} Peter May as Chairman of the England Cricket <b>Selectors,</b> <b>receiving</b> £60,000 pay to {{compensate}} for his lost business interests, the first chairman to be so paid. [...] "Dexter was soon in action, initially by way of press conferences and then, as the season developed, by lightning visits to the county grounds. These he made, despite an operation to a heel that put {{him for a while}} on crutches, by motorbike and car, a demonstration of enthusiasm and interest that was impressive." [...] After the chaos of 1988 – the Summer of Four Captains he wanted the tough Mike Gatting as captain, but was vetoed by Ossie Wheatley and his status was immediately undermined. Instead the more relaxed David Gower was appointed for the six Test series. Dexter tackled the role with energy and enthusiasm, but the shine soon wore off as Allan Border's 1989 Australians beat England 4–0 to regain the Ashes, their first series victory in England since 1975. His cause was not helped by the announcement of the Mike Gatting's Rebel tour of South Africa {{in the middle of the}} series, which removed the England players Bill Athey, Kim Barnett, Ian Butcher, Chris Broad, Chris Cowdrey, Graham Dilley, Richard Ellison, John Emburey, Neil Foster, Bruce French, Paul Jarvis, Matthew Maynard, Tim Robinson, Greg Thomas and Alan Wells from contention. Admittedly England were already 2–0 down in the series and none of these players had shown any talent so far in the summer, but it was an indication of the division and demoralisation of English cricket. In the First Test at Headingley Dexter selected four fast bowlers and no spinners for the team, advised Gower to put Australia in to bat, only to see them made 601/7 and win by 210 runs. For the Second Test he wrote an inspirational hymn for the England cricketers to sing called [...] "Onward Gower's Soldiers" [...] and appointed a team chaplain, but remained aloof from the players and seldom visited the dressing room. At the end of the summer he told the press that he couldn't think of any mistakes he had made and later joked that the [...] "lines of Venus were in the wrong juxtaposition", which was incorrectly translated by the press as a genuine belief in New Age mysticism. The lackadaisical Gower was fired at the end of the summer and the more painstaking Graham Gooch was made captain until 1993, despite Dexter having called his previous appointment as captain as [...] "being hit in the face by a dead fish".|$|R
