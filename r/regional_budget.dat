40|$|AbstractTo {{predict the}} likely effects of {{management}} action on any point source discharge into the coastal ocean, {{it is essential}} to understand both the composition of the effluent and the environmental conditions in the receiving waters. We illustrate a broadly-applicable approach to evaluating the comprehensive environmental footprint of a discharge, using <b>regional</b> geochemical <b>budgets</b> and nearfield monitoring. We take as a case study municipal effluent discharged into the Strait of Georgia (west coast of Canada), where there has been public controversy over the discharge of screened or primary-treated effluent directly into the ocean. Wastewater contributes ≤ 1 % of the nitrogen, organic carbon and oxygen demand in the Strait and is unlikely to cause eutrophication, harmful algal blooms or hypoxia in this region. Metals (Hg, Pb, Cd) are controlled by natural cycles augmented by past mining and urbanization, with 0. 3 – 5 % of the flux contributed by wastewater. Wastewater contributes ~ 5 % of PCBs but ≤ 60 % of PBDEs and is likely also important for pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Effects of high organic flux on benthos are measurable in the immediate receiving environment. The availability of particle-active contaminants to enter the food chain depends on how long those contaminants remain in the sediment surface mixed layer before burial. Secondary treatment, slated for completion in Vancouver in 2030, will reduce fluxes of some contaminants, but will have negligible effect on <b>regional</b> <b>budgets</b> for organic carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, metals and PCBs. Removal of PBDEs from wastewater will affect <b>regional</b> <b>budgets,</b> depending on how the sludge is sequestered...|$|R

It emphasizes that no analysis of the fiscal effect of tax preferences and control of the shortfall in tax revenues of the budget is performed on the government level. It is partially related to the unsolved state of the problem of tax relieves identification.
