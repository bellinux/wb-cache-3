5|$|After 1485, the Duchy {{took the}} castle back into direct control, and by 1546 {{it was in}} poor repair. <b>Renovation</b> <b>work</b> was carried out under Elizabeth I, but a report of 1618 {{suggested}} that the castle was unable {{to function as a}} prison because of its poor condition, and fresh repair work was carried out in the 1620s and 1630s under Charles I.|$|E
5|$|The Courthouse on {{the main}} square was {{designed}} by Hans Christian Amberg and completed in 1892 when the town had only 4,000 inhabitants. The red-brick building with stepped gables, round-arched windows and a tower reaching 30m (98ft) in height resembles a medieval castle. After comprehensive <b>renovation</b> <b>work</b> in 2010, it is now used as a venue for weddings and houses the tourist office.|$|E

The <b>renovation</b> <b>work</b> for the 12thStreet and 14thStreet viaducts was completed in 2010. Renovation of the upper roadway, including the Hoboken Avenue Viaduct, and Conrail Viaduct on the lower roadway {{is expected to be}} completed by 2016.|$|E
5|$|Further <b>renovation</b> <b>work</b> in {{the early}} 1970s led to {{improvements}} in the building's structure and included restoration of the walls and windows. Large portions of cement additions by Zettervall to the exterior structure of the cathedral were removed decades later as they adversely affected the building's fabric. In 1989, Pope John Paul II took part in an ecumenical service in Uppsala Cathedral with Archbishop Bertil Werkström. Fire protection equipment was installed in 2010 and the electrical and heating systems have been replaced.|$|E
5|$|<b>Renovation</b> <b>work</b> {{started in}} the Sukiennice Museum in June 2008. The {{painting}} previously had been restored in 1915 and 1938. During World War II it was damaged while it was at Zamość, and in 1945 it was renovated. In 1974, experts again tried to restore it to its original condition before it went on public exhibition in Moscow. The most recent restoration process took place between 2006 and 2008, when the painting was finally returned to its former glory.|$|E

The {{vertical}} marquee which had marked the theatre's presence from 1926 to 1980, was removed, the orchestra pit and auditorium seating were rebuilt, the dressing rooms moved, and the technical systems updated. However, the furniture, fixtures and interior signage were retained. Even the paint was carefully restored to its original luster. The renovation made it suitable again for live performances and filled Seattle's need for a touring Broadway musical venue. <b>Renovation</b> <b>work</b> was completed without federal, state, or local funds.|$|E
5|$|The Blathwayt {{family owned}} the house until 1956, when the {{government}} acquired it, but during the Second World War it was used for child evacuees while rented by Lady Anne Islington, the wife of John Dickson-Poynder, 1st Baron Islington, who redecorated many of the rooms. The National Trust acquired it in 1961. In 2015 major <b>renovation</b> <b>work,</b> costing £3.8 million, included replacing the roof.

5|$|The {{monument}} {{was designed}} to commemorate the Duke of Wellington's victory at the Battle of Waterloo. Construction of the original design commenced in 1817; a revised and cheaper design was eventually used, though, and building was completed in 1854. It is now owned by the National Trust, who closed the monument {{to the public in}} 2007, owing to safety concerns.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the club's owners {{announced}} a modernisation of Stamford Bridge {{with plans for}} a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium. Work began on the East Stand in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and was never completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy, culminating in the freehold being sold to property developers. Following a long legal battle, {{it was not until}} the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at the stadium was secured and <b>renovation</b> <b>work</b> resumed. The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001.|$|E
5|$|Odense's City Hall (Odense Rådhus), {{with its}} medieval Italian look, was {{designed}} by Johan Daniel Herholdt and Carl Lendorf in the Historicist style. Completed in 1883, it combines red masonry with sandstone decorations, stepped gables and a saw-tooth course. It stands {{on the site of}} a smaller building from 1480. In 1937 Bent Helveg-Møller won the competition for the building's enlargement. The tower over the main entrance was torn down in 1942 but was not rebuilt. As work was delayed during the war, the extension was not completed until 1955.

5|$|Over the {{following}} century the neglect continued until some basic external <b>renovation</b> <b>work</b> was undertaken between 1965 and 1971, making the structure {{wind and water}} tight, although it remained unoccupied. The castle was again abandoned and left unmaintained. The condition of the building further declined, becoming derelict. It was in a ruinous state when marketed for sale in April 2013 {{after the death of}} Count Robin Mirrlees, who had owned it for about fifty years. At the end of that year it was purchased by the former model Olga Roh, who said she intended to restore it. Modern day reports suggest that the spirit of the 3rd Lord Banff and that of a white dog haunt the castle, which is classified as a category A listed building.|$|E
5|$|Richard II {{inherited}} Berkamsted Castle in 1377; {{initially the}} use of {{it was given to}} his favourite, Robert de Vere and, after de Vere's fall from power and exile in 1388, to John Holland. Henry IV lived in the castle after he deposed Richard in 1400, and he used the property to detain rival applicants to the throne. During this period Geoffrey Chaucer, later famous for his Canterbury Tales, oversaw <b>renovation</b> <b>work</b> on the castle in his role as a clerk. Both Henry V and Henry VI owned the castle, the latter making use of it until his overthrow in 1461.|$|E
5|$|Sir John Cope {{purchased}} {{the property in}} 1699, and his descendants occupied the premises until 1935. The Cope family shortened the wings {{on the south side}} in 1703, converted most of the chapel to a drawing room and introduced a mezzanine on the west side during the 18th century. They were responsible for much of the interior, with significant <b>renovation</b> <b>work</b> done in the 19th century and in 1920. After his victory over Napoleon, the Duke of Wellington was offered his choice of house by Parliament; he visited Bramshill but in 1817 chose Stratfield Saye instead.|$|E

5|$|Goodrich Castle {{became the}} scene {{of one of the}} most desperate sieges during the English Civil War in the 1640s, which saw the rival factions of Parliament and the king vie for power across England. In the years before the war, there had been a {{resurgence}} of building at the castle. Richard Tyler, a local lawyer, became the tenant and constable of the castle, and during the early 1630s there had been considerable <b>renovation</b> <b>work.</b> Shortly after the outbreak of war, the Earl of Stamford, with support from Tyler, garrisoned the castle for Parliament until December 1643, when increasing Royalist pressure in the region forced his withdrawal to Gloucester. The castle was then occupied by a garrison led by the Royalist Sir Henry Lingen. The occupation was not peaceful, with Royalist troops burning surrounding farm buildingsTyler himself was imprisoned by Lingen, although not before he had begun to sell off his livestock and other moveable property. Some references to Goodrich Castle during this period refer to it as Guthridge Castle, a variant on the name Goodrich.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the {{military}} rulers in Burma undertook <b>renovation</b> <b>work</b> on the Mahamuni Pagoda. During this period, the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole {{appeared in the}} belly of the Great Image. It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole in an attempt to steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image. It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night, resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter. Whilst the meeting was in progress, attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl. A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not been raped at all. It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha so it could be repaired. However, the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all.|$|E
5|$|Khaplu Palace is {{the second}} fort in Baltistan to be renovated by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. Renovation started in 2005 and was {{completed}} in 2011. The project {{was funded by the}} Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs via its embassy in Islamabad. USAID helped fund an exhibition centre for Balti culture inside the fort. The exhibition centre takes up two-thirds of the site. The <b>renovation</b> <b>work</b> was carried out with the help of people from 400 local families employed as an initiative towards community building. The survey encompassing the topographical features of the renovation site. begun in 2005, used Electronic Distance Measurement (EDM) devices. The survey helped in finding the original state of a number of decrepit portions of the palace. The renovation project was carried out following the Venice Charter's standards for restoration. The material procured for the restoration amounted to thirty million rupees (Rs 30 m), while the wages of the labourers aggregated to about twenty five million rupees (Rs 25 m).|$|E

40|$|It is a {{prevailing}} {{trend that}} <b>renovation</b> <b>works</b> have {{be carried out}} in many shopping centers in Hong Kong, especially those regional shopping centers being constructed and completed in the 1990 s. Buildings will be depreciated as they are assets. Refurbishment or renovation of a building can therefore rejuvenate the building and even enhance its market value. The physical structures and facilities can be improved. Therefore, many shopping centers' Landlord or Property Manager would consider renovation of their portfolio {{as a solution to}} solve the problem of depreciation and in turn to enhance the property value and its rental return. It is common to have examples of renovation of shopping centers recently in Hong Kong, for example, APM and the Moko which are developed by the Sun Hung Kai Properties, Pacific Place which is developed by the Swire Properties, and Times Square which is developed by the Wharf (Holdings) Limited. As retail properties are an opened market, it is easy to imagine that those shopping centers with <b>renovation</b> <b>works</b> being commenced recently must be in advantage when they are competing with those without any <b>renovation</b> <b>works</b> being carried out. To make the situation of shopping centers without renovation worse, Hong Kong is situated with shopping centers and it is a small city with a very convenient public transport system, the opportunity cost for shoppers to visit shopping centers in different locations is small. However, according to the data on the rental return of Festival Walk, a well-known regional shopping center in Hong Kong without any <b>renovation</b> <b>works</b> commenced, its rental revenue increased yearly. Therefore, this thesis researches on the effectiveness of <b>renovation</b> <b>works</b> on the success of shopping centers and the alternatives methods which shopping centers without <b>renovation</b> <b>works</b> used in order to maintain their competiveness. Through compare and contrast between shopping centers with <b>renovation</b> <b>works</b> and those without <b>renovation</b> <b>works,</b> it is concluded that the effectiveness of <b>renovation</b> <b>works</b> on shopping centers is low, as these two categories shows similar pattern in both their yearly occupancy rate and gross rental revenue. In the second part of this thesis, analysis on the survey with target groups as shoppers and tenants of Festival Walk is carried out. Through the analysis of data, it is found that the facilities of shopping centers being provided is not their top priority when choosing between shopping centers to visit and factors which affect the sales turnover rate respectively. In contrast, the degree of tenant mix, provision of anchor tenants and organization of marketing and promotional events are the most influential factor on shoppers and tenants. This thesis shows that the high effectiveness of <b>renovation</b> <b>works</b> in maximizing the shopping centers' rental return is only an illusion. As <b>renovation</b> <b>works</b> is a costly decision, this paper gives insight to the developers that they can consider other less costly methods, such as attracting more different potential tenants, when they wish to enhance their rental revenue. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
