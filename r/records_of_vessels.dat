40|$|PURPOSE: We {{investigated}} whether temporal oscillations <b>of</b> the retinal <b>vessel</b> diameter, {{as measured}} with the dynamic vessel analyzer (DVA), undergo age-related changes. METHODS: <b>Vessel</b> diameters <b>of</b> retinal arterial and venous segments were examined with the DVA in 28 medically healthy volunteers {{divided into two}} age groups of 14 persons each: young subjects (21 - 32 years) and seniors (52 - 70 years). Continuous temporal <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> diameter were mathematically evaluated and divided into high-frequency (period > 1. 5 s) and low-frequency (period < or = 1. 5 s) oscillations. RESULTS: The phase difference between temporal arterial and venous vessel diameter records was higher in the young group [0. 6 (0. 1, 3. 3) ] s [median (1 st quartile, 3 rd quartile) ] compared with the seniors [0. 1 (- 0. 4, 0. 3) s]. There was {{a difference in the}} periodicity in veins between the groups and, in seniors, between the arteries and the veins. CONCLUSIONS: High-frequency oscillations <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> diameter correspond to the heartbeat. These were expressed more in seniors.

Using a × 63 water immersion objective (Achroplan × 20 / 0.5 W, Zeiss), blood flow was monitored in individual venules. Thrombus formation was induced in randomly chosen venules by constant superfusion with 25 μL ferric chloride every 60 s (12.5 mmol/L; Sigma-Chemical, Deisenhofen, Germany). Additionally, the light-dye model was used in which the exposure of FITC-dextran to blue light results in the release of free oxygen radicals and consecutive damage of the endothelial cell. <b>Recording</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> was stopped after blood flow in the vessel ceased for at least 45 s due to complete vessel occlusion (CVO).|$|R

40|$|Angiogenesis inhibitors are {{receiving}} increased attention as cancer therapeutics, but {{little is known}} of the cellular effects of these inhibitors on tumor vessels. We sought to determine whether two agents, AG 013736 and VEGF-Trap, that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, merely stop angiogenesis or cause regression <b>of</b> existing tumor <b>vessels.</b> Here, we report that treatment with these inhibitors caused robust and early changes in endothelial cells, pericytes, and basement membrane <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in spontaneous islet-cell tumors of RIP-Tag 2 transgenic mice and in subcutaneously implanted Lewis lung carcinomas. Strikingly, within 24 hours, endothelial fenestrations in RIP-Tag 2 tumors disappeared, vascular sprouting was suppressed, and patency and blood flow ceased in some vessels. By 7 days, vascular density decreased more than 70 %, and VEGFR- 2 and VEGFR- 3 expression was reduced in surviving endothelial cells. Vessels in Lewis lung tumors, which lacked endothelial fenestrations, showed less regression. In both tumors, pericytes did not degenerate {{to the same extent}} as endothelial cells, and those on surviving tumor vessels acquired a more normal phenotype. Vascular basement membrane persisted after endothelial cells degenerated, providing a ghost-like <b>record</b> <b>of</b> pretreatment <b>vessel</b> number and location and a potential scaffold for vessel regrowth. The potent anti-vascular action observed is evidence that VEGF signaling inhibitors do more than stop angiogenesis. Early loss of endothelial fenestrations in RIP-Tag 2 tumors is a clue that vessel phenotype may be predictive of exceptional sensitivity to these inhibitors...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In a {{proportion}} of patients with preeclampsia, unremodeled spiral arteries develop additional pathological changes, termed decidual vasculopathy (DV), or acute atherosis. DV has been correlated to adverse clinical outcome and increased placental pathology. However, {{it was unclear whether}} these effects pertained to individual features of DV. METHODS: We performed a reanalysis of placental samples from preeclamptic pregnancies (n = 76), <b>recording</b> the number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> with DV, their location in the decidua and their morphological features. Results were correlated with clinical and placental parameters, using Spearman's rho test. P-value < 0. 05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Total number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> with DV (totalDV) correlated with higher diastolic blood pressure, higher urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, shorter gestational age, lower birth weight, 5 min APGAR score and umbilical artery pH, and with increased accelerated villous maturity, infarction and hematoma formation, but not with HELLP syndrome markers. Additionally, there was a striking correlation of increased perinatal mortality with the number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> located in the decidua basalis (DVbas), and with vessels showing DV with thrombosis (DVthrom). Other morphological features, such as foam cell infiltration, did not increase correlation strength. DISCUSSION: In our study of preeclamptic placental samples, totalDV related to worse clinical outcome and increased placental pathology. Moreover, DVbas and DVthrom related to perinatal death. DV could be a manifestation of an underlying (vascular) pathology, increasing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In preeclampsia, totalDV, DVbas and DVthrom correlated with increased placental pathology and adverse maternal and fetal outcome, most relevantly with perinatal mortality...|$|R
