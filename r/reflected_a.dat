5|$|Christmas in the United States {{during the}} post-war years (19461964) <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> period of peace, productivity, and prosperity. Americans staged sumptuous Christmases and enjoyed {{a variety of}} holiday foods unknown to {{previous}} generations. Several films, foods, toys, and television programs of the era have become American Christmas traditions.|$|E

5|$|In October 2007, the {{division}} was renamed the 104th Division (Leader Training). This change <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> change in {{the division}}'s mission, specifically training officer and non-commissioned officer candidates in their assigned fields.|$|E

50|$|A chirped {{mirror is}} made to <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> wider range of frequencies. This is done by {{creating}} layers with different depths. There may be 10 layers with a depth designed to <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> certain wavelength of light, another 10 layers with slightly greater depth to <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> slightly longer wavelength of light, and so on for {{the entire range of}} wavelengths of light the mirror is designed to reflect. The result is a mirror that can <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> whole range of light wavelengths rather than single narrow band of wavelengths.|$|R

5|$|In the Decembers of 1916 and 1917, German overtures to the British for truces were {{recorded}} without any success. In some French sectors, singing and {{an exchange of}} thrown gifts was occasionally recorded, though these may simply have <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> seasonal extension of the live-and-let-live approach common in the trenches.|$|E
5|$|All in all, the {{membership}} <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> mid-1950s combination of anti-communist Western nations and such nations in Southeast Asia. The United Kingdom, France and the United States, {{the latter of}} which joined after the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty by an 82–1 vote, represented the strongest Western powers. Canada also considered joining, but decided against {{it in order to}} concentrate on its NATO responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|Averages, however, can be deceiving. For example, at the 2007 Fall Yearling sale at Keeneland, 3,799 young horses {{sold for}} a total of $385,018,600, for an average of $101,347 per horse. However, that average sales price <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> {{variation}} that included at least 19 horses that sold for only $1,000 each and 34 that sold for over $1,000,000 apiece.|$|E
50|$|In {{cognitive}} linguistic terms, force dynamic expressions <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> conceptual archetype {{because of}} their conceptual basality (Langacker 1999:24). In this view, expressions involving psychological forces <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> extension of the category of force dynamics from the physical domain to the psychological domain.|$|R
50|$|The {{remarkable}} {{feature of}} this butterfly's wing is that it contains rows of very small concave surfaces that reflect light in many ways. For instance, {{the centre of the}} concave surface <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> yellow-green light and the edges <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> blue light.|$|R

5|$|KRS-One {{considered}} Run-D.M.C. {{the epitome}} of rap music in 1984 and had begun to rap following their lead.

5|$|Lundström {{points out}} (p.134) {{that some of}} the {{international}} and national reports took on the features of urban legends. They <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> prevailing disrespect for the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, who were portrayed in the newspapers as uncomprehending savages who had killed the three men or showed a deadly indifference to their plight. These speculations were refuted in 1930, upon the discovery of the expedition's final resting place on Kvitøya by the crews of two ships, the Bratvaag and the Isbjørn.|$|E
5|$|On 14August1942, Herring {{was ordered}} to Esk, Queensland, to assume command of II Corps with the {{temporary}} rank of Lieutenant General. As such, {{he was responsible for}} the defence of Brisbane. At this time he was criticised in Federal Parliament by Arthur Calwell for allegedly issuing a verbal order whilst commander of the 6th Division that no officer was to be commissioned unless they had at least attained an Intermediate Certificate. There was no evidence that such an order was ever issued, but the allegation <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> suspicion that Herring was an elitist.|$|E

5|$|Sir John Betjeman (1906–1984) was a twentieth-century English poet, {{writer and}} broadcaster. Born to a middle-class family in Edwardian Hampstead, he {{attended}} Oxford University, although left without graduating. He {{turned down a}} position in the family furniture business, and instead took a series of jobs before becoming the assistant editor of The Architectural Review in 1931, which <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> deeply held affection for buildings and their history. That same year he published his first book, Mount Zion, a collection of poems.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy {{continued}} {{to expand its}} battlefleet, laying down two ships in most subsequent years until 1920. The US {{continued to}} use reciprocating engines {{as an alternative to}} turbines until the , laid down in 1912. In part, this <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> cautious approach to battleship-building, and in part a preference for long endurance over high maximum speed.|$|E
5|$|The {{declaration}} spurred {{an unintended}} and extraordinary {{increase in the}} number of adherents of American Zionism; in 1914 the 200 American Zionist societies comprised a total of 7,500 members, which grew to 30,000 members in 600 societies in 1918 and 149,000 members in 1919. Whilst the British had considered that the declaration <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> previously established dominance of the Zionist position in Jewish thought, it was the declaration itself that was subsequently responsible for Zionism's legitimacy and leadership.|$|E

Unlike the pre-Gillett era, the team is now privately owned by the Molson family and not by the Molson brewery, which is now a division of Molson Coors. The reputed sale price <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> return to profitability, due both to a new collective bargaining agreement after the 2004–05 lockout that fixed player costs to revenues and to {{a rise in the}} value of the Canadian dollar back to at or near parity with the U.S. dollar.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin's {{grandfather}} Erasmus Darwin {{outlined a}} hypothesis of transmutation of {{species in the}} 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the conquest}} of Antananarivo in 1793, Andrianampoinimerina shifted the {{political}} capital of Imerina from Ambohimanga to its original site at Antananarivo, while pronouncing Ambohimanga the kingdom's spiritual capital. Important traditional rituals continued {{to be held at}} Ambohimanga, and Andrianampoinimerina regularly stayed in its Mahandrihono palace. His son, Radama I, inhabited Ambohimanga's Nanjakana compound as a youth before relocating to Antananarivo, and visited Ambohimanga frequently after the move. Radama's widow and successor, Ranavalona I, renovated the Mahandrihono compound and moved several buildings from the sister rova at Antananarivo to Ambohimanga. She also forbade swine at Ambohimanga due to their association with Europeans, who had propagated pork as a food source in the decade prior. Subsequent queens made their own mark on the site, including the reconstruction of Nanjakana by Rasoherina, and Ranavalona II's addition of two large pavilions to the Mahandrihono compound that <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> syncretism of traditional and Western architectural styles.|$|E

5|$|Gil {{started to}} play music {{as a child and}} was still a {{teenager}} when he joined his first band. He {{began his career as a}} bossa nova musician, and then grew to write songs that <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> focus on political awareness and social activism. He was a key figure in the Música popular brasileira and tropicália movements of the 1960s, alongside artists such as longtime collaborator Caetano Veloso. The Brazilian military regime that took power in 1964 saw both Gil and Veloso as a threat, and the two were held for nine months in 1969 before they were told to leave the country. Gil moved to London, but returned to Bahia in 1972 and continued his musical career, as well as working as a politician and environmental advocate.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Haefliger's extramarital affair, {{which had}} lasted {{for over a}} decade, came to an end. Bellette and Haefliger left Australia {{intending}} to divorce quietly, but were reconciled. After a year in Paris they settled in Majorca, living first in Deià before buying {{a house in the}} hamlet of C'an Baxu. Bellette painted landscapes and still lifes that <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> Spanish influence, and showed periodically in Australia through the 1960s.

5|$|In March 1994, the Washington Agreement was signed, {{ending the}} Croat–Bosniak War, and {{providing}} Croatia with US military advisors from Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI). The US involvement <b>reflected</b> <b>a</b> new military strategy endorsed by Bill Clinton in February 1993. Because the UN arms embargo {{was still in}} place, MPRI was hired ostensibly to prepare the HV {{for participation in the}} NATO Partnership for Peace programme. MPRI trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995. It has also been speculated in several sources, including an article in The New York Times by Leslie Wayne and in various Serbian media reports, that MPRI may also have provided doctrinal advice, scenario planning and US government satellite intelligence to Croatia, although MPRI, American and Croatian officials have denied such claims. In November 1994, the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, in effect allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments flowed through Croatia.|$|E
