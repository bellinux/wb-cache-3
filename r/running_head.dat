60|$|The brig's {{head had}} been laid so as to pass a little to {{windward}} of the small islands of the Carimata group. They had been till then hidden in the night, but now both men on the lookout reported land ahead in one long cry. Lingard, standing to leeward abreast of the wheel, watched the islet first seen. When it was nearly abeam of the brig he gave his orders, and Wasub hurried off to the main deck. The helm was put down, the yards on the main came slowly square and the wet canvas of the main-topsail clung suddenly to the mast after a single heavy flap. The dazzling streak of the ship's wake vanished. The vessel lost her way and began to dip her bows into the quick succession of the <b>running</b> <b>head</b> seas. And at every slow plunge of the craft, {{the song of the}} wind would swell louder amongst the waving spars, with a wild and mournful note.|$|E

50|$|NCAA Football 13 {{will include}} two rule changes {{which will be}} taking effect in NCAA Division I (A) FBS games in the 2012-13 season.

Players will also need to stay within 5 yards of the ball on kickoff to prevent a <b>running</b> <b>head</b> start. The second rule change affects kickoffs and other free kicks where if a player gets a touchback the ball will start on the 25 yard line instead of the 20.|$|E
50|$|The fight {{resulted}} in a crushing defeat for the Federals; they had the Rangers bottled up in a barnyard with only one exit, on a farm surrounded on two sides by water and outnumbered them by more than 2 to 1. By all accounts, the Rangers should have been wiped out that morning, but Flint made several mistakes. The most glaring was his insistence on leading a saber charge against the Rangers, who made notorious use of drawn pistols in their fights. The Vermonters were armed with carbines, which the Rangers could not match. If Flint had dismounted and attacked with those weapons the Federals could have easily overpowered the trapped Rangers, and in all likelihood Flint would have survived the fight rather than <b>running</b> <b>head</b> on into the Rangers deadly volley.|$|E

50|$|The hit and run {{also has}} {{defensive}} qualities. In normal play the baserunner would start toward second base {{when the ball}} was hit. If the defensive players react fast enough, {{they may be able}} to throw the ball to second and first before either runner has reached their base, resulting in a double play. In the case of the hit and run, the baserunner has a head start, increasing the baserunner's probability of reaching second base before the ball. This may force the fielders to attempt the out only at first, thereby advancing the runner. It may also allow the runner to advance more bases on a hit than he might otherwise due to that <b>running</b> <b>head</b> start. Although a line drive can easily turn into a double play, line drives are rare so the risk of being doubled off from a line drive is minimal.|$|E
