40|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>charge</b> {{mechanism}} {{is considered to}} be a specific mechanism when applying the value added tax. The liability to declare and pay the output tax is transferred to the recipient of the fulfillment within the <b>reverse</b> <b>charge</b> mechanism. Since Apri 1 1, 2011 there has been extended the application of the <b>reverse</b> <b>charge</b> mechanism <b>to</b> the domestic (home) fulfillments and since this date the mechanism has been applied to the delivery of slag, waste and metal scrap, defined in the Annex 5 and to the trading with the greenhouse gas emissions allowances. Since January 1, 2012 the <b>reverse</b> <b>charge</b> mechanism has been applied also for construction and assembly works which leads to a significant extension of VAT payers which this provision may affect.

40|$|Hollow {{mesoporous}} silica nanoparticles were successfully fabricated and functionalized with appropriate silanes. After modifications, amine, carboxyl, cyano, and methyl groups were grafted onto the nanoparticles and all functionalized hollow {{mesoporous silica}} nanoparticles maintained a spherical and hollow structure {{with a mean}} diameter of ~ 120 [*]nm and a shell thickness of ~ 10 [*]nm. The loading capacity of the hollow mesoporous silica nanoaprticles to the anticancer drug, 5 -fluorouracil, can be controlled via precise functionalization. The presence of amine groups {{on the surface of}} nanoparticles resulted in the highest loading capacity of 28. 89 %, due to the amine functionalized nanoparticles having a similar hydrophilicity but <b>reverse</b> <b>charge</b> <b>to</b> the drug. In addition, the change in pH leads to the variation of the intensity of electrostatic force between nanoparticles and the drug, which finally affects the loading capacity of amine functionalized hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles to some extent. Higher drug loading was observed at pH of 7. 4 and 8. 5 as 5 -fluorouracil becomes more deprotonated in alkaline conditions. The improved drug loading capacity by amine functionalized hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles has demonstrated that they can become potential intracellular 5 -fluorouracil delivery vehicles for cancers...|$|R

Nominally 60 A, 4. 5 kV rated JBS freewheeling diodes were paired with similarly rated Si IGBTs and evaluated for temperature dependent static and dynamic characteristics {{as well as}} HTRB and surge capability. The SiC JBS/Si IGBT pair was also directly compared to Si PiN diode/Si IGBT with similar ratings. Compared to Si, the SiC freewheeling diode produced over twenty times lower <b>reverse</b> recovery <b>charge</b> leading <b>to</b> approximately a factor-of-four-reduction in turn-on loss. Alternatively, for equivalent total switching loss, the SiC JBS/Si IGBT hybrid configuration allows {{for at least a}} 50 % increase in specific switched power density.

" By contrasting write-off recognition and reversal across the pre- and post- new CAS announcement regimes, we show that firms listed on Chinese stock exchanges recognized less impairment charges during the "transition" period [...] after announcement of the new standard and before the effective date [...] than in pre-announcement periods. Meanwhile, firms with substantial previous write-downs <b>reversed</b> more impairment <b>charges</b> <b>to</b> achieve their earnings targets in the transition period.
