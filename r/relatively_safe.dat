40|$|Abstract: Based on TM {{remote sensing}} image and {{topographic}} map, the spatial information of landscape pattern was extracted in study areasin 1990, 2000 and 2010. With the principles and methods of landscape ecology, land use/cover change, ecosystem service values were selected to construct the ecological safety index which was used to quantitatively analyze the dynamic changes of landscape pattern and elucidated ecological safety status in study area. Result showed that During the 20 years from 1990 to 2010, as human factors interference increase, the farmland and construction land increased by 21. 11 % and 15. 38 % respectively, the grassland area is reduced by 27. 57 %. Cropland had anincreased trend {{during the period of}} 1990 to 2010 period,The wood land and swamp landhad an increased trend during the period of 1990 to 2000 area also, but reduced during from 2000 to 2010. From 1990 to 2010, the whole study area lied in the level of <b>relatively</b> <b>safer,</b> but the safe area was reduced the amount of 4967 ha during 2000 to 2010. The <b>relatively</b> <b>safer</b> land areas was increased first then reduced during the whole study period, the relatively non-safer level land and <b>relatively</b> <b>safer</b> level land areas were accounting for 10. 81 % and 2. 92 % of the total arearespectively...|$|R

5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy {{electrons and}} thus is <b>relatively</b> <b>safe</b> to handle. It decays with a half-life of 330days to californium-249, which is a strong emitter of ionizing alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also free-radical effects and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|Historically, in-water {{recompression}} was {{the usual}} method of treating decompression sickness in remote areas. Procedures were often informal and based on operator experience, and used air as the breathing gas as it {{was all that was}} available. The divers generally used standard diving gear, which was <b>relatively</b> <b>safe</b> for this procedure, as the diver was at low risk of drowning if he lost consciousness.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 25 March, the prisoners enacted their plan. Serious {{problems}} arose immediately. The tunnel hatch proved difficult to open and the tunnel exit was several metres short of the <b>relatively</b> <b>safe</b> forested area. These problems led to delays and only 76 POWs managed to make their break for freedom. As originally intended, Marcinkus {{was one of the}} first ten to escape.|$|E

When the new breaker opened, it was the [...] "crown jewel of a <b>relatively</b> <b>safer,</b> more modern anthracite industry". However, the breaker stopped operating in 1965.|$|R
50|$|The {{people of}} Zadar, Iadasinoi, were first {{mentioned}} in 384 BC as the {{allies of the}} natives of Hvar {{and the leaders of}} an eastern Adriatic coast coalition in the fight against the Greek colonizers. An expedition of 10,000 men in 300 ships sailed out from Zadar and laid siege to the Greek colony Pharos in the island of Hvar, but the Syracusan fleet of Dionysus was alerted and attacked the siege fleet. The naval victory went to the Greeks which allowed them <b>relatively</b> <b>safer</b> further colonization in the southern Adriatic.|$|R
30|$|Previous studies {{report a}} lower rate of gaming {{addiction}} (e.g. 15.6  % noted in a survey conducted by Wang et al. 2014). We argue that home gaming might be <b>relatively</b> <b>safer</b> than Internet café gaming because parental supervision and familial intervention (e.g. parental control of gaming duration and frequency, removing gaming devises, and suspension of Internet services, etc.) {{seem to be more}} available than help to be provided by the Internet café operators. This exploratory study provides support for conducting future research to verify if the prevalence rate of gaming addiction is higher at the Internet café than at home.|$|R
5|$|The {{defense of}} Constantinople {{was under the}} command of Patriarch Sergius and the patrician Bonus. Upon hearing the news, Heraclius split his army into three parts; {{although}} he judged that the capital was <b>relatively</b> <b>safe,</b> he still sent some reinforcements to Constantinople to boost the morale of the defenders. Another part of the army was {{under the command of}} his brother Theodore and was sent to deal with Shahin, while the third and smallest part would remain under his own control, intending to raid the Persian heartland.|$|E
5|$|When {{given for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} is a <b>relatively</b> <b>safe</b> antibiotic. It {{can be used}} in people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common side effects with short-term use include headache, diarrhea, rash, and nausea. Serious side effects may include serotonin syndrome, bone marrow suppression, and high blood lactate levels, particularly when used for more than two weeks. If used for longer periods still, it may cause sometimes irreversible nerve damage including optic nerve damage.|$|E
5|$|After being re-established in December 1940, I./JG 1's primary {{responsibility}} was the air defence of Germany and its Northern occupied territories. In this role, the unit almost exclusively {{worked in the}} Netherlands prior to its transfer to central West Germany. Its main opponents through 1940–41 were therefore lone RAF reconnaissance aircraft, the anti-shipping aircraft of RAF Coastal Command and the medium bombers of RAF Bomber Command's 2 Group, although the group would see little action compared to other theaters during 1941. During this time, this sector was considered <b>relatively</b> <b>safe</b> compared to other theaters.|$|E

Many of the prominent schools of Colombo were shifted to the <b>relatively</b> <b>safer</b> Bandarawela town. In 1942 forms 1 - 3 of Royal College, Colombo were moved from its temporary premises in a bungalow on Turret Road, Colombo to the Glendale Bungalow in Bandarawela. Later in 1944, the Royal Preparatory School was also shifted to Glendale. The school functioned as the Bandarawela branch of Royal College, Colombo until 1948, when the sections were moved back to Colombo.|$|R

5|$|In the 19th century, the {{fin whale}} was {{occasionally}} hunted by open-boat whalers, {{but it was}} <b>relatively</b> <b>safe,</b> because it could easily outrun ships {{of the time and}} often sank when killed, making the pursuit a waste of time for whalers. However, the later introduction of steam-powered boats and harpoons that exploded on impact made it possible to kill and secure them along with blue and sei whales on an industrial scale. As other whale species became overhunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant fin whale as a substitute. It was primarily hunted for its blubber, oil, and baleen. Around 704,000 fin whales were caught in Antarctic whaling operations alone between 1904 and 1975.|$|E
5|$|Law enforcement's corrupt {{attitude}} generally {{was not at}} {{the expense}} of the people. Apart from the economic benefits provided by the Maceos, these bosses provided a high degree of protection to the island's citizens. When serious crimes were committed the local police would sometimes contact the Maceos to have the matter dealt with. However, the island was not completely peaceful; threats at the point of a gun were a common means for the Maceo gang to ensure control. Though the average citizen was <b>relatively</b> <b>safe,</b> gangland slayings of potential rivals did take place on occasion.|$|E
5|$|The Nez Perce {{people lived}} in what today is eastern Washington, Oregon, and western Idaho, where they engaged in {{agriculture}} as well as horse breeding. The Nez Perce first obtained horses from the Shoshone around 1730. They {{took advantage of the}} fact that they lived in excellent horse-breeding country, <b>relatively</b> <b>safe</b> from the raids of other tribes, and developed strict breeding selection practices for their animals, establishing breeding herds by 1750. They were one of the few tribes that actively used the practice of gelding inferior male horses and trading away poorer stock to remove unsuitable animals from the gene pool, and thus were notable as horse breeders by the early 19th century.|$|E

40|$|Compared {{to other}} {{antipsychotics}} quetiapine {{has been reported}} to be <b>relatively</b> <b>safer</b> in overdose. We report a case with paranoid schizophrenia who attempted suicide with 1400 mg of quetiapine and manifested drowsiness, supraventricular tachycardia (167 /minute) and minimal ST depression in leads V 1 to V 6 on ECG; all other physiological parameters were normal. Gastric lavage, lorazepam 2 mg i/v to control agitation, and 14 -hour observation in emergency ended in she being sent home. Subsequently she was successfully managed with ECTs, and quetiapine 600 mg and risperidone 6 mg daily.

5|$|During the battle, most of {{the women}} and {{children}} had gathered in the sacristy of the church. As Mexican soldiers entered the room, a boy, thought to be the son of defender Anthony Wolf, stood up to rearrange a blanket around his shoulders. Mistaking him for a Texian soldier, the Mexican soldiers bayoneted him. In the confusion, {{at least one of the}} women was lightly wounded. Bowie's family, including Gertrudis Navarro, Juana Navarro Alsbury and her son, were hiding in one of the rooms along the west wall. Navarro opened the door to their room to signal that they meant no harm. A Mexican officer soon arrived and led the women to a spot along one of the walls where they would be <b>relatively</b> <b>safe.</b> All of the women and children were eventually placed under the protection of an officer and escorted out of the Alamo and imprisoned in the home of the Musquiz family.|$|E
5|$|When {{used for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} is a <b>relatively</b> <b>safe</b> drug. Common {{side effects of}} linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which {{may be a sign}} of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the quinolones, linezolid has no effect on the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban iguana is {{naturally}} distributed in rocky coastal areas on Cuba and throughout {{as many as}} 4,000 islets surrounding the Cuban mainland, including Isla de la Juventud off the southern coast, which {{has one of the}} most robust populations. <b>Relatively</b> <b>safe</b> populations are found on some islets along the north and south coasts and in isolated protected areas on the mainland. These include Guanahacabibes Biosphere Reserve in the west, Desembarco del Granma National Park, Hatibonico Wildlife Refuge, Punta Negra-Quemados Ecological Reserve, and Delta del Cauto Wildlife Refuge, all in eastern Cuba. Because of this wide distribution, accurate information about the number of distinct subpopulations of Cuban iguanas cannot be determined. The population on the US Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay has been estimated at 2,000 to 3,000 individuals, and the animals are treated well and protected by US forces stationed at the base. An unusual incident occurred when a detainee in the prison assaulted a guard with a bloody tail torn from a Cuban iguana in May 2005.|$|E
5000|$|In 1608, a 13 {{year old}} English ensign named Thomas Savage {{was traded to}} Chief Powhatan for a native boy, Nemotacke, as {{something}} like a cultural exchange student.

5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were <b>relatively</b> <b>safe</b> from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E
5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was <b>relatively</b> <b>safe,</b> Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E

5|$|Italy {{declared}} neutrality at {{the start}} of World War I, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic, which could also be easily seeded with minefields. The threat from these underwater weapons was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the <b>relatively</b> <b>safer</b> southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.|$|R
25|$|Trazodone {{appears to}} be <b>relatively</b> <b>safer</b> than TCAs, MAOIs, {{and a few of}} the other second-generation {{antidepressants}} in overdose situations, especially when it is the only agent taken. Fatalities are rare, and uneventful recoveries have been reported after ingestion of doses as high as 6,000–9,200mg. In one report, 9 of 294 cases of overdose were fatal, and all nine patients had also taken other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. When trazodone overdoses occur, clinicians should carefully monitor for hypotension, a potentially serious toxic effect. In a report of a fatal trazodone overdose, torsades de pointes and complete atrioventricular block developed, along with subsequent multiple organ failure, with a trazodone plasma concentration of 25.4mg/L on admission.|$|R
25|$|Until May 15, {{evacuation}} of noncombatants, including children, was generally {{opposed by the}} Yishuv leadership. It was argued that Israel's aim in the war was the continuation of normal life and that under the circumstances, {{it was impossible to}} draw a line between front and rear. It was also feared that combatants would follow the noncombatants and abandon the settlements. This position changed on May 15. Operation Tinok ("Baby") saw the {{evacuation of}} children from Nitzanim, Negba, Gat, Gal-On and Kfar Menahem by armored cars or by foot to places further north, where they were considered to be <b>relatively</b> <b>safer.</b> On the night of May 16–17, 35 children from Nitzanim were evacuated on foot to Be'er Tuvia.|$|R
