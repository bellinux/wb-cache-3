While Bremen is located in the comparatively cloudy northwestern part of Germany, there has been a significant increase in average sunshine hours over the last decades, especially in the months of April, May and July, causing the annual mean to rise by 62 hours between the two <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> mentioned above. This trend has continued over the last 10 years, which average 1614 hours of sunshine, a good 130 hours more than in the international reference period of 1961-90.

40|$|Current {{state-of-the-art}} {{global climate}} models produce different values for Earth’s mean temperature. When comparing simulations {{with each other}} and with observations it is standard practice to compare temperature anomalies with respect to a <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> It is not always appreciated that the choice of <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> can affect conclusions, both about the skill of simulations of past climate, and about the magnitude of expected future changes in climate. For example, observed global temperatures over the past decade are towards the lower end of the range of CMIP 5 simulations irrespective of what <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> is used, but exactly where they lie in the model distribution varies with the choice of <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> Additionally, we demonstrate that projections of when particular temperature levels are reached, for example 2 K above ‘pre-industrial’, change by up to a decade depending on the choice of <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> In this article we discuss some of the key issues that arise when using anomalies relative to a <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> to generate climate projections. We highlight that there is no perfect choice of <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> When evaluating models against observations, a long <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> should generally be used, but how long depends on the quality of the observations available. The IPCC AR 5 choice to use a 1986 - 2005 <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> for future global temperature projections was reasonable, but a case-by-case approach is needed for different purposes and when assessing projections of different climate variables. Finally, we recommend that any studies that involve the use of a <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> should explicitly examine the robustness of the conclusions to alternative choices...|$|R

40|$|Panel surveys {{generally}} {{suffer from}} “seam bias” [...] too few transitions observed within <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> {{and too many}} reported between interviews. Seam bias is likely to affect duration models severely since both the start date and the end date of a spell may be misreported. In this paper we examine the employment dynamics of disadvantaged single mothers in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) while correcting for seam bias in reported employment status. We develop parametric misreporting models for use in multi-state, multi-spell duration analysis; the models are identified if misreporting parameters are the same for fresh and left-censored spells of the same type. We extend these models to allow misreporting to depend on individual characteristics and for a certain fraction of the sample never to misreport. These extensions are informative about misreporting, but do not affect estimates of the hazard functions. We compare our results to two approaches used previously: i) using only data on the last month of <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> and ii) adding a dummy variable for the last month of the <b>reference</b> <b>periods.</b> We find that there are important differences between our estimates and those obtained from ii), and very important differences between our estimates and those obtained from i).

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{revisit the}} input–output mass {{budget of the}} high-elevation region of the Greenland ice sheet {{evaluated}} by the Program for Arctic Regional Climate Assessment (PARCA). Our revised <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> (1961 – 90) mass balance of 5448 Gt a– 1 is substantially greater than the 021 Gt a– 1 assessed by PARCA, but consistent with a recent, fully independent, input–output estimate of high-elevation mass balance (41 61 Gt a– 1). Together these estimates infer a <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> high-elevation specific mass balance of 4. 85. 4 cmw. e. a– 1. The probability density function (PDF) associated with this combined input–output estimate infers an 81 % likelihood of high-elevation specific mass balance being positive (> 0 cmw. e. a– 1) during the <b>reference</b> <b>period,</b> and a 70 % likelihood that specific balance was> 2 cmw. e. a– 1. Given that <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> accumulation is characteristic of centurial and millennial means, and that in situ mass-balance observations exhibit a dependence on surface slope rather than surface mass balance, we suggest that millennial-scale ice dynamics are the primary driver of subtle <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> high-elevation mass gain.

40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} how different <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> (i. e., calibration periods) of climate data used to estimate drought indices influence regional drought assessments. Specifically, we investigate the influences of different <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> on historical drought characteristics, such as the trend, frequency, intensity and spatial extent, using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) with a 12 -month lag (SPEI- 12), which was estimated from the datasets of the Climate Research Unit (CRU) and the University of Delaware (UDEL). For the 1901 – 1957 (P 1) and 1958 – 2014 (P 2) estimation periods, three different types of <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> are used to compute the SPEI: P 1 and P 2 together, P 1 and P 2 separately and P 1 only. Focusing on East Asia, Europe, the United States and West Africa, {{we find that the}} influence of the reference period is significant in East Asia and West Africa, with dominant drying trends from P 1 to P 2. The reference period influenced the assessment of drought characteristics, particularly the severity and spatial extent, whereas the influence on the frequency was relatively small. Finally, self-calibration, which is the most common practice for indices such as the SPEI, tends to underestimate the drought severity and spatial extent relative to the other approaches used in this study. Although the conclusions drawn in this study are limited by the use of two global datasets, they highlight the need for clarification of the reference period in drought assessments to better understand regional drought characteristics and the associated temporal changes, particularly under climate change scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Background Aggregated {{measures}} are often employed when prevalence, {{risk factors and}} consequences of alcohol use in the population are monitored. In order to avoid time-dependent bias in aggregated measures, <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> which assess alcohol use over longer time-periods or measures assessing typical alcohol use are considered superior to <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> assessing recent or current alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption in the population is found to vary through the months of the year, {{but it is not}} known whether monthly variations in actual alcohol use affects self-reports of long-term or typical alcohol consumption. Using data from a large, population-based study with data-collection over two years, the aim {{of the present study was}} to examine whether self-reported measures of alcohol use with different <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> fluctuated across the months of the year. Methods Participants in the third wave of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Survey (HUNT 3) answered questions regarding alcohol use in the last 4 weeks, weekly alcohol consumption last twelve months, typical weekly binge drinking and typical number of alcoholic drinks consumed in a 14 day period. For each of the alcohol measures, monthly variations in reporting were estimated and compared to the overall average. Results Monthly variations in self-reported alcohol use were found across all alcohol measures regardless of reference period. A general tendency was found for highest level of alcohol use being reported during the summer season, however, the highest number of individuals who reported alcohol use in the last 4 weeks was found in January. Women reported substantially larger increase in weekly binge drinking during the summer months than men. Conclusions Self-reports of alcohol use over longer time and typical alcohol use varies according to the month the respondents are assessed. Monthly variations should therefore be taken into account when designing, analyzing and interpreting data from population-based studies aimed to examine descriptive and analytical characteristics of alcohol use in the population...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES. In July 1988, a fire {{destroyed}} a huge supermarket warehouse in Richmond, Calif, sending smoke into residential neighborhoods {{for nearly a}} week.

We denote the periods with visibility below 2 km as extreme haze and refer to the rest as <b>reference</b> <b>periods.</b> During the measurements in Xi'an an extreme haze covered the city for about a week and the total non-refractory (NR) -PM 2. 5 mass fraction reached peak concentrations of over 1000 µg m − 3. During the measurements in Beijing two extreme haze events occurred, but the temporal extent and the total concentrations reached during these events were lower than in Xi'an. Average PM 2. 5 concentrations of 537 ± 146 and 243 ± 47 µg m − 3 (including NR species and equivalent black carbon, eBC) were recorded during the extreme haze events in Xi'an and Beijing, respectively. During the <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> the measured average concentrations were 140 ± 99 µg m − 3 in Xi'an and 75 ± 61 µg m − 3 in Beijing. The relative composition of the NR-PM 2. 5 evolved substantially during the extreme haze periods, with increased contributions of the inorganic components (mostly sulfate and nitrate). Our results suggest that the high relative humidity present during the extreme haze events had a strong effect on the increase of sulfate mass (via aqueous phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide). Another relevant characteristic of the extreme haze is the size of the measured particles. During the extreme haze events, the AMS showed much larger particles, with a volume weighted mode at about 800 to 1000 nm, in contrast to about 400 nm during <b>reference</b> <b>periods.</b> These large particle sizes made the use of the PM 2. 5 inlet crucial, especially during the severe haze events, where 39 ± 5...|$|E

In some conditions, dependent interviewing (providing respondents with their earlier answers) also reduced the size of the seam effect.
