40|$|The novel {{core network}} {{architecture}} {{presented in this}} paper realizes distributed all-optical switching of payload by partitioning the network into a number of geographically limited <b>domains,</b> where two-way <b>reservations</b> are effective. Thus, inside each domain, loss is eliminated, while traffic from many nodes can be aggregated into single bursts, improving efficiency. Clustered nodes contribute contiguous optical slots, which are marshaled into composite optical frames destined for other clusters, under the guidance of a reservation-based control protocol. The lossless aggregation of traffic from several core nodes allows the use of cost-effective bufferless all-optical transport among the domains with electrical buffers employed at the periphery of the system. The end result is a triple improvement in loss probabilities, efficiency, and cost. This is achieved by exploiting three features of the architecture: the distributed switching functionality (as in early LANs when centralized switching was expensive), localized reservations (avoiding the intolerable delays of end-to-end reservations), and a reduced number of source-destination pairs (by means of node clustering into <b>reservation</b> <b>domains).</b> © 2007 IEEE...|$|R

The RMD framework defines two architectural concepts: - the Per Hop Reservation (PHR) - the Per <b>Domain</b> <b>Reservation</b> (PDR) The PHR protocol is used within a Diffserv domain on a per-hop basis to augment the Diffserv Per Hop Behavior (PHB) with resource reservation.

In this study, we propose three new language modeling techniques that use semantic analysis for spoken dialog systems. We call these methods concept sequence modeling, two-level semantic-lexical modeling, and joint semantic-lexical modeling. These models combine lexical information with varying amounts of semantic information, using annotation supplied by either a shallow semantic parser or full hierarchical parser. These models also differ in how the lexical and semantic information is combined, ranging from simple interpolation to tight integration using maximum entropy modeling. We obtain improvements in recognition accuracy over word and class N-gram language models in three different task domains. Interpolation of the proposed models with class N-gram language models provides additional improvement in the air travel <b>reservation</b> <b>domain.</b> We show that as we increase the semantic information utilized and as we increase the tightness of integration between lexical and semantic items, we obtain improved performance when interpolating with class language models, indicating that the two types of models become more complementary in nature...|$|E

Although most of the notations, such as UML, are meant for modeling a single system, they can be extended to model variants. We have done that and applied such extended notations in our projects. We soon found that our models with variants were becoming overly complicated, undermining the major role of domain analysis which is understanding. One variant was often reflected in many models and any given model was affected by many variants. The number of possible variant combinations was growing rapidly and mutual dependencies among variants even further complicated the domain model. We realized that our purely descriptive domain model was only useful for small examples but it did not scale up. In this paper, we describe a modeling method and a Flexible Variant Configuration tool (FVC for short) that alleviate the above mentioned problems. In our approach, we start by modeling so-called domain defaults, i. e., requirements that characterize a typical system in a domain. Then, we describe variants as deltas in respect to domain defaults. The FVC interprets variants to produce customized domain model views for a system that meets specific requirements.

In this paper, a wireless cellular architecture overlaid with Diff-Serv domains is considered. We propose a flexible hierarchical framework for admission control based on this architecture which aims to keep the handoff dropping probability below a target level while maximizing the network utilization. The novelty of our proposal is that (1) our prediction-based admission control scheme considers not only intra-domain but also interdomain handoffs, while (2) {{it is based on}} on-line bandwidth requirement prediction, and (3) benefits from different priorities among different service classes to improve the network utilization by accommodating high-priority handoffs at the expense of dropping low-priority calls.

The architecture provides scalable per-link resource reservations in agents and low per-packet overhead in routers. The key ideas are the following. First, reservations from different sources to the same destination are aggregated as their paths merge toward the destination. Second, an agent in charge of resources at the final destination can generalize reservations for specific end-points so that they are valid for any end-point in the destination domain, thereby allowing more aggregation. Third, agents can do bulk reservations in advance with neighboring agents, thereby allowing aggregation over time. Fourth, agents are responsible for setting up policing points at edge routers for checking commitments. Agents can minimize the per-packet policing overhead in routers by varying the granularity of policing over timeGodkänd; 1998; 20080328 (ysko...|$|R

Teacher-related constraints included teachers’ low confidence in spoken English, deficiency in strategic and sociolinguistic competence, unfamiliarity with the target culture, lack of proper training in CLT, and low willingness to prepare communicative materials. Student-related constraints were mainly due to students’ insufficient proficiency, and educational-system related limitations consisting of large classes and grammar-based examinations.

The introduction of IP-based transport in Radio Access Networks (RANs) is one of these networking solutions.
