50|$|These are wave {{equations}} {{which have}} plane waves with equal propagation speed {{in the forward}} and reverse directions as solutions.

5000|$|That is, {{in regions}} of {{space where the}} {{variation}} of the atomic wavelength is significant over its own length (i.e. the gradient of [...] is steep), there is no meaning in the approximation of a local wavelength. This breakdown occurs irrespective of {{the sign of the}} potential, [...] In such regions part of the incident atom wave-function may become reflected. Such a reflection may occur for slow atoms experiencing the comparatively rapid variation of the van der Waals potential near the material surface. This is just the same kind of phenomenon as occurs when light passes from a material of one refractive index to another of a significantly different index over a small region of space. Irrespective of the sign of the difference in index, there will be a <b>reflected</b> <b>component</b> of the light from the interface. Indeed, quantum reflection from the surface of solid-state wafer allows one to make the quantum optical analogue of a mirror - the atomic mirror - to a high precision.|$|E
50|$|Razorback suckers inhabit a {{diversity}} of areas from mainstream channels to backwaters of medium and large streams or rivers. They prefer to live over sand, mud, or gravel bottoms. Razorbacks feed on algae, insect larvae, plankton, and detritus. The eyes are receptive to parts of the UV spectrum, particularly {{that portion of the}} retina that receives light from below. The razorback spends most of its life at depths where UV light cannot penetrate but they move into the shallows for breeding. In the shallows, males stake out a breeding territory and hover near the riverbed. When another male enters the breeding area, the defending male rolls his eyes downward to reveal the upper third of the eye generating a flash of reflected sunlight. The strongest <b>reflected</b> <b>component</b> of the flash lies in the UV spectrum. The intruding male, swimming overhead, can see the flash below and will shy away from it. The eye flashes are not visible from a distance underwater and can thus be used to signal intruding males without alerting predators. Females do not react to the eye flashes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the energy {{dependence}} of the time lags in Cygnus X- 1 excludes any significant contribution of the standard <b>reflected</b> <b>component</b> to the observed lags. The conclusion is valid in the 0. 1 [...] 10 Hz frequency range where time lags have been detected with high enough significance. In fact the data hint that <b>reflected</b> <b>component</b> is working in opposite direction, reducing the lags at energies where contribution of the <b>reflected</b> <b>component</b> is significant. We argue that the observed logarithmic dependence of time lags on energy {{can be understood as}} due to the small variations of the spectrum power law index in a very simple phenomenological model. We assume that an optically thin flow/corona, emitting a power law like spectrum, is present at a range of distances from the compact object. The slope of the locally emitted spectrum is a function of distance with the hardest spectrum emitted in the innermost region. If perturbations with different time scales are introduced to the accretion flow at different radii the observed X-ray lags naturally appear due to the inward propagation of perturbations on the diffusion time scales.

40|$|DPOAEs {{measured}} in the ear canal consist of two major components, one due to the nonlinearities at the overlap region between the primaries and the other due to a reflection from the DP tonotopic area. Interaction between these two components results in DPOAE fine structure (the pseudoperiodic variation of DPOAE level with frequency). The amplitudes of the two components were extracted using an IFFT of the amplitude fine-structure and phase. When primary ratio was varied (from 1. 053 to 1. 36), the amplitude of the component from the overlap region was band-pass in character with a peak near a ratio of 1. 22. The pattern was very similar in all subjects. The characteristics of the <b>reflected</b> <b>component</b> from the DP area varied considerably between subjects. The ratio-function of the <b>reflected</b> <b>component</b> was low-pass in cochleae {{with low levels of}} activity, but was band-pass in more active cochleae. The differences in the ratio-functions of the two components meant that the <b>reflected</b> <b>component</b> from the DP region was larger than the generator component at narrow ratios. The overlap component was larger at mid ratios and the relative magnitudes of the components were dependent on the activity level of the cochlea at wide ratios. Both components saturated with increasing primary levels with saturation being more pronounced for the <b>reflected</b> <b>component.</b> ^ In addition to the two principal components, internal reflections within the cochlea produced components with longer latencies leading to a rich family of fine-structure shapes. The two-source interference model as proposed by Talmadge et al. (1998) was used as a framework for experimental design and result interpretation. Although the results were in general agreement with model predictions, they pointed towards more complex mechanisms involved in the generation of DPOAEs. Implications of these results for clinical applications of DPOAEs are also discussed. ...|$|E

Radiances measured during summer Monex 1979, from Hudson Bay to Saudi Arabia, were averaged and then normalized by multiplying by pi and dividing by the scene-averaged reflected flux density.

40|$|Two-particle {{scattering}} probabilities in tunneling scenarios with exchange interaction {{are analyzed}} with quasi-particle wave packets. Two initial one-particle wave packets (with opposite central momentums) are spatially localized at {{each side of}} a barrier. After impinging upon a tunneling barrier, each wave packet splits into transmitted and <b>reflected</b> <b>components.</b> When the initial two-particle anti-symmetrical state {{is defined as a}} Slater determinant any type of (normalizable) one-particle wave packet, it is shown that the probability of detecting two (identically injected) electrons at {{the same side of the}} barrier is different from zero in very common (single or double barrier) scenarios. In some particular scenarios, the transmitted and <b>reflected</b> <b>components</b> become orthogonal and the mentioned probabilities reproduce those values associated to distinguishable particles. These unexpected non-zero probabilities are still present when non-separable Coulomb interaction or non-symmetrical potentials are considered. On the other hand, for initial wave packets close to Hamiltonian eigenstates, the usual zero two-particle probability for electrons at the same side of the barrier found in the literature is recovered. The generalization to many-particle scattering probabilities with quasi-particle wave packets for low and high phase-space density are also analyzed. The far-reaching consequences of these non-zero probabilities in the accurate evaluation of quantum noise in mesoscopic systems are briefly indicated. Comment: 32 pages 12 figure...|$|R

Two forms of reflectance distribution patterns of wall surface were examined: horizontal and vertical reflectance band variation.

40|$|Polarization in the {{telescope}} can limit high accuracy polarization measurements by introducing cross talk among the input solar Stokes parameters. The larger {{the degree of}} telescope polarization {{the more difficult it}} is to remove through calibration. This calibration itself is often difficult as it is not practical to routinely place calibration optics over the aperture of a large telescope. Even if the polarization of {{the telescope}} were perfectly calibrated, seeing-induced cross-talk can still reduce measurement accuracy. Magnitude of telescope polarization: Telescope polarization is introduced when surface light is reflected at angles other than normal. In the case of a reflecting telescope the reflected light itself is of interest. For a refracting telescope, the transmitted light with the <b>reflected</b> <b>component</b> removed is of interest. Since the <b>reflected</b> <b>component</b> is small for a lens, a refracting telescope with a similar focal ratio and geometry as a reflecting telescope has much smaller total polarization.
