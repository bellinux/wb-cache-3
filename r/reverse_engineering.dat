5|$|In a {{statement}} on its website, ReactOS cited differing legal definitions of what constitutes clean-room <b>reverse</b> <b>engineering</b> as a cause for the conflict. Some countries, including the United States, require that a reimplementation based on disassembled code must be written by someone other than the person having disassembled and examined the original code, whereas other countries allow both tasks to be performed by the same individual. Consequently, ReactOS clarified that its Intellectual Property Policy Statement requirements on clean room <b>reverse</b> <b>engineering</b> conform to US law. An internal source code audit was conducted to ensure that only clean room <b>reverse</b> <b>engineering</b> was used, and all developers were made to sign an agreement committing them {{to comply with the}} project's policies on <b>reverse</b> <b>engineering.</b> Contributors to its development were not affected by these events, and all access to the software development tools was restored shortly afterward. In September 2007, with the audit nearing completion, the audit status was removed from the ReactOS homepage. Though the audit was completed, specific details were not made public as it was only an internal effort to ensure compliance with the project's own policies.|$|E

The lucrative work was largely not innovative, but helped the Stampers learn the console's technology. After <b>reverse</b> <b>engineering</b> the hardware, Chris Stamper's proficiency {{led him to}} develop a handheld NES console prototype prior {{to the release of}} Nintendo's portable Game Boy. Chris thought that Rare's rural setting—the company was based in a farmhouse in Twycross—was relaxed and refreshing for the game development mindset. The company earned its first million-selling hit for the NES with R.C. Pro-Am in 1988. Chris later reflected that his British peers did not grasp the larger, international video game market, despite having what he considered to be the best talent.|$|E

The final 3 D CAD model is obtained in the Catia software. For the Rapid Prototyping the 3 D CAD model was 3 D printed using the FDM technology. The obtained 3 D printed master model was used to prepare a silicone mould that was subsequently used to create an identical part by the method of Soft-tooling. The original part and parts obtained by 3 D printing and moulding were compared in the GOM Inspect V 8 software by the method of Surface Analysis...|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the United States and Japan were well matched in {{aircraft}} carriers, in terms of numbers and quality. Both sides had nine, but the Mitsubishi A6M Zero carrier fighter plane was superior in terms of range and maneuverability to its American counterpart, the F4F Wildcat. By <b>reverse</b> <b>engineering</b> a captured Zero, the American engineers identified its weaknesses, such as inadequate protection for the pilot and the fuel tanks, and built the Hellcat as a superior weapon system. In late 1943 the Grumman F6F Hellcats entered combat. Powered by the same 2,000 horsepower Pratt and Whitney 18-cylinder radial engine as used by the F4U Corsair already in service with the Marine Corps and the UK's allied Fleet Air Arm, the F6Fs were faster (at 400mph) than the Zeros, quicker to climb (at 3,000 feet per minute), more nimble at high altitudes, better at diving, had more armor, more firepower (6 machine guns fired 120 bullets per second) than the Zero's two machine guns and pair of 20mm autocannon, carried more ammunition, and used a gunsight designed for deflection shooting at an angle. Although the Hellcat was heavier and had a shorter range than the Zero, on the whole it proved a far superior weapon. Japan's carrier and pilot losses at Midway crippled its offensive capability, but America's overwhelming offensive capability came from shipyards that increasingly out produced Japan's, from the refineries that produced high-octane gasoline, and from the training fields that produced much better trained pilots. In 1942 Japan commissioned 6 new carriers but lost 6; in 1943 it commissioned 3 and lost 1. The turning point came in 1944 when it added 8 and lost 13. At war's end Japan had 5 carriers tied up in port; all have been damaged, all lacked fuel and all lacked warplanes. Meanwhile, the US launched 13 small carriers in 1942 and one large one; and in 1943 added 15 large and 50 escort carriers, and more came in 1944 and 1945. The new American carriers were much better designed, with far more antiaircraft guns, and powerful radar.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Social {{networks}} {{are some of}} the largest and fastest growing online services today. Facebook, for example, has been ranked as the second most visited site on the Internet, and has been reporting growth rates as high as 3 % per week. One of the key features of social networks is the support they provide for finding new friends. For example, social network sites may try to automatically identify which users know each other in order to propose friendship recommendations. Clearly, most social network sites are critical with respect to user’s security and privacy due to the large amount of information available on them, as well as their very large user base. Previous research has shown that users of online social networks tend to exhibit a higher degree of trust in friend requests and messages sent by other users. Even though the problem of unsolicited messages in social networks (i. e., spam) has already been studied in detail, to date, <b>reverse</b> social <b>engineering</b> attacks in social networks have not received any attention. In a <b>reverse</b> social <b>engineering</b> attack, the attacker does not initiate contact with the victim. Rather, the victim is tricked into contacting the attacker herself. As a result, a high degree of trust is established between the victim and the attacker as the victim is the entity that established the relationship. In this paper, we present the first user study on <b>reverse</b> social <b>engineering</b> attacks in social networks. That is, we discuss and show how attackers, in practice, can abuse some of the friend-finding features that online social networks provide with the aim of launching <b>reverse</b> social <b>engineering</b> attacks. Our results demonstrate that <b>reverse</b> social <b>engineering</b> attacks are feasible and effective in practice...|$|R

In contrast, persuading the victim to contact the attacker by connecting with the victim’s friends through a <b>reverse</b> social <b>engineering</b> technique [8] {{is an example of}} a human-based attack in social networks.|$|R
