Rights to the remaining two, the Montreal Canadiens and Winnipeg Jets, and national cable rights to the league as a whole, were held by the competing network TSN.

500|$|On being {{filed on}} September 8, 1981, District Judge Lee Roy West recused {{himself from the}} case, being an alumnus of the University of Oklahoma for both his {{undergraduate}} and law degrees. [...] Judge Juan Guerrero Burciaga of New Mexico was then appointed to hear the case. [...] During the trial, the NCAA claimed {{that it was a}} voluntary organization and if the plaintiffs or other schools did not wish to abide by the NCAA rules, they were free to terminate their membership. [...] It was shown that the amount of money paid by ABC to teams appearing on television was established by Thomas C. Hansen, the NCAA Television Program Director. [...] Universities were not allowed to negotiate their own terms. Burciaga pointed out an example of the control and price fixing by noting that in 1981, Oklahoma and the University of Southern California (both then ranked in the top 5 of the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll) appeared on 200 stations in a <b>regional</b> <b>broadcast.</b> [...] On the same weekend, ABC televised a game between The Citadel and Appalachian State on four stations.

500|$|It was {{announced}} on January 23, 2009 that MLSE would acquire the 80.1% interest in GolTV Canada, a digital cable soccer channel, held by MLSE owner Tanenbaum through Insight Sports. [...] The channel operated as a localized version of GOL TV USA, which owned the remaining 19.9%, with focus on Toronto FC. [...] MLSE informed the CRTC in 2015 {{that it had}} acquired full ownership of the channel, however later that year they {{announced that it would}} cease operations and the license be abandoned, effective August 31, 2015. [...] In November 2009 MLSE applied to the CRTC for a Category 2 digital TV license for a general interest sports service provisionally named Mainstream Sports, which was granted in June 2010. MLSE planned to broadcast its teams' games on the channel, along the lines of team-owned regional sports networks in the United States such as YES Network and the New England Sports Network, with the tentative name [...] "Real Sports" [...] (in keeping with the branding of MLSE's sports bar and apparel store). It was never revealed whether the channel would have replaced, or supplemented, MLSE's existing digital channels. [...] Peddie credited the threat of a Real Sports channel as a motivator for Rogers and Bell, owners of sports channels Sportsnet and TSN respectively, to purchase the company due to concerns about losing the rights to broadcast MLSE teams to the channel or having to pay huge fees for them. The acquisition of MLSE by Rogers and Bell in 2012, and associated agreements to divide the company's <b>regional</b> <b>broadcast</b> rights between the two, eliminated the need for the channel and its license expired after the three-year deadline for launch passed in 2013.|$|E

His political views leaned towards the right during the early years, and Schultz told the Los Angeles Times that he [...] "lined up with the Republicans because they were anti-tax and I {{wanted to make a}} lot of money." [...] His political views became more liberal after he visited a Salvation Army cafeteria in 1998 and later took his radio show on the road riding in a 38-foot motor home. Throughout the tour, Schultz visited families in rural North Dakota and described his tour as [...] "the on-the-job experience that have changed my thinking as to where we're going as a country." ...|$|E
