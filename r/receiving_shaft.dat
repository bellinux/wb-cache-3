40|$|Thesis (MIng (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Various {{commercial}} {{software packages}} {{are available for}} simulating compressed air network operations. However, none of these software packages are able to dynamically prioritise compressor selection on large compressed air networks in the mining industry. In this dissertation, a dynamic compressor selector (DCS) will be developed that will actively and continuously monitor system demand. The software will ensure that the most suitable compressors, based on efficiency and position in the compressed air network, are always in operation. The study will be conducted at a platinum mine. Compressed air flow and pressure requirements will be maintained without compromising mine safety procedures. Significant energy savings will be realised. DCS will <b>receive</b> <b>shaft</b> pressure profiles {{from each of the}} shafts’ surface compressed air control valves. These parameters will be used to calculate and predict the compressed air demand. All pipe friction losses and leaks will be taken into account to determine the end-point pressure losses at different flow rates. DCS will then prioritise the compressors of the compressed air network based on the overall system requirement. This software combines the benefits of supply-side and demand-side management. Potential energy savings with DCS were proven and compressor cycling reduced. A DCS user-friendly interface was created to easily set up any mine’s compressed air network. Master...|$|R

60|$|The cover being now {{thoroughly}} beat by the attendants, the stag {{was compelled}} to abandon it, and trust to his speed for his safety. Three greyhounds were slipped upon him, whom he threw out, after running a couple of miles, by entering an extensive furzy brake which extended {{along the side of}} a hill. The horsemen soon came up, and casting off a sufficient number of slowhounds, sent them, with the prickers, into the cover, in order to chive the game from his strength. This object being accomplished, afforded another severe chase of several miles, in a direction almost circular, during which the poor animal tried every wile to get rid of his persecutors. He crossed and traversed all such dusty paths as were likely to retain the least scent of his footsteps; he laid himself close to the ground, drawing his feet under his belly, and clapping his nose close to the earth, lest he should be betrayed to the hounds by his breath and hoofs. When all was in vain, and he found the hounds coming fast in upon him, his own strength failing, his mouth embossed with foam, and the tears dropping from his eyes, he turned in despair upon his pursuers, who then stood at gaze, making an hideous clamour, and awaiting their two-footed auxiliaries.

60|$|Another {{and very}} {{different}} form of thunderbolt is the belemnite, a common English fossil often preserved in {{houses in the}} west country with the same superstitious reverence as the neolithic hatchets. The very form of the belemnite at once suggests {{the notion of a}} dart or lance-head, which has gained for it its scientific name. At the present day, when all our girls go to Girton and enter for the classical tripos, I need hardly translate the word belemnite 'for the benefit of the ladies,' as people used to do in the dark and unemancipated eighteenth century; but as our boys have left off learning Greek just as their sisters are beginning to act the 'Antigone' at private theatricals, I may perhaps be pardoned if I explain, 'for the benefit of the gentlemen,' that the word is practically equivalent to javelin-fossil. The belemnites are the internal shells of a sort of cuttle-fish which swam about in enormous numbers in the seas whose sediment forms our modern lias, oolite, and gault. A great many different species are known and have acquired charming names in very doubtful Attic at the hands of profoundly learned geological investigators, but almost all are equally good representatives of the mythical thunderbolt. The finest specimens are long, thick, cylindrical, and gradually tapering, with a hole at one end as if on purpose to <b>receive</b> the <b>shaft.</b> Sometimes they have petrified into iron pyrites or copper compounds, shining like gold, and then they make very noble thunderbolts indeed, heavy as lead, and capable of doing profound mischief if properly directed. At other times they have crystallised in transparent spar, and then they form very beautiful objects, as smooth and polished as the best lapidary could possibly make them. Belemnites are generally found in immense numbers together, especially in the marlstone quarries of the Midlands, and in the lias cliffs of Dorsetshire. Yet the quarrymen who find them never seem to have their faith shaken in the least by the enormous quantities of thunderbolts that would appear to have struck a single spot with such extraordinary frequency This little fact also tells rather hardly against the theory that the lightning never falls twice upon the same place.|$|R
40|$|Layer 1 of {{the cortex}} {{contains}} populations of neurochemically distinct neurons and afferent fibres which markedly affect neural {{activity in the}} apical dendritic tufts of pyramidal cells. Understanding the causal mechanisms requires knowledge of the cellular architecture and synaptic organisation of layer 1. This study has identified 8 morphological classes of calretinin immunopositive (CRet+) neurons (including Cajal-Retzius cells) in layer 1 of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in adult monkey (Macaca fasicularis), with a distinct class - termed ‘subpial fan (SPF) cell’ - described in detail. SPF cells were rare horizontal unipolar CRet+ cells located directly beneath the pia with a single thick primary dendrite that branched into a characteristic fan-like dendritic tree tangential to the pial surface. Dendrites had spines, filamentous processes and thorny branchlets. SPF cells lay millimetres apart with axons that ramified widely in upper layer 1. Such cells were GABA immunonegative (-) and occurred in areas beyond PFC. Interspersed amidst SPF cells displaying normal structural integrity were degenerating CRet+ neurons (including SPF cells) and clumps of lipofuscin-rich cellular debris. The number of degenerating SPF cells increased during adulthood. Ultrastructural analyses indicated SPF cell somata received asymmetric (A - presumed excitatory) and symmetric (S - presumed inhibitory) synaptic contacts. Proximal dendritic <b>shafts</b> <b>received</b> mainly S-type and distal shafts mostly A-type input. All dendritic thorns and most dendritic spines received both synapse types. The tangential areal density of SPF cell axonal varicosities varied radially from parent somata - with dense clusters in more distal zones. All boutons formed A-type contacts with CRet- structures. The main post-synaptic targets were dendritic shafts (67 %; mostly spine-bearing) and dendritic spines (24 %). SPF-SPF cell innervation was not observed. Morphometry of SPF cells indicated a unique class of CRet+/GABA- neuron in adult monkey PFC – possibly a subtype of persisting Cajal-Retzius cell. The distribution and connectivity of SPF cells suggest they act as integrative hubs in upper layer 1 during postnatal maturation. The main synaptic output of SPF cells likely provides a transminicolumnar excitatory influence across swathes of apical dendritic tufts - thus affecting information processing in discrete patches of layer 1 in adult monke...|$|R
50|$|Up to {{the twelfth}} century {{the windows of the}} Romesque churches had small {{openings}} for light, a sloping intrados, and an inclined sill. Originally without decoration, they later received a framework, that is, they were surrounded by a border of slender shafts as by a frame. In the further development these round <b>shafts</b> <b>received</b> small bases and capitals, the intrados was divided into rectangular intervals in which small columns were set. Gothic art adopted this framework, merely changing the round arch into a pointed one, and later replacing the rectangular intervals of the intrados by flutings. As the style grew the small capitals of the round shafts were abandoned and later the shafts themselves, by which the style returned to the simple framework. The late Gothic ceased to use even the framework and employed the sloping intrados alone, without further ornament. Naturally there were innumerable exceptions to the development sketched here only in its general features. In Romanesque art the sills had originally only a slight inclination. This gradually became greater until it became more than a right angle. Characteristic of the Romanesque style is the grouping together of two to four windows, the so-called clustered window. Above the window the flat surface of the arch remained without ornamentation or was pierced by small round windows. Romanesque art used, in addition to windows enclosed by the round arch, others surrounded by the trefoil or fan-arch, and even openings for light entirely Baroque in design with arbitrarily curved arches. In the Gothic period the windows were longer and broader, in a number of cathedrals they almost replace the walls. Although the clustered window with three openings did not entirely disappear, yet it was more customary to use two narrow windows combined by a common shaft and a common pointed arch above them. The shafts grew constantly more slender and a circular arch was introduced under the pointed arch. This led in the course of time to the appearance of tracery which was so largely used in window ornamentation in the Gothic period that it became almost the most important consideration in the construction of windows. Tracery is formed by setting together separate parts of a circle called foils; their points of contact are named cusps. By means of tracery the pointed arches of the windows were constantly filled with new forms and devices, simple in the early Gothic, artificial and confused the more the style developed, until finally in the late Gothic or Flamboyant style the wavy tracery was used which no longer consisted of circles and segments of circles but assumed forms comparable to flames, a style particularly in vogue in England and France. Towards the end of the Gothic period greater sobriety of form came into use and tracery began to decline. The elaboration undergone by the tracery was also shared by the shafts of the windows and intrados. Undivided at first they gradually received richer contours and were separated into main and subordinate pillars. The earliest tracery of which the date is known is that still existing in the choir chapels of the Reims Cathedral (1211).|$|R
40|$|The {{electron}} microscope {{has been used}} to study the normal structure of the motor cortex (area 4 of Brodmann) and area 3 b of the somatic sensory cortex in the monkey. The termination of the thalamo-cortical and commissural afferent fibres to both cortical areas, and the association connections to the motor cortex from the somatic sensory cortex and area 6 have been studied in experimental material. Because previous {{electron microscope}} studies have been mostly of sensory or parietal cortical areas the emphasis throughout this study has been on the structure and connections of the motor cortex and the somatic sensory cortex has been studied primarily to give a comparison with a different cortical area. The general ultrastructural appearance of the motor cortex and area 3 b of the somatic sensory cortex is remarkably similar. The neuropil of all layers consists predominantly of axon terminals and dendritic spines together with dendritic shafts, myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Layer I of both cortical areas contains a plexus of myelinated axons which was shown by light and electron microscopy to be markedly more dense in the motor cortex than in the somatic sensory cortex, although the diameters of the myelinated axons in both areas were similar. In layers II and III there are numerous neurons between which run vertical lengths of apical dendrite and these layers contain relatively few myelinated axons compared to the deeper layers of the cortex. Layer IV, in both the motor and somatic sensory cortices, contains conspicuous stellate cell somata which receive large numbers of synapses and in the motor cortex these extend both above and below the narrow layer IV which is conventionally described. There is a considerable {{increase in the number of}} myelinated axons at and below this level in the cortex and in sections of layer IV cut parallel to the pial surface the apical dendrites which run vertically through layer IV may be seen to occur in bundles of six to twelve dendrites. Layer V contains the prominent Betz cells and similar, but smaller, large pyramidal cells are present in layer V of the somatic sensory cortex. Both layers V and VI contain predominantly pyramidal and fusiform cells and these layers in the motor cortex are considerably thicker than in the somatic 'sensory cortex, this difference accounting for most of the difference in overall thickness between the two cortical areas. Pyramidal and stellate cell types have previously been recognised in the neocortex with the electron microscope. A detailed study has been made here of the neuronal somata in the sensori-motor cortex. Pyramidal cells in the motor cortex are very similar to those described previously in sensory and parietal cortical areas. The largest pyramidal cells in area 4, the Betz cells of layer V, are up to 50 andnbsp;andmu; in transverse diameter. Although basically resembling smaller pyramidal cells, the nucleus of a Betz cell often has a complex indentation and is smaller in relation to the overall size of the cell soma than, is that of a smaller, pyramid and the cytoplasm of Betz cells contains discrete clumps of endoplasmic reticulum. As with other pyramidal cells, the synapses on to Betz cell somata are all of the symmetrical type. Previous descriptions of stellate cells have been of cells receiving a high density of axosomatic synapses of both the asymmetric and symmetrical type. Cells like this are found both in the motor and somatic sensory cortices and have been termed here large stellate cells. In addition to their high density of axosomatic synapses, they have abundant cytoplasm full of organelles and usually containing stacks of endoplasmic reticulum. Their dendrites similarly receive a high density of asymmetric and symmetrical synapses and contain prominent organelles and have a moderately varicose shape. Large stellate cells occur predominantly in layer IV in area 3 b but in the motor cortex they are also found commonly in the lower part of layer III and the upper part of layer V. A third class of neuron has been described in both the motor and somatic sensory cortices and cells of this type have been termed small stellate cells. These receive a low density of axosomatic synapses, but some of these are of the asymmetric type, and they have sparse cytoplasm with few organelles. They have a small rounded or fusiform soma, they frequently have a dark nucleus, they have no apical dendrite and their axon initial segments are thin and may be directed towards the cortical surface. Most of the rounded small stellate cells occur in layer II whereas those with fusiform somata occur more in the deeper layers of the cortex. A quantitative study was made of the cells in a strip of the same width running through the full depth of the cortex in both cortical areas. The absolute numbers of cells in the strips of the motor and somatic sensory cortices were very similar as were the proportions of each type of neuron, 72 % being pyramidal in each area with 21 % being small stellate and 7 % being large stellate in the motor cortex and 23 % small stellate and 5 % large stellate in area 3 b. The quantitative study also provided evidence that large and small stellate cells form two distinct populations rather than being a continuum. The axon initial segments of cells of all three types have a membrane undercoating and bundles of neurotubules. Those of pyramidal cells are directed towards the white matter whereas those of large and small stellate cells often run obliquely or towards the cortical surface and may be curved. Pyramidal initial segments may have spines which receive symmetrical synapses as do the shafts of the initial segments. The full length of the initial segment was studied for fourteen pyramidal and two large stellate cells. All gave rise to myelinated axons although two pyramidal cells had lengths of unmyelinated axon between the initial segment and myelinated axon. One of these lengths of unmyelinated axon made an asymmetric synapse on to a dendrite just after losing its initial segment features. Quantitative analysis of these complete initial segments showed that, whereas the diameter of the initial segment and the axon it gave rise to were approximately proportional to the size of the parent cell soma over a considerable range of cell diameters, the length of the initial segment appeared to be unrelated to either its diameter or the size of its parent soma but varied between 30 andnbsp;andmu; and 55 andnbsp;andmu; apparently at random. Synapses were evenly distributed along the full length of the complete pyramidal initial segments, but the density of synapses on the initial segments of supragranular pyramids was about three times that on those of infragranular pyramids and cisternal organs were similarly more frequent in the initial segments of supragranular pyramids. Both cisternal organs in axon initial segments and subsurface cisternae in cell somata and dendrites have been found to be related to axon terminals making symmetrical synapses on to these same structures. The cisternal organ or the dense plate of the subsurface cistern is closely apposed to the overlying plasma membrane opposite the non-synaptic part of the symmetrical axon terminal and the membranes of both the terminal and initial segment, soma or dendrite may show some degree of specialisation at this site, The dense plates of both cisternal organs and subsurface cisternae are specifically stained by ethanolic phosphotungstic acid, thus resembling the spine apparatus, and it is suggested that the role of all three structures is similar. Ethanolic phosphotungstic acid also stains the membrane undercoating of axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier, cilia, nucleoli and degenerating axons and axon terminals as well as the synaptic membrane complexes. Dendro-dendritic synapses have been observed infrequently in the deep layers of the motor cortex. The presynaptic dendrites are of a varicose type and themselves receive a considerable density of synapses both of the asymmetric and symmetrical type. The ultrastructure of the dendro-dendritic synapse itself shows the typical arrangement of pre- and postsynaptic membrane densities, often with presynaptic dense projections, and the membrane specialisation is of the symmetrical type. There is the usual cleft containing electron-dense material between the pre- and postsynaptic profiles. The synaptic vesicles occur in a small cluster confined to a region close to the presynaptic membrane specialisation; some of the vesicles are flattened and were shown by tilt analysis to be of the discoid type. Two examples were found of reciprocal dendro-dendritic synapses, both components being of the symmetrical type, and a single axon terminal may make a synapse on to both dendrites involved in a dendro-dendritic synapse. Gap junctions have been found infrequently between two dendrites or a dendrite and a cell soma in the deep layers of both the motor and somatic sensory cortices. At these junctions the outer leaflets of the plasma membranes of both profiles are intimately apposed with a gap of 2 nm between them which shows a structure of hexagonal subunits in tangential sections. These gap junctions occur mainly between the dendrites or dendrites and somata of large stellate cells but are also associated in some examples with a dendro-dendritic synapse and thus occur between large stellate dendrites and presynaptic dendrites; a desmosome may also occur in association with a gap junction and dendro-dendritic synapse. Gap junctions have been identified as sites of electrical transmission between cells in a number of sites and it is therefore suggested that some neurons in the sensori-motor cortex are electrotonically coupled. Study of the process of degeneration in the sensori-motor cortex has shown the degeneration to be mainly of the dark type with shrinkage and engulfment by glia. Micropinocytosis of degeneration has been observed and both glial profiles and dendrites, spines and neuronal somata have been observed to be taking up degeneration by this process. Similar micropinocytosis has also been observed in which a normal neuronal profile is apparently engulfing a small portion of another normal neuronal profile. Exposed postsynaptic membrane specialisations have been seen following lesions and are frequently associated with a subsurface cistern in an apposed profile. Following large, stereotaxically placed thalamic lesions the degeneration in the motor and somatic sensory cortices was studied with the electron microscope at survival periods of 4 and 5 days. Degenerating thalamo-cortical terminals had asymmetric membrane specialisations. In the motor cortex 89. 5 % made synapses on to dendritic spines, 9 % on to dendritic shafts and 1. 5 % on to cell somata and in area 3 b 89 % made synapses on to spines, 11 % on to dendritic shafts and one example contacted a cell soma and a spine. A considerable number of the spines receiving synapses from degenerating thalamo-cortical terminals were traced to their parent dendrites and these were of the pyramidal type whereas the dendritic shafts and cell somata contacted by degenerating thalamo-cortical terminals were mostly of the large stellate type. Most of the thalamo-cortical degeneration in both cortical areas occurred in a dense band in the upper two-thirds of layer IV and the lower half of layer III but a number of degenerating terminals were found deep to this and in the motor cortex a second, less dense band of degeneration was present in the lower part of layer V and top of layer VI. Degenerating thalamo-cortical terminals making synapses on to dendritic shafts and cell somata were scattered through the deep half of the cortex and not concentrated in the dense band of degeneration and so formed a greater proportion of the degeneration in the deep layers, particularly in the motor cortex. Sections cut parallel to the pial surface in layer IV of the motor cortex showed a statistically significant association between the degenerating thalamo-cortical axon terminals and the bundles of apical dendrites present at this level. Degeneration of commissural fibres was studied at 4, 5 and 6 days after removal of the contralateral sensori-motor cortex. Degenerating terminals had asymmetric membrane specialisations. In the motor cortex 96 % made synapses on to dendritic spines, 3 % contacted dendritic shafts and one example made an axosomatic synapse; in area 3 b, 97 % made synapses on to dendritic spines and 3 % contacted dendritic shafts. A number of the spines receiving synapses from degenerating commissural axon terminals were traced to their parent dendrites and these were of the pyramidal type. The cell soma and the majority of the dendritic <b>shafts</b> <b>receiving</b> synapses from commissural terminals were of the large stellate type although some of the dendritic shafts were probably those of small stellate cells. In the motor cortex degenerating commissural axon terminals were found in all cortical layers but were relatively more dense in layer I, the upper part of layer III, the upper part of layer V and the lowest part -of layer V with layer VI; in area 3 b most degenerating commissural terminals were found in the superficial half of the cortex. Following lesions of the primary somatic sensory cortex (SI) or of area 6 of the premotor cortex degenerating terminals making asymmetric synapses were found in the motor cortex. Of the terminals of association fibres from SI, 82 % made synapses on to dendritic spines and 18 % on to dendritic shafts and of those of fibres from area 6, 76 % made synapses on to dendritic spines and 24 % on to dendritic shafts. For both these association fibre connections a proportion of the dendritic shafts contacted were clearly identifiable as those of large stellate cells. Terminals of both association connections occurred in all cortical layers with no obvious concentrations at any particular depth. The normal and experimental results have been discussed together and in relation to the physiology of the motor cortex. On the basis of these results a simple model of cortical circuitry has been proposed and its properties have been explored to see what aspects of normal and abnormal cortical function can be simulated. </p...|$|R
