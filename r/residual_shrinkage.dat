40|$|We {{review and}} re-examine the {{development}} of the hydrostatics of swelling soils, starting with the pioneering work of John R. Philip. His early attempts to formulate the overburden potential of the soil water as an additional component to the pressure and gravitational potentials did cause some confusion, until it became clear that there is no additional component and that the actual pressure potential can be split into two parts: the (non-actual) pressure potential the soil water would have if the system were unloaded, and a remaining part, which may be called the overburden potential. Using fundamental thermodynamics it is then shown how the overburden potential can be calculated from the slopes of the bundle of load-pressure-dependent shrinkage curves. A set of experimental data published by Talsma is used to test the Groenevelt-Bolt equation of state for the bundle of shrinkage curves and for the numerical values of the overburden potentials for Talsma's clay paste.

40|$|International audienceThe {{shrinkage}} {{characteristics of}} buffer-backfilling materials {{play an important}} role in the security and stability of the high-level radioactive waste geological disposal system. COx argillite is considered as a kind of potential buffer-backfilling materials in France. In this investigation, both the initially saturated compacted COx specimens and the paste-like COx specimens are prepared and subjected to different test methods to study their volumetric shrinkage behaviours. For the compacted specimens, it is found that the volumetric shrinkage deformation is significantly influenced by the initial dry density; the shrinkage limit, shrinkage efficiency and shrinkage strain decrease with the increasing dry density; in addition, it is observed that the shrinkage direction of specimens shows obvious anisotropism. For example, at low degree of compaction, the radial shrinkage strain is higher than axial shrinkage strain, and the shrinkage geometry factor is larger than 3; however, the contrary results are obtained at high degree of compaction. For the paste-like specimens, three shrinkage stages can be distinguished: normal shrinkage, <b>residual</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and zero shrinkage; most of the volume shrinkage deformation occurs before the air-entry point while the soil is still fully saturated.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{selective}} laser melting (SLM), an additive manufacturing technique employed to produce metallic components, on the mechanical properties of the Al- 12 Si alloy is investigated, with particular emphasis on understanding the effect of laser track direction on quasi-static tensile, fracture, fatigue crack growth, and unnotched fatigue properties. The effect of post-SLM heat treatment {{as well as the}} scanning strategy (linear vs. checker board hatch style) was examined and the results are compared with those obtained on specimens produced through the conventional casting route. The SLM alloys exhibit a mesostructure, in addition to the fine, supersaturated Al-rich cellular structure with Si particles along the boundaries. While the latter imparts high strength at the cost of ductility, the mesostructure, which arises due to the laser track hatching, causes the crack path to be tortuous, and in turn leads to substantial increase in fracture toughness. This imparts significant anisotropy to fracture while tensile properties are nearly-isotropic. The unnotched studies reveal that the tensile <b>residual</b> stresses, <b>shrinkage</b> porosity, and unmelted powder particles, can degrade the unnotched highest fatigue properties considerably and hence need be eliminated for high fatigue strength. The SLM process offers new avenues for material design that would exploit the micro- and meso-structures generated by the process for simultaneous enhancement in strength and toughness.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine if the manufacturer's claims for a soil-release-finished fabric were true and to determine if the finished fabrics were satisfactory from the consumers' point of view. Differently colored (white, blue and yellow) blouses constructed from soil-release-finished polyester knit fabrics and comparable unfinished polyester knit fabrics were worn by six women for 24 wearings each. For comparison purposes, test specimens cut from each fabric were laundered but not worn, and test specimens were neither worn nor laundered, but were used as controls. The participants in the wear study found that the soil-release-finished blouses were more comfortable to wear in terms of temperature and water-carrying properties than the unfinished blouses. The white test specimens after 24 launderings had the greatest change in color as perceived by consumers. Reflectance readings found this to hold true for the soil-release-finished fabrics, but showed that the greatest change in color for the unfinished fabrics occurred with the color yellow. The greatest change in color for the blouses as perceived by consumers was for the color blue. This was consistent with the reflectance readings. Consumers would accept a change in color if it were uniform within the garment more readily than they would if the two pieces were in one garment. From reflectance readings it was found that there was a difference in color on the original fabrics due to the soil-release finish. There were indications that the soil-release-finished blouses had a greater tendency to pill than the unfinished blouses. Consumers rated the blouses made from the soil-releasefinished fabrics as having better soil-release than the unfinished blouses. Artificially soiled soil-release-finished specimens had considerably less soil build-up after laundering than the unfinished sample. There was no soil redeposited during laundering on the soilrelease- finished fabric. There was a loss of durable press appearance due to the soilrelease finish. <b>Residual</b> <b>shrinkage</b> occurred through the entire 24 launderings {{with the exception of the}} white fabrics (warp knit construction) in the course direction.

When an {{amputation}} of a {{lower limb}} occurs, forces due to walking are absorbed by the soft tissues of the residual limb. Due to the soft tissues of the limb no being accustomed to handling such high forces, {{one of the major}} issues that occurs is <b>residual</b> limb <b>shrinkage.</b> As the amount of pressure fluctuates, so does the balance between the fluids in the body. Shrinkage of the limb can lead to many issues such as damage to the limb and an uncomfortable socket fit. Currently, vacuum suspension is the leading method to compensate for limb volume changes. However, vacuum suspension has many flaws as well. There is a need for a new prosthetic suspension system with the capability to adjust and control the pressure at different points in the prosthetic. In this study, a new magnetic suspension system for lower limb prosthetics was designed and tested. This magnetic suspension system for lower-limb prosthetics uses electromagnets to control the amount of force exerted on the residual limb. When the electromagnets are turned on, they will attract the material on the liner, thus creating a secure attachment. The design incorporates an Arduino microprocessor and a motor driver to control the amount of negative pressure by the electromagnets. In this study, the physical model of the socket was prototyped and the strength of the electromagnetic suspension system was tested in an Instron testing machine. An amplified circuit was designed to control the electromagnetic attractive force based on the output of force sensors attached inside the socket. As the pressure decreased in the socket due to limb shrinkage, the electromagnets were programmed to inversely increase attractive force. The Arduino microprocessor and motor driver were used to adjust the power delivered to the electromagnets. This feedback loop was tested to ensure proper function. After reviewing all the results, it was found that an array of electromagnetics provided adequate force for attachment of the socket to the liner. The system was also capable of varying the attractive forces at different points based on the force sensor output.

40|$|Measurements of {{soil water}} storage {{are hard to}} obtain on scales {{relevant}} for water management and policy making. Therefore, this research develops a new measurement methodology for soil water storage estimation in clay containing soils. The proposed methodology relies on the speciﬁc property of clay soils to shrink when drying and to swell when (re-) wetted, and the capabilities of a remote sensing technique called satellite based radar interferometry (InSAR) to measure centimetre to millimetre scale displacements of the soil surface. The objective of this thesis was to develop the application of InSAR for soil water storage change estimation on the ﬁeld scale to regional scale. Two relations are investigated: 1) the relation between water storage change and surface elevation change {{as a result of}} swelling and shrinkage of a clayey soil; and 2) the relation between these surface elevation changes and InSAR phase observations. The shrinkage potential of the soil is very important for successful application of radar interferometry to measure vertical deformation as a result of swelling and shrinkage of clay. Therefore, the shrinkage potential and the water storage change-volume change relation (called the soil shrinkage characteristic, SSC) have been quantiﬁed in the laboratory for clay aggregates from the study area in the Purmer, the Netherlands. The clay content of the sampled soil ranged from 3. 4 to 23. 6 %. The aggregates had moderate shrinkage potential over the soil moisture content range from saturation to air-dryness. Shrinkage phases were distinguished based on the portion of water content change that was compensated by volume change. Approximately 40 - 50 % of water was released in the normal shrinkage phase, where loss of water is fully compensated by volume change. However, the <b>residual</b> <b>shrinkage</b> phase, where volume change is smaller than water content change, started at approx. 50 % normalized soil moisture content (actual moisture content with respect to the moisture content at saturation). In case of normal shrinkage, soil water storage change can be directly derived from soil volume change. If additionally, clay shrinkage is isotropic, the soil water storage change can be derived from vertical shrinkage measurements. The range of normal and isotropic shrinkage has been assessed in a drying ﬁeld soil in the study area. To do so, soil water storage change was derived from soil moisture content sensors and groundwater level, and volume change estimates were obtained from soil layer thickness change measurements by ground anchors. Unlike for the aggregates, normal shrinkage was not observed for the ﬁeld soil, but rather a large degree of linear (basic) shrinkage was observed. In the upper soil layers in the ﬁeld, normalized soil moisture content below 50 % has been observed when drying out. Based on the aggregate SSC, this indicates the occurrence of residual and zero shrinkage in this situation, resulting in less than normal shrinkage when the total unsaturated zone is considered. The water content change-volume change relation thus depends on the scale considered. It was also found that the relation depends on drying intensity, from comparison between shrinkage in a period with prolonged drying and shrinkage in a period with alternating drying end re-wetting. For the ﬁeld soil, volume change larger than soil water storage change was observed when assuming isotropic shrinkage. This unrealistic result made clear that the assumption of isotropic shrinkage is invalid. Therefore a correction of the shrinkage geometry factor rs, including dependence of shrinkage geometry on soil moisture content, has been proposed. This correction yielded rs-values between 1. 38 and 3. Dynamics of subsidence porosity (i. e. vertical shrinkage) calculated from the aggregate SSC, and comparison with surface elevation change data from the ﬁeld study also indicated rs-values smaller than 3. Values of rs below 3, indicate that vertical shrinkage (subsidence) is dominant over horizontal shrinkage (cracking). Satellite based radar interferometry was applied to measure vertical deformation resulting from clay shrinkage, and evaluate the potential for soil water storage change estimation on the ﬁeld scale to regional scale. Phase diﬀerences between adjacent ﬁelds were observed in interferograms over the Purmer area which were hypothesised to be caused by relative motion of the surface level. The combination of a sequence of interferograms covering short time intervals and measurements of soil surface elevation changes in time from ground anchors, indeed revealed similar dynamics in both data. Relative changes between ﬁelds in winter were explained by a diﬀerent eﬀect of frost heave in a bare soil and in a soil permanently covered by grass. Noise in interferograms over agricultural ﬁelds was successfully reduced, by multilooking over entire ﬁelds. The eﬀect of soil type and land use on phase observation was qualitatively assessed, indicating that agricultural crop ﬁelds oﬀer the best phase estimates in winter, while grass ﬁelds are more coherent in summer. The results underline the need for careful selection of agricultural ﬁelds or areas to base InSAR analysis on. The diﬀerential analysis between ﬁelds was extended to time series analysis of phase, to obtain deformation estimates with respect to a stable reference, including correction for unwanted phase contributions and temporal phase unwrapping. The correction of unwanted phase contributions speciﬁcally included the soil moisture dielectric effect. This eﬀect was considered by predicting interferometric phase based on in situ measured soil moisture contents. The soil moisture dielectric eﬀect was shown to be much smaller than shrinkage phase in our case study. A simple model was developed to estimate vertical shrinkage, using assumption on shrinkage behaviour (normal and isotropic shrinkage) and an approximation of water storage change from precipitation and evapotranspiration data.   Using this model, temporal phase unwrapping results were corrected. The corrections for soil moisture dielectric phase and the correction of phase unwrapping both improved vertical shrinkage measurements from InSAR. The results in this thesis make clear that vertical clay shrinkage can be estimated from InSAR. At the same time, these results show that clay shrinkage is a considerable phase contribution to interferometric phase and can therefore cause unwrapping and interpretation errors when not accounted for. To estimate vertical clay shrinkage from InSAR, a shrinkage model including assumptions of normal and isotropic shrinkage, proved useful in the phase unwrapping procedure in this case study.   However, using the same assumptions to compute water storage change from these InSAR estimates, will in many cases produce inaccurate results. Therefore, in order to use InSAR for estimating soil water storage change in clay soils, the soil shrinkage characteristic, soil moisture dependency of the shrinkage geometry factor, and the eﬀect of variable drying and wetting conditions, need to be considered...|$|E

Includes bibliographical references. <b>Residual</b> limb <b>shrinkage</b> is a {{major concern}} for {{prosthetic}} users with below the knee amputations. The remaining limb will shrink as the fluid is squeezed out as an amputee walks and applies forces to the remaining limb throughout the day. This shrinkage can lead to a loss of orientation control, uncomfortable socket fit and possibly limb tissue damage. Vacuum control is the leading method for dealing with the limb shrinkage but lacks fine control. The system proposed uses electromagnets to add regional control while also being used to help with suspension of the limb. The rest of the system consists of pressure sensors, a microcontroller, and additional circuits to amplify the sensor outputs and control the amount of power to the magnets. The microcontroller reads the decreased pressure and sends additional power to the magnets of that region and vice versa. A prototype system had already been devised and initial tests were done on it. However the component used to drive the electromagnets was overly complex and limited in the number of magnets that it could drive. To replace this component a simple driving circuit was devised and as many as 12 of these circuits would be able to fit onto the prototyping breadboard. The controllers coding had also been started but it too was more complicated than it needed to be. The arduino control code was simplified and expanded to control 8 magnet/sensor pairs. To tests if our proposed system could work as a suspension system, we conducted two tests. The first was a tension test that would see if the magnets could suspend the weight of the limb and test the control system within the socket. The second was a pressure test to check the responses of the control system. Both test showed that the control system was working properly and that the magnets would be enough to act as a suspension system for the prosthetic limb. However, while building and testing the prototype it was concluded that while the control system and the electromagnets work as proposed, the electromagnets are large and cumbersome. Future work using the newer technology of electrostatic adhesion was proposed. It would use the same control idea of this system, to achieve a less bulky design...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} use of high-performance, low water-to-cement (w/c) ratio concretes has led to increased occurrences of early-age shrinkage cracking in civil engineering structures. To reduce the magnitude of early-age shrinkage {{and the potential for}} cracking, mitigation strategies using shrinkage reducing admixtures (SRAs), saturated lightweight aggregates, expansive cements and extended moist curing durations in construction have been recommended. However, to appropriately utilize these strategies, {{it is important to have}} a complete understanding of the driving forces of early-age volume change and how these methods work from a materials perspective to reduce shrinkage. This dissertation uses a first-principles approach to understand the mechanism of shrinkage reducing admixtures (SRAs) to generate an expansion and mitigate shrinkage at early-ages, quantify the influence of a CaO-based expansive additive in reducing unrestrained <b>shrinkage,</b> <b>residual</b> stress development and the cracking potential at early-ages and quantify the influence of shrinkage reducing admixtures (SRAs) and cement hydration (pore structure refinement) on the reduction induced in the fluid transport properties of the material. ^ The effects of shrinkage reducing admixtures (SRAs) are described in terms of inducing autogenous expansions in cement pastes at early ages. An evaluation comprising measurements of autogenous deformation, x-ray diffraction (Rietveld analysis), pore solution and thermogravimetric analysis and electron microscopy is performed to understand the chemical nature and physical effects of the expansion. Thermodynamic calculations performed on the measured liquid-phase compositions indicate the SRA produces elevated Portlandite super-saturations in the pore solution which results in crystallization stress driven expansions. The thermodynamic calculations are supported by deformation measurements performed on cement pastes mixed in solutions saturated with Portlandite or containing additional Sodium Hydroxide. Further, to quantify the influence of temperature on volume changes in SRA containing materials, deformation measurements are performed at different temperatures. The results indicate maturity transformations are incapable of simulating volume changes over any temperature regime due to the influence of temperature on salt solubility and pore solution composition, crystallization stresses and self-desiccation. ^ The performance of a CaO-based expansive additive is evaluated over a range of additive concentrations and curing conditions to quantify the reduction in restrained and unrestrained volume changes effected in low w/c cement pastes. The results suggest, under unrestrained sealed conditions the additive generates an expansion and reduces the magnitude of total shrinkage experienced by the material. However, the extent of drying shrinkage developed is noted to be similar in all systems and independent of the additive dosage. Under restrained sealed conditions, the additive induces a significant compressive stress which delays tensile stress development in the system. However, a critical additive concentration (around four percent) needs to be exceeded to appreciably reduce the risk of cracking at early-ages. ^ The influence of shrinkage reducing admixtures (SRAs) is quantified in terms of the effects of SRA addition on fluid transport in cement-based materials. The change in the cement paste 2 ̆ 7 s pore solution properties, i. e., the surface tension and fluid-viscosity, induced by the addition of a SRA is observed to depress the fluid-sorption and wetting moisture diffusion coefficients, with the depression being a function of the SRA concentration. The experimental results are compared to analytical descriptions of water sorption and a good correlation is observed. These results allow for the change in pore-solution and fluid-transport properties to be incorporated from a fundamental perspective in models which aim to describe the service-life of structures. ^ Several experimental techniques such as chemical shrinkage, low temperature calorimetry and electrical impedance spectroscopy are evaluated in terms of their suitability to identify capillary porosity depercolation in cement pastes.
