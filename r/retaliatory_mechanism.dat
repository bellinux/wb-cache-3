The audio trigger event, for example, can be a gun shot, and the system's response is to fire back at the source. The proposed system uses microcontrollers to digitally process audio signals coming from the audio trigger. Once the event is detected, the location of that source relative to the base location is estimated and retaliatory measures are automatically activated by the system. In our study, gunshot sounds are replaced by recorded audio tones and the <b>retaliatory</b> <b>mechanism</b> consists of a Nerf dart being fired toward the sound source. Sound localization is achieved via time stamping the digitized microphone signals. With an array of microphones, angular components as well as radial components can be determined. Servo motors are used to control the turret type mechanism for firing back Nerf darts to the source. The project has potentials for both lethal and non-lethal responses to a firearm discharge. The work is based on a 2013 senior undergraduate capstone project...|$|E
5000|$|AIR ran a Defense Department-funded {{counter-insurgency}} {{program in}} Thailand during the Vietnam War years, which involved designing programs that supported [...] "assassinating key spokesmen and strengthening <b>retaliatory</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and similar preventative measures." [...] Charles Murray, the controversial political scientist, {{worked on this}} AIR program and claimed the experience was formative in his later advocacy.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{considers}} {{the use of}} the trade preference program as a tool to pressure a State to comply with its international law obligations. Recent international investment disputes involving Argentina, Ecuador, and the Russian Federation bring to light the increasing utility of U. S. and EU trade preference programs as <b>retaliatory</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for such noncompliance. Particularly where a host State either has not consented to arbitration or has allegedly failed to comply with an adverse award, this Article affirms that the trade preference program can have a meaningful impact on a host State and be a valuable tool for a foreign investor...|$|R
40|$|Positive and {{negative}} reinforcing systems {{are part of}} the mechanism of drug dependence. Drugs with abuse potential may change the manner of response to negative emotional stimuli, activate positive emotional reactions and possess primary reinforcing properties. Catecholaminergic and peptidergic processes are of importance in these mechanisms. Current research needs to understand the types of adaptations that underlie the particularly long-lived aspects of addiction. Presently, glutamate is candidate {{to play a role in}} the enduring effects of drugs of abuse. For example, it participates in the chronic pathological changes of corticostriatal terminals produced by methamphetamine. At the synaptic level, a link between over-activation of glutamate receptors, [C(a 2 +) ](i) increase and neuronal damage has been clearly established leading to neurodegeneration. Thus, neurodegeneration can start after an acute over-stimulation whose immediate effects depend on a diversity of calcium-activated mechanisms. If sufficient, the initial insult results in calcification and activation of a chronic on-going process with a progressive loss of neurons. At present, long-term effects of drug dependence underlie an excitotoxicity process linked to a polysynaptic pathway that dynamically regulates synaptic glutamate. <b>Retaliatory</b> <b>mechanisms</b> include energy capability of the neurons, inhibitory systems and cytoplasmic calcium precipitation as part of the neuron-glia interactions. This paper presents an integrated view of these molecular and cellular mechanisms to help understand their relationship and interdependence in a chronic pathological process that suggest new targets for therapeutic intervention...|$|R
2500|$|Another early {{landmark}} {{case was}} Commission v Luxembourg & Belgium (1964), the [...] "Dairy Products" [...] case. In that decision the Court comprehensively ruled out any {{use by the}} Member States of the retaliatory measures commonly permitted by general international law within the European Economic Community. That decision is often {{thought to be the}} best example of the European legal order's divergence with ordinary international law. Commission v Luxembourg & Belgium also has a logical connection with the nearly contemporaneous Van Gend en Loos and Costa v ENEL decisions, as arguably it is the doctrines of direct effect and supremacy that allow the European legal system to forego any use of <b>retaliatory</b> enforcement <b>mechanisms</b> by the Member States.|$|R
40|$|Exploring {{the factors}} {{governing}} the maintenance and breakdown {{of cooperation between}} mutualists is an intriguing and enduring problem for evolutionary ecology, and symbioses between ants and plants can provide useful experimental models for such studies. Hundreds of tropical plant species have evolved structures to house and feed ants, and these ant^plant symbioses have long been considered classic exam-ples of mutualism. Here, we report that the primary ant symbiont, Allomerus cf. demerarae, of the most abundant ant-plant found in south-east Peru, Cordia nodosa Lam., castrates its host plant. Allomerus workers protect new leaves and their associated domatia from herbivory, but destroy £owers, reducing fruit production to zero in most host plants. Castrated plants occupied by Allomerus provide more domatia for their associated ants than plants occupied by three species of Azteca ants that do not castrate their hosts. Allomerus colonies in larger plants have higher fecundity. As a consequence, Allomerus appears to bene¢t from its castration behaviour, {{to the detriment of}} C. nodosa. The C. nodosa^ant system exhibits none of the <b>retaliatory</b> or ¢ltering <b>mechanisms</b> shown to stabilize cheating in other cooperative systems, and appears to persist because some of the plants, albeit a small minority, are inhabited by the three species of truly mutualistic Azteca ants...|$|R
