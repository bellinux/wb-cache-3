In a simple economy with full regard of the materials flow it also explores the consequences for allocative efficiency and efficiency-restoring taxation of multiple and interdependent residuals generated in the transformation processes of production, abatement and consumption.

40|$|Much of the {{theoretical}} literature on environmental instrument reflects a normative presumption that only 2 ̆ 2 economic 2 ̆ 2 instruments, such as effluent taxes or tradable quotas, can produce an efficient outcome. Other potential alternatives, such as non-tradable quotas or more general Pigovian taxes are ruled out as inherently inefficient. Moreover, most of the literature relies on an important but unwarranted presumption: that cost and benefit functions, although they {{may be subject to}} uncertainty, are identical regardless of the regime that is chosen; that is price and quota systems are assumed to face the same cost and benefit curves with the same expected values. More crucially, the models assume that no regime will be subject to greater or lesser uncertainty than another. Under these assumptions, environmental instrument choice is determined simply by the relative elasticities of the curves. The real world is far more complicated than existing models of environmental instrument choice suggest. For one thing, monitoring and enforcement costs may be quite different for one regime than another. These cost differentials may affect not only comparisons between effluent tax and tradable permit schemes, but comparisons between 2 ̆ 2 economic 2 ̆ 2 instruments generally and more traditional regulatory instruments, such as technology-based standards or general Pigovian taxes. In some cases, for technological or institutional reasons, economic instruments will not efficiently or effectively attain exogenously set pollution-reduction goals. This paper offers a broader framework for comparing environmental instruments. Whereas most theoretical models focus exclusively on the comparative compliance/abatement costs of alternative regulatory instruments, this paper incorporates administrative costs and <b>residual</b> <b>pollution</b> costs into what we term a 2 ̆ 2 total-cost 2 ̆ 2 approach. The implications of this approach for environmental policy are then discussed in the context of efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.

40|$|International audienceHigher {{plants are}} exposed to natural {{environmental}} organic chemicals, associated with plant-environment interactions, and xenobiotic environmental organic chemicals, associated with anthropogenic activities. The effects of these chemicals result not only from interaction with metabolic targets, but also from interaction with the complex regulatory networks of hormone signaling. Purpose-designed plant hormone analogues thus show extensive signaling effects on gene regulation and are as such important for understanding plant hormone mechanisms and for manipulating plant growth and development. Some natural environmental chemicals also act on plants through interference with the perception and transduction of endogenous hormone signals. In a number of cases, bioactive xenobiotics, including herbicides that {{have been designed to}} affect specific metabolic targets, show extensive gene regulation effects, which are more in accordance with signaling effects than with consequences of metabolic effects. Some of these effects could be due to structural analogies with plant hormones or to interference with hormone metabolism, thus resulting in situations of hormone disruption similar to animal cell endocrine disruption by xenobiotics. These hormone-disrupting effects can be superimposed on parallel metabolic effects, thus indicating that toxicological characterisation of xenobiotics must take into consideration the whole range of signaling and metabolic effects. Hormone-disruptive signaling effects probably predominate when xenobiotic concentrations are low, as occurs in situations of <b>residual</b> low-level <b>pollutions.</b> These hormone-disruptive effects in plants may thus be of importance for understanding cryptic effects of low-dosage xenobiotics, as well as the interactive effects of mixtures of xenobiotic pollutants...|$|R

40|$|An engineering-economic {{model is}} used within a dynamic setting to {{determine}} the least cost mix of investment and import activities as the U. S. steel industry faces successively tighter controls on coke oven emissions over the next 10 years. In response to Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards proposed for 1995, U.

About 4 million tons of coke oven capacity is retrofit and about 1 million tons of annual coke consumption is replaced by new iron technologies, such as Corex. The Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) standards proposed for 1998 roughly double the coke oven retirements estimated to occur under MACT. Coke imports also are substantial but are no higher than under MACT because the additional time allows the industry to invest in more coke-saving blast furnaces and in new less toxic coke-making technologies, such as the Jewell process. The LAER standards in conjunction with higher capital costs, however, force coke imports to more than 8 million tons per year and sharply increase imports of semi-finished steel.

By developing a modified ethnographic approach suitable for Kuwait, I was able to collect and procure qualitative and quantitative data in a site-specific, systematic manner. From the cancer registry data, we notice a significant shift in breast cancer rates which began around 1999, increases 7 - 10 additional cases/ 100, 000, and continues until present. Leukemia and thyroid cancers are also increasing more rapidly than in other Arab countries not affected by the war. From the clinical case-control study, we identified an association between stress {{and the appearance of}} breast cancer in Kuwaiti women.

In this context, mitigation of air pollution due to thermal power plant emissions assumes special significance. The Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) - Asia's largest Lignite based Thermal Power Plant took a visionary step in this regard, four decades ago, via a massive afforestation program involving 17 million evergreen trees. These trees, now fully grown, {{play an important role}} in abating air pollution in the NLC town ship which is home to 128, 133 people. This first study quantifies the cleansing action of these evergreens by employing a tailor-made atmospheric dispersion-deposition model which accounts for unique regional factors- the year round high solar insolation, high temperatures and the convective nature of the atmospheric boundary layer. We model the dispersion of SO 2 emitted from multiple elevated stacks (typical source strengths are 300 g/s) and its deposition onto the evergreen canopy. Deposition is quantified in terms of the universal deposition velocity parameterization via inferential-resistance modelling of the transport pathways. Results indicate that considerable amount of pollution is deposited onto the canopy year round. In addition active cleansing of the atmosphere takes place over regions not directly in the path of SO 2 emissions but nevertheless affected by <b>residual</b> <b>pollution.</b> This is relevant to large areas of NLC due to the wind pattern which involves a daily wind direction shift in the afternoon as well as several periods of calm.

When the RML reached the site, the highest {{concentrations of}} CO, O 3 and aerosol particles were from the east, decreasing as the flow shifted to the southeast then to the southwest. The maximum concentration of condensation nuclei (CN) was greater than 25 &times; 10 &minus; 3 when winds were from the east. The highest mass concentrations of organic matter (OM), sulfate (SO 4 &minus;), and Nitrate (NO 3 + were 80, 4 and 8 μg m&minus; 3 , at standard temperature and pressure in air from the east. The mass concentration of OM in the RML was greater than 70 % of the total mass, regardless of the air mass origin. This compares to less than the 60 % that has been reported for Mexico City. At night, the mass fraction of sulfate went up by a factor of ten from the daytime value when air arrived from the east. The relationship between the CO and OM suggests {{that the majority of the}} daytime OM is from biomass burning and at night it is from wood burning. Whereas the maximum CO at Altzomoni, 0. 35 ppm, was approximately one tenth of the CO measured at the same time in the center of Mexico City, the maximum O 3 of 120 ppb was approximately the same as in the city. The maximum nighttime values of O 3 was 60 ppb, indicating the presence of <b>residual</b> <b>pollution.</b> From these results we conclude that even though Mexico City is the second most populated city in the world, with an associated high level of pollution, there are other significant sources of pollution in Mexico that contribute to the mixture of emissions that are dispersed throughout the region. This mixture rapidly erases the signature of a unique Mexico City "plume" and suggests that the environmental impact of this region should be considered as one that stems from a large area source rather than a single megacity...|$|E
40|$|Le Québec a consacré des efforts {{techniques}} et financiers substantiels à l'assainissement des eaux usées municipales et à l'entreposage des déjections animales afin de satisfaire les demandes des citoyens en matière de restauration des usages des cours d'eau. L'assainissement de l'eau a, dans l'ensemble, par ses choix technologiques et administratifs, engendré des investissements publics dépassant 7, 2 milliards de dollars et plus de 400 millions de dollars annuellement au chapitre de l'exploitation. Ces choix ont-ils permis d'atteindre un niveau de qualité de l'eau correspondant à un optimum social? À l'aide d'une étude de cas portant sur le bassin versant de la rivière Chaudière (Québec, Canada), cet article met en évidence les facteurs qui ont nuit à l'efficacité des politiques de contrôle de la pollution de l'eau au Québec. Sur ce bassin, 125 M$ ont été consacrés entre 1981 et 1992 à l'érection d'usines d'épuration utilisant différents types de traitement, 8, 6 M$ ont été alloués pour la construction de structures d'entreposage de fumiers et le service de la dette pour l'assainissement des eaux usées municipales atteindrait près de 527 M$ selon une hypothèse de financement de 25 ans. La performance des usines d'épuration a permis de réduire significativement les apports au cours d'eau, notamment en DBO 5 et en phosphore. Enfin, cette performance et le coût total de l'assainissement municipal sur le bassin de la Rivière Chaudière permettent d'évaluer, sur la base d'une relation coût-efficacité, qu'il y aurait un niveau optimal de qualité de l'eau pouvant résulté de l'établissement d'infrastructures d'assainissement des eaux usées municipales. Ainsi, dans l'optique d'une prise {{en charge}} sociale du problème collectif de la pollution de l'eau sur la base du bassin versant, il serait approprié que les gestionnaires et les usagers-contribuables de la ressource-eau, prennent en compte, non pas uniquement les objectifs de rejets, mais également les coûts et les performances de l'ensemble des usines d'épuration sur le bassin afin de retirer le maximum de charges polluantes là où les équipements sont les plus performants. Considerable technical and financial {{effort has been}} invested by Québec in the cleaning up of municipal wastewaters and storage of animal manure to meet demands by citizens to restore the province's rivers to their former state. Water pollution control has required technological and management choices that have resulted overall in public investments in excess of $ 7. 2 billion, with over $ 400 million going to operation costs annually. Have these choices enabled Québec to attain a water quality level consistent with a social optimum?Based on a case study taken from the Chaudière river watershed, Québec, Canada, this article posits two conditions for achieving a social optimum and underscores the factors that have offset the efficiency of water pollution control policies in Québec. According to the data collected on this watershed, between 1981 and 1992, $ 125 M was invested {{in the construction of}} sewage water treatment plants using various treatment methods, while $ 8. 6 M went towards manure storage facilities. On the whole, $ 527 M is expected to be spent over 25 years to service the debt for municipal wastewater treatment within the watershed. While inputs of pollutants, especially BOD 5 and phosphorus, have dropped significantly with the construction of the wastewater treatment plants, levels of <b>residual</b> <b>pollution</b> in the watershed remain high. It is suspected that total residual loads of phosphorus from municipal and agricultural sources are still well above the loads eliminated through wastewater treatment. If they are to achieve an efficient watershed-based approach to water management, decision-makers are faced with two conditions: the first addresses intersectoral efficiency in controlling pollution in a watershed and the second involves minimizing intrasectoral costs of pollution control. The condition explains the administrative and technical choices made as well as the importance of the political market in allocating resources to water pollution control among the socioeconomic sectors responsible for water quality deterioration. The condition explains how to minimize the costs in a specific socioeconomic sector among the available water treatment solutions. Using performance data from wastewater treatment plants and the total cost of wastewater treatment in the Chaudière river watershed, it can be assumed, based on a cost efficiency ratio, that an optimal level of water quality should occur {{as a result of the}} establishment of municipal wastewater treatment infrastructures. However, it would appear from the results obtained that Québec's water treatment program has deviated from a social optimum, i. e., restoration costs have not been shared equitably among users/polluters within the watershed, and measures to ensure maximum removal of pollution at minimum cost have not been secured. The play of political forces is central to the allocation of resources among pollution sources. Without a proper hard core concept, a water pollution control policy will not be able to elaborate the best solutions oriented towards attaining a social optimum. In the context of the high <b>residual</b> <b>pollution</b> loads within the watershed, there remains the issue of what water quality level is desirable at what cost, particularly with respect to the community's contribution to date and the efficiency of the response strategies that have been implemented. Now that wastewater treatment infrastructures have been set up, and a watershed-based approach to water management becomes effective, water resource managers and users/taxpayers should turn their attention away from discharge objectives only to focus also on the costs and performance of the watershed's treatment plants as a whole, so that removal of pollutant loads at high-performance facilities may be maximized...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{attenuation}} processes valorization for PAH-contaminated {{soil remediation}} has gained increasing interest from site owners. Indeed, {{far from the}} “do nothing; Nature will take rid of the problem” image, monitored natural attenuation (MNA) offers a valuable, cheaper and environmentally friendly alternative to more classical options such as physicochemical treatments (e. g. chemical oxidation, thermal desorption). The still refractory attitude of regulatory authorities and stakeholders mainly comes from both the lack of studies to really assess the efficiency and threats of this practice but also from its apparent absence of cost for polluters that could seem immoral and against public expectations. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) {{are among the most}} commonly found pollutants. Due to their high hydrophobicity and hence affinity for soil organic matter, there are persistent and they might be released in the environment through numerous ways: natural (e. g. forest fires) or artificial (e. g. fossil fuel combustion), everyday activities (e. g. traffic, household heating) or industrial production (e. g. coking plants, manufactured gas, refineries). For wide areas contaminated with moderately high concentrations and presenting no immediate threat for populations and the environment, MNA may proved a very relevant treatment solution. The present work proposes a long-term in situ evaluation of natural attenuation for management of PAH contaminated soils from different former industrial sites (coking industry, manufactured gas plants). An impact diagnosis was performed on sixty off ground plots that were left to natural attenuation for more than ten years. That included, leaching water analysis, total PAH concentrations, vegetation cover quality and quantity. Data were analyzed using principle component analysis (PCA) with R software and including main soil properties, initial management practices (e. g. fertilizer, liming) and final measurements. Results showed that in average PAH concentrations were reduced by 45 %, which is a rather good result, and that final PAH concentrations were related to particular size (silt fraction) and cation exchange capacity, suggesting that the structure and reactivity of the soil (respectively explaining accessibility and availability of PAH) might influence biodegradation processes. However, these results were also influenced by initial PAH concentration. PAH dissipation rate, which might be more interesting to assess the efficiency of natural attenuation as a treatment, was correlated to dissolved PAH and dissolved organic carbon in leached waters. Initial PAH concentration and initial pH seemed also important in explaining dissipation rates. In particular, liming seemed highly beneficial for degradation. PAH concentrations in leached water remained small, illustrating the relative stability of the residual contamination and minimal risk of transfer. All experimental plants displayed 100 % plant cover with no significant effect of <b>residual</b> <b>pollution</b> on plant diversity. These encouraging results are first elements that could promote natural attenuation to stakeholders for contaminated land management and illustrate the importance for long-term studies...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} {{of a collection of}} work on urban, brownfield and heavy metal contaminated soils carried out within the North West of England from March 2007 to December 2009. Field and laboratory based experiments were used to determine the amount of carbon stored in urban soils and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon and soil respiration. The effects of added organic amendments on carbon storage and mobility as well as the onward implications to heavy metals and arsenic mobility and the impact of earthworms on these processes were also investigated. A city-wide topsoil survey of parkland and road verges in Liverpool showed that carbon storage ranged from 10 kg total organic carbon m- 2 whilst physico-chemical characteristics and heavy metal and arsenic concentrations also varied considerably. The abundance oftechnogenic material restricted organic carbon storage and flux to the upper 30 cm of an inner city lawn soil studied in greater detail. Brownfield soil carbon storage and fluxes were enhanced by adding a small amount of green waste compost to these soils but large applications did not greatly increase carbon storage further. Enhanced losses of carbon by dissolved organic carbon leaching and increased soil respiration rates were consequences of greenwaste compost additions, although these effects were highly seasonal, occurring in greatest magnitude at the warmest periods of the year. Proportionately, the annual losses of carbon to soil respiration were far greater than those to dissolved organic carbon. An amendment consisting predominantly of woody material and a biochar amendment had a lower impact than composted greenwaste on dissolved organic carbon mobility, and the co-mobilisation of heavy metals and arsenic in a soil from a previously heavily industrialised centre of population. Earthworms reduced dissolved organic carbon when inoculated with compost and biochar amended soil, but increased this soluble fraction of carbon in woody amended soils, with attendant consequence to trace metal and arsenic mobility. Zinc and cadmium mobility were largely independent of changes in soluble carbon, but arsenic, copper and lead were heavily influenced by added carbon. Biochar amendment proved very effective in reducing concentrations of soluble cadmium and zinc in a heavy metal contaminated soil by adsorption, as well as having the added benefit of reducing total and bioavailable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations. It is concluded that carbon storage in urban soils can potentially be increased by applying organic amendments, although longer-term carbon storage may only be substantially enhanced with repeated applications of amendments. However, in urban soils with significant <b>residual</b> <b>pollution,</b> it can be questioned whether this practice is environmentally sound, regarding mobilisation of potentially harmful trace elements. Biochar and larger woody fraction amendments to soils may be more efficacious...|$|E
