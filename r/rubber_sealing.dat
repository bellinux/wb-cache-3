25|$|The {{production}} process start with mother rolls. First, the etched, roughened and pre-formed anode foil {{on the mother}} roll {{as well as the}} spacer paper and the cathode foil are cut to the required width. The foils are fed to an automatic winder, which makes a wound section in a consecutive operation involving three sequential steps: terminal welding, winding, and length cutting. In the next production step the wound section fixed at the lead out terminals is soaked with electrolyte under vacuum impregnation. The impregnated winding is then built into an aluminum case, provided with a <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> disc, and mechanically tightly sealed by curling. Thereafter, the capacitor is provided with an insulating shrink sleeve film. This optically ready capacitor is then contacted at rated voltage in a high temperature post-forming device for healing all the dielectric defects resulting from the cutting and winding procedure. After post-forming, a 100% final measurement of capacitance, leakage current, and impedance takes place. Taping closes the manufacturing process; the capacitors are ready for delivery.|$|E

The cabin was not like the fully pressurised cabin of a modern airliner; the pressure differential provided by the modified cockpit of the VI was only two {{pounds per square inch}} (which was double the Air Ministry requirement). To achieve this, the forward and rear cockpit bulkheads were completely enclosed, with all control and electrical cables exiting though special <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> grommets. In addition, the side cockpit door was replaced with alloy skin and the canopy was no longer a sliding unit: externally there were no slide rails.

Two types of o-ring <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> were used which are VITON and NBR. These <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> were fully immersed in {{two different types of}} oil, Seri Murni Palm Olein and Pennzoil 68 Hydraulic Oil for two months. Detailed analysis of the <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> mass, thickness and perimeter, swelling test, SEM and oxidation test were done during the period in order to investigate the dimensional and structural changes of <b>rubber</b> <b>seals.</b> The viscosities of immersed oil were also tested to analyze its impact and influence on the physical changes of seals. The analysis was done using the ASTM standard method. Result shows that the Seri Murni Palm Olein {{has the potential to be}} used as hydraulic fluid especially when using with VITON seal.

50|$|In {{common with}} tanks of this period, but in {{contrast}} to crawler tractors, the suspension had considerable articulation and permitted high speeds. The Vigor was capable of nearly 10 mph, when the comparable Caterpillar D8 could only reach 5 mph. The four roadwheels were linked as two bogies on each side. Pairs of bogies on opposite side were linked by an articulated beam with a centre tilt pivot. This suspension required a flexible track and Vickers developed one with <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> washers between the moving parts. This could be a drawback, as wear to the rubber in service could make the track floppy. Together with the great suspension articulation, if not well-maintained, the Vigor could be prone to throwing tracks when run at speed.|$|E

50|$|The {{plates are}} often spaced by <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> gaskets which are {{cemented}} into a section {{around the edge}} of the plates. The plates are pressed to form troughs at right angles to the direction of flow of the liquid which runs through the channels in the heat exchanger. These troughs are arranged so that they interlink with the other plates which forms the channel with gaps of 1.3 - 1.5 mm between the plates. The plates are compressed together in a rigid frame to form an arrangement of parallel flow channels with alternating hot and cold fluids. The plates produce an extremely large surface area, which allows for the fastest possible transfer. Making each chamber thin ensures that the majority of the volume of the liquid contacts the plate, again aiding exchange. The troughs also create and maintain a turbulent flow in the liquid to maximize heat transfer in the exchanger. A high degree of turbulence can be obtained at low flow rates and high heat transfer coefficient can then be achieved.|$|E
5000|$|In the 48th show on 3 September 1988, {{an editor}} of the German satirical {{magazine}} Titanic, Bernd Fritz, snuck into the show as a contestant under the pseudonym Thomas Rautenberg. The real Thomas Rautenberg, a graphic artist from Munich, offered his bet to Wetten, dass..?, to see how the ZDF would react. He claimed to recognize the colour of pencils by tasting them. Bernd Fritz took the bet to the show and won the bet. However he admitted he was cheating and the solution of how he did it could be read in the next issue of Titanic. Gottschalk then told the audience that he would read the magazine, and tell the trick in the next show, so that the magazine wouldn't get the publicity from this stunt. It was later explained that the blacked ski goggles that contestants wear if they need their vision removed for the bet, were adjusted by Fritz so he could peek through a gap along his nose to see the colour of the pencil. The showmaster tested the visibility through the goggles by faking punches against Fritz eyes and seeing if he would try to dodge them, but after the test it seemed as if Fritz adjusted the goggles to a more comfortable position before he attempted the bet. Since then, swimming goggles with a <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> that sticks to the skin have been used.|$|E

40|$|Part 5 : Aeronautical and Automotive EngineeringInternational audienceThis paper reviews a {{countermeasure}} {{development of}} leakage from coolant seals of head-gaskets in a diesel engine applying the Decomposition Analysis and Resolution Process (DAR). We can find complexity arising from some causes of leakage {{even in a}} simple square-ring <b>rubber</b> <b>seal.</b> The major causes are (1) large displacement around a head-gasket generated by the combustion, (2) seal distortion at a high compression, (3) <b>seal</b> <b>rubber</b> degradation induced by coolant microorganism deterioration, (4) uncontrolled seal production and (5) unsuitable rubber composition. Through our DAR, we can resolve {{the complexity of the}} leakage and can clarify all the cause positions and their relationships. We can confirm that an improved silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>seal,</b> which has a higher fatigue strength, an excellent acid-resistance and a uniform contact property, is the correct resolution.

40|$|The {{preoperative}} opacification of acrylic {{intraocular lenses}} (IOLs) {{was investigated in}} order to determine its cause. Opacified IOLs were examined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), the buffer solutions were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and the <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> used in the bottles in which the IOLs were stored were ashed and tested. The deposit covering the opacified lenses contained a significant amount of zinc, which was absent from fresh IOLs and buffer solution. The source of this was found to be the <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> used to seal the glass bottles in which the IOLs were stored. There were two types of <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> used, red and grey in colour. The buffer solutions in which opacification had occurred was also contaminated with zinc, but this was only noticeable when using the red seals. This contamination was reproduced by boiling red seals in fresh buffer solution for eighty minutes, to simulate autoclaving. It was concluded that zinc from the zinc oxide used as filler in the <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> was leaching into the buffer solution and causing the IOLs to become opacified. This was found to be much worse {{in the case of the}} red seals than for the grey ones. However, minute crystals were found on the IOLs stored using the grey ones, which could potentially act as nucleation points for postoperative opacification...|$|R

50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} on the ICF bogies. These bearings are press fitted on the axle journal by heating the bearings at a temperature of 80 to 100 °C in an induction furnace. Before fitting the roller bearing, an axle collar is press fitted. The collar ensures that the bearing does not move towards {{the center of the}} axle. After pressing the collar, a rear cover for the axle box is fitted. The rear cover has two main grooves. In one of the grooves, a nitrile <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> ring is placed. The sealing ring ensures that the grease in the axle box housing does not seep out during the running of the wheels. A woolen felt ring is placed in another groove. After the rear cover, a retaining ring is placed. The retaining ring is made of steel and is a press fit. The retaining ring ensures that the rear cover assembly is secured tightly between the axle collar and the retaining ring and stays at one place. The roller bearing is pressed after the retraining ring. Earlier, the collar and the bearings were heated in an oil bath. But now the practices has been discontinued and an induction furnace is used to heat them before fitting on the axle. The axle box housing, which is a steel casting, is then placed on the axle. The bearing is housed in the axle box housing. Axle box grease is filled in the axle box housing. Each axle box housing is filled with approximately 2.5 kg. of grease. The front cover for the axle box is placed on a housing which closes the axle box. The front cover is bolted by using torque wrench.|$|E

In order to study the important degree of every key environmental factor in downhole influencing the sealing performance of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> material, a new device of simulating downhole environment is designed to test the permeability of O-ring. The sample is hydrogenated nitrile O-ring and orthogonal experiment method is used to do nine tests by getting three levels from temperature, pressure and CO 2 volume fraction. Test adopts fuzzy orthogonal method to analyze the main effects and the interaction between two factors, taking tensile strength, diameter variety rate and pH value of indicator as evaluation index. The results show that: the environmental factor influencing the sealing performance of hydrogenated nitrile O-ring from high to low by turns is temperature, pressure and CO 2 volume fraction, while the interaction between temperature and pressure is the most significant. It provides a new way to study the influence of downhole complex environment on the performance of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> material.
