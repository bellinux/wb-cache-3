5000|$|Reverse {{logistics}} is {{the process}} of managing the return of goods. It is also referred to as [...] "aftermarket customer services". Any time money is taken from a company's warranty reserve or service logistics budget, one can speak of a reverse logistics operation.Reverse logistics is also the process of managing the return of goods from store, which the <b>returned</b> <b>goods</b> are sent back to warehouse and after that either warehouse scrap the goods or send them back to supplier for replacement depending on the warranty of the merchandise.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{orders are}} [...] "special orders", covered by Section 133 of the Act. There are two types; return orders and {{transfer}} orders. Return orders are {{orders from the}} court requiring the return of goods covered by the agreement to the creditor. These orders may be immediate or subject to a delay, and may give the debtor the option to pay the goods value to the creditor {{if he does not}} return the goods in time. Transfer orders are orders transferring the creditor's ownership of certain goods to the debtor, ordering the payment {{of the rest of the}} goods to the creditor. This can only be done if the debtor pays an amount of money equal or more than one third of the value of the <b>returned</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{documents}} used in logistics. They are called: invoices, packing lists/slips/sheets (manifests), content lists, pick tickets, arrival acknowledgement forms/reports of many types (e.g. MSDS, damaged goods, <b>returned</b> <b>goods,</b> detailed/summary, etc.), import/export, delivery, {{bill of lading}} (BOL), etc. These documents are usually the contracts between the consignee and the consignor, so they are very important for both parties and any intermediary, like a third party logistics company (3PL) and governments. Document handling within logistics, supply chain management and distribution centers is usually performed manual labor or semi-automatically using bar code scanners, software and tabletop laser printers. There are some manufacturers of high speed document automation systems that will automatically compare the laser printed document to the order and either insert or automatically apply an enclosed wallet/pouch to the shipping container (usually a flexible polybag or corrugated fiberboard/rigid container). See below for external website video links showing these document automation systems. Protection of Privacy and Identity Theft are major concerns, especially {{with the increase of}} e-Commerce, Internet/Online shopping and Shopping channel (other, past references are catalogue and mail order shopping) making it more important than ever to guarantee the correct document is married or associated to the correct order or shipment every time. Software that produce documents are; ERP, WMS, TMS, legacy middleware and most accounting packages.|$|E

40|$|Recycling and {{remanufacturing}} <b>returned</b> <b>goods</b> are economically {{beneficial for}} companies since {{the cost of}} obtaining used parts is lower in many cases and selling price is close {{to that of a}} new product. This leads to decreased costs and thereby increased profits for the company. In addition, there are also great environmental benefits by keeping the structural integrity of a part; the energy used for disassembly and refurbishing is much lower than the energy required for raw material extraction and machining. Encompassing the <b>returned</b> <b>goods</b> makes the supply chain to closed loop supply chain, which is different from the traditional supply chain due to reverse logistics. A reverse flow of material is however usually more complex than a forward flow of parts and components from suppliers. This means that inventory management becomes critical and needs to be viewed from a new perspective. The purpose of the report is to study FAW Co., Ltd’s inventory situation in reverse logistics. The report analysed the inventory management in the company, specifically focusing on one product as the instance Motor Engine LFTS- 2000 since it is in the maturity stage of product life cycle. Two scenarios were designed to consider how different parameters affect inventory levels in reverse logistics. The report analysed how different parameters affect the inventory levels and minimum cost. With the increasing <b>returned</b> <b>goods</b> are processed, inventory levels and minimum cost will decrease correspondingly. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this master’s thesis are to investigate how lead times of the reverse logistical flow can be reduced and how work methods can be improved at a retailing distribution center. The investigated parts of the distribution center are processes, operations and internal flow related to handling of <b>returned</b> <b>goods.</b> Reverse logistical environments, associated to online and catalog retailing, are characterized by high uncertainties since large diversity of products arrives in small quantities. The project has been conducted {{by the use of}} a methods engineering approach. Several studies were made to collect and compile data in order to present a current state of the investigated area. Results from analyzing the current state showed exceptional long lead times, unstable processes and improvement potential in manual operations. From the results, together with the project’s frame of reference, a number of proposed improvements were presented. The improvements aim to reduce lead times in handling of <b>returned</b> <b>goods</b> by reducing buffer sizes, balancing flow of goods and re-planning the manning of workstations. Further, actions which will increase efficiency and simplify routines have also been presented. All suggested improvements contribute to an overall reduction of lead time, a stable flow and increased productivity in returns handling.

40|$|International audienceThe {{popularity}} of round-the-clock online shopping urges {{the rapid growth}} of e-commerce, which substantially generatesadditional parcels for the distribution on the forward side. On the other hand, collecting the <b>returned</b> <b>goods</b> on the revereside is also increasingly becoming a preoccupation, particularly in the crowd and dense metropolitan areas. Inspired by theconcepts of Crowdsourcing and Physical Internet,we propose an innovative solution to collect the e-commerce returned goodsfrom final consumption points back to retailers. As an alternative to traditional ways, this solution delivers the returned goodsand passengers in an integrated way by leveraging the extra loading capacity and constant mobility provided by taxis thatare already reserved to transport passengers. Thus, it could simultaneously migrate the negative economical, environmentaland social impacts of reverse flows management. To address the issue of the <b>returned</b> <b>goods</b> collection, we first conduct thequalitative and quantitative study, and further investigate the feasibility and viability of the solution based on three real-worlddatasets, which consist of locations of shops, a road network and a large-scale trajectory data generated by over 7000 taxisin a month in the city of Hangzhou, China. Three collection strategies are proposed and evaluated. Experimental resultsgenerate several useful insights into the implementability and managerial issues of the proposed solution...|$|E
40|$|Withdrawal rights protect {{buyers in}} {{distance}} selling, for example when ordering via the Internet. After introducing {{such a law}} in Germany the proportion of <b>returned</b> <b>goods</b> drastically increased although most sellers had already offered a return option before. We experimentally investigate scenarios in which sellers can voluntarily offer a withdrawal right. In a second treatment it is provided by law. We find indications that a voluntary provision is perceived as friendly, so that buyers reciprocate by not exploiting sellers too heavily. A third treatment reveals that small return costs for buyers have only a marginal influence on withdrawal behaviour. ...|$|E
