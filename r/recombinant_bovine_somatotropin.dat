The rbST has increased milk production in dairy animals, including cow, sheep and goats.

For dairy cows, the optimal dose of rbST treatment is between 25 and 50 mg/day. Daily injection of rbST may produce better response, but sustained-release formulations of rbST are more practical. The magnitude of milk production response to rbST range from 10 to 35 % in dairy cows. The rbST has no or little effects on the milk composition, processing properties and taste. The rbST did not affect digestion of feeds or the efficiency of utilizing absorbed nutrients for milk synthesis, and it has no or little effect on rumen fermentation, flow of nutrients to the small intestine and total tract digestibility, but it improves the feed efficiency in dairy cows. The rbST induced significant increase in serum bST. It has a galactopoietic effect, since it increase the metabolic activity of mammary cells or slow their involution, thereby allowing more secretory cells to persist over time and contribute to increasing milk synthesis and yield.

As direct detection of rbST in serum is problematic, methods based on the detection of changes in multiple rbST-dependent biomarkers have high potential for monitoring rbST abuse. In this study immunoassays were developed for total {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF- 1) in cow sera. Ultimately aiming at combination with other rbST-dependent biomarker assays two multiplex formats were studied and compared critically, a multi-channel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) -based biosensor and flow cytometry combined with color encoded microbeads. Moreover, a new dedicated sample pretreatment was developed for the dissociation of complexed IGF- 1 in serum, while keeping other biomarkers in solution. Compared to the SPR biosensor immunoassay, the flow cytometric immunoassay (FCIA) was more sensitive, less antibody-consuming and less vulnerable to necessary but interfering reagents from the sample treatment. In an initial in-house validation study the developed FCIA showed to be fast, specific, robust, and a high repeatability and reliability, and generated realistic IGF- 1 values for bovine serum, without compromising the potential for simultaneous detection of other biomarkers. Due to the xMAP technology, in which 100 different bead sets can be measured simultaneously, the total IGF- 1 assay can easily be extended with other immunoassays for candidate biomarkers.

5000|$|Bovine {{somatotropin}} or bovine somatotrophin (abbreviated bST and BST), or bovine {{growth hormone}} (BGH), is a peptide hormone produced by cows' pituitary glands. Like other hormones, it is produced in small quantities and is used in regulating metabolic processes. After the biotech company Genentech discovered and patented the gene for BST in the 1970s, it became possible to synthesize the hormone using recombinant DNA technology to create <b>recombinant</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>somatotropin</b> (rBST), recombinant {{bovine growth hormone}} (rBGH), or artificial growth hormone. Four large pharmaceutical companies, Monsanto, American Cyanamid, Eli Lilly, and Upjohn, developed commercial rBST products and submitted them to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval. Monsanto was the first firm to receive approval. Other countries (Mexico, Brazil, India, Russia, and at least ten others) also approved rBST for commercial use. Monsanto licensed Genentech's patent, and marketed their product as [...] "Posilac".

However, its use is prohibited in most of Europe for reasons of consumer preference, animal well-being, and skepticism of new technology. For farmers who opt to use the synthetic hormone, it plays {{a vital role in}} milk production. However, concerns of both product safety and livestock abuse have prompted discussions for new methods in assaying the levels of dairy cattle rBST. One proposed method involves quantifying {{the presence or absence of}} the rBST-binding antibody in serum. However, this method would require blood samples to be taken regularly and is thus considered by some critics to be too invasive. The development of other alternative methods continue to undergo development. One such example, tested by W.W. Thatcher at the University of Florida, involves collecting milk samples from the cows and analyzing them directly for the presence of the rBST antibody. Dairy cattle do respond to the rBST angtigen and have shown positive results in immunosorbent trials on milk samples. Tests involving pasteurized milk samples have even shown consistent results, with immunoglobulin rBST still detectable and distinguishable despite other antibodies remaining present. Research on the viability of this new technique, as well as many others, as a means of monitoring the levels of rBST in dairy cattle continues to be an issue of practicality, profitability, and humaneness towards livestock in the dairy industry.|$|E
