As this potential breaks parity and generalized parity, we find a non-vanishing average current.

40|$|Spike sorting {{refers to}} the {{detection}} and classification of electric potentials (spikes) from multi-neuron recordings, a difficult but essential pre-processing step before neural data can be analyzed for information content. While several spike sorting algorithms have been proposed, {{our goal is to}} determine the ultimate limits of spike classification and to characterize this error, regardless of spike sorting algorithm. We account for the major factors influencing the sorting procedure: SNR, <b>relative</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>ratio</b> and inter-spike correlation in time and waveform morphology. Using an ideal detection/estimation system we calculate detection probabilities and time delay estimation errors as they vary with these parameters, establishing upper bounds on spike classification in terms of these metrics.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{acoustic}} phonon response of crystals hosting a gapped time-reversal symmetry breaking electronic state. The phonon effective action can in general acquire a dissipationless "Hall" viscosity, which {{is determined by}} the adiabatic Berry curvature of the electron wave function. This Hall viscosity endows the system with a characteristic frequency, ω_v; for acoustic phonons of frequency ω, it shifts the phonon spectrum by an amount of order (ω/ω_v) ^ 2 and it mixes the longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonons with a <b>relative</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>ratio</b> of ω/ω_v and with a phase shift of +/- π/ 2, to lowest order in ω/ω_v. We study several examples, including the integer quantum Hall states, the quantum anomalous Hall state in Hg_ 1 -yMn_yTe quantum wells, and a mean-field model for p_x + i p_y superconductors. We discuss situations in which the acoustic phonon response {{is directly related to the}} gravitational response, for which striking predictions have been made. When the electron-phonon system is viewed as a whole, this provides an example where measurements of Goldstone modes may serve as a probe of adiabatic curvature of the wave function of the gapped sector of a system.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} and gain better understanding of a new modeling technique called modeling by demigration. Demigration itself {{can be defined as}} the inverse of true amplitude migration. This involves nothing more than the formulation of a reflection imaging process by which one can return from a true amplitude depth migrated section to the original common offset section. Modeling by demigration represents a special implementation of the demigration concept, where the input is no longer standard migrated data but artificially migrated target geological structure(s) defined by the user. In this thesis the artificially migrated inputs are computed by employing both a standard/classical approach and the PSDM simulator approach of NORSAR (SimPLI technology). A feasibility study has been carried out where the modeling by demigration concept has been compared with more standard modeling techniques based on dynamic ray tracing and Kirchhoff Helmholtz integral. Synthetic data were generated for three different geological structures; a syncline, an anticline, and a fault. The output from the various modeling methods were compared based on both visual inspection as well as quantitative measures of <b>relative</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>ratios.</b> In addition, the synthetic datasets were migrated to see how well the original geological structures could be mapped back. The conclusions from this study were as follows;  The dynamic ray tracing method performed poor in the case of complex geology, as expected,  Modeling by demigration proved to be a feasible concept when benchmarked with the standard Kirchhoff Helmholtz modeling technique,  However, work needs to be carried out with respect to calibrations before direct (absolute) amplitude comparisons can be made, and  The SimPLI approach can represent an alternative to the standard artificial migration proposed in the original version of modeling by demigration...|$|R

This study was carried out by a programme of experimental work combined with the development of a one-dimensional model.

It was found that the level of NO emissions became lower with increasing operating frequency and positive pressure amplitude.

40|$|Nickel {{passive film}} {{has been studied}} in acidic sulfate {{solutions}} at pH 2. 3 and 3. 3 by ellipsometry. During anodic passivation followed by cathodic reduction, the roughness increases with dissolution of nickel, being indicated by gradual decrease of reflectance. However, the ellipsometric parameters, Ψ (arctan of <b>relative</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>ratio)</b> and Δ (relative retardation of phase), are relatively insensitive to the roughness increase. From the change of Ψ and Δ, δΨ and δΔ, during the anodic passivation and reduction, thickness of the passive oxide film was estimated with assumption of refractive index of nf = 2. 3 of the film. The thickness estimated is a range between 1. 4 and 1. 7 nm in the passive potential region from 0. 8 to 1. 4 V vs. RHE, having a tendency of thickening with increase of potential. Cathodic reduction at constant potential induces a change of the oxide film to an oxide film with lower refractive index of nf = 1. 7, accompanied by thickening of the film about 30 % more in the initial stage of reduction for 30 s. The gradual decrease of thickness takes place for the oxide with the lower refractive index in the latter stage. The potential change from the passive region to cathodic hydrogen evolution region may initially cause hydration of the passive oxide of NiO, i. e., NiO + H 2 O = Ni(OH) 2, and during the latter stage of reduction, the hydrated nickel oxide gradually dissolves...|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} {{autocorrelation function}} of the intensity fluctuations of laser light scattered from motile bull spermatozoa is shown to depend upon several factors not previously considered.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{study the}} photoelectron angular distribution (PAD) from the two-photon single ionization of H and He by femtosecond and attosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses, {{based on the}} time-dependent perturbation theory and simulations with the full time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The PAD is formed by the interference of the s and d continuum wave packets, and, thus, contains {{the information on the}} <b>relative</b> phase and <b>amplitude</b> <b>ratio</b> between them. We find that, when a spectrally broadened femtosecond pulse is resonant with an excited level, the PAD substantially changes with pulse width, since the competition between resonant and nonresonant ionization paths, leading to distinct from the scattering phase shift difference, changes with it. In contrast, when the Rydberg manifold is excited, and for the case of above-threshold two-photon ionization, and the PAD do not depend much on pulse width, except for the attosecond region. Thus, the Rydberg manifold and the continuum behave similarly in this respect. For a high-harmonic pulse composed of multiple harmonic orders, while the value is different from that for a single-component pulse, the PAD still rapidly varies with pulse width. The present results illustrate a new way to tailor the continuum wave packet...|$|R

However, when we systematically changed strike, dip, and rake angles, the resultant maximum source <b>amplitude</b> <b>ratios</b> for the synthetic data were about 103, whereas the ratios in observed data are limited to the range 10 – 20. There are two plausible interpretations of this apparent inconsistency. One is that we happened to observe only events with focal mechanisms that produced source <b>amplitude</b> <b>ratios</b> within the range 10 – 20. Our synthetic {{tests showed that}} normalized frequencies decrease with increasing source <b>amplitude</b> <b>ratio</b> (Fig.  12), which indicates that very few events with mechanisms that produce larger source <b>amplitude</b> <b>ratios</b> were observed. The alternative interpretation is that distortion of radiation patterns in the long-period band reduces maximum source <b>amplitude</b> <b>ratios</b> and affects CMT estimates. Such distortion is known in high-frequency bands of around several hertz and has been explained by the path effect caused by scattering of seismic waves (e.g., Liu and Helmberger 1985; Takemura et al. 2009, 2015; Kumagai et al. 2010, 2011; Kobayashi et al. 2015). Because such scattering effects may not be dominant in the long-period band, wavefield distortion due to source finiteness and complexity and/or large-scale structures are possible causes. To validate these interpretations, we need further analysis of seismic waveform data and waveform simulations to be run for finite source rupture models in three-dimensional structures.|$|R
