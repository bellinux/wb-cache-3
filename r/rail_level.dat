During that period, he persuaded the Queen of Spain to back the {{construction}} of a railway in the backwoods of Pennsylvania; her support provided funding for the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad.

25|$|On {{the western}} side of the village is a viaduct on the disused Bristol and North Somerset Railway, built in 1873 but closed to trains in 1968 after the great flood of Pensford, after which it was deemed unsafe. The last {{passenger}} train had been earlier: the 9:25a.m. from Frome to Bristol on 31 October 1959; after that there were only goods trains (mainly bringing coal from Radstock), which ceased in 1964, and very occasional excursion trains. Pensford viaduct is 995 feet (303 m) long, reaches a maximum height of 95 feet (29 m) to <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> and consists of sixteen arches. The viaduct is now a Grade II listed building.|$|E

2500|$|In 1936 six {{lightweight}} Wairarapa railcars, RM 4-9, {{were introduced}} between Palmerston North, Masterton and Wellington. [...] They were {{specifically designed for}} the Incline, and were built at the Hutt Workshops. They were named after historic Maori canoes: Maahunui, Mahuhu, Mamari, Matahourua, Mataatua and Arai-te-Uru. [...] Initially powered by [...] Leyland petrol engines, they were upgraded after several years to [...] diesel engines. [...] They had a single rear driving axle with 38½" [...] (978 mm) diameter wheels, necessitated by {{the need for the}} axle and final drive unit to have sufficient clearance above the Incline’s centre rail. [...] Because of the large rear wheels the floor of the passenger compartment was 52½" [...] (1334 mm) above <b>rail</b> <b>level,</b> more than [...] higher than normal. [...] They were rated for a maximum speed of [...] and expected to climb the Incline at 15-17mph, but actually managed only 10–12mph. They were withdrawn in 1955 when the Incline closed.|$|E
2500|$|In north Somerset, around Radstock mining in the Somerset {{coalfield}} was {{an important}} industry, and {{in an effort to}} reduce the cost of transporting the coal the Somerset Coal Canal was built; part of it was later converted into a railway. It connected to the Kennet and Avon Canal which linked the River Thames at Reading and the Floating Harbour at Bristol, joining the River Avon at Bath via Bath Locks. The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway connected Bath and Bournemouth. It was jointly operated by the Midland Railway and the London and South Western Railway (L). [...] After the 1 January 1923 Grouping joint ownership of the S passed to the LMS and the Southern Railway. The area was also served by the Bristol and North Somerset Railway that connected Bristol with towns in the Somerset coalfield. The line was opened in 1873 between Bristol and Radstock, where it joined with an earlier freight only line from Frome. The biggest civil engineering project on the line was the Pensford Viaduct over the River Chew. The viaduct is 995 feet long, reaches a maximum height of 95 feet to <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> and consists of 16 arches. It is now a Grade II listed building. Freight services on the branch line ceased in 1951. The line achieved some fame after closure by its use in the film The Titfield Thunderbolt, but the track was taken up in 1958.|$|E

25|$|At railway stations, a {{pedestrian}} level crossing is sometimes provided to allow passengers to reach other platforms {{in the absence}} of an underpass or bridge, or for disabled access.

40|$|Surface {{roughness}} on 150 railway {{wheels and}} on the rails of 30 sites in the Netherlands have been measured. Block braked wheels were found to show higher roughnesses than the rail at any site. The smoothest rail is 8 dB smoother than the smoothest wheel. It was concluded that in reducing railway rolling noise NS must start {{to find ways to}} lower wheel roughness. Only after block brakes have been either removed or optimized will the rail require any attention. An exception to this rule is rail corrugation, which was found to occur locally. A good correlation was found between wheel and <b>rail</b> roughness <b>levels</b> and pass-by sound levels. Also, it was shown experimentally that wheel and <b>rail</b> roughness <b>levels</b> contribute with equal weight to noise production...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{versions}} {{were released}} for the Saturn: the Japanese release, {{which is similar}} to the PlayStation version, and the North American release, which is labeled as a [...] "Special Edition". The Special Edition features slightly enhanced visuals and some options which do not appear in other versions of the game, but its main feature is two exclusive <b>rail</b> shooter <b>levels</b> with polygon graphics. These levels appear in the place of the PC version's two <b>rail</b> shooter <b>levels,</b> but bear no resemblance to them. They have a number of glitches; for instance, level 3 sometimes fails to end when the boss is defeated. Presumably due to space limitations, the Special Edition splits the final level into two levels, one on each disc. Sound disappears at set intervals during cutscenes in both Saturn versions.|$|R

40|$|The {{influences}} of train speed and <b>rail</b> roughness <b>level</b> on rolling noise and subsurface initiated rolling contact fatigue (RCF) impact are studied. In particular, {{the consequences of}} short-pitch rail corrugation on tangent track with wavelengths in the interval 3 – 8 cm are simulated using models of dynamic vehicle–track interaction. Based on the calculated results, a criterion {{in terms of a}} limit for maximum <b>levels</b> of <b>rail</b> roughness can be determined. Such a criterion may be useful for planning of rail grinding intervals if used together with a system for regular monitoring of <b>rail</b> roughness <b>levels.</b> It is concluded that the importance of controlling rail roughness increases with increasing train speed. Increasing axle loads on freight vehicles from 22. 5 tonnes to 30 tonnes leads to a significant increase in RCF impact. In operational practice, this is usually compensated for by introducing more conformal wheel–rail profile combinations. Calculated vertical wheel–rail contact forces and rolling noise levels show good agreement with field measurement...|$|R
