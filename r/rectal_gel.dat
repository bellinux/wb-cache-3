40|$|Acute {{repetitive}} seizures, {{more commonly}} known as cluster, crescendo or sequential seizures, are defined as episodes of increased seizure activity occurring in patients with refractory epilepsy who are already receiving stable regimens of anticonvulsants. They lie in the seizure spectrum between isolated seizures and status epilepticus. If acute repetitive seizures are left untreated, they may progress to status epilepticus. Acute repetitive seizures and prolonged seizures are rated as a neurological emergency and treatment must be prompt. The primary goals of therapy are cessation of the seizure and prevention of recurrence. The use of traditional intravenous agents such as phenytoin, phenobarbital (phenobarbitone), lorazepam and diazepam is well established in the first-line treatment of acute seizures. However, adverse effects and the time to onset of effect often dictate the choice between older anticonvulsants. Newer agents (such as fosphenytoin) and alternative routes of administration (such as rectal administration of diazepam solution) have been developed {{in an effort to}} reduce adverse effects, decrease the time to onset of effect, reduce acute care facility costs and investigate the possibility of home treatment. Diazepam <b>rectal</b> <b>gel,</b> a newer formulation of diazepam intended for rectal administration, effectively terminates acute seizures and prevents recurrence within the first 12 hours after administration. Diazepam <b>rectal</b> <b>gel</b> is available for use by a trained caregiver in a home setting and, therefore, emergency room treatment and hospitalisation may not be required and could be avoided. This may result in reductions in financial and emotional costs associated with acute repetitive seizures, but broader clinical experience is needed to assess this. Diazepam <b>rectal</b> <b>gel</b> is not associated with respiratory depression and most adverse effects appear to be mild to moderate in severity. At present, diazepam <b>rectal</b> <b>gel</b> is a valuable addition to the current anticonvulsant armamentarium for first-line therapy of acute repetitive seizures. Wider clinical experience will better determine the place of this formulation in the treatment of this debilitating disorder.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Effective seizure {{management}} {{in the school setting}} is a critical issue for students with seizures, as well as their parents, classmates, and school personnel. The unpredictable nature of seizures and the potential outcomes of experiencing a seizure in school are sources of anxiety for students with seizures.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background Acute {{repetitive}} seizures {{are readily}} recognizable episodes involving increased seizure frequency. Urgent treatment is often required. <b>Rectal</b> diazepam <b>gel</b> is a promising therapy. Methods We conducted a randomized, doubleblind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study of home-based treatment for acute repetitive seizures. Patients {{were randomly assigned}} to receive either <b>rectal</b> diazepam <b>gel,</b> at doses ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 5 mg per kilogram of body weight on the basis of age, or placebo. Children received one dose at the onset of acute repetitive seizures and a second dose four hours later. Adults received three doses — one dose at onset, and two more doses 4 and 12 hours after onset. Treatment was administered by a care giver, such as a parent, who had received special training. The number of seizures after the first dose was counted for 12 hours in children and for 24 hours in adults. Results Of 125 study patients (64 assigned to diazepam and 61 to placebo) with a history of acute repetitive seizures, 91 (47 children and 44 adults) were treated for an exacerbation of seizures during the study period. Diazepam treatment was superior to placebo with regard to the outcome variables related to efficacy: reduced seizure frequency (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and improved global assessment of treatment outcome by the care giver (frequency and severity of seizures and drug toxicity) (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Post hoc analysis showed diazepam to be superior to placebo in reducing seizure frequency in both children (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and adults (P= 0. 02), but only in children was it superior with regard to improvement in global outcome (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). The time to the first recurrence of seizures after initial treatment was longer for the patients receiving diazepam (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Thirty-five patients reported at least one adverse effect of treatment; somnolence was the most frequent. Respiratory depression was not reported.

40|$|Aim: We {{assessed}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of three different local anesthesia methods (pudendal nerve blockade, tenoxicam suppository and <b>rectal</b> lidocaine <b>gel)</b> before transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) -guided biopsy of the prostate in this study. Materials and Methods: In our prospective and controlled study, 136 consecutive patients were randomized into four groups: men in group 1 (n= 41) received no anesthesia, group 2 (n= 30) received intrarectal 10 cc 2 % lidocaine gel 10 mins before biopsy, group 3 (n= 31) received 20 mg tenoxicam suppository 30 mins before biopsy and pudendal nerve blockade was performed in group 4 (n= 34) 10 mins before biopsy using 10 ml of 1 % lidocaine. The patients were asked to grade the pain when TRUS probe was inserted and during the biopsy procedure using a 11 -point linear visual analog scale (VAS) and their pain scores were noted. Results: There were statistically significant differences among four groups regarding the mean VAS scores during probe insertion (p= 0. 024) and biopsy (p= 0. 012). This significance {{was provided by the}} difference between the group 1 and 4 (p= 0. 015 for probe insertion and p= 0. 022 for biopsy with Tukey test). No statistically significant difference was found among the pain scores of group 1, 2 and, 3 during probe insertion and biopsy.

40|$|Abstract Background Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) {{is marked}} with chronic {{inflammation}} of intestinal epithelium driven by oxidative stress. Traditional treatments with plant extracts gained renewed interest {{due to their}} ability to ameliorate the multi factorial conditions like inflammation. We investigated the beneficial effects of Withania somnifera in Trinitro Benzyl Sulfonic Acid (TNBS) induced experimental IBD through a rectally applicable formulation. Methods The study included (i) preparation of gel formulation from aqueous Withania somnifera root extract (WSRE), (ii) biochemical assays to determine its performance potential, (iii) testing of formulation efficacy in TNBS-induced IBD rat model, and (iv) histo-patholgical studies to assess its healing and muco-regenerative effect in IBD-induced rats. For this purpose, concentration dependant antioxidant activity of the extracts were evaluated using biochemical assays like (a) inhibition of lipid peroxidation, (b) NO scavenging, (c) H 2 O 2 scavenging, and (d) ferric reducing power assay. Results The extract, at 500 μg/ml, the highest concentration tested, showed 95. 6 % inhibition of lipid peroxidation, 14. 8 % NO scavenging, 81. 79 % H 2 O 2 scavenging and a reducing capacity of 0. 80. The results were comparable with standard antioxidants, ascorbic acid and curcumin. WSRE treatment positively scored on histopathological parameters like necrosis, edema, neutrophil infiltration. The post treatment intestinal features showed restoration at par with the healthy intestine. In view of these results, gel formulation containing an aqueous extract of W. somnifera, prepared for rectal application was tested for its anti-inflammatory activity in TNBS-induced rat models for IBD. Commercially available anti-inflammatory drug Mesalamine was used as the standard in this assay.

Product use was assessed by mixed methods including unused product return count, text messaging reports, and qualitative plasma TFV pharmacokinetic (PK) results. Convergence interviews engaged participants in determining the most accurate number of doses used based on product count and text messaging reports. Client-centered adherence counseling was also used. Participants (N = 187) were {{men who have sex with}} men and transgender women enrolled in the United States (42 %), Thailand (29 %), Peru (19 %) and South Africa (10 %). Mean age was 31. 4 years (range 18 - 64 years). Based on convergence interviews, over an 8 -week period, 94 % of participants had ≥ 80 % adherence to daily tablet, 41 % having perfect adherence; 83 % had ≥ 80 % adherence to daily gel, 29 % having perfect adherence; and 93 % had ≥ 80 % adherence to twice-weekly use during the RAI-associated gel regimen, 75 % having perfect adherence and 77 % having ≥ 80 % adherence to gel use before and after RAI.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{measured}} and compared the pharmacokinetics of CMPD 167, a small molecule antiretroviral CCR 5 inhibitor with potential as an HIV microbicide, following vaginal, rectal and oral administration in rhesus macaques. Methods: Avaginal hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) <b>gel,</b> a <b>rectal</b> HEC <b>gel,</b> a silicone elastomer matrix-type vaginal ring and an oral solution, each containing CMPD 167, were prepared and administered to rhesus macaques pretreated with Depo-Provera. CMPD 167 concentrations in vaginal fluid, vaginal tissue (ring only), rectal fluid and blood plasma were quantified by HPLC-mass spectrometry. Results: CMPD 167 concentrations measured in rectal fluid, vaginal fluid and blood plasma were {{highly dependent on}} both the route of administration and the formulation type. Although rectal and vaginal fluid concentrations were highest when CMPD 167 was administered locally (via either gel or ring), lower concentrations of the drug were also measured in these compartments following administration at the remote mucosal site or orally. CMPD 167 levels in the vaginal and rectal fluid following oral administration were relatively low compared with local administration. Conclusions: The study provides clear evidence for vaginal-rectal and rectal-vaginal drug transfer pathways and suggests that oral pre-exposure prophylaxis with CMPD 167 may be less efficacious at preventing sexual transmission of HIV- 1 than topically applied products...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic {{constipation}} {{in children}} {{can be caused by}} cows' milk intolerance (CMI), but its pathogenesis is unknown. AIMS: To evaluate the histology and manometry pattern in patients with food intolerance-related constipation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive children with chronic constipation were enrolled. All underwent an elimination diet and successive double-blind food challenge. All underwent rectal biopsy and anorectal manometry. RESULTS: A total of 14 patients were found to be suffering from CMI and three from multiple food intolerance. They had a normal stool frequency on elimination diet, whereas constipation recurred on food challenge. The patients with food intolerance showed a significantly higher frequency of erosions of the mucosa, and the number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes and eosinophils. The <b>rectal</b> mucous <b>gel</b> layer showed that the food-intolerant patients had a significantly lower thickness of mucus than the other subjects studied. Manometry showed a higher anal sphincter resting pressure and a lower critical volume in food intolerance patients than in the others suffering from constipation unrelated to food intolerance.

A subset of participants from Stage 1 A were then enrolled in Stage 1 B, a 12 -week evaluation of the safety and acceptability of a placebo <b>rectal</b> <b>gel.</b> This was followed by the final phase of the study (Stage 2) in which a subset of participants from Stage 1 B were enrolled into a Phase 1 rectal safety and acceptability evaluation of tenofovir (TFV) 1 % gel. 248 participants were enrolled into Stage 1 A. Participants' average age was 23. 3 years. The most common sexually transmitted infection (STIs) at baseline were Herpes simplex (HSV) - 2 (16. 1 % by serology) and rectal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) (10. 1 % by NAAT). 134 participants were enrolled into Stage 1 B. During the 12 week period of follow-up 2 HIV, 5 rectal CT, and 5 rectal Neisseria gonorrhea infections were detected. The majority of adverse events (AEs) were infections (N = 56) or gastrointestinal (N = 46) and were mild (69. 6 %) or moderate (28. 0 %).

BRUNDAGE, PharmD. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 142 pages, appendix p. 140 - 142. The overall goal of my thesis projects was {{to characterize the}} pharmacokinetics, bioavailability and tolerability of CNS drugs used in the acute management of seizure emergencies and spasticity. Two drugs were studied: diazepam and baclofen. Both of these drugs are already approved by the FDA and have been extensively used. For diazepam, two novel formulations were evaluated for intranasal delivery as rescue therapy in seizure emergencies. In the case of baclofen, commercially available intrathecal baclofen solution was administered intravenously to characterize its pharmacokinetics and safety in humans. Diazepam <b>rectal</b> <b>gel</b> (Diastat®) is the only FDA-approved product indicated for acute repetitive seizures. Despite its proven efficacy, most older children and adults object to this route of administration. As a result, many patients do not realize {{the benefit of a}} therapy that can improve outcomes and decrease healthcare costs. Intranasal administration of benzodiazepines offers a potential alternative. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} compare the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of two novel intranasal diazepam formulations versus intravenous administration in healthy volunteers. Twenty-four healthy volunteers were randomized into an open-label, three-way crossover study. Ten mg doses of two investigational intranasal diazepam formulations (solution, suspension) and a 5 mg intravenous dose of commercially available diazepam injectable, USP were given. A two-week washout period separated treatments. Plasma samples for diazepam analysis were collected pre-dose and at regular intervals up to 240 hours post-dose. diazepam concentration-time data were analyzed using a non-compartmental pharmacokinetics approach. Exposure following administration of diazepam intranasal solution (absolute bioavailability - 97 %) was greater than the intranasal suspension (absolute bioavailability- 67 %). Both investigational intranasal formulations were well tolerated. The results of this pilot study indicate that development of an intranasal diazepam formulation with high bioavailability, reasonable variability, and good tolerability is feasible. Further, a PK model was developed and simulation studies were performed to optimize future bioequivalence trials. Absorption characteristics of rectal and nasal diazepam formulations were compared using the deconvolution analysis. An additional identified problem that this thesis work aims to address is management of baclofen withdrawal. The current recommended management strategies for baclofen withdrawal are inadequate and availability of intravenous baclofen would permit rapid attainment of drug concentrations in plasma as well as accurate and precise dose titration, thus allowing for prevention and expeditious treatment of withdrawal symptoms and reduced risk of adverse effects. The objective was to characterize baclofen pharmacokinetics and safety given orally and intravenously. Twelve healthy subjects were enrolled in a randomized, open-label, crossover study and received single doses of baclofen: 3 or 5 mg given IV and 5 or 10 mg taken orally with a 48 -hr washout. Blood samples for baclofen analysis were collected pre-dose and at regular intervals up to 24 hours post-dose. Clinical response was assessed by sedation scores, ataxia and nystagmus. Mean absolute bioavailability of oral baclofen was 74 %. Dose-adjusted areas under the curve (AUC) between the oral and IV arms were statistically different (p= 0. 0024), while AUC variability was similar (co-efficient of variation: 18 - 24 %). Adverse effects were mild in severity and not related to either dose or route of administration. Three and 5 mg IV doses of baclofen were well tolerated. Seventy-four percent oral bioavailability indicates that smaller doses of IV baclofen are needed to attain comparable total drug exposures. Both intranasal diazepam and intravenous baclofen hold promise in management of seizure emergencies and baclofen withdrawal, respectively. Results from studies described in this thesis will inform the design of subsequent clinical studies that are needed for market approval...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Chronic {{constipation}} {{in children}} {{can be linked to}} cow"s milk intolerance (CMI) but the existence of a food intolerance-dependent proctitis is still debated. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the histologic data in patients with food intolerance-related constipation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive patients (22 M, median age 4 years) with chronic constipation unresponsive to common treatment were enrolled. All patients were put on a cow"s milk-free diet for 4 weeks and those uncured on this diet underwent a subsequent 4 -week period of oligoantigenic diet. In the patients cured on elimination diet, a subsequent double-blind food challenge was performed to confirm the diagnosis of food intolerance. At entry to the study, routine hemato-chemical and immunologic assays, rectoscopy, and histologic study of the rectal mucosa were performed. In the patients cured on elimination diet, rectal histology was repeated when they were cured. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were found to be suffering from CMI and 6 from multiple food intolerance. These patients had a normal stool frequency on elimination diet, while constipation reappeared on food challenge. The condition of the remaining 22 patients did not improve on elimination diet. The patients with food intolerance showed a significantly higher frequency of erosions of the mucosa, number of intraepithelial lymphocytes and eosinophils, and number of eosinophils in the lamina propria. Study of the <b>rectal</b> mucus <b>gel</b> layer showed that the food-intolerant patients had a significantly lower thickness than the other subjects studied. In the food intolerant patients, histologic abnormalities disappeared on elimination diet, when the patients were well. CONCLUSIONS: Food intolerance-related constipation is characterized by proctitis with eosinophil infiltrate of the rectal mucosa. A reduced mucus gel layer can be considered a contributory factor in the pathogenesis of the constipation...|$|R
40|$|Individuals {{practicing}} unprotected receptive {{anal intercourse}} are at particularly {{high risk of}} HIV infection. Men {{who have sex with}} men (MSM) in the developed and developing world continue to have disproportionate and increasing levels of HIV infection. The past few years have seen important progress in demonstrating the efficacy of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), vaginal microbicides, and treatment as prevention, but there has also been significant progress in the development of rectal microbicides. The purpose of this review is to summarize the status of rectal microbicide research and to identify opportunities, challenges, and future directions in this important field of HIV prevention. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent phase 1 rectal microbicide studies have characterized the safety, acceptability, compartmental pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of both UC 781 and tenofovir gels.

40|$|Purpose: Dynamic high-field {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) defecography including the evacuation phase is a promising {{tool for the}} assessment of functional pelvic disorders, nowadays seen with increasing frequency in elderly women in particular. Learning objectives: 1. To describe the adequate technique of dynamic high-field MRI (3 T) in assessing pelvic floor disorders. 2. To provide an overview of the most common pathologies occurring during the evacuation phase, especially in comparison with results of conventional defecography. Methods and materials: After description of the ideal technical parameters of MR defecography performed in supine position after <b>gel</b> <b>rectal</b> filling with a 3 Tesla unit and including the evacuation phase we stress the importance of using a standardized evaluation system for the exact assessment of pelvic floor pathophysiology.

The analysis of release mechanism showed that the release of etodolac was proportional to the square root of time, indicating that etodolac might be released from the suppositories by Fickian diffusion (n ranged from 0. 220 - 0. 498). The release rate constant was between 5. 431 and 17. 349 %/min(n). The anti-inflammatory effect of etodolac poloxamer gel was also studied in rats. Moreover, liquid suppository of etodolac did not cause any morphological damage to the rectal tissues. These results suggested that in situ gelling liquid suppository with etodolac and mucoadhesive polymer was a physically safe, convenient, and effective rectal dosage form for etodolacKing Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were {{to explore the}} {{clinical}} pharmacology of ropivacaine gel as a potential new rectal therapy for ulcerative colitis (UC). The studies included pharmacokinetics, tolerability, preliminary efficacy in patients, formulation factors and drug-drug interactions. These results {{paved the way for}} the start of a larger scale dose finding study in patients. UC is an idiopathic inflammation involving part of or the entire colon, and characterised by early onset and often a chronic intermittent or continuous course. UC is described as the result of a disturbed intestinal immune response. Ropivacaine is a long-acting local anaesthetic of the amidetype, and pre-clinical investigations in vitro and in vivo show that ropivacaine has an antiinflammatory activity, which, in addition to the local anaesthetic activity, makes the compound interesting as a treatment of UC. The single dose pharmacokinetics of rectally administered ropivacaine were characterised by dose proportionality. The mean bioavailability was 60 % with a range from 30 % to 70 %, as determined after simultaneous administration of rectal ropivacaine and intravenous (iv) deuteriumlabelled drug. The metabolic pattern was similar after single dose iv and single dose rectal administration in healthy subjects and patients. However, after multiple dose rectal administration the levels of the active metabolite 2, 6 -pipecoloxylidide (PPX) increased during the first days due to the long half-life causing a longer time to steady state. The levels of unbound ropivacaine concentrations remained stable during multiple dose administration in patients with UC whereas the total concentrations fluctuated in parallel with the alpha- 1 -acid glycoprotein levels. These findings illustrate the importance of monitoring concentrations of metabolites and unbound concentrations of drug, especially if the therapeutic window is narrow. Ropivacaine was absorbed to a higher extent from colon in patients with UC in comparison to healthy subjects, a finding that could be related to the characteristics of the inflamed mucosa. The local and systemic tolerability of ropivacaine was good. The first open study in patients with distal UC showed promising results. Mucosal inflammation assessed endoscopically at the most severely affected site decreased after two weeks of treatment. There was also a trend towards histological improvement. Clinical symptoms, including total number of stools, blood in stools, diarrhoea and tenesmus decreased after only a few days treatment. These results resembled those in the second patient study when a prompt decrease in inflammation and symptoms was also recorded in some patients. The main objective of this second patient study was to evaluate anorectal manometry recordings of rectal sensitivity and reactivity as a biomarker for the pharmacological effect of rectal ropivacaine treatment in UC. The clinical effects did not parallel the manometric findings, which may be explained by different kinetics of rectal sensitivity and mucosal inflammation. Fluvoxamine (a CYP 1 A 2 inhibitor), but not ketoconazole (a CYP 3 A 4 inhibitor), significantly affected the clearance of ropivacaine after single iv administration. This study confirms the in vitro findings indicating CYP 1 A 2 as the most important enzyme in ropivacaine metabolism. Consequently, CYP 1 A 2 inhibitors may cause clinically relevant interactions with ropivacaine. The colonic spread of 20 ml to 80 ml <b>rectal</b> ropivacaine <b>gel</b> was studied to guide the eligibility of patients for the clinical studies in later phases of development. To achieve a local effect it is believed that the formulation should spread over the inflamed part of colon. The spread of ropivacaine gel was limited to the descending colon and there was no or minor differences between the studied volumes. The limited spread could be related to the higher viscosity of the present formulation in comparison to commercially available formulations for treatment of UC. These studies represent an example of the early phase in the development of a previously registered drug on a new indication. This is an important pathway of drug development, of interest both for the patient and the pharmaceutical industry...|$|R
40|$|The rectum is {{particularly}} vulnerable to HIV transmission having only a single protective layer of columnar epithelium overlying tissue rich in activated lymphoid cells; thus, unprotected anal intercourse in {{both women and men}} carries a higher risk of infection than other sexual routes. In the absence of effective prophylactic vaccines, increasing attention is being given to the use of microbicides and preventative antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. To prevent mucosal transmission of HIV, a microbicide/ARV should ideally act locally at and near the virus portal of entry. As part of an integrated rectal microbicide development programme, we have evaluated rectal application of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor tenofovir (PMPA, 9 -[(R) - 2 -(phosphonomethoxy) propyl] adenine monohydrate), a drug licensed for therapeutic use, for protective efficacy against rectal challenge with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in a well-established and standardised macaque model. A total of 20 purpose-bred Indian rhesus macaques were used to evaluate the protective efficacy of topical tenofovir. Nine animals received 1 % tenofovir gel per rectum up to 2 h prior to virus challenge, four macaques received placebo gel, and four macaques remained untreated. In addition, three macaques were given tenofovir gel 2 h after virus challenge. Following intrarectal instillation of 20 median rectal infectious doses (MID 50) of a noncloned, virulent stock of SIVmac 251 / 32 H, all animals were analysed for virus infection, by virus isolation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), quantitative proviral DNA load in PBMC, plasma viral RNA (vRNA) load by sensitive quantitative competitive (qc) RT-PCR, and presence of SIV-specific serum antibodies by ELISA. We report here a significant protective effect (p = 0. 003; Fisher exact probability test) wherein eight of nine macaques given tenofovir per rectum up to 2 h prior to virus challenge were protected from infection (n = 6) or had modified virus outcomes (n = 2), while all untreated macaques and three of four macaques given placebo gel were infected, as were two of three animals receiving tenofovir gel after challenge. Moreover, analysis of lymphoid tissues post mortem failed to reveal sequestration of SIV in the protected animals. We found a strong positive association between the concentration of tenofovir in the plasma 15 min after <b>rectal</b> application of <b>gel</b> and the degree of protection in the six animals challenged with virus at this time point. Moreover, colorectal explants from non-SIV challenged tenofovir-treated macaques were resistant to infection ex vivo, whereas no inhibition was seen in explants from the small intestine. Tissue-specific inhibition of infection was associated with the intracellular detection of tenofovir. Intriguingly, in the absence of seroconversion, Gag-specific gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) -secreting T cells were detected in the blood of four of seven protected animals tested, with frequencies ranging from 144 spot forming cells (SFC) / 10 (6) PBMC to 261 spot forming cells (SFC) / 10 (6) PBMC. These results indicate that colorectal pretreatment with ARV drugs, such as tenofovir, has potential as a clinically relevant strategy for the prevention of HIV transmission. We conclude that plasma tenofovir concentration measured 15 min after rectal administration may serve as a surrogate indicator of protective efficacy. This may prove to be useful in the design of clinical studies. Furthermore, in vitro intestinal explants served as a model for drug distribution in vivo and susceptibility to virus infection. The finding of T cell priming following exposure to virus in the absence of overt infection is provocative. Further studies would reveal if a combined modality microbicide and vaccination strategy is feasible by determining the full extent of local immune responses induced and their protective potential...|$|R
