5|$|All of the {{alkali metals}} except lithium and caesium {{have at least}} one {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope: sodium-22 and sodium-24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically, potassium-40 and rubidium-87 have very long half-lives and thus occur naturally, and all isotopes of francium are <b>radioactive.</b> <b>Caesium</b> was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century, although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes. (Francium had not been discovered yet at that time.) The natural long-lived radioisotope of potassium, potassium-40, makes up about 0.012% of natural potassium, and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive. This natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 (the next alkali metal after caesium) in 1925. Natural rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive, with 27.83% being the long-lived radioisotope rubidium-87.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{studies found}} that {{although}} the mushroom bioaccumulates mercury and cobalt from the soil, occasional consumption of mushrooms should not cause maximum allowable intake doses to be exceeded. Similar conclusions about safety were made in a Polish study of the mushroom's ability to accumulate organochlorine compounds. Different methods of preparation for consumption affect the leaching rate of cadmium, lead, and mercury. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, several studies showed I.badia bioaccumulates <b>radioactive</b> <b>caesium,</b> 137Cs. 137Cs is produced in nuclear power plants following the chain decay of 235U to 137Te, and has a half-life of thirty years. A German study showed that mushrooms collected from 1986 to 1988 had radiocaesium contents that were 8.3 to 13.6 times greater than mushrooms collected before the accident in 1985. This caesium-sequestering effect {{is caused by a}} brown pigment, the polyphenol compound norbadione A, which is related to a family of mushroom pigments known as pulvinic acids. Norbadione A has been investigated for its ability to provide a protective effect against the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. Tests with cell cultures and mice show that although it has some protective effect, it is toxic to cells in higher doses. A new series of alkali chelators based on the structure of norbadione A has been reported. The mushroom may have potential as a bioremediation agent to clean up contaminated sites.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} predict the {{consequences}} of an accidental release of radioactive nuclides relies mainly {{on the level of}} understanding of the mechanisms involved in radioactive nuclides interactions with different components of agricultural and natural ecosystems and their formalisation into predictive models. Numerous studies and databases about contaminated agricultural and natural areas have been obtained but their use to enhance our prediction ability has been largely limited by their unresolved variability. Such variability seems to stem from an incomplete knowledge about radioactive nuclide interactions with the soil matrix, soil moisture, biological elements in the soil and additional pollutants, which may be found in such soils.

40|$|Radiocaesium (134 Cs, 137 Cs) is of {{environmental}} concern {{because of its}} incorporation into the food chain and prolonged emission of harmful radiation. Plants take up caesium via cation transporters which cannot discriminate between <b>radioactive</b> and stable <b>caesium</b> (133 Cs). Around 80 % of angiosperms live in symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi that deliver mineral nutrients to their hosts. Contrasting effects of AM fungi on caesium accumulation by plants have been reported. The ultimate aim of this thesis {{was to determine whether}} AM fungi reduced caesium accumulation in Medicago truncatula by down regulating the expression of plant genes encoding specific potassium transporters through improving potassium nutrition of their hosts. Accumulation of potassium and stable caesium by non mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal Medicago truncatula was studied, and the effects of caesium and AM fungi on plant gene expression were investigated. In these experiments, shoot potassium concentrations of non mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal plants were identical. However, in some experiments AM associations decreased shoot caesium concentrations. These observations were also true for five other plant species studied. Colonisation of Medicago truncatula with Glomus sp. influenced expression of some genes encoding cation transport proteins, but the expression profile did not suggest improved potassium nutrition. The presence of caesium also affected the expression of several putative cation transporters, but the consequences of these changes are unknown. A reduced colonisation rate of Medicago truncatula by Glomus intraradices was observed at caesium concentrations that exist in the rhizosphere. In conclusion, in these experiments, AM fungi did not improve plant potassium nutrition, and {{there was no evidence that}} AM fungi reduced caesium accumulation by down regulating expression of plant genes encoding potassium transporters. Although colonisation by AM fungi can reduce shoot caesium concentrations, this was not always observed. Thus, fungal inoculation cannot be relied upon to deliver crops with reduced radiocaesium concentrations. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
