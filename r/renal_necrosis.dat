50|$|Hymenoxys odorata is {{poisonous}} to livestock; it {{is mostly}} a problem of the sheep industry. The toxic compounds are sesquiterpene lactones called hymenovin and hymenoxon. When ingested by sheep the plant produces inflammation of the stomach, <b>renal</b> <b>necrosis,</b> and toxic hepatitis, as well as inhibition of clotting factors. An ill sheep may be bloated, anorexic, weak, drooling, and vomiting. Acute and chronic, cumulative poisoning is often fatal.

40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF 121) protects rats from renal {{infarction}} in thrombotic microangiopathy. BackgroundRenal thrombotic microangiopathy, typified by the hemolytic uremic syndrome, {{is associated with}} endothelial cell injury in which the presence of cortical necrosis, extensive glomerular involvement, and arterial occlusive lesions correlates with a poor clinical outcome. We hypothesized that the endothelial survival factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may provide protection. MethodSevere, necrotizing, thrombotic microangiopathy was induced in rats by the renal artery perfusion of antiglomerular endothelial antibody, followed by the administration of VEGF or vehicle, and renal injury was evaluated. ResultsControl rats developed severe glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury with extensive <b>renal</b> <b>necrosis.</b> The administration of VEGF significantly reduced the necrosis, preserved the glomerular endothelium and arterioles, and {{reduced the number of}} apoptotic cells in glomeruli (at 4 hours) and in the tubulointerstitium (at 4 days). The prosurvival effect of VEGF for endothelium may relate in part to the ability of VEGF to protect endothelial cells from factor-induced apoptosis, as demonstrated for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which was shown to be up-regulated through the course of this model of renal microangiopathy. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression was preserved in VEGF-treated rats compared with its marked decrease in the surviving glomeruli and interstitium of the antibody-treated rats that did not receive VEGF. ConclusionsVEGF protects against <b>renal</b> <b>necrosis</b> in this model of thrombotic microangiopathy. This protection may be mediated by maintaining endothelial nitric oxide production and/or preventing endothelial cell death...|$|E

40|$|The nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug diclofenac {{is extremely}} toxic to Old World Gyps vultures (median lethal dose ~ 0. 1 – 0. 2 mg/kg), evoking visceral gout, <b>renal</b> <b>necrosis,</b> and mortality {{within a few}} days of exposure. Unintentional secondary poisoning of vultures that fed upon carcasses of diclofenac-treated livestock decimated populations in the Indian subcontinent. Because of the widespread use of diclofenac and other cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibiting drugs, a toxicological study was undertaken in turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) as an initial step in examining sensitivity of New World scavenging birds. Two trials were conducted entailing oral gavage of diclofenac at doses ranging from 0. 08 to 25 mg/kg body weight. Birds were observed for 7 d, blood samples were collected for plasma chemistry (predose and 12, 24, and 48 h and 7 d postdose), and select individuals were necropsied. Diclofenac failed to evoke overt signs of toxicity, visceral gout, <b>renal</b> <b>necrosis,</b> or elevate plasma uric acid at concentrations greater than 100 times the estimated median lethal dose reported for Gyps vultures. For turkey vultures receiving 8 or 25 mg/kg, the plasma half-life of diclofenac was estimated to be 6 h, and it was apparently cleared after several days as no residues were detectable in liver or kidney at necropsy.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that exogenous and endogenous A 1 adenosine receptor (A 1 AR) activation protected against renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in mice by induction and phosphorylation of {{heat shock protein}} 27 (HSP 27). With global overexpression of HSP 27 in mice, however, there was a paradoxical increase in systemic inflammation with increased renal injury after an ischemic insult due to increased NK 1. 1 cytotoxicity. In this study, we hypothesized that selective renal expression of HSP 27 in mice would improve renal function and reduce injury after IR. Mice were subjected to renal IR injury 2 days after intrarenal injection of saline or a lentiviral construct encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or human HSP 27 coexpressing EGFP (EGFP-huHSP 27). Mice with kidney-specific reconstitution of huHSP 27 had significantly lower plasma creatinine, <b>renal</b> <b>necrosis,</b> apoptosis, and inflammation as demonstrated by decreased proinflammatory cytokine mRNA induction and neutrophil infiltration.

40|$|The role of drug {{metabolism}} in chemical-induced liver injury is reviewed. Parameters {{for studying the}} formition of chemically reactive metabolites are discussed and the factors that alter the formation and covalent binding of reactive metabolites are selectively emphasized. Some of the experimental work that led to these concepts is discussed, especially the chemical toxicology of the hepatic injury produced by acetaminophen, bromobenzene, furosemide, isoniazid and iproniazid. An important result of {{drug metabolism}} studies {{in recent years has}} been the realization that many foreign compounds are metabolized by the liver and certain other tissues to potent alkylating, arylating, or free-radical intermediates (1 - 12). Such studies demonstrate how chemically stable compounds can produce serious tissue lesions in man and experimental animals, including neoplasia, hepatic and <b>renal</b> <b>necrosis,</b> bone marrow aplasia, and other injuries. These studies frequently demonstrate a role for sulfhydryl containing compounds, particularly glutathione, in protecting tissues from such toxic reactions. Many of the initial concepts of metabolic activation were developed during studies of chemical carcinogenesis; the work of the Millers in the United States (1, 2) and of Magee and co-workers in England (3) has been especially illuminating. The realization that the enzyme pathways responsible for the metabolic activation of carcinogens are the same microsomal mixed-function oxidases that metabolize most drugs and other xenobiotics led to the concept that drug-induced tissue lesions might also be mediated through the covalent binding of reactive metabolites (6 - 11).

40|$|The {{roles of}} sphingosine kinases SK 1 and SK 2 in ischemia–reperfusion injury {{have not been}} fully elucidated since studies have found {{beneficial}} effects of SK 1 while others showed no role in this injury. To help resolve this, we used SK 1 or SK 2 knockout mice and confirmed that renal ischemia–reperfusion injury induced SK 1, but not SK 2, in the kidneys. Furthermore, knockout or pharmacological inhibition of SK 1 increased injury after renal ischemia–reperfusion injury. In contrast, lack of SK 2 conferred renal protection following injury. In addition, we used lentiviral gene delivery to selectively express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or human SK 1 coexpressed with EGFP (EGFP-huSK 1) in the kidney. Mice with kidney-specific overexpression of EGFP-huSK 1 had significantly improved renal function with lower plasma creatinine, <b>renal</b> <b>necrosis,</b> apoptosis, and inflammation. Moreover, EGFP-huSK 1 overexpression in cultured human proximal tubule (HK- 2) cells protected against peroxide-induced necrosis. Selective overexpression of EGFP-huSK 1 led to increased HSP 27 mRNA and protein expression in vivo and in vitro. Functional protection as well as induction of HSP 27 with EGFP-huSK 1 overexpression in vivo was blocked with sphingosine- 1 -phosphate- 1 receptor 1 (S 1 P 1) antagonism.

40|$|Receptor-interacting {{protein kinase}} 3 (RIPK 3) -mediated necroptosis {{is thought to}} be the pathophysiologically {{predominant}} pathway that leads to regulated necrosis of parenchymal cells in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), and loss of either Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) or caspase- 8 is known to sensitize tissues to undergo spontaneous necroptosis. Here, we demonstrate that renal tubules do not undergo sensitization to necroptosis upon genetic ablation of either FADD or caspase- 8 and that the RIPK 1 inhibitor necrostatin- 1 (Nec- 1) does not protect freshly isolated tubules from hypoxic injury. In contrast, irondependent ferroptosis directly causes synchronized necrosis of renal tubules, as demonstrated by intravital microscopy in models of IRI and oxalate crystal-induced acute kidney injury. To suppress ferroptosis in vivo, we generated a novel third-generation ferrostatin (termed 16 - 86), which we demonstrate to be more stable, to metabolism and plasma, and more potent, compared with the firstin- class compound ferrostatin- 1 (Fer- 1). Even in conditions with extraordinarily severe IRI, 16 - 86 exerts strong protection to an extent which has not previously allowed survival in any murine setting. In addition, 16 - 86 further potentiates the strong protective effect on IRI mediated by combination therapy with necrostatins and compounds that inhibit mitochondrial permeability transition. Renal tubules thus represent a tissue that is not sensitized to necroptosis by loss of FADD or caspase- 8.
