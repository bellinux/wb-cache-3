The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s the American Bar Association {{presented}} {{a statue of}} Blackstone to the English Bar Association, however, at the time, the sculpture was too tall {{to be placed in}} the Royal Courts of Justice in London.

Congress approved the placement of the sculpture in Washington, D.C. on 15 March 1943, and appropriated $10,000 for the installation. The bronze statue is a nine-foot (2.7 m) standing portrait of Blackstone wearing judicial <b>robes</b> <b>and</b> a long curly wig, holding a copy of Commentaries.

5|$|The Emir's brother, Prime Minister Nasrullah Khan, {{was a man}} of {{religious}} convictions. Unlike the Emir, he fluently spoke Pashto (the local language), dressed in traditional Afghan <b>robes,</b> <b>and</b> interacted more closely with the border tribes. While the Emir favoured British India, Nasrullah Khan was more pro-German in his sympathies. Nasrullah's views were shared by his nephew, Amanullah Khan, the youngest and most charismatic of the Emir's sons. The eldest son, Inayatullah Khan, {{was in charge of the}} Afghan army. The mission therefore expected more sympathy and consideration from Nasrullah and Amanullah than from the emir.|$|E
