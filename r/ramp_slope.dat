40|$|Lower Tortonian {{distally}} steepened carbonate ramp of Menorca mostly {{consists of}} foramol and rhodalgal facies deposited in inner-middle ramp, <b>ramp</b> <b>slope</b> and outer ramp settings. Red algae are abundant {{from the middle}} ramp to {{the lower part of}} the slope and their taxonomic assemblages are clearly related to the bathymetric position. Melobesioids percentage increases basinward, passing from 55. 8 % in the middle ramp to 97 % in the toe of slope. Mastophoroids are more abundant in the middle ramp (43. 1 %) and decrease toward deeper paleoenvironments (1. 2 %). Lithophylloids and sporolithaceans appear as accessory components from the middle ramp to slope settings. The percentage of melobesioids and mastophoroids observed in the middle ramp suggest that growth of the rhodoliths started in a water depth below 10 – 20 m. The deepest occurrence of the rhodoliths is in the <b>ramp</b> <b>slope</b> environment, where the dominance of melobesioids and the low percentage of shallower-water subfamily suggests a water depth range of 70 to 100 m. Shape and structure of rhodoliths are indicative of high-energy conditions in all ramp settings and they do not reflect a decrease in hydrodynamic energy related to water depth increase. These conditions are related to the presence of unidirectional currents that produced cross-bedded grainstones existing in the middle ramp, <b>ramp</b> <b>slope</b> and at the toe of the <b>ramp</b> <b>slope</b> settings. The high percentage of mastophoroids in the shallowest environments and the presence of Lithoporella and Sporolithon in the coralline assemblages suggests that carbonate production took place in tropical waters...|$|E

No amorphous layers and secondary phases were observed at the barrier interfaces. For a gentle ramp junction, small misoriented grains appeared in some portions of the barrier. The substrate ramp formed during the ion etching process had little influence on the growth of the upper layers. In junctions with a steep ramp, defects increased near the interface, although the epitaxy of the barrier was of good quality. The results demonstrate that the slope angle of the junction ramp is an important factor that influences the performance of the Josephson junctions. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|In {{carbonate}} depositional environments, sediment {{is mostly}} produced by {{different groups of}} organisms. Ecological parameters, thus, {{play a major role}} controlling carbonate production. In the present work, carbonate-producing biota, especially foraminifers, are studied to construct a depositional model and paleoecological interpretation of the lower Tortonian distally steepened ramp of Menorca (Balearic Islands, Spain). This carbonate platform corresponds to a highstand systems track prograding and aggrading over a Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and, locally, lower Tertiary basement. Outcrops are excellently exposed {{in the southern part of}} the island. Five facies associations are observed, which, in downdip direction, correspond to inner ramp, middle ramp, <b>ramp</b> <b>slope,</b> toe of the slope, and outer ramp. Samples have been studied using point counting of 102 thin sections. Six foraminiferal assemblages have been distinguished. Eight microfacies are identified (IR. 1, IR. 2, MR, URS, LRS, TS. 1, TS. 2, and OR), based on the abundance and ecological significance of the foraminifers (large benthic foraminifers, epiphytics, low-oxygen indicators, and planktonics) and other carbonate-producing organisms (echinoids, mollusks, barnacles, bryozoans, serpulids, coral genus Pontes, and green and red algae). Seagrass meadows in the inner ramp correspond to the euphotic carbonate factory, whereas red algae and large benthic foraminifers dominate the oligophotic carbonate factory in the middle ramp and upper <b>ramp</b> <b>slope.</b> Microfacies composition verified intense sediment-transport processes from inner and middle ramp down to lower <b>ramp</b> <b>slope,</b> toe of the slope, and outer ramp.
