5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{concluded that}} the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors {{and that there was}} no fault with the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset localizer approach for setting approach course on the HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being blown to the left and needed to adjust course to the right. Because he was in a stressed situation, the navigator set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to <b>recheck</b> his work, allowing mistakes to happen, and his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the navigator was overworked, it was inappropriate for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of lateral control to him.|$|E

Three days later they spent an enjoyable day on {{the summit of the}} Bell mountain. Darwin visited a copper mine and spent five days scrambling in the mountains before going on to Santiago, Chile. On his way back, he fell ill on 20 September and had to spend a month in bed. It is possible that he contracted Chagas' disease here, leading to his health problems after his return to England, but this diagnosis of his symptoms is disputed. He learnt that the Admiralty had reprimanded FitzRoy for buying the Adventure. FitzRoy had taken it badly, selling the ship and announcing they would go back to <b>recheck</b> his survey, then had resigned his command doubting his sanity, but was persuaded by his officers to withdraw his resignation and proceed. The artist Conrad Martens left the ship and took passage to Australia.|$|E

25|$|At Valparaiso in 1834, while Charles Darwin {{was away}} from the ship {{exploring}} the Andes, the Admiralty reprimanded FitzRoy for buying the Adventure. He took the criticism badly, selling the schooner and announcing they {{would go back to}} <b>recheck</b> his survey, then resigning his command with doubts about his sanity. The ship's officers persuaded him to withdraw his resignation and continue as planned once Darwin returned to the ship. FitzRoy continued his voyage, sailing on to the Galapagos, Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. He detoured to Bahia in Brazil on the return voyage so that he could carry out an additional check, to ensure the accuracy of his longitude measurements before returning to England.|$|E
500|$|On 4 April {{they entered}} the harbour of Rio de Janeiro, to make {{observations}} of longitude from Villegagnon Island. Darwin took in the sights of the city then made an expedition into the interior, returning to the ship on 24 April. By then Robert McCormick had left the ship, with permission from the admiral in command, and returned to England. Assistant Surgeon Benjamin Bynoe was made acting surgeon in his place. McCormick felt [...] "very much disappointed in my expectations of carrying out my natural history pursuits, every obstacle having been placed {{in the way of}} my getting on shore and making collections" [...] while the gentleman Darwin received all the invitations from dignitaries onshore and was given facilities to pack his collections. On 26 April Darwin moved into a house he had rented at Botafogo, and stayed there with three others when the Beagle left on 10 May to <b>recheck</b> observations at Bahia. FitzRoy had found a discrepancy of [...] in the meridian distance of longitude between his measurements and those of Albin Roussin, and decided to go back. A seaman, a ship's boy and a young midshipman had caught a fever after visiting the Macacu River, and died. When the ship returned to Rio on 3 June, FitzRoy confirmed that his measurements of Bahia and of the Abrolhos reefs were correct, and sent these corrections to Roussin. They sailed from Rio on 5 July.|$|E

40|$|An Analysis of the Validation of the Quality Achievement Tests in the Learning Program Implementation. This study aims to {{investigate}} the test types developed by FE YSU, {{the steps of the}} development and validation, and the quality based on theories. This study was a survey involving 192 lecturers who taught basic science and technology subjects in the odd semester of 2008 / 2009. The sample, consisting of 92 lecturers, was selected using the proportional random sampling technique. The data were collected through documents and questionnaires and analyzed using the descriptive quantitative technique. The results showed that 1) 55. 42 % of the lecturers developed essays tests for measuring learning achievement, 13. 03 % developed objective tests, and 31. 55 % combined both; 2) in the test development process, 35. 87 % made the test blue-prints and 23. 92 % did not; only 13. 59 % developed new tests, 2. 74 % used old tests, and 46. 19 % combined the old tests with the new ones; 3) 54. 89 % <b>rechecked</b> the tests and 3. 73 % did not, 25. 50 % <b>rechecked</b> the tests by themselves and 17. 85 % <b>rechecked</b> the tests with group members of the same subject, 2. 18 % had other lecturers fully check the tests, 32. 85 % <b>rechecked</b> the essay tests, 11. 18 % <b>rechecked</b> the objective tests, and 91 % <b>rechecked</b> mostly the relevance between the test and the learning competence; and 4) theoretically, 87 % of the tests developed by lecturers were good in terms of the essence of the test quality.

40|$|Background: The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) is {{implementing}} the External Quality assurance (EQA) and Random blinded re-checking (RBRC) {{as one of}} its important component. This nationwide study was conducted to determine (1) the number and types of RBRC errors and (2) the sensitivity and specificity among <b>rechecked</b> slides. Materials and Methods: The study was based on the monthly RBRC reports submitted by ~ 13, 000 designated microscopy centres (DMCs) across the country under routine programmatic settings in 2010. The DMCs reports were compiled at district, state and national level. Results: A total of 11, 89, 564 slides were <b>rechecked</b> from 11, 039 DMCs. Of which 99. 5 % of <b>rechecked</b> slides did not have any errors. The sensitivity and specificity of the <b>rechecked</b> slides had 98 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. Conclusion: RBRC is the crucial component of EQA and the results from the programme are found to be satisfactory. Based on the study findings, the earlier value of 80 % sensitivity used for calculation of annual sample size for RBRC has been increased to 90 % sensitivity. The annual RBRC sample size for DMCs has been increased by 1. 5 – 2 folds...|$|R

40|$|SETTING: Routine {{tuberculosis}} control services in Burundi. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether systematic restaining of sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) prior to <b>rechecking</b> quality assessment is necessary. DESIGN: Blinded <b>rechecking</b> of peripheral routine smears, including a second control of discordants, {{before and after}} restaining. RESULTS: Without restaining, 10 / 825 (1. 2 %) negative, and 59 / 189 (31. 2 %) positive results were declared false. After restaining, there were 34 (4. 1 %) false negatives and 13 (6. 9 %) false positives, both highly significant changes. Before restaining, quantification of positive smears was usually considered too high, while after restaining 41 out of 42 positives {{were found to have}} too low readings. CONCLUSIONS: Despite mild climatic conditions in Burundi, restaining all slides before <b>rechecking</b> revealed an unrecognised, widespread problem of false negatives, rather than false positives. This indicated the need for critical re-appraisal of the standard procedure using cold staining, rather than re-training, as would have been inferred from results without restaining. Systematic restaining of all slides prior to <b>rechecking</b> may be more widely needed in National Tuberculosis Programmes to cover all possible serious causes of error. Cold staining should be avoided in field programmes since its performance is easily affected by frequently encountered adverse factors...|$|R
