30|$|A growing {{issue in}} the paralympic {{movement}} {{is the impact of}} equipment on performance. In this systematic review, equipment was defined as a covariate in relation to the study goal. Athletes are competitive by nature and will try to enhance their performance as well as limit the impact of impairment on performance by using optimised equipment. This use of equipment is sport specific and often based on experience. However, the equipment permitted in wheelchair court sports shows similarities across sports [12 - 14]. Studies in this review explored the use of belts and straps, wheelchair set up, seating configuration and functional electrical stimulation (FES). Two studies assessed the possible influence of equipment in relation to trunk impairment [36, 38] though equipment that is not used for wheelchair court sports was tested [13, 16]. The only study that assessed equipment used in court sports found that multidirectional reach improves in athletes with SCI by the use of a thigh or trunk belt [31]. Reach {{is only one of the}} many relevant activities for wheelchair court sport, and in addition to belting, the chair set up (position of the seat and the backrest and height of the backrest) is also believed to impact on reach [16]. In one study, FES of the trunk extensor muscles was used to improve unsupported seating and to lift objects with different weights [39]. Functional electrical stimulation primarily impacts on impairment in muscle strength. The use of implanted electrodes as a piece of equipment is new to moment in the paralympic movement. So far, there is no consensus if this equipment should be allowed during sport performance and whether or not this equipment should be part of athlete evaluation in classification [43]. On the other hand, in the study exploring the effect of trunk impairment on acceleration in wheelchair racing, athletes used their own custom designed wheelchair. It must be noted that a racing wheelchair seating configuration is quite different from the configuration of a wheelchair for court sports. Opposite to wheelchairs used for court sports, the racing wheelchair does not have <b>rear</b> <b>castor</b> wheels to prevent tipping when maximum force is applied on the wheel [44]. As a consequence of the absence of the castor wheel, the racing athletes in this study may not have been able to use maximum force in accelerating, because of the risk of tipping backward. This limits the generalisation of the results of this study regarding the impact of trunk impairment on acceleration to wheelchair court sports. Additional research is necessary to examine the acceleration in a court sports wheelchair with the typical <b>rear</b> <b>castor</b> wheels to determine if trunk muscle strength does impact on acceleration when tipping of the chair is prevented.|$|E

30|$|From {{biological}} studies, it is {{concluded that}} the shortest durations of incubation, life span, longevity, and oviposition periods were recorded when T. urticae was <b>reared</b> on <b>castor</b> bean leaves, while total immature stages and life cycle were shortest when spider mite was fed on mulberry leaves. The greatest values of reproduction rate and hatchability were found on mulberry leaves than other crops and followed by castor bean. Sex ratio of T. urticae was highest on castor bean leaves. The developmental and reproduction rate of T. urticae are influenced by species of host plant and tissue nutrient content for host plant.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{shifting}} Spodoptera littoralis larvae from a host plant to another {{pointed out that}} pupal weight, growth index, female longevity and fecundity were affected. Host plants considered were okra, tomato and castor oil plants. Larvae were reared for three successive generations under laboratory conditions (25 - 30 ˚C, 70 %R. H. and 12 D: 12 L) {{on each of the}} three chosen plants, and then shifted to each of the other two hosts. Larvae <b>reared</b> continuously on <b>castor</b> oil leaves, okra and tomato leaves then shifted to either one of the other plants induced a highly significant decrease in the mean pupal weight. Shifting from the favourable host (castor oil leaves) to either okra or tomato leaves, highly significantly decrease the growth rate and the mean number of eggs deposited by the female. Shifting from castor oil leaves to either okra or tomato induced insignificant increase in the female longevity. Phytochemical analysis showed that, castor oil leaves, possess a high value of total carbohydrates, total proteins and nitrogen meanwhile the phenolic compounds were present at a low value level. Biochemical analysis showed that both essential and non essential amino acid were higher in the hemolymph of the last larval instars of S. littoralis <b>reared</b> on <b>castor</b> oil leaves. A noticeable decrement was detected in the amino acid level of larvae fed on okra leaves followed by more decrement in larvae fed on tomato leaves...|$|R

The absorptive capacity, in terms of approximate digestibility, was significantly decreased at the sixth instar. The food utilization efficiencies, {{in terms of the}} conversion of ingested and digested food (ECD) to biomass, were significantly decreased at both fourth and fifth instars.

40|$|Eri silk {{is a fine}} quality silk {{obtained}} from the silkworms <b>reared</b> on <b>castor</b> leaves. It comprises of about 8 % of the total silk produced in India. It is produced as almost a household activity {{in certain parts of}} North-eastern India. The sericulture activities generate huge quantities of the waste silkworm pupae after production of the silk from cocoons. The dumping of this huge waste poses a threat to the environment of the locality. Recent studies have shown that these waste pupae contain 30 % or more lipid. The lipid part of the waste eri silkworm pupae can be transesterified with methanol to produce methyl esters of fatty acids. The present study reports a quick and efficient transesterification method to convert the lipid to fatty acid methyl ester. The physicochemical properties of the methyl ester are reported. The parameters fulfill the international requirement for biodiesel. Thus the present work shows that this bio-waste can be converted to good quality fuels which may be used as biodiesel additives...|$|R
40|$|The predatory mite, Neoseiulus californicus(McGregor, 1954) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) {{is one of}} the {{principal}} natural enemies of tetranychid mites in several countries, promoting efficient control of those mites in several food and ornamental crops. Pest attacks such as that of the spider mite, Tetranychus urticaeKoch, 1836 (Acari: Tetranychidae), {{is one of the}} problems faced by farmers, especially in the greenhouse, due to the difficulty of its control with the use of chemicals because of the development of fast resistance making it hard to control it. The objective of this work was to study the life history of the predatory mite N. californicus as a contribution to its mass laboratory <b>rearing,</b> having <b>castor</b> bean plant [Ricinus communis L. (Euphorbiaceae) ] pollen as food, for its subsequent use as a natural enemy of T. urticae on a cultivation of greenhouse rosebushes. The studies were carried out in the laboratory, at 25 ± 2 °C of temperature, 70 ± 10 % RH and a 14 hour photophase. The biological aspects and the fertility life table were appraised. Longevity of 32. 9 days was verified for adult females and 40. 4 days for males. The intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was 0. 2 and the mean generation time (T) was 17. 2 days. The population doubled every 4. 1 days. The results obtained were similar to those in which the predatory mite N. californicus fed on T. urticae...|$|R
