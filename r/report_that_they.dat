5|$|While {{any large}} shark {{is capable of}} inflicting injury and thus merits respect, the common {{thresher}} poses little danger to humans. Most divers <b>report</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are shy and difficult to approach underwater. The International Shark Attack File lists a single provoked attack by the thresher shark and four attacks on boats, which were probably incidental from individuals fighting capture. There is an unsubstantiated report of a common thresher acting aggressively towards a spearfisherman off New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Among the runestones of the Viking Age, 9.1–10% <b>report</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were raised}} in memory of people who went abroad, and the runestones that mention Greece {{constitute}} {{the largest group of}} them. In addition, there is a group of three or four runestones that commemorate men who died in southern Italy, and who were probably members of the Varangian Guard. The only group of stones comparable in number to the Greece runestones are those that mention England, followed by the c. 26 Ingvar runestones raised {{in the wake of the}} fateful Ingvar expedition to Persia.|$|E

5|$|While the {{individual}} diver cannot predict exactly at what depth {{the onset of}} narcosis will occur on a given day, the first symptoms of narcosis for any given diver are often more predictable and personal. For example, one diver may have trouble with eye focus (close accommodation for middle-aged divers), another may experience feelings of euphoria, and another feelings of claustrophobia. Some divers <b>report</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have hearing changes, and that the sound their exhaled bubbles make becomes different. Specialist training may help divers to identify these personal onset signs, which may then {{be used as a}} signal to ascend to avoid the narcosis, although severe narcosis may interfere with the judgement necessary to take preventive action.|$|E

The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to <b>report</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had not heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with}} a U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E

5|$|Most beekeepers {{affected}} by CCD <b>report</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> use antibiotics and miticides in their colonies, though {{the lack of}} uniformity as to which particular chemicals they use makes it unlikely that any single such chemical is involved. However, {{it is possible that}} not all such chemicals in use have been tested for possible effects on honey bees, and could therefore potentially be contributing to the CCD phenomenon. Beekeepers use miticides to rid colonies of Varroa infestations; however, treatment can lead to higher levels of viral infections in colonies. High doses of treatment or the use of miticides {{for an extended period of}} time can lead to immune-suppression in honey bees, making them more susceptible to viruses. A widespread occurrence of viral infections within a beehive can lead to colony collapse. Although miticides are not a direct cause of CCD they do play a role in it.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 Depression {{is one of}} {{the most}} debilitating, {{widespread}} and costly health problems worldwide and has a high prevalence in almost every society. Research suggests that depression affects an individual‟s work engagement levels, burnout levels and the occurrence of stress-related ill health symptoms. However, it is unclear whether these findings would differ among individuals who <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> suffer from depression and receive medical treatment for it, individuals who <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are unsure whether they suffer from depression, and individuals who <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not suffer from depression. This study is quantitative in nature and a cross-sectional design was used. The study population consisted of 15 664 participants from several sectors in South Africa. The participants also differed in terms of gender, age, race, marital status, educational level, language and the province where they reside. The sample population was thus representative of the diverse population of South Africa. The SAEHWS, a self-report instrument based on the dual-process model of work-related well-being, was used to measure all constructs. The participants were divided into three groups, i. e. individuals who <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> suffer from depression and are currently receiving medical treatment for depression, individuals who <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are uncertain whether they suffer from depression, and individuals who <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not suffer from depression. Frequencies were used to determine the prevalence of depression in the three different groups and MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) was used to determine the significance of differences between the levels of work engagement, burnout and stress-related ill health symptoms of the three different groups (individuals who <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> suffer from depression, individuals who <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are uncertain whether they suffer from depression, and those who <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not suffer from depression). The results showed that 18, 3 % of the population <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> suffer from depression and receive medical treatment for depression, 16, 7 % of the population <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are unsure whether they suffer from depression and 65 % <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not suffer from depression. Furthermore, it was found that depression significantly influences work engagement levels negatively and that it significantly influences burnout levels and the occurrence of stress-related ill health symptoms positively. This study will make organisations aware of the effect of depression on an individual‟s well-being and of the fact that depression is a factor to be reckoned with. Employers should consider ways to assist employees who suffer from depression and should learn how to act preventatively to decrease any further occurrence. Master...|$|R

40|$|The {{nutritional}} needs increase in puberty due to rapid growth {{and changes in}} body composition. Because of that healthy eating is vital for teen&# 146;s health. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine eating habits and weight control behaviors of high school students. A cross-sectional study was performed involving all (6 public and 3 private) tenth-grade high schools in Manisa city. Two thousand one hundred forty six students completed a questionnaire which consists of 26 items and was designed by researchers. Among all students surveyed, 34. 0 % <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> don&# 146;t have a habit to eat breakfast regularly, 38. 3 % <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> don&# 146;t have a habit to eat lunch regularly, 6. 5 % <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> don&# 146;t have a habit to eat dinner regularly, 36. 7 % <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were afraid getting fat, 6. 5 % <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were dieting, 39. 4 % <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> don&# 146;t make sport regularly and 59. 1 % <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were snacking frequently.
