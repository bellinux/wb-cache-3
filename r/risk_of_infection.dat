40|$|Introduction: TNF-α is a pro-inflammatory {{cytokine}} {{known to}} a {{have a key}} role in the pathogenesis of chronic immune-mediated diseases. TNF-α inhibitors can be administered either as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-inflammatory or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to treat chronic immune-mediated diseases. Areas covered: Patients receiving TNF-α inhibitors are at high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>infections.</b> Based on our experience, in this paper, we discuss the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> associated with the administration of TNF-α inhibitors and the strategies for mitigating against the development of these serious adverse events. Expert opinion: Infliximab more so than etanercept appears to be responsible for the increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>infections.</b> Re-activation <b>of</b> latent tuberculosis (LTB) infection and the overall <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> opportunistic <b>infections</b> should be considered before beginning TNF-α inhibitor therapy. A careful medical history, Mantoux test and chest-x-ray should always be performed before prescribing TNF-α inhibitors. Particular attention should be paid to risk factors for Pneumocystis jirovecii infection. Hepatitis B and C virological follow-up should be considered during TNF-α inhibitor treatment. Finally, patients who are at high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> herpes zoster (HZ) reactivation would benefit from a second vaccination in adulthood when receiving TNF-α inhibitors...|$|R
5|$|Those at high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> {{should be}} tested as there is {{effective}} treatment {{for those who have}} the disease. Groups that screening is recommended for include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following: people from areas of the world where hepatitis B occurs in more than 2%, those with HIV, intravenous drug users, {{men who have sex with}} men, and those who live with someone with hepatitis B.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developed}} world Campylobacter jejuni is {{the primary cause of}} bacterial gastroenteritis, with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry. In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species. If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for a period of several hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> in those who consume the food. Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and fruit and vegetable juices. In the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, cholera is a common cause of gastroenteritis. This infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} virus is {{typically}} transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols), {{direct contact with}} infected nasal secretions, or fomites (contaminated objects). Which of these routes is of primary importance has not been determined; however, hand-to-hand and hand-to-surface-to-hand contact seems of more importance than transmission via aerosols. The viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment (over 18 hours for rhinoviruses) and can {{be picked up by}} people's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs. Transmission is common in daycare and at school due to the proximity of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene. These infections are then brought home to other members of the family. There is no evidence that recirculated air during commercial flight is a method of transmission. People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E
50|$|Surgically created {{arteriovenous}} fistulas are preferred over catheters {{for patients}} with chronic renal failure, as the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> (e.g. endocarditis, bacteremia), hospitalization and death are lower.|$|R

5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E

5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E
5|$|Infection, {{bacterial}} or viral, {{particularly from}} Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococcus and Pseudomonas spp. Reports at the 16th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in 2006 indicated that bacterial infections are seldom serious, but that ten to {{twenty percent of}} piercings result in local benign bacterial infection. The Mayo Clinic estimates 30%. <b>Risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> is greatest among those with congenital heart disease, who have a much higher chance of developing life-threatening infective endocarditis, hemophiliacs and diabetics, {{as well as those}} taking corticosteroids. In 2006, a diabetic woman in Indiana lost a breast due to an infection from a nipple piercing. Viral infections may include hepatitis B, hepatitis C and, potentially, HIV, although as of 2009 there had been no documented cases of HIV caused by piercing. While rare, infection due to piercing of the tongue can be fatal. Higher prevalence of colonization of Candida albicans was reported in young individuals with tongue piercing, in comparison to non-tongue-pierced matched individuals.|$|E

40|$|Background: The HIV {{infection}} among {{adult male}} {{is high in}} Nepal. The chances <b>of</b> HIV <b>infection</b> from heterosexual route and infecting close partners are high due to their risky sexual behaviors. This study aimed to assess the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> HIV <b>Infection</b> and <b>risk</b> factors associated with high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> HIV <b>infection</b> among adult male in Nepal. Methodology: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted from the data of Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2011. Out of 4121 adult men aged between (15 - 49) years interviewed in the survey, 2837 who {{had at least one}} sexual experience was included in the study. The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> HIV <b>infection</b> was calculated using two sexual risk behaviors; multiple sex partners in last 12 months and condom used in last sexual intercourse. The univariate and multivariate analysis was done to assess the factors associated with high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> HIV <b>infection.</b> Results: About 4 % of adult male have high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> HIV <b>infection</b> in Nepal. The high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> HIV <b>infection</b> was significantly associated with young age, middle wealth class, having paid for sex and being sexually active in last 4 weeks preceding the survey.
