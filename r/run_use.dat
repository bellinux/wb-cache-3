5000|$|The Northwestern University Multislice and Imaging System (NUMIS) is {{a package}} is written by Professor Laurence Marks of Northwestern University. It uses a command line {{interface}} (CLI) and is based in UNIX. A structure file must be provided as input in order to <b>run</b> <b>use</b> this code, which makes it ideal for advanced users. The NUMIS multislice programs use the conventional multislice algorithm by calculating the wavefunction of electrons {{at the bottom of}} a crystal and simulating the image taking into account various instrument-specific parameters including [...] and convergence. This program is good to use if one already has structure files for a material that have been used in other calculations (for example, Density Functional Theory). These structure files can be used to general X-Ray structure factors which are then used as input for the PTBV routine in NUMIS. Microscope parameters can be changed through the MICROVB routine.|$|E
50|$|Augmentation, inoculative {{release and}} inundative release are {{different}} methods of biological control {{that affect the}} target pest in different ways. Augmentative control includes the periodic introduction of predators. With inundative release, predators are collected, mass-reared and periodically released in large numbers into the pest area. This is used for an immediate reduction in host populations, generally for annual crops, but is not suitable for long <b>run</b> <b>use.</b> With inoculative release {{a limited number of}} beneficial organisms are introduced {{at the start of the}} growing season. This strategy offers long term control as the organism's progeny affect pest populations throughout the season and is common in orchards. With seasonal inoculative release the beneficials are collected, mass-reared and released seasonally to maintain the beneficial population. This is commonly used in greenhouses. In America and other western countries, inundative releases are predominant, while Asia and the eastern Europe more commonly use inoculation and occasional introductions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated approach of simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA) for the analogue module placement in mixed-signal integrated circuit layout designs. The proposed algorithm follows the optimization flow {{of a normal}} GA controlled by the methodology of SA. The bit-matrix chromosomal representation is employed to describe the location and the orientation of modules. Compared with the conventional bit-string representation, the proposed chromosomal representation tends to significantly improve the search efficiency. In addition, a slide-based flat scheme is developed to transform an absolute co-ordinate placement of modules to a relative placement. In this way, the symmetry constraints imposed on analogue very large scale integration circuits can be easily fulfilled in the placement <b>run.</b> <b>Use</b> of a radiation-decoder can also drastically shrink the configuration space without degrading search opportunities. The proposed algorithm has been tested with several example circuits. The experiments show this promising algorithm makes the better performance than the simpler SA or GA approaches working alone, {{and the quality of}} the automatically generated layouts is comparable to those done manually...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} our recent efforts {{in the area of}} palladium- and nickel-catalysed aromatic substitution reactions. Main focus is on low cost and low waste production methods. The use of aromatic carboxylic anhydrides in the Heck reaction leads to a waste-free protocol. In addition these reactions are easy to work up as no ligands or bases are used. For Heck reactions where substrates or products do not tolerate high temperatures we found that use of a bulky phosphoramidite as ligand for palladium leads to a very fast reaction at low temperatures. Recycle of palladium in ligand-free Heck and Suzuki reactions is easily accomplished by treating the palladium black that precipitates {{at the end of the}} reaction on a carrier material with a small excess of I 2 prior to its re-use in the next <b>run.</b> <b>Use</b> of aryl chlorides in the palladium- and nickel-catalysed formation of biaryls can be accomplished by using the nickel-catalysed coupling with arylzinc chlorides. Better still, it was possible to make use of the arylgrignard and use a catalytic amount of ZnCl 2. Whereas the strength of these aromatic substitution reactions lies in their broad tolerance of functional groups, one exception was the Sonogashira reaction on 3 -bromoaniline. The problem was solved by making use of in situ catalytic protection of the NH 2 group with benzaldehyde. ...|$|E

Yet, difficulties in speech production {{have been shown}} to impact the intelligibility of these children. The goal {{of this study is to}} understand the effect of long-term use of cochlear implant on speech production, and more precisely on the coordination of laryngeal-oral gestures in stop production. The participants were all monolingual French children: 13 6; 6 - to 10; 7 -year-old CI children and 20 age-matched normally hearing (NH) children. We compared /p/, /t/, /k/, /b/, /d/ and /g/ in word-initial consonant-vowel sequences, produced in isolation in two different tasks, and we studied the effects of CI use, vowel context, task and age factors (i. e. chronological age, age at implantation and duration of implant use). Statistical analyses show a difference in voicing production between groups for voiceless consonants (shorter Voice Onset Times for CI children), with significance reached only for /k/, but no difference for voiced consonants. Our study indicates that in the long <b>run,</b> <b>use</b> of CI seems to have limited effects on the acquisition of oro-laryngeal coordination needed to produce voicing, except for specific difficulties located on velars. In a follow-up study, further acoustic analyses on vowel and fricative production by the same children reveal more difficulties, which suggest that cochlear implantation impacts frequency-based features (second formant of vowels and spectral moments of fricatives) more than durational cues (voicing) ...|$|E

40|$|To {{decrease}} dioxin uptake by {{the general}} population the European Union (EU) has set limits to the dioxin content of many foodstuffs including eggs. Eggs from free foraging chickens {{are known to have}} a higher dioxin content as compared to confined laying hens and it is the question whether these eggs can adhere to current EU regulations. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate parameters that are involved in the contamination of eggs from chickens raised under “organic” conditions. Samples from 34 organic farms including soil and earth worm samples were collected between September and December of the year 2003. Dioxin levels were assayed by GC/MS. Various parameters were collected by on farm interviews. Egg dioxin content varied between 0. 4 and 8. 1 pg Toxic Equivalents (TEQ) /g egg fat with a mean of 2. 2 pg TEQ/g egg fat. Nine out of 34 farms exceeded the EU limit of 3 pg TEQ/g egg fat. In addition dioxin-like (dl) PCBs were measured and 8 samples exceeded the limit for the sum of dioxins and dl-PCBs. Overall, egg samples from 10 farms were non-compliant with either the dioxin or total TEQ limits. No statistically significant relation could be observed between egg dioxin levels and the concentration observed in soil or earth worms. A statistically significant association was observed between flock size and egg dioxin and dl-PCB content. This effect is most likely attributable to the fact that flock size is related to the time chickens spend outside. Restricting outdoor <b>run</b> <b>use</b> on one of the farms resulted in a decrease of the egg dioxin content to a level that was within the EU limits. This demonstrates that the most likely contamination source is the soil or soil organisms but that the behaviour of the hens determines the extent of the contamination. Following the completion of this study, a dioxin monitoring protocol has been set up in The Netherlands to prevent marketing of eggs with raised dioxin levels. ...|$|E
