At first it introduces the novel non-von Neumann architecture of the Xputer, its need for efficient address generation and the basic structure of the Generic Address Generator. After a short introduction to Verilog, we discuss the problems with this hardware description language and show how to get around using some design restrictions. At the end a outlook on testing and simulation possibilities is given. Many applications require the same data manipulations to be performed on a large amount of data. These so called generic algorithms (e. g. systolic algorithms) are normally described as nested loops. A conventional von Neumann computer is not able to optimize such loops. <b>Repetitive</b> <b>address</b> patterns and data manipulations are interpreted on a per instruction basis. Thu...|$|R

50|$|On a PlayFirst's blog post, {{the founder}} and lead {{designer}} of KatGames, Miguel Tartaj described some new puzzle features in The Chosen Child. When KatGames started designing the puzzles for The Chosen Child, they wanted to focus on having the player experiment and interact with the scenes {{a lot more than}} in the previous Dream Chronicles games. There were a few puzzles in Dream Chronicles 2: The Eternal Maze where all the player was required to do was collect a lot of items from the scene and put them back where they belonged. While this is still fun, it can get <b>repetitive.</b> To <b>address</b> this, they invented some elaborate and magical devices for The Chosen Child where the player has to focus more carefully on figuring out the right items to collect and the proper combination in which to use them.|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} 2 ̆ 2 Mass and Repetitive Litigation in the Federal Courts 2 ̆ 2 {{is even more}} vast and {{unwieldy}} than the complex litigations it brings to mind. The implicit assignment to address the topic by contemplating the events that may occur over the next century is still more daunting. One hundred years bring untellable changes {{to all of our}} social and political institutions, judicial and otherwise. Rather than attempt to meet the challenge by uttering bold prophecies of the circumstances that will confront our successors of the future, I will follow an easier course. This paper will select a few illustrations of mass and <b>repetitive</b> litigation and <b>address</b> them from the perspectives generated by smaller, more familiar, but nonetheless difficult problems of simple litigation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-This paper {{presents}} {{a framework of}} tempos and rhythms to clarify the relevance between psychological states and facial expressions, particularly <b>addressing</b> <b>repetitive</b> operations of intentional facial expressions after giving a stress stimulus. By acquiring image datasets of facial expressions under the states of pleasant–unpleasant stimulus for 20 subjects, we extracted expressive tempos for respective subjects. Consequently, averages of extraction rates show that the pleasant state was 81. 1 %. The unpleasant state was 77. 8 %. Regarding effects of pleasant–unpleasant stimulus on the expressive tempos, particularly addressing the variation {{of the number of}} frames constituting one tempo, the variation in unpleasant stimulus became greater than that in the pleasant stimulus. The results show that the analysis using expressive tempos and rhythms is valid as an indicator for estimating the psychological state.

40|$|This paper reviews 40 serious games {{designed}} {{for children with}} autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and these games/studies are classified into four categories; technology platform, computer graphics, gaming aspect and user interaction. Moreover, the paper discusses serious games {{designed for}} the improvement of communication skills and social behavior, social conversation, imaginative skills, sensory integration and learning accounts in ASD children. The children usually interact with these games by ordinary IO (input/output) e. g. keyboard and mouse or touchscreen tools. Previous researches show the effectiveness of playing serious games on mobiles or tablet devices in helping ASD children to express their feelings and improve the level of engagement with others. However, there are limitations in designing games for helping autistic children with sensory processing disorder (SPD), improving imaginative play, and teaching first aid. Further, there is not much research that <b>addresses</b> <b>repetitive</b> behavior in ASD children...|$|R
40|$|Assuming {{that the}} image {{distortion}} between corresponding regions of a stereo pair of images with wide baseline can be approximated as an affine transformation if the regions are reasonably small, recent image matching algorithms have focused on affine invariant region (IR) detection and its description to increase the robustness in matching. However, the distinctiveness of an intensity-based region descriptor tends to deteriorate when an image includes homogeneous texture or <b>repetitive</b> pattern. To <b>address</b> this problem, we investigated the geometry of a local IR cluster (also called a clique) and propose a new clique-based image matching method. In the proposed method, the clique of an IR is estimated by Delaunay triangulation in a local affine frame and the Hausdorff distance is adopted for matching an inexact number of multiple descriptor vectors. We also introduce two adaptively weighted clique distances, where the neighbour distance in a clique is appropriately weighted according to characteristics of the local feature distribution. Experimental results show the clique-based matching method produces more tentative correspondences than variants of the SIFT-based method...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedCurrent Marine Corps policy requires that all Marines below {{the rank of}} Gunnery Sergeant and with fewer than 13 years of service undergo annual rifle qualification. Annual marksmanship training is <b>repetitive</b> and only <b>addresses</b> the fundamentals of marksmanship, which Marines typically master in their first few years. Key features of marksmanship training are instilled at initial training for officers and enlisted Marines, but advanced training is seldom received outside infantry and select occupational fields. Operational tempo or limited range availability may also {{make it impossible for}} some Marines (or entire units) to attend. Analysis of all recorded marksmanship scores from the past 20 years shows no significant changes in proficiency for Marines continuing to conduct sustainment under the current or previous policy. The current Marine Corps policy can be adjusted to increase the overall lethality of the force by recognizing earlier proficiencies with marksmanship skills and allowing Marines who have shown proficiency to advance to intermediate and advanced combat marksmanship training. The Marine Corps can refocus resources by conducting fewer sustainment-level rifle qualifications, allowing units to more efficiently schedule marksmanship training commensurate with the Marine’s level of proficiency.

40|$|Large {{blocks of}} DNA repeats are {{commonly}} assembled into heterochromatin. Heterochromatic regions impose a transcriptionally repressive environment that can propagate over long distances stochastically silencing native genes {{as well as}} reporter genes inserted at these regions independently of DNA sequence. Heterochromatin, associated with repressive histone marks, not only down-regulates transcription but also inhibits recombination at repetitive elements. This epigenetic regulation could be a key regulatory step in organisms, such as microbial pathogens, that have to adapt rapidly to different environments. Here for the first time, we analysed the chromatin state of C. albicans <b>repetitive</b> elements and <b>addressed</b> whether and how this epigenetic state controls C. albicans genome stability. The results show that classic SIR 2 -dependent heterochromatin is assembled at the rDNA and telomeres. Interestingly, heterochromatin at telomeres is plastic and remodelled upon environmental changes. Pericentromeric regions and MRS (Mayor Repeated Sequences) are assembled into permissive chromatin bearing features of both heterochromatin and euchromatin. Surprisingly, SIR 2 -dependent heterochromatin does not control recombination at the rDNA. However, it inhibits recombination at the TRE (TLO Recombination Element) sequence associated with some TLO genes at subtelomeric regions. These results show that epigenetic factors promote differential genome stabitlity at different loci...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} many great {{advances}} {{in the field of}} education with regard to students with special needs, especially for those with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social and communication skills, as well as ritualistic and <b>repetitive</b> behavior. To <b>address</b> these core deficits, students with ASD may require supports on many levels in the school setting. Technology provides a new method {{to address the needs of}} those with ASD as well as other disabilities. The use of technology is a way to connect these individuals with their mainstream peers in the classroom and provides a more discrete way of allowing them to have the supports they need. As technological advances are being made, more of these technologies can be incorporated into classroom programs for students who require additional supports. In the 21 st century, technology is becoming increasingly integrated into human society. It is not uncommon to see individuals on iPads, tablets, laptops, and smart phones at home, work, and in public. Even individuals with ASD engage with electronic screen media more than they engage with any other leisure activity (Shane & Albert, 2008). Within this context, it is logical that researchers and educators should be lookin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLoops connect regular {{secondary}} structures. In many instances, {{they are}} known to play important biological roles. Analysis and prediction of loop conformations depend directly on the definition of repetitive structures. Nonetheless, the secondary structure assignment methods (SSAMs) often lead to divergent assignments. In this study, we analyzed, both structure and sequence point of views, how the divergence between different SSAMs affect boundary definitions of loops connecting regular secondary structures. The analysis of SSAMs underlines that no clear consensus between the different SSAMs can be easily found. Because these latter greatly influence the loop boundary definitions, important variations are indeed observed, that is, capping positions are shifted between different SSAMs. On the other hand, our {{results show that the}} sequence information in these capping regions are more stable than expected, and, classical and equivalent sequence patterns were found for most of the SSAMs. This is, to our knowledge, the most exhaustive survey in this field as (i) various databank have been used leading to similar results without implication of protein redundancy and (ii) the first time various SSAMs have been used. This work hence gives new insights into the difficult question of assignment of <b>repetitive</b> structures and <b>addresses</b> the issue of loop boundaries definition. Although SSAMs give very different local structure assignments capping sequence patterns remain efficiently stable...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: There {{have been}} few reports on the {{prognosis}} of patients with intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct (IPNB). Here we report a case of IPNB in a patient with early-stage carcinoma who had multicentric recurrence in the remnant hepatic bile duct after curative resection. Case presentation: A 78 -year-old man with hepatic dysfunction and cholestasis was referred to our hospital. Preoperative imaging studies revealed the presence of papillary tumors in the left hepatic duct and common hepatic duct, while no tumor lesions were detected in the right hepatic duct. This patient underwent left hepatectomy, extra-hepatic bile duct resection with biliary reconstruction, and regional lymphnode dissection. On the basis of pathological examination, this patient was diagnosed with multiple IPNB with early-stage adenocarcinoma with negative surgical margin. Postoperative work-up was periodically performed, indicating no evidence of recurrence, while the patient had sustained hepatic dysfunction, cholestasis, and repetitive cholangitis since the early postoperative period. Finally, recurrence in the remnant intrahepatic bile duct of the posterior segment was revealed by double balloon enteroscopy at 29 months after surgery. At 34 months after surgery, internal drainage stents were replaced in both endoscopic and percutaneous manners within the relapsed intrahepatic bile ducts to <b>address</b> <b>repetitive</b> cholangitis. These procedures enabled the patient to remain asymptomatic until death at 41 months after surgery. Discussion: Multicentric recurrence in the remnant intrahepatic bile duct after surgery may occur in IPNB patients with multiple lesions. An endoscopic approach may be useful in such cases, not only in the diagnosis of remnant intrahepatic bile duct recurrence but also for palliation of symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a {{lentivirus}} {{that causes}} Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) {{resulting in the}} progressive failure of the immune system. Due to its rapid replication rate and high mutation frequency, the virus is able to evade {{the immune system and}} thwart an efficacious response. Current HIV infection prophylaxes and therapeutics are not optimal and there is an urgent need to develop an efficacious HIV vaccine. Recently, high-throughput sequencing of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire from HIV-infected humans and immunized Rhesus macaques has led to important insights into vaccines against HIV- 1. Further elucidation of the antibody response in these crucial animal studies will require substantially greater power to analyze the Ig repertoires than is currently possible. Reliable information on macaque Ig genes is insufficient due to the incompleteness of the whole genome sequence (WGS) and the inherent difficulty of obtaining complete Ig sequences due to its complex and <b>repetitive</b> nature. To <b>address</b> this issue, we have generated a high quality, annotated WGS with precisely annotated Ig loci from ten macaques. We used low error, synthetic long reads generated by Illumina TruSeq technology, Illumina 150 bp, paired-end reads (110 X coverage) and Irys genome mapping technology to assemble the genome de novo. We employed a bait-and-sequence strategy using human Ig probes to capture macaque Ig genes for the accurate assembly and annotation of Ig genes and alleles. Together, these data will generate a complete Rhesus macaque genome with detailed information on allelic diversity at the Ig loci. This study is essential for making the macaque a viable model for adaptive immunity. In addition, it will provide information on the similarities and differences between macaque and human Ig genes that will aid in the design and interpretation of vaccine studies...|$|R
