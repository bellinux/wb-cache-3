5|$|Command & Conquer {{requires}} the player {{to construct a}} base and to gather resources in order to fund the production of buildings, technologies, and combat units to attack and conquer an opponent's base. The game contains two playable factions: the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod. GDI units are sturdy and powerful, but expensive. Meanwhile, Nod armies {{are made up of}} a mix of cheap and numerous units, mixed in with unusual units such as rocket bikes and stealth tanks. As a result, GDI focuses on large-scale strategic attacks, while Nod creates bigger armies and uses unconventional tactics. There are roughly fifty units and structures in total. Tiberium, the game's sole <b>resource,</b> <b>is</b> gathered by harvester units that carry it to a refinery structure for processing. When the player constructs buildings, additional units and structures become available for purchase. Command & Conquer features two single-player campaigns, one each for the GDI and Nod factions. The objective of most campaign missions is to destroy or take control of enemy buildings. The missions begin with live-action full motion video (FMV) cutscenes.|$|E
5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> worthy of preservation.|$|E

25|$|Both Chicken and Hawk–Dove are anti-coordination games, {{in which}} it is {{mutually}} beneficial for the players to play different strategies. In this way, it {{can be thought of as}} the opposite of a coordination game, where playing the same strategy Pareto dominates playing different strategies. The underlying concept is that players use a shared resource. In coordination games, sharing the resource creates a benefit for all: the <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> non-rivalrous, and the shared usage creates positive externalities. In anti-coordination games the <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> rivalrous but non-excludable and sharing comes at a cost (or negative externality).|$|E

To the object manager, each <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> an object, whether that <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> a physical resource (such as a file system or peripheral) or a logical resource (such as a file).

25|$|The metaphor {{illustrates}} {{the argument that}} free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through over-exploitation, temporarily or permanently. This occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups, each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it, while {{the costs of the}} exploitation are borne by all those to whom the <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> available (which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it). This, in turn, causes demand for the resource to increase, which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses (even if it retains a capacity to recover). The rate at which depletion of the <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> realized depends primarily on three factors: the number of users wanting to consume the common in question, the consumptiveness of their uses, and the relative robustness of the common.|$|E

25|$|Another factor {{important}} to consider {{in the understanding of}} the fishery's collapse is the uncertainty inherent in the assessment of the cod as a resource. Management of a <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> an extremely complex task, with a multitude of interests, perspectives, and sources of information to take into account; when knowledge regarding the <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> limited, or clouded by imprecision, the task of managing it becomes even more difficult. The management of fisheries are associated with an especially high degree of uncertainty due to problems inherent {{in the nature of the}} resource. Newfoundland's cod fisheries were no exception: an imperfect understanding of the ocean ecosystem; technical and environmental challenges associated with observation techniques, which led to incomplete data on the resource (the cod); and the naturally high levels of variability in the population due to dynamic environmental factors (such as ocean temperature) combined to make the discernment of the effects of exploitation an arduous task. Unfortunately, this led to predictions about the condition and future of the cod stock that were mired in uncertainty, making it more difficult for the government to choose the appropriate course of action.|$|E
