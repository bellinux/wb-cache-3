25|$|The cyclic <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> (CRC) {{is based}} on {{division}} in the ring of polynomials over the finite field GF(2) (the integers modulo 2), that is, the set of polynomials where each coefficient is either zero or one, and arithmetic operations wrap around.|$|E
25|$|In {{the high}} {{definition}} {{serial digital interface}} (and in dual-link HD), additional check words are provided to increase the robustness of the interface. In these formats, the four samples immediately following the EAV packets (but not the SAV packets) contain a cyclic <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> field, and a line count indicator. The CRC field provides a CRC of the preceding line (CRCs are computed independently for the Y and C streams), {{and can be used}} to detect bit errors in the interface. The line count field indicates the line number of the current line.|$|E

25|$|A blank {{unformatted}} diskette has a {{coating of}} magnetic oxide with no magnetic {{order to the}} particles. During formatting, the magnetizations of the particles are aligned forming tracks, each broken up into sectors, enabling the controller to properly read and write data. The tracks are concentric rings around the center, with spaces between tracks where no data is written; gaps with padding bytes are provided between the sectors {{and at the end}} of the track to allow for slight speed variations in the disk drive, and to permit better interoperability with disk drives connected to other similar systems. Each sector of data has a header that identifies the sector location on the disk. A cyclic <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> (CRC) is written into the sector headers {{and at the end of}} the user data so that the disk controller can detect potential errors. Some errors are soft and can be resolved by automatically re-trying the read operation; other errors are permanent and the disk controller will signal a failure to the operating system if multiple attempts to read the data still fail.|$|E

50|$|In telecommunications, a {{transverse}} <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> (TRC) or vertical <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> is a <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> for synchronized parallel bits applied {{once per}} bit time, across the bit streams. This requires additional parallel channels for the check bit or bits.|$|E

50|$|In telecommunication, a {{longitudinal}} <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> (LRC), or horizontal <b>redundancy</b> <b>check,</b> {{is a form}} of <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> that is applied independently to each of a parallel group of bit streams. The data must be divided into transmission blocks, to which the additional check data is added.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "parity track" [...] {{was present}} on the first {{magnetic}} tape data storage in 1951. Parity in this form, applied across multiple parallel signals, {{is known as a}} transverse <b>redundancy</b> <b>check.</b> This can be combined with parity computed over multiple bits sent on a single signal, a longitudinal <b>redundancy</b> <b>check.</b> In a parallel bus, there is one longitudinal <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> bit per parallel signal.|$|E

50|$|There {{exists a}} vast variety of {{different}} hash function designs. However, some are of particularly widespread use because of either their simplicity or their suitability for detecting certain kinds of errors (e.g., the cyclic <b>redundancy</b> <b>check's</b> performance in detecting burst errors).|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{firewall}} is {{a packet}} filter that is {{placed at the}} entrance of a private network. It checks the header fields of each incoming packet into the private network and decides, based on the specified rules in the firewall, whether to accept the packet and allow it to proceed or to discard the packet. To validate the correctness and effectiveness of the rules in a firewall, the firewall rules are usually subjected to two types of analysis: verification and <b>redundancy</b> <b>checking.</b> Verification is used to verify that the rules in a firewall accept all packets that should be accepted and discard all packets that should be discarded. <b>Redundancy</b> <b>checking</b> is used to check that no rule in a firewall is redundant (i. e. can be removed from the firewall without changing the sets of packets accepted and discarded by the firewall). In this paper we show that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, these two types of analysis are in fact equivalent. In particular, we show that (1) every verification algorithm can be also used to check whether a rule in a firewall is redundant, and (2) every <b>redundancy</b> <b>checking</b> algorithm can be also used to verify whether the rules in a firewall accept or discard an intended set of packets.

50|$|Typically the {{transmitter}} adds a <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> number {{to the end}} of each frame. The receiver uses the <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> number to check for possible damage.
