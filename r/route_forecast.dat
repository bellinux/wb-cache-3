40|$|Abstract Thunderstorms {{can often}} result in {{direct threat to}} life and {{property}} when associated with heavy rain, hail, gusting wind and lightning. However, these events have received limited attention from a forecaster's and climatologist's {{point of view in}} Saudi Arabia. Meteorological research in Saudi Arabia has very limited; lack of data places severe restrictions on such work. The purpose of this research is to achieve a better understanding of thunderstorm formation in Saudi Arabia, advancing the understanding of the atmospheric processes that influence the initiation of storms and how they evolve over different types of terrain in Saudi Arabia; with the new datasets available now, this aim is possible. This study also aims to provide useful information on thunderstorm distribution and prediction to the local forecasters in Saudi Arabia to improve forecasting methods for all seasons. It was found that the study area presents many challenging meteorological problems. The synoptic climate has not previously been well documented and thereafter, it is poorly understood. Thus, this study provides, for the first time, a long term (44 -year) synoptic climatology in Saudi Arabia based on ECMWF (ERA- 40 reanalysis and operational) datasets. No thunderstorm climatology currently exists for Saudi Arabia; it is difficult to capture the high temporal/spatial variability of thunderstorms in Saudi Arabia due to lack of observation network coverage. Thus, this study has to include elements including satellite based data. By utilizing data from satellite-borne lightning detectors, is now possible to learn about thunderstorm distribution, especially in places where no enough surface stations such as Saudi Arabia. Reports of thunderstorms using surface observational data in Saudi Arabia are compared here with satellite based lightning data from the Lightning Imager Sensor (LIS) onboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite and with satellite based Outgoing Long-wave Radiation data, with strong agreement being found between them. Analysis of these data shows seasonal variability between various geographic regions. Although both frontal and air mass thunderstorms occur in Saudi Arabia spring months are characterized by particularly frequent thunderstorm activity in the kingdom. Furthermore, both LIS and OLR show, {{for the first time the}} distribution of lightning flashes over the central and southern Red Sea and over the Arabian Gulf where no observational stations. Thus, LIS and OLR can compensate the lack and fill in the gab of surface observations in Saudi Arabia. These results will help in flight <b>route</b> <b>forecast</b> in the future. The anomaly field on heavy thunderstorm days and on dry days was investigated to address the synoptic differences between dry and heavy thunderstorm days. The results highlighted the importance of number of key drives: surface disturbances, upper tropospheric mechanisms, sea breezes and instability due primarily to high insolation over the area. Severe thunderstorm occurrences in Saudi Arabia are associated with various types of weather systems, but synoptic typing in Saudi Arabia has not until now been carried out. Based on daily MSLP at 1200 UTC, analyses of the synoptic situations accompanying heavy thunderstorms using, for the first time, a hybrid classification scheme combining subjective and objective methods showed that seven synoptic types are favourable for heavy thunderstorms formation. These patterns are: The Red Sea trough, the Red Sea trough combined with the Saudi low, the Middle East low, The Saudi low, the Mediterranean low, the Sudan trough combined with the Sahara low and the Indian monsoon trough. A comparison of subjective and objective classifications revealed that the classifications into these seven types match on more than half (52 %) of the days, while 48 % of the days were unclassified because of the subjectivity of manual classification. Local conditions determining spatial differentiation of thunderstorm occurrence in Saudi Arabia were also taken into consideration. Modelling work concerning meteorological issues is severely limited in Saudi Arabia. In this study the PSUINCAR MM 5 model was adopted, for the first time, to simulate heavy thunderstorm events associated with rainfall (less than or equal to 10 mm/day) to help simulate the synoptic and meso-scale environments conductive to heavy thunderstorm events in Saudi Arabia and understand their formation mechanisms. Three nested numerical experiments have been performed with grid resolutions of 135, 45, and 15 km. The spatial and temporal distribution of simulated heavy thunderstorms offered evidence linking to additional local effect factors such as terrain, high insolation leading to instability, low-level convergence zones, sea-land breezes and the interaction between flow and topography. Overall, this study presents information on the variability in thunderstorm occurrence in Saudi Arabia and pins-point favourable environmental and synoptic conditions, and the physical mechanisms of such phenomena in addition to numerical simulations of heavy thunderstorm events in Saudi Arabia.

We have previously reported on Stages 1 and 2. Stage 3 refinements are reported alongside those made in Stage 4 in this Deliverable. In Stage 1, we developed the <b>route</b> and passenger <b>forecasts</b> for 2015, for the UK regional airports. We produced passenger forecasts {{for the whole of}} the year 2015 (primarily based on 1995 and 2005 CAA-sourced data), and <b>route</b> and frequency <b>forecasts</b> which related to a peak week in July 2015 (primarily based on 1995 and 2005 OAG-sourced data), split into international, plus ‚Äòdomestic and Eire‚Äô forecasts. In Stage 2, we specified the actual <b>routes</b> <b>forecast</b> for all UK regional airports, for the peak week in July 2015. An example peak week schedule for Aberdeen was furnished. The schedules and forecasts have been built from a supporting database of over 10 500 flights. Several independent models were built, and integrated, to produce the initial output tables. Extensive data cleaning was necessary for this task. In Stages 3 and 4, a number of enhancements have been incorporated into the algorithms for the model, including the integration of some basic, alternative macro-level assumptions (such as higher/lower growth rates). New methods for the balancing of domestic routes and incorporation of different runway constraints are discussed. The challenges of producing parallel charter and cargo estimates are also explored. Seven pre-defined forecast scenarios that simulate varying degrees of economic growth and fuel price have been developed and form the basis of the output generated by the model. The baseline (scenario 1) forecast is discussed in detail in this Deliverable, and forms the basis of the outputs herein. In addition, output tables (traffic forecasts and timetables) for all seven scenarios accompany this document. Total CO 2, aggregated across all the scheduled passenger flight movements from the 36 regional forecasts have been calculated for each of the seven scenarios.

40|$|The Nordic Seas and the Barents Sea is the Atlantic Ocean‚Äôs {{gateway to}} the Arctic Ocean, and the Gulf Stream‚Äôs {{northern}} extension brings large amounts of heat into this region and modulates climate in northwestern Europe. We have investigated the predictive skill of initialized hindcast simulations performed with three state-of-the-art climate prediction models within the CMIP 5 -framework, focusing on sea surface temperature (SST) in the Nordic Seas and Barents Sea, but also on sea ice extent, and the subpolar North Atlantic upstream. The hindcasts are compared with observation-based SST for the period 1961 ‚Äì 2010. All models have significant predictive skill in specific regions at certain lead times. However, among the three models there is little consistency concerning which regions that display predictive skill and at what lead times. For instance, in the eastern Nordic Seas, only one model has significant skill in predicting observed SST variability at longer lead times (7 ‚Äì 10 years). This region is of particular promise in terms of predictability, as observed thermohaline anomalies progress from the subpolar North Atlantic to the Fram Strait within the time frame {{of a couple of}} years. In the same model, predictive skill appears to move northward along a similar <b>route</b> as <b>forecast</b> time progresses. We attribute this to the northward advection of SST anomalies, contributing to skill at longer lead times in the eastern Nordic Seas. The skill at these lead times in particular beats that of persistence forecast, again indicating the potential role of ocean circulation as a source for skill. Furthermore, we discuss possible explanations for the difference in skill among models, such as different model resolutions, initialization techniques, and model climatologies and variance. ¬© 2016 The Author(s...|$|R

Traffic flow management algorithms require reliable <b>forecasts</b> of <b>route</b> blockage to schedule and route traffic. This paper demonstrates how raw convective weather forecasts, which provide deterministic predictions of the vertically integrated liquid (the precipitation content in a column of airspace) can be translated into probabilistic forecasts {{of whether or not}} a terminal area route will be blocked.

40|$|Route {{planning}} {{forms an}} important aspect of airline operations for them to sustain the effects of deregulation and fierce competition. The Indian economic liberalization in 1991 has seen diminishing monopoly of Air India and dynamic demand splits amongst the service providers. Our research focuses on developing an aggregate <b>route</b> traffic demand <b>forecasting</b> (RTDF) model specifically for international carriers operating from India. The model is an econometric model that combines concepts of the traditional Gravity model of Physics and the Micro-economic theoretic model that links demand to price. In other words, the RTDF model is a fusion of the behavioral and gravity models. While developing the model, Becker‚Äôs approach of utility maximization has been made use of, thereby combining time and other inputs required to produce travel. The model is developed for the existing international routes from India with 2005 aggregative data provided by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which spanned 15 countries in Europe, Asia, Canada, and North America. The model has been validated and tested for its predictive power on a few intentionally left out routes from the original sample. The model explains about 70 % of the variance, which is well above the acceptable zone for cross-sectional data. The model is then estimated for 2007 data on a few randomly selected high demand routes; the prediction error ranging from a minimum of 3. 5 % to a maximum of 13 %, a range well within the acceptable error limits. We derive a sector-cost-model (SCM) by applying the concept of break-even analysis on the RTDF model. The SCM provides cost estimates on a particular route at various levels of airfare. The SCM helps us gain further insights into the business nature prevailing in the airline sector. On the viability of operations, we propose the sector-operation-fare (SOF) to be charged on a respective route, given the load factor, if the airline wishes to continue operations. For arriving at the SOF, we follow a demand oriented framework that comprises of two demand curves: the airline curve and the traffic curve. The numerical analyses provide room for policy formulations that help airlines in refining, redefining, and revitalizing the decision-making process in their operations. Airlines can use this model to forecast demand for a newly contemplated route and obtain a fair idea of the price they can charge the customer. In other words, airlines can estimate the economic viability of operations on a respective route...|$|R

The design and analysis of the feasibility of airlines networks can be done by using the models developed in this thesis. It is possible to identify routes that are opportunities to open services, based on airline operating costs, passenger demand, aircraft and airport capacities and constraints. The optimization model based on the maximization of the net present value (NPV) allows airlines to make sure that a set of routes and links forming new networks represent an investment. The different airline business models, strategies, advantages and disadvantages were identified from the literature review. In general, four generic passenger business models are commonly recognized: full service carriers (FSC‚Äôs), low cost carriers (LCC‚Äôs), charter airlines and regional airlines. In reality, each airline has its own business model. As a main conclusion, it is also possible to say that the low-cost long-haul airline business is not competitive against full-service long haul and charter airlines businesses. The fare is the most important parameter or variable. Airlines can use it as a tool to get into the market, and increase passenger flow. Other parameters that airlines must consider in a model or methodology that determine what routes to operate are the target market, network structure, size and power of the route network, optimum number of passengers to attend, aircraft utilization, aircraft physical characteristics, size of the fleet, aircraft route load factor, seat capacity, frequency, turnaround times and airport capacities and infrastructure. Two airline operating cost models were developed based on econometric and engineering approaches. Both models were compared with real data. They were found to be highly accurate to calculate airline and aircraft operating costs. First, the AGE model (Chapter 3) is the most suitable model {{for the purpose of this}} research because it differentiates between aircraft operating costs. The AGE model can calculate route aircraft operating costs per flight per aircraft. It is based on load and range and it is highly accurate to calculate the total jet fuel volume needed to fly a certain route link by any aircraft type. The AGE model was used to generate operating costs data in the studied cases of Chapter 7. The second model is a translog function (AOC model), also developed in Chapter 3. It most important advantage is the possibility to calculate different operating costs per route per pax. It allows studying each operating cost effect on fares. The AOC model represents some advantages analyzing airlines market behaviour such as airlines business models competition. The disadvantage is that it does not consider that different aircraft types have different costs. A model that determines the lowest possible average route fare was proposed in Chapter 4. The model purpose is to identify routes that could be an opportunity to open services. Calculating a route fare is an important managerial tool. Different parameters have been identified as possible airfare determinants based on the literature (Table 4. 2). Two mathematical models were developed in Chapter 4. Both models determine airline fares: the fare estimation model (FEM) model and the CFEM model methodology. The FEM model is a union between the AOC model (Chapter 3) and airport fees, social, economic and competitive factors. The statistic tests (ANOVA, t test and F test) confirm that the model can calculate fares and its variables have an influence on airline fares. In the case of a new airline, the FEM model can assume its operating cost factor by comparing with a similar airline business model because it is unknown. Although, the FEM model calculates airline routes fares highly accurate. The objective is to calculate the most convenient fare to identify routes where an airline can open new services. The FEM model can calculate the average route fare but not the range in between airlines route fares are expected to be. This is important, under competition airlines need to know how cheap the other airlines fares can be. Airlines can identify routes to open new service by knowing the other airlines possible min and max route fares. The CFEM model has been developed to calculate these ranges (Chapter 4). The CFEM model calculates the competitive fare using coefficients calibrated for the FSC-LCC market. In the case of an existing airline, this value needs to be compared with the FEM model average fare calculation. The comparison tells us if the CFEM model average fare calculation is possible. In the case of a new airline, the FEM model can calculate the operating cost factor needed to achieve the CFEM average fare value. Thus, both models complement each other. The CFEM methodology determines what routes represent an opportunity to open services by an airline based on the calculation of the most competitive fare. Nevertheless, it is not enough to find routes where the pax demand is high or good enough to open services. The forecast of the air pax demand is important for economic decisions of network planning, fleet assignment, new routes and investment. For those routes, it is very important to know if the induced demand is higher than the demand that is already transported by the other airlines operating the route before making the decisions of opening new services. In reality, the induced demand cannot be known. The induced demand estimation model (PEM) simulates the pax flow behaviour (Chapter 5) by describing the distribution of the pax flow behaviour using approximately 18, 000 routes data points. It was found that the log-normal distribution function (Equation 5. 6) is the function that describes the US Domestic market behaviour better. The database was divided into five different airports types depending on the total number of pax transported per day. The results confirmed that the pax flow can be simulated by the log-normal distribution function. The routes that represent an opportunity to open new services are selected using the next criteria. Routes where the actual number of pax flow is higher than the PEM model calculations do not represent an opportunity to open services. In these routes, it is believed that most of the demand is already being attended. On the other hand, routes where the actual number of pax flow is smaller than the PEM model calculations represent an opportunity to open services. In these routes, it is believed that part of the demand has not been attended. Even when one route has been selected by the CFEM and PEM models, it does not mean that they represent an opportunity to open services. The routes selection of an airline network have more constraints than just finding routes that are very expensive and have a high number of induced passenger demand. Aircraft and airport capacities, characteristics, and limitations are main constraints to consider when selecting routes that represent an opportunity to open services. Airlines have to make sure that their set of routes and the links forming their networks represent an investment. In this thesis, the optimization model integrates aircraft performances and airport capacities with two financial methods: net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR). The return on investment (ROI) is also used to compare which aircraft and network generates more benefits for their required investment. The ROI is not a constraint, and it is not part of the optimization model. The importance of calculating the ROI is analyzing the efficiency between aircraft after optimization. The maximization of an airline network net present value (NPV) requires forecasting the pax demand for future years. The NPV optimization model is presented in Chapter 6. In this thesis, a Grey model (GM) modified version has been used to <b>forecast</b> <b>routes</b> pax flow for the long-term. The GM model was selected because it has the capacity to forecast data that have unknown parameters and it requires few data to approximate the behaviour of unknown systems. In the model, frequency is affected by the pax perception of travelling. This value represents the pax willingness for travelling the link. The number of frequencies increases on a link if the perception value increases. It decreases if the perception value decreases. The number of frequencies is also related to the aircraft operating costs. Reason why, the frequency calculated minimizes operating costs per route link. The model can analyze two different airlines network (NTW) cases for each aircraft type. On one side, the model allows studying a network without links with negative profits. On the other side, allowing aircraft to operate links with negative profits is relevant because an airline can earn more money. The generation of both types of networks is important to compare if different sets of routes with a different set of links results into higher net present values. A route generation algorithm assigns a route number and a link number to each possible link previously selected by the CFEM and PEM model. The objective is to determine the aircraft path. The algorithm considers the elimination of those routes that do not break the flying path only when a route NPV is negative. This algorithm achieves two things. One, it increases the number of pax transported by the airline. All possible routes are considered for open services when the NPV of a route is positive. Two, the route will eliminate routes with negative profits to find the links that make it profitable, whilst flying the maximum possible number of connections. The generation algorithm does not generate all possible routes between the city/airports in an airline network by purpose. Then, it is possible that another combination, with less routes and links, has a higher NPV than the route generator best combination, but transporting less number of passengers. The objective of this thesis is to find routes that represent a good opportunity to open services and design airlines networks by maximizing the network NPV and the total number of passengers transported in the network. It means to provide service to most of the links selected by the CFEM and PEM model, if the NPV still suggesting a good investment. The model assigns the optimum aircraft type to each route in an airline network. The model also applied short-haul and long-haul strategies. It allows the model simulating short-haul and long-haul scenarios. The results indicated that direct flights carrying cargo are a better business than connecting passengers through hubs. It means that it is very difficult to create an airline company that operates long-haul low-cost networks. The long-haul low-cost model connecting LCC‚Äôs companies in different regions through hubs allows increasing airlines networks net present values. The cases studied in Chapter 7 have shown that carrying cargo is what allows long-haul airlines to earn more money, but this business is already operated by FSC‚Äôs and cargo companies. Finally, the cases studied in Chapter 7 show that there are not an ideal aircraft. It is possible to find the optimum aircraft for each network.
