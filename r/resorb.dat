5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, <b>resorb</b> their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At this point in time a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.|$|E

40|$|Patients with {{advanced}} breast cancer may develop acute, severe hypercalcemia when treated with estrogens or antiestrogens. In this study, {{we examined the}} effects of estrogens and related compounds on the release of bone <b>resorbing</b> activity by cultured human breast cancer cells in vitro. We found that the estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cell line MCF- 7 releases bone <b>resorbing</b> activity in response to low concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol. Bone <b>resorbing</b> activity was also released in response to the antiestrogen nafoxidine. Other steroidal compounds had no effect on the release of bone <b>resorbing</b> activity. Estrogen-stimulated release of bone <b>resorbing</b> activity occurred with live bone cultures, but not with devitalized bones, indicating that the effect was bone cell mediated. The breast cancer cell line MDA- 231, which does not have estrogen receptors, did not release bone <b>resorbing</b> activity in response to 17 beta-estradiol or nafoxidine. Release of the bone <b>resorbing</b> activity by MCF- 7 cells incubated with 17 beta-estradiol was inhibited by indomethacin (10 microM) and flufenamic acid (50 microM), two structurally unrelated compounds that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. Concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and nafoxidine that caused increased release of bone <b>resorbing</b> activity by the breast cancer cells caused a four- to fivefold increase in release of prostaglandins of the E series by MCF- 7 cells. These data may explain why some patients {{with advanced}} breast cancer develop acute hypercalcemia when treated with estrogens or antiestrogens, and why bone metastases are more common in patients with estrogen receptor positive tumors...|$|R
40|$|Destructive {{osteoarthritis}} is characterised by rapidly progressive joint destruction {{associated with}} intra-articular deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals. The possible role of such crystals in {{the pathogenesis of}} this condition was investigated by testing the ability of hydroxyapatite crystals to stimulate the production of bone <b>resorbing</b> activity from mouse peritoneal macrophages. Urate crystals were used for comparison. Culture supernatants were tested for bone <b>resorbing</b> activity using the mouse calvarial bone resorption assay, for interleukin 1 using a standard lymphocyte activation assay, and for prostaglandin E 2 by radioimmunoassay. Culture supernatants from macrophages incubated with hydroxyapatite crystals contained dialysable bone <b>resorbing</b> activity, high concentrations of prostaglandin E 2, but no interleukin 1 like activity.

25|$|Dentures {{that fit}} well {{during the first}} few years after {{creation}} will not necessarily fit well {{for the rest of the}} wearer's lifetime. This is because the bone and mucosa of the mouth are living tissues, which are dynamic over decades. Bone remodeling never stops in living bone. Edentulous jaw ridges tend to <b>resorb</b> progressively over the years, especially the alveolar ridge of the lower jaw. Mucosa reacts to being chronically rubbed by the dentures. Poorly fitting dentures hasten both of those processes compared to the rates with well-fitting dentures. Poor fitting dentures may also lead to the development of conditions such as epulis fissuratum.|$|E
25|$|The protein spans this {{membrane}} {{and acts}} as a channel connecting the inner part of the cell (cytoplasm) to the surrounding fluid. This channel is primarily responsible for controlling the movement of halogens from inside to outside of the cell; however, in the sweat ducts, it facilitates the movement of chloride from the sweat duct into the cytoplasm. When the CFTR protein does not <b>resorb</b> ions in sweat ducts, chloride and thiocyanate released from sweat glands are trapped inside the ducts and pumped to the skin. Additionally hypothiocyanite, OSCN, cannot be produced by the immune defense system. Because chloride is negatively charged, this modifies the electrical potential {{inside and outside the}} cell that normally causes cations to cross into the cell. Sodium is the most common cation in the extracellular space. The excess chloride within sweat ducts prevents sodium resorption by epithelial sodium channels and the combination of sodium and chloride creates the salt, which is lost in high amounts in the sweat of individuals with CF. This lost salt forms the basis for the sweat test.|$|E
500|$|NEDD9 binds {{directly}} to the Aurora-A mitotic kinase at the centrosome, and promotes its activity, allowing cells to enter mitosis. [...] Degradation of NEDD9 {{at the end of}} mitosis contributes to timely Aurora-A degradation. [...] Cell overexpressing NEDD9 exhibit deficient cytokinesis resulting in accumulation of multipolar mitotic spindles and abnormal numbers of centrosomes. On the other hand, cells with depleted NEDD9 have prematurely separated centrosomes and are deficient in microtubule organizing activity at mitosis leading to abundance of monopolar or asymmetric spindles, preventing cells from entering mitosis. NEDD9 also regulates Aurora-A activation at the basal body of cilia as cells <b>resorb</b> cilia during early G1. [...] Cilia are small organelles that protrude from the surface of adherent cells that are the obligate site of action for proteins such as Hedgehog, and the polycystins: by influencing ciliary stability, NEDD9 is positioned to affect these signaling systems. Interaction of NEDD9 with Aurora A kinase may also play a role in tumor invasion. NEDD9 binds to and regulates acetylation of cortactin (CTTN) in an Aurora A kinase (AURKA)/HDAC6–dependent manner. The knockdown of NEDD9 or AURKA results in an increase in the amount of acetylated CTTN and a decrease in the binding of CTTN to F-actin. Overexpression of the deacetylation mimicking (9KR) mutant of CTTN is sufficient to restore actin dynamics at the leading edge and migration proficiency of the tumor cells. Inhibition of AURKA and HDAC6 activity by alisertib and tubastatin A in xenograft models of breast cancer leads to a {{decrease in the number of}} pulmonary metastases.|$|E

500|$|Many other {{diseases}} of the kidney are associated with liver disease and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. [...] Individuals with pre-renal kidney failure do not have damage to the kidneys, but as in individuals with HRS, have kidney dysfunction due to decreased {{blood flow to the}} kidneys. Also, similarly to HRS, pre-renal kidney failure causes the formation of urine that has a very low sodium concentration. In contrast to HRS, however, pre-renal kidney failure usually responds to treatment with intravenous fluids, resulting in reduction in serum creatinine and increased excretion of sodium. [...] Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) involves damage to the tubules of the kidney, and can be a complication in individuals with cirrhosis, because of exposure to toxic medications or the development of decreased blood pressure. [...] Because of the damage to the tubules, ATN affected kidneys usually are unable to maximally <b>resorb</b> sodium from the urine. [...] As a result, ATN can be distinguished from HRS on the basis of laboratory testing, as individuals with ATN will have urine sodium measurements that are much higher than in HRS; however, this may not always be the case in cirrhotics. [...] Individuals with ATN also may have evidence of hyaline casts or muddy-brown casts in the urine on microscopy, whereas the urine of individuals with HRS is typically devoid of cellular material, as the kidneys have not been directly injured. [...] Some viral infections of the liver, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also lead to inflammation of the glomerulus of the kidney. [...] Other causes of kidney failure in individuals with liver disease include drug toxicity (notably, the antibiotic gentamicin) or contrast nephropathy, caused by intravenous administration of contrast agents used for medical imaging tests.|$|E
