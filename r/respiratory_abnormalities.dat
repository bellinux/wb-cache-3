Whilst the majority of studies of cardiorespiratory function have focused on changes during seizures, here we investigate whether epilepsy influences basal respiratory parameters in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during the interictal period. Spirometry was performed in 10 females and 10 males. Measurements of Vital Capacity (VC), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV 1) and ratios of FEV 1 to FVC (FEV 1 /FVC) were obtained, and these values were analyzed as percentages of predicted values.

50|$|This {{condition}} {{is also known}} as arylsulfatase E deficiency, CDPX1, and X-linked recessive chondrodysplasia punctata 1. The syndrome rarely affects females, but they can be carriers of the recessive allele. Although the exact number of people diagnosed with CDPX1 is unknown, it was estimated that 1 in 500,000 have CDPX1 in varying severity. This {{condition is}} not linked to a specific ethnicity. The mutation that leads to a deficiency in arylsulfatase E. (ARSE) occurs in the coding region of the gene.Absence of stippling, deposits of calcium, of bones and cartilage, shown on x-ray, does not rule out chondrodysplasia punctata or a normal chondrodysplasia punctata 1 (CDPX1) gene without mutation. Stippling of the bones and cartilage is rarely seen after childhood. Phalangeal abnormalities are important clinical features to look for once the stippling is no longer visible. Other, more severe, clinical features include <b>respiratory</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> hearing loss, cervical spine abnormalities, delayed cognitive development, ophthalmologic abnormalities, cardiac abnormalities, gastroesophageal reflux, and feeding difficulties. CDPX1 actually has a spectrum of severity; different mutations within the CDPX1 gene have different effects on the catalytic activity of the ARSE protein.

EEGs consistently showed multifocal spikes in various brain locations. Cardiologic assessment was normal. Case 7. This case demonstrates that Panayiotopoulos syndrome can also occur with consistently normal interictal EEGs.At the age of 2 years, a girl had an autonomic status epilepticus during sleep. This was characterized by pallor, progressive impairment of consciousness, and vomiting that lasted 45 minutes. A second episode occurred after 11 months, during sleep, and consisted of impairment of consciousness, hypotonia, deviation of the eyes to the right, hypersalivation, and right-sided clonic convulsions. It was terminated after 45 minutes with rectal diazepam. Treatment with carbamazepine was initiated. After 6 months, she had a third episode similar to the previous ones, but shorter. At the age of 4 years 9 months, during an ambulatory EEG, she had another autonomic seizure with marked ictal EEG abnormalities, but again, the interictal did not show any spikes. Carbamazepine was replaced with phenobarbital. All 12 interictal EEGs during the active seizure period, 6 of them during sleep, were normal.

Serum ferritin was measured. The signal intensity ratio of liver to that of paraspinal muscle (T 1 weighted sequence) and serum ferri-tin were used as surrogate index of body iron content. Results: Sixteen boys and 13 girls (median age 14. 2 years) were studied. None had clinical evidence of congestive heart failure. Sixteen had normal lung function. Impairment of diffusion capacity (median DLco 83. 5 % predicted) was the most common abnormality, being observed in 34 % of patients. Pure restrictive and obstructive ventilatory impairment was found in one and two patients respectively. Five patients had a combination of ventilation and diffusion defects.

The mechanisms of lung injury in this new population are largely unknown. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) represents the current state-of-the-art in the assessment of lung function. The present work uses the FOT to improve our knowledge about the <b>respiratory</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in SCA, evaluates the associations of FOT with the functional exercise capacity and investigates the early detection of <b>respiratory</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Spirometric classification of restrictive abnormalities resulted in three categories: controls (n = 23), patients with a normal exam (n = 21) and presenting pulmonary restriction (n = 24). FOT analysis showed that, besides restrictive changes (reduced compliance; p< 0. 001), there is also an increase in respiratory resistance (p< 0. 001) and ventilation heterogeneity (p< 0. 01). FOT parameters are associated with functional exercise capacity (R = - 0. 38), pulmonary diffusion (R = 0. 66), respiratory muscle performance (R = 0. 41), pulmonary volumes (R = 0. 56) and airway obstruction (R = 0. 54). The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by investigating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A combination of FOT and machine learning (ML) classifiers showed adequate diagnostic accuracy in the detection of early <b>respiratory</b> <b>abnormalities</b> (AUC = 0. 82). In this study, the use of FOT showed that adults with SCA develop a mixed pattern of respiratory disease. Changes in FOT parameters are associated with functional exercise capacity decline, abnormal pulmonary mechanics and diffusion.

Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Thoroughbred horses (n[*]=[*] 8). Methods Of 600 over ground dynamic endoscopic examinations performed, 8 Thoroughbred horses had cricotracheal ligament collapse (CTLC); 5 were 2 years old and in early training and 2 were mature horses in full work. CTLC was diagnosed if circumferential collapse of the cricotracheal ligament was identified during exercise. Seven horses had repeat endoscopic examination. Two horses unresponsive to conservative management were treated surgically. Results Multiple abnormalities of the upper portion of the respiratory tract were identified along with CTLC in all five 2 -year-old horses and resolution of CTLC was observed after treatment for upper airway inflammation. No concurrent <b>respiratory</b> <b>abnormality</b> was identified in the 2 mature horses. Surgical reduction of the cricotracheal space and imbrication of the cricotracheal ligament of these 2 horses resulted in resolution of clinical signs of CTLC.

40|$|International audienceThe Hox genetic network plays a {{key role}} in the anteroposterior {{patterning}} of the rhombencephalon at pre- and early-segmental stages of development of the neural tube. In the mouse, it controls development of the entire brainstem respiratory neuronal network, including the pons, the parafacial respiratory group (pFRG) and the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC). Inactivation of Krox 20 /Egr 2 eliminates the pFRG activity, thereby causing life-threatening neonatal apnoeas alternating with respiration at low frequency. Another <b>respiratory</b> <b>abnormality,</b> the complete absence of breathing, is induced when neuronal synchronization fails to develop in the preBötC. The present paper summarizes data on a third type of respiratory deficits induced by altering Hox function at pontine levels. Inactivation of Hoxa 2, the most rostrally expressed Hox gene in the hindbrain, disturbs embryonic development of the pons and alters neonatal inspiratory shaping without affecting respiratory frequency and apnoeas. The same result is obtained by the Phox 2 a(+/-) mutation modifying the number of petrosal chemoafferent neurons, by eliminating acetylcholinesterase and by altering Hox-dependent development of the pons with retinoic acid administration at embryonic day 7. 5. In addition, embryos treated with retinoic acid provide a mouse model for hyperpnoeic episodic breathing, widely reported in pre-term neonates, young girls with Rett's syndrome, patients with Joubert syndrome and adults with Cheyne-Stokes respiration. We conclude that specific respiratory deficits in vivo are assignable to anteroposterior segments of the brainstem, suggesting that the adult respiratory neuronal network is functionally organized according to the rhombomeric, Hox-dependent segmentation of the brainstem in embryos...|$|R

40|$|The current {{reference}} {{test for}} the detection of <b>respiratory</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in asbestos-exposed workers is spirometry. However, spirometry has several shortcomings that greatly affect the efficacy of current asbestos control programs. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) represents the current state-of-the-art technique in the assessment of lung function. This method provides a detailed analysis of respiratory resistance and reactance at different oscillatory frequencies during tidal breathing. Here, we evaluate the FOT as an alternative method to standard spirometry for the early detection and quantification of <b>respiratory</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in asbestos-exposed workers. Seventy-two subjects were analyzed. The control group was composed of 33 subjects with a normal spirometric exam who had no history of smoking or pulmonary disease. Thirty-nine subjects exposed to asbestos were also studied, including 32 volunteers in radiological category 0 / 0 and 7 volunteers with radiological categories of 0 / 1 or 1 / 1. FOT data were interpreted using classical parameters as well as integer (InOr) and fractional-order (FrOr) modeling. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by investigating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Exposed workers presented increased obstruction (resistance p< 0. 001) and a reduced compliance (p< 0. 001), with a predominance of obstructive changes. The FOT parameter changes were correlated with the standard pulmonary function analysis methods (R = - 0. 52, p< 0. 001). Early <b>respiratory</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were identified with a high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0. 987) using parameters obtained from the FrOr modeling. This accuracy was significantly better than those obtained with classical (p< 0. 001) and InOr (p< 0. 001) model parameters. The FOT improved our knowledge about the biomechanical abnormalities in workers exposed to asbestos. Additionally, a high diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of early <b>respiratory</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in asbestos-exposed workers was obtained. This makes the FOT particularly useful as a screening tool in the context of asbestos control and elimination. Moreover, it can facilitate epidemiological research and the longitudinal follow-up of asbestos exposure and asbestos-related diseases...|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that in brain-injured patients the principal morbidity and mortality are most frequently caused by the primary disease, i. e. cerebral nervous system injury and its neurological consequences [1]. Nevertheless, extracerebral organ dysfunctions are frequent in brain-injured patients, in creasing morbidity and mortality [2, 3]. Among them, the most frequent complication is respiratory dysfunction including pulmonary oedema and pneumonia. It {{is now clear that}} there is an entire spectrum of pulmonary abnormalities caused either directly or indirectly by acute brain injury. Although respiratory problems seem to play a relevant role in the clinical management of brain-injured patients, very few studies have investigated <b>respiratory</b> function <b>abnormalities</b> in this category of patients [4]...|$|R
40|$|Seventy-six {{patients}} with cystic fibrosis seen between 1950 and 1964 were studied, all having been first seen {{before the age}} of 1 year. In retrospect, the year 1957 seemed to be a watershed in the treatment of this series of patients, and they were therefore divided into 2 groups. Group A, 30 patients seen before 1957; Group B, 46 patients seen after 1957. The clinical, radiological, and bacteriological findings in the 2 groups at entry were similar as to age of incidence, severity of the initial <b>respiratory</b> symptoms, <b>abnormalities</b> on chest radiographs, and bacteriology of the cultures of cough swabs. Treatment of Group B patients was generally more vigorous, with antibiotics used more efficiently to treat pulmonary infection...|$|R
40|$|Merkel cell {{carcinoma}} (MCC) {{of the skin}} is a rare, aggressive, malignant neuroendocrine neoplasm. The tumor classically demonstrates positive immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for chromogranin A(ChrA), cytokeratin 20 (CK 20), neuron specific enolase (NSE) and/or achaete-acute complex-like 1 (MASH 1). The newly identified Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) {{has been found to}} be associated with most MCC cases. The primary histologic differential diagnoses of cutaneous MCC is small cell primary bronchogenic carcinoma (SCLC); moreover, both are of neuroendocrine origin. SCLC accounts for approximately 10 - 15 % of all primary lung cancer cases; this histologic subtype is a distinct entity with biological and oncological features distinct from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In contradistinction to MCC, SCLC is classically IHC positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK 7) and transcription factor (TTF- 1). Similar to SCLC, MCC cell lines may be classified into two different biochemical subgroups designated as Classic and Variant. In our review and case report, we aim to emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the approach to this difficult differential diagnosis. We also aim to comment about features of the cells of origin of MCC and SCLC; to summarize the microscopic features of both tumors; and to review their respective epidemiologic, clinical, prognostic and treatment features. We want to emphasize the initial workup study of the differential diagnosis patient, including evaluating clinical lymph nodes, a clinical history of any <b>respiratory</b> <b>abnormality,</b> and chest radiogram. If a diagnosis of primary cutaneous MCC is confirmed, classic treatment includes excision of the primary tumor with wide margins, excision of a sentinel lymph node, and computed tomography, positron emission tomography and/or Fluorine- 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan studie...|$|R
