25|$|Primary {{sequencing}} of the maize genome {{was completed in}} 2008. On November 20, 2009, the consortium published results of its sequencing effort in Science. The genome, 85% of which is composed of transposons, was found to contain 32,540 genes (By comparison, the human genome contains about 2.9 billion bases and 26,000 genes). Much of the maize genome has been duplicated and reshuffled by helitrons—group of <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> transposons.|$|E

5000|$|Most authors use epitrochoid {{to mean a}} {{roulette}} of a <b>circle</b> <b>rolling</b> {{around the}} outside of another circle, hypotrochoid to mean a roulette of a <b>circle</b> <b>rolling</b> around the inside of another circle, and trochoid to mean a roulette of a <b>circle</b> <b>rolling</b> along a line. However, some authors (for example http://www.monmouth.com/~chenrich/Trochoids/Trochoids.html following F. Morley) use [...] "trochoid" [...] to mean a roulette of a <b>circle</b> <b>rolling</b> along another <b>circle,</b> though this is inconsistent with the more common terminology. The term Centered trochoid as adopted by http://www.mathcurve.com/courbes2d/trochoid/trochoidale.shtml combines epitrochoid and hypotrochoid into a single concept to streamline mathematical exposition and remains consistent with the existing standard.|$|R

25|$|The hairpin {{ribozyme}} {{is a small}} {{section of}} RNA that {{can act as a}} ribozyme. Like the hammerhead ribozyme it is found in RNA satellites of plant viruses. It was first identified in the minus strand of the tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) satellite RNA where it catalyzes self-cleavage and joining (ligation) reactions to process the products of <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> virus replication into linear and circular satellite RNA molecules. The hairpin ribozyme is similar to the hammerhead ribozyme in that it does not require a metal ion for the reaction.|$|E
25|$|In {{the single}} {{stranded}} DNA viruses — {{a group that}} includes the circoviruses, the geminiviruses, the parvoviruses and others — and also the many phages and plasmids that use the <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> replication (RCR) mechanism, the RCR endonuclease creates a nick in the genome strand (single stranded viruses) {{or one of the}} DNA strands (plasmids). The 5′ end of the nicked strand is transferred to a tyrosine residue on the nuclease and the free 3′ OH group is then used by the DNA polymerase to synthesize the new strand.|$|E
25|$|The hairpin {{ribozyme}} is an RNA motif that catalyzes RNA processing reactions {{essential for}} replication {{of the satellite}} RNA molecules {{in which it is}} embedded. These reactions are self-processing, i.e. a molecule rearranging its own structure. Both cleavage and end joining reactions are mediated by the ribozyme motif, leading to a mixture of interconvertible linear and circular satellite RNA molecules. These reactions are important for processing the large multimeric RNA molecules that are generated by <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> replication. At the end of the replication cycle, these large intermediates of satellite RNA replication are processed down to unit length molecules (circular or linear) before they can be packaged by viruses and carried to other cells for further rounds of replication.|$|E

50|$|In geometry, a {{centered}} trochoid is the roulette {{formed by}} a <b>circle</b> <b>rolling</b> along another <b>circle.</b> That is, {{it is the}} path traced by a point attached to a circle as the circle rolls without slipping along a fixed circle. The term encompasses both epitrochoid and hypotrochoid. The center of this curve is defined {{to be the center}} of the fixed circle.|$|R
5000|$|The curve [...] {{remains the}} same if the indexes 1 and 2 are {{reversed}} but the resulting values of , [...] and , in general, do not. This produces the Dual generation theorem which states that, {{with the exception of}} the special case discussed below, any centered trochoid can be generated in two essentially different ways as the roulette of a <b>circle</b> <b>rolling</b> on another <b>circle.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{mechanism}} for chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) replication {{has not been}} conclusively determined, but two main models have been proposed. Scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since the 1970s. The results of the microscopy experiments led {{to the idea that}} chloroplast DNA replicates using a double displacement loop (D-loop). As the D-loop moves through the circular DNA, it adopts a theta intermediary form, also known as a Cairns replication intermediate, and completes replication with a <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> mechanism. Transcription starts at specific points of origin. Multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to transcribe the DNA. As replication continues, the forks grow and eventually converge. The new cpDNA structures separate, creating daughter cpDNA chromosomes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rolling</b> <b>circle</b> {{replication}} {{describes a}} process of unidirectional nucleic acid replication that can rapidly synthesize multiple copies of circular molecules of DNA or RNA, such as plasmids, the genomes of bacteriophages, and the circular RNA genome of viroids. Some eukaryotic viruses also replicate their DNA via the <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> mechanism. Usually under the name <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> amplification, the mechanism is also widely used in the laboratory in molecular biology research and in nanotechnology.|$|E

5000|$|These {{issues of}} {{infinity}} arise from problems of <b>rolling</b> <b>circles.</b> If two concentric circles of different radii roll along lines, then if the larger does not slip it appears {{clear that the}} smaller must slip. But in what way? Galileo attempts to clarify the matter by considering hexagons and then extending to rolling 100 000-gons, or n-gons, where he shows that {{a finite number of}} finite slips occur on the inner shape. Eventually, he concludes [...] "the line traversed by the larger circle consists then of an infinite number of points which completely fill it; while that which is traced by the smaller circle consists of an infinite number of points which leave empty spaces and only partly fill the line," [...] which would not be considered satisfactory now.|$|R

40|$|Intracellular {{forms of}} M 13 phage DNA {{isolated}} after infection of Escherichia coli with wild-type phage {{have been studied}} by electron microscopy and ultracentrifugation. The data indicate the involvement of rolling-circle intermediates in single-stranded DNA synthesis.

The tails in theta molecules are always single stranded and are never longer than the DNA from mature phage; the proportion of theta to other RF molecules does not change significantly with time after infection. The origin of single-stranded DNA synthesis has been mapped by electron microscopy at a unique location on RF DNA by use of partial denaturation mapping and restriction endonuclease digestion.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Computer software, {{particular}} that known as Dynamic Geometry Software, {{has the potential}} to make significant improvements in how geometry is learnt and taught. For a long period geometry teaching has been conducted with a minimal amount of equipment – such as ruler and pair of compasses. Our view is that teachers should now have at their disposal an appropriate va-riety of equipment from which to select. As with any approach to teaching, the educational use of information and communication technology as well as computer software needs to be well thought through and carefully planned. In this paper we will concentrate on WinCAG (Windows version of Computer Aided Geometry) which has been especially designed for teaching and learning geometry. With this software package both simple constructions and complicated dependencies can easily be animated. We will particular focus on some special capabilities of WinCAG. These are the map-ping module, automated animations, building curves by tracing points, <b>rolling</b> <b>circles,</b> envelopes of moving objects, subdivision curves and the object recognition from free-hand drawings...|$|R
