The replacement was successful, but he suffered a slight stroke, affecting his right hand. This brought his career as a performer to an end. While in hospital Britten became friendly with a senior nursing sister, Rita Thomson; she moved to Aldeburgh in 1974 and looked after him until his death.|$|E

5|$|From its beginning, {{the main}} {{features}} of the metric system were the standard set of interrelated base units and a standard set of prefixes in powers of ten. These base units are used to derive larger and smaller units that could <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> huge number of other units of measure in existence. Although the system was first developed for commercial use, the development of coherent units of measure made it particularly suitable for science and engineering.|$|E

5|$|In June 1981, new once-weekly routes linking Horsham to Steyning and Cranleigh/Ewhurst to Brighton were introduced, {{the second}} to <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> {{withdrawn}} Southdown Motor Services service. To improve profits on the Brighton route, beer was carried from the Sussex Brewery near Edburton to public houses along the route alongside passengers. The scheduled service operations of coach firm McCann's were acquired, together with three vehicles, on 1 November 1982, although some were withdrawn a year later.|$|E

5|$|Meechum remains Underwood's {{bodyguard}} once {{he becomes}} the president, and there {{does not appear to}} be any continuing sexual relationship. Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks) not to write anything that would damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's hand with a marker on one of the walls of the White House when he wants to <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead.|$|E
5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere.

5|$|The first {{transportation}} routes along {{what is now}} US23 in {{the state}} were sections of two Indian trails. The route {{of what is now}} US23 follows portions of two separate trails. In the early 20th century, four different auto trail names were applied to roads now a part of the highway. These roads were included as part of two state highways in the initial state highway system in 1919. When the United States Numbered Highway System was first designated on November 11, 1926, the new US23 replaced the other designations along its route. Since creation, the road has been moved and realigned several times. Through the 1930s and 1940s, the lakeshore routing was created to <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> path that ran further inland through the northern portion of the state. Starting in the early 1950s, various sections in the southeastern and central areas of the LP were upgraded to freeways, bypassing several major cities in the area. These improvements were completed {{by the end of the}} 1960s. Since then a new crossing of the Saginaw River at Zilwaukee was built to <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> drawbridge that carried the I-75/US23 freeway over a shipping channel.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no sexual}} dimorphism. Juveniles {{are very similar}} to adults, but the streaks on the mantle are blue rather than white. The primary coverts of juveniles are also more closely lined with blue, and the underparts are paler overall, {{especially}} on the chest. Adults perform a complete moult after the breeding season, whereas juveniles only have a partial moult, in which they <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> variable number of rectrices.|$|E

5|$|In August 1863, {{as part of}} {{his duties}} as aide-de-camp to General Barnard, Alexander was named {{as a member of a}} board of {{military}} officers who would examine the defenses of Washington and suggest improvements as needed. The board, created by the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, was designed to <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> civilian board that he had created in 1862. In a November 1863 meeting, this board recommended final allotments of guns and ammunition for the forts protecting Washington, D.C., thus establishing the number of guns that would be in place during the Battle of Fort Stevens eight months later.|$|E
5|$|Like in Texas, a {{mosquito}} outbreak occurred in Louisiana. Only pesticides {{acceptable to the}} US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Fish and Wildlife Service were allowed to be used. FEMA officials warned homeowners {{of the dangers of}} floodwaters, including mold, mildew, and bacteria. By three months after the storm, just under 100,000 Louisiana citizens applied for federal aid, totaling to over $110million (2001USD, $143million 2012USD). $25million (2001USD, $32million 2012USD) of the total was for business loans, while an additional $8million was for public assistance for communities and state agencies. More than 750 flood victims in Florida applied for governmental aid, totaling to $1.29million (2001USD, $1.5million 2007USD). In Pennsylvania, 1,670 flood victims applied for federal aid, totaling to $11.5million (2001USD, $14.3million 2012USD). $3.4million (2001USD, $4.4million 2012USD) of the total was to <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> SEPTA rail bridge over Sandy Run in Fort Washington.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{had been}} a {{significant}} border settlement since the Roman occupation of Britain, when it {{was the site of}} the fort of Blestium. The River Wye may have been bridged at this time but the Monnow, being easily fordable, appears not to have had a crossing until after the Norman Conquest. According to the local tradition, construction of Monnow Bridge began in 1272 to <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> 12th-century Norman timber bridge. Through the medieval era, the English Civil War, and the Chartist uprising, the bridge played a significant, if ineffectual, role in defending Monmouth. It also served as a gaol, a munitions store, a lodge, an advertising hoarding, a focus for celebrations and, most significantly, as a toll gate. Much of the medieval development of Monmouth was funded by the taxes and tolls the borough was entitled to raise through Royal Charter. The tolls were collected through control of the points of entry to the town, including the gatehouse on Monnow Bridge.|$|E
