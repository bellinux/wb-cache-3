40|$|In {{this paper}} 16 {{different}} <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> for one-seat elections are analysed: {{the rules of}} Borda, Condorcet, Black, Copeland, Simpson, Hare, Coombs, Baldwin, Nanson and the plurality, anti-plurality, majority, approval and runoff rules. The 2 criteria we use as a measure for {{the validity of the}} <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> are Condorcet efficiency (the number of times a <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> selects the Condorcet winner) and Borda efficiency (the number of times a <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> selects the Borda winner). Computer simulations calculate efficiencies for the 16 <b>voting</b> <b>procedures.</b> We find that the Borda rule is about 85 % Condorcet efficient while some <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> are always 100 % Condorcet efficient (Black, Copeland, Simpson, Baldwin, Nanson). Another rule is only 100 % Condorcet efficient with single peaked profiles (Coombs). This can be proven theoretically. Another feature from single peaked profiles seems to be that some <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> select the same winner (Simpson, Baldwin, and Nanson). This result may be interesting for future research. Considering Borda efficiencies we see that the Black rule scores well, followed by the rules of Copeland, Nanson and Baldwin. Taking both Condorcet and Borda efficiencies into account, we can state that the Black rule is superior. Then come the rules of Copeland, Simpson, Nanson and Baldwin. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{analysis}} of Dutta, Jackson and Le Breton (Econometrica, 2001) on strategic candidacy to probabilistic environments. For each agenda and each profile of voters’ preferences over running candidates, a probabilistic <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> selects a lottery {{on the set of}} running candidates. Assuming that candidates cannot vote, we show that random dictatorships are the only unanimous probabilistic <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> that never provide unilateral incentives for the candidates to withdraw their candidacy at any set of potential candidates. More flexible probabilistic <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> can be devised if we restrict our attention to the stability of specific sets of potential candidates.

40|$|Increasingly, {{scholars}} of legislative politics propose comparative analyses of parliamentary voting behavior across different countries and parliaments. Yet parliamentary <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> differ dramatically across parliamentary chambers and ignoring these differences may, in the extreme, lead to meaningless comparisons.

40|$|The paper {{challenges}} the 'orthodox doctrine' of collective choice theory {{according to which}} Arrow 2 ̆ 019 s 'general possibility theorem' precludes rational decision procedures generally and implies that in particular all <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> must be flawed. I point out that all <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> are cardinal and that Arrow 2 ̆ 019 s result, based on preference orderings cannot apply to them. All <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> that have been proposed, {{with the exception of}} approval voting, involve restrictions on voters expressions of their preferences. These restrictions, not any general impossibility, are the cause of various well known pathologies. In the class of unrestricted <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> I favor 'evaluative voting' under which a voter can vote for or against any alternative, or abstain.

40|$|The strong {{candidate}} stability theorem by Dutta et al. [4], one of {{the major}} theoremsof social choice theory, states that, with a finite number of voters, there exists a dictator for any <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> which satisfies strong candidate stability, strong unanimity and independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). This paper investigates a decidability problem of <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> in a society with an infinite number of individuals (infinite society) using Cantor's diagonal argument presented by Yanofsky [19] which is based on Lawvere [10]. We will show the following result. The problem whether a strongly candidate stable <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> has a dictator or has no dictator in an infinite society is undecidable. It is proved using the arguments similar to those used to prove an extended version of Cantor's theorem that there cannot be an onto function from (the set of natural numbers) to its power set (). This undecidability means that for any strongly candidate stable <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> we can not decide whether or not it has a dictator in finite steps by some program. A dictator of a <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> is a voter such that if he strictly prefers a candidate (denoted by x) to another candidate (denoted by y), then the <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> does not choose y. Strong candidate stability requires that there be no change in the outcome of an election if a candidate withdraws who would lose ifevery candidate stood for office...|$|R
