Blackburn et al. [20] note that products with short sales cycles are threatened with additional costs through slow processing.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Several mixed {{industry}} prediction models about failure {{have been}} reasonably successful in differentiating between successful companies {{and those that}} have failed. The challenge, however, is to venture into the grey area in between and to identify companies, which are financially unstable, at an early stage. Early identification enables management to intervene timeously {{in an attempt to}} prevent failure. Failure is defined as either liquidation, delisting, suspension of listing or a substantial change in structure. The grey area focused on in this study is overtrading. Overtrading is triggered by the company growing at too high a rate relative to its specific structure. Cash is necessary to fund expansion, whether for an increase in inventories, credit sales or new non-current assets. If the company does not generate enough cash to fund this expansion, it has to be financed through external sources. The longer the period of growth and the higher the growth rate, the more the cash requirements. From the theoretical model underlying overtrading, it was found that: • the higher the growth in sales, • the smaller the profit margin, and • the higher the net current assets in proportion to total assets, the lower the cash flow from operating activities before dividends were paid (CFO). Any company ought to generate enough cash from its daily activities {{in order to maintain the}} existing level of business, to repay loans, to replace assets and to pay dividends. If the internal generation of cash is insufficient to finance these activities, existing cash resources will be consumed, unproductive non-current assets will be sold and possibly also some of the productive non-current assets. The outcome for such a company is a business combination or liquidation. Due to the fact that cash plays such a big role in failure, cash flow variables constitute the majority of the independent variables used in the development of the failure prediction models. The overtrading ratio was developed as a measurement tool to quantify overtrading. As long as the company generates a positive CFO, it is not so much at risk as a company that does not succeed in generating a positive CFO. Therefore, a negative CFO for a three-year period was decided on as the norm for identifying possible financial difficulty. A company is involved in overtrading if the sum of CFO for three years less the sum of the adjusted profit for the three years, divided by the absolute value of the sum of the adjusted profit for the three years equals - 1 or smaller in the case of a company with a cumulative profit for the three years; and smaller than nought in the case of a company with a cumulative loss for the three years. South African industrial companies listed for at least three years during the period 1974 to 2003, were identified. From a total of 6 662 cumulative three-year periods, 944 overtrading years were identified. Failure occurred in 212 out of 526 companies involved in overtrading between January 1974 and August 1989. 120 out of 199 companies involved in overtrading between September 1989 and November 1995 failed, while 90 out of 127 companies involved in overtrading, failed between December 1995 and June 2000. By June 2005 it was already evident that 49 out of 92 companies involved in overtrading between July 2000 and December 2003, had already failed. Companies involved in overtrading, may survive artificially for lengthy periods with the support of providers of capital. It can therefore be expected that failure prediction models will not achieve a better accuracy rate than achieved by probabilities. Six failure prediction models utilising classification tree algorithms were developed. Using data from two periods, two different models were developed; one for growth and recession phases of the economy, the other without distinction between economic phases. The first period was September 1989 to June 2000, the other December 1995 to June 2000. June 2000 was chosen as the cut-off, since a period of five years after an overtrading year was necessary to follow-up whether the company had failed. Each universe was split in two – the learning sample, more or less 60 %, and the test sample, more or less 40 %. The models were developed from the learning sample and the test sample was used as substantiation of the results of the developed model. The total classification accuracy of the three best models, one for the growth-phase, one for the recession-phase and one mixed economy model, is respectively 72, 99 %, 96, 67 % and 80, 26 % and the classification accuracy for the failed companies 75, 29 %, 100 % and 85, 19 % respectively. The total prediction accuracy of the three models is respectively 69, 23 %, 80, 95 % and 72, 55 %, and that of the failed companies 73, 68 %, 86, 67 % and 83, 33 %. The accuracy of all the models was found to be higher than what the accuracy would have been if all the companies involved in overtrading were merely classified as having failed. From the results of the different tests, it seems that Ver 3, the growth in sales from year 1 to year 3, is probably the most important independent variable in the classification between failed and non-failed overtrading years. This corroborates the theory underlying overtrading that indicates that a high sales growth puts a company at risk for cash flow problems. Companies where the cash flow problems develop because of an increase in current assets will be intercepted by the overtrading ratio. Companies where cash flow problems develop due to replacement of non-current assets, will not necessarily be intercepted by the overtrading ratio as CFO that is used in the overtrading ratio does not allow for replacement of non-current assets. It is therefore necessary to adjust CFO to a free cash flow CFO. Depreciation is used as an alternative for replacement investment since disclosure of replacement investment is not <b>required.</b> <b>Depreciation</b> is theoretically the fraction of the value of an asset lost during the year; this value needs to be replaced. By subtracting the depreciation for the year from CFO, this amount will be more representative of the cash position of the company after considering all the normal transactions in order to sustain the business. After all the adjustments for a free cash flow, six models were developed for the different periods and economic phases. The accuracy of these models were better than what the accuracy would have been if overtrading years were merely classified as failed. Implementing these models would therefore improve specificity. From the tests performed, Ver 3 and KVB 3 /TB (the cumulative CFO for the three years over total assets) seem to be the most important independent variables in the classification between failed and non-failed when considering free cash flow. This is informative as KVB 3 :TB represents a fictional amount, as if the company spent an amount equal to depreciation on replacement investment. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Heelwat gemengde industrie-mislukkingvoorspellingsmodelle was al redelik suksesvol in die onderskeid tussen mislukte en suksesvolle maatskappye. Die uitdaging is egter om die grys area tussen dié uiterstes te betree en ’n maatskappy wat finansieel onstabiel is, vroegtydig te identifiseer. Vroegtydige identifikasie stel die bestuur in staat om betyds in te gryp en mislukking te voorkom. Mislukking word as likwidasie, òf denotering, òf opskorting van notering, òf ’n wesenlike struktuurverandering, gedefinieer. Die grys area waarop die fokus in hierdie studie val, is oorbedryf. Oorbedryf word veroorsaak deurdat die maatskappy teen ’n te hoë koers relatief tot sy spesifieke struktuur groei. Kontant is nodig om uitbreiding, hetsy ’n toename in voorraad, kredietverkope of nuwe nie-bedryfsbates, te finansier. Indien die besigheid nie genoeg kontant genereer om hierdie uitbreiding te finansier nie, moet dit vanuit eksterne bronne gefinansier word. Hoe langer die tydperk van groei voortduur en hoe hoër die groeikoers is, hoe meer is die kontantbehoeftes. Uit die teoretiese model wat onderliggend is aan oorbedryf, is bevind dat: • hoe hoër die groei in verkope, • hoe kleiner die winspersentasie, en • hoe hoër die bedryfskapitaal in verhouding tot die totale bates; hoe laer is die kontantvloei uit bedryfsaktiwiteite voor dividende betaal (KVB). Enige besigheid behoort genoeg kontant uit dag-tot-dag-aktiwiteite te genereer ten einde die bestaande vlak van besigheid vol te hou, lenings terug te betaal, bates te vervang en dividende te betaal. Indien die interne kontantgenerering onvoldoende is om hierdie aktiwiteite te finansier, sal bestaande kontantbronne uitgewis word, onproduktiewe nie-bedryfsbates sal verkoop word en moontlik ook van die produktiewe nie-bedryfsbates. Die uiteinde vir so ’n maatskappy is ’n besigheidsoorname of ’n likwidasie. Aangesien kontantvloei so ’n groot rol in mislukking speel, is kontantvloeiveranderlikes die meerderheid van die onafhanklike veranderlikes wat in die ontwikkeling van die mislukkingvoorspellingsmodelle gebruik is. Die oorbedryfsratio is as ’n maatstaf ontwikkel om oorbedryf te meet. Solank as wat ’n maatskappy ’n positiewe KVB genereer, is hy nie so riskant soos ’n maatskappy wat nie daarin kan slaag om positiewe kontant te genereer nie. Daarom is ’n negatiewe kumulatiewe KVB vir ’n drie-jaar-tydperk as die norm gestel om moontlike finansiële nood te identifiseer. ’n Maatskappy is besig met oorbedryf indien die som van die KVB vir drie jaar minus die som van die aangepaste wins vir die drie jaar, gedeel deur die absolute waarde van die som van die aangepaste wins vir die drie jaar, gelyk aan of kleiner as - 1 is, in die geval van ’n maatskappy wat ’n kumulatiewe wins vir die drie jaar het; en kleiner as nul in die geval van ’n maatskappy wat ’n kumulatiewe verlies vir die drie jaar het. Alle Suid-Afrikaanse genoteerde industriële maatskappye wat vir ten minste drie jaar gedurende die tydperk 1974 tot 2003 genoteer was, is geïdentifiseer. Uit ’n totaal van 6 662 kumulatiewe drie-jaar-tydperke was daar 944 oorbedryfsjare. Vanaf Januarie 1974 tot Augustus 1989 was daar 526 oorbedryfsjare, waarvan 212 misluk het. Vanaf September 1989 tot November 1995 was daar 199 oorbedryfsjare, waarvan 120 misluk het en vanaf Desember 1995 tot Junie 2000 het 90 van 127 oorbedryfsjare misluk. Teen Junie 2005 was dit reeds bekend dat 49 van die 92 oorbedryfsjare tussen Julie 2000 en Desember 2003 misluk het. Oorbedryfsmaatskappye bly soms vir uitgebreide tydperke kunsmatig voortbestaan, indien die verskaffers van kapitaal hulle dra. Die verwagting was dus dat mislukkingvoorspellingsmodelle nie ’n beter akkuraatheid sou behaal as wat waarskynlikhede sou bepaal nie. Ses mislukkingvoorspellingsmodelle is met behulp van die klassifikasieboomalgoritme ontwikkel. Een model elk vir die groeifase en die resessie-fase van die ekonomie en een model sonder onderskeid van die ekonomiese fase is met die gebruikmaking van twee tydperke se data ontwikkel. Die eerste tydperk was September 1989 tot Junie 2000 en die ander Desember 1995 tot Junie 2000. Junie 2000 is as die afsnypunt gebruik aangesien ’n vyf-jaaropvolgtydperk na ’n oorbedryfsjaar nodig is om vas te stel of die maatskappy misluk het. Elke universum is in twee verdeel – die leersteekproef, ongeveer 60 %, en die toetssteekproef, ongeveer 40 %. Die modelle is uit die leersteekproef afgelei en die toetssteekproef is gebruik as bevestiging van die resultate van die afgeleide model. Die totale klassifikasie-akkuraatheid van die drie beste modelle, een vir die groeifase, een vir die resessie-fase en een gemengde ekonomiemodel, is onderskeidelik 72, 99 %, 96, 67 % en 80, 26 % en dié vir die mislukte maatskappye 75, 29 %, 100 % en 85, 19 %. Die totale voorspellingsakkuraatheid van die drie modelle is onderskeidelik 69, 23 %, 80, 95 % en 72, 55 % en dié van die mislukte maatskappye 73, 68 %, 86, 67 % en 83, 33 %. Al die modelle se akkuraatheid is meer as wat die akkuraatheid sou wees indien al die oorbedryfsjare bloot as misluk geklassifiseer sou wees. Uit die resultate van verskeie toetse blyk dit dat Ver 3, die groei in verkope vanaf jaar 1 tot jaar 3, waarskynlik die belangrikste onafhanklike veranderlike in die onderskeid tussen mislukte en nie-mislukte oorbedryfsjare is. Dit ondersteun die teorie wat onderliggend is aan oorbedryf, wat aandui dat ’n hoë groei in verkope ’n maatskappy op risiko plaas vir kontantvloeiprobleme. Maatskappye waar die kontantvloeiprobleme vanweë ’n uitbreiding in bedryfskapitaal ontstaan, word deur die oorbedryfsratio onderskep. Die maatskappye waar die kontantvloeiprobleme eerder uit die vervanging van nie-bedryfsbates sal voortvloei, sal nie noodwendig deur die oorbedryfsratio ondervang word nie, aangesien die KVB wat in die oorbedryfsratio gebruik word, nie voorsiening maak vir vervangende investering nie. Dit is daarom nodig om KVB tot ’n vrye kontantvloei-KVB aan te pas. Waardevermindering word as ’n alternatief vir vervangende investering gebruik, aangesien vervangende investering nie ’n verpligte openbaarmakingsvereiste is nie. Waardevermindering is teoreties dié deel van die bate wat gedurende die jaar opgebruik is en wat vervang behoort te word. Deur dus die jaarlikse waardevermindering van KVB af te trek, is hierdie syfer meer verteenwoordigend van die maatskappy se kontantposisie nadat alle normale transaksies om die besigheid in stand te hou, in ag geneem is. Na die aanpassings vir vrye kontantvloei is weer ses modelle uit die verskillende tydperke en vir die verskillende ekonomiese fases ontwikkel. Al die modelle se akkuraatheid is beter as wat die akkuraatheid sou wees indien al die oorbedryfsjare bloot as misluk geklassifiseer sou wees. Ver 3 en KVB 3 :TB (die kumulatiewe KVB vir die drie jaar tot die totale bates) blyk uit die toetse die belangrikste onafhanklike veranderlikes te wees in die onderskeid tussen misluk en nie-misluk wanneer vrye kontantvloei in ag geneem word. Dit is insiggewend aangesien KVB 3 :TB ’n fiktiewe syfer verteenwoordig, sou die maatskappy ’n bedrag wat gelyk is aan waardevermindering, aan vervangende investering bestee het...|$|E

40|$|Government {{accounting}} {{and other financial}} management practices have in recent times {{become one of the}} major target areas of public management reform. Public sector organisations traditionally use accounting systems based on cash inflows and cash outflows, commonly known as cash accounting. This cash style of accounting differs significantly from accounting systems used in the private sector, so called accrual accounting systems. The recent reforms to government accounting systems have focused largely on implementing accrual accounting in the public sector. The exponents of accrual accounting argue that it provides significantly more detailed and accurate financial information than cash systems. One of the basic principles of {{accounting and}} financial reporting is that it should provide a true and fair view of the financial operations and financial position of an entity. Given that cash accounting records cash transactions only, no consideration is given to assets and liabilities or to items extending beyond the accounting period (i. e. prepayments and accrued expenses). Accrual accounting on the other hand produces detailed information on assets and liabilities and <b>requires</b> <b>depreciation</b> expenses to be matched to the expected life of the related asset. Similarly, accruing expenses such as employee entitlements are represented in the financial reports.

The correction of global imbalances could lead to a prolonged fall in the external demand for European products as well as to increased competition from US firms.

The risk of a financial crisis will increase if a large fall in the dollar is accompanied by a drop in US and worldwide output.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the role that income tax incentives to landlords play in the determination of market rental rates. Landlords typically receive benefits from accelerated depreciation on real assets that are usually appreciating. The value of this tax benefit depends both on the depreciation schedule {{as well as the}} landlord's marginal tax rate. Changes in income tax law in the 1980 's dramatically affected both of these factors. In 1980, the top federal marginal tax rate was 70 %, and rental housing could be depreciated on a double-declining balance over 20 years. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1980 reduced the top marginal tax rate significantly. Changes were made in 1984 that altered the depreciation schedule so that rental property could be depreciated more rapidly. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reformed the depreciation schedule so that rental property had to be depreciated over 27 years: a significant change for landlords. In addition, the top federal marginal tax rate was reduced to 33 percent. The main direction of the changes in the federal tax code in the 1980 's was to decrease the tax advantages associated with rental property. Decreases in the top marginal tax rate reduced the value of tax write-offs, while increases in the length of time <b>required</b> for <b>depreciation</b> reduced the amount of depreciation taken each year.

The story is quite complex, and until 1974 was unusual by international standards, with a sophisticated Australian tariff debate and the remarkable transparency role of the Industry Assistance Commission (IAC), and its predecessor, the Tariff Board. The role of Alf Rattigan, Chairman of the Tariff Board and later the IAC, is stressed. Liberalisation since 1988 has been drastic, so that most tariffs will be brought down to 5 per cent by the year 2000. All quotas were ended by 1993. This can be contrasted with very high protection levels in 1967 and quite high levels even in 1987. Substantial unilateral trade liberalisation normally <b>requires</b> exchange rate <b>depreciation,</b> and the floating of the Australian dollar made the tariff reductions possible.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} and investigate the factors which determine the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) and affect its volatility in the Syrian economy over the period 1980 - 2008, using two estimation techniques, the Vector Error Correction Mode (VECM) and ARCH Model. According to the theoretical literature, there are many elements causing the (RER) volatility (relative productivity, government expenditure, terms of trade, trade openness and net foreign assets). The estimation excluded the last three non-significant variables and included gross capital formation and oil prices which are considered to be important factors in capturing the effect of these non-significant variables. The empirical results confirm the theoretical links between (RER) volatility and its determinants in the Syrian economy. Three main results are derived from the analysis: first, the actual Syrian (RER) has been volatile around its equilibrium level; in contrast, the speed of adjustment is relatively slow. Results from ARCH model estimation shows that the real shocks volatility will persist, so that shocks will die out rather slowly, and lasting misalignment seems to have occurred; second, the expected decline in Syrian oil production would <b>require</b> a significant <b>depreciation</b> of (RER), since it...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a dynamic {{stochastic}} general equilibrium model to evaluate 8 ̆ 5 nancial adjustments that some emerging market economies went through to overcome external crises during the latest decades, such as default and local currency devaluation. We assume that real devaluation can be used to avoid external debt default, to improve trade balance and to reduce the real public debt level denominated in local currency. Such e¤ects increase the government ability to deal with external crisis, but also have costs in terms of welfare, related to expected ination, reductions in private investments and higher interest to be paid over the public debt. We conclude that openness improves expected welfare as it allows for a better devaluation-response tech-nology against crises. We also present results for 32 middle-income countries, verifying that the proposed model can indicate, in a stylized way, the pref-erences for default-devaluation options and the magnitude of the currency <b>depreciation</b> <b>required</b> to overcome 48 external crises occurred as from 1971. Finally, as we construct our model based on the Cole-Kehoe self-ful 8 ̆ 5 lling debt crisis model ([7]), adding local debt and trade, it is important to say that their policy alternatives to leave the crisis zone remains in our extended model, namely, to reduce the external debt level and to lengthen its maturity...|$|R

The “safe-haven effect ” that caused a move into the dollar last fall {{resulted}} in a dollar appreciation of about 10 percent, which {{on top of an}} estimated overvaluation of about 7 percent a year ago made for an overvaluation of about 17 percent at the point of comparison (March 2009). Although the dollar declined about 5 percent from March to early June, it remains substantially overvalued. The principal counterpart to the overvalued dollar is the undervaluation of the Chinese renminbi, which would have needed to appreciate about 21 percent on a weighted average basis and about 40 percent against the dollar to achieve equilibrium. The vast majority of the 29 currencies studied need to appreciate against the dollar. For example, the yen needs to rise to 82 : 1 against the dollar (as against 95 to the dollar recently) and the euro should appreciate to $ 1. 53 (as against $ 1. 40 recently). However, a large number of currencies show no great evidence of misalignment on an effective (i. e., trade-weighted) basis. This is true of the euro area, the United Kingdom, Japan, Korea, several Latin American countries, a number of Central and Eastern European countries, and several smaller Asian economies. Establishment of an exchange rate pattern conducive to macroeconomic equilibrium <b>requires</b> substantial dollar <b>depreciation</b> and substantial appreciation of the renminbi and some other East Asian currencies like the Malaysian ringgit...|$|R

Bibliography: leaves [142]- 146. ix, 146 leaves illThe {{present study}} is an econometric {{investigation}} into Nepal's foreign sector. Its foreign trade presents Nepal with a unique problem. While {{the small size of}} the country impels Nepal to resort to international trade, its landlocked topography severely limits its option to trade with countries other than India. Trade with India thus presents itself to Nepal as a combined situation of monopoly and monopsony. In the present study, we have (a) constructed a structural model of the Nepalese foreign sector and estimated its parameters by using multivariate regression techniques, (b) projected Nepal's imports and exports for five years and examined the <b>required</b> exchange rate <b>depreciation</b> to rectify the projected trade deficits, (c) studied the effects on Indo-Nepal trade in the event of removal of trade treaties between the two nations, and finally, (d) suggested alternative trade policies. Lack of adequate data and the primitive state of the available data on Nepal have been the main reasons for the estimation of the functions in the model in highly aggregate form. Export demand and export supply functions have been disaggregated on the basis of end-use of the commodities. No disaggregation has been achieved in the import function. Single equation least-squares regression techniques have been used in the estimation of the model with annual data for 1960 / 61 to 1969 / 70. The usual objections to this method become less significant in this case {{because of the fact that}} a large number of the independent variables in the model are exogenous. The model consists of five structural equations and four identities. When data permit the construction of a model for the entire economy, the foreign trade model can be linked to a model of the domestic sector to take into account the inter-relationships and feedback between the two sectors. Contrary to what has been found in other studies on foreign trade, the relative price variable in our model has been consistently significant in import demand and export demand functions. Elasticity of Nepal's import demand has been found to be greater than unity with respect to income as well as to its import price. This suggests that decision makers can make use of expenditure-reducing and also expenditure-switching measures in formulating trade policies aimed to remedy the trade deficits. Nepal's export demand has been found to be relatively elastic with respect to the ratio of India's national income to its agricultural income; but with respect to its export price, the elasticity was below unity. The income elasticity of Nepal's export demand indicates susceptibility of its export earnings to India's agricultural condition. The low price elasticity of export demand gives scope for the Nepalese Government to impose export levies without their possible adverse effects on its export earnings. Nepal's elasticity of export supply with respect to Nepal's income was found to be substantially below unity while its elasticity with respect to its price was found to be greater than unity. Elasticities approach has been used in computing the <b>required</b> exchange rate <b>depreciation</b> to rectify the projected trade deficits of Nepal. The required rates ranged from 18 % to about 28 %. It has been found that in the event of mutual tariff imposition in each other's trade, in a static sense, Nepal's trade diversion losses in its trade with India are likely to be greater than the trade creations emanating from its free trade with India. Finally, we have examined the model in its performance in explaining the observed pattern and the accuracy of the structural estimates. The plots of each variable revealed the calculated and observed values of each variable moving convergently...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model designed {{to study the}} dynamic response of the economy under a fixed peg to the dollar to an international (and exogenous) real appreciation of the dollar, when there is wage and price stickiness, perfect capital mobility subject to sudden stops, and predominantly dollar denominated foreign debts with predominantly non-dollar trade. Assuming perfect foresight, we take the simple {{case in which the}} world is composed of the U. S. A., Europe, and Argentina and while all foreign debts are dollar denominated, all foreign trade is done with Europe. Hence, an important parameter in the model is the exogenous euro/dollar real exchange rate. PPP prevails in the export sector and there is monopolistically competitive price setting in the domestic sector and monopolistically competitive wage setting by households. Both are subject to adjustment cost functions that generate stickiness and domestic price and wage gaps, which result in "Phillips curve" equations for domestic prices and wages, respectively. Money demand is generated by a transactions technology. The first order conditions for firms and households under symmetric monopolistic competition equilibriums and the budget constraints result in a four dimensional dynamical system in the multilateral real exchange rate (MRER), the real wage, the rate of domestic price inflation and the rate of wage inflation. This system has a saddle-path stable equilibrium which is dependent on the marginal utility of wealth. Under the assumption that the economy is what is called a Domestically Biased Economy in Production relative to Consumption (DBE), it is seen that strong dollar shocks, which require an inter-temporally smoothened fall in consumption (and hence an increase in the marginal utility of wealth), have perverse impact effects. The peso appreciates in real terms and the real wage increases. These effects generate foreign indebtedness and increased vulnerability to (exogenous and unexpected) sudden stops. The DBE assumption essentially entails that real <b>depreciations</b> <b>require</b> reductions in the real wage to preserve (long run) labor market equilibrium. A story is developed to explain the main features of the functioning and ultimate collapse of Convertibility in Argentina, by assuming a strong dollar shock which is believed to be temporary and has the effect of generating unemployment, recession and debt accumulation. But before the new steady state is reached it is revealed that the shock is permanent, which triggers a sudden stop, a default, a devaluation, a debt restructuring, fiscal reform, and the return to capital market access. A more flexible exchange regime could avoid the debt accumulation that triggers the sudden stop, as well as the long period of unemployment, recession, and deflation...|$|R
40|$|WITH {{a second}} presidential victory, George Bush {{must deal with}} the {{problems}} created by his first term in office. Iraq is the most obvious and pressing and attracted most substantive attention during the campaign, along with irrelevancies like the candidates’ Vietnam War records, and the never-ending culture wars over issues like gay marriage. By contrast, the economy was barely an issue, a point illustrated by Bush’s gains in depressed manufacturing states like Ohio and Indiana. The US economy has managed a modest recovery since the 2001 recession, but only through an unsustainable growth in public and private consumption, reflected in the budget and trade deficits (it’s tempting to call them twin deficits, but the trade deficit grew steadily through the late 1990 s when the budget was in surplus). At 3. 6 per cent of GDP, the budget deficit is not huge for an economy that has still not recovered the ground lost during the 2001 recession, particularly with respect to employment. What is striking is the shift from solid surpluses in the late 1990 s to chronic deficits, with no credible plan to restore balance. When Bush took office in 2000, the Congressional Budget Office was predicting a cumulative budget surplus of $US 5. 6 trillion over the period 2001 - 10. Now, after deficits of $US 1. 2 trillion in Bush’s first term, the CBO projects cumulative deficits of $US 2. 3 trillion ($ 3. 1 trillion) over the next 10 years. A more realistic projection of current policy, allowing for Bush’s tax cuts being made permanent, and for expenditure growth in line with GDP, implies a cumulative deficit of $US 5 trillion, and public debt equal to 65 per cent of expected GDP. During the campaign, Bush claimed to have a plan to cut the deficit in half, but few took this seriously. Now, with no need to worry about re-election and with control of both Houses of Congress, he might introduce radical spending cuts. On past form, however, he will trust to luck and leave the deficit for his successor to deal with. An even bigger problem is the external deficit on trade in goods and services, which attracted hardly any attention during the campaign, except with regard to the peripheral issue of outsourcing. The fundamental problem is that the US has stopped saving. The household savings rate has fallen virtually to zero, while the public sector is in chronic deficit. As a result, even with relatively weak investment, it is necessary to borrow massively from abroad to finance current consumption. Private investors are increasingly unwilling to invest in US assets. The slack has been taken up by Asian central banks, most notably those of China and Japan. As yet, thanks to low interest rates, the deficit on the income account has remained modest, so that the current account deficit is only marginally greater than the trade deficit. But, as Australian experience shows, this is not a sustainable position. Continued trade deficits lead to a steadily growing net overseas debt and an accelerating current account deficit. As the late Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of Economic advisers under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, used to say, if a trend can’t be sustained, it won’t be. Since it’s impossible to run consistent large trade deficits, a return to balance is inevitable. But there’s nothing in Stein’s observation to suggest that the process of adjustment will be smooth, or pleasant. Even with a return to balance on the trade account over the next decade, the accumulation of debt would amount to about 80 per cent of GDP, implying a stable current account deficit of about 5 per cent of GDP. This is a sustainable position, but there is not much margin for error. Bringing exports and imports back into balance within ten years, and without a recession, will be a difficult task. It will <b>require</b> a further <b>depreciation</b> of the US dollar against the euro and yen, and an end to the pegged exchange rate with China. A steady depreciation will imply an increase in US interest rates, which is necessary in any case if household savings rates are to increase. The problem is to avoid the financial crisis that would arise if foreign lenders suddenly lost faith in US dollar assets. What is needed is a combination of short-term repairs to the budget and a coherent plan to deal with the long-term problems of Medicare and Social Security. There is no indication that Bush has such a plan, or even that he perceives the need for one.
