500|$|Mike Marqusee {{has written}} at length on the {{conflicts}} in Dylan's life during this time, with its deepening alienation from his old folk-revival audience and clear-cut leftist causes. He {{suggests that the}} song is probably self-referential: [...] "The song only attains full poignancy when one realises it is sung, at least in part, to the singer himself: he's the one 'with no direction home. Dylan himself has noted that, after his motorcycle accident in 1966, he realized that [...] "when I used words like 'he' and 'it' and 'they,' and talking about other people, I was <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> nobody but me." ...|$|E
500|$|With S.H.I.E.L.D. being {{announced}} {{as a legitimate}} organization again, after working in secret {{since the end of}} the series' first season, executive producer Jed Whedon said that the reaction to this would be mixed, as [...] "there are people who, as we see with the senator, are outspoken against Inhumans and will be against any form of protection for them. There are also people who are afraid. The idea of bringing S.H.I.E.L.D. back into the light is to ease their fears. So it’s going to be mixed." [...] Elaborating on this fear of Inhumans, Whedon said, [...] "the fun part about a genre TV show is you can speak in metaphor. There is a lot of fear of the other in our world right now. We get to do that with humans and Inhumans. We get to tackle those issues head-on without ever <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> them." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] is [...] "a romantic {{song about}} growing old" [...] {{according}} to singer Gruff Rhys. In {{an interview with}} British newspaper The Daily Telegraph Rhys discussed the song {{in the context of}} parent record Rings Around the World. The band abandoned the idea of making a [...] "save the world" [...] concept album as they reasoned that [...] "when people talk about saving the world they're <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> saving humans. The reality is that humans are the problem". [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] expands on this idea with Rhys stating that the song is about the extinction of the human race: [...] "maybe we'll all die but the world'll still be here, even if it's a dark, singed piece of rock flying around the sun". The track was recorded in 2000 at Bearsville Studios, Woodstock and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.|$|E

500|$|According to Saadiq, [...] "Just One Kiss" [...] can be {{interpreted}} as a song devoted to a female love interest, [...] "but I'm <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> music and what it did for me. That one guitar line, that certain drum beat, how it turned my life into a ball of gold." [...] The song incorporates cinematic strings, xylophone, and a rolling crescendo. The ballad [...] "Calling", featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R roots and doo-wop music, and incorporates Latin style guitar, and Spanish language lyrics. [...] "Staying in Love", an uptempo rhythm and blues song, was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex-girlfriend. Incongruous with its 1960s-inspired sound, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] has sexually forward lyrics and , which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest. The midtempo [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] is fashioned in Motown's early 1970 sound and, unlike other songs on the album, also incorporates elements from more modern soul music. [...] "Sometimes", which was inspired by Saadiq's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in Oakland, is about dealing with the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism. The line [...] "now I know what they meant by 'keep your head to the sky'" [...] makes reference to Earth, Wind & Fire, whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the song's message, [...] "That's just giving dap to my moms and grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time and sometimes we have to back up and cry but I'm just giving thanks to the people that helped me along the way." ...|$|E
2500|$|The pacing {{and rhythm}} of Howard Hawks' His Girl Friday {{was a big}} {{influence}} on the pictures style.

2500|$|It's {{impossible}} {{to translate the}} issue of the greed of Wall Street into one demand, or two demands. We're talking about a democratic awakening...you're talking about raising political consciousness so it spills over all parts of the country, so people can begin to see what's going on through a set of different lens, and then you begin to highlight what the more detailed demands would be. Because in the end we're <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> what Martin King would call a revolution: A transfer of power from oligarchs to everyday people of all colors. And that is a step by step process.|$|E

2500|$|... "No One" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Alicia Keys, Kerry Brothers Jr., and George M. Harry. Keys told MTV News Canada that the song [...] "is <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> {{the way that}} in relationships, the way that so many things are around {{you all the time}} to try to distract you. And even though people may talk and say whatever they may want to say, but then no one can {{get in the way of}} this." [...] Keys said that it was a song that [...] "just wrote itself".

2500|$|Selig's {{testimony}} {{on the subject}} has been contradictory. [...] In 2005, Selig told reporters, [...] "I never even heard about them [...] until 1998 or 1999. [...] I ran a team and nobody was closer to their players and I never heard any comment from them. [...] It wasn't until 1998 or ’99 that I heard the discussion." [...] But a year later, testifying to Congress in 2006, Selig claimed personal credit for spotting the problem early: [...] "In 1994, before anybody was <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> steroids in baseball, we proposed a program of testing for such substances to the MLBPA. [...] As early as 1998, I began formulating a strategic plan to eliminate the use of performance-enhancing substances from the game." [...] During the 1988 ALCS, Oakland's Jose Canseco had been repeatedly taunted by Boston fans with a chant of [...] "ster-oids, ster-oids, ster-oids." [...] Speaking at the 2013 All-Star Game, Selig complained, [...] "People say, ‘Well, you were slow to react.’ We were not slow to react. In fact, I heard that this morning, and it aggravated me all over again." ...|$|E

Look. I am putting the thing on the floor so that we shall be on--well--fairly equal terms. Even your sensitive Sukie could not be more considerate than that, could she? All I want to know is, what's inside that envelope? If you refuse to say, well and good. I shall retire to my maidenly couch and feed on the blackest suppositions." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lyrically, Taylor {{described}} it as a love song, stating [...] "'Song #3' is actually about a certain kind of love that I don’t think songwriters <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> It’s that strong passionate love but also that undying love. That really, really good s-t, you know?

50|$|This is {{no simple}} reform. It really is a revolution.

50|$|When {{quantities}} such as {{position and}} momentum are {{mentioned in the}} context of Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, it is essential {{to keep in mind that}} a statement such as pq ≠ qp does not refer to a single value of p and a single value q but to a matrix (grid of values arranged in a defined way) of values of position and a matrix of values of momentum.
