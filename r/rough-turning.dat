During turning a sort of bar code {{can be added to}} a workpiece by simply modifying its surface. The code can be written by using the same tool used for <b>rough-turning</b> or finishing, can be fully automatized and the new microtexture can be easily read along all the cylindrical surface. The written code involves a limited length and does not alter deeply the functional characteristic of the surface, while the wide lateral surface prevents the information to be lost as a consequence of dents and scratches...|$|E
