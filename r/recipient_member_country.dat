40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{numerous}} econometric studies have unearthed evidence of donor influence over the geographic distribution of funds from international financial institutions (IFIs). Scholars {{are now beginning to}} use quantitative methods to delve into the details of donor influence to understand better how IFIs function and to guide institutional reform. The evidence suggests that donors influence both the amount of funds committed (the number and size of loans) and the disbursement of committed funds. This paper advances the literature by applying stochastic frontier analysis to a novel data source to examine factors that affect how quickly World Bank projects proceed from identification to approval, i. e., {{how long it takes to}} prepare a project. Accelerated preparation is one explanation for how the World Bank might increase the number of loans to a <b>recipient</b> <b>member</b> <b>country</b> within a fixed time frame, for example in response to that country siding with powerful donor countries on important UN votes or while that country occupies an elected seat on the UN Security Council or the World Bank Executive Board.

In 2008, the euro zone will compass 15 out of 27 EU <b>member</b> <b>countries,</b> and the Schengen area is being expanded to include 22 <b>member</b> <b>countries.</b> The new <b>member</b> <b>countries</b> have already been able to benefit noticeably from {{their participation in the}} internal market, despite not yet fully integrated labour markets. The majority of the new <b>member</b> <b>countries</b> have grown faster than previously and have substantially increased their trade with the old <b>member</b> <b>countries.</b> As expected, the new <b>member</b> <b>countries</b> have benefited much more clearly from the most recent enlargement than the old <b>member</b> <b>countries.</b> Nevertheless, many problems remain yet to be solved: the income gap needs to be closed, the competitive position of the new <b>member</b> <b>countries</b> needs to be reinforced, and their economies need to be stabilised macroeconomically.

However, to avoid excessive financial burden on <b>member</b> <b>countries,</b> which accept nationals from other <b>member</b> <b>countries,</b> they are not responsible for providing social assistance benefits to jobless nationals of other member nations. In Germany, for example, such people do not receive basic security benefits provided to individuals seeking jobs (Hartz IV benefits). This treatment has become the object of debate.

40|$|The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), one of {{the main}} forces working for the {{integration}} of EEC <b>member</b> <b>countries,</b> generates an economic burden for each member which affects the balance of payments and the real income. This study assesses, for each <b>member</b> <b>country,</b> consumers’ transfers to the farmers of the other <b>member</b> <b>countries,</b> and calculates by how much imported and exported food prices are higher. The author establishes the net cost or benefit of the CAP to the balance of payments of each <b>member</b> <b>country,</b> i. e. the loss or gain of foreign exchange reserves. For simplicity, the methodology adopted assumes that there is no downward impact of the CAP on extra-EEC agricultural prices, which in its absence, would be higher. Results for each <b>member</b> <b>countries</b> are, therefore, not valid per se but in comparison with the results of the other <b>member</b> <b>countries.</b> Final results show that Italy bears the heaviest share of the burden.

40|$|Bank {{consolidation}} has substantially {{decreased the}} number of banks in European banking, which has had important implications for the banking sectors structure in all EU <b>member</b> <b>countries.</b> The consolidation processes have had {{a tremendous impact on}} the developments in banking sectors of new EU <b>member</b> <b>countries,</b> wheremajor structural changes have been initiated mostly by new entrant banks from the old EU <b>member</b> <b>countries.</b> The future banking development in new EU <b>member</b> <b>countries</b> will very likely follow some main patterns known from the old EU members. Rather speculative conjectures, which are based on a comparison with banking sectors in other EU <b>member</b> <b>countries</b> indicate, that the total-asset-to-GDPratio in new <b>member</b> <b>countries</b> should further improve in the future. The banking sector growth will be based mostly on the growth of the credit to non-banking sector, while banks are not expected anymore to use non-bank deposits as a predominant way of funding. Instead potentials for alternative funding possibilities should be activated. Although the non-bank financial intermediaries in new EU membersrepresent a serious competition to banks, their relative underdevelopment prevents them from impacting the developments in banking sectors as known from old EU <b>member</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|R
