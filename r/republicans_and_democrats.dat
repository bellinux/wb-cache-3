5|$|Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a US bipartisan defense and foreign policy consensus between <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> focused on containment and deterrence that weakened during and after the Vietnam War, but ultimately persisted thereafter. Moderate and conservative parties in Europe, as well as social democrats, gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance, while European and American Communists, financed by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations, adhered to Moscow's line, although dissent began to appear after 1956. Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the anti-nuclear movement.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Territory of Hawaii in 1900, White {{became a member of the}} Home Rule Party, which was formed by the former leaders of Hui Aloha ʻĀina and Hui Kālaiʻāina. The party consisted of Native Hawaiians who had been leaders during the monarchy and other former royalists and loyalists such as Robert William Wilcox, who was elected the first congressional delegate from Hawaii under the Home Rule ticket. During this period, the party would share the political stage and contend with the <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, {{because of}} {{political}} infighting between Liberal <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats,</b> and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley {{was no match for}} Grant, who won in a landslide. Grant won 286 of the 352 Electoral College votes, and received 55.8 {{percent of the popular vote}} nationwide. The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into both house of Congress. Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign, Greeley died a few weeks after the election. Out of respect for Greeley, Grant attended his funeral.|$|E

5|$|Houston is {{considered}} to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often sways between <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Much of the city's wealthier areas vote Republican while the city's working class and minority areas vote Democratic. According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey, 68percent of non-Hispanic whites in Harris County are declared or favor Republicans while 89 percent of non-Hispanic blacks in the area are declared or favor Democrats. About 62percent of Hispanics (of any race) in the area are declared or favor Democrats. The city has often been known to be the most politically diverse city in Texas, a state known for being generally conservative. As a result, the city is often a contested area in statewide elections. In 2009, Houston became the first US city with a population over 1 million citizens to elect a gay mayor, by electing Annise Parker.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 1861, Morton {{addressed}} {{a special session}} of the Indiana General Assembly to obtain the legislature's approval to borrow and spend funds to purchase arms and supplies for Indiana's troops. Morton also urged Indiana's legislators to set aside party considerations {{for the duration of}} the war and unite in defense of the Union, but the <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> did not cooperate for long. Initially, the Democratic-controlled legislature was supportive of Morton's measures and passed the legislation he requested. After the state legislature adjourned in May, however, some of the state's prominent Democrats changed their opinion about the war. In January 1862 the Democrats clarified their position at a state convention chaired by Thomas Hendricks. Indiana's Democrats stated that their support for the integrity of the Union and the war effort, but opposed emancipation of black and the abolition of slavery.|$|E

5|$|The {{war effort}} {{was the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions {{on both sides of the}} aisle, such as the appointment of <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|When the {{legislature}} convened on February 19, {{two sets of}} officers attempted to preside. Marshall and Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, both claimed the right to preside over the state senate. Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising any authority in the senate; Beckham counter-sued for possession of the capitol and executive building. The cases were consolidated, and both <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> agreed to let the courts decide the election. On March 10, a circuit court found in favor of Beckham and the Democrats. By a 6–1 vote, the Kentucky Court of Appeals, the state's court of last resort at the time, upheld the circuit court's decision on April 6, legally unseating Taylor and Marshall. The case of Taylor v. Beckham was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, but the court refused {{to intervene in the}} case because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E
