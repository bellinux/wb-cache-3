40|$|To {{elucidate}} the structure–antioxidant activity relationships <b>of</b> chitosan gallate (<b>CG),</b> a series <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> derivatives with {{different degrees of}} substitution (DS’s) and molecular weights (MWs) were synthesized from chitosan (CS) and gallic acid (GA) via a free radical graft reaction. A higher MW led to a lower DS <b>of</b> <b>CG.</b> The structures <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> were characterized by FT-IR and 1 H NMR, and results showed that GA was mainly conjugated to the C- 2 and C- 6 positions of the CS chain. The antioxidant activity (the DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power) were enhanced with an increased DS and a decreased MW <b>of</b> <b>CG.</b> A correlation between antioxidant activities and the DS and MW <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> was also established. In addition, a suitable concentration (0 ~ 250 μg/mL) <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> with different MWs (32. 78 ~ 489. 32 kDa) and DS’s (0 ~ 92. 89 mg·GAE/g CG) has no cytotoxicity.

40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to analyse in vitro and in vivo activities <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> 400549, a new FabI inhibitor, against clinical isolates of staphylococci. The mode <b>of</b> action <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> 400549 and resistance mechanism of Staphylococcus aureus against CG 400549 were also investigated by genetic approaches. Methods: In vitro activity <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> 400549 was evaluated by the 2 -fold agar dilution method as described by the CLSI, and {{compared with those of}} oxacillin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, vancomycin, linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. In vivo activity <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> 400549 was deter-mined against systemic infections in mice. Time–kill curves <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> 400549 were analysed at concen-trations of 13, 23 and 43 MIC against S. aureus strains. Results: CG 400549 had the lowest MICs among the test compounds against 238 clinical isolates of S. aureus (MIC 90, 0. 25 mg/L) and 51 clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC 90, 1 mg/L). The activity <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> 400549 was irrespective of whether the strains were methicillin-susceptible or-resistant. Furthermore, CG 400549 was effective by oral or subcutaneous administration against systemic infections in mice. In a time–kill study, CG 400549 at concentrations of 13 MIC, 23 MIC and 43 MIC had a bacterio-static activity during 24 h. A FabI-overexpressing S. aureus strain gave rise to an increase in the MIC <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> 400549 compared with the parental strain, while the susceptibilities of the FabI-overexpressin...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Wenchuan {{earthquake}} in China caused shock and grief worldwide. Sudden bereavement {{caused by the}} earthquake led to physical disorders as well as psychological disturbances in the bereaved individuals. The bereaved had a high risk for complicated grief (CG), which {{may have led to}} significant distress and impairment in their health. However, there was few available studies on CG among disaster-bereaved individuals in China after the disaster. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify factors (demographic characteristics and disaster-related variables) associated with symptoms <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> among the bereaved 18 months after the Wenchuan earthquake. Methods: This study was conducted with a cross-sectional design and a convenience sample of 271 bereaved individuals from three of the hardest hit areas. Data were collected by questionnaires and the instruments used in the study were: General questionnaire and Inventory <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> (ICG). Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with symptoms <b>of</b> <b>CG.</b> Results: The mean score on ICG was 52. 77 (standard deviation: 10. 00). Being female and loss of a child were related to higher level <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> while having another child after the disaster and receiving psychological counseling experience were associated with lower level <b>of</b> <b>CG.</b> Forty-nine percent <b>of</b> the variance <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> was explained by these identified factors. Conclusions: Eighteen months after the Wenchuan earthquake, the symptoms <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> among the bereaved were higher than the previous studies with bereaved individuals. This study uncovers a vulnerable population of the bereaved at high risk for CG. Early assessments, targeted interventions, and policy support tailored for the disaster-bereaved individuals are necessary to identify and alleviate symptoms <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> and to improve their well-being...|$|R

Metabolite profiles indicated that vabicaserin was extensively metabolized via carbamoyl glucuronidation after oral adminis-tration in humans. In the present study, the differences in the extent of vabicaserin carbamoyl glucuronide (CG) formation in humans and in animals used for safety assessment were inves-tigated. After oral dosing, the systemic exposure ratios <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> to vabicaserin were approximately 12 and up to 29 in monkeys and humans, respectively, and the ratios <b>of</b> <b>CG</b> to vabicaserin were approximately 1. 5 and 1. 7 in mice and dogs, respectively.

Previous researches in other countries have reported that parents as caregivers (<b>CGs)</b> <b>of</b> children with disability have mental health problems, but the actual situation has not been examined nationwide in Japan so far. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the association between mental health <b>of</b> <b>CGs</b> who had children with disability and characteristics <b>of</b> children, <b>CGs,</b> and household based on the nation-wide survey.
