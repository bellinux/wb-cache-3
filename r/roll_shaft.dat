To solve this problem, changing the blank shape and size were tried. Two types of concave conical and round blanks are designed with concave conical blanks obtained by rolling in the cross wedge rolling. Because {{the design of the}} rolling die is simple, good precision of blank can be ensured. Multiple size types of blanks were designed and the rolling experiment was made in the rolling mill of model H 630. By measuring the values of the tooth height and pitch, the effect of blank shape on thread <b>shafts</b> <b>rolled</b> in the wedge rolling were investigated carefully. The reasonable size range of the blank shape was obtained. The conclusions above pave the theoretical foundation for the in-depth study on this technology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The study {{focuses on}} the design and {{fabrication}} of a coconut husk mini-chipper machine which can contribute and {{improve the lives of}} farmers and the competitiveness of micro-scale coconut industries particularly in rural areas. The machine is connected into a cold <b>roll</b> <b>shaft</b> and utilizes a 6 hp diesel engine generator. This is used to produce chips out of coconut husk and utilized as a potting medium for gardeners and orchids enthusiasts. This has been developed to further improve the utilization of the coconut husks into a productive used which are commonly ignored by most of the farmers in the rural areas. By adapting this machine, farmers can earn more from coconut husks and become competitive in coconut husk industries. The average coconut husks processed by the mini-chipper machine is 282 pcs in an hour while the volume of coconut husk chips produced has an average of 155 kilogram in an hour. The diesel used for an hour is 0. 72 liters Normally, the 282 pcs of coconut husks should have an approximate weight of 169 kg but from the data above it produced 155 kg which is almost 92 % chips and 8 % waste or dust. This proves that the machine is efficient. (Note: average weight of coconut husk in Lucban, Quezon is about 0. 6 kg). The machine obtained an overall acceptability mean rating of 4. 9 and interpreted as Very Highly Acceptable. It means that Mini-Chipper is technically and operationally acceptable. This machine is considered very useful and significant to the end users specifically to the farmers who can earn more profit from processed coconut husks...|$|E

As they enter the deepest part of the mine shaft, they {{discover}} the butchered body of Goro laying {{on the floor of the}} mine. As they approach, the giant insect emerges and chases the men back up the mine shaft. Even worse, the thing seems impervious to any kind of gunfire. Taking action, Shigeru releases the mine cart, which <b>rolls</b> down the <b>shaft</b> and collides with the insect, crushing it. When the men venture back into the shaft to remove Goro's body, Shigeru is threatened by another giant insect. The soldiers fire at it with no effect; but an earthquake strikes and the tunnel begins to cave in, killing the insect and trapping Shigeru in the mine.|$|R

This paper presents {{a case study of}} the world‟s first operational underground gravity gold plant at the former Gwynfynydd mine and innovation leading to a new „Python ‟ modular underground system. The Gwynfynydd mine is located in north Wales, United Kingdom. In response to the environmental constraints of being located within a National Park, the operator designed and built a mill underground based on physical separation. Many gold ores liberate favourably using fine-crushing techniques such as High Pressure Grinding <b>Rolls</b> or Vertical <b>Shaft</b> Impactor. Using comminution circuits for mineral liberation, rather than for final recovery process, and by utilising a relatively high-mass pull high-recovery process route, the Python pre-concentration plant was developed for underground operation with a capacity of 20 tonnes per hour. The Gekko Python is currently operating at the Central Rand gold project in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|By {{designing}} comminution circuits for mineral liberation {{rather than}} the final recovery process and by using high mass pull gravity recovery, the concept of underground processing has become a reality. Gekko has found that many ores respond favourably to fine crushing with either high pressure grinding <b>rolls</b> or vertical <b>shaft</b> impactors which when combined with the inline pressure jig gravity separator and coarse flotation results in a narrow, low-head, compact processing plant that can be sensibly fitted in existing underground openings. The focus on fine crushing reduces the power requirements of the plant to approximately 5 kWh/t for a capacity of up to 20 t/h run of mine ore feed. The use of water recycle systems places no extra load on the mine’s normal water handling system. Gekko’s underground processing plant, the ‘Python’, {{has been designed to}} be towed down the decline or lowered down a shaft and is capable of being installed in sloping, non-linear drives for placement close to the working face. The overall benefit to mining companies of this concept has been estimated to be a significant operating cost-saving, lower cut-off grade and a significantly smaller environmental footprint...|$|R

40|$|Complementary to the {{established}} techniques to evaluate stress states, electromagnetic and ultrasonic techniques permit {{the evaluation of}} stresses in surface layers and in the bulk of components, respectively. One advantage of these techniques {{is the possibility of}} a fast evaluation of stress states, enabling a continuous analysis along traces to get an information about the stress distribution and the stress inhomogeneities. A disadvantage of both techniques is the influence of changes of micro structural states on the measuring quantities. In case of the electromagnetic techniques, calibrations have to be done, using representative samples in tensile test experiments. The quantitative evaluation of stress states using ultrasonic techniques assumes the knowledge of the acousto-elastic constants. The influence of the micro structural state on the electromagnetic and acousto-elastic quantities has been studied. Depending on e. g. the steel grade, the hardness, the welding parameters, the micro structural state as well as the texture differs. It is found that the texture and micro structural influence on the acousto-elastic constants is not as significant as it was expected. Applying multiple regression algorithms on the electromagnetic quantities, the microstructural states influence can be suppressed. Results of ultrasonic and/or electromagnetic stress analysis on rolled plates, in and around welds, along the length of <b>rolls</b> and gear <b>shafts</b> and along a part of a pipeline were mapped. Comparisons with the results of an establishes technique show the reliable application of both techniques. The presentation describes the experimental results and discusses the applicability of the electromagnetic and ultrasonic technique and the benefits of the measurements over large areas of the component...|$|R
40|$|Proposed in {{this study}} is a {{metallic}} isolator utilizing two orthogonal roller layers to realize the bidirectional isolation. One of the advantages of the proposed metallic isolator is the low friction coefficient to realize a long period. The other is the large tension resistance in the vertical direction. These features make it easy to be used in high-rise buildings. The metallic isolator consists of top and bottom plats, two layers of rolling shafts, a middle plat, L-shaped anti-tension connecting plates, and PTFE plates. When being compressed, the rolling <b>shafts</b> <b>roll</b> {{on the surface of the}} middle plate, providing very low friction force. While being tensioned, a sliding mechanism forms between the L-shaped anti-tension connecting plats and PTFE plates, and the isolation effect depends on the friction coefficient of the contact pairs. By virtue of the two roller layers set in orthogonal directions, the top plate is able to move in any horizontal direction relative to the bottom plate. The mechanical properties of the new base isolation device are investigated experimentally. The isolator was tested under the compression from 100 kN to 1000 kN. Several horizontal loading directions were selected as 0, 30 and 45 degrees to simulate the motion in any horizontal direction. The loading frequency changed from 0. 05 Hz to 0. 3 Hz with the amplitude varying from 20 mm to 150 mm. It is demonstrated that the metallic isolator is able to move smoothly in any direction with a relatively constant coefficient ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 04. The dependency on the vertical compression and the horizontal velocity is quite low and the mechanical property is stable and reliable...|$|R
40|$|Torsional {{vibration}} of drive <b>shafts,</b> <b>rolls,</b> {{and vertical}} vibration of rolling mill housings due to impact rolling loads {{should be considered}} because they can shorten the lives of rolling mill components. Moreover these dynamic loads can affect the quality and physical properties of the strip. This thesis contains the simulation of different vibration modes in a hot Roughing mill which consists of a Horizontal mill with an attached Edger (Fig. 5. 1). Four vibrations of the Roughing Mill system have been studied: (i) torsional vibration of Horizontal mill (ii) vertical vibration of Horizontal mill (iii) torsional vibration of Vertical Edger (iv) horizontal vibration of slab between the two mills. There are many published works on torsional and vertical vibration of rolling mills especially for cold rolling. In their simulations, the vibrations were calculated with the excitation of a step or ramp-step function, {{but they did not}} consider the oscillation of rolling force and torques caused by the rolls having different velocities due to torsional vibration under asymmetrical rolling conditions. However, the following parameters have been taken into account when calculating the vibration in this thesis: (i) asymmetry in horizontal mill (different roll speed) (ii) variation of rolling force and torques (top and bottom rolls) in horizontal mill (iii) backlash on the drives couplings (iv) non-linear stiffness and damping of hot slab (v) push-pull between the two mills during interaction conditions The study showed that the asymmetry and slab vertical damping introduced the greatest damping on the torsional and vertical vibration of horizontal mill respectively. Moreover, higher vibrations amplitudes achieved in both mills as a result of backlash on shafts or push-pull between the two mills. Stability and torsional vibration of horizontal mill for different slippage conditions also been investigated. The self-excited vibration (continual slippage when the torque is replaced by a friction torque) introduced the highest amplitude compared with normal slippage (no torque for a short time) ...|$|R
5000|$|Pavel Tretyakov started {{collecting}} art in {{the middle}} of 1850. The founding year of the Tretyakov Gallery is considered to be 1856, when Tretyakov purchased two paintings of Russian artists: Temptation by N.G. Schilder and Skirmish with Finnish Smugglers by V.G. Kudyakov, although earlier, in 1854-1855, he had bought 11 graphic sheets and 9 pictures of old Dutch masters. In 1867 the Moscow City Gallery of Pavel and Sergei Tretyakov was opened. The Gallery’s collection consisted of 1,276 paintings, 471 sculptures and 10 drawings of Russian artists, as well as 84 paintings by foreign masters. In August 1892 Tretyakov presented his art gallery to the city of Moscow as a gift. In the collection at this time, there were 1,287 paintings and 518 graphic works of the Russian school, 75 paintings and 8 drawings of European schools, 15 sculptures and a collection of icons. The official opening of the museum called the Moscow City Gallery of Pavel and Sergei Tretyakov took place on August 15, 1893. The gallery was located in a mansion that the Tretykov family had purchased in 1851. As the Tretyakov collection of art grew, the residential part of the mansion filled with art and it became necessary to make additions to the mansion in order to store and display the works of art. Additions were made in 1873, 1882, 1885, 1892 and 1902-1904, when there was the famous facade, designed in 1900-1903 by architect V. Bashkirov from the drawings of the artist Viktor Vasnetsov. Construction of the façade was managed by the architect A.M. Kalmykov. In early 1913, the Moscow City Duma elected Igor Grabar as a trustee of the Tretyakov Gallery. On June 3, 1918, the Tretyakov Gallery was declared owned by Russian Federated Soviet Republic and was named the State Tretyakov Gallery. Igor Grabar was again appointed director of the museum. With Grabar’s active participation in the same year, the State Museum Fund was created, which up until 1927 remained {{one of the most important}} sources of replenishment of the gallery's collection. In 1926 architect and academician A.V. Shchusev became the director of the gallery. In the following year the gallery acquired the neighboring house on Maly Tolmachevsky Lane (the house was the former home of the merchant Sokolikov). After restructuring in 1928, it housed the gallery's administration, academic departments, library, manuscripts department, and funds and graphics staffs. In 1985-1994, an administrative building was built from the design of architect A.L. Bernstein with two floors and height equal to that of the exposition halls. In 1928 serious renovations were made to the gallery to provide heating and ventilation. In 1929 electricity was installed. In 1929 the church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi was closed, and in 1932 the building was given to the gallery and became a storage facility for paintings and sculptures. Later, the church was connected to the exposition halls and a top floor was built which was specially designed for exhibiting a painting by A.A. Ivanov,The Appearance of Christ to the People (1837-1857). A transition space was built between rooms located on either side of the main staircase. This ensured the continuity of the view of exposure. The gallery began to develop a new concept of accommodating exhibits. In 1936, a new two floor building was constructed which is located on the north side of the main building - it is known as the Schusevsky building. These halls were first used for exhibitions, and since 1940 have been included in the main route of exposure. From the first days of the Great War, the gallery's personnel began dismantling the exhibition, as well as those of other museums in Moscow, in preparation for evacuating during wartime. Paintings were <b>rolled</b> on wooden <b>shafts,</b> covered with tissue paper, placed in boxes, and sheathed with waterproof material. In the middle of the summer of 1941 a train of 17 wagons traveled from Moscow and brought the collection to Novosibirsk. The gallery was not reopened in Moscow until May 17, 1945, upon the conclusion of the Great War. In 1956, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Tretyakov Gallery, the Alexander Ivanov Hall was completed. From 1980-1992, the director of the Tretyakov Gallery was Y.K. Korolev. Because of the increased number of visitors, Korolev was actively engaged in expanding the area of exposition. In 1983, construction work began to expand the gallery. In 1985 the Depository, a repository of works of art and restoration workshops, was commissioned. In 1986 renovations began on the main building of the Tretyakov Gallery. The architects I.M. Vinogradsky, G.V. Astafev, B.A. Klimov and others were retained to perform this project. In 1989, on the south side of the main building, a new building was designed and constructed to house a conference hall, a computer and information center, children's studio and exhibition halls. The building was named the [...] "Corps of Engineers", because it housed engineering systems and services. From 1986 to 1995, the Tretyakov Gallery in Lavrushinsky Lane was closed to visitors to accommodate a major renovation project to the building. At the time, the only museum in the exhibition area of this decade was the building on the Crimean Val, 10, which in 1985 was merged with the Tretyakov Gallery.|$|R
