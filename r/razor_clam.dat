500|$|The diamond {{stingray}} is {{most active}} at night, spending {{much of the}} day buried in sand with only its eyes protruding. When foraging for food, it may be solitary but more commonly forms groups numbering up to the hundreds. There is strong segregation by sex and age. This species feeds on crustaceans, molluscs, and other invertebrates, as well as small bony fishes; its powerful jaws and molar-like teeth allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. It mainly targets burrowing organisms, but may also take prey exposed on the bottom. There is a record of a female [...] across, that had gorged herself on at least 30 small crabs. In the Bahía Magdalena lagoon complex, Baja California Sur, its most important source of food are pea crabs, followed by the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> Solyema valvulus, and then polychaete worms.|$|E
500|$|Razor shells can dig {{themselves}} into the sand with great speed to escape predation. When a Pacific <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> (Siliqua patula) is laid {{on the surface of}} the beach it can bury itself completely in seven seconds [...] and the Atlantic jackknife clam, Ensis directus, can do the same within fifteen seconds. Scallops and file clams can swim by opening and closing their valves rapidly; water is ejected on either side of the hinge area and they move with the flapping valves in front. Scallops have simple eyes around the margin of the mantle and can clap their valves shut to move sharply, hinge first, to escape from danger. Cockles can use their foot to move across the seabed or leap away from threats. The foot is first extended before being contracted suddenly when it acts like a spring, projecting the animal forwards.|$|E
2500|$|Cordova {{was also}} once {{the home of}} a booming <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> industry, and between 1916 and the late 1950s it was known as the [...] "Razor Clam Capital of the World". [...] Commercial harvest in the area was as much as 3.5 million pounds. Returns began declining in the late 1950s, presumably due to overharvesting and a large die-off in 1958. The 1964 Good Friday {{earthquake}} effectively and completely obliterated the industry; in some areas, the ground was thrust up by as much as six feet, exposing the already depleted clam beds. There has been no commercial harvest in the area since 1988 {{with the exception of a}} brief harvest in 1993.|$|E
50|$|Pacific <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> {{are highly}} {{desirable}} and edible, collected both commercially and by recreational harvesters. <b>Razor</b> <b>clams,</b> like other shellfish, may sometimes accumulate dangerous levels of domoic acid, a marine toxin. Harvesters should {{be sure to}} check current public health recommendations before collecting <b>razor</b> <b>clams.</b> <b>Razor</b> <b>clams</b> are commonly battered and fried in butter, or made into a clam chowder.|$|R

60|$|I {{found one}} stone {{on the top}} of the bank, of a dark gray color, shaped exactly like a giant clam (Mactra solidissima), and of the same size; and, what was more remarkable, {{one-half}} of the outside had shelled off and lay near it, of the same form and depth with one of the valves of this clam, while the other half was loose, leaving a solid core of a darker color within it. I afterward saw a stone resembling a <b>razor</b> <b>clam,</b> but it was a solid one. It appeared as if the stone, in the process of formation, had filled the mould which a clam-shell furnished; or the same law that shaped the clam had made a clam of stone. Dead clams, with shells full of sand, are called sand clams. There were many of the large clamshells filled with sand; and sometimes one valve was separately filled exactly even, as if it had been heaped and then scraped. Even, among the many small stones {{on the top of}} the bank, I found one arrow-head.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Razor</b> <b>Clam</b> {{harvesting}} {{is typically}} authorized by state officials {{several times a}} year.

50|$|Rengginang can be plain, or {{flavoured}} sweet, salty or savoury. The {{most common}} rengginang are deep fried with added pinches of salt for a traditional salty taste.

50|$|Solecurtus strigilatus, {{commonly}} known as the rosy <b>razor</b> <b>clam,</b> is a species of saltwater clam, a marine bivalve mollusc in the family Solecurtidae.
