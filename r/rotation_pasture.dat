40|$|A {{study on}} {{artificial}} pasture {{was conducted in}} the experimental field of a private farm Aydin/Turkey which was under typical Mediterranean climatic conditions, during 2002 - 2009. Some promising legumes in this environment (Medicago sativa, Lotus corniculatus, Trifolium resupinatum) and some grasses (Bromus inermis, Dactylis glomerata, Festuca arundinace, Arrhenatherum elatius) as well as Sanguisorba minor were sown as a mixture. Stand yield characteristics and crop performances of sward were tested for 7 yrs under cattle grazing. The results indicated the adverse effects of Mediterranean climate {{and to some extent}} grazing on yield and cover characteristics of some mixture crop material, particularly T. resupinatum, B. inermis and D. glomerata. On the contrary, F. arundinacea, M. sativa, A. elatius and L. corniculatus displayed higher contributions to total yield. The most crucial handicap of the Turkish animal husbandry sector is to provide cheap and high quality roughage to farms. Since the roughage costs are generally 70 % of expenditure in animal production, there is an urgent need to improve grasslands. Remembering the Mediterranean conditions of Western Turkey which allows favourable crop growth, it must be emphasized that any attempt to benefit from alternatives of new forage crop introductions is of vital significance. Artificial pasture (<b>rotation</b> <b>pasture)</b> establishments under field conditions in the area may be one of those attempts to promote roughage production. It should be also emphasized that number of alternative warm or cool season grasses productive and persistent under Mediterranean climate are quite limited compared to humid continental climates. The objective {{of this study was to}} practice a promising artificial pasture mixture and to test new crop cultivars under a grazing regime for long-term use in the region...|$|E
40|$|In the past, in some wheat growing {{areas of}} Victoria, {{particularly}} the Wimmera, {{there has been}} almost total reliance on wheat, other enterprises filling a minor role in the farming system. With the introduction of wheat delivery quotas in April 1969, farm operators were faced with a sudden drop in income. The cost-price squeeze has aggravated the income problem. A typical Wimmera Plains wheat farm of 625 acres is small by Australian standards, but {{it has the potential}} to produce 7, 500 bushels of wheat, or more, under a fertility-maintaining rotation. In 1970 - 71, however, farms of this size had, on average, a quota of only 4, 700 bushels. The possible level of gross income from wheat has been reduced by between $ 400 and $ 3, 000 per annum, depending on the comparative profitability of alternative enterprises to wheat. The aim of the study was to investigate two important aspects of the farm adjustment problem on the Wimmera Plains; firstly, the best use of resources released from wheat production, and secondly, the potential for adjustment towards optimal resource combinations. A sample of 20 farms, chosen at random from a population of 129, was surveyed in May and June, 1970. The data collected, together with information supplied by the Victorian Department of Agriculture, provided farm planning coefficients. Because of the relatively homogeneous nature of farms with respect to resource complements and enterprise possibilities, the representative farm model approach was considered to be satisfactory for the examination of farm adjustment possibilities on the Wimmera Plains. Using a representative model, linear programming was used to generate profit-maximising farm plans. Variable price programming was used to study the effect of commodity price changes on income. Because of the dominating importance of feed grains in plans, and uncertainty about their prices, enterprise combinations were studied at both "high" and "low" feed-grain prices. To substantiate the results generated for the representative farm model, five of the sample farms were studied individually. When only the "traditional" enterprises (cereals and sheep) were considered, planning results suggested that the five course <b>rotation,</b> <b>pasture,</b> fallow, crop, fallow, crop, with winter-lambing Merino ewes, is the maximum profit plan at both "high" and "low" feed grain prices. Wheat is grown to the level of quota and barley is grown on the remaining cropped area. Income from livestock is minor relative to crop income, providing only 15 to 30 per cent of total gross margin. However, several alternative (or "new') enterprises which are not vet commonly practised in the area were found to offer considerable promise. Oilseed crops, especially oilseed rape, are profitable alternatives to barley, particularly at low feed-grain prices. Even at the current relatively high feed grain prices, and assuming a conservative yield, rapeseed has the potential to lift income from the 625 acre representative farm model by up to $ 700 per annum. More experience is required with oilseed crops in the area before firm recommendations can be made. Beef cattle, grain feeding of beef, and pigs, can also contribute to increased farm income. Cattle compete directly with sheep for feed, but pigs can be integrated into the existing farming system using farm-grown barley and surplus operator labour. The returns to capital investment in the cattle and pig enterprises were found to be favourable, especially in the case of pigs. If the necessary capital is to be borrowed, however, it is unlikely that there will be surplus disposable income from cattle enterprises during a ten-year repayment period. Gains to the individual farmer from wheat quota negotiability were investigated. The five case-study farms were considered as a "mini-market" for wheat quota under perfect competition. Assuming that the five operators bought or sold quota in order to maximise their income, the average theoretical gain per farm, from negotiability, was between $ 100 and $ 200 per annum, depending on the price of barley. In the theoretical quota market seven thousand bushels of wheat quota were exchanged between the five farms. The return to labour and management which is possible on the typical 625 acre Wimmera Plains farm was found to be below an "acceptable" level of $ 3, 500 per annum. However, at current land values, which have fallen substantially since 1968, the purchase or lease of additional land by typical farmers seems to be profitable. Results indicated that the machinery and labour capacity of the "typical" 625 acre property was sufficient to effectively farm more than 1, 000 acres. Eleven per cent of the 129 farms in the Wimmera study area were found to be smaller than 500 acres in size. For such farms, additional land as well as additional quota would probably be necessary for viability, at least at low feed-grain prices.

40|$|Sequestration of {{atmospheric}} carbon in agricultural soils {{in the form}} of soil organic carbon (SOC) can help fight climate change and improve soil fertility. This can be achieved by changing current agricultural management practices to new practices that store more carbon in the soil. Two promising practices are no-tillage and crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation.</b> This thesis evaluated the combined effect of these two practices by comparing no-tillage continuous cropping, no-tillage crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> with a short (two year) pasture phase and no-tillage crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> with a long (four year) pasture phase and their on the level of soil organic carbon in the unfractionated soil and the soil fractions coarse particulate organic matter (coarse POM), fine particulate organic matter (fine POM) and mineral associated organic matter (MAOM). Additionally it tried to measure the C:N (carbon to nitrogen) ratios to confirm and explain possible enhanced humification under no-tillage short and long crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> (from here on all mentioned treatments were performed without tillage unless stated otherwise). The samples were taken at 0 - 5 cm, 5 - 10 cm and 10 - 20 cm depth at an eighteen year old experimental site at Paysandu (Uruguay) on a Typic Agriudoll. The carbon and nitrogen measurements were performed with dry combustion and factorial mixed ANOVA was used for the statistical analysis. Significant differences between the three agricultural practices were only found in the 5 - 10 cm layer in the coarse and total POM-C (‘-C’ refers to the carbon in the fraction) fractions. This confirms that total POM-C and especially coarse POM-C are sensitive to changes in agricultural management. Crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> with a four year pasture phase had the highest coarse POM-C concentration (0. 34 g/kg), followed by the short crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> with a two year pasture phase (0. 26 g/kg) and continuous cropping with the lowest carbon level (0. 20 g/kg). For total POM-C the concentrations were 0. 90 g/kg for long crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation,</b> 0. 62 g/kg for short crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> and 0. 58 g/kg for continuous cropping. So in the sensitive SOM fractions in the 5 - 10 cm layer long crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> had the highest SOC level, followed by short crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> and continuous cropping with the lowest SOC level. There were differences between the total SOC concentrations of the three rotation systems, but they were not significant. The experiment needs more time for the effects to accumulate. That total SOC concentrations will keep accumulating in the coming years is indicated by the significant changes in the sensitive coarse and total POM-C fractions. Based on comparable scientific literature, it is estimated that sequestration at the experimental site will take place for about 22 more years and that the current changes will double. The pasture phases of short and long crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> had several significantly higher SOC concentrations in the soil fractions than the cropping phases. This supports that under no-tillage pastures {{have a positive effect on}} the carbon level. Furthermore long crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> had higher coarse and total POM-C concentrations than short crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> and the fourth year of pasture also had significantly higher concentrations than the second year of pasture of long crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation.</b> So a long (four year) pasture phase included in a crop rotation system is thus better regarding coarse and total POM-C concentrations than a short (two year) pasture phase. It was not possible to confirm the occurrence of enhanced humification under short and long crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> because the nitrogen measurement failed. The recommendations for future research are measuring nitrogen to confirm enhanced humification under the crop <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> systems, measuring the carbon saturation deficit to know more about the future development of the SOC level, using the fractionation method again, because it yielded significant results and using at least three replications to get significant result from the 0 - 5 cm layer and fine POM-C...|$|R

40|$|A {{questionnaire}} survey regarding endoparasite control practices in Danish horse herds {{was carried out}} in 1995. The participating veterinarians and herd owners were sampled using convenience and purposive sampling. In the analysis of risk factors for development of a high endoparasitic burden (> 200 eggs per gram faeces) 903 horses were sampled and the analysis of the efficiency of a single anthelmintic treatment was based on 605 horses. The following factors had a significant effect on the endoparasitic burden: herd type, age of the horses, use of <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation,</b> anthelmintic treatment of horses visiting the herd, use of an adviser in the planning of endoparasite control and advice regarding <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation.</b> An interaction between <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> and advice regarding <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> was found, but due to high collinearity this was not reported.

Abstract Land {{management}} {{practices such as}} irrigation, crop rotation and crop type affect soil properties. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the effect of common land {{management practices}} in western Kentucky including non-irrigated, irrigated, and pasture ground on selected soil properties. Undisturbed and disturbed soil samples were collected from two fields in each of the three locations, from the depth of 1 - 3 inches and 3 - 6 inches. The fields in Princeton, KY were double crop soybeans in a no-till operation. In Simpson County, the fields were planted in corn, on a no-till operation and the field in Ohio County, KY was a non-irrigated pasture for grazing purposes. Soil samples in Princeton, KY were taken on September 8 th and in Simpson County, KY, samples were collected on September 16 th, 2017 due to flooding issues. In addition, soil samples in Ohio County, KY were taken on September 9 th, 2017.

40|$|One of the {{assumptions}} underlying efforts to convert cropping land, especially marginal crop land, to plantations {{is that there will}} be a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, with a gas 'sink' replacing a high energy system in which the breakdown of biomass is routinely accelerated to prepare for new crops.

Three production inputs, fuel, farm machinery and agrochemicals (fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides) are considered. The study extends beyond the farm gate to include packing and transportation and the time period is 30 years. The results suggest that replacing the crops with plantations would indeed reduce emissions but that a pasture system would have even lower net emissions.

30|$|The {{interaction}} {{of human beings}} with wild reindeer and the animals’ grazing and trampling behaviour has shaped the northern ecosystems since {{the last ice age}} (Suominen and Olofsson 2000 : 235). Nomadic Sámi herding emerged in the 17 th century (Näkkäläjärvi 2007 : 40), and was based on <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation</b> from the coastal summer lands of Norway to inland areas of Finland-Sweden or, after Finland was ceded to Russia by Sweden in 1809, Finnish Russia (the Grand Duchy of Finland under the Russian Empire). In difficult winters, marked by hard snow, thick snow or icy ground, reindeer exhibited an emerging characteristic of seeking forage outside of the normal <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation.</b> People used to say: “After a good lemming year there will be a bad year for reindeer ”(M 1 -M 13, F 1 - 2). The reindeer “broke loose” and went into forests with a rich availability of arboreal lichens or onto fell slopes with “wind-whipped snow” (Gibson 1979; Vuojala-Magga et al. 2011; Turunen and Vuojala-Magga 2014). Animal behaviour like this {{can be seen as a}} temporal act of habitat selection resulting in an enlargement of the animals’ niche. However, harsh conditions increased winter mortality and/or reduced the reproductive rate of the weakest reindeer; in early winter these were the young rutted bulls, thereafter the one-year-old calves and, in late winter, the pregnant females.|$|R

Sir Albert Howard travelled to India to teach western agricultural techniques, but became more interested in traditional Indian agricultural practices. Between 1924 and 1931 he refined an Indian composting system, calling it Indore method (Howard, 1943). The second method was published by Rudolf Steiner (1924) as a course given to farmers in Poland, and was named biodynamic agriculture. This method differs from properly called organic agriculture in the use of special preparations —in addition to compost or manure—, consisting in mixed animal, plant and mineral products, that stimulate soil organisms.

In Section 5 (Further Reading) information on more general sheep industry software as well as references to parasite population models can be found...|$|R
2500|$|The World Bank {{has contributed}} with Uruguay {{government}} in several projects related to water resources management. In {{the context of}} the [...] a soil and water management strategy was formulated and implemented to increase, diversify and maintain agricultural production and exports of individual farmers. As a result of the project, over 2,400 farmers made investments to increase by almost 20% the irrigated areas in the country (from 35,000 hectares to a total of 190,000 hectares), where land devoted to irrigated rice crops accounted for almost 77% of the total. Despite the fact that irrigated rice fields still maintain a relatively high importance, the Project decisively supported diversification. The expansion of irrigated rice fields (19,000 hectares) financed by the project was almost fully related to the expansion of cattle breeding systems, a process by which the irrigated rice and forage crops were integrated {{to the use of the}} soil in <b>rotation</b> with <b>pastures.</b> In addition, the expansion of irrigated areas for the production of fruits and vegetables supported by the project (16,000 hectares) represented an increase of over 100% regarding the initial area where these products were grown which contributed to a considerable growth in the production of high-value crops and non-traditional exports.|$|R

40|$|Different {{plants are}} known to have {{different}} soil microbial communities associated with them. Agricultural management practices such as fertiliser and pesticide addition, crop rotation, and grazing animals can lead to different microbial communities in the associated agricultural soils. Soil dilution plates, most-probable-number (MPN), community level physiological profiling (CLPP), and buried slide technique as well as some measured soil physicochemical parameters were used to determine changes during the growing season in the ecosystem profile in wheat fields subjected to wheat monoculture or wheat in annual <b>rotation</b> with medic/clover <b>pasture.</b> Statistical analyses showed that soil moisture had an over-riding effect on seasonal fluctuations in soil physicochemical and microbial populations. While within season soil microbial activity could be differentiated between wheat fields under rotational and monoculture management, these differences were not significant...|$|R
5000|$|In April 2017, the Australian Government {{finalised}} the law {{and decided}} to mandate a maximum of 10,000 hens per hectare in outdoor grazing areas, to which the hens must have [...] "regular and meaningful" [...] access. Currently, the most popular free range accreditation schemes mandating roaming space at or below the standard set by the EU for its members, are the Free Range Farmers Association (750 hens per hectare), Humane Choice (1,500 hens per hectare) and Australian Certifed Organic (2,500 hens per hectare under <b>pasture</b> <b>rotation).</b> In July 2017, Snowdale was fined a record amount of $1.05m (including legal costs) for falsely advertising that its eggs were 'free range'. This was substantially larger than the fines imposed upon Derodi, Holland Farms, Pirovic or Darling Downs Fresh Eggs; set at either $300,000 or $250,000.|$|R
40|$|In Humboldt and Del Norte {{counties}} of California and Curry County, Oregon, Easter lilies (Lilium longiflotum) are grown commercially in a 3 - to 6 -year <b>rotation</b> with <b>pasture</b> for cattle and sheep. Bulbs are sold to greenhouse operations to produce flowering plants. The lesion nematode, Pratylenchus penetrans, {{is a serious}} detriment to Easter lily production. Both soil and planting stock are often infested; typically, a dual nematicide application is used consisting of a preplant soil fumigation followed by an at-planting application of an organophosphate or carbamate. Nematicide usage has resulted in ground-water contamination. Several factors {{that could lead to}} an improved crop rotation program were examined in five field trials in Oregon. Examining the relative nematode host status of crops for feeding cattle and sheep indicated differences in host suitability among clovers and fescues that could prove useful in development of pasture mixes. Populations of P. penetrans under continuous fallow and pasture were monitored for 4 years following harvest of Easter lilies. Populations fluctuated in both situations but generally increased on pasture plants and decreased under fallow. Nematodes were still detectable at the end of 4 years of weed-free fallow. Populations of P. penetrans on Easter lilies were followed over two successive crops. Numbers in soil peaked in July and then decreased while numbers within roots continued to increase until harvest in October...|$|R
