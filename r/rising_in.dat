5|$|Anne {{was buried}} beside {{her husband and}} {{children}} in the Henry VII Chapel on the South Aisle of Westminster Abbey on 24 August. The Electress Sophia had died on 28 May, two months before Anne, so the Electress's son, George, Elector of Hanover, inherited the British Crown pursuant to the Act of Settlement 1701. The possible Catholic claimants, including Anne's half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, were ignored. The Elector's accession was relatively stable: a Jacobite <b>rising</b> <b>in</b> 1715 failed. Marlborough was re-instated, and the Tory ministers were replaced by Whigs.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Hollander's insulin {{test was}} {{evaluated}} by performing successively partial denervation of the parietal cell area, highly selective, selective, and truncal vagotomy operations on three dogs. The <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> acidity, {{the timing of}} the highest <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> acidity, and the <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> acid output were examined. The mean <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> acidity (m-equiv/l) before vagotomy (106 ± SEl 1, 120 i 23, 60 ± 16) did not differ significantly from those obtained after partial denervation (67 ± SE 14, 125 ± 12, 45 ± 12). After selective vagotomy, a presumed complete denervation, the <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> acidity were significantly lower (0 + 0 1, 2. 5 ± 4, 0 ± 9). The Hollander test, however, was occasionally negative before any nerves had been divided, and was positive in 200 % of tests after presumed complete parietal cell denervation. The highest <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> acidity before vagotomy most commonly occurred 30 minutes after insulin, and following partial denervation this rise occurred significantly later, most commonly at 60 minutes. After the other operations there was no consistent timing. The <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> insulin-stimulated acid output after presumed complete denervation provided near complete discrimination between innervated and denervated stomachs, and its repeatability as assessed by the coefficient of variation was significantly better than the repeatability of <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> acidity...|$|R

In the center of the community, NY225 intersects CR32 (Caton–Seeley Creek Road) and CR120 (Tannery Creek Road). NY225 turns northwest at this intersection, becoming Caton Road as it follows Caton Creek out of the hamlet.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October of each year, Pleione {{along with}} the rest of the cluster can be seen <b>rising</b> <b>in</b> the east in the early morning before dawn.

Even in cities like Cape Town, South Africa, at the tip of the African continent, the star rises almost 32° above the horizon. Due to its declination of roughly +24°, Pleione is circumpolar in the northern hemisphere at latitudes greater than 66° North. Once late April arrives, the cluster can be spotted briefly in the deepening twilight of the western horizon, soon to disappear with the other setting stars.|$|E
5|$|Brendan Finucane {{was born}} on 16 October 1920, the first child of Thomas and Florence Finucane of 13 Rathmines Road, Rathmines, Dublin, Ireland. His mother was English, {{originally}} from Leicester. Her mother had travelled across Canada {{at a young age}} and Florence moved to Dublin to seek her own adventure. She accepted the risks associated with living in the city. In 1919, she met Thomas Andrew Finucane, who had been involved in the Irish Rebellion. Thomas Finucane had been taught mathematics at college by Éamon de Valera, leader of the Irish opposition. As a member of the Irish Volunteers, he served under de Valera's command in the 1916 Easter <b>Rising</b> <b>in</b> Dublin. Thomas' father—Brendan Finucane's grandfather— was an Englishman who had served in the King's Own Scottish Borderers on the North-West Frontier Province. Thomas Finucane had ceased his political activism shortly before the couple married in October 1919, and after Florence had converted to Catholicism.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{contrary}} models assert that, for example, a <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> expected inflation {{would increase}} current real spending contingent on any nominal rate and hence increase income, limiting the <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> the {{nominal interest rate}} that {{would be necessary to}} re-equilibrate money demand with money supply at any time.
