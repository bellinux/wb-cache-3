In particular, the difference between them is given by (i) application on both faces of a mortar <b>coating</b> <b>reinforced</b> with a GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers) mesh; (ii) application of the GFRP jacketing on one side only and (iii) application of a hybrid technique, obtained by {{the combination of a}} GFRP jacketing, on one side, and a reinforced repointing with steel-strands, on the other. Shear-compression (SC) and diagonal compression (DC) experiments were carried out on full-scale masonry walls both reinforced (RM) and unreinforced (URM), as reference. The structural effectiveness of the various reinforcing techniques is highlighted. Further assessment of test predictions was then performed by means of well-calibrated finite-element (FE) numerical models able to properly take into account the effective contribution of each specimen component. Interesting correlations were generally found between test predictions and corresponding numerical models. The experiments, as shown, generally evidenced a good effectiveness of the strengthening techniques proposed, with particular concern to that with the <b>reinforced</b> <b>coating</b> on both sides, and highlighted also the importance of the transversal connectors to prevent in plane cracks in the masonry and the detachment of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>coating...</b>|$|R

40|$|This work {{reports on}} the erosion {{performance}} of three particle reinforced metal matrix composite coatings, co-deposited with an aluminium binder via cold-gas dynamic spraying. The deposition of ceramic particles is difficult to achieve with typical cold spray techniques due {{to the absence of}} particle deformation. This issue has been overcome in the present study by simultaneously spraying the reinforcing particles with a ductile metallic binder which has led to an increased level of ceramic/cermet particles deposited on the substrate with thick (> 400 µm) coatings produced. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the erosion performance of the co-deposited coatings within a slurry environment. The study also incorporated standard metallographic characterisation techniques to evaluate the distribution of reinforcing particles within the aluminium matrix. All coatings exhibited poorer erosion performance than the uncoated material, both in terms of volume loss and mass loss. The Al 2 O 3 <b>reinforced</b> <b>coating</b> sustained the greatest amount of damage following exposure to the slurry and recorded the greatest volume loss (approx. 2. 8 mm 3) out of all of the examined coatings. Despite the poor erosion performance, the WC-CoCr <b>reinforced</b> <b>coating</b> demonstrated a considerable hardness increase over the as-received AA 5083 (approx. 400 %) and also exhibited the smallest free space length between adjacent particles. The findings of this study reveal that the removal of the AA 5083 matrix by the impinging silicon carbide particles acts as the primary wear mechanism leading to the degradation of the coating. Analysis of the wear scar has demonstrated that the damage to the soft matrix alloy takes the form of ploughing and scoring which subsequently exposes carbide/oxide particles to the impinging slurry...|$|R

In order to improve the hardness and wear resistance properties of stainless steel surface, TiC <b>reinforced</b> <b>coating</b> has been produced on AISI 304 stainless steel using pulsed Nd:YAG laser and Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) cladding process. Further, to enhance the efficiency of TIG cladding process {{as well as to}} amend the tribological properties of TiC based coating, Ni (for better bonding) and CaF 2 (as a solid lubricant) have been incorporated in various phases of experiments.

A recent experimental campaign evidenced the effectiveness of this technique both in terms of resistance and deformation capacity of masonry walls. The paper focuses on the in-plane behavior of reinforced masonry, collecting the results of diagonal compression tests performed on solid brick masonry specimens enhanced by considering 17 different types of mortar for the coating (tensile resistances ranging from 0. 7 to 3 MPa, Young modulus from 6000 to 23000 MPa). These experimental results are useful to extend the validity of an analytical formulation proposed by the authors and to investigate on the behavior of the reinforced masonry when the coating mechanical characteristics vary considerably.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this article}} we utilize a {{concentric}} cylinder model to analyze the stress state in a continuously <b>reinforced</b> <b>coated</b> fiber composite subjected to transverse loading. We incorporate this analysis into a methodical approach to determine an optimal inter-phase coating for the fibers to maximize the composite’s transverse strain to failure. The present study focuses {{on the effect of}} interphase Young’s modulus on the stress state in the matrix material of a composite subjected to constant strain (displacement) boundary con-ditions. We demonstrate, by analytically varying the coating modulus, that an optimum in-terphase property exists which minimizes the maximum principal stress and the strain en-ergy density in the composite material. The minimization of these quantities clearly indicates that failure initiation in a composite with an optimal fiber coating will occur at a significantly larger strain level. Therefore, we postulate (based on the current analysis) that the transverse strain to failure of a composite system can be increased with appropriate fiber coatings. Results and design curves are presented for an AS- 4 /Epon 828 composite system which suggest that for large fiber volume fractions (i. e., 60 %) the optimum coating is an elastomeric material. The data presented on this composite suggest that the strain to failure can be increased as much as 6 times by coating the structural fibers with an optimal coating. A comparison between constant stress boundary conditions (i. e., optimizing strength) and constant strain boundary conditions (i. e., optimizing strain to failure) are also presented...|$|R
