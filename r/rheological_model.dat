40|$|Abstract: Blood {{rheology}} {{is complex}} and nonlinear. The effective viscosity variations are important due to red blood cells packing inside capillaries, the socalled FåhræusLindquist effect, whilst concomitantly phase segregation appears in bifurcations. We have performed direct numerical simulations of different nonlinear <b>rheological</b> <b>models</b> of the blood on realistic threedimensional microvascular networks. These simulations point out two significant results. First, various <b>rheological</b> <b>models</b> lead to very similar pressure distributions over {{the whole range of}} physiologically relevant hematocrits. Secondly, different models for phase segregation lead to very distinct hematocrit distributions in the microvascular network. Moreover, for all the investigated <b>rheological</b> <b>models,</b> the hematocrit distribution very weakly affects the pressure distribution, when prescribing uniform pressure boundary conditions...|$|R
50|$|The {{relationships}} between shear stress and shear rate for blood must be determined experimentally and expressed by constitutive equations. Given the complex macro-rheological behavior of blood, {{it is not}} surprising that a single equation fails to completely describe the effects of various rheological variables (e.g., hematocrit, shear rate). Thus, several approaches to defining these equations exist, with some the result of curve-fitting experimental data and others based on a particular <b>rheological</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{workability}} and flowability {{of concrete}} are straightforwardly {{influenced by the}} rheological properties of cement paste. <b>Rheological</b> <b>models</b> {{are based on the}} factors, which influence the cement paste rheology. Parameters like shear rate, chemical admixtures, water-cement ratio and supplementary cementitious materials greatly influence the rheology of cement paste (Papo 1988). Therefore, a single model cannot be used to predict the flow behaviour of cement paste (Yahia and Khayat 2001). The accuracy of available models can be checked by comparing the predicted data with the experimental data. Hence, in this study, the accuracy of four available <b>rheological</b> <b>models</b> have been assessed.|$|R

40|$|Summary. The {{irregular}} {{behavior of}} {{some kinds of}} suspensions {{on the basis of}} polymeric compositions and fine-dispersed fractions is characterized. As a simple, one-dimensional, shearing, viscometric flow such materials demonstrate the following mechanical behavior. There is no deformation if the shear stress does not exceed a certain critical value. If this critical value is exceeded, the flow is begins. This behavior is well-known and corresponds to the rheological models of viscoplastic fluid. However, further increase in the shear rate results in “solidification”. The <b>rheological</b> <b>model</b> of such viscoplastic fluids, mechanical behavior demonstrating the “solidification” effect is offered. This model contains four empirical parameters. The impact of the exponent on the dependence of the shearing stress and effective viscosity on the shear rate in the <b>rheological</b> <b>model</b> is graphically presented.

40|$|The {{objective}} is to estimate the vastus medialis (VM) muscle force from multifrequency magnetic resonance elastography MMRE tests and two different <b>rheological</b> <b>models</b> (Voigt and springpot). Healthy participants (N 13) underwent multifrequency (70, 90 and 110 Hz) magnetic resonance elastography MMRE tests. Thus, in vivo experimental elastic () properties of the VM in passive and active (20 % MVC) conditions were characterized. Moreover, the muscle viscosity () was determined with Voigt and springpot <b>rheological</b> <b>models,</b> in both muscle states. Subsequently, the VM muscle forces were calculated with a generic musculoskeletal model (OpenSIM) where the active and passive shear moduli () were implemented. The viscosity measured with the two <b>rheological</b> <b>models</b> in-creased when the muscle is contracted. During the stance and the swing phases, the VM tensile forces decrease and the VM force was lower with the springpot model. It can be noted that during the swing phase, the muscle forces estimated from springpot model showed a higher standard deviation com-pared to the Voigt model. This last result may indicate a strong sensitivity of the muscle force to the change of active and passive contractile components in the swing phase of gait.

40|$|International audienceIn {{numerical}} {{approaches for}} high speed machining, the rheological behavior of machined materials is usually {{described by a}} Johnson Cook law. However, {{studies have shown that}} dynamic recrystallization phenomena appear during machining in the tool/chip interface. The Johnson Cook constitutive law does not include such phenomena. Thus, specific <b>rheological</b> <b>models</b> based on metallurgy are introduced to consider these dynamic recrystallization phenomena. Two empirical models proposed by Kim et al. (2003) and Lurdos (2008) are investigated in machining modeling. A two-dimensional finite element model of orthogonal cutting, using an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation, is developed with the Abaqus/explicit software. Specific <b>rheological</b> <b>models</b> are implemented in the calculation code thanks to a subroutine. This finite element model can then predict chip formation, interfacial temperatures, chip-tool contact length, cutting forces and chip thickness with also and especially the recrystallized area. New specific experiments on an orthogonal cutting test bench are conducted on AISI 1045 steel specimens with an uncoated carbide tool. Many tests are performed and results are focused on total chip thicknesses and recrystallized chip thicknesses. Finally, compared to numerical results got with a Johnson Cook law, numerical results obtained using specific <b>rheological</b> <b>models</b> to take into account dynamic recrystallization phenomena are very close to experimental results. This work shows also the influence of rheological behavior laws on predicted results in the modeling of high speed modeling...|$|R
