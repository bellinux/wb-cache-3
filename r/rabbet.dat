25|$|Rebated doors, a term chiefly used in Britain, are {{double doors}} having a lip or overlap (i.e. a <b>Rabbet)</b> on the {{vertical}} edge(s) where they meet.

25|$|A {{radial arm}} saw has a {{circular}} saw mounted on a sliding horizontal arm. In addition to making length cuts a {{radial arm saw}} may be configured with a dado blade to create cuts for dado, <b>rabbet</b> or half lap joints. Some radial arm saws allow the blade to be turned parallel to the back fence allowing a rip cut to be performed. In 1922, Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey invented the radial arm saw. A patent was applied for in 1923 and awarded to De Walt in 1925.|$|E

50|$|Jointers {{are also}} used for making rebates (also known as <b>rabbets</b> in North America) in {{finished}} timber.

50|$|A <b>rabbet</b> (also {{known as}} a rebate in Britain) is a recess or groove cut into {{the edge of a}} piece of {{machinable}} material, usually wood. When viewed in cross-section, a <b>rabbet</b> is two-sided and open to the edge or end of the surface into which it is cut.|$|E
50|$|The rebate plane {{commonly}} has a {{depth stop}} and a fence {{which allows the}} width and depth of the <b>rabbet</b> to be gauged.

50|$|Small {{doors and}} {{shutters}} {{such as those}} found in barns and sheds are often constructed of shiplap cut directly from the walls, with only thin members framing or crossing the back for support.

50|$|Hive {{bodies and}} hive supers are four-sided boxes with {{standardized}} inside dimensions. There are generally four different sizes. Outside box dimensions {{vary depending on}} the type of material used. Polystyrene boxes have much larger outside dimensions than boxes made out of wood. Deep and medium hive bodies are provided to serve as the brood chamber, the part of the hive where the queen lays eggs and the bees care for the larvae. Medium, shallow and comb honey supers are used for honey stores and to harvest the honey. The inside width is 14-11/16 inches (373 mm) and the inside length is 18-5/16 inches (465 mm). The frames rest on a <b>rabbeted</b> side along both ends of each box.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} the use of a <b>rabbet</b> is in a glazing bar where it makes {{provision}} for the insertion of the pane of glass and putty. It may also accommodate the edge of the back panel of a cabinet. It is also used in door and casement window jambs, and for shiplap planking. A <b>rabbet</b> can be used to form a joint with another piece of wood (often containing a dado).|$|E
