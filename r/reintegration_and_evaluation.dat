Participants were 51 people, with an initial stroke, admitted to an acute hospital and discharged to the community. Admission and discharge data were obtained by chart review. Follow-up status was determined by telephone interview using the Modified Barthel Index, the Assessment of Living Skills <b>and</b> Resources, the <b>Reintegration</b> to Normal Living Index, and the Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 36). At follow up, 57 % of participants were independent in basic ADL, 84 % had a low risk of experiencing instrumental ADL difficulties, most had few concerns with community <b>reintegration,</b> <b>and</b> SF- 36 physical functioning and vitality scores were lower than normative values. At follow up, poorer discharge basic ADL status was associated with poorer instrumental ADL <b>and</b> community <b>reintegration</b> status, <b>and</b> older participants had poorer instrumental ADL, community <b>reintegration</b> <b>and</b> physical functioning. Occupational therapists need to consider these outcomes when planning inpatient and post-discharge intervention for people after stroke...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a holistic, contextualised {{case study of}} <b>reintegration</b> <b>and</b> trust repair at a UK utilities firm {{in the wake of}} its fraud and data manipulation scandal. Drawing upon conceptual frameworks of <b>reintegration</b> <b>and</b> organizational trust repair, we analyze the decisions and actions taken by the company in its efforts to restore trust with its stakeholders. The analysis reveals seven themes on the merits of proposed approaches for reintegration after an integrity violation (including open investigations, accurate explanations, apologies, penance, and systemic reforms), and novel insights on the role of organizational identity, “changing of the guard” and cultural reforms alongside procedural modifications. The case further supports the dynamic nature of stakeholder salience across the reintegration process. The study both supports propositions from existing frameworks and suggests novel theoretical extensions for future research...|$|R
