5|$|Martin Graetz, Stephen Russell and Wayne Wiitanen {{conceived}} the computer game Spacewar! {{while working at}} Harvard University in 1961. Inspired by Marvin Minsky's Three Position Display (which they dubbed the Minskytron), they had the first version <b>running,</b> <b>with</b> help from their MIT classmates Dan Edwards, Kotok, Stephen D.

5|$|Bomar, of Vanderbilt, is only shaded {{a little}} by two other ends, largely through the {{experienced}} gained by his rivals against stronger opposition.

A dream sequence of the opening scene of the film Chariots of Fire shows the characters running across a beach, though Mr. Bean dreams he is <b>running</b> <b>with</b> them. He begins to fall behind, until he hails a car to overtake all the others. Now running in front, Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of the runners trying to overtake him, whereupon he crosses the line with elation, and then wakes up. Finding {{that the rest of}} the orchestra have stopped playing while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from Rattle, plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound, then stops.|$|E
5|$|In November 2015, Varian {{announced}} {{that she would be}} working with the California Rangeland Trust to place her ranch into a conservation easement to protect it from development. She had begun the project with the intent that her longtime ranch manager, Angela Alvarez, would operate the horse breeding program after Varian was no longer able to do so, and then once Alvarez was no longer able to run the ranch, the property would be gifted to the Trust to be sold, the conservation easement <b>running</b> <b>with</b> the land, and attempts made to find a buyer that would also be interested in maintaining the Arabian horse breeding program.|$|E

The 2012 ceremony had bicyclists with dove-wings, lit by LEDs. In the 2014 ceremony several dancers, holding strands of blue LED lights, danced on the shape of a dove projected on the stadium floor.

5|$|In {{the mating}} season, rutting males move about {{in search of}} females in oestrus. Males become {{aggressive}} and fight among themselves for dominance. These fights are characterised by displays of the enlarged chest, the throat patch and the beard while holding the head upright; and threatening the opponent by <b>running</b> <b>with</b> the horns pointed toward him and circling him. The victorious bull would protect {{the vicinity of the}} targeted female from other males. The courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes. The male, stiff and composed, approaches the receptive female, who keeps her head low to the ground and may slowly walk forward. The male licks her genitalia, upon which the female holds her tail to a side and the male gives out a flehmen response. Finally, the male pushes his chest against her rump, and mounts her.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{refused to}} turn professional, and {{continued}} running as amateur in Finland. In 1933, {{he ran his}} first 1500 m in three years and won the national title with his best time since 1926. At the IAAF meet in August 1934, Finland launched two proposals that lost. The council then brought forward its resolution empowering it to suspend athletes that it finds {{in violation of the}} IAAF amateur code. With a 12–5 vote, with many not voting, Nurmi's suspension from international amateur athletics became definite. Less than three weeks later, Nurmi retired from <b>running</b> <b>with</b> a 10,000 m victory in Viipuri on 16 September 1934. Nurmi remained undefeated in the distance throughout his 14-year top-level career. In cross country running, his win streak lasted 19 years.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{considered}} arboreal quadrupeds, {{with the most}} common type of movement being above-branch quadrupedalism. While in the canopy leaping, vertical clinging, and suspensory behavior, are also common, while bridging, bimanual movement, and bipedalism are infrequently seen. When moving from tree to tree, ruffed lemurs will look over the shoulder while clinging, launch themselves into the air, and twist mid-air so that their ventral surface lands on the new tree or limb. Suspensory behavior is more common in ruffed lemurs than in other lemur species. When ruffed lemurs come down to the ground, they continue to move quadrupedally, <b>running</b> <b>with</b> bounding hops and the tail held high.|$|E

5|$|The first {{train to}} use the new line was pulled by the Victoria. It left Manchester at 8:00am, and arrived in Bolton 26minutes 30seconds later. The second train was pulled by the Fairfield. The trains {{originally}} ran on the right hand set of rails, an unusual practice in England, however the railway later changed to left-hand <b>running</b> <b>with</b> the connection of the MB at Clifton. Ten trains ran in each direction per weekday, and two on Sundays. The journey from Salford to Bolton took about 35minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} and series trains have various differences. The {{number of}} seats was increased from 264 to 309 by changing the seat configuration in second class from 2+1 to 2+2. The information screens {{on the outside of}} the carriages were moved from the center of the carriages to next to the doors. There are also differences with the light switch logic, which often leads to the trains <b>running</b> <b>with</b> both front and tail lights on at the same end. The prototypes differed also originally by their restaurant car and Extra class features. They were modified in the mid-2000s to be similar to the series trains.|$|E

After he clocked in behind both Ferrari drivers in his first run, Rosberg improved to second place on his second time out, {{but was unable to}} challenge teammate Hamilton, who took the fiftieth pole position of his career. Every other driver was limited to only one timed lap and in the end, the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen locked out the second row on the grid ahead of Max Verstappen and Felipe Massa. Sainz and Ricciardo rounded up the top eight on the grid. Therefore, Q3 saw little <b>running</b> <b>with</b> the final positions determined very early on and drivers exiting their cars five minutes before the end of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{continued}} acting {{mostly in}} independent films, including Pretty Persuasion (2005), Down in the Valley (2005), <b>Running</b> <b>with</b> Scissors (2006), {{and in the}} big studio production Across the Universe (2007). Since 2008, Wood has appeared in more mainstream films, including The Wrestler (2008), Whatever Works (2009) and The Ides of March (2011). She also returned to television, playing the supporting role of Queen Sophie-Anne on True Blood from 2009 to 2011 and playing Kate Winslet's character's daughter in the HBO miniseries Mildred Pierce (2011), for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe and Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress. As of 2016, she plays the sapient android Dolores Abernathy in the HBO series Westworld, for which she won a Critics' Choice Award and earned a Golden Globe and Emmy Award nomination.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass {{with the body}} held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then go into a crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using their speed and maneuverability, <b>running</b> <b>with</b> the body held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and fluttering, especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with its legs drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, not learned from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E
