5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with <b>refocusing</b> the Klan on political activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused on money and power than any particular ideology.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, as {{with most}} other aspects of A/S, no clear plan existed for the {{armament}} of Coastal Command's aircraft. While operational control {{was given to the}} Admiralty, the faith of both services in ASDIC proved ill-founded. It ruled out the submarine threat, and caused a <b>refocusing</b> on surface attacks. In addition, no A/S weapons had been developed properly in the inter-war period. Most of the munitions were left over from the First World War, due in part to a wish to economise and the fact no order had been given to dispose of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{periscopes}} {{also had}} problems with their optics: periscope users reported difficulty in <b>refocusing</b> after changing magnification, duplication of images, and bands across the field of vision. These problems were attributed to RAN demands that the optical view be the first exposed when a periscope was raised above the water, instead of placing the infrared sensor and single-pulse radar at the head as on other submarines, requiring the optical path to be routed around these components. The periscopes were gradually improved, and were no longer a problem {{by the time the}} fast track submarines entered service.|$|E
40|$|Background: There is an {{emerging}} evidence base about best practice in supporting recovery. This is usually framed {{in relation to}} general principles, and specific pro-recovery interventions are lacking. Aims: To develop a theoretically-based and empirically-defensible new pro-recovery manualised intervention – called the <b>REFOCUS</b> intervention. Method: Seven systematic and two narrative reviews were undertaken. Identified evidence gaps were addressed in three qualitative studies. The findings were synthesised to produce the <b>REFOCUS</b> intervention, manual and model. Results: The <b>REFOCUS</b> intervention comprises two components: recovery-promoting relationships and working practices. Approaches to supporting relationships comprise coaching skills training for staff, developing a shared team understanding of recovery, exploring staff values, a Partnership Project with people who use the service, and raising service user expectations. Working practices comprise: Understanding values and treatment preferences; Assessing strengths; and Supporting goal-striving. The <b>REFOCUS</b> model describes the causal pathway from the <b>REFOCUS</b> intervention to improved recovery. Conclusion: The <b>REFOCUS</b> intervention is an empirically-supported pro-recovery intervention for use in mental health services. It will be evaluated in a multisite cluster randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN 02507940) ...|$|R

5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested {{that he would have}} liked to have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with <b>refocusing</b> and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings and the fact that the deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still trying to get their act together. If you look at what we paid it will go down in history as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E

25|$|The Ursulines {{took over}} the boys' {{educational}} program from the Jesuits. The <b>refocusing</b> of Jesuit energy on Holy Family Mission {{did not mean that}} the Jesuits abandoned St. Peter's Mission. It still acted as a base of operations and a residence until May 1898, when Father Damiani (Superior of St. Peter's since 1892) and the remaining three Jesuit priests announced they would abandon the mission. The diocesan clergy remained to care for the church and conduct Mass, while the Ursulines remained to oversee the educational function.|$|E

The most shocking change to Honda came when Kawamoto ended Honda's successful participation in Formula One after the 1992 season, citing costs in light of the takeover threat from Mitsubishi as well as the desire to create a more environmentally-friendly company image.|$|E
25|$|The Chelsea {{version was}} marked by a unique {{production}} style. Eugene Lee helped Prince {{make sure that the}} multi-scene show would not get bogged down in set changes - he created platforms for the action that allowed scenes to change by <b>refocusing</b> attention instead of changing scenery. Actors performed on platforms in front, behind, and sometimes between audience members. Some sat on bleachers, others on stools on the stage floor. As the story unfolded, so did the stage, with sections falling from above, opening, closing, flying apart or coming together. A 13-member orchestra played from four areas. The conductor, who wore period costume and gold braid, could be seen by audience and musicians alike on television monitors.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{became the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 12 September 1997, resigning the {{presidency}} {{a few weeks}} early {{in order to take}} up the post. Media reports suggested that she had been head-hunted for the post by Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan to assume an advocacy as opposed to administrative role, in other words to become a public campaigner outlining principles rather than the previous implementational and consensus-building model. The belief was that the post had ceased to be seen as the voice of general principles and had become largely bureaucratic. Robinson's role was to set the human rights agenda within the organisation and internationally, <b>refocusing</b> its appeal.|$|E

25|$|Maurice's Balkan campaigns were {{a series}} of {{military}} expeditions conducted by the East Roman (Byzantine) emperor Maurice (reigned 582–602) {{in an attempt to}} defend the Balkan provinces of the Eastern Roman Empire from the Avars and Slavs. Maurice was the only East Roman emperor, except for Anastasius I, who did his best to implement determined Balkan policies during Late Antiquity, paying adequate attention to the safety of the northern frontier against barbarian incursions. During the second half of his reign, the Balkan campaigns were the main focus of Maurice's foreign policies, as a favourable peace treaty with Persia in 591 enabled him to shift his experienced troops from the Persian front to the region. The <b>refocusing</b> of Roman efforts soon paid off: the frequent Roman failures before 591 were succeeded by a string of successes afterwards.|$|E
500|$|During both World Wars the Languedoc was {{responsible}} for providing the daily wine rations given to French soldiers. In 1962, Algeria gained its independence from France, bringing about {{an end to the}} blending of the stronger Algerian red wine to mask the thin le gros rouge. This event, coupled with French consumers moving away from cheap red wines in the 1970s, has contributed to several decades of surplus wine production in France, with Languedoc as the largest contributor to the European [...] "wine lake" [...] and recurring European Union subsidies aimed at reducing production. These developments prompted many Languedoc producers to start <b>refocusing</b> on higher quality, but has also led to many local and regional protests, including violent ones from the infamous Comité Régional d'Action Viticole (CRAV).|$|E

40|$|Echo-planar diffusion-weighted {{images can}} display {{significant}} geometric distortions due to eddy current fields. Several preparation schemes have been proposed, which can null eddy currents {{with a single}} time constant. The aim of this work was to compare the performance of three such pulse sequences {{in the presence of}} multiple components and investigate whether affine registration is capable of correcting for the resulting distortions. A magnetic resonance imaging simulator was used to eliminate potential confounding factors. The doubly <b>refocused</b> sequences showed substantially reduced effects. Applying affine registration to the single spin-echo images leads to reduced residuals, but not to the level observed for the doubly <b>refocused</b> sequences. Modified versions of the standard single spin-echo and doubly <b>refocused</b> sequences performed better than their original counterparts. Affine registration is not sufficient to correct for strong eddy current effects, which should therefore be minimized at source. When the use of a doubly <b>refocused</b> sequence is not possible, a modified single spin-echo sequence should be considered...|$|R
