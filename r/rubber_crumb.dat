40|$|ABSTRACT: Studies of binders {{containing}} <b>crumb</b> <b>rubber</b> {{have shown}} improvements in durability, crack reflection, fatigue resistance, skid resistance, and mechanical characteristics over typical {{hot mix asphalt}} (HMA) mixtures. However, an improved understanding of the physical changes to <b>crumb</b> <b>rubber</b> particles {{as a result of}} production of asphalt rubber binders is important to stimulate the use of rubberized asphalt mixtures. Although past research has found that the size of <b>crumb</b> <b>rubber</b> will change when it mixes with hot asphalt binder, the result has not yet been identified clearly. The objective of this research was to investigate the permanent dimensional changes of <b>crumb</b> <b>rubber</b> (e. g., size and morphology) after mixing with asphalt binder using the “wet” method. This investigation evaluated the effects of <b>crumb</b> <b>rubber</b> size, binder source, and reaction duration on the dimensional changes of <b>crumb</b> <b>rubber.</b> Binders containing <b>crumb</b> <b>rubber</b> were produced in the laboratory, then the <b>crumb</b> <b>rubber</b> was extracted from the binder and permanent changes to the rubber particles were measured...|$|R

This paper looks {{at some of the}} international standards for producing <b>crumb</b> <b>rubber</b> modified bitumen (CRMB) and reviews the effect of <b>crumb</b> <b>rubber</b> to the rheology of <b>crumb</b> <b>rubber</b> modified bitumen. The review shows that the rheology of CRMB depends on internal factors such as <b>crumb</b> <b>rubber</b> quantity, particle size, and pure bitumen composition, and external factors such as the mixing time, temperature, and also the modification technique.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} techniques for increasing the performance of pavement rehabilitation is the use of asphalt rubber mixtures, which utilize <b>crumb</b> <b>rubber</b> from used tires for modifying the asphalt to produce asphalt <b>rubber</b> binder. <b>Crumb</b> <b>rubber</b> can be produced by two different types of grinding, ambient and cryogenic. The asphalt rubber binder used in asphalt rubber mixtures can be obtained through two different processes, terminal blending (produced at a refinery) and continuous blending (produced in a plant). Because the performance of the asphalt rubber binder depends on the elastomeric properties of the <b>crumb</b> <b>rubber,</b> the manufacturing process, especially the digestion time, influences these properties.
