50|$|The more traditional, fixed bomb rack, a {{conventional}} bomb rack {{like that of}} the B-52 would have mounted stores in vertical columns making individual store selection and release impossible without releasing all stores ahead in the column line. The advantage of {{a conventional}} bomb rack is a prompt release of all stores in short order.Bombers like the B-52, the B-1 or the B-2 use custom designed bomb <b>rack</b> <b>support</b> structures with their own designation e.g. Common Bomb Rack (CBR), Common Bomb Module (CBM), or Smart Bomb Rack Assembly (SBRA). These bomb racks may have special store release control mechanisms. Aside from the release options of a rack a pilot can select release mode for releasing one or multiple stores. Stores can be jettisoned selectively in single mode or ripple mode or salvo mode. The term ripple applies to the single- or ripple and single- continuous release mode from one or from mirror stations. Salvo release mode applies to a combination of several stations together e.g. adjacent stations. For multiple store release an interval timer can be set to release stores in fixed time steps. For an external store emergency release there may be a panic button to release all of the weapons.|$|E
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} three dimensional (3 D) single rack {{model and}} a nonlinear 3 D whole pool multi-rack model are {{developed for the}} spent fuel storage racks of {{a nuclear power plant}} (NPP) to determine impacts and frictional motion responses when subjected to 3 D excitations from the supporting building floor. The submerged free standing rack system and surrounding water are coupled due to hydrodynamic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) using potential theory. The models developed have features that allow consideration of geometric and material nonlinearities including (1) the impacts of fuel assemblies to rack cells, a rack to adjacent racks or pool walls, and <b>rack</b> <b>support</b> legs to the pool floor; (2) the hydrodynamic coupling of fuel assemblies with their storing racks, and of a rack with adjacent racks, pool walls, and the pool floor; and (3) the dynamic motion behavior of rocking, twisting, and frictional sliding of rack modules. Using these models 3 D nonlinear time history dynamic analyses are performed per the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) criteria. Since few such modeling, analyses, and results using both the 3 D single and whole pool multiple rack models are available in the literature, this paper emphasizes description of modeling and analysis techniques using the SOLVIA general purpose nonlinear finite element code. Typical response results with different Coulomb friction coefficients are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|The Materials Science Research Rack (MSRR) is a {{research}} facility developed under a cooperative research agreement between NASA and ESA for materials science investigations on the International Space Station (ISS). MSRR was launched on STS- 128 in August 2009 and currently resides in the U. S. Destiny Laboratory Module. Since that time, MSRR has logged more than 1000 hours of operating time. The MSRR accommodates advanced investigations in the microgravity environment on the ISS for basic materials science research {{in areas such as}} solidification of metals and alloys. The purpose is to advance the scientific understanding of materials processing as affected by microgravity and to gain insight into the physical behavior of materials processing. MSRR allows for the study of a variety of materials, including metals, ceramics, semiconductor crystals, and glasses. Materials science research benefits from the microgravity environment of space, where the researcher can better isolate chemical and thermal properties of materials from the effects of gravity. With this knowledge, reliable predictions can be made about the conditions required on Earth to achieve improved materials. MSRR is a highly automated facility with a modular design capable of supporting multiple types of investigations. The NASA-provided <b>Rack</b> <b>Support</b> Subsystem provides services (power, thermal control, vacuum access, and command and data handling) to the ESA-developed Materials Science Laboratory (MSL) that accommodates interchangeable Furnace Inserts (FI). Two ESA-developed FIs are presently available on the ISS: the Low Gradient Furnace (LGF) and the Solidification and Quenching Furnace (SQF). Sample Cartridge Assemblies (SCAs), each containing one or more material samples, are installed in the FI by the crew and can be processed at temperatures up to 1400 C. ESA continues to develop samples with 14 planned for launch and processing in the near future. Additionally NASA has begun developing SCAs to support US PIs and their partners. The first of these Flight SCAs are being developed for investigations to support research in the areas of crystal growth and liquid phase sintering. Subsequent investigations are in various stages of development. US investigations will include a ground test program in order to distinguish the particular effects of the absence of gravity...|$|E

40|$|Apartment living can be crowded {{especially}} for a cyclist. Bicycles are bulky and difficult to store. A device is needed to store two road bikes weighing up to 40 pounds each while saving as much space as possible. To solve this problem many iterations of various free standing and wall-leaning bike rack designs were drawn. Evolution of the design can be traced through the drawings included in the report. The first design analyzed was a free standing rack. After calculations and adjustments this design {{was going to have}} to be very bulky in order to achieve the stability requirements. The next design that was analyzed was a wall-leaning rack. This design was very compact and satisfied the stability requirements gracefully. In winter, materials were ordered and prepared for construction. Construction included cutting ABS pipe, gluing or drilling and pinning fittings. Construction was completed without major issues. The final device is working properly despite a couple of minor clearance related oversights. The bike <b>rack</b> <b>supports</b> two bikes weighing 35 pounds each. The compactness requirement of 72 inches squared was met. This spring the deflection of the rack will be tested and compared to the predicted data.

40|$|Goods and {{products}} are often stored in framed systems, such as pallet racks, {{which are used}} for industrial and commercial activities. Recently, pallet rack provisions have been significantly improved {{but there are still}} relevant aspects that need urgent attention for guaranteeing safe structural design. Among them, the interaction between the <b>rack</b> and the <b>supporting</b> surface (i. e. concrete foundation or floor slab) plays a non-negligible influence in routine design, owing to the high degree of redundancy of the skeleton frames. In addition, rack design is usually carried out using analysis packages unable to capture the behaviour of mono-symmetric cross-section members and hence all the warping effects are generally ignored. This paper summarizes a study on the influence of floor displacements on the performance of medium-rise steel storage pallet racks. In order to obtain a reasonably wide range of data of practical interest for routine design, numerical analyses have been carried out by varying several key parameters such as the position of the rack on the floor slab, the rack geometry, the floor span length and the degree of rotational stiffness of both beam-to-column and base-plate connections. Moreover, attention has been focused on the influence of the accuracy of the structural model used in the design and two commercial analysis packages, differing for the degree of refinement of the implemented finite element beam formulation, have been considered. Finally, a suitable equation is presented to estimate the reduction of performance with respect to the ideal case of <b>racks</b> <b>supported</b> by rigid floor slab...|$|R

One of the main features of the instrument is expandability, and it includes 75 microtones in the middle octave. The justly tuned instruments of Harry Partch inspired the instrument. The Woodstock Gamelan has two types of aluminum tubes. <b>Racks</b> <b>support</b> the tubes down to Eb 4, and these have a vibraphonelike timbre. The larger hanging tubes go down to G 3, and have larger diameters than the rack tubes. The sound of the hanging tubes {{is similar to that}} of orchestral chimes. The Woodstock Gamelan has five exponentially decaying partials, and their frequency ratios are the same in the low and high registers. The frequency ratios measured were about 1, 2. 69, 5. 15, 8. 38, and 12. 08. The ratios are close to the just ratios of 1, 2. 667, 5. 333, 8. 533, and 12.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of thin-walled cold-formed elements is for the fabrication of selective steel storage pallet racks used to store goods. From the structural point of view, these systems are generally unbraced in the longitudinal direction and braced in the transversal direction. Recently, pallet rack provisions have been significantly improved, especially for what concerns design assisted by testing; however, further key aspects of relevance for structural design need urgent attention. Among them, it is worth mentioning the interaction between the <b>racks</b> and the <b>supporting</b> surfaces (i. e. foundations or floor slabs), which is expected to have a non-negligible influence in routine design, owing to the high degree of redundancy of the rack skeleton frames. This paper summarizes a study on the influence of floor displacements on the performance of medium-rise steel storage pallet racks. In order to propose a wide range of data of practical interest for routine design, the effective load-carrying capacity has been evaluated by varying the position of the rack on the floor slab, the rack geometry, the ratio between the floor span and the rack length and the degree of rotational stiffness of both beam-to-column joints and base-plate connections. Moreover, a suitable equation, which is independent of the adopted design approach, is proposed to estimate the reduction of the performance with respect to the ideal case of <b>racks</b> <b>supported</b> by a rigid floor slab. Validation of the equation is carried out using design cases that are significantly different from those used for its calibration. Finally, Appendix A proposes complete design examples detailing the main calculations necessary to predict the reduction of the load carrying capacity associated with the floor slab deflection...|$|R
