5000|$|... 1992: The Summit Wagon {{joined the}} line, {{and it was}} a {{completely}} different vehicle featuring a high roofline and sliding <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>door.</b> This [...] "crossover" [...] design was actually a rebadged Mitsubishi RVR, thus not related to the Mirage-based Summits. The Wagon was available in DL and LX trims, as well as in a four-wheel drive (AWD) version. The new Summit Wagon was marketed as blending the maneuverability of a small car with the roominess of a minivan with its interior offering high seating positions and removable rear seats. It was designed to attract young families with seating for five.|$|R
25|$|The eight {{wheels are}} located as two sets, with two pairs {{at the front}} of the hull and two pairs at the <b>rear.</b> Split <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> are located between these two sets of wheels. The two forward pairs of wheels are {{utilized}} with power steering.|$|R
50|$|The term 'omnibus' {{carried over}} to motor vehicles. The 1914 book Motor Body-building {{in all its}} Branches, by Christopher William Terry, {{described}} an omnibus as having longitudinal seats in rows with either a <b>rear</b> <b>door</b> or <b>side</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tracing {{their roots}} {{back to the}} early days of automobiles, panel vans have {{historically}} been a part of major American car manufacturer's line-ups. Known as a [...] "sedan delivery" [...] in American English, it is a basically a two-door station wagon with sheet-metal panels in place of <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> and windows. Sedan deliveries have spartan interior trim and were used by businesses much as cargo vans are used today.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> open {{outward from}} the front but are not {{referred}} to as suicide doors: they cannot be opened if the conventional front doors are not open. To accommodate elimination of the B-pillars, which provides unobstructed access for side loading through the 2006 model year, limited by the front seat design from 2007 onward, the Element features a chassis with reinforced joints, strengthened lower side sills, larger cross members, enlarged rocker panels, and five bulkheads per side.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} Eurovans {{were introduced in}} June 1994. They are smaller than American vans, like the Chrysler Voyager, which is also available in Europe. In contrast to the Toyota Previa, and like American minivans, they had sliding <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors,</b> a trait they share with their commercial siblings. In {{spite of the fact}} that the Voyager also came in the [...] "Grand" [...] versions with elongated body and wheelbase (and the Espace followed suit in 1997), the Eurovans only came in one size.|$|E
50|$|The 1906 Lambert model 8 was a side {{entrance}} touring automobile. It was a 5 passenger automobile. The wheelbase was 98 in, gauge 56 in. The wheels were 34 in by 4.5 in. It weighed 2300 {{pounds and}} cost $3000, including five oil lamps, mats, horn, generator, Jones Speedometer, and full tool equipment. The motor was four 4-cycle water-cooled vertical cylinders, tandem 4.5 X 5 {{in with a}} friction disk drive, side chains to the <b>rear</b> wheels. <b>Side</b> <b>doors</b> to tonneau and <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> to driver's seat. It was designed for extended traveling.|$|R
50|$|The M102 is {{also used}} on the United States Air Force's Lockheed AC-130 gunship. The M102 105&thinsp;mm cannon was {{modified}} to be fired from the left <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> of the AC-130. To accommodate the cannon, the rear side-firing 40&thinsp;mm guns were replaced by the radome that formerly had been installed in the door cavity. That change provided enough space for the 105&thinsp;mm gun to be mounted in the doorway {{in place of the}} radome. The gun was first used in the later stages of the Vietnam War and is still used in the AC-130U gunship. The latest AC-130J Ghostrider gunship was not originally planned to include the 105&thinsp;mm, but designed with enough spare power and room to mount it at some later point. The Air Force decided to include it in January 2015, starting installation on the third aircraft, then having the first two be retrofitted when guns become available; M102s will be pulled off retiring AC-130Us and put into the AC-130Js.|$|R
50|$|The RACE {{containers}} {{were developed}} in 1974 in New South Wales by the Public Transport Commission, and built by Freighter Industries Ltd. The RACE general container was designed to accommodate 20 standard 1168 x 1168 mm pallets stacked in two levels. Carrying capacity was 17 t and it had <b>rear</b> and <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> for ease of loading and unloading. There were also ISO RACE containers for non-palletised freight, as well as ventilated, refrigerated and side-loading containers.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{generation}} was launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show, in September 2001. While most competitors severed their connections with their subcompact brethren, Opel decided to base the vehicle on the Corsa again. The use of subcompact Gamma platform constrained the overall {{width of the}} vehicle. While the general body shape was updated to fashionable [...] "flush" [...] look, the front part (up to the A-pillar) is shared with the Corsa. Compared to previous generation, the Combo C gained sliding <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> (versions with either single passenger side door or double doors are available). Sales began in October 2001.|$|E
5000|$|For 1971, {{the lineup}} was trimmed {{down to just}} one Sixty Special model, the Sixty Special Brougham. It still rode on an {{exclusive}} 133.0 in wheelbase, but with all-new sheet metal and a distinctive roof design. The formal new roof was clearly reminiscent of Bill Mitchell's original 1938 Sixty Special, with individually framed, rounded-corner side glass (outlined by a thin chrome bead). Also new on the vinyl top were C-pillar mounted opera lamps and a thick B-pillar - all of which heightened the limousine effect. To complete the [...] "custom-body" [...] look, the front and <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> had a narrow body filler panel between them. Despite the formal new look {{and higher levels of}} luxury, sales dropped slightly from last year, down to 15,200 units.|$|E

5000|$|The Belorussiya class {{ships were}} built with an {{exterior}} appearance {{that was in}} keeping with the aesthetic of the time, described by Douglas Ward in 2006 as being [...] "reasonably smart-looking -- with a square-ish 1970s profile". The hull of the ships had a rounded bow and a rear that tapered inwards so that at the very back the width of the hull was only marginally wider than the width of the large central car-ramp (however, in addition to the ramp at the <b>rear,</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> were fitted on the starboard side) The lowest deck of the superstructure (deck 6) extended slightly beyond the width of the hull, resulting an appearance similar to the overhanging promenade decks of many ocean liners. Deck 6 also extended further than the higher decks of the superstructure, originally in a wedge-like form. The rear decks were tiered, with glass screens protecting the lido area on deck 7. Lifeboats were fairly high in the superstructure. The fairly large funnel included a smoke deflector fin.|$|E
50|$|Lockheed {{responded to}} the {{requirement}} with a unique design: the Lockheed Model 300, the first large jet designed from the start to carry freight. The Model 300 had a swept high-mounted wing with four 21000 lbf kN thrust TF33 turbofan engines pod-mounted below the wings. An important aspect was the cabin's floor height of only 50 in above the ground, allowing {{easy access to the}} cabin through the rear doors. The two <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> were designed to allow the aircraft to drop paratroops (in August 1965 the aircraft performed the first paratroop drop from a jet-powered aircraft). The rear cargo doors could be opened in flight for airborne cargo drops. The high-mounted wings gave internal clearance in the cargo compartment of 10 ft wide, 9 ft high and 70 ft long. The size enabled the Starlifter to carry, for example, a complete LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile in its container. The aircraft was capable of carrying a maximum of 70847 lb over short distances, and up to 92000 lb in the version configured to carry the Minuteman, which lacked other equipment. The aircraft could also carry up to 154 troops, 123 paratroops or 80 litter patients.|$|E
5000|$|As {{well as new}} {{mechanical}} and electronic systems, the Discovery 3 introduced a new design to the interior and exterior of the vehicle. The Discovery 3 was {{able to have a}} fresh, minimalist style. The interior featured a flexible seven-seat layout. Passengers in the rearmost row now entered through the <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors,</b> instead of the tailgate as in previous versions. The driver benefited from a DVD navigation system, including some optional features like Bluetooth telephony in later models. Like the Range Rover, this audio, information & entertainment ("infotainment") system in the Discovery 3 adopted an electronics architecture whereby the system's distributed control units pass information and audio amongst one another and throughout the vehicle via optical links based on the MOST (or, Media Oriented Systems Transport) fibre-optic automotive networking standard (informally called the [...] "MOST-bus"). The system's navigation functions were unique to Land Rover because, in addition to the typical road map navigation, benefits included an off-road navigation and four-wheel drive information mode. When in four-wheel drive information mode, the screen showed a schematic of the vehicle, displaying the amount of suspension movement, angle the front wheels were steering, the status of the locking differentials and icons showing which mode the Terrain Response was in, and what gear was selected on automatic versions.|$|E

5000|$|Clamshell: Full-size General Motors 1971-1976 wagons [...] - [...] the Chevrolet Kingswood, Belair and Caprice Estates; Pontiac Safari and Grand Safari; Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser, and the Buick Estate models [...] - [...] {{featured}} a 'clamshell' design marketed as the Glide-away tailgate, also called a [...] "disappearing" [...] tailgate because when open, the tailgate was {{completely out of}} view. On the clamshell design, the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate (with either manual or optional power operation), lowered completely below the load floor. The manual lower tailgate was counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open, requiring a 35 lb push to fully lower the gate. Raising the manual gate required a 5 lb pull via a handhold integral to {{the top edge of}} the retractable gate. [...] The power operation of both upper glass and lower tailgate became standard equipment in later model years. Wagons with the design {{featured a}}n optional third row of forward-facing seats accessed by the <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> and a folding second-row seat [...] - [...] and could accommodate a 4 x 8' sheet of plywood with rear seats folded.

50|$|Dodge {{pioneered the}} American 15-passenger van genre with the {{introduction}} of the Maxiwagon along with the other front engine B series vans that were new for 1971. Ford didn't produce a 15-passenger van until 1978, and GM did not introduce theirs until 1990. Little changed on Dodge vans produced between 1971 and 1977, with only a grille change from metal to plastic for the 1974 model year. 1978 was a transition year for B series vans, consisting of the nose from 1977 and earlier vans (with a one-year only Dodge symbol in the grille) but with a completely new dashboard and rear end cap. On the standard length vans, the rear end cap just contained new larger tail lamps, but the extended length Maxivan and Maxiwagon had a completely redesigned rear extension which was longer and had large windows that wrapped around the corners for better visibility. This was unique to the B vans, and this same extension was used until the B vans were discontinued in 2003. On the 1971-77 models, the <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> were set back about two feet towards the rear wheelwells, with a filler panel between them and the front doors. Passenger models had a small window between the front and rear doors. Early 1971 vans had black plastic door push buttons, an inlaid pentastar logo low right front fender, drum brakes and points type ignition. 1972 model year began a phase in of chrome door push buttons, electronic ignition, and front disc brakes. In 1978, the filler panel was removed and the doors were moved forward to be next to the front passenger door, similar to the Ford and Chevrolet vans.|$|E
40|$|The study {{presented}} in this thesis focuses on the response of a side impact beam located in a car door to impact loading in close conformation to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 214 (FMVSS 214) standard. The side impact beam is situated in both the front and <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> of a vehicle between {{the inner and outer}} shells to minimise intrusion into the passenger compartment whilst absorbing as much impact energy as possible in a collision. While some manufacturers use tubular side impact beams, others use corrugated structures. Different materials are also considered, depending on the class of vehicle, a nd market for which it is intended. In this study, a numerical model of a light -weight passenger car, developed by the National Crash Analysis Center (NCAC) of The George Washington University under contract with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the United States Department of Transportation (US DOT), was used to simulate a side impact on the front side door using the LS -DYNA R 7. 1. 1 explicit solver. The resulting deformation of the door from the full vehicle model was used to design an experiment for an impact test on a passenger door, which was used to validate an equivalent numerical simulation. In the experiments, the car door was modified and subjected to a drop mass of 385 kg from a height of 1. 27 m. The drop mass and height were chosen such that the maximum deflection in the car door impact test would be of similar magnitude to the deflecti n of the door in full vehicle model when subjected to an impact load in accordance with the FMVSS 214 Standard - which requires that the vehicle be projected into a rigid vertical 10 inch diameter pole at 29 km/h in a direction 75 ° to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. The results from the numerical simulation of the struck door test were in good agreement with the experiments in both shape and magnitude of deformation. The behaviour of the side impact beam located in the passenger door was isolated and further studied. Drop test experiments on beams with square and round cross -sections were carried out to validate the equivalent finite element model. The drop mass and height of the striker was varied such that the transient response of the isolated side impact beam matched the response of the beam in the simulation of the equivalent door model and full vehicle model. In the impact test experiments, the tubular structures were subjected to a 200 kg mass dropped from six incrementally varying heights of 250 - 500 mm. Both square and round tubes were observed to buckle at approximately 835 mm from the free end with different magnitude s of maximum deformation (depending on the drop height). The results from the numerical simulations showed good correlation with the experiments for shape and magnitude of deformation. A quadratic curve fit to the experimental maximum transverse deflection resulted in an R -squared value of 0. 92 and 0. 96 for the square and round tubes respectively. A parametric study was carried out on the side impact beam to investigate the effect of: Thickness and material of a singular tube configuration, and: Inner tube length and outer tube thickness of a compound tube structure. The performance of the different configurations were assessed in terms of Crash Force Efficiency (CFE and Specific Energy Absorption (SEA). A parametric study on the effect of the tube thickness showed that thicker tubes of the same material exhibited deformation of lo wer magnitude and had lower SEA. Aluminium tubes absorbed two or more times the energy per unit mass than the equivalent steel tubes. A round aluminium tube with a thickness of 2. 175 mm was found to give the best balance between SEA and maximum deflection with values of 1. 5 kJ/kg and 350 mm respectively. The compound tube configuration with the inner tube extended beyond the buckling point performed better in terms of SEA and maximum deflection provided the length of the inner tube did not exceed 90 % of the length of the outer tube. The optimised compound tube configuration performed better than the single tube configuration in the full vehicle model with a 1 mm reduction in the overall intrusion of the rigid pole...|$|E
