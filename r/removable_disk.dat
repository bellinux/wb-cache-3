25|$|An {{attempt to}} enhance the {{existing}} 3½-inch designs was the SuperDisk in the late 1990s, utilizing very narrow data tracks and a high precision head guidance mechanism with a capacity of 120 MB and backward-compatibility with standard 3½-inch floppies; a format war briefly occurred between SuperDisk and other high-density floppy-disk products, although ultimately recordable CDs/DVDs, solid-state flash storage, and eventually online storage would render all these <b>removable</b> <b>disk</b> formats obsolete. External USB-based floppy disk drives are still available, and many modern systems provide firmware support for booting from such drives.|$|E
2500|$|Transistorized {{electronics}} improved {{not only}} the CPU (Central Processing Unit), but also the peripheral devices. The second generation disk data storage units were able to store {{tens of millions of}} letters and digits. [...] Next to the fixed disk storage units, connected to the CPU via high-speed data transmission, were <b>removable</b> <b>disk</b> data storage units. A <b>removable</b> <b>disk</b> pack can be easily exchanged with another pack in a few seconds. Even if the removable disks' capacity is smaller than fixed disks, their interchangeability guarantees a nearly unlimited quantity of data close at hand. Magnetic tape provided archival capability for this data, at a lower cost than disk.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1962, IBM {{introduced}} the model 1311 disk drive, {{which was about}} the size of a washing machine and stored two million characters on a <b>removable</b> <b>disk</b> pack. Users could buy additional packs and interchange them as needed, much like reels of magnetic tape. Later models of removable pack drives, from IBM and others, became the norm in most computer installations and reached capacities of 300 megabytes by the early 1980s. Non-removable HDDs were called [...] "fixed disk" [...] drives.|$|E

2500|$|The ZEN Vision was {{released}} on October 1, 2005. Since its launch, it is the winner of several awards, including Best of Digital Life 2005 and the Red dot design award. Unlike its predecessor, the ZEN Vision does not have Microsoft's Portable Media Center interface. [...] It supports audio (WMA-DRM, WMA, MP3, WAV), video (WMV, Motion JPEG, MPEG 1/2/4, DivX 4/5, xvid) and picture (JPEG) playback. The ZEN Vision utilizes a 30GB 1.8-inch Toshiba hard drive and can partition a part of its hard drive {{to work as a}} <b>removable</b> <b>disk</b> (up to 16GB) for any operating system. There are some features of the ZEN Vision which require compatibility with certain operating systems, e.g. require users to have access to Microsoft Windows XP (SP1 or higher).|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, IBM {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} HDD code-named [...] "Winchester". Its primary distinguishing feature was that the disk heads were not withdrawn completely from the stack of disk platters when the drive was powered down. Instead, the heads were allowed to [...] "land" [...] on a special area of the disk surface upon spin-down, [...] "taking off" [...] again when the disk was later powered on. This greatly reduced the cost of the head actuator mechanism, but precluded removing just the disks from the drive as was done with the disk packs of the day. Instead, the first models of [...] "Winchester technology" [...] drives featured a <b>removable</b> <b>disk</b> module, which included both the disk pack and the head assembly, leaving the actuator motor in the drive upon removal. Later [...] "Winchester" [...] drives abandoned the removable media concept and returned to non-removable platters.|$|E

50|$|The small <b>removable</b> <b>disks</b> store 35, 70, or 120 {{gigabytes}} and are hard-drive technology. Like {{a standard}} hard drive, the REV system uses a flying head {{to read and}} write data to a spinning platter. The <b>removable</b> <b>disks</b> contained the platter, spindle, and motor, while the drive heads and drive controller are contained within the REV drive. The drives allow for data transfer rates of about 25 megabytes per second.|$|R
