40|$|In a {{production}} economy, multiple public goods {{are produced by}} firms in competitive markets, and provided by the government together with contributions from consumers. There are widespread externalities: all consumers' consumption and contributions and all firms' production enter into utility functions. Public goods can be imperfect substitutes or complements, {{and they can be}} local public goods or club goods. Zero bounds that require consumers to make nonnegative contributions complicate the differentiable approach. Applying the transversality theorem for smooth economies in a <b>regular</b> <b>parameterization,</b> we obtain the existence of equilibrium in such an economy, and generically equilibria are regular and locally unique.

Both {{the number and}} the locations of cities are endogenously determined. Assuming smooth transportation costs, we examine equilibria in city-economies where {{a finite number of}} cities form endogenously. For any positive integer K, the set of equilibria with K distinct cities has a smooth manifold of dimension K- 1 as its interior for almost all parameter values in a <b>regular</b> <b>parameterization.</b> The disjoint union of these sets over all positive integers K constitutes the entire equilibrium set. city formation, smooth economies, increasing returns, indeterminacy of city systems...|$|E
40|$|Stationary {{subdivision}} is {{an important}} tool for generating smooth free-form surfaces for CAGD and computer graphics. One of the challenges in construction of subdivision schemes for arbitrary meshes is to guarantee that the limit surface will have smooth <b>regular</b> <b>parameterization</b> in a neighborhood of any point. First results in this direction were obtained only recently. In this paper we derive necessary and sufficient criteria for C k -continuity that generalize and extend most known conditions. We create a general mathematical framework {{that can be used}} for analysis of more general types of schemes. Finally, we prove a degree estimate for C k -continuous polynomial schemes generalizing an estimate of Reif [20] and give a practical sufficient condition for smoothness. 1 Introduction The main application of subdivision in computer graphics and CAGD is generation of smooth or piecewise smooth surfaces. Given an initial mesh, subdivision computes a sequence of refined meshes convergi [...] ...|$|E

This description, developed for the case of curvature continuity, significantly narrows the gap between the necessary and known sufficient conditions of compatibility of partial derivatives. Keywords: Geometric continuity of surfaces, curvature continuity, trigonometric splines. INTRODUCTION The geometric continuity of a surface of order r (G r continuity) is defined as the existence of local <b>regular</b> <b>parameterizations,</b> continuous together with partial derivatives up to the order r. In many applications there is a need of constructing G 1 or G 2 continuous surfaces. These properties of surfaces have the geometric interpretation respectively as the continuity of tangent plane and curvature. For special purposes, geometric continuity of even higher order may be required. Various aspects of geometric continuity between t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} multiple-patch phase space method for {{computing}} trajectories on two-dimensional manifolds possibly {{embedded in a}} higher-dimensional space. The dynamics of tra-jectories are given by systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We split the manifold into multiple patches where each patch has a well-defined <b>regular</b> <b>parameterization.</b> The ODEs are formulated as escape equations, which are hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) in a three-dimensional phase space. The escape equations are solved in each patch, individually. The solutions of individual patches are then connected using suitable inter-patch boundary conditions. Properties for particular families of trajectories are obtained through a fast post-processing. We apply the method to two different problems: the creeping ray contribution to mono-static radar cross section computations and the multivalued travel-time of seismic waves in multi-layered media. We present numerical examples to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the method. Key words.

40|$|Geometry images {{resample}} {{meshes to}} represent them as texture for efficient GPU processing by forcing a <b>regular</b> <b>parameterization</b> that often incurs {{a large amount of}} distortion. Previous approaches broke the geometry image into multiple rectangular or irregular charts to reduce distortion, but complicated the automatic level of detail one gets from MIP-maps of the geometry image. We introduce triangular-chart geometry images and show this new approach better supports the GPU-side representation and display of skinned dynamic meshes, with support for feature preservation, bounding volumes and view-dependent level of detail. Triangular charts pack efficiently, simplify the elimination of T-junctions, arise naturally from an edge-collapse simplification base mesh, and layout more flexibly to allow their edges to follow curvilinear mesh features. To support the construction and application of triangular-chart geometry images, this paper introduces a new spectral clustering method for feature detection, and new methods for incorporating skinning weights and skinned bounding boxes into the representation. This results in a ten-fold improvement in fidelity when compared to quadchart geometry images...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{unresolved}} {{subtleties of}} floating point computations in geometric modeling become considerably more difficult in animations and scientific visualizations. Some emerging solutions based upon topological considerations for curves will be presented. A novel geometric seeding algorithm for Newton’s method {{was used in}} experiments to determine feasible support for these visualization applications. 1 Computing the Pipe Surface Radius Parametric curves {{have been shown to}} have a particular neighborhood whose boundary is non-self-intersecting [9]. It has also been shown that specified movements of the curve within this neighborhood preserve the topology of the curve [12, 13], as is desired in visualization. This neighborhood is defined by a single value, which is the radius of a pipe surface, where that radius depends on curvature and the minimum length over those line segments which are normal to the curve at both endpoints of the line segment [9]. Since computation of curvature is a well-treated problem, the focus of this paper is efficient and accurate floating point techniques to compute the other dependency for that radius. Definition 1. For a non-self-intersecting, parametric curve c, where c:[0, 1] → R 3, and for distinct 1 values s, t ∈ [0, 1], then the line segment [c(s),c(t) ] is doubly normal if it is normal to c at both of the points c(s) and c(t). To avoid unnecessary complications with computing derivatives, only curves with <b>regular</b> <b>parameterization</b> [7] are considered. Definition 2. The global separation is the minimum over the lengths of all doubly normal segments. (For compact curves, this minimum has been shown in be positive [10]. ...|$|E
