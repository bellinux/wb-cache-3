50|$|Similar to humans, social {{structure}} {{plays an important}} role in cultural transmission in chimpanzees. Victoria Horner conducted an experiment where an older, higher <b>ranking</b> <b>individual</b> and a younger, lower <b>ranking</b> <b>individual</b> were both taught the same task with only slight aesthetic modification. She found that chimpanzees tended to imitate the behaviors of the older, higher ranking chimpanzee as opposed to the younger, lower <b>ranking</b> <b>individual</b> when given a choice. It is believed that the older higher <b>ranking</b> <b>individual</b> had gained a level of 'prestige' within the group. This research demonstrates that culturally transmitted behaviors are often learned from individuals that are respected by the group.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that perceptions of social class rank influence {{a variety of social}} cognitive tendencies, from patterns of causal attribution to moral judgment. In the present studies we tested the hypotheses that upper-class <b>rank</b> <b>individuals</b> {{would be more likely to}} endorse essentialist lay theories of social class categories (i. e., that social class is founded in genetically based, biological differences) than would lower-class <b>rank</b> <b>individuals</b> and that these beliefs would decrease support for restorative justice—which seeks to rehabilitate offenders, rather than punish unlawful action. Across studies, higher social class rank was associated with increased essentialism of social class categories (Studies 1, 2, and 4) and decreased support for restorative justice (Study 4). Moreover, manipulated essentialist beliefs decreased preferences for restor-ative justice (Study 3), and the association between social class rank and class-based essentialist theories was explained by the tendency to endorse beliefs in a just world (Study 2). Implications for how class-based essentialist beliefs potentially constrain social opportunity and mobility are discussed...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that dominance-subordinate {{interactions}} form an important part of social organisation in primitively eusocial wasps (1). In many studies of social insects, the rank of an animal is based merely on the frequency with which it shows dominance behaviour. This is misleading because a high frequency of dominance behaviour may be accompanied by an equally high frequency of subordinate behaviour. Moreover showing dominance over a high <b>ranking</b> <b>individual</b> should be weighed differently from showing dominance over a low <b>ranking</b> <b>individual.</b> For these reasons, we have used {{a modified version of the}} index of fighting success that was developed for red deer to solve similar problems(2) ...|$|R
