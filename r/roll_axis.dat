5|$|As the {{computor}} {{held the}} level line and was sending angle commands to the sight, it eliminated {{the need for}} a two-axis gyro in the sighting head itself. The gyro on the sight head only adjusted for rotation of the aircraft around its <b>roll</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (<b>roll)</b> <b>axis</b> of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
5|$|The {{avionics}} software {{incorporates the}} concept of open architecture. Instead of the military-optimised Ada programming language, the software is written using the popular C++ programming language, enabling {{the use of the}} numerous civilian programmers available. The aircraft also includes a health and usage monitoring system, and automatic test equipment. The flight control system (FCS) comprises conventional controls with stability augmentation in the yaw and <b>roll</b> <b>axis</b> and a digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system in the pitch axis. The leading edge slats/flaps and trailing edge flaps are automatically adjusted during manoeuvring to increase turning performance. The FCS of serial production aircraft reportedly have a digital quadruplex (quad-redundant) FBW system in the pitch axis and a duplex (dual-redundant) FBW system in the roll and yaw axis.|$|E

5000|$|Six {{degrees of}} freedom (6DoF) refers to the freedom of {{movement}} of a rigid body in three-dimensional space. Specifically, the body is free to change position as forward/backward (surge), up/down (heave), left/right (sway) translation in three perpendicular axes, combined with changes in orientation through rotation about three perpendicular axes, often termed yaw (normal axis), pitch (lateral <b>axis),</b> and <b>roll</b> (longitudinal <b>axis).</b>|$|R

50|$|These {{systems are}} all remote {{controlled}} gyroscopic assisted stabilizing platforms. They utilize {{a series of}} spinning fly wheels and electronics to dampen the angular disturbances. They are mostly used for helicopter work but {{can also be used}} for camera car, crane, or suspended cable systems. The A-1 systems do not have steerability of the <b>roll</b> (dutch) <b>axis,</b> only horizon leveling. These systems as well as the (A), will eliminate almost all of the angular disturbances. The drawback is that the (A-1) systems are closed architecture systems. The DP can only utilize the offered one or two cameras and lens combinations, normally a Mitchell R35 camera and a 10:1 zoom lens.|$|R

25|$|In {{spacecraft}} propulsion, rocket {{engines are}} generally {{mounted on a}} pair of gimbals to allow a single engine to vector thrust about both the pitch and yaw axes; or sometimes just one axis is provided per engine.

25|$|In {{order to}} make the {{aircraft}} more manoeuvrable and in particular to increase its roll rate, a triplane configuration was chosen. This provided about the same total wing area as that of the biplane Scout with a lower moment of inertia about the <b>roll</b> <b>axis.</b> The Triplane had single-bay wings with heavy stagger, carrying six ailerons. The lower wing was close to the ground so two underwing skids were added below the interplane struts. The mid-line of the nacelle, with the engine at its rear, was on the centre plane, giving the pilot a slightly inferior view than from the Scout.|$|E

"One of {{the more}} {{interesting}} experiments undertaken to extend the range of the early jets in order to give fighter protection to the piston-engine bombers, was the provision for inflight attachment/detachment of fighter to bomber via wingtip connections. One of the several programs during these experiments was done with a B-29 mother ship and two F-84D 'children', and was code named 'Tip Tow'. A number of flights were undertaken, with several successful cycles of attachment and detachment, using, first one, and then two F-84s. The pilots of the F-84s maintained manual control when attached, with <b>roll</b> <b>axis</b> maintained by elevator movement rather than aileron movement. Engines on the F-84s were shut down in order to save fuel during the 'tow' by the mother ship, and inflight engine restarts were successfully accomplished. The experiment ended in disaster during the first attempt to provide automatic flight control of the F-84s, when the electronics apparently malfunctioned. The left hand F-84 rolled onto the wing of the B-29, and the connected aircraft both crashed with loss of all on board personnel (Anderson had uncoupled so did not crash with the other two aircraft)." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{second major}} {{change to the}} RB-57D was the {{addition}} of Pratt & Whitney J57 engines {{in place of the}} Wright J65 engines used on all earlier B-57 models. The two J57 engines produced about [...] total thrust, about [...] more than the two J65 engines. Other changes in the D model included removal of all fuselage fuel tanks and the addition of [...] "wet wing" [...] fuel cells. All defensive armament was removed, and the bomb bay was also removed and replaced by avionics equipment. The horizontal stabilizer was changed to the variable incidence or [...] "all flying" [...] type. Spoilers were added to the outboard wings to assist the ailerons in <b>roll</b> <b>axis</b> control.|$|E
50|$|In a {{turn the}} sprung {{mass of the}} vehicle's body {{produces}} a lateral force at the centre of gravity (CG), proportional to lateral acceleration. Because the CG is usually not on the <b>roll</b> <b>axis,</b> the lateral force creates a moment about the <b>roll</b> <b>axis</b> that tends to roll the body.

To get the video or images that have good quality then it is used gimbal camera as a movement stabilizer and vibration damping. Stabilization System consists of two axes, x <b>axis</b> (<b>roll)</b> and y <b>axis</b> (pitch) and has a 2 -axis camera gimbal controller which is have microcontroller ATMEGA 328 that serves to regulate the stability of the gimbal camera. The Input of this system is derived from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors that are within the sensor module MPU 6050, to determine the tilt position of hexacopter. The output of this sensor will be filtered first using complementary filters that serve to reduce noise of both sensors and complement advantages and disadvantages of each sensor. The output of this system is the movement of two brushless motors, brushless roll and pitch, that are controlled with Sugeno fuzzy logic method because it has a simple calculation so the response is faster and more suitable for real-time applications.

50|$|Forcing the gimbal {{to rotate}} causes {{the wheel to}} precess {{resulting}} in gyroscopic torques about the <b>roll</b> <b>axis,</b> so that the mechanism {{has the potential to}} right the vehicle when tilted from the vertical.

50|$|As the {{aircraft}} yaws, a torque {{force is applied}} to the gyro around the vertical axis, due to aircraft yaw, which causes gyro precession around the <b>roll</b> <b>axis.</b> The gyro spins on an axis that is 90 degrees relative to the direction of the applied yaw torque force.
