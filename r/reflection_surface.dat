The method utilizes {{a limited number of}} on-site channel sounding to extract reflected multipaths, and compare them with ray-tracing based on the environmental database. The permittivity of the identified <b>reflection</b> <b>surfaces</b> is estimated by solving an inverse reflection problem. The method was experimentally tested with limited radio channel measurements at 60 GHz in a large empty office room. The identified <b>reflection</b> <b>surfaces</b> are classified according to their mean permittivity estimates, showing their consistency with physical material evidence and the permittivity database in the ITU recommendation. The estimated permittivity values are visualized as a three-dimensional map, giving intuitive understanding of materials constituting the environment.

In the dHT frame, the solar wind flows parallel to the IMF by construction, such that no convection electric field exists. Also, this frame moves purely laterally relative to the obstacle surface; therefore, given a laterally homogenous obstacle, we can treat it as stationary in the dHT frame. As a result, any adiabatic reflection process perfectly conserves energy in the dHT frame, with parallel velocities reversed and perpendicular velocities unchanged for reflecting particles. For this frame transformation, we assume that any <b>reflection</b> <b>surface</b> lies parallel to the lunar surface, at the footpoint of the field line.

30|$|The {{decrease}} in velocity under an observation station represents one {{interpretation of the}} cause of a phase delay. When a wave reflects off a surface and returns to the station, a phase delay is observed if the seismic wave velocity decreases along the propagation path. The delay can also be explained by an increase in the distance between an observation station and a <b>reflection</b> <b>surface,</b> because the propagation distance of the reflected wave is determined by the distance between an observation station and a <b>reflection</b> <b>surface.</b> Assuming that the distance to the <b>reflection</b> <b>surface</b> did not change, the observed phase delays after the main shock were equivalent to a 2 % or lower seismic velocity decrease at six stations (TJT 2, S 15, S 09, S 04, LS 4, and LS 1) near the trench. Ito and Hino (2013) studied the sea floor in the same region as the present study, and detected decreases in seismic velocity of 1 – 5 % after the main shock in the overall analysis region. Moreover, a {{decrease in}} seismic velocity of 2 % in the southern Fukushima Prefecture (Minato et al. 2012) and 0.1 – 0.5 % in the Iwate Prefecture (Takagi et al. 2012) were reported after the main shock using land data.

We analyze the intensity of the <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> measured by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) ionospheric radar sounder on board the Mars Express spacecraft. Apart from the surface reflectivity and the spacecraft altitude, the detected intensity of <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> is controlled primarily by the signal attenuation during the ionospheric propagation. We focus on the nightside region, where the ionospheric densities in the main layer are too low to cause a significant attenuation and allow sampling of the <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> at frequencies down to 3 MHz. The attenuation occurs mainly at altitudes below 100 km, where the electron-neutral collision frequency is a maximum. The intensity of <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> can thus serve as a proxy for electron densities at low altitudes not accessible by the direct ionospheric {{radar sounding}}. We analyze the intensity of <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> as a function of relevant controlling parameters. The intensity of <b>surface</b> <b>reflections</b> is lower at higher solar zenith angles on the nightside and during the periods of larger solar activity.
