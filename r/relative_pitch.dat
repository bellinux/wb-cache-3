5|$|The basic {{component}} {{sound of a}} Hammond organ comes from a tonewheel. Each one rotates {{in front of an}} electromagnetic pickup. The variation in the magnetic field induces a small alternating current at a particular frequency, which represents a signal similar to a sine wave. When a key is pressed on the organ, it completes a circuit of nine electrical switches, which are linked to the drawbars. The position of the drawbars, combined with the switches selected by the key pressed, determines which tonewheels are allowed to sound. Every tonewheel is connected to a synchronous motor via a system of gears, which ensures that each note remains at a constant <b>relative</b> <b>pitch</b> to every other. The combined signal from all depressed keys and pedals is fed through to the vibrato system, which is driven by a metal scanner. As the scanner rotates around a set of pickups, it changes the pitch of the overall sound slightly. From here, the sound is sent to the main amplifier, and on to the audio speakers.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two methods}} of encoding/remembering music. The first process {{is known as}} <b>relative</b> <b>pitch,</b> which refers to a person's ability to {{identify}} the intervals between given tones. Therefore, the song is learned as a continuous succession of intervals. Some people can also use absolute pitch in the process; this is ability to name or replicate a tone without reference to an external standard. <b>Relative</b> <b>pitch</b> has also been credited by some with being the more sophisticated of the two processes as it allows for quick recognition regardless of pitch, timbre or quality, as well as having the ability to produce physiological responses, for example, if the melody violates the learned <b>relative</b> <b>pitch.</b> <b>Relative</b> <b>pitch</b> {{has been shown to}} develop at varying rates dependent on culture. Trehub and Schellenberg (2008) found that 5- and 6-year-old Japanese children performed significantly better at a task requiring the utilization of <b>relative</b> <b>pitch</b> than same-aged Canadian children. They hypothesized that this could be because the Japanese children have more exposure to pitch accent via Japanese language and culture than the predominantly stressed environment Canadian children experience.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 20 th century, various {{theories}} have been advanced {{in order to}} mathematically explain and notate modes of Traditional Turkish music known as maqams. In this article, maqam scales according to various theoretical models based on different tunings are compared with pitch measurements obtained from select recordings of master Turkish performers in order to study their level of match with analysed data. Chosen recordings are subjected to a fully computerized sequence of signal processing algorithms for the automatic determination of the set of <b>relative</b> <b>pitches</b> for each maqam scale: f 0 estimation, histogram computation, tonic detection + histogram alignment, and peak picking. For nine well-recognized maqams, automatically derived <b>relative</b> <b>pitches</b> are compared with scale tones defined by theoretical models using quantitative distance measures. We analyse and interpret histogram peaks based on these measures to find the theoretical models most conforming with all the recordings, and hence, with the quotidian performance trends influenced by them.

25|$|Many musicians {{have quite}} good <b>relative</b> <b>pitch,</b> {{a skill that}} can be learned through ear training. With practice, it is {{possible}} to listen to a single known pitch once (from a pitch pipe or a tuning fork) and then have stable, reliable pitch identification by comparing the notes heard to the stored memory of the tonic pitch. Unlike absolute pitch, this skill is dependent on a recently perceived tonal center.|$|E
25|$|Early {{acquisition}} of <b>relative</b> <b>pitch</b> allows for accelerated learning of scales and intervals. Musical training assists with the attentional and executive functioning necessary to interpret and efficiently encode music. In conjunction with brain plasticity, these processes {{become more and}} more stable. However, this process expresses a degree of circular logic in that the more learning that takes place, the greater the stability of the processes, ultimately decreasing overall brain plasticity. This could possibly explain the discrepancy in amount of effort both children and adults have to put into mastering new tasks.|$|E
25|$|In Indian {{classical}} music and Indian light music, the mandolin, which bears {{little resemblance to}} the European mandolin, is usually tuned E–B–E–B. As there is no concept of absolute pitch in Indian {{classical music}}, any convenient tuning maintaining these <b>relative</b> <b>pitch</b> intervals between the strings can be used. Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is C–G–C–G, which corresponds to sa–pa–sa–pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style. This tuning corresponds to the way violins are tuned for carnatic classical music. This type of mandolin is also used in Bhangra, dance music popular in Punjabi culture.|$|E

25|$|Prior to playing, the timpanist must {{clear the}} heads by {{equalizing}} the tension at each tuning screw. This is done so every spot is tuned to {{exactly the same}} pitch. When the head is clear, the timpani will produce an in-tune sound. If the head is not clear, the pitch will rise or fall after the initial impact of a stroke, and the drum will produce different pitches at different dynamic levels. Timpanists are required to have a well-developed sense of <b>relative</b> <b>pitch</b> and must develop techniques to tune in an undetectable manner and accurately {{in the middle of}} a performance. Tuning is often tested with a light tap from a finger, which produces a near-silent note.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{classical}} Western music, Carnatic {{music is}} notated {{almost exclusively in}} tonic sol-fa notation using either a Roman or Indic script to represent the solfa names. Past attempts to use the staff notation have mostly failed. Indian music makes use of hundreds of ragas, many more than the church modes in Western music. It becomes difficult to write Carnatic music using the staff notation {{without the use of}} too many accidentals. Furthermore, the staff notation requires that the song be played in a certain key. The notions of key and absolute pitch are deeply rooted in Western music, whereas the Carnatic notation does not specify the key and prefers to use scale degrees (<b>relative</b> <b>pitch)</b> to denote notes. The singer is free to choose the actual pitch of the tonic note. In the more precise forms of Carnatic notation, there are symbols placed above the notes indicating how the notes should be played or sung; however, informally this practice is not followed.|$|E
25|$|Lego Rock Band {{is based}} {{primarily}} on the same gameplay as the main Rock Band series, though it includes aspects of collecting and building with Lego bricks as in Traveller's Tales's other Lego-themed games. Up to four local players can play lead and bass guitar, drums, or vocals across the songs in the game using specially designed Rock Band or Guitar Hero controllers. During each song, players attempt to match notes (shown as Lego bricks) as they scroll on-screen {{in time with the}} current song. On lead and bass guitar, notes are hit by holding down the frets indicated on-screen and using the controller's strum bar when the note passes through the target area of the track.

500|$|As with {{previous}} {{games in the}} series, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock is a rhythm game, allowing up to four people play in a band on vocals, lead and bass/rhythm guitar, and drums, to use special instrument controllers to simulate the playing of rock music. In general, the goal for each player is to match scrolling note gems that correspond to that instrument's part in the given song to score points; the guitar and bass player must hold down the appropriate colored buttons on the controller and then use the strum bar as the notes pass over a marked zone; the drummer must strike the matching drum pads on the controller when the notes pass, and the vocalist must match the <b>relative</b> <b>pitch</b> of the song's lyrics as guided by phrase markers. Successfully striking notes earns points and boosts the player's performance meter; missing notes will cause this meter to drop. When playing by one's self, if the performance meter should empty, the song will end and require the player to restart it; when playing in a band, the remaining band members must play well enough for a limited time to [...] "revive" [...] a player that has fallen out due to an empty performance meter, or else the whole band will fail the song. Prior {{to the start of}} a song, each player can select one of five difficulty levels: Beginner, Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert, with a sixth difficulty of Expert+ available to some songs on the drums which introduces a double bass pedal. Harder difficulties have characters with high note densities and more difficult playing techniques; each player can select their own difficulty to play.|$|E

Another form of early notation used a system of letters corresponding to different pitches, much as Shaker music is notated.|$|R
