40|$|This paper {{presents}} an interleaved active-clamping zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) forward-flyback converter without an output choke. The presented topology has two active-clamping circuits with two separated transformers. Because of the interleaved {{operation of the}} converter, the output current ripple will be reduced. The proposed converter can approximately share the total load current between the two secondaries. Therefore, the transformer copper loss and the rectifier diodes conduction loss can be decreased. The output capacitor is made of two series capacitors which reduces the <b>peak</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> of the rectifier diodes. The circuit has no output inductor and few semiconductor elements, such that the adopted circuit has a simpler structure, a lower cost and is suitable for high power density applications.

40|$|The {{physical}} size of inductors in resonant converters {{was examined}} {{in terms of}} inductor to transformer size ratio. Following the general discussion of the issue, the inductor size in series resonant DC-DC converter is examined in detail. It is shown that the inductor to transformer size ratio {{is a function of}} the peak voltage of the inductor to the rms voltage of the transformer and is independent of the inductance. The physical size of the inductor could be much larger than the transformer when the converter operates near resonance. Away from resonance, the inductor size becomes close to, and even smaller, than the transformer. Leakage inductance of the transformer can be used as the resonant inductance but if the leakage is associated with the secondary windings of the transformer, it will increase the <b>peak</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> of the rectifier diodes when a center-tapped rectifier topology is used.

One method commonly used to improve the dynamic performance of on-off valves involves modifying the electrical input signal to the solenoids to reduce the inductive lag and eddy current decay. This research examined two commercially available direct actuated and pilot-stage actuated cartridge poppet valves and the role of peak-and-hold <b>voltage</b> and <b>reverse</b> current input profiles on opening and closing switching times. A test stand was built to characterize the performance of these valves. The valves were placed between two high frequency pressure transducers and the pressure differential across the valves was recorded, allowing the calculation of transition and delay time. The <b>peak</b> and <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> duration was tested over a range of zero to ten milliseconds and an optimum response was found at a peak duration of six to eight milliseconds. Peak voltages ranged from 50 to 55 volts, followed by a holding voltage of 12 volts. Reverse current profiles were used to turn off the valves with a maximum peak current of three amps. The reverse current was used to increase the decay rate of eddy currents thus improving the turning off performance of the valves. Commercial valves that had a range of 33 to 55 millisecond turn-on response without input signal modification; these same valves had response times reduced to a range of seven to nine milliseconds after applying the peak and hold method. The turn-off time was reduced from 130 milliseconds to a range of 16 to 50 milliseconds after adding reverse current inputs. This improvement in valve performance can lead to siginificant energy savings due to reduction of transition losses and can widen the useful application of the valves...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a new {{topology}} with a <b>reversing</b> <b>voltage</b> component is proposed which {{will improve the}} multilevel performance by compensating the disadvantages of increased number of components, complex pulse width modulation control method and voltage balancing problem. This topology requires fewer components compared to existing inverter topologies (particularly in higher levels) and requires fewer carrier signals and gate drives. Therefore the overall cost and complexity are greatly reduced particularly for higher output voltage levels. This paper describes the general multilevel inverter schematic and modified circuit having only seven switches for seven- level multilevel inverter using <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> topology. A general method of multilevel modulation phase disposition (PD) SPWM is utilized to drive the inverter and can be extended to any number of voltage levels.

Electrical tests included both steady state and dynamic tests. Steady state tests produced forward and reverse I-V characteristic curves. Transient tests evaluated the switching performance of the diodes in either a hard-switched DC to DC buck converter or a half-bridge boost converter. For evaluation and comparison purposes, the same tests were performed with current state-of-the-art ultra fast silicon (Si) pn-junction diodes of similar ratings and also a Si Schottky diode. The comparisons made were forward voltage drop at rated current, reverse current at rated <b>voltage,</b> and turn-off <b>peak</b> <b>reverse</b> recovery current and reverse recovery time. In addition, efficiency measurements were taken for the buck DC to DC converter using both the SiC Schottky diodes and the Si pn-junction diodes at different temperatures and frequencies. The test results showed that at high temperature, the forward voltage drop for SiC Schottky diodes is higher than the forward drop of the ultra fast Si pn-junction diodes. As the temperature increased, the forward voltage drop of the SiC Schottky increased while for the ultra fast Si pn-junction diodes, the forward voltage drop decreased as temperature increased. For the elevated temperature steady state <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> tests, the SiC Schottky diodes showed low leakage current at their rated voltage. Likewise, for the transient tests, the SiC Schottky diodes displayed low reverse recovery currents over the range of temperatures tested. Conversely, the Si pn-junction diodes showed increasing <b>peak</b> <b>reverse</b> current values and reverse recovery times with increasing temperature. Efficiency measurements in the DC to DC buck converter showed the advantage of the SiC Schottky diodes over the ultra fast Si pn-junction diodes, especially at the higher temperatures and higher frequencies...|$|R
