5000|$|The extra tension {{placed on}} the {{instrument}} by the doubled strings is high, {{and because of this}} additional stress on their necks and soundboards, twelve-string guitars long had a reputation for warping after a few years of use. (This is less of a problem in modern instruments, built after 1970.) Until the invention of the truss rod in 1921, twelve-string guitars were frequently tuned lower than the traditional EADGBE to reduce the stresses on the instrument. Lead Belly often used a low C-tuning, but in some recordings his tunings can be recognized as low B and A-tunings. Some twelve-string guitars have non-traditional structural supports to prevent or postpone warping, at the expense of appearance and tone. For additional reduction of the stress of the added string tension, twelve-string guitars built prior to 1970 typically had shorter necks and fretboards than six-string guitars did, and their fretting scales were also shorter, which meant that the fret positions were more closely spaced as well. Their bridges, especially in acoustic guitars, had a larger <b>reinforcement</b> <b>plate</b> for the same reason. (See above.) ...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{has been}} carried out at Ferruform AB, which is a wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of Scania AB. Ferruform produces rear axle housings, cross members, side members and bumpers for trucks and busses. Ferruform is constantly working to improve their production and a part of these improvements are to raise the internal quality and thus reduce waste. A problem that exists today is to ensure the quality of the rear axles manufactured in the manual welding line. The purpose of this work was to identify the root causes of these problems and find solutions to eliminate them. The work would also introduce and evaluate a methodology for problem solving. The problem solving methodology used in this work is called " 8 -stegsmodellen". This methodology is in use at Scania, but was {{at the time of this}} work not introduced at Ferruform. The work was limited to examining the problem of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>plates</b> that are welded on the manual welding line. Data and information was gathered through interviews, observations, and internal quality reports. Based on the completed analysis, the study shows that the problems with the placement of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>plates</b> have three root causes: • Ferruforms collaboration with the design department in Södertälje has not been good enough in the product development process. • Positioning accuracy of the spring brackets are not sufficient enough, for both the physical location and the requirement by drawing. • The working methods for the manual work are not guaranteed in terms of quality. Based on the defined problems a proposal of solutions where created to eliminate the problems. The final chosen solution means that the design of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>plates</b> is changed and a reference track is created on the plate. This reference track allows Ferruform to both fixture and control the placement of the plate against the current drawing requirements. Further work should be done to improve and enhance the cooperation between Ferruform, as a production unit, and the design department in Södertälje. This should be done early in the product development process to ensure possibility for robust and productive fixation and the ability to control the outcome of the placement of the details.

However, a higher failure rate has been reported in large Paprosky IIIB defects compared with smaller Paprosky II-IIIA defects. This study aims to investigate the effect of cage support on cage failure by means of finite element analysis. The Von Mises stresses in both the implant and the bone are analyzed for a Burch-Schneider cage used in the following scenarios: (1) a large acetabular bone defect, (2) a small acetabular bone defect and (3) a large acetabular bone defect in combination with a <b>reinforcement</b> <b>plate.</b> The results show that implant and bone stresses are higher in the large defect (99 th percentile of 146. 6 and 73. 5 MPa respectively) than in the small defect (99 th percentile of 43. 9 and 47. 9 MPa respectively). Adding a <b>reinforcement</b> <b>plate</b> to posteriorly support the cage decreases the stresses but not fully compensates for the missing bone support (99 th percentile of 93. 1 and 55. 3 MPa respectively).

The test showed that the external <b>reinforcement</b> (<b>plates)</b> increased the flexural stiffness of the beam at all stages of loading, and consequently reduced the deflection at corresponding loads.

40|$|In today's society {{it becomes}} more and more {{necessary}} to build high houses. Floors are added on existing buildings, which mean that the supporting structure must be reinforced to handle the extra load. In this thesis a pillar structure of steel is studied were the cross-section is reinforced by plates on each flange. When design of reinforced steel columns, according to Eurocode 3, the reinforced cross-section is designed as a new cross-section and all loads imposed in one step. In the real case, when the higher load is applied it gives a deflection, which in turn gives an additional deflection of the existing load. In addition, yielding can occur in parts of the cross-section that reduces bending stiffness and provides a lower failure load. The aim of this thesis is to give an indication {{of the degree to which}} <b>reinforcement</b> <b>plates</b> need to be increased when the residual stress and partial yielding is considered. The work was done with an analytical solution based on Eurocode 3. The thesis consisted largely of finding effective methods of calculation which made it possible to conduct a parametric study. The study has been carried out both analytically and with FE-analysis. The results have a high level of agreement and the numerical calculation is therefore verified. The results of the study show that at high slenderness where utilization of the existing pillar is high, design according to Eurocode 3 is not on the safe side. When residual stress and partial yielding is counted for, the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>plates</b> at slenderness 100 needs to be increased by approximately 55 % - 100 % to cope with a design load of 1. 5 of the existing load in comparison with design with Eurocode 3.

We experienced dislodgement of the cemented cup from the Müller ring after the third-revision THA. In this regard, Stöckl et al.

In addition, as we described in previous three-dimensional finite element analysis of the acetabular cup (Oki et al. 2004), the direction of the maximal resultant force acting on the hip is only about 10 degrees medial from the vertical direction in a frontal plane above the centre of the femoral head, and the shear stress on the surface of the polyethylene cup increases significantly with increases in abduction angle. We also speculated that the reason for the dislodgement of the cemented cup was the lateral positioning of the cemented cup relative to the original acetabular position, with no adequate coverage of the weight-bearing portion. This was mainly due to the large distance between the Müller ring and the host bone, the small vertical setting angle of the support ring, and instability of the region of pelvic discontinuity due to inadequate stabilization.|$|E

Despite the warnings by Addink, Van Doorne pretended that he was unconcerned. Nevertheless the May 1939 contract had contained a warranty clause, instructing DAF to weld all connections tension-free and making DAF liable for all defects of this nature. Late March 1940 during cleaning it was discovered that on three of the six vehicles the welds of the machine gun mounts were cracking. One vehicle was sent to DAF that rewelded the crack and reinforced the glacis by riveting a steel plate behind it. Soon however, it transpired that next to the reinforcing plate a new crack had appeared. In April the number of cars showing cracks had risen to five and on some of these the welds between the glacis and bottom plates were starting to crack also. According to DAF the defects had been caused by attaching the mounts after the vehicles had been largely finished. The Comissie Pantserautomobielen concluded that, as war was imminent, DAF should be allowed to quickly repair the cracks by rewelding and fitting <b>reinforcement</b> <b>plates</b> but that ultimately the armour plates had to be completely replaced.|$|R
50|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} is concrete {{in which}} steel <b>reinforcement</b> bars ("rebars"), <b>plates</b> or fibers have been incorporated to strengthen a material {{that would otherwise}} be brittle. In industrialised countries, nearly all concrete used in construction is reinforced concrete. Due to its weakness in tension capacity, concrete will fail suddenly and in brittle manner under flexural (bending) or tensile force unless adequately reinforced with steel.|$|R
