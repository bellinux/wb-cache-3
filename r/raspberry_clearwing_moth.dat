50|$|These moths {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the Hemaris genus of the family Sphingidae, which are also known as <b>clearwing</b> <b>moths</b> in the U.S., but normally as bee hawk-moths in Britain. Hemaris moths have generally fatter, furrier bodies than sesiid clearwings, looking similar to bumble bees, and lack the striped colouration.|$|R

5000|$|This is a {{steeply sloping}} hill, {{which is a}} fine example of grazed chalk {{grassland}} in the southern Buckinghamshire Chilterns. There is a wide variety of plants, some of which provide food for the larvae of important butterflies on the site. Two butterflies are rare, the silver spotted skipper [...] and the Adonis blue. Another rare invertebrate is the orange <b>clearwing</b> <b>moth.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sesioidea is the {{superfamily}} currently containing <b>clearwing</b> <b>moths</b> (Sesiidae), castniid moths (Castniidae) {{and little}} bear moths (Brachodidae). There is evidence from head and thoracic morphology {{that the first}} two families, internally feeding in plants as caterpillars, are sisters, whilst some brachodids are known to feed on leaf surfaces (Edwards et al., 1999). Sesioidea {{are considered to be}} the sister group of Cossoideahttp://tolweb.org/Apoditrysia which contain the also internal-feeding Goat and Leopard moths.|$|R
50|$|Synanthedon myopaeformis is a moth of {{the family}} Sesiidae. In Europe it {{is known as the}} red-belted clearwing and in North America as the apple <b>clearwing</b> <b>moth.</b> The larvae create {{galleries}} under the bark of fruit trees, especially old ones with damaged trunks. This moth is native to Europe, the Near East and North Africa but has been introduced into North America, being first detected in Canada in 2005.|$|R

40|$|A {{new species}} of long-legged <b>clearwing</b> <b>moth</b> Teinotarsina aurantiaca Yagi, Hirowatari & Arita, sp. n. is {{described}} from Okinawa-jima, the Ryukyus, Japan. The species is distinguishable at a glance from other related congeners by the remarkable orange scales ornamenting {{many parts of the}} body, such as antennae, palpi, legs, and wings. We hypothesize that the species acquired these differences as a result of convergence with toxic species (Batesian mimicry) or other mimics (Müllerian mimicry) ...|$|R
50|$|Chalk {{grassland}} {{also supports}} a rich fauna, particularly insects. Notable butterfly species include Adonis blue (Lysandra bellargus) and silver-spotted skipper (Hesperia comma) {{which may be}} found on warm, sheltered, south facing slopes. The chalk downland above the Stour Valley is the only British site for the black-veined moth (Siona lineata). Other notable moth species that occur on the North Downs include the fiery <b>clearwing</b> <b>moth</b> (Bembecia chrysidiformis) and the straw belle moth (Aspitates gilvaria).|$|R
40|$|A {{new species}} of <b>clearwing</b> <b>moth,</b> Pyrophleps ellawi Skowron Volponi, sp. n., is {{described}} from Peninsular Malaysia. Information on the habitat, time and conditions of occurrence, flight and mud-puddling behaviour, functional morphology, and DNA barcode are also provided. Photographs and a supplementary video from the wild demonstrate the postures and behaviour of this species of Pyrophleps, whose remaining members were described only {{on the basis of}} pinned specimens. This is the first record of this genus in Peninsular Malaysia...|$|R
50|$|In Europe and the Middle East, Synanthedon myopaeformis {{has been}} {{regarded}} as a minor pest of fruit trees, but changes in orchard technology since the 1960s have led to it becoming a more serious pest. The larvae weaken the host tree, reduce the crop yield and make the tree more susceptible to attack by fungal diseases. Some control is offered by the wasp Liotryphon crassiseta, the larvae of which are parasitoids of the <b>clearwing</b> <b>moth</b> larvae.|$|R
40|$|A {{new species}} of Sesiidae, Carmenta chromolaenae Eichlin, is {{described}} to make the name available to researchers evaluating the moth's potential for biological control of its host plant, Chromolaena odorata, in South Africa {{and other parts of}} the plant's invasive range. This <b>clearwing</b> <b>moth</b> species was reared from the host plant in Venezuela. The adult moth, including the male and female genitalia, larva, and pupa are described and illustrated. Its biology and possible use as a control agent are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{island was}} {{industrial}} from the seventeenth century, with watercourses for local mills, {{and was later}} {{the site of a}} pleasure garden. A fish pond still survives. Other habitats are woodland, meadows and river. Trees include a black poplar, and there are birds such as the woodpecker, kingfisher and grebe. There is a variety of butterflies including the speckled wood and holly blue, and the rare hornet <b>clearwing</b> <b>moth.</b> The ponds are an important habitat which have a variety of wetland plants.|$|R
5|$|Aposematism {{has also}} led to the {{development}} of mimicry complexes of Batesian mimicry, where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and Müllerian mimicry, where inedible species, often of related taxa, have evolved to resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as <b>clearwing</b> <b>moths)</b> have a general appearance that is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry.|$|R
40|$|NYS IPM Type: Fruits IPM Fact Sheet; NYS IPM Type: Ornamentals Fact SheetThe dogwood borer (DWB), {{a native}} <b>clearwing</b> <b>moth,</b> {{can be found}} from southeastern Canada to Florida, and as far west as the Mississippi. The insect has a wide host range {{including}} dogwood, pecan, oak, plum, and apple. The DWB has one generation per year throughout its geographic distribution. On apple DWB larvae feed primarily in burrknot tissue on clonal rootstocks. Burrknots are aggregations of root initials which can develop on the above ground portion of the rootstock (Fig. 1). All commercial dwarfing and semi-dwarfing rootstocks {{have a tendency to}} develop burrknots...|$|R
50|$|Hemaris is a genus of sphinx moths in the {{subfamily}} Macroglossinae, {{which is}} native to the Holarctic. Their main host plants are herbs and shrubs of the teasel and honeysuckle families. Moths in genus Hemaris are known collectively as <b>clearwing</b> <b>moths</b> or hummingbird moths in the US and bee hawk-moths in Britain. The related Old World hummingbird moths, genus Macroglossum, are similar in appearance and habits. Both genera have tails that are provided with an expansile truncated tuft of hairs, but only Hemaris has the disc of the wings transparent, as these scales are dropped soon after eclosion.|$|R
