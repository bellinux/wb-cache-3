25|$|In 1942 Glenn T. Seaborg invited Brown to {{work with}} him at the University of Chicago in the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory, working on ways to {{separate}} plutonium from uranium. The Manhattan Project intended to create plutonium by irradiating uranium in a nuclear reactor. The resulting highly <b>radioactive</b> <b>product</b> would then have to be chemically separated from the uranium and any fission products created by the irradiation process. The problem was that plutonium was a new element with chemical properties that were not yet fully known. Until a reactor could be built, it was available only in microgram amount, so an industrial separation process would have to be scaled up one billion times. With Orville Hill, Brown devised a successful method of achieving this by using the gaseous evaporation of fluorides.|$|E

40|$|A {{simplified}} radioenzymatic assay for chloramphenicol {{was developed}} by {{eliminating the need for}} cumbersome extraction procedures. After the acetylation of chloramphenicol with [14 C]acetyl coenzyme A in the presence of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, the reaction mixture was added to a toluene-based scintillation fluid.

The rapidity of this assay, as well as its accuracy, precision, and specificity, makes it particularly suitable for clinical use.

40|$|This study {{took place}} within the {{framework}} of a general update of the average radiation dose for the Dutch population. It focuses on consumer products in which radionuclides have been intentionally incorporated and on radiation-emitting devices that can be supplied to members of the public without special surveillance. Eleven consumer products were studied in more detail. The radiation from these products determined 90 % of the total collective dose due to consumer products in the Netherlands in 1988. Individual and collective doses are presented here for each product. The total collective dose has decreased from 130 personSv in 1988 to 4. 6 personSv at present. This reduction was attributed to: a {{decrease in the number of}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>products</b> (gas mantles), lower estimates of the number of <b>radioactive</b> <b>products</b> present in the Netherlands thanks to new information (camera lenses, smoke detectors containing Ra- 226), replacement of <b>radioactive</b> by non-radioactive <b>products</b> (gas mantles, dental protheses), and a lower estimate of the dose rate for certain products (smoke detectors, VDT). Some products were shown to be unavailable on the Dutch consumer market because importing and selling them was prohibited (antistatic brushes) or because the products were only available for professional users (TIG welding electrodes). Only a few products showed a significant change in radionuclide content. In summary, 60 - 70 % of the reduction is due to a realistic decrease in the number of <b>radioactive</b> <b>products.</b> The remaining 30 - 40 % is due to a better estimation of the number of products and the dose rate. The largest reduction of the total collective dose was realised through the decrease in the number of radioactive gas mantles. The contribution of gas mantles to the collective dose has decreased from 70 personSv in 1988 to 2 personSv per year at present. The total number of gas mantles has decreased by a factor of three of which still 1 / 10 th is radioactive. A further reduction in the contribution of consumer products is to be expected as a number of <b>radioactive</b> <b>products</b> will be placed on a list of non-justified applications as a result of the new Dutch Radiation Protection Act...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of functional mRNA coding for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) from Rhodosporidium toruloides was investigated. Polyadenylic acid [poly(A) ]-containing RNA was an efficient template for {{in vitro translation}} in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Non-poly(A) -containing RNA did not stimulate in vitro protein synthesis. Several lines of experimental evidence indicate that mRNA from R. toruloides directs PAL synthesis in reticulocyte lysate: (i) the major <b>radioactive</b> <b>product</b> in immunoprecipitates when lysates, incubated with yeast poly(A) -containing RNA, were reacted with PAL-antiserum had the same molecular weight as native PAL (75, 000); (ii) this major <b>radioactive</b> <b>product</b> competes with authentic PAL for binding to PAL-antiserum; and (iii) partial proteolytic peptide maps of the in vitro translation product were {{very similar to those}} of native PAL. The levels of functional mRNA coding for PAL, when R. toruloides was grown in different physiological conditions, were determined by quantitation of PAL synthesized in vitro when RNA was added to reticulocyte lysate. Functional PAL mRNA was six times higher in yeast grown on phenylalanine compared with glucose-phenylalanine minimal medium. No functional PAL mRNA was detected in yeast grown on glucose-ammonia minimal medium in {{the presence or absence of}} phenylalanine. These observed changes in functional PAL mRNA were similar to levels of PAL catalytic and antigenic activity. The kinetics of functional PAL mRNA synthesis and degradation were studied. Maximum levels of functional PAL mRNA were observed within 60 min of transfer to PAL-inducing growth conditions. Poly(A) -containing RNA and functional PAL mRNA were rapidly degraded when cells were transferred from phenylalanine to glucose-ammonia minimal medium, with half-lives of 25 and 10 min, respectively. Thus, it is suggested that the alterations in the amount of PAL in cells of R. toruloides grown in different physiological conditions primarily result from alteration in the amount of functional mRNA coding for the enzyme...|$|E
