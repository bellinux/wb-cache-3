25|$|Feeding {{more than}} six billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth’s resources. This begins with the {{appropriation}} of about 38% of the Earth’s land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity.

But the list of environmental costs of food production is a long one: topsoil depletion, erosion and conversion to desert from constant tillage of annual crops; overgrazing; salinization; sodification; waterlogging; high levels of fossil fuel use; reliance on inorganic fertilisers and synthetic organic pesticides; reductions in genetic diversity by the mass use of monocultures; water resource depletion; pollution of waterbodies by run-off and groundwater contamination; social problems including the decline of family farms and weakening of rural communities.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{competition among}} supermarkets in Brazil. In contrast to {{part of the}} economic literature {{which suggests that the}} fast growth of big supermarket chains would destroy independent, medium and small supermarkets, the paper argues that big supermarket chains can coexist with different formats of independent <b>food</b> <b>retailing.</b> As a result, competition in <b>food</b> <b>retail</b> is complex and cannot be described as a simple Darwinian process of market concentration. The analysis is divided in two parts. In the first part, the competition between hypermarkets and supermarkets is examined. Evidences for the district of Sao Paulo, Brazil, suggest that these retailers form separate markets. The second part is focused on neighborhood supermarkets. The results differ from the general belief that independent supermarkets establish higher prices in comparison to big chain supermarkets.
