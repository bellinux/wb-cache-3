The record company asked the band for some concept ideas for the cover art work, so the guys asked a friend and local artist Arthur Ball if he {{could come up with}} anything. He then {{produced}} the first Burn this Town cover art work as it is now, but only as a <b>rough</b> <b>proof</b> drawing, and stated that, if it were approved by the record company, he would redraw the whole thing again to a much higher standard. However, when Roadrunner received the proof art work for approval, they went ahead and pressed 2000 units for aworldwide release without the band's consent. The original Burn this Town cover art work {{is one of the most}} talked-about album covers in heavy metal history.The graphic looked amateurish, and the band worried what it might do to their reputation. However, the music did the talking and the album sold well. The band began developing a reputation in the region as a solid heavy metal outfit.|$|E

40|$|In the {{stochastic}} {{network model}} of Britton and Lindholm [Dynamic random networks in dynamic populations. Journal of Statistical Physics, 2010], {{the number of}} individuals evolves according to a linear birth and death process with per-capita birth rate λ and per-capita death rate μ<λ. A random social index is assigned to each individual at birth, which controls the rate at which connections to other individuals are created. Britton and Lindholm give a somewhat <b>rough</b> <b>proof</b> for the convergence of the degree distribution in this model towards a mixed Poisson distribution. We derive a rate for this convergence giving precise arguments. In order to do so, we deduce the degree distribution at finite time and and derive an approximation result for mixed Poisson distributions to compute an upper bound for the total variation distance to the asymptotic degree distribution. We prove several general results about linear birth and death processes along the way. Most notably, we derive the age distribution of an individual picked uniformly at random at some finite time.

In addition, we elaborate on the various notions of kernel operators in this context, show the stronger result that the adjoint semigroup converges strongly and discuss as an example diffusion equations on <b>rough</b> domains.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the direct and inverse problem of scattering of time-harmonic waves by an unbounded rough interface with a buried impenetrable obstacle. We first study the well-posedness of the direct problem with a local source by the variational method; the well-posedness result is then extended to scattering problems induced by point source waves (PSWs) and hyper-singular point source waves (HSPSWs). For PSW or HSPSW incident waves, the induced total field admits a uniformly bounded estimate in any compact subset far from the source position. Moreover, we show that the scattered field due to HSPSWs can be approximated by the scattered fields due to PSWs. With these properties and a novel reciprocity relation of the total field, we prove that the rough surface and the buried obstacle can be uniquely determined by the scattered near-field data measured only on a line segment above the <b>rough</b> surface. The <b>proof</b> substantially relies upon constructing a well-posed interior transmission problem for the Helmholtz equation. Comment: 2 figure...|$|R

If you don't cotton to the idea, kindly set it up at my expense, and let me know your terms for publishing. The great affair to me is to have per return (if it might be) four or five--better say half a dozen--sets of the <b>roughest</b> <b>proofs</b> that can be drawn. There are a good many men here whom I want to read the blessed thing, and not one would have the energy to read MS.

I become heavy and owlish; years sit upon me; it begins to seem {{to me to be a}} man's business to leave off his damnable faces and say his say. Else I could have made it pungent and light and lively. In considering, kindly forget that I am R. L.

I have to publish anyway, you understand; I have a purpose beyond; I am concerned for some of the parties to this quarrel. What I want to hear is from curiosity; what I want you to judge of is what we are to do with the book in a business sense.
