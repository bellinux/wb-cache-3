5|$|V-Series: {{introduced}} in October 2006, the Commodore V featured air conditioning, a sports-oriented body kit including 17-inch alloy wheels, a <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler</b> and colour-matched wing mirrors and exterior door handles.|$|E
5|$|Lumina: {{debuted in}} June 2007 with a luxury theme {{including}} the Berlina grille {{and the original}} Calais V seven-spoke alloy wheels. Specified identically to the V-Series with exception to the <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler,</b> the Lumina saw the addition of rear parking sensors and Bluetooth connectivity.|$|E
5|$|For the 2013 {{model year}} revision, Aston made minor {{changes to the}} {{bodywork}} by adapting designs from the Virage, including enlarging the recessed headlight clusters with bi-xenon lights and LED daytime strips, widening the front splitter, updating the grille and side heat extractors, updating the LED rear lights with clear lenses and integrating a new <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler</b> with the boot lid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rear</b> <b>spoilers</b> {{cannot be}} longer than 13 in, {{measured}} from the body-line-to-spoiler transition {{point to the}} tip.|$|R
5000|$|Body kit with {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>spoilers,</b> lower door trim {{moulding}} and side-skirts colour-matched {{to the rest}} of the body, 10 mm reduction in ride height ...|$|R
25|$|Skyline Aero Package Concept is {{a version}} of Skyline Sedan 350GT Type SP with dynamic front and <b>rear</b> <b>spoilers,</b> re-designed sporty front grill and chromed alloy wheels.|$|R
5|$|For certain markets like China, where Camry sits {{right below}} similar-sized Mercedes-Benz cars as a luxury model, it is {{important}} for the Aurion to exemplify the traits of such vehicles. With the development of the Aurion, designers produced two separate philosophies, each pitched at a specific niche of the market. The base model AT-X, and luxury Prodigy and Presara variants employ the comfort design, with the more aggressive sports-oriented style found on the Sportivo versions. To meet this requirement, the Sportivo variants feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, a <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler,</b> body kit appendages, and a three-spoke steering wheel. The high-performance TRD models offer a similar sports-oriented design, but are distinguishable by the use of unique body parts. These include a redesigned Formula One-inspired front bumper, with integrated foglamps, a unique rear bumper with fixed tailpipes.|$|E
5|$|Audi's No. 8 car made a {{pit stop}} for tyres, fuel and a {{replacement}} <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler.</b> The safety car {{went into the}} pit lane after 24 minutes and racing resumed with Jarvis leading the field back up to speed. Lamy passed François Perrodo's No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari at Rivage corner {{to take over the}} LMGTE Am lead. Patrick Long in the No. 88 Abu Dhabi Proton Racing car overtook Perrodo at Les Comes to take over second position in the same category. Fässler closed the gap to Heidfeld in the No. 12 Rebellion Racing vehicle but was spun by Albuquerque's RGR Sport car after moving in front of the vehicle upon lapping it at La Source resulting in heavy damage to the No. 7 Audi car's front-end, littering debris on the track. This was partly because Fässler braked early for the corner due to slower cars. Baxi DC Racing's No. 35 Alpine and the Abu Dhabi's No. 88 Porsche made heavy contact causing the former to sustain a right-rear puncture, littering the track with debris on the Kemmel Straight, and stopping {{on the side of the}} track. Calado's engine failed which prevented him from clinching victory in LMGTE Pro and he went into his garage to retire. Derani locked his tyres at La Source, allowing Lapierre to close the gap, and the French driver overtook Derani around the outside while lapping Franchitti's Ford GT at Fagnes to move into the LMP2 lead.|$|E
25|$|R/T - 2001–2004- Added color-keyed {{exterior}} {{features and}} <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler</b> to ES.|$|E

5000|$|Addition of [...] "S" [...] model, {{shown at}} Frankfurt in September 1979. The 928 S was not {{available}} in North America until 1983. Front & <b>rear</b> <b>spoilers.</b> Larger brakes.|$|R
50|$|The goal of many {{spoilers}} used in {{passenger vehicles}} {{is to reduce}} drag and increase fuel efficiency. Passenger vehicles can be equipped with front and <b>rear</b> <b>spoilers.</b> Front spoilers, found beneath the bumper, are mainly used to decrease the amount of air going underneath the vehicle to reduce the drag coefficient and lift.|$|R
25|$|The base GS and GR models came {{without a}} <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler,</b> {{which was an}} OEM Option.|$|E
25|$|The {{front and}} rear {{diffusers}} and the <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler</b> were also reworked to increase downforce by 60%.|$|E
25|$|For the 2010 model year, the Shelby Mustang GT500 was {{redesigned}} {{along with}} the base Ford Mustang. As with the 2007–09 GT500, the 2010 included unique front and rear fascias, hood with functional vents and unique <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler.</b> The <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler</b> included a functional Gurney flap. Along with new exterior colors, customers {{had the option of}} extending the exterior stripes onto the seats. Production was limited to 2000 units.|$|E
50|$|North American model {{went on sale}} in {{the first}} quarter of 2012 in limited {{quantities}} (500 units in 2012), and includes T5 engine, Active dual Xenon headlights, <b>rear</b> <b>spoilers,</b> aluminium sport pedals.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally {{found in}} on-road cars, the 80's saw {{the use of}} large <b>rear</b> <b>spoilers</b> on cars such as the RC10 and Team Losi JRX-2 in 1988. At that point, buggies began {{to break away from}} realism ...|$|R
50|$|A Sundowner van {{was offered}} with {{standard}} equipment as in GL van but also including the 4.1-litre engine, four-speed manual floor shift transmission, slotted steel wheels, sports instrumentation, front and <b>rear</b> <b>spoilers,</b> driving lights and exterior striping.|$|R
25|$|A <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler</b> {{usually comes}} {{standard}} in most sports vehicles and resembles {{the shape of}} a raised wing {{in the rear of the}} vehicle. The main purpose of a <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler</b> in a vehicle's design is to counteract lift, thereby increasing stability at higher speeds. In order to achieve the lowest possible drag, air must flow around the streamlined body of the vehicle without coming into contact with any areas of possible turbulence. A <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler</b> design that stands off the rear deck lid will increase downforce, reducing lift at high speeds while incurring a drag penalty. Flat spoilers, possibly angled slightly downward may reduce turbulence and thereby reduce the coefficient of drag. Some cars now feature automatically adjustable rear spoilers, so at lower speed the effect on drag is reduced when the benefits of reduced lift are not required.|$|E
25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{package includes}} an active <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler,</b> tuning of the underbody, the intakes in the grille {{and the front}} fender vents and aero stabilizing fins.|$|E
25|$|SXT - 2002–2005- Added fifteen-inch (15") alloy wheels, A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD {{player and}} 6 speakers, <b>rear</b> <b>spoiler,</b> power front windows, keyless entry, and power door locks to SE.|$|E
