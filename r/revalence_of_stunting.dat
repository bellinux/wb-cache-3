40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the health}} indicators in the National Midterm Development Planning (RPJMN) 2010 - 2014.

This study aims to clarify who was most contributed to the increasing prevalence <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> and why it was happened. Method: Analysis of the trend <b>of</b> the <b>stunting</b> prevalence based on the Basic Health Research (Riskesdas???

50|$|Looking at {{absolute}} {{numbers of children}} under 5 affected by stunting, it is obvious why current efforts and reductions are insufficient. The absolute number <b>of</b> <b>stunted</b> children has increased in Africa from 50.4 to 58.5 million in the time 2000-2015. This is despite the reduction in percentage prevalence <b>of</b> <b>stunting,</b> and {{is due to the}} high rates of population growth. The data therefore indicate that the rate <b>of</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> in Africa {{has not been able to}} counterbalance the increased number of growing children that fall into the trap of malnutrition, due to population growth in the region. This is also true in Oceania, unlike Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean where substantial absolute reductions in the number <b>of</b> <b>stunted</b> children have been observed (for example, Asia reduced its number <b>of</b> <b>stunted</b> children from 133 million to 88 million between 2000 and 2015).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Prevalence <b>of</b> child <b>stunting</b> in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) {{is among}} the highest in the world. There is a need to {{systematically}} investigate how stunting operates at different levels of determination and identify major factors contributing to the development <b>of</b> <b>stunting.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this study was to look for key determinants <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> in the DRC. Methods This study used data from the DRC Demographic Health Survey 2013 – 14 which included anthropometric measurement for 9030 under 5  year children. Height-for-Age Z score was calculated and classified according to the WHO guideline. The association between stunting and bio-demographic characteristics was assessed using logistic regression. Results Prevalence <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> was much higher in boys than girls. There was a significant rural urban gap in the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> with rural areas having a larger proportion of children living with stunting than urban. Male children, older than 6  months, preceding birth interval less than 24  months, being from lower wealth quintiles had the highest odds <b>of</b> <b>stunting.</b> Several provinces had in particular high odds <b>of</b> <b>stunting.</b> Early initiation <b>of</b> breastfeeding, mother’s age more than 20  years at the time of delivery had lower odds <b>of</b> <b>stunting.</b> The taller the mother the less likely the child was to be stunted. Similarly, mother’s BMI, access to safe water, access to hygienic toilet, mother’s education were found negatively correlated with child stunting in the bivariate logistic regression, but they lost statistical significance in multivariate analysis together with numbers of children in the family and place of residence. Conclusions Child stunting is widespread in the DRC and increasing prevalence is worrisome. This study has identified modifiable factors determining high prevalence <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> in the DRC. Policy implementation should in particular target provinces with high prevalence <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> and address modifiable determinants such as reducing socioeconomic disparity.

The {{percentage of the population}} that is underweight is 4.1%, and 9.8% of the population is overweight. The physical effects <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> are permanent, as children are unlikely to regain the loss in height and corresponding weight. Stunting can also have adverse effects on cognitive development, school performance, adult productivity and income, and maternal reproductive outcome.

40|$|Understanding {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> and underlying factors operating at meso-scale is {{of paramount importance}} for intervention designing and implementations. Yet, {{little is known about the}} spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> and some discrepancies are documented on the relative importance of reported risk factors. Therefore, the present study aims at exploring the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> at meso- (district) scale, and evaluates the effect of spatial dependency on the identification of risk factors and their relative contribution to the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> and severe stunting in a rural area of Ethiopia. A community based cross sectional study was conducted to measure the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> and severe stunting among children aged 0 - 59 months. Additionally, we collected relevant information on anthropometric measures, dietary habits, parent and child-related demographic and socio-economic status. Latitude and longitude of surveyed households were also recorded. Local Anselin Moran's I was calculated to investigate the spatial variation <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> prevalence and identify potential local pockets (hotspots) of high prevalence. Finally, we employed a Bayesian geo-statistical model, which accounted for spatial dependency structure in the data, to identify potential risk factors for stunting in the study area. Overall, the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> and severe stunting in the district was 43. 7 % [95 %CI: 40. 9, 46. 4] and 21. 3 % [95 %CI: 19. 5, 23. 3] respectively. We identified statistically significant clusters of high prevalence <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> (hotspots) in the eastern part of the district and clusters of low prevalence (cold spots) in the western. We found out that the inclusion of spatial structure of the data into the Bayesian model has shown to improve the fit for stunting model. The Bayesian geo-statistical model indicated that the risk <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> increased as the child's age increased (OR 4. 74; 95 % Bayesian credible interval [BCI]: 3. 35 - 6. 58) and among boys (OR 1. 28; 95 %BCI; 1. 12 - 1. 45). However, maternal education and household food security were found to be protective against stunting and severe stunting. Stunting prevalence may vary across space at different scale. For this, it's important that nutrition studies and, more importantly, control interventions take into account this spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of nutritional deficits and their underlying associated factors. The findings of this study also indicated that interventions integrating household food insecurity in nutrition programs in the district might help to avert the burden <b>of</b> <b>stunting...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Stunting</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the main}} {{problems}} of malnutrition {{often found in}} under-five children. The impacts include a delay in child’s growth, low endurance, lack of intelligence and productivity. The direct factors that influence the incidence <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> are low birth weight (LBW) while the indirect factors are socioeconomic factors such as maternal education, low family income {{and a large number}} of family members. Objective: To analyze the relationship between LBW and the incidence <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> in children aged 6 - 24 months in Yogyakarta Municipality. Method: This was a case-control study. The subjects were children aged 6 - 24 months with a group <b>of</b> cases comprising <b>stunted</b> children based on the indicator of height/age with a cut-off < - 2 SD Z-score and the control group comprising normal children. The number of subjects for the study was 242 with the under-five children’s mothers as the research respondents. The sample selection used non-probability sampling with a consecutive sampling method. The data were analyzed by Chi-Square and multiple logistic regression. Results: The proportion of children 6 - 24 months who had low birth weight was 15. 7 %. There was a significant relationship between LBW and the incidence <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> in children aged 6 - 24 months (OR= 5. 60; 95 %CI: 2. 27 to 15. 70). There was a relationship between maternal height and the incidence <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> in children aged 6 - 24 months (OR= 2. 14; 95 %CI: 1. 08 to 4. 33). Socioeconomic factors (maternal education, family income and a number of family members) did not have a significant relationship with the incidence <b>of</b> <b>stunting.</b> Conclusion: LBW had a relationship with the incidence <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> in children aged 6 - 24 months in Yogyakarta Municipality...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{problems}} <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> are {{its high}} prevalence {{as well as}} the complexity of its risk factors. Identifying the modifiable prognostic factors at birth may reduce the shortterm as well as longterm effects <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> in later life. Objective To estimate the influence of prognostic factors detected at birth for stunting at 24 months of age and the occurence <b>of</b> reversal <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> at 24 months of age among children in a rural area of Indonesia. Methods Subjects (n= 343) were born to mothers participating in a randomized controlled, double-blind, community-based study of vitamin A and/or zinc supplementation during pregnancy and followed from June 1998 to October 2000. The children were followed prospectively from birth until 2 years of age with monthly measurements of length from birth to 12 months, and again at 18 and 24 months. Data on potential prognostic factors detected at birth, i. e., maternal, child, and household facilities, were collected by trained field workers at home visits. The incidence and risk ratio were calculated to assess the influence of the possible prognostic factors detected at birth on stunting at 24 months of age among these children. Results Boys who were born prematurely had significantly higher risk <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> at 24 months of age compared to girls born maturely. The incidences <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> at 24 months of age according to gender, and gestational age were 33. 9 % boys vs. 22. 5 % girls (RR 1. 80; 95 %CI 1. 06 to 3. 09), and 33. 3 % premature vs. 27. 6 % mature (RR 7. 11; 95 %CI 2. 07 to 24. 48), respectively.
