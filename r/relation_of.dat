5|$|In Quenya, {{there are}} many {{similarities}} in form between prepositions and adverbs since the grammatical case already determines the <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> verb and object. Many Quenya prepositions have adverb-like uses with no complement. In Common Eldarin, these prepositions were postpositions instead, and later became inflectional endings. Case markings combine primarily with nouns, whereas prepositions can combine with phrases of many different categories. This is why most prepositions in Quenya are used with a noun in the nominative case.|$|E

Some <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> family cohesion to adjustment were stronger for younger than for older children. The <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> child autonomy to adjustment depended on child sex and age.
