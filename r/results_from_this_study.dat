5|$|Presociality is when animals exhibit {{more than}} just sexual {{interactions}} {{with members of the}} same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labor, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young. Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; the <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually.|$|E
5|$|This later {{reform was}} presaged by a {{reform in the}} middle of the 1950s; the {{economic}} historian Jörg Roesler considers the NES in the 1960s as a continuation of this reform. The origin of the reform in the 1950s was a scientific study, commissioned by Rau's ministry in 1953, to assess the need for greater economic efficiency in the factories. The subsequent <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> promised enhanced economic efficiency by shifting more responsibility from the National Planning Commission to the enterprises themselves. Thenceforward, already in spring 1954, Rau advocated such a planning reform, while planning boss Bruno Leuschner quite consistently opposed it. In August 1954, Rau's ministry sent a concept for such a reform to Leuschner's State Planning Commission. Eventually this reform got under way, after Ulbricht, perhaps under the influence of his new personal economic adviser Wolfgang Berger, had approved such a policy at the end of 1954 too. Subsequently, the reform accelerated until 1956. It found however its early end in the generally aggravated political atmosphere in 1957. Unrests in other Eastern Bloc countries during the previous year 1956, in particular in Hungary, had awoken the desire for more central control again. The subsequent unsatisfying economic development, however, during the following years eventually led in the 1960s to the concept of a new planning reform, the NES.|$|E

Fifty-five subjects were randomised to play either violent or non-violent video games. Subjects were later asked to read stories in which the characters' behaviour was ambiguous. Participants randomised to play violent video games were more likely to provide negative interpretations of the stories. Another study done by Anderson and Dill in 2000 found that violence in video games increases aggressive behavior in the short term although other scholars have suggested that <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> were not consistent, and that the methodology was flawed.|$|E

25|$|Expanded newborn {{screening}} is also opposed by among some health care providers, {{who are concerned}} that effective follow-up and treatment may not be available, that false positive screening tests may cause harm, and issues of informed consent. A recent study by Genetic Alliance and partners suggests that communication between health care providers and parents may be key in minimizing the potential harm when a false positive test occurs. The <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> also reveal that parents found {{newborn screening}} to be a beneficial and necessary tool to prevent treatable diseases.

25|$|More recent {{research}} has extended established findings of age related decline in executive functioning, by examining related cognitive processes that underlie healthy older adults’ sequential performance. Sequential performance refers to the execution of a series steps needed to complete a routine, such as the steps required to make {{a cup of coffee}} or drive a car. An important part of healthy aging involves older adults’ use of memory and inhibitory processes to carry out daily activities in a fixed order without forgetting the sequence of steps that were just completed while remembering {{the next step in the}} sequence. A recent study examined how young and older adults differ in the underlying representation of a sequence of tasks and their efficiency at retrieving the information needed to complete their routine. Findings from this study revealed that when older and young adults had to remember a sequence of 8 animal images arranged in a fixed order, both age groups spontaneously used the organizational strategy of chunking to facilitate retrieval of information. However, older adults were slower at accessing each chunk compared to younger adults, and were better able to benefit from the use of memory aids, such as verbal rehearsal to remember the order of the fixed sequence. <b>Results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> suggest that there are age differences in memory and inhibitory processes that affect people’s sequence of actions and the use of memory aids could facilitate the retrieval of information in older age.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} success of the {{privatization}} reform in China by evaluating the changes in performance of the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) after the Split-Share Structure reform in 2005, considering the changes in ownership structure. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> investigates how the ongoing privatization process in China is affecting the performance of SOEs. Existing studies made in other economies confirm that private ownership has a positive impact on the performance of the SOEs in contrast to state ownership. The Split-Share Structure reform is the large event by the Chinese government in order to reach the establishment of a modern corporate system. The methodology utilized consists of a Random Effects panel analysis. The data covers annual data for 1135 firms listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange over a six-year period, ranging from 2003 to 2008. The <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> shows that the state ownership ratio of Chinese SOEs have been decreasing after the reform was introduced in 2005. Further, the result implies significant improvements in performance of the SOEs after the reform. The <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> also shows that private ownership is superior to state ownership in consideration to improvements in performance, since an increase in the state ownership ratio would lead to a decrease in the market value of the firm...|$|R
