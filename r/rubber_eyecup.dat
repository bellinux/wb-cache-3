It weighs 0.8 kg, offers 4× magnification with a field of view of 8° and 35 mm eye relief. The 1P29 is issued with a canvas pouch, a lens cleaning cloth, combination tool, two <b>rubber</b> <b>eyecups,</b> two eyecup clamps and three different bullet drop compensation (BDC) cams for the AK-74, RPK-74 and PK machine gun. The 1P29 is intended for quickly engaging point and area targets at various ranges and is zeroed for both windage and elevation at 400 m. On {{the right side of the}} field of view a stadiametric rangefinder is incorporated that can be used to determine the distance from a 1.5 m tall object from 400 to 1200 m. The reticle is an inverted aiming post in the top half of the field of view and is tritium-illuminated for low-light condition aiming.|$|R
