The Swedish Transport <b>Administration</b> <b>registered</b> about 1, 300, 000 road vehicle-delay-hours due to unplanned stops over 5  minutes (and at least for all lanes in one direction) in 2010. The number of truck-delay hours is about 200, 000 (assuming that 15  % of the vehicles are trucks) and the number of the tonne-delay hours is approximately two million (assuming a load of ten tonnes per truck). The delays for the sea and air transports are probably negligible. Inland waterway transports do not exist in Sweden.

40|$|International audienceThe {{assessment}} of nominal effort {{is a key}} issue for the estimation of total catches. However, in many datacollection systems, total effort is inferred from sampling schemes at landing points or calculated from fishing forms or logbooks, which do not provide accurate information on a vessel's fishing activity. This problem is especially significant in small-scale fleets where fishers' behaviour and related fishing activity are heterogeneous. As fuel consumption by fishers is often subject to tax relief, it is <b>registered</b> by <b>administration</b> {{and can be used}} to improve and cross-check nominal effort measures (hours at sea, days at sea). This paper presents a methodology developed, using this type of dataset, for French West Indies fisheries. The protocol implemented was in three steps and used different data sources. First, a statistical analysis of engine power, engine type, and fuel consumption per métier was carried out based on field studies and fleet register information. Second, an algorithm was developed in order to estimate the number of trips and engine hours per vessel from vessel fuel consumption and vessel tank fill-ups, <b>registered</b> by the <b>administration.</b> Third, these estimates were used to provide a first {{assessment of}} the fleet landings per species and discuss the use of this information for calculation of revenue and running cost per trip, including fuel costs.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of an A-normal form {{intermediate}} language we formally specify resource allocation in a compiler for a strict functional language. Here, resource is to be understood in the most general sense: registers, temporaries, data representations, etc. All these should be (and can be, but have never been) specified formally. Our approach employs a non-standard annotated type system for the formalization. Although A-normal form turns out not to be the ideal vehicle for this investigation, we can prove some basic properties using the formalization. 1 Resource Allocation Resource allocation in the back end of a compiler is often poorly specified. More often than not <b>register</b> allocation, <b>administration</b> of temporaries, and representation conversions are only specified procedurally [1, 6].
