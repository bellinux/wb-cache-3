We present, to the authors' knowledge, the first experimental field test to demonstrate that females trade mating status against territory quality as proposed by this hypothesis. Previous work has shown that female red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) in Ontario prefer settling with unmated males and that this preference is adaptive because polygynous mating status lowers female reproductive success. Other evidence suggests that nesting over water increases the reproductive success of female red-winged blackbirds. Here we describe an experiment in which females were given choices between two adjacent territories, one owned by an unmated male without any over-water nesting sites and the other by an already-mated male with over-water sites. Females overwhelmingly preferred the already-mated males, demonstrating that superior territory quality can <b>reverse</b> <b>preferences</b> based on mating status and supporting the polygyny threshold model as the explanation for polygyny in this population...|$|E

However, those tests were criticized because they had characteristics that might ``trigger'' use of other heuristics. This paper presents new tests that avoid those characteristics. Expected values of the gambles are nearly equal in each choice. In addition, if a person followed expected value (EV), expected utility (EU), CPT, or PH in these tests, she would shift her preferences {{in the same direction}} as shifts in EV or EU. In contrast, the transfer of attention exchange model (TAX) and a similarity model predict that people will <b>reverse</b> <b>preferences</b> in the opposite direction. Results contradict the PH, even when PH is modified to include a preliminary similarity evaluation using the PH parameters. New tests of probability-consequence interaction were also conducted.

40|$|Amartya Sen {{argues that}} it is not, after all, irrational to <b>reverse</b> <b>preferences</b> when your choices are amplified by an ‘irrelevant’ alternative. He offers {{examples}} such as the agent who always picks the next-to-largest piece of cake. Given a choice between a larger and smaller piece, I will prefer the smaller one. But when a third and largest piece in added to my alternatives, I will now prefer the formerly largest piece over the smallest piece. This violates ‘contraction consistency’: a third alternative should not have made any difference in my preferences regarding the first two. Such examples are shown to rely on descriptions which omit features crucial to choice. These features, and all identifying features relevant to my decision, {{should be included in}} the descriptions of the alternatives. An adequate description does not smuggle norms into the overt act of choice, but it does include the non-normative characteristics without which my decision-rules, if any, cannot be applied. When alternatives are adequately described, Sen’s inconsistencies disappear. The result is a clearer and more resillent, but also less aggressive notion of behavioral consistency.

40|$|AGOA is a US {{trade policy}} which defines and underpins {{the trade and}} {{investment}} relations between the US and sub-Saharan Africa. Essentially, AGOA extends duty free treatment to exports from eligible sub Saharan African countries. These preferences are aimed at promoting sub-Saharan African export earnings and stimulating their economic growth by giving them improved access to the US market. South Africa is one the few sub-Saharan African countries with a high utilization rate of the AGOA preferences, and has substantially benefited from AGOA. However, {{in order to ensure}} compliance with the eligibility requirements, an eligible sub-Saharan African country is subjected to constant, on-going surveillance and monitoring through the out of cycle review mechanism. Importantly, the US President has the prerogative to determine whether a sub- Saharan African country is eligible or remains eligible for the AGOA preferential treatment. The strict eligibility requirements and out of cycle review mechanism as well as the unilateral nature of AGOA deprive it of the necessary stability, certainty and predictability. Importantly, the out of cycle review mechanism has a chilling effect on trade policies of eligible sub-Saharan African countries. This is particularly true in respect of South Africa, whose trade policy is the primary subject of the study. Notwithstanding the economic benefits, the disadvantages and or risks associated with AGOA overwhelm same. The disadvantages and or risks are amply demonstrated by the recent development in which South Africa was compelled to remove Anti-Dumping duties and Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary measures it had validly imposed on US poultry in return for retaining AGOA preferences. Consequently, it is contended that AGOA is not a non-reciprocal preferential scheme that it purports to be. Instead, it is de facto reciprocal or has <b>reverse</b> <b>preferences</b> embedded in it. This study therefore argues that South Africa is entitled to impose Anti-Dumping duties and the Sanitary and Phyo-Sanitary measures, provided that specific requirements are met and that the measures imposed by South Africa on US poultry are legal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 and the WTO law as long as the procedural and substantive requirements have been fulfilled. Consequently, the consistency thereof can only be tested using the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. Further, the study highlights the implications of removing the above-mentioned measures for South Africa's trade policy and explores various alternative trade arrangements which South Africa and other sub-Saharan African countries may pursue in order to ensure or secure a stable, transparent, reciprocal trade relation with the US. tm 2017 Centre for Human RightsLLMUnrestricte...|$|E

Presude Europskoga suda u radu se prikazuju opsežno, jer ukazuju na temeljni pristup odnosno način na koji bi domaći sudovi trebali primjenjivati hrvatski Zakon o suzbijanju diskriminacije koji je stupio na snagu 1. siječnja 2009. godine. Equality is {{a comparative}} concept: {{an individual can}} ascertain whether they have ‘equality’ only by comparing their conditions with the conditions of others. There are two broad conceptual approaches to equality. Formal or ‘juridical’ equality refers to a basic idea: that individuals in like situations should be treated alike. Formal equality focuses on equal treatment based on the appearance of similarity regardless of the broader context. Laws or practices that tend to grant different treatment to individuals in similar situations may result in direct discrimination. Structural factors can ensure that regardless of equal treatment or prohibition of direct discrimination, certain groups fall behind the rest of society. Therefore, applied on its own and if differences are not taken into account as well as similarities, consistency of treatment is inadequate to ensure the broader aims of equality. ‘Substantive equality’ refers {{to the notion that}} individuals in different situations should be treated differently. It encompasses two distinct ideas – equality of results and equality of opportunity. Under international discrimination law, a State may also be required (or permitted) to take measures to ensure the ‘ factual equality’ or substantive equality of protected groups. Positive action or affirmative measures (also known as ‘special measures’) are proactive measures taken by a government or private institution to remedy the effects of past and present discrimination by providing <b>reverse</b> <b>preferences</b> favouring members of classes previously disadvantaged. Such preferential treatment runs counter to the strictly formal notion of equality. Many international instruments explicitly permit positive action without imposing an obligation on States to take such measures. There are also a number of types of conduct that are prohibited by international discrimination law. Direct discrimination is based on the idea of formal equality. It may be defined as less favourable or detrimental treatment of an individual or group of individuals {{on the basis of a}} prohibited characteristic or ground such as race, sex, or disability. Indirect discrimination occurs when a practice, rule, requirement or condition is neutral on its face but impacts disproportionately upon particular groups, unless that practice, rule, requirement or condition is justified. Prohibitions of indirect discrimination require a State to take account of relevant differences between groups. Article 14 is the central provision of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter: Convention) concerning equality ("The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status. "). It has been interpreted as an open-ended prohibition of discrimination because of the use of the words "other status". The European Court of Human Rights (hereinafter: the Court) in its case-law reiterates that Article 14 of the Convention has no independent existence, since it has effect solely in relation to the rights and freedoms safeguarded by the other substantive provisions of the Convention and its Protocols. Therefore, Article 14 provides an ‘accessory right’ to equality in the enjoyment of the substantive rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention. However, the application of Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention. It is necessary but it is also sufficient for the facts of the case to fall "within the ambit" of one or more of the provisions in question. The prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and Protocols require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Article of the Convention, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide. According to the Court 2 ̆ 7 s settled case-law, discrimination means treating persons in similar situations differently without an objective and reasonable justification. "No objective and reasonable justification" means that the distinction in issue does not pursue a "legitimate aim" or that there is not a "reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised". The Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment. The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background. Thus, Article 14 does not prohibit a member State from treating groups differently in order to correct "factual inequalities" between them; indeed, in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may, without an objective and reasonable justification, give rise to a breach of that Article. Similarly, a wide margin of appreciation is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature 2 ̆ 7 s policy choice unless it is "manifestly without reasonable foundation". In more general terms, the Court has held that the provisions of the Convention do not prevent Contracting States from introducing general policy schemes by way of legislative measures whereby a certain category or group of individuals is treated differently from others, provided that the interference with the rights of the statutory category or group as a whole can be justified under the Convention. Lastly, as to the burden of proof in relation to Article 14 of the Convention, the Court has held that once the applicant has shown a difference in treatment, it is for the Government to show that it was justified. The above legal opinions of the Court concerning prohibition of discrimination indicate the basic approach that the domestic courts should take in applying the Croatian Anti-Discrimination Act which entered into force on 1 January 2009. Gleichheit ist ein komparatives Konzept. Sie offenbart und bestimmt sich durch den Vergleich. Ob „Gleichheit“ besteht, lässt sich nur ermitteln, wenn man die Lage des einen und des anderen in analogen Situationen vergleicht. Bei der Gleichheit gibt es zwei allgemeine konzeptionelle Ansätze. Die formelle oder „juridische“ Gleichheit drückt den Grundgedanken aus, dass die Einzelnen in gleichen Situationen gleich behandelt werden müssen. Die formelle Gleichheit ist auf die Gleichbehandlung aufgrund äußerer Ähnlichkeit unabhängig vom weiteren Zusammenhang ausgerichtet. Gesetze oder Praktiken, die eine unterschiedliche Behandlung der Einzelnen in vergleichbaren Situationen anstreben, können in unmittelbarer Diskriminierung resultieren. Strukturelle Faktoren können dazu führen, dass trotz Gleichbehandlung oder des Verbots unmittelbarer Diskriminierung bestimmte Gruppen im Vergleich zur restlichen Gesellschaft benachteiligt werden. Demnach ist ein konsequentes Verfahren ohne Beachtung von Unterschieden beziehungsweise Ähnlichkeiten für die Sicherung von weiteren Gleichheitszielen unzulänglich. Die substanzielle Gleichheit erfordert, dass in unterschiedlichen Situationen die Einzelnen auch unterschiedlich behandelt werden. Diese Gleichheit umfasst zwei distinkte Ideen, die Gleichheit der Ergebnisse und die der Möglichkeiten. Das Völkerrecht, das sich mit dem Diskriminierungsschutz befasst, kann einem Staat auferlegen (oder erlauben), zur Sicherung der „realen Gleichheit“ oder substanziellen Gleichheit der geschützten Gruppen bestimmte Maßnahmen zu ergreifen. Positive Aktionen oder Förderungsaktionen (ebenfalls bekannt als „spezifische Maßnahmen“) sind proaktive Maßnahmen, die vom Staat oder einer privaten Einrichtung unternommen werden, um die Folgen einer früheren oder gegenwärtigen Diskriminierung zu korrigieren, indem durch die umgekehrte, bevorzugte Behandlung die Angehörigen der zuvor benachteiligten Gruppe besser gestellt werden. Eine solche Bevorzugung steht im Gegensatz zum streng formellen Begriff der Gleichheit. Viele völkerrechtliche Instrumente erlauben die positive Aktion ausdrücklich, verpflichten die Staaten jedoch nicht, sie zu unternehmen. Es gibt auch Verhaltensweisen, die durch den völkerrechtlichen Diskriminierungsschutz verboten sind. Unmittelbare Diskriminierung gründet auf der Idee der formellen Gleichheit. Sie kann als verbotene benachteiligende oder schädigende Behandlung des Einzelnen oder einer Gruppe Einzelner aufgrund von Merkmalen oder Grundlagen wie Rasse, Geschlecht oder Behinderung definiert werden. Um mittelbare Diskriminierung handelt es sich, wenn die Praxis, Vorschrift, Forderung oder Bedingung scheinbar neutral ist, auf bestimmte Gruppen jedoch unverhältnismäßig ungünstig einwirkt, es sei denn, diese Praxis, Vorschrift, Forderung oder Bedingung ist gerechtfertigt. Das Verbot der mittelbaren Diskriminierung erfordert vom Staat, relevante Unterschiede zwischen Gruppen zu berücksichtigen. Die zentrale Vorschrift zur Gleichheit ist in Artikel 14 der Konvention zum Schutze der Menschenrechte und Grundfreiheiten (im Folgenden als „Konvention“ bezeichnet) zu finden: "Der Genuss der in dieser Konvention anerkannten Rechte und Freiheiten ist ohne Diskriminierung insbesondere wegen des Geschlechts, der Rasse, der Hautfarbe, der Sprache, der Religion, der politischen oder sonstigen Anschauung, der nationalen oder sozialen Herkunft, der Zugehörigkeit zu einer nationalen Minderheit, des Vermögens, der Geburt oder eines sonstigen Status zu gewährleisten. ". Die Worte „eines sonstigen Status“ zeigen, dass dieses Diskriminierungsverbot auf eine offene Liste anzuwenden ist. Der Europäische Gerichtshof für Menschenrechte (im folgenden als „Gerichtshof“ bezeichnet) wiederholt in seinen Entscheidungen immer wieder, dass Artikel 14 der Konvention keine eigenständige Existenz hat, da er nur in Bezug auf die durch andere substanzielle Bestimmungen der Konvention und des Protokolls gewährten Rechte und Freiheiten eine Wirkung entfaltet. Somit sieht Artikel 14 ein „akzessorisches Recht“ auf Gleichheit beim Genuss der durch die Konvention gewährleisteten substanziellen Rechte und Freiheiten vor. Dennoch bedeutet die Anwendung von Artikel 14 nicht zwingend die Verletzung eines durch die Konvention gewährleisteten substanziellen Rechtes. Es ist erforderlich, zugleich aber auch ausreichend, dass der Sachverhalt des jeweiligen Falles in den Rahmen einer oder mehrerer Bestimmungen der Konvention fallen. Das Diskriminierungsverbot aus Artikel 14 erstreckt sich daher über den Genuss der Rechte und Freiheiten, die nach Konvention und Protokoll jeder Staat zu sichern hat, hinaus. Sie kommen auch bei jenen erweiterten Rechten zur Anwendung, die zum allgemeinen Rahmen eines der Artikel der Konvention gehören und die der Staat freiwillig gewährleisten will. Im Einklang mit der herkömmlichen Rechtsprechung des Europäischen Gerichtshofes bedeutet Diskriminierung die unterschiedliche Behandlung einer Person in einer vergleichbaren Situation ohne eine entsprechende Rechtfertigung. Das „Fehlen einer sachlichen und angemessenen Rechtfertigung“ bedeutet, dass die betreffende Unterscheidung keinen „legitimen Zweck“ verfolgt oder dass es „keine angemessene Verhältnismäßigkeit zwischen den angewandten Mitteln und dem angestrebten Zweck gibt“. Den Vertragsstaaten bleibt ein gewisser Ermessensspielraum überlassen bei der Beurteilung, ob und in welchem Maße Unterscheidungen in vergleichbaren Situationen ein unterschiedliches Verfahren rechtfertigen. Die Größe dieses Spielraumes hängt von den konkreten Umständen, dem Sachverhalt und dem Zusammenhang des jeweiligen Falles ab. Demnach verbietet Artikel 14 den Mitgliedstaaten nicht, Gruppen unterschiedlich zu behandeln, wenn dadurch „sachliche Ungleichheiten“ zwischen ihnen berichtigt werden; vielmehr kann unter bestimmten Bedingungen der unterlassene Versuch, die Ungleichheit durch eine Ungleichbehandlung aus dem Weg zu räumen, auch zu einer Verletzung dieses Artikels führen, sofern hierfür keine sachliche und vernünftige Rechtfertigung vorliegt. Ähnlich wird den Vertragsstaaten aufgrund der Konvention ein breiter Ermessensspielraum gewährt, wenn es um die allgemeinen wirtschafts- oder sozialstrategischen Maßnahmen geht. Durch ihre unmittelbaren Einblicke in die gesellschaftliche Lage und ihre Bedürfnisse können die innerstaatlichen Behörden das öffentliche Interesse im sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Bereich in der Regel besser einschätzen als eine internationale Richterschaft, weshalb der Gerichtshof dem nationalen Gesetzgeber bei der Politikwahl grundsätzlich den Vorrang einräumt, sofern diese nicht „offensichtlich einer vernünftigen Grundlage entbehrt“. Im Allgemeinen bezieht der Gerichtshof den Standpunkt, dass die Bestimmungen der Konvention die Vertragsstaaten nicht daran hindern, durch gesetzgeberische Maßnahmen Schemata allgemeiner Politiken einzuführen, durch die Ungleichbehandlungen bestimmter Kategorien von Einzelnen oder ganzer Gruppen begründet werden, solange ein solcher Eingriff in die Rechte gesetzlich definierter Personen oder Gruppen durch die Konvention rechtfertigbar ist. Die Beweislast in Bezug auf Artikel 14 der Konvention im Sinne einer Rechtfertigung der Ungleichbehandlung schließlich ordnet der Gerichtshof dem beklagten Staat zu, wenn der Beschwerdeführer die unterschiedliche Behandlung nachgewiesen hat. Die hier ausgeführten rechtlichen Würdigungen des Gerichtshofes im Zusammenhang mit dem Diskriminierungsverbot zeigen den prinzipiellen Ansatz auf, den die nationalen Gerichte bei der Anwendung des kroatischen Gesetzes zur Bekämpfung der Diskriminierung, das am 1. Januar 2009 in Kraft getreten ist, haben sollten...|$|E

A model for binding protein-mediated recognition revealed two strategies for differential responses. The wild-type preference for ribose probably reflects a balance of receptor affinities and a limiting supply of binding proteins.

Preliminary results based on participation from forty 2 - to 3 -year-olds indicate a significant correlation between executive function skills and degree of preference for motionese versus the non-action analog.

40|$|The {{structure}} of trypsin from the fungus Fusarium oxysporum has been refined at 1. 55 Å resolution by restrained least-squares minimization to an R-factor of 14. 4 %. The data were recorded from a single-crystal on the X 31 beamline at EMBL, Hamburg, using a locally developed image-plate scanner. The final model consists of 1557 protein atoms, 400 water molecules, one molecule of isopropanol and one monoisopropyl phosphoryl inhibitor group covalently {{bound to the}} catalytic Ser 195. Comparison of the structure with bovine trypsin reveals {{significant differences in the}} active site and suggests a possible explanation for the difference in substrate specificity between the two enzymes. In F. oxysporum trypsin the specificity pocket is larger than in bovine trypsin. This explains the preference of F. oxysporum trypsin for the bulkier arginine over lysine and the <b>reverse</b> <b>preference</b> in bovine trypsin. The binding cavity on the C-terminal side of the substrate is more restricted in F. oxysporum trypsin than in mammalian and Streptomyces griseus trypsins, which explains the relative inactivity of F. oxysporum trypsin towards peptide-pNA substrate analogues as an unfavourable steric interaction between the side of the binding cavity and the para-nitroanilino group of peptide-pNA. The observed restriction of the binding cavity does not lead to a reduced catalytic activity compared to other trypsins...|$|R
40|$|Nonreinforced {{retrieval}} {{can cause}} extinction and/or reconsolidation, two processes that affect subsequent retrieval in opposite ways. Using the Morris water maze task we show that, in the rat, repeated nonreinforced expression of spatial memory causes extinction, which is unaffected by inhibition of protein synthesis within the CA 1 {{region of the}} dorsal hippocampus. However, {{if the number of}} nonreinforced retrieval trials is insufficient to induce long-lasting extinction, then a hippocampal protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation process recovers the original memory. Inhibition of hippocampal protein synthesis after reversal learning sessions impairs retention of the <b>reversed</b> <b>preference</b> and blocks persistence of the original one, suggesting that reversal learning involves reconsolidation rather than extinction of the original memory. Our results suggest the existence of a hippocampal protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation process that operates to recover or update retrieval-weakened memories from incomplete extinction. Consolidation is the protein synthesis-dependent process that stabilizes new memories and makes them resistant to pharmaco-logical and traumatic disruption (McGaugh 1966). Since the ob-servation that trained animals re-exposed to reminder cues along with hypothermia or electroconvulsive shock show diminished retrieval (Misanin et al. 1968; Lewis et al. 1972), several au-thors have suggested {{that at the time of}} retrieval consolidated memories become vulnerable again (Przybyslawski and Sara 1997; Przybyslawski et al. 1999). It was proposed that in order to endure after retrieval, memories must undergo a further round of protein synthesis-dependent stabilization called reconsolidatio...|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} tested {{whether the}} Implicit Association Test (IAT) {{is sensitive to}} the perceived accuracy of newly learned associations. In experiment 1, participants learned to associate positive or negative attributes with two novel groups. Participants in one condition {{were told that the}} attributes accurately described the groups; in a second condition, prior to learning, they were made aware that the attributes were randomly assigned to the groups. Participants were given an IAT and an explicit measure testing attitudes towards the two groups. When the participants were told that the attributes were accurate, their IAT performance and explicit measure responses indicated a preference for the more positively described group but when the attributes were known to be arbitrary, preferences were reduced according to both measures. Experiment 2 replicated these results and demonstrated that the associations were learned even in the random condition. Experiment 3 included a condition that placed “not ” before each attribute, which demonstrated that people can incorporate a negative modifier into a learned association. Explicit attitudes and the IAT showed <b>reversed</b> <b>preferences</b> in this negation condition. These experiments imply that the IAT is sensitive to the perceived accuracy of learned associations. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The study used hypothetical surveys to measure respondents' preferences, but in one survey version respondents expected and received a follow-up question involving real monetary payments. The results indicate that those respondents who received hypothetical surveys that included a real-money question registered a different preference function from those respondents who received a survey that asked respondents to answer hypothetical questions only. The study finds that respondents may <b>reverse</b> their <b>preferences</b> for parcel attributes, such as public access to the parcel as related to presentation. Financial Economics,...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{foraging}} theory {{predicts that}} predators prefer those prey {{species that are}} most rewarding in terms of reproductive success, which is dependent on prey quality and prey availability. To investigate which selection pressures may have moulded prey preference in an acarine system consisting of two prey species and three predator species, we tested whether prey preference of the predators is matched by the associated reproductive success. The predators involved areAmblyseius finlandicus (Oudemans),Am. potentillae (Garman) andTyphlodromus pyri Scheuten. The prey species are the apple rust mite (Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa)) and the {{fruit-tree red spider mite}} (Panonychus ulmi (Koch)). Reproductive success was assessed in terms of intrinsic rate of increase and for one predator also in terms of diapause induction. All three predator species reached highest reproductive success on the same prey species: apple rust mite. This was most pronounced for the predatorAm. finlandicus, because its larval stage suffered severe mortality when feeding onP. ulmi. An independent study on prey preference of the three predator species (Dicke et al., 1988) revealed thatAm. finlandicus prefersAc. schlechtendali toP. ulmi, whereas the other two predator species have the <b>reverse</b> <b>preference.</b> Thus, on the basis of current data, prey preference ofAm. finlandicus can be understood in terms of reproductive success. However, this is not so for prey preference ofT. pyri andAm. potentillae. Investigations needed for a better understanding of prey preference of the last-named two predator species are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Animals {{were tested}} for forelimb {{preference}} in a grasp or in a force task before microstimulation mapping {{of the primary}} motor cortex contralateral to the preferred forelimb. The size and location of the preferred forelimb primary motor cortex representation was determined and ablated. Seven days later, forelimb preference was again evaluated. Reversal of the initial preference after cortical ablation depended {{on the size of}} the preferred forelimb primary motor cortex representation. The mean size of the forelimb representation of the animals that immediately <b>reversed</b> forelimb <b>preference</b> after the cortical ablation was significantly smaller than the mean size of the representation of the animals that did not <b>reverse</b> forelimb <b>preference</b> in three consecutive tests seven days after the lesion. In another experiment, the size, location, and threshold currents of the forelimb representations were evaluated bilaterally before the forelimb preference test. The mean size of the preferred representations did not differ from the mean size of the non-preferred representations. However, when the primary motor cortex representation of the preferred forelimb was ablated, reversal of the initial preference depended, as in the previous experiment, {{on the size of the}} forelimb representation. In conclusion, reversal of forelimb preference after ablation of the preferred forelimb primary motor cortex representation depends on the size of the forelimb representation. Moreover, forelimb preference in a behavioral task is not associated with a larger forelimb representation in the contralateral primary motor cortex. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{prove that}} every Condorcet-consistent voting rule can be {{manipulated}} by a voter who completely <b>reverses</b> their <b>preference</b> ranking, assuming that {{there are at least}} 4 alternatives. This corrects an error and improves a result of [Sanver, M. R. and Zwicker, W. S. (2009). One-way monotonicity as a form of strategy-proofness.

We also show analogues of our result for irresolute voting rules. We then leverage our result to state a strong form of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem.

40|$|We {{show that}} in a standard, {{technology}} shock-driven one-sector real business cycle model, the stabilization effects of government fiscal policy depend crucially on how labor hours enter the household’s period utility function and the associated labor-market be-havior. In particular, when the household utility is logarithmic in both consumption and leisure, income taxes are destabilizing and government purchases are stabilizing. However, the results are <b>reversed</b> when <b>preferences</b> are instead convex in hours worked. That is, income taxes are now stabilizing and public spending is destabilizing. Furthermore, under both preference specifications, the magnitude of cyclical fluctuations in output remains unchanged when the income tax rate and the share of government purchases in GDP are equal (including laissez-faire) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{inconsistency}} of judgments in {{the fuzzy}} Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a cru-cial issue. To make the appropriate decision, the inconsistency in decision maker's (DM) judgments {{needs to be}} eliminated or reduced. This paper proposes two mathematical models to deal with inconsistency in Fuzzy AHP. In the first model, the DM's judgments are modified where the preference order of the DM's judgments remained unchanged. The second model allows <b>reversing</b> the <b>preference</b> orders of judgments. The proposed models aim to eliminate or reduce the inconsistency of fuzzy AHP by changing judg-ments. The models cause fewer changes for the high certain judgments. Two examples solved by the proposed models are included for purposes of illustration...|$|R
