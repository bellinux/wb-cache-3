5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail <b>rotor</b> <b>blade.</b> Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Further insufficiencies, such as <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> {{friction}} and drag, gearbox losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine. The basic relation that the turbine power is (approximately) {{proportional to the}} third power of velocity remains.|$|E
5|$|As the air {{ambulance}} prepares to land outside {{the emergency department}} a <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> is struck by a drone, causing the helicopter to crash land {{in the parking lot}} outside the hospital and into the back of an ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). The tail of the helicopter smashes into the entrance of the emergency department causing brutal injuries. The department is shut down following the incident, with Connie and Grace’s lives prioritised. Grace is freed from the helicopter and taken into the department for treatment. Connie learns Grace has life-threatening injuries and may not survive surgery. The staff at Holby City come together to treat casualties of the accident. Grace survives surgery, but remains in a critical condition.|$|E
50|$|Failure in {{ultimate}} {{loading of}} wind-turbine <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> exposed to wind and gravity loading {{is a failure}} mode {{that needs to be}} considered when the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> are designed. The wind speed that causes bending of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> exhibits a natural variability, and so does the stress response in the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades.</b> Also, the resistance of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades,</b> in terms of their tensile strengths, exhibits a natural variability.|$|R
50|$|In 1998 {{the company}} was {{employing}} Skywheels <b>rotor</b> <b>blades,</b> but changed to McCutchen. In about 2004 the company switched from using McCutchen <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> to using Dragon Wings <b>rotor</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{rotorcraft}} many components {{have recommended}} or mandatory TBOs, including main <b>rotor</b> <b>blades,</b> tail <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> and gearboxes.|$|R
25|$|The yellow main <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> {{separated}} in flight rendering the aircraft uncontrollable.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} {{difference between the}} entry and exit of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> is called reaction pressure. The change in pressure energy is calculated through degree of reaction.|$|E
25|$|As wind is free (no fuel cost), wind-to-rotor {{efficiency}} (including <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> {{friction and}} drag) {{is one of}} many aspects impacting the final price of wind power.|$|E
40|$|<b>Rotor</b> <b>blades</b> of {{wind energy}} {{converters}} are highly stressed components subject to constant load cycles. Regular inspections of <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> are indispensible for reliable operation and cost effective production without longer downtimes. Insurers and lenders demand routine inspection of <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> every two years. The {{wide range of}} damage that occurs on <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> greatly depends {{on the construction of}} the blades. Inspection must primarily detect damage caused by delamination, bonding defects, lightning strikes, air inclusions and cracks. Automated inspection of <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> with service robots is one of the Robotic Systems Business Unit's interesting fields of research. This paper presents the results of the joint project RIWEA. The Fraunhofer IFF developed a concept for a robot system that automatically inspects <b>rotor</b> <b>blades...</b>|$|R
50|$|The initial programme, BERP I, {{studied the}} design, {{manufacture}} and qualification of composite <b>rotor</b> <b>blades.</b> This resulted in producing new main rotor and tail <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> for the Westland Sea King. Following {{on from the}} first, the second programme, BERP II, analysed advanced aerofoil sections for future <b>rotor</b> <b>blades.</b> This fed into the BERP III programme.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{problems}} with any single set of <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> is the torque (rotational force) exerted on the helicopter fuselage in the direction opposite to the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades.</b> This torque causes the fuselage to rotate in the direction opposite to the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades.</b> In single <b>rotor</b> helicopters, the antitorque rotor or tail rotor counteracts the main rotor torque and controls the fuselage rotation.|$|R
25|$|TAM {{has also}} {{developed}} a concept for a backpack helicopter called Libellula, with a two-bladed rotor driven by a small rocket engine {{at the end of}} each <b>rotor</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|E
25|$|Whereas a {{helicopter}} works by forcing the rotor blades through the air, drawing air from above, the autogyro <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> generates lift {{in the same}} way as a glider's wing by changing the angle of the air as the air moves upwards and backwards relative to the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade.</b> The free-spinning blades turn by autorotation; the rotor blades are angled so that they not only give lift, but the angle of the blades causes the lift to accelerate the blades' rotation rate, until the rotor turns at a stable speed with the drag and thrust forces in balance.|$|E
25|$|The Skeeter {{possessed a}} {{relatively}} conventional configuration for a helicopter, being {{powered by a}} single piston engine which drove a 29-foot (8.84metre) three-bladed main rotor and a three-bladed anti-torque rotor, which was mounted {{at the end of}} a triangular-section tailboom. The main rotor-blades made used of a composite construction, utilising a steel-tube spar that was bonded to wooden veneers, formers, and ribs, as well as brass balance-weights; these reportedly delivered a cost-effective and relatively simplistic <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> that also possessed favourable fatigue properties. Saunders-Roe also developed a replacement metal light alloy <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> that possessed superior aerodynamic properties and provided increased performance. A fixed tricycle undercarriage arrangement, complete with interchangeable wheels and brake units, was also present.|$|E
50|$|The mast is a {{cylindrical}} {{metal shaft}} that extends upwards from the transmission. At {{the top of}} the mast is the attachment point for the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> called the hub. The <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> are attached to the hub. Main rotor systems are classified according to how the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> are attached and move relative to the hub. There are three basic types: hingeless, fully articulated, and teetering; although some modern rotor systems use a combination of these.|$|R
5|$|The engines power an 18.59metre {{diameter}} five-bladed main <b>rotor.</b> The <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> {{are constructed}} from carbon/glass with nomex honeycomb and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping {{of the main}} <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> {{is derived from the}} BERP <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the blade tip and reduces the acoustic signature. Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed, this increases the AW101's maximum takeoff weight.|$|R
5|$|The {{replacement}} of the Mk1's metal <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> with aluminium and glass fibre composite <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> saw these aircraft designated Chinook HC Mk1B. All surviving aircraft were later returned to Boeing and updated to the Chinook HC Mk2 standard for further service within the RAF.|$|R
25|$|Juan de la Cierva {{invented the}} modern {{autogyro}} (autogiro in Spanish) {{in the early}} 1920s. His first three designs (C.1, C.2, and C.3) were unstable because of aerodynamic and structural deficiencies in their rotors. His fourth design, the C.4, made the first documented flight of an autogyro on 17 January 1923, piloted by Alejandro Gomez Spencer at Cuatro Vientos airfield in Madrid, Spain (9 January according to Cierva). De la Cierva had fitted the rotor of the C.4 with flapping hinges to attach each <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> to the hub. The flapping hinges allowed each <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> to flap, or move up and down, to compensate for dissymmetry of lift, the difference in lift produced between {{the right and left}} sides of the rotor as the autogyro moves forward. Three days later, the engine failed shortly after takeoff and the aircraft descended slowly and steeply to a safe landing, validating De la Cierva's efforts to produce an aircraft that could be flown safely at low airspeeds.|$|E
25|$|In September 1995 {{in southwestern}} Washington State, a low–flying LongRanger was downed by a metal arrow {{launched}} by an irate deer hunter. The arrow pierced a <b>rotor</b> <b>blade,</b> bending the blade. The arrow shaft tore the tailfin and boom {{as it was}} being chopped up by the spinning rotor. The helicopter was still flyable, but the pilot made a precautionary landing to assess the damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect is}} a {{consequence}} of sand hitting helicopter rotors in sandy environments. Abrasion strips on helicopter rotor blades are made of metal, often titanium or nickel, which are very hard, but less hard than sand. When a helicopter flies low to the ground in desert environments, sand striking the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> can cause erosion. At night, sand hitting the metal abrasion strip causes a visible corona or halo around the rotor blades. The effect is caused by the pyrophoric oxidation of eroded particles and is known as the Kopp-Etchells Effect.|$|E

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} wind turbines, rotor planning principles are very important for wind turbines with horizontal axis. It {{is not possible to}} expect the maximum efficiency from a wind turbine that is installed without doing the optimization processes. At this point, <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> aerodynamic features are very important. It is necessary to put forward the power value that can be obtained from <b>rotor</b> <b>blades.</b> It is possible to conduct power tests indoors or under natural conditions. But in both methods, real <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> have to be produced. And this means cost. For this reason, first miniature blades can be produced and the tests can be conducted on these miniature <b>rotor</b> <b>blades.</b> This, along with theoretic studies, will help us to have a good opinion...|$|R

25|$|In April 2007, the AW119Ke (Ke {{standing}} for Koala Enhanced) was formally unveiled at Heli-Expo; changes included modified <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> design {{and a higher}} rotor rpm, increasing both payload and hot-and-high performance, cabin flexibility was also improved. The fuselages of the AW119 are manufactured by PZL Swidnik of Poland, later a subsidiary of AgustaWestland. Final assembly and other manufacturing activity initially took place at Vergiate, Italy; {{by the time the}} improved AW119Ke variant began production, the final assembly line had been transferred from Vergiate to AgustaWestland's facility in Philadelphia, United States.|$|E
25|$|Mitsubishi {{developed}} new main <b>rotor</b> <b>blade,</b> Ship Landing Assist System, new avionics system, {{and other}} systems. Two prototypes SH-60Ks were built by modifying SH-60Js. These prototypes were completed and delivered by June 2002. The SH-60K's cabin was expanded in length by 30cm (11.8in) and in height by 15cm (5.91in) {{compared to the}} SH-60J. The larger cabin allows for the new avionics system. Those and the airframe changes are compensated by the exchange of the T700-IHI-401C2 engine. The first production SH-60K was delivered to JMSDF on 10 August 2005. A total of 50 SH-60Ks are being supplied under new production.|$|E
25|$|The NH90 can be {{equipped}} with various mission-specific systems, including modular armor plating around the cabin area for undertaking high-risk missions and an ice protection system for operations within cold climates. It can also {{make use of the}} In-Hover Flight Refuelling System (HIFR) as well as additional internal and external fuel tanks to conduct extended range missions. Other equipment includes a wire strike protection system, rappelling system, hoist, cargo hook, search light and various seating options, including crashworthy foldable seats. For performing maritime operations, such tasked NH90s are typically equipped with the Harpoon deck-locking system, automatic main <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> and tail folding mechanisms, and other deck handling systems to conduct all-weather ship-borne operations; it is also typically outfitted with dipping sonar and sonobuoy processing equipment.|$|E

5000|$|A {{swashplate}} is {{a device}} that translates input via the helicopter flight controls into motion of the main <b>rotor</b> <b>blades.</b> Because the main <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> are spinning, the swashplate is used to transmit three of the pilot's commands from the non-rotating fuselage to the rotating rotor hub and mainblades.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of electrode {{material on the}} state of surfacing layer of steam turbine <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> is researched. The strengthened layer was produced by electro-spark alloying, using alloy T 15 K 6 and steel 15 X 11 МФШ. The microstructure, microhardness and thickness of surfacing layers were investigated. The advantages of steel 15 X 11 МФШ for strengthening the entrance edges of steam turbine <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> which makes it possible to simultaneously harden both the entrance edges of <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> as well as increase their erosive resistance are grounded...|$|R
25|$|The Lynx is an agile helicopter, {{capable of}} {{performing}} loops and rolls, and of attaining high speeds. The agility {{of the type}} led to its use as an aerial display aircraft, having been operated with by the Blue Eagles and Black Cats helicopter display teams. The efficiency of the main rotor, {{as well as the}} overall top speed of the Lynx, was substantially improved with the adoption of BERP <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> technology. During the 1990s, the hot-and-high performance of the type was considerably boosted in the later Super Lynx 200 series, at which point the type's Gem engines were replaced with the newer LHTEC T800 turboshaft engine with associated FADEC system; the Lynx can also maintain a good level of performance under moderate icing conditions. The FADEC controls eliminated the requirement for a throttle or manual speed selection switches, further simplifying flight control. Later aircraft feature automatic stabilisation equipment; functions such as auto-hover are optionally installed on some Lynx.|$|E
