30|$|The <b>washing</b> <b>nozzle</b> used in {{this study}} could vacuum almost all the {{contaminated}} water when adhered to the ground. However, as in the experiment described in the previous section, the movement of the nozzle was affected by the noise that resulted from the precision of the laser range finder. Hence, water leaked through the gap between the nozzle and the ground and wetted the surrounding un-decontaminated area. Because the laser range finder was one of the photo-sensors, the measured data of the wet and dry target areas were different. The water leakage therefore made decontamination by the proposed system difficult.|$|R

To accelerate the decontamination without decreasing the efficiency, multiple robots working in coordination are employed in the proposed system.

30|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a high-pressure washing system {{for use in the}} decontamination of radioactive substances spread by the accident that occurred at the TEPCO Fukushima 1 st Nuclear Power Plant. The proposal was prompted by the unsatisfactory progress of decontamination workers in residential areas. The proposed system, which is targeted at accelerating the decontamination activities, consists of multiple washing and transporter robots. The washing robots execute highly efficient decontamination using commercially available high-pressure washing equipment, and work in coordination with the transporter robots to shorten the decontamination time. The concept of the proposed system and the control algorithm of the high-pressure <b>washing</b> <b>nozzle</b> were described in this paper, as well as the experimental validation of the proposed system. The proposed system and method cannot only be utilized in residential areas, but also in high-radiation-dose areas such as around a brown nuclear reactor. Furthermore, a worker can transport the washing robot for its separate use. In a future work, we would demonstrate the proposed system using a nozzle control that is not based on photo-sensors, and also propose ways for accelerating decontamination activities by industry-academia-government collaboration.|$|R
30|$|The {{guidelines}} of the Ministry of the Environment describe the normal {{use of the machine}} for decontamination. This involves holding the <b>washing</b> <b>nozzle</b> near the waist, blasting the water against the target such as the road or wall, and washing the entire surface. In the proposed method, however, the nozzle is not held near the waist but very close to the target. To be specific, the distance between the nozzle and the target is controlled at about 0.01 m. Regardless of the water pressure, as the distance between the nozzle and the target decreases, the impact of the collision increases [4]. The proposed method therefore increases the impact generated by the commercially available machine. Moreover, a sufficiently high impact finely destroys the surface of the target [5]. Hence, the system not only washes off the radioactive substances {{on the surface of the}} target, but also removes those that have been absorbed into pores on the surface. In other words, the proposed method is used to grind the surface of the target by means of a commercially available high-pressure washing machine. Thus, the method has the ease of use of high-pressure washing and the efficiency of grinding.|$|R

Operating conditions and particulate loadings for the test unit were monitored, Teflon{reg_sign} film thickness measurements were conducted, and surface replications (which duplicate the surface finish at the microscopic level) were taken at various times during the test. Data from the test indicate that virtually no decrease in Teflon{reg_sign} thickness was observed for the coating on the first two rows of heat exchanger tubes, even at high inlet particulate loadings (400 mg/dscm [0. 35 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu]).

40|$|A modern {{gas turbine}} compressor, with its highly aerodynamically loaded blades, is {{sensitive}} to changes in profile shape and to surface roughness. Fouling is inevitable, despite highly efficient filtration systems. The remedy to this problem is washing. There are two different approaches, online or off-line washing. The off-line wash {{is the most effective}} one, whilst on-line washing only prolongs the interval between off-line washes. Most findings in this field are highly empirical, being based on some 50 years of industrial gas turbine operation. This paper is an investigation of the two-phase flow in the bellmouth of the compressor during off-line washing conditions. The unit under study was the GTX 100 turbo-set. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used in this paper to perform a detailed study of the flow field. The main emphasis has been on studying the characteristics of the injected spray used for cleaning of the compressor. The benefit of heating this fluid is of special interest, since if this heating can be avoided, the outage time for the off-line compressor wash can be shortened. To provide the CFD computations with accurate boundary conditions for the spray, laser-based measurements of a spray, originating from an authentic <b>wash</b> <b>nozzle,</b> have been conducted. The commercial CFD program Star-Cd has been used for all computations. The computations show that the water injected, regardless of its inlet temperature, is cooled down to ambient air temperature well before the spray reaches the inlet guide vanes.

The spatial rainfall distribution and his intensity were measured with 63 rainfall gauges covering the whole plot The Joss Waldvogel Disdrometer was used to characterize the rainfall produced by the rainfall simulator. The drop size distribution was obtained. The drop size spectrum ranges from 0. 25 mm to 3. 3 mm and its shape is the same to that one produced by a natural rainfall. The rainfall intensity varies from approximately 31 to 62 mm/h and it is sufficiently spatially uniform (Christiansen's coefficient of uniformity is 0. 62 to 0. 75) over the plot. Field tests were carried out in on a grassy field with silt-loam soil in Orroli, Sardinia in July and August 2010. The values of the mean rainfall intensities obtained from field data are in accord with the laboratory values. The field site measurement includes the surface runoff, evaluated using a dedicated tipping bucket flow meter, and the soil water content measured throughout the field experiments. The results showed the good performance of this new rainfall simulator that offers the possibility to reproduce natural rainfall to gather parameters needed for hydrologic modeling.

40|$|The thesis aims {{to analyse}} the gas turbine based energy {{conversion}} systems {{with the emphasis}} on combustion chambers. The investigation is mainly experimental at a component level. The majority of investigations concentrate on gaseous fuel firing. The influence of swirl, heat release and combustor geometry on the turbulent flows in a generic premixed gas turbine combustor, is investigated using particle image velocimetry (PIV), laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). The goal is to characterize the main flow structures and turbulence in a model combustor that is relevant to gas turbines during Natural Gas firing. An explanation for the underlying mechanisms is presented to describe the effect of swirl, heat release and outlet contraction on the flow field. CO, NOx and total unburned HC were measured at the outlet of the combustor, and the influence of mass flow rate, inlet temperature, and addition of CO 2 – diluent was investigated. The combustor’s behaviour, particularly in the lean part of its range of operation, was investigated to assess some of the problems associated with combustion in suggested power plants for CO 2 rich bio-fuels and CO 2 capture/sequestration. The partially reformed mixtures can be formed using biomass. Before combusting these mixtures in a gas turbine, experimental work was done on the generic combustion chamber to examine the off-design combustor behaviour when switching from natural gas to the wet and dry generic hydrogen-rich mixtures. The thesis reports work on liquid atomisation. Although technical applications make use of well distributed and finely dispersed sprays, the injectors may operate under off-design conditions of low Weber numbers. A low We water spray subjected to an air cross-flow which similar to pre-vaporisers of lean premixed pre-vaporising (LPP) burners is studied. PIV and PDA have been used to quantify both the continuous and dispersed phases. A long range microscope has been used to characterize the column breakup process. Investigation of synthetic liquid fuel combustion in the generic combustor {{has been a part of}} this thesis. An experimental comparison of the synthetic jet fuel and jet A 1 is performed. Emissions of NOX, CO and HC, ignition and extinction points, liner temperatures, soot levels in the combustor are studied. Modern gas turbine compressors are sensitive to changes in profile shape and to surface roughness with their highly loaded blades. The remedy to fouling problem is washing. The thesis work includes an investigation of the two-phase flow in the bellmouth of the compressor during off-line washing conditions. The main emphasis has been on studying the characteristics of the injected spray used for cleaning of the compressor. The used nozzles are akin to pressure swirl nozzles for liquid fuel injection. To provide with accurate boundary conditions for the spray, laser-based measurements of a spray, originating from an authentic <b>wash</b> <b>nozzle,</b> have been conducted. The other branch of this study aims to describe the behaviour of a generic combustor under off-design conditions that are reflecting the current trend of bio-fuels in the gas turbine power industry. Since it is rather rare to have custom-built gas turbines for low calorific value operation, the engine will be forced to operate outside its design envelope. Typical restraints are decrease in Wobbe-index and surge- and flutter-margins for turbomachinery. In this study, an advanced performance deck has been used to quantify the impact of firing low calorific value gases in a generic type gas turbine. A single-shaft gas turbine characterized by a compressor and an expander map is considered. Emphasis has been put on predicting the off-design behavior.

The aim of the formative research was to assess the need for an intensive water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and poultry-related hygiene component that could be rolled out alongside the SELEVER intervention {{in the context of the}} cluster randomized controlled trial. This paper is based on an observational mixed-methods study that included a literature review, pathways analysis, and primary and secondary data analysis. A theory-based framework was developed to map the different pathways linking WASH, animal husbandry practices, and child nutrition and development outcomes. This framework was used to critically review the literature on each of the pathways involved. Hygiene-related programmatic materials from the SELEVER intervention were also reviewed. Secondary data were analyzed on livestock <b>rearing,</b> <b>WASH</b> practices, and exposure to human and livestock feces. Primary research included data collection from three selected villages where SELEVER activities were being piloted, including direct observations of 20 caregiver-child pairs, in-depth interviews, and focus groups. The literature review suggested that WASH interventions have substantial potential for improving child nutrition, though the evidence on their effectiveness is far from definitive. The secondary data analysis confirmed that exposure to poultry and poultry feces is extremely widespread in Burkina Faso. Fully 80 percent of rural households owned poultry, and most poultry could roam freely throughout the compound. Visible animal feces were reported in 84 percent of compounds in both the CHANGE and PROMIS surveys. Moreover, WASH practices and general hygiene were very low: toilet ownership was extremely low (22 percent nationally), water supply was a major constraint, and handwashing with soap was very rare (in the CHANGE survey, only 2 percent of households reported having soap for handwashing). The primary data confirmed the poor state of WASH, extreme exposure to poultry and poultry feces, and poor knowledge of the risks associated with children’s exposure to animal feces. The hygiene-related content of the SELEVER intervention focuses primarily on the promotion of practical measures to improve WASH-related practices at the household level, including food preparation, water and sanitation, and waste management, with some messaging on the risks of exposure to animal feces. Emerging evidence suggests that exposure to animal feces is an important health risk for young children. However, the question of how to best mitigate this risk programmatically is still unclear. In rural Burkina Faso, the general WASH environment appears severely constrained, and free-scavenging poultry production systems are ubiquitous. These findings suggest the opportunity to develop a community-oriented behavioral change intervention that emphasizes, rather than isolates, the importance of reducing children’s exposure to poultry feces. In the context of SELEVER, this intervention would aim to increase production and consumption of poultry products while concomitantly reducing children’s exposure to poultry feces. Scaling up an intensive WASH package alongside the standard SELEVER intervention in the context of the randomized trial would provide rigorous, policy-relevant evidence in this emerging field.

And, finally, they were optimized by washing test and showering simulation. Results: On showering importance of body parts were able to analysis through observation of elderly behavior. The position of nozzle and angle of water injection was able to optimize by showering simulation. The automatic showering system was developed by considering their results. Conclusion: The most important technology of developing a showering system is the determining position of nozzle and angle of water injection, number of nozzle. It was developed by applying its results through user centered-research. Application: The user centered-research of developing products was able to apply directly to develop automatic bath, showering products etc. Further more it was available to apply senio...|$|R
