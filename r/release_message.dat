25|$|A newly {{allocated}} object {{created with}} alloc or copy has a retain count of one. Sending that object a retain message increments the retain count, while sending it a <b>release</b> <b>message</b> decrements the retain count. When an object's retain count reaches zero, it is deallocated by a procedure {{similar to a}} C++ destructor. dealloc is not guaranteed to be invoked.|$|E
25|$|One {{feature of}} the Cocoa {{environment}} is its facility for managing dynamically allocated memory. Cocoa's NSObject class, from which most classes, both vendor and user, are derived, implements a reference counting scheme for memory management. Objects that derive from the NSObject root class respond to a retain and a <b>release</b> <b>message,</b> and keep a retain count. A method titled retainCount exists, but contrary to its name, will usually not return the exact retain count of an object. It is mainly used for system-level purposes. Invoking it manually is not recommended by Apple.|$|E

50|$|Neuroendocrine {{cells are}} cells that receive {{neuronal}} input (neurotransmitters released by nerve cells or neurosecretory cells) and, {{as a consequence}} of this input, <b>release</b> <b>message</b> molecules (hormones) to the blood. In this way they bring about an integration between the nervous system and the endocrine system, a process known as neuroendocrine integration. An example of a neuroendocrine cell is a cell of the adrenal medulla (innermost part of the adrenal gland), which releases adrenaline to the blood. The adrenal medullary cells are controlled by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. These cells are modified postganglionic neurons. Autonomic nerve fibers lead directly to them from the central nervous system. The adrenal medullary hormones are kept in vesicles much in the same way neurotransmitters are kept in neuronal vesicles. Hormonal effects can last up to ten times longer than those of neurotransmitters. Sympathetic nerve fiber impulses stimulate the release of adrenal medullary hormones. In this way the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system and the medullary secretions function together.|$|E

Upon completion of this process, a positive release acknowledgement message shall be returned to the releasing ISC. Failure to complete the release shall be reported to the releasing ISC using the out-of-service message and the DCME shall put the trunk in a blocked condition. After manual or automatic removal of any failure condition, the DCME shall put the trunk in an idle condition and send a back-in-service message to the ISC. A calling end DCME shall detect a release initiated by the opposite end (non-controlling) ISC by the reception of a disconnect message in the control channel.
