40|$|In {{all forms}} of chronic hypertension, the renal-pressure {{natriuresis}} mechanism is abnormal because sodium excretion {{is the same as}} in normotension despite the increased blood pressure. However, the importance <b>of</b> this <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> pressure natriuresis as a cause of hypertension is controversial. Theoretically, a <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> pressure natriuresis could necessitate increased blood pressure to maintain sodium balance or it could occur secondarily to hypertension. Recent studies indicate that, in several models of experimental hypertension (including angiotensin II, aldosterone, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, and norepinephrine hypertension), a primary shift of renal-pressure natriuresis necessitates increased arterial pressure to maintain sodium and water balance. In genetic animal models of hypertension, there also appears to be a <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> pressure natriuresis before the development of hypertension. Likewise, essential hypertensive patients exhibit abnormal pressure natriuresis, although the precise cause of this defect is not clear. It is likely that multiple renal defects contribute to <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> pressure natriuresis in essential hypertensive patients. With long-standing hyper-tension, pathological changes that occur secondary to hypertension must also be considered. By analyzing the characteristics of pressure natriuresis in hypertensive patients and by comparin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{array of}} phase retarders {{can be used}} as an optical phased array OPA to steer light McManamon et al., Proc. IEEE 842, 268 – 298 1996. The {{introduction}} <b>of</b> <b>resets</b> enables steering to larger angles without requiring an optical path difference OPD greater than one wavelength. These resets, however, are correct only at the design wave-length. The beam steerer is therefore very dispersive. It has been shown theoretically that <b>resets</b> <b>of</b> an integer multiple of the wavelength will make the beam steerer less dispersive McManamon and Watson, Proc. SPIE 4369, 140 – 148 2001. We offer the first experimental proof that <b>resets</b> <b>of</b> n are less dispersive than <b>resets</b> <b>of</b> a single. We also show experimentally that the dispersion associated with fixed period resets does vary, but only within a fixed limit. Last, we show the equivalent of power shifting from one order to the next as larger resets move from being divisible by one integer times the nondesign wavelength toward being divisible by the next integer times the nondesign wavelength...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is two-fold. First, via a {{critical}} review of available studies on the adult L 2 <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> the Null-Subject Parameter (NSP) and in light of a typologically wide sampling of languages, we conclude that the NSP cluster is much narrower in scope than is reflected in the design and discussion of most L 2 studies. Secondly, we present original research on the L 2 <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> the NSP by two groups of adult English intermediate learners of L 2 Spanish: a study-abroad group and a class-room only group. We seek to quantify the extent to which study-abroad experience, that is, increased exposure to native input, is beneficial specifically as it relates to the acquisition of new functional features needed for parameter re-setting (cf. Isabelli 2004). Despite the observable and clandestine linguistic benefits to study-abroad, our data suggest that for the <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> the NSP, at least, such exposure to native input is not particularly gainful...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} {{and extent of}} rapid or acute <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> the aortic baroreceptors were studied in long-term renal hypertensive rats during 30 minutes of sustained hypertension produced by phenylephrine infusion. The aortic baroreceptors of hypertensive rats exhibited complete resetting to hypertension because during the control period the systolic threshold pressure for activation of the baroreceptors was similar (137 ± 5 vs. 142 ± 4 mm Hg) to the control diastolic pressure. Five minutes after onset <b>of</b> hypertension, a <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> 32 % (percent change of mean pressure threshold divided by total change of mean pressure) was demonstrable. The extent <b>of</b> <b>resetting</b> was 39 %, 38 %, and 41 % after 10, 20, and 30 minutes of hypertension, respectively. When the percent change of systolic threshold pressure divided by total change of control diastolic pressure was {{used to calculate the}} extent <b>of</b> <b>resetting,</b> similar results were obtained. The extent of displacement of the entire baroreceptor pressure-response curves was similar to that of pressure thresholds.

40|$|Working memory (WM) is {{the ability}} to retain and {{associate}} information over brief time intervals. Functional imaging studies demonstrate that WM is mediated by a distributed network including frontal and posterior cortices, hippocampus, and cerebellum. In rodents, the presentation of stimuli in a WM task is followed by a <b>reset</b> <b>of</b> the phase of hippocampal theta. In this paper we report the observation of a similar phenomenon in normal human subjects. Neuromagnetic responses were recorded during presentation of a set of digits and a subsequent probe of the retained items. All stimuli were presented with a fixed temporal pattern. We observed phase <b>reset</b> <b>of</b> ≈ 7 Hz theta in left hippocampus ≈ 120 ms after probe stimuli, whereas <b>reset</b> <b>of</b> theta in right hippocampus was visible ≈ 80 ms prior to these anticipated stimuli. The duration of stimulus-locked theta increased with memory load, with a limiting value of ≈ 600 ms for 5 – 7 retained items. We suggest that, as in rats, stimulus-locked theta may index involvement of human hippocampal networks in the cognitive processing of sensory input. The anticipatory phase <b>reset</b> <b>of</b> theta indicates involvement of hippocampus in right hemisphere and cerebellar timing networks. Hippocampal structures are essential for orientation to perturbations in the sensory scene, a function that requires use of a context established by a constellation of stimuli. We suggest that the initiation and maintenance of stimulus-locked hippocampal theta observed here may facilitate processing of potentially salient and/or novel input with respect to a context established by the contents of WM...|$|R
