5|$|Bradman's {{relentless}} use of {{his pace}} attack and fieldsmen also <b>raised</b> <b>eyebrows.</b> At the time, Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers, with high pace {{and the ability to}} deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the English batsmen. Prior to the Second World War, pace bowlers were generally much slower and did not often bowl at the body. England had yet to develop bowlers such as Lindwall and Miller, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At times, the public found Lindwall and Miller's short-pitched bowling to be excessive and booed the Australians. On the fielding front, Barnes was deployed as close to the bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point, with one foot on the pitch. This had an intimidatory effect on the batsmen and led many to question whether it was {{in the spirit of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|After a long-awaited {{pre-season}} {{after the}} agreements from the NFL lockout, {{and the release}} of Delhomme, McCoy became the starter for the Browns. In the home opener against the Bengals, McCoy threw 19 for 40 attempts throwing 213 yards with two touchdowns and one interception in a 27-17 loss. The next two weeks, the Browns defeated the Indianapolis Colts and the Miami Dolphins with McCoy throwing combined 41 of 71 attempts, 421 yards, and 3 touchdowns with 1 interception. Against the Tennessee Titans in week 5, McCoy threw 1 touchdown and 1 interception in a 13-31 loss. After a bye week, McCoy and the Browns lost to the Oakland Raiders 17-24, McCoy threw for 215 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. After the loss to the Oakland Raiders the Browns played the Seattle Seahawks and won 6-3 as McCoy finished with 178 yards, no touchdowns, and 1 interception. Against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 14, McCoy threw 2 interceptions and no touchdowns in a 3-14 loss where McCoy would also sustain a concussion. His father <b>raised</b> <b>eyebrows</b> when he questioned whether or not McCoy's team had properly evaluated him for the concussion prior to returning to the game. McCoy stated that he did not remember anything. James Harrison, the Steelers player responsible for the helmet-to-helmet hit on McCoy, was subsequently punished by being suspended for the Steelers' next game against the San Francisco 49ers.|$|E

25|$|During Benaud's captaincy, Australia did {{not lose}} a series, and became the {{dominant}} team in world cricket. His success was based {{on his ability to}} attack, his tactical boldness and his ability to extract more performance from his players, in particular Davidson. He was known for his unbuttoned shirt, and <b>raised</b> <b>eyebrows</b> with his on-field exuberance. Benaud embraced his players when opposition wickets fell, something that was uncommon at the time. Benaud's bold leadership coupled with his charismatic nature and public relations ability enlivened interest in Test cricket among a public who had increasingly regarded it as boring.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later in the Second Test at Melbourne, with Benaud still absent, Simpson led Australia for the first time. Simpson's {{appointment}} to the top job <b>raised</b> <b>eyebrows</b> in some quarters, as he {{had a reputation for}} being abrasive, and others had been more successful and experienced at domestic level. Lawry had led Victoria to the Sheffield Shield in 1962–63 and Western Australia's Barry Shepherd had also been praised for his aggressive and bold leadership. At the time Simpson had scored only 1246 runs at 32.78 and taken 22 wickets at 39.40 in 23 Tests and had not scored a century.|$|E

25|$|Marco Andretti was {{the first}} driver to make a {{significant}} improvement on his starting position, putting himself tentatively on the pole. The next car out, Ed Carpenter, <b>raised</b> <b>eyebrows</b> with a first lap of 229.347 mph, and a four-lap average of 228.762 mph. Carpenter bumped Andretti off the top spot, but still had four drivers waiting to make attempts. Rookie Carlos Muñoz squeezed himself on to the front row, landing in second starting position. The final driver with a shot for the pole was Will Power, who was fastest in segment 1. Power's first lap was in the 229 mph range, but his third and fourth laps dropped off significantly. Power ended up 6th, and Ed Carpenter secured his first Indy 500 pole position. It {{was the first}} pole for an American-born driver since Sam Hornish, Jr. in 2006, and the first by an owner/driver since A. J. Foyt in 1975.|$|E
25|$|Topic marking 2 (tm2) and topic marking 3 (tm3) {{are both}} used with base-generated topics. Tm2 is {{characterized}} by <b>raised</b> <b>eyebrows,</b> widened eyes, and the head tilted backwards and to the side. Toward {{the end of the}} sign the head moves forward and to the opposite side, and there is a pause and often an eye blink before continuing. For tm3 the eyebrows are raised and the eyes are opened wide, the head starts tilted down and jerks up and down, the lips are opened and raised, and the head is nodded rapidly a few times before pausing and continuing the sentence. Although both tm2 and tm3 accompany base-generated topics, they are used in different contexts. Tm2 is used to introduce new information and change the topic of a conversation to something that the signer is going to subsequently characterize, while tm3 is used to introduce new information that the signer believes is already known by his/her interlocutor. Tm2 may be used with any base-generated topic, whereas only topics that are co-referential with an argument in the sentence may be marked with tm3.|$|E

25|$|Cooper {{travelled}} {{down to the}} 1960 Argentine Grand Prix seemingly at {{the peak}} of their powers, and Trintignant won the Buenos Aires F1 event that preceded the main championship race. However {{this turned out to be}} the last major win for a T51, as the speed of the new Lotus 18 <b>raised</b> <b>eyebrows</b> around the paddock. On the journey back, John Cooper made his mind up that to stay at the front he needed to build a new car, and at the next championship race at Monaco the lowline T53 made its debut. In the meantime Moss took the Walker T51 to second in the Glover Trophy and qualified on pole position for the International Trophy before retiring with wishbone failure. Rob Walker had already bought a Lotus 18 for Moss, but ironically the Englishman was to miss a large part of the season through injuries sustained when his notoriously fragile Lotus lost a wheel at speed in Belgium. Cooper entered the T51 just three more times, with Scarab refugee Chuck Daigh and journeyman Ron Flockhart retiring each time.|$|E

25|$|In May 2014, Singaporean {{businessman}} Peter Lim {{was designated}} by the Fundación Valencia CF as the buyer of 70.4% of the shares owned by the club's foundation. After months of negotiations between Lim and Bankia (the main creditor of the club), an agreement was reached in August 2014. Juan Antonio Pizzi was unexpectedly sacked as head coach and replaced by Nuno Espírito Santo on 2 July 2014. Later, Salvo revealed {{in an interview that}} hiring Nuno was one of the conditions Lim had insisted on when buying the club. This <b>raised</b> <b>eyebrows</b> in the media because of Nuno's close relationship with the football agent Jorge Mendes, whose first-ever client was Nuno. Lim and Mendes are also close friends and business partners. Regardless, Nuno's first season was a successful one. Notable signings included Álvaro Negredo, André Gomes and Enzo Pérez, who had just won the LPFP Primeira Liga Player of the Year in the Portuguese Primeira Liga. Valencia finished the 2014–15 season in fourth place for Champions League qualification with 77 points, just one point ahead of Sevilla after a dramatic final week, defeating Granada 4–0.|$|E

25|$|Kỳ {{was well}} known for his flamboyant, {{colorful}} conduct and dress during his younger days. His trademark fashion accessory before he faded from public view in the 1970s was a silk scarf, which he wore with his black flight suit. He often <b>raised</b> <b>eyebrows</b> {{when he was the}} military prime minister by arriving at events to meet civilians with his wife in matching black flight suits, boots, blue caps, and silk scarves. He rarely was seen without a cigarette. He was notorious for his love of gambling, women, and glamour, which made American officials wary of him. One official called him an “unguided missile.” When he was a young pilot, Kỳ once landed a helicopter in the road in front of a girlfriend's house in order to impress her, causing the locals to panic and earning the ire of his commander for misusing military equipment. On one occasion, Kỳ is said to have pulled a handgun on a journalist whose questions annoyed him. Many in the South Vietnamese public service, military, and the general public hated his tempestuous and impetuous style and regarded him as a “cowboy.” and a “hooligan.” At his only public campaign appearance during the 1967 presidential election, the large crowd repeatedly heckled him loudly, calling him a “cowboy leader” and “hooligan” and as a result he did not make any more appearances at rallies.|$|E
25|$|AAA paid Manson {{the entire}} 10 months {{he was out}} with an injury, which was why rumors of Manson's jump to the Perros del Mal {{promotion}} caused some <b>raised</b> <b>eyebrows.</b> Los Perros del Mal even {{held a press conference}} to announce that he had signed with the company. In the end it appeared that either the rumors and the press conference were part of a major angle, or that Manson changed his mind before signing a contract as he returned to AAA in February. Manson returned to the ring on February 15, 2009 during a television taping to help El Mesias (Formerly Muerta Cibernetica) as he was being attacked by Konnan and La Legión. Three days later at another television taping Manson made his in ring return, teaming with Latin Lover and X-Pac to defeat Konnan, Electroshock and El Zorro. On March 15, 2009 at the 2009 Rey de Reyes Manson teamed with D-Generation-Mex members X-Pac and Alex Koslov losing to the team of El Zorro, Teddy Hart and Jack Evans, after which Juventud Guerrera made his return to the promotion to help the Manson's team out. The storyline with El Zorro concluded at Triplemania XVII where Manson, X-Pac and Rocky Romero defeated El Zorro, Dark Ozz and Dark Scoria. In the summer of 2009 the storyline between Chessman and Charly Manso that had been brewing since Manson's return in the spring finally started to evolve, the two faced off in several tag team matches, leading into their first one-on-one match at the 2009 Verano de Escandalo event. The two faced off in a Streetfight that saw Charly Manson win by submission. Manson and Chessman were scheduled to face off in a Luchas de Apuesta in the main event of AAA's Heroes Inmortales III. In the week leading up to the event Manson announced that he had left AAA and would not be participating in the match. On the Mexican wrestling program Tercera Caída Manson stated that he left AAA because he was not given enough dates to earn a living and unlike the non-Mexican AAA workers {{he did not have a}} guaranteed contract. He also stated that he was not offered enough money to lose to Chessman, revealing that the original ending to Manson vs. Chessman was for Chessman to win. On September 24, 2009 AAA, through Marisela Peña and Joaquín Roldan, confirmed that Charly Manson had indeed left AAA.|$|E
