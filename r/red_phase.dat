The new cadets officially begin <b>Red</b> <b>Phase</b> upon returning from pass at 1830 (6:30 pm) for their first study hours Sunday evening. A freshman cadet typically has eight-and-a-half hours of unstructured time during a weekday in which to attend classes, study, run errands, and workout. <b>Red</b> <b>Phase,</b> like the color red, is the most intense phase, and the new cadets continue to be trained by their cadre (juniors and seniors who were specifically trained to train the freshmen). They will be expected to learn topics from The Guidon, the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets book of knowledge and will be quizzed on topics from the Guidon during [...] "Freshmen Online", more commonly referred to as [...] "onlines". Onlines are conducted Monday through Thursday and last for one-half hour.

50|$|Nucleation {{is usually}} a {{stochastic}} (random) process, so even in two identical systems nucleation will occur at different times. This behaviour is similar to radioactive decay. A common mechanism is illustrated in the animation to the right. This shows nucleation of a new phase (shown in red) in an existing phase (white). In the existing phase microscopic fluctuations of the <b>red</b> <b>phase</b> appear and decay continuously, until an unusually large fluctuation of the new <b>red</b> <b>phase</b> is so large it is more favourable for it to grow than to shrink back to nothing. This nucleus of the <b>red</b> <b>phase</b> then grows and converts the system to this phase. The standard theory that describes this behaviour for the nucleation of a new thermodynamic phase is called classical nucleation theory.|$|E

It was also found that drivers at the intersections with traditional pedestrian signals exhibited different stopping behavior near the intersection, possibly related to sudden braking.

5000|$|The {{chromatic}} {{transition from}} blue to <b>red</b> <b>phase</b> of PDA {{is caused by}} the electronic structure of PDAs' backbone which is featured by the alternative carbon double bond and carbon triple bond. Upon exposure to the external stimuli such as thermal, chemical and mechanical stimulus, the conjugation effect will endow the chromatic properties to this type material. As far as the pure or [...] "intrinsic" [...] PDAs are concerned, the blue to <b>red</b> <b>phase</b> transition is irreversible, however if the head groups of the PDAs' side chain are strengthened by other structure, for example chelation with metal oxide nanoparticles, it could provide resilience of the backbone to conduct the reversible color change. Several recent researches which assisted by DFT simulation have shown that the chromatic properties could be modified by adjusting the side chain structures of PDA. With the development thin film fabrication technology such as inkjet printing, PDAs could be coated on different substrate materials as multifunctional sensor, for example Kapton films, aluminum foil or even conventional paper.|$|E
50|$|Also, due to {{the large}} {{intersection}} area, the traffic lights need a longer yellow and <b>red</b> <b>phase</b> to clear the intersection, and even then {{it may not be}} long enough for a bicyclist entering on green or yellow to make it across before opposing traffic gets a green. In general, SPUI designs should not be used where bicycle traffic is expected unless fairly substantial changes to the design or special accommodations are provided.|$|E

50|$|Algae are {{the primary}} natural source of {{astaxanthin}} in the aquatic food chain. Currently, the primary industrial source for natural astaxanthin is the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis. Haematococcus pluvialis seems to accumulate {{the highest levels of}} astaxanthin in nature. Commercially, more than 40 g of astaxanthin can be obtained from one kg of dry biomass. Haematococcus pluvialis has the advantage of the population doubling every week, which means scaling up is not an issue. However, it does require some expertise to grow the algae with a high astaxanthin content. Specifically, the microalgae are grown in two phases. First, in the green phase, the cells are given an abundance of nutrients to promote proliferation of the cells. In the subsequent <b>red</b> <b>phase,</b> the cells are deprived of nutrients and subjected to intense sunlight to induce encystment (carotogenesis), during which the cells produce high levels of astaxanthin as a protective mechanism against the environmental stress. The cells, with their high concentrations of astaxanthin, are then harvested.|$|E
