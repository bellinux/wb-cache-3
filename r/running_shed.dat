5|$|George Ivatt's 1945 {{report also}} {{recommended}} {{the removal of}} all streamlining casings and they {{were removed from the}} fitted locomotives from 1946 onwards. It had been found to be of little value at speeds below , and was unpopular with <b>running</b> <b>shed</b> employees as it caused difficulty of access for maintenance. The first step towards de-streamlining was carried out during the Second World War when many of the streamlined tenders had their side sheets cut away {{at the rear of the}} tender. Many photographs exist showing this measure. The removal of the streamlining proper commenced in April 1946 with No. 6235 City of Birmingham. All de-streamlining coincided with the fitting of smoke deflectors. No. 6243 City of Lancaster was renumbered as 46243 in April 1948 and as it was not de-streamlined until May 1949, when it became the only locomotive to carry its British Railways number while streamlined.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, {{the route}} {{classification}} {{was changed to}} Yellow because of the 5700s' low hammer blow. The change {{did not apply to}} Nos. 9700–10. This meant that 5700s were now allowed on almost 90% of the old GWR network (roughly equivalent to the new Western Region of British Rail). By 1954 only five <b>running</b> <b>sheds</b> (Abercynon, Aberystwyth, Machynlleth, Treherbert and Truro) did not have any 5700s allocated.|$|R
50|$|In September 1904, the Eastfield <b>Running</b> <b>Sheds</b> {{were built}} {{on the other side}} of the Glasgow-Edinburgh mainline, just to the north of the Cowlairs complex, to {{maintain}} locomotives and to free-up more engineering space at Cowlairs Works. They were closed in 1994 but the depot site was redeveloped in 2005 and is once again in use as a maintenance facility for Class 170 trains by First ScotRail.|$|R

50|$|The various <b>running</b> <b>sheds</b> {{began to}} be run down during the 1930s {{as part of a}} re-organisation scheme {{involving}} new developments at Norwood Junction, but the onset of war meant that they were not formally closed until 1947 and were used for stabling locomotive until 1951. They were demolished in 1957 together with the repair workshops, and replaced by sidings for the storage of electric multiple units.|$|R

50|$|The Central Line {{continued}} to expand throughout {{the early part}} of the twentieth century. A major element of this expansion was the approval construction of the North Coast railway line to Mackay. With additional mileage being opened extra services were provided by the Railway Department to cope with increased patronage. New workshop and <b>running</b> <b>sheds</b> were also required to maintain and service the extra rollingstock operating on the Central line.|$|R
50|$|Derby Castle Depôt is {{the main}} {{location}} of workshops and <b>running</b> <b>sheds</b> of the Manx Electric Railway on the Isle of Man and lies at the northerly end of the promenade at Douglas; it {{takes its name from}} the adjoining site which was once home to the Earls of Derby, rulers of the island, and later extended to form an entertainment complex of the same name before being demolished and replaced by the ill-fated Summerland complex in 1968.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{being under}} one mile long, the railway does have {{intermediate}} stations, although {{only one of}} them is still operational for passengers and the other forms the site of the current passing loop when two trains are in operation (this was extended in 2011 to allow trains with more coaches to pass each other unhindered); the outer terminus is home to the visitor centre whilst the inner station houses all the <b>running</b> <b>sheds</b> and the railway's workshops.|$|R
50|$|The <b>running</b> <b>shed</b> had {{a triple}} gauge line leading {{down into the}} {{standard}} gauge storage sidings and then across the Field Railway where a short stub led into a field.|$|E
50|$|Operations are {{centred on}} Belgrave, which houses the main {{offices of the}} railway (other offices are located at Emerald) {{as well as the}} {{locomotive}} <b>running</b> <b>shed</b> and locomotive workshops. It is also the base for track maintenance operations.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{demonstrates the}} characteristics of a steam locomotive <b>running</b> <b>shed</b> and maintenance depot consisting of stalls in a covered environment, inspection pits, centrally located locomotive turning facility, storage roads radiating from a central point, and boiler washout facility.|$|E
50|$|The 1600 imp gal {{on-board}} {{water tank}} {{on the front}} engine unit was only used when the water tender was temporarily disconnected from the engine at <b>running</b> <b>sheds,</b> where the locomotives had to detach and run around their water tenders to change direction. While the locomotives were still shedded at Braamfontein before the new depot at Millsite in Krugersdorp was opened, their water tenders were usually only re-attached when the engines left the depot to save space.|$|R
50|$|The {{first trial}} {{run along the}} line with a train was on 13 April 1865. The first section of line between Ipswich and Bigges Camp (a {{distance}} of twenty-one miles) was officially opened to traffic to great public fanfare on 31 July 1865. The line ran from the Bremer Bridge and passed the original workshops and <b>running</b> <b>sheds</b> (North Ipswich Railway Workshops) {{to the west and}} crossed Wide Gully. Extensions to the line were later made to Toowoomba (1867), Dalby (1868) and Warwick (1871).|$|R
50|$|The rotary cam {{poppet valve}} gear {{consists}} of two admission valves and two exhaust valves per cylinder, operated by a camshaft arranged in a box fixed to each cylinder between the valve chambers. The cam boxes are self-contained and detachable, and replacement cam boxes can be fitted at <b>running</b> <b>sheds</b> within a few hours. The camshafts are driven from the return cranks on the driving wheels through worm wheels and universal propeller shafts, arranged so that the camshafts and the coupled wheels revolve at the same speed.|$|R
5000|$|Llanfair Caereinion [...] {{railway station}} located in Llanfair Caereinion is the Western {{terminus}} {{of the narrow}} gauge Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway. The locomotive <b>running</b> <b>shed</b> and workshop are located here, along with a Tea Room and gift shop.|$|E
50|$|Included in {{the complex}} was a <b>running</b> <b>shed,</b> opened in 1884, for steam {{locomotives}} used in the daily duties of train haulage. Originally of three bays, the first was demolished about 1925 and the remaining two in the early 1960s.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{constructed}} in 1850, the Main Shed had twenty five roads. Although {{there was no}} turntable {{in front of the}} main <b>running</b> <b>shed,</b> it was built {{in the shape of a}} shallow curve which gave the shed a unique appearance.|$|E
50|$|St. Rollox {{became the}} largest works, {{and is the}} only one still in {{operation}} today, {{after the collapse of the}} North British Locomotive Company in 1962 and the closure of Cowlairs in 1968. In 2007 Railcare limited, who also own the Wolverton Railway Works site in Milton Keynes, took over operations at St. Rollox, from Alstom, who had originally acquired the works from British Rail Engineering Limited in the wake of the railway privatisation. After a significant refurbishment programme, the site currently operates as a Rolling stock repair and maintenance facility. The former Eastfield <b>Running</b> <b>Sheds</b> are now operated as a maintenance depot by First ScotRail and part of the former Cowlairs carriage sidings is now operated as a signalling and maintenance depot by Network Rail.|$|R
50|$|The South African Class 19B, {{numbered}} in {{the range}} from 1401 to 1414, was a later model of the original Class 19 which had been designed in 1928 under the supervision of Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the SAR from 1922 to 1929. It was virtually identical to the Class 19 apart from the wheelbase of the front bogie which had been increased from 6 ft to 6 ft to improve the clearance between the cylinders and the bogie wheels, since the bogie wheels of predecessors Classes 19 and 19A fouled the cylinder covers on sharp curves. The longer wheelbase bogie also facilitated the removal of cylinder covers at <b>running</b> <b>sheds.</b> Because of this difference, the new engines were designated Class 19B.|$|R
50|$|The Type X-17 {{water tender}} first entered service as tenders to these {{locomotives}}. In effect, since Garratt locomotives had hitherto been considered as tank engines because they carry all their water on board, this arrangement introduced the tank-and-tender Garratt. In spite of initial criticisms and doubts, the unusual arrangement of auxiliary water tenders which had earlier only been {{seen on the}} Kitson-Meyer locomotives of the Cape Government Railways and Central South African Railways of 1903 and 1904 respectively, proved to be very effective and was later repeated upon {{the introduction of the}} Classes GMA and GO Garratts in 1954. On the Class GM, the 1600 imp gal on-board water tank on the front engine unit was only used when the water tender was temporarily disconnected from the engine at <b>running</b> <b>sheds.</b>|$|R
