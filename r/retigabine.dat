40|$|<b>Retigabine</b> {{is a novel}} {{anticonvulsant}} with {{an unknown}} mechanism of action. It has recently been reported that <b>retigabine</b> modulates a potassium channel current in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC 12 cells (Rundfeldt, 1999), however, to date the molecular correlate of this current has not been identified. In the present study we have {{examined the effects of}} <b>retigabine</b> on recombinant human KCNQ 2 and KCNQ 3 potassium channels, expressed either alone or in combination inXenopus oocytes. Application of 10 μM <b>retigabine</b> to oocytes expressing the KCNQ 2 / 3 heteromeric channel shifted both the activation threshold and voltage for half-activation by approximately 20 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction, leading to an increase in current amplitude at test potentials between − 80 mV and + 20 mV. <b>Retigabine</b> also had a marked effect on KCNQ current kinetics, increasing the rate of channel activation but slowing deactivation at a given test potential. Similar effects of <b>retigabine</b> were observed in oocytes expressing KCNQ 2 alone, suggesting that KCNQ 2 may be the molecular target of <b>retigabine.</b> Membrane potential recordings in oocytes expressing the KCNQ 2 / 3 heteromeric channel showed that application of <b>retigabine</b> leads to a concentration-dependent hyperpolarization of the oocyte, from a resting potential of − 63 mV under control conditions to − 85 mV in the presence of 100 μM <b>retigabine</b> (IC 50 = 5. 2 μM). In control experiments <b>retigabine</b> had no effect on either resting membrane potential or endogenous oocyte membrane currents. In conclusion, we have shown that <b>retigabine</b> acts as a KCNQ potassium channel opener. Because the heteromeric KCNQ 2 / 3 channel has recently been reported to underlie the M-current, it is likely that M-current modulation can explain the anticonvulsant actions of <b>retigabine</b> in animal models of epilepsy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Retigabine</b> {{belongs to}} a new {{generation}} of antiepileptic drugs. Its mechanism of action is different from that previously known. <b>Retigabine</b> opens potassium channels of subfamily Kv 7, especially Kv 7. 2 and Kv 7. 3. The drug enhances GABA-ergic transmission. It is well absorbed from the digestive system and undergoes metabolism via glucuronidation and acetylation. There is no interaction between <b>retigabine</b> and other antiepileptic drugs except lamotrigine. The drug has been registered as treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults. The efficacy of <b>retigabine</b> is being tested in other types of seizures and disorders characterized by neuronal hyperexcitability.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <b>Retigabine</b> is a {{recently}} approved anti-epileptic agent which activates Kv 7. 2 - 7. 5 potassium channels. An important role for these channels in vascular regulation is emerging, but the vascular effects of <b>retigabine</b> in the conscious state are unknown. In {{the present study}} the regional haemodynamic responses to <b>retigabine</b> were assessed in conscious rats. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically instrumented with pulsed Doppler flow probes to measure regional haemodynamic responses to <b>retigabine</b> under control conditions and during acute hypertension induced by infusion of angiotensin II (AII) and arginine vasopressin (AVP). Further experiments were performed to elucidate the roles of β-adrenoceptor activation in the responses to <b>retigabine</b> in vivo and in vitro. KEY RESULTS: Under normotensive conditions, <b>retigabine</b> caused dose-dependent hypotension and hindquarters vasodilatation, with small, transient renal and mesenteric vasodilatations. In the acutely hypertensive state, the renal and mesenteric, but not hindquarters, vasodilatations were enhanced. The hindquarters response to <b>retigabine</b> was mediated, in part, by β 2 -adrenoceptors. However, in vitro experiments confirmed that <b>retigabine</b> did not act as a β-adrenoceptor agonist. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results, showing differential vasodilator effects of <b>retigabine,</b> broadly support other studies identifying Kv 7 channels as mediators of vascular tone, highlighting the different responses under normotensive and hypertensive conditions, and a role for β-adrenoceptor activation.

METHODS: Fifteen healthy men received 200 mg of <b>retigabine</b> on day 1. On days 4 – 32, phenobarbitone 90 mg was administered at 22. 00 h. On days 26 – 32, increasing doses of <b>retigabine</b> {{were given to}} achieve a final dose of 200 mg every 8 h on day 32. The pharmacokinetics of <b>retigabine</b> were determined on days 1 and 32, and those for phenobarbitone on days 25 and 31. RESULTS: After administration of a single 200 mg dose, <b>retigabine</b> was rapidly absorbed and eliminated with a mean terminal half-life of 6. 7 h, a mean AUC of 3936 ng ml 1 h and a mean apparent clearance of 0. 76 l h 1 kg 1. Similar exposure to the partially active acetylated metabolite (AWD 21 - 360) of <b>retigabine</b> was observed. After administration of phenobarbitone dosed to steady-state, the pharmacokinetics of <b>retigabine</b> at steady-state were similar (AUC of 4433 ng ml 1 h and t 1 / 2 of 8. 5 h) to those of <b>retigabine</b> alone. The AUC of phenobarbitone was 298 mg l 1 h when administered alone and 311 mg ml 1 h after <b>retigabine</b> administration. The geometric mean ratios and 90 % confidence intervals of the AUC were 1. 11 (0. 97, 1. 28) for <b>retigabine,</b> 1. 01 (0. 88, 1. 06) for AWD 21 - 360 and 1. 04 (0. 96, 1. 11) for phenobarbitone. Individual and combined treatments were generally well tolerated. One subject was withdrawn from the study on day 10 due to severe abdominal pain. Headache was the most commonly reported adverse event. No clinically relevant changes were observed in the electrocardiograms, vital signs or laboratory measurements.

MATERIALS & METHODS: Calculations were performed using a validated decision-tree model. The study population consisted of adult patients with focal-onset epilepsy in published randomized placebo-controlled add-on trials of <b>retigabine</b> or lacosamide. Healthcare utilization and QALY for each treatment alternative were calculated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed using the specification of this model {{as a basis for}} Monte Carlo simulations. 2009 prices were used for all costs. RESULTS: Results were reported for a 2 -year follow-up period. <b>Retigabine</b> add-on treatment was both more effective and less costly than lacosamide add-on treatment, and the cost per additional QALY for the <b>retigabine</b> no add-on (standard) therapy comparison was estimated at 2009 € 15, 753. Using a willingness-to-pay threshold for a QALY of € 50, 000, the net marginal values were estimated at 2009 € 605, 874 for <b>retigabine</b> vs lacosamide and 2009 € 2, 114, 203 for <b>retigabine</b> vs no add-on, per 1, 000 patients. The probabilistic analyses showed that the likelihood that <b>retigabine</b> treatment is cost-effective is at least 70 %. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated cost per additional QALY, for the <b>retigabine</b> vs no add-on treatment comparison, is well within the range of newly published estimates of willingness to pay for an additional QALY.

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{efficacy and}} tolerability of <b>retigabine</b> (ezogabine, US adopted name) in the adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults. <b>Retigabine</b> {{is the first}} anticonvulsant in its class, decreasing neuronal excitability by opening voltage-gated potassium channels. Methods MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched using search terms <b>retigabine</b> and ezogabine for randomized controlled trials published from 1980 through August 17, 2013. Additionally, articles relating to pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, tolerability and interactions were examined for inclusion. Published abstracts and websites of the Food and Drug Administration and European Medication Agency were reviewed for additional relevant information. Results One phase IIb and two phase III trials were identified. <b>Retigabine</b> {{has been reported to}} have dose dependent efficacy in adjunctive treatment of resistant partial-onset seizures in adults in doses of 600, 900 and 1200 mg/day. Similar to other anticonvulsants, the most common adverse events were central nervous system related. <b>Retigabine</b> has several unique adverse events compared to other anticonvulsants: urinary retention and, with extended use, pigment changes to the skin and retina. <b>Retigabine</b> is metabolized by glucuronidation and acetylation. There are few drug interactions with <b>retigabine.</b> Conclusions <b>Retigabine</b> has been shown to have efficacy when used as adjunctive therapy in partial-onset seizures. It has a novel mechanism of action, activation of voltage-gated potassium channels. It has less drug interactions than many other anticonvulsants because it is not metabolized through the P- 450 system.

40|$|Homo- and heteromeric {{complexes}} of KCNQ channel subunits are {{the molecular}} correlate of the M-current, a neuron-specific voltage-dependent K+ current with a well established role {{in control of}} neural excitability. We investigated the effect of KCNQ channel modulators on the activity of dopaminergic neurons in vitro and in vivo in the rat ventral mesencephalon. The firing of dopaminergic neurons recorded in mesencephalic slices was robustly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the KCNQ channel opener N-(2 -amino- 4 -(4 -fluorobenzylamino) phenyl) carbamic acid ethyl ester (<b>retigabine).</b> The effect of <b>retigabine</b> persisted {{in the presence of}} tetrodotoxin and simultaneous blockade of GABA A receptors, small-conductance calcium-activated K+ (SK) channels, and hyperpolarization-activated (I-h) channels, and it was potently reversed by the KCNQ channel blocker 4 - pyridinylmethyl- 9 (10 H) -anthracenone (XE 991), indicating a direct effect on KCNQ channels. Likewise, in vivo single unit recordings from dopaminergic neurons revealed a prominent reduction in spike activity after systemic administration of <b>retigabine.</b> Furthermore, <b>retigabine</b> inhibited dopamine synthesis and c-Fos expression in the striatum under basal conditions. <b>Retigabine</b> completely blocked the excitatory effect of dopamine D- 2 auto-receptor antagonists. Again, the in vitro and in vivo effects of <b>retigabine</b> were completely reversed by preadministration of XE 991. Dual immunocytochemistry revealed that KCNQ 4 is the major KCNQ channel subunit expressed in all dopaminergic neurons in the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal pathways.

40|$|Background. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) {{decrease}} {{the occurrence of}} epileptic seizures and modulate cortical excitability through several mechanisms that likely interact. The modulation of brain excitability by AEDs is believed to reflect their antiepileptic action(s) and {{could be used as}} a surrogate marker of their efficacy. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is one of the best noninvasive methods to study cortical excitability in human subjects. Specific TMS parameters can be used to quantify the various mechanisms of action of AEDs. A new AED called <b>retigabine</b> increases potassium efflux by changing the conformation of KCNQ 2 - 5 potassium channels, which leads to neuronal hyperpolarisation and a decrease in excitability. Hypothesis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of <b>retigabine</b> on cortical excitability. Based on the known mechanisms of action of <b>retigabine,</b> we hypothesized that the oral intake of <b>retigabine</b> would increase the resting motor threshold (RMT). Methods. Fifteen healthy individuals participated in a placebocontrolled,double-blind, randomised, clinical trial (RCT). The primary outcome measure was the RMT quantified before and after oral intake of <b>retigabine.</b> Several secondary TMS outcome measures were acquired. Results. The mean RMT, active motor threshold (AMT) and intensity to obtain a 1 mV peak-to-peak amplitude potential (SI 1 mV) were significantly increased after <b>retigabine</b> intake compared to placebo (RMT: P = 0. 039; AMT: P = 0. 014; SI 1 mV: P = 0. 019). No significant differences were found for short-interval intracortical inhibition/intracortical facilitation (SICI/ICF), long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) or shortinterval intracortical facilitation (SICF).

40|$|Abstract Background Temporomandibular {{disorders}} (TMDs) {{are characterized}} by persistent orofacial pain and have diverse etiologic factors that are not well understood. It is thought that central sensitization leads to neuronal hyperexcitability and contributes to hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are currently {{the first choice of}} drug to relieve TMD pain. NSAIDS were shown to exhibit anticonvulsant properties and suppress cortical neuron activities by enhancing neuronal voltage-gated potassium KCNQ/Kv 7 channels (M-current), suggesting that specific activation of M-current might be beneficial for TMD pain. Results In this study, we selected a new anticonvulsant drug <b>retigabine</b> that specifically activates M-current, and investigated the effect of <b>retigabine</b> on inflammation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in rats. The results show that the head withdrawal threshold for escape from mechanical stimulation applied to facial skin over the TMJ in inflamed rats was significantly lower than that in control rats. Administration of centrally acting M-channel opener <b>retigabine</b> (2. 5 and 7. 5 mg/kg) can dose-dependently raise the head withdrawal threshold of mechanical allodynia, and this analgesic effect can be reversed by the specific KCNQ channel blocker XE 991 (3 mg/kg). Food intake is known to be negatively associated with TMJ inflammation. Food intake was increased significantly by the administration of <b>retigabine</b> (2. 5 and 7. 5 mg/kg), and this effect was reversed by XE 991 (3 mg/kg). Furthermore, intracerebralventricular injection of <b>retigabine</b> further confirmed the analgesic effect of central <b>retigabine</b> on inflammatory TMJ. Conclusions Our findings indicate that central sensitization is involved in inflammatory TMJ pain and pharmacological intervention for controlling central hyperexcitability by activation of neuronal KCNQ/M-channels may have therapeutic potential for TMDs. </p...|$|E

Since Kv 7 potassium channels regulate dopamine release, we investigated the effects of their pharmacological modulation on dopamine efflux, measured by fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV), and neurotoxicity, in Wistar rat caudate brain slices undergoing oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). The Kv 7 activators <b>retigabine</b> and ICA 27243 delayed the onset, and decreased the peak level of dopamine efflux induced by OGD; and also decreased OGD-induced damage measured by 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. <b>Retigabine</b> also reduced OGD-induced necrotic cell death evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase activity assay.

40|$|<b>Retigabine</b> and {{flupirtine}} are two structurally related molecules provided of anticonvulsant and analgesic actions. The {{present study}} has investigated the neuroprotective potential, {{as well as}} the possible underlying molecular mechanisms, exerted by <b>retigabine</b> and flupirtine in rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) exposed to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD), or serum withdrawal (SW). Region-specific vulnerability of hippocampal subfields occurred with each of these injury models. Specifically, CA 1 was the most susceptible region to both NMDA and OGD-induced neurodegeneration, whereas selective cell death in the dentate gyrus (DG) occurred upon OHSCs exposure to SW. The NMDA antagonist MK- 801 (10 - 30 microM), despite blocking NMDA- and OGD-induced cell death, failed to prevent SW-induced neurodegeneration. Interestingly, <b>retigabine</b> (0. 01 - 10 microM) and flupirtine (0. 01 - 10 microM) dose-dependently prevented DG neuronal death induced by SW, with IC 50 s of 0. 4 microM and 0. 7 microM, respectively.

40|$|Background Dyspigmentation of {{the oral}} mucosa has a {{multitude}} of aetiological causes. <b>Retigabine,</b> a new antiepileptic drug, has the potential side effect of inducing a blue/purple pigmentation {{of the oral}} mucosa {{in addition to the}} skin, lips, nails and retina of the eyes. This article presents a unique case of dyspigmentation present in the oral mucosa of the hard palate which has previously been unreported in the dental literature. Case presentation A 70 year old white male presented to a secondary care oral surgery department with an unusual asymptomatic pigmented lesion present in the hard palate of the oral cavity. The pigmentation was remarkable for its distinct blue/purple colouration which was associated with a similar discolouration of the nail beds of the hands. This is believed to be a side effect of the anti-epileptic medication <b>retigabine.</b> Conclusion The dental profession and wider healthcare community should be made fully aware of the potential side effect of oral dyspigmentation associated with the novel anti-epileptic medication <b>retigabine.</b> Enhanced knowledge of the causative role of <b>retigabine</b> in dyspigementation of the oral mucosa will allow the practitioner to make an appropriate diagnosis. As far the authors are aware this is reaction is unreported in the dental literature and should be disseminated to the wider oral health professional’s community...|$|E
40|$|Heteromeric KCNQ 5 /Q 3 {{channels}} were stably {{expressed in}} Chinese Hamster ovary cells and characterized using the whole cell voltage-clamp technique. KCNQ 5 /Q 3 channels were activated by the novel anticonvulsant, <b>retigabine</b> (EC 50 1. 4 [*]μM) by a mechanism that involved drug-induced, leftward {{shifts in the}} voltage-dependence of channel activation (− 31. 8 [*]mV by 30 [*]μM <b>retigabine).</b> KCNQ 5 /Q 3 channels were inhibited by linopirdine (IC 50 7. 7 [*]μM) and barium (IC 50 0. 46 [*]mM), at concentrations similar to those required to inhibit native M-currents. These findings identify KCNQ 5 /Q 3 channels as a molecular target for <b>retigabine</b> and raise the possibility that activation of KCNQ 5 /Q 3 channels {{may be responsible for}} some of the anti-convulsant activity of this agent. Furthermore, the sensitivity of KCNQ 5 /Q 3 channels to linopirdine supports the possibility that potassium channels comprised of KCNQ 5 and KCNQ 3 may make a contribution to native M-currents...|$|E
40|$|<b>Retigabine</b> is an {{anticonvulsant}} drug indicated as adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in adults. It exerts its anticonvulsant action by reducing neuronal excitability through activation of type 7 voltage-dependent K + (K V 7) channels encoded by the KCNQ genes (Rundfeldt et al., 2000). These channels include 5 subtypes (K V 7. 1 - 7. 5) and play {{important roles in}} regulating the membrane potential of various cell types, including cardiomyocytes and neurons (by activating K V 7. 1 homomers and K V 7. 2 / 7. 3 and K V 7. 3 / 7. 5 heteromers, respectively) (Soldovieri et al., 2011). K V 7 channels also regulate smooth muscle activity in different systems (Greenwood and Ohya, 2009). The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the motor effects of <b>retigabine</b> in the human bladder detrusor. Specimens of detrusor were obtained from patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee and all patients signed an informed consent. Muscle strips prepared from the detrusor were suspended under isotonic conditions (9. 8 -mN load) in Krebs solution maintained at 37 ° C and bubbled with carbogen inside 5 -ml organ baths. <b>Retigabine</b> (1 - 100 μM) induced concentration-dependent relaxations of bethanechol (5 μM) -precontracted strips. The maximal relaxation induced by <b>retigabine</b> (100 μM) was 51. 8 ± 5. 3...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of KCNQ (potassium channel, voltage-gated, KQT-like subfamily) openers in preventing myotonia caused by anthracene- 9 -carboxylic acid (9 -AC, a chloride channel blocker). An animal model of myotonia can be elicited in murine skeletal muscle by 9 -AC treatment. KCNQ openers, such as <b>retigabine</b> and flupirtine, can inhibit the increased twitch amplitude (0. 1 [*]Hz stimulation) and reduce the tetanic fade (20 [*]Hz stimulations) observed in the presence of 9 -AC. Furthermore, the prolonged twitch duration of skeletal muscle was also inhibited by <b>retigabine</b> or flupirtine. Lamotrigine (an anticonvulsant drug) has a lesser effect on the muscle twitch amplitude, tetanic fade, and prolonged twitch duration as compared with KCNQ openers. In experiments using intracellular recordings, <b>retigabine</b> and flupirtine clearly reduced the firing frequencies of repetitive action potentials induced by 9 -AC. These data suggested that KCNQ openers prevent the myotonia induced by 9 -AC, at least partly through enhancing potassium conductance in skeletal muscle. Taken together, these results indicate that KCNQ openers are potential alternative therapeutic agents for the treatment of myotonia...|$|E
