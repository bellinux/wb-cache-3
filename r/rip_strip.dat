40|$|In {{order to}} place {{instruments}} for measuring meteorological and electrical parameters into thunderstorms, an inexpensive apparatus {{has been developed}} which {{makes it possible to}} inflate, transport, and launch balloons in high winds. The launching apparatus is a cylinder of bubble plastic that is made by joining the sides of the cylinder together with a velcro <b>rip</b> <b>strip.</b> A balloon is launched by pulling the <b>rip</b> <b>strip</b> rapidly. This allows the balloon to pop upward into the ambient low-level wind and carry its instrumentation aloft. Different-sized launch tubes are constructed to accommodate particular sizes of balloons. Balloons have been launched in winds of about 20 m/s...|$|E
5000|$|Together {{with his}} brother Henrik Maarud (drums), he started the band «MaarudKara» {{at the age of}} six. The band came second in the Talentiaden (1997) on NRK, and {{released}} the album First Blues the year after. In 2000 he started his solo career backed by his band A. M. Band, still {{with his brother}} drummer and with blues in their repertoire. The band released two albums <b>Ripped,</b> <b>Stripped</b> & Southern Fried (2003) and Commotion (2004), and was nominated for the Spellemannprisen 2003 in the class Blues/country for the debut album <b>Ripped,</b> <b>Stripped</b> & Southern Fried. In 2006 he initiated the bandet The Grand, with the same lineup as A. M. Band, but had a more rocky and psychedelic expression. The band released the album The Grand (2007). The band is currently on rest for an indefinite period of time.|$|R
5000|$|Together {{with his}} brother Amund, he started the 'MaarudKara' as a four-year-old, where their father was backing on bass in {{addition}} to the Simen Aanerud (known as Simon Taylor) on piano. Initially the repertoire consisted of pop music, but eventually they converted to blues music. The band was second in [...] "Talentiaden" [...] at NRK in 1997, and released the album First Blues (1999). In 2000 Amund focused on solo career with Henry as the drummer within the 'Amund Maarud Band'. They released the album <b>Ripped,</b> <b>Stripped</b> and Southern Fried (2003), and was nominated for Spellemannprisen 2003, in the category Blues.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to {{his work in the}} comic book field, Herron wrote syndicated newspaper comic strips for Columbia Features. Beginning in 1955, he wrote the daily strips Davy Crockett, Frontiersman and Nero Wolfe — staying on the Davy Crocket strip until 1959, when he became the writer of the Bat Masterson and <b>Rip</b> Tide <b>strips,</b> which he wrote until his death in 1966.|$|R

5000|$|Charlton Comics and DC Comics editor Dick Giordano felt that, [...] "If {{you take}} a close look at Vince's inking style, you'll find it bears a close {{resemblance}} to Alex Raymond's style on Rip Kirby; that was very popular at that time. ... Vince used to have these <b>Rip</b> Kirby <b>strips</b> in front of him, looking at them while he was inking. But what he was inking had nothing to do with the strip he was looking at. I don't know what he got out of it except inspiration".|$|R

60|$|He went {{round the}} wheat and oats, and then spent several days <b>ripping</b> odd <b>strips</b> {{here and there}} across the prairie in the track of the {{prevalent}} winds. It was fiercely hot weather, but he was busy every hour from dawn to dusk, and at nights his men grinned as they mentioned it. Charley Leland was getting very afraid of fire, they said. When he was satisfied with the ploughing, he had the axes and grub-hoes ground, and set the men to work cutting out the smaller growth of willows of underbrush in the strip of birches that stretched close up to the homestead from the bluff. When Gallwey, who had other duties, found him busy at it the first morning, he smiled a little.|$|R
25|$|Many {{standard}} {{shop and}} woodworking tools {{may be used}} in the process of creating or maintaining deadwood on bonsai. Pliers are used to grip and break off branches for jin, and are also useful for <b>ripping</b> off <b>strips</b> of bark for jin or shari. Manual tools like graving chisels, burins, and blades can carve detail into the surface of the jins or shari, since real or simulated woodgrain is an important characteristic of deadwood on a bonsai. Recent years have seen bonsai practitioners adopt powered tools for deadwood work, particularly small rotary tools for carving and grinding. When shaping is completed, a gas torch burns off remaining small shreds of wood fiber and helps raise the grain in a newly exposed piece of wood. Finally, wire brushes and sanding aids remove toolmarks and simulate weathering.|$|R
60|$|The beast {{seemed to}} {{understand}} that this man was different from the banderilleros who had previously tormented it, and backed away from him until he smote it lightly on the nostrils. Then it swept forward in a savage rush but though the man's movements were so quick that one scarcely noticed them, he was not quite where he had been a moment earlier, when the bull thundered past him. Still, one horn had <b>ripped</b> a <b>strip</b> of silk from him. He followed the beast, and struck it with his hand, and for five or six frenzied minutes the vast audience roared. This man never ran. He stepped backwards, or twisted, always with grave gracefulness, in the nick of time, until at last the bull stood still, as though stupefied with rage or uncertain how to attack its elusive persecutor.|$|R
60|$|When he {{had washed}} the wound he fetched some table linen from a press and <b>ripped</b> it into <b>strips</b> with his dagger; he {{threaded}} {{out one of}} these and made a preliminary crisscross of the threads across the lips of the wound--for the blade had gone right through {{the muscles of the}} breast, grazing the ribs; these threads would help the formation of a clot. Then with the infinite skill and cunning acquired {{in the course of his}} rovings he proceeded to the bandaging.|$|R
5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to <b>rip</b> off <b>strips,</b> always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|R
50|$|Abbots Ripton ends in ton {{which usually}} {{indicates}} a Saxon origin. The {{origin of the}} place-name is from the Old English words <b>rip</b> (a <b>strip</b> of land) andtun (homestead or farm). Its name has appeared in various guises throughout its history; it was recorded as Riptone in the 10th century and Riptune in 1086. It was during the 12th and 13th century that the Abbot part came into the name; it was then owned by the Abbot of Ramsey, and it was most probably just to distinguish it from Kings Ripton which was under royal ownership. During this period it was also known by the names of Magna Riptona, Ryptone and finally Riptone Abbatis. After the Reformation the crown sold it to the St John family {{and for a time}} it was called St John's Ripton before it became known by the name we know it today.|$|R

6000|$|... "These small boards Pat and I {{are making}} are for muskrats in the spring. For marten, mink, otter, fisher and such like we use longer, {{narrower}} boards; that is, they are narrower {{in proportion to}} their length. I'll show you some presently. The best boards are those with a narrow <b>strip</b> <b>ripped</b> {{out of the middle}} for the whole length. This makes a wedge or tongue. Of course it should be tapered. This makes it possible to use the board for various size animals and to stretch the skin to its fullest extent. It also makes it easy to remove a skin from the board, as taking out the wedge at once loosens the whole board.|$|R
5000|$|By 1973, Morrow {{had served}} as an uncredited ghost artist or art {{assistant}} on the syndicated comic <b>strips</b> <b>Rip</b> Kirby by John Prentice, Secret Agent X-9 by Al Williamson and Big Ben Bolt by John Cullen Murphy.

40|$|The most {{frequently}} used condition for sampling matrices employed in compressive sampling is the restricted isometry (RIP) property of the matrix when restricted to sparse signals. At the same time, imposing this condition {{makes it difficult to}} find explicit matrices that support recovery of signals from sketches of the optimal (smallest possible) dimension. A number of {{attempts have been made to}} relax or replace the RIP property in sparse recovery algorithms. We focus on the relaxation under which the near-isometry property holds for most rather than for all submatrices of the sampling matrix, known as statistical <b>RIP</b> or <b>StRIP</b> condition. We show that sampling matrices of dimensions $m\times N$ with maximum coherence $\mu=O((k\log^ 3 N) ^{- 1 / 4 }) $ and mean square coherence $\bar \mu^ 2 =O(1 /(k\log N)) $ support stable recovery of $k$-sparse signals using Basis Pursuit. These assumptions are satisfied in many examples. As a result, we are able to construct sampling matrices that support recovery with low error for sparsity $k$ higher than $\sqrt m,$ which exceeds the range of parameters of the known classes of RIP matrices...|$|R

About the same time Austen wrote and drew the semi-autobiographical black-and-white pornographic comic book series <b>Strips</b> (<b>Rip</b> Off Press), as well as Hardball (Malibu Comics). In the late 1980s, Austen drew the first five issues for the short-lived series Hero Sandwich by Slave Labor Graphics. He also was involved in the lesser-known Dr. Radium and Lee Flea series, and slowly crossed over into DC Comics when he was assigned to Phantom Lady and Green Flame and drew Disney's The Little Mermaid limited series.|$|R

50|$|Gaffer tape is {{manufactured}} in many colors, including fluorescent and custom colors, {{but perhaps the}} most common variety is matte black. A matte finish keeps the tape from reflecting light so it blends in with a typical stage floor. It is sold in a variety of widths from 1/4 in to 4 in, with 1 in and 2 in being the most common. Gaffer tape is strong yet can be torn by hand, so no cutting tools are necessary, and it can easily be <b>ripped</b> into narrower <b>strips</b> when desired. The synthetic adhesive typically leaves little or no residue and will generally not damage most surfaces when it is removed. This is, however, more likely in warm conditions, so care must be used in considering whether a different type of tape would be more appropriate in a given application. Gaffer tape is usually more expensive than duct tape because it is {{manufactured in}} smaller quantities, has more exacting specifications, and is marketed for professional use.|$|R
