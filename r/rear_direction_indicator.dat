25|$|Two basic {{models were}} built: 410 (1964–1965) with a {{combination}} rear lamp set consisting of round and rectangular lenses, and 411 (1965–1967), which featured the same combination rear lamp set as the earlier 410 through 1966, changing to higher mounted rectangular tail light sets for 1967. On both, the <b>rear</b> <b>direction</b> <b>indicators</b> were red or amber, according to market – New Zealand, which allows either, took the 410 with both and the 411 with red only. This Bluebird {{was one of the}} first Japanese car lines assembled in New Zealand, initially imported under a tariff/duty arrangement allowing 300 cars a year (the so-called '300 Club') with CKD kits built up by Motor Holdings at Mount Wellington in Auckland. The 410 series sedan and station wagon plus a light delivery van was assembled in South Africa at a factory in Rosslyn Pretoria. These cars were all in CKD format.|$|R

40|$|Summary There is {{some concern}} that vehicle <b>direction</b> <b>indicator</b> lamps with clear outer lenses make it {{difficult}} in bright, sunny conditions {{to decide whether the}} signal is on or not. This study photo-metrically evaluated, under bright, sunny conditions, both luminance contrast and colour contrast between the on and off states for <b>direction</b> <b>indicator</b> lamps that use either an amber lens or a dear lens. The results indicate that luminance contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using an amber lens. On the other hand, the results indicate that colour contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using a clear lens. Because luminance contrast {{is likely to be the}} primary variable influencing driver performance, these results suggest that using clear-lens <b>direction</b> <b>indicators</b> is likely to make it more difficult to determine, in bright, sunny conditions, whether the signal is on or not. However, the magnitude of the decrement in real-world performance with dear-lens signal lamps remains to be ascertained. ...|$|R
