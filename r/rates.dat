Information from IMF country reports and other sources, including exchange <b>rate</b> data, is utilized to determine de facto exchange <b>rate</b> policies. Countries are categorized {{based on these}} policies using the IMF nomenclature adopted in 1999. This approach ensures the forward compatibility of the database. The database is then used to examine whether the "bipolar view" of exchange regimes holds with de facto regimes. It is found {{that the proportion of}} countries adopting "intermediate" regimes has indeed been shrinking in favor of greater flexibility or greater fixity, especially for countries more integrated with international markets. Analyses based on Markov chains of regime transitions, however, provide (mixed) evidence against the bipolar view.

The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted the view that monetary policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest <b>rates</b> had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal <b>rates</b> and neglected the role inflation plays in real interest <b>rates,</b> which had been high {{during much of the}} Depression.

5|$|Assessments of {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing <b>rates</b> vary between populations. Populations in {{relatively}} intact bushland have high outcrossing <b>rates,</b> but those in more disturbed environments are both more inbred on average, and more variable. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater <b>rates</b> of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon occasional visitors for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination <b>rates</b> means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations; and the sporadic presence of pollinators leads to outcrossing variability.|$|E
