As {{the center of gravity}} and bumper heights of SUV’s and light trucks increased, pre-1990 guardrails that based their designs on low bumper height vehicles were no longer sufficient. Larger vehicles began to exhibit a tendency to rollover, vault, or rupture guardrails. Sicking led his team to develop a guardrail system that addressed the needs of all vehicle, increasing the <b>rail</b> <b>mounting</b> height, moving rail splices from the posts to the midspan, and increasing blockout depth by four inches.

25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, most armies were fielding light anti-tank guns firing 3.7cm (37mm) ammunition. The guns were usually mounted on two-wheeled carriages {{so they could be}} towed into position, then withdrawn and repositioned rapidly. Since they weighed only a few hundred pounds on average, they could also be manhandled into position. All fired high-explosive and solid armor-piercing shot effective at relatively medium range, and an increasing number were manufactured with protective gun shields in addition to a split <b>rail</b> <b>mounting.</b> They were able to destroy tanks fielded by both sides during {{the first two years of}} the war, but soon proved impotent against the heavier tank armor which debuted in 1940. Introducing improved ammunition and increasing muzzle velocity initially helped compensate for their mediocre performance, but it was clear that small caliber anti-tank guns would soon be overtaken by yet more heavily armored tanks. Medium caliber guns in the 40mm to 50mm range began to appear, some of which simply utilised rebored 37mm barrels. Although they too were soon approaching obsolescence, most remained in use with infantry units until the end of the war. Anti-tank guns remained ineffective against sloped armor, as demonstrated by an incident in 1941 when a single Soviet T-34 tank was impacted over thirty times by a battalion-sized contingent of German 37mm and 50mm anti-tank guns. The tank survived intact and was driven back to its own lines a few hours later. This helped earn the Pak 36 the moniker of Panzeranklopfgerät ("tank door knocker") because its crew simply revealed their presence and wasted their shells without damaging the T-34's armor. Anti-tank gunners began aiming at tank tracks, or vulnerable margins on the turret ring and gun mantlet, rather than testing their lighter cannon against bow and turret armor. These difficulties resulted in new types of ammunition being issued, namely high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) and armor-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) projectiles.|$|E

5000|$|For {{some models}} the option exists to have {{mounting}} rails underneath the riflescope {{to provide for}} mounting solutions that do not use scope rings.

The more recent propriety systems mainly offer aesthetic advantages {{for people who have}} problems with redundant drill holes in sight in case the riflescope is used on different guns. To avoid drilling the scope rail, the propriety <b>rail</b> <b>mounting</b> systems have special shape connections machined in the inside of the rail. These shape connections prevent ever showing any exterior damage from mounting work on the rifle scope. The propriety rail systems use matching slide-in mount fasteners to connect the riflescope to the gun.

40|$|A {{dual band}} thermal/visible weapon sight (TVWS) {{prototype}} {{was developed by}} INO in collaboration with DRDC Valcartier. The TVWS operates in the 8 - 12 µm infrared (IR) and 300 - 900 nm visible wavebands for enhanced vision capabilities in day and night operations. It is equipped with lightweight athermalized coaxial catadioptric objectives, a bolometric IR imager operating in a microscan mode providing an effective resolution of 320 x 240 pixels and a visible image intensifier of 768 x 493 pixels. The TVWS {{is equipped with a}} miniature shutter for automatic offset calibration. Real-time imaging at 30 fps is available. Both the visible and IR images can be toggled with a single touch button and displayed on an integrated color micro liquid crystal display (LCD). The TVWS also has a standard video output via a coaxial connector. An integrated wireless analog RF link can be used to send images to a remote command control. The sight has an adjustable electronic crosshair and two manual focuses from 25 m to infinity. On-board processing capabilities were added to introduce specific functionalities such as image polarity inversion (black hot/white hot) and image enhancement. This TVWS model is also very lightweight (~ 1900 grams) and compact (volume of 142 cubic inches). It offers human size target detection at 800 m and recognition at 200 m (Johnson criteria) with the IR waveband while offering the human recognition at up to 800 m with the visible waveband. The TVWS is adapted for weaver or Picatinny <b>rail</b> <b>mounting...</b>|$|E
40|$|W-beam {{guardrails}} {{are by far}} {{the most}} common restraint system used along both local and major roadways. Traditionally, these restraint systems have been full-scale crash tested with a rail height ranging between 27 in. and 32 in. However, the maximum rail height which allows for safe performance of guardrails, especially in impacts involving small vehicles, has never been identified. The main concern associated with an increase of the rail height is that small vehicles, because of their low profile, may have a tendency to lift the rail and penetrate the barrier. The objective of this project was to determine the critical rail height at which small vehicles start under-riding the barrier. A potential increase of the rail location could provide several benefits in terms of an improved safety of the system with vehicles characterized by a high center of mass, economic advantages related to the maintenance of the roadside, and accommodation of potential frost-heave and erosion. This study used computer simulations to investigate the safety of the Midwest Guardrail System (MGS) with the rail located higher than 32 in. from the ground level, considering various impact angles and grading scenarios ranging from flat terrain to minor slopes. Also, the potential problems and the influences of different frontal geometry of vehicles were considered. With consideration given to current small car design trends, this study showed that on level terrain the MGS would satisfy MASH TL- 3 evaluation criteria with rail heights up to 36 in. Furthermore, it was shown that successful containment of errant cars and trucks may be achieved on 6 : 1 approach slopes when the rail is mounted at 36 in., and improved pickup truck redirection was shown on 8 : 1 approach slopes with increased <b>rail</b> <b>mounting</b> height. Full-scale vehicle crash tests are necessary to confirm these simulation results before these taller systems can be deemed crashworthy according to MASH and implemented. Advisor: John D. Rei...|$|E
