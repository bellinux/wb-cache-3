At the same time, the coating is expected to both preserve the aesthetic appeal of the artefact and be <b>retreatable.</b> Common protective coatings used in conservation practice are paraffin and microcrystalline waxes [1]. These coatings are applied physically to a surface. Inhibitive coatings on the other hand form a protective layer on a surface after a chemical reaction.|$|E

The coatings were characterized with optical and electron microscopy and electrochemical tests were performed to compare the corrosion currents before and after the application of the coating on standard copper coupons. Preliminary results suggest that treatment of copper with carboxylic acid solutions in ethanol with more than 10 carbon atoms, and pH 7 â€“ 7. 5, improves the corrosion resistance of copper. Nevertheless, the use of ethanolic solutions of carboxylic acids is not suitable for use on cultural heritage material because of the irreproducibility of the results and the blue color of the copper carboxylate...|$|E
40|$|A vehicle {{space where}} {{vehicles}} move around is structured {{in a space}} tree whose nodes are space objects. Higher-level objects denote broader area than lower level ones. Each vehicle first decides a broad path which includes higher-level objects, and the path is made more detailed as the vehicle is approaching to the destination. Vehicles are modeled as transactions which hold objects. There are kinds of vehicles, on three points, removable, stoppable, and <b>retreatable.</b> In this paper, we discuss three schemes, i. e. close, semi-open, and open ones for locking and releasing objects with respect to types of vehicles. 1 Introduction A vehicle system is composed of vehicles which move around in a vehicle space. [1] discusses a broad path decision where each vehicle v first decides the broad path to the destination, and then the path is more detailed as v is approaching to the destination. The space is structured in a tree whose nodes are objects. Children of an object o are component one [...] ...|$|E
