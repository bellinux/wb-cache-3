40|$|Problem The pIgR mediates {{transport}} of IgA into the lumen of mucosal tissues preventing pathogenic infection. Despite this, {{the expression of}} pIgR during chlamydial infections of {{the male and female}} <b>reproductive</b> <b>tracts</b> remains poorly understood. Method of study The expression of pIgR in response to hormone cycling or over the course of chlamydial infection was determined in vitro and in vivo by Western blot or immunohistochemistry. Results PIgR was upregulated in response to Chlamydia spp. infection of human epithelia, in both male and female mouse <b>reproductive</b> <b>tracts.</b> PIgR expression was found to be highest during estrus in the cervicovaginal and uterine epithelia and lowest during diestrus or following hormonal synchronization with Depo-Provera. Chlamydial infection of mice mediates upregulation of pIgR and transcytosis of IgA into the lumen. Conclusions Our results suggest that chlamydial infection enhances IgA secretion and pIgR expression by epithelia in the lower <b>reproductive</b> <b>tracts</b> of females and males, and hormone synchronization downregulates pIgR expression and transcytosis of IgA prior to challenge...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{fertilization}} requires {{viable and}} functional spermatozoa {{to recognize and}} fuse with the oocyte. In most mammalian species, mature spermatozoa are not capable of fertilizing the oocytes immediately after ejaculation. However, unlike somatic cells, spermatozoa, after leaving the testis, are transcriptionally and translationally silent; therefore, upon completion of spermiogenesis, spermatozoa carry only a minimal amount of essential proteins on their membranes as well as within their restricted volume of cytoplasm. To develop into a fully functional and competent sperm {{that is capable of}} successful fertilization, modifications of the sperm membrane surface during its transit in the <b>reproductive</b> <b>tracts</b> is critical. These post-spermatogenesis modifications advance the maturation of epididymal spermatozoa. In addition, components secreted into the lumen of the <b>reproductive</b> <b>tracts</b> that are later added onto the sperm membrane surface also regulate (inhibit or activate) the functions of the spermatozoa. This acquisition of additional proteins from the <b>reproductive</b> <b>tracts</b> may compensate for the inactivity of morphologically mature spermatozoa. In this review, we discuss the contributions of the male and female genital tracts to modifications of the sperm membrane surface at different stages of fertilization...|$|R
5|$|As {{the number}} of known {{specimens}} increased, scientists began to analyze the variation between individuals and discovered {{what appeared to be}} two distinct body types, or morphs, similar to some other theropod species. As one of these morphs was more solidly built, it was termed the 'robust' morph while the other was termed ''. Several morphological differences associated with the two morphs were used to analyze sexual dimorphism in Tyrannosaurus rex, with the 'robust' morph usually suggested to be female. For example, the pelvis of several 'robust' specimens seemed to be wider, perhaps to allow the passage of eggs. It was also thought that the 'robust' morphology correlated with a reduced chevron on the first tail vertebra, also ostensibly to allow eggs to pass out of the <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract,</b> as had been erroneously reported for crocodiles.|$|E
5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract</b> such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} many {{hypotheses}} that have attempted to explain why lemurs exhibit female social dominance while other primates with similar social structures do not, but no consensus has been reached after decades of research. The dominant view in the literature states that female dominance is an advantageous trait given {{the high costs of}} reproduction and the scarcity of resources available. Indeed, female dominance {{has been shown to be}} linked to increased maternal investment. However, when reproductive costs and extreme seasonality of resources were compared across primates, other primates demonstrated male dominance under conditions that were similar to or more challenging than those faced by lemurs. In 2008, a new hypothesis revised this model using simple game theory. It was argued that when two individuals were equally matched in fighting capacity, the one with the most need would win the conflict since it would have the most to lose. Consequently, the female, with higher resource needs for pregnancy, lactation, and maternal care, was more likely to win in resource conflicts with equally sized males. This, however, assumed monomorphism between sexes. The following year, a new hypothesis was proposed to explain monomorphism, stating that because most female lemurs are only sexually receptive for a day or two each year, males can utilize a more passive form of mate guarding: copulatory plugs, which block the female <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract,</b> preventing other males from successfully mating with her, and thus reducing the need for aggression and the evolutionary drive for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
40|$|In normal {{estrogen}} target tissues, estrogen {{action is}} mediated through a specific nuclear transcription factor, the estrogen receptor (ER). The site of estrogen {{action in the}} developing organism is therefore determined by cells that contain ER and other necessary tissue and gene-specific components for estrogen-mediated transcription. Immunocytochemical methods {{were used to determine}} the cellular localization and tissue distribution of ERs in <b>reproductive</b> <b>tracts</b> of mouse fetuses. Nuclear staining for ER was observed in <b>reproductive</b> <b>tracts</b> at fetal days 13 to 15. ERs were present in the precursors of both male and female <b>reproductive</b> <b>tracts</b> at these early developmental stages, which may be attributable to their similar embryonic origins. However, as the tissues undergo sexual differentiation at later fetal and early neonatal ages, ER increases in the female <b>reproductive</b> <b>tracts</b> as compared with the male. ER was detected by immunoblotting on fetal day 10 (before sexual differentiation) in extracts of whole mouse embryos. To determine whether ER and progesterone receptor genes are expressed earlier in development, we examined RNA from preimplantation mouse embryos using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction techniques. ER mRNA was found in oocytes and fertilized eggs. Message concentration declined at the 2 -cell stage and reached its lowest level at the 5 - to 8 -cell stage. ER mRNA was not detectable at the morula stage but reappeared at the blastocyst stage. Progesterone receptor mRNA was not detectable until the blastocyst stage. The embryonic expression of ER and progesterone receptor genes in the blastocyst suggests a possible functional requirement for estrogen and progesterone receptors in preimplantation embryos. - Environ Health Perspect 1 03 (Suppl 7) : 69 - 72 (1995) Key words: estrogen, estrogen receptors, diethylstilbestrol, embryogenesi...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHox genes show related {{sequences}} and overlapping expression domains {{that often}} reflect functional redundancy {{as well as}} a common evolutionary origin. To accurately define their functions, it has become necessary to compare phenotypes of mice with single and multiple Hox gene mutations. Here, we focus on two Abd-B-type genes, Hoxa- 10 and Hoxa- 11, which are coexpressed in developing vertebrae, limbs, and <b>reproductive</b> <b>tracts.</b> To assess possible functional redundancy between these two genes, Hoxa- 10 /Hoxa- 11 transheterozygotes were produced by genetic intercrosses and analyzed. This compound mutation resulted in synergistic defects in transheterozygous limbs and <b>reproductive</b> <b>tracts,</b> but not in vertebrae. In the forelimb, distal radial/ulnar thickening and pisiform/triangular carpal fusion were observed in 35 and 21 % of transheterozygotes, respectively, but were effectively absent in Hoxa- 10 and Hoxa- 11 +/− forelimbs. In the hindlimb, distal tibial/fibular thickening and loss of tibial/fibular fusion were observed in > 80 % of transheterozygotes but in no Hoxa- 10 or Hoxa- 11 +/− hindlimbs, and all transheterozygotes displayed reduced medial patellar sesamoids, compared to modest incidences in Hoxa- 10 and Hoxa- 11 +/− mutants. Furthermore, while the <b>reproductive</b> <b>tracts</b> of Hoxa- 10 and Hoxa- 11 single heterozygous mutants of both sexes were primarily unaffected, male transheterozygotes displayed cryptorchidism and abnormal tortuosity of the ductus deferens, and female transheterozygotes exhibited abnormal uterotubal junctions and narrowing of the uterus. In addition we observed that the targeted mutations of Hoxa- 10 and Hoxa- 11 each affected the expression of the other gene in the developing prevertebra and <b>reproductive</b> <b>tracts.</b> These results provide a measure of the functional redundancy of Hoxa- 10 and Hoxa- 11 and {{a deeper understanding of the}} phenotypes resulting in the single mutants and help elucidate the regulatory interactions between these two genes...|$|R
