40|$|This work {{basically}} {{describes the}} process of obtaining translucent structural composite components using a novel process. The efficacy of the process yields translucent composites coupled with high structural integrity for the composite systems. The end use applications that {{can be thought of}} in this context are aircraft’s windows, side windows of automobiles, sub-components of submarines, decorative murals and several structural composite parts calling for extremely high resin-fibre integrity. 	The process highlights the appropriate positioning of the mould plates, with primary emphasis on the reinforcement layout {{in such a way as}} to maximise the <b>resin</b> <b>ingress</b> into the micro structure of the fabric(yarn bundles) due to the combined effects of anti-gravity and capillary action coupled with appropriate positioning of the inlet and outlet ports. Where applicable, best use is made of the optical properties of the reinforcement/resin systems (such as glass- epoxy/polyester) to render translucent characteristics without compromising on the other structural requirement parameters. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn many {{high-performance}} applications {{there is}} a need to join steel to CFRP parts. However the stiffness mismatch between these materials leads to high stress concentrations in such joints. This paper uses the biomimetics approach to help develop solutions to this problem. Nature has found many ingenious ways of joining dissimilar materials, with a transitional zone of stiffness at the insertion site commonly used. In engineering joints, one way to reduce the material stiffness mismatch is to gradually decrease the effective stiffness of the steel part of the joint by perforating it with holes. This paper investigates joining of flat perforated steel plates to a CFRP part by a co-infusion resin transfer moulding process. The possible effect of mechanical interlocking as resin fills the perforations is assessed by filling the holes with PTFE prior to moulding to prevent such <b>resin</b> <b>ingress.</b> The joints are tested under static tensile loading. The perforated steel joints show a 175 % increase of joint strength comparing to non-perforated joints. Finite element analyses are used to interpret the experimental results. It has been found that the model is able to reproduce with accuracy the experimental load–displacement test curves and show the failure mechanisms of the joint...|$|E
