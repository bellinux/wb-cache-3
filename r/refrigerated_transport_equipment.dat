40|$|The {{regulations}} and the technical specifications for international carriage of perishable foodstuffs {{and for the}} special equipment {{to be used for}} such carriage are prescribed in the international ATP Agreement. The refrigerated special equipment has to be checked for quality conformity with the ATP standards, at officially designated national ATP test stations. Some of the alternatively proposed ATP testing procedures for checking of the in-service and second-hand <b>refrigerated</b> <b>transport</b> <b>equipment</b> are incomplete and can give incorrect test results. The consequence is increase in energy consumption and an increased environmental pollution through CO, emission. This study analyses the ATP testing procedures for in-service equipment, investigates the impact on the environmental and gives some proposals for improvement.

40|$|The {{commercial}} food sector, including agriculture, food manufacture {{transport and}} retailing {{is responsible for}} 22 % of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Food distribution and retail accounts for approximately one third of this, with food transport which includes motive power and refrigeration estimated {{to be responsible for}} 1. 8 % of total emissions [1]. Road <b>transport</b> refrigeration <b>equipment</b> are required to operate reliably in much harsher environments than stationary refrigeration equipment. Due to the wide range of operating conditions and constraints imposed by available space and weight, <b>transport</b> refrigeration <b>equipment</b> have lower efficiencies than stationary systems. This, coupled to rapidly increasing use of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>transport</b> arising from the much wider range of transported goods, home delivery and greater quality expectations, is placing considerable pressures on the food industry to reduce the energy consumption of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>transport.</b> This report provides a review of food transport refrigeration and recent research into the development and application of alternative technologies to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions...|$|R

The conversion was not completed until June 1945 and work on Cefalu was not due until July. Even the conversion of Contessa was ineffective with the ship being returned to San Francisco on 20 September 1945 because its refrigeration could not maintain required low temperatures in the tropics.|$|R

40|$|In 2002, over {{a million}} {{refrigerated}} road vehicles, 400, 000 refrigerated containers and many thousands of other forms of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>transport</b> systems are used to distribute chilled and frozen foods throughout the world. All these transportation systems are expected to maintain {{the temperature of the}} food within close limits to ensure its optimum safety and high quality shelf life.

Much of this effort has concentrated on the modelling of refrigeration processes that change the temperature of the food such as chilling, freezing and thawing. The purpose of a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>transport</b> system is to maintain the temperature of the food and appears to have attracted less attention from modellers.
