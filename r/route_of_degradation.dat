50|$|The {{first major}} <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> of {{carbophenothion}} in rats is sulfoxidation, as {{displayed on the}} right. This product can be further transformed into 4-chlorobenzenesulphinic and 4-chlorobenzenesulphonic acid. A second major route involves the formation of 4-chlorothiophenol, which is further transformed via methylation and ring-hydroxylation to 4-Chloro-3-hydroxyphenyl methyl sulfone. This is then converted in approximately equal proportions to sulphate and glucuronide conjugates. Furthermore, there are metabolites that presumably arise from the cleavage of the P-S bond such as 4-chlorophenylsulphinylmethyl methyl sulphone.

In general, NER consist of covalently bound and biogenic residues [53] as well as sequestered or entrapped xenobiotic molecules in structural voids and hydrophobic interiors of micelle-like humic aggregates [54]. The first two fractions are considered to {{be an integral part of}} the organic soil or sediment matrix. The third fraction of NER might be reversibly sorbed and slowly released over long time leading to small extractable amounts. This was recently shown by Jablonowsky et al.

However, the concentrations were so small that DT 50 or half-life estimations would not be quantitatively altered. Moreover, the particular concern of PBT compounds is the combination of the three characteristics, and, in this context the bioavailability, i.e., that they will be present in amounts that are toxic or bioaccumulate is essential [56].|$|E

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> triazine- 2 -(14) C metsulfuron-methyl in soil under laboratory conditions. A High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with an UV detector and an on-line radio-chemical detector, plus a Supelco Discovery column (250 x 4. 6 mm, 5 μm), and PRP- 1 column (305 x 7. 0 mm, 10 μm) was used for the HPLC analysis. The radioactivity was determined by a Liquid Scintillation Counter (LSC) in scintillation fluid. The soil used was both sterilized and non-sterilized in order to observe the involvement of soil microbes. The estimated DT 50 and DT 90 values of metsulfuron-methyl in a non-sterile system were observed to be 13 and 44 days, whereas in sterilized soil, the DT 50 and DT 90 were 31 and 70 days, respectively. The principal degradation product after 60 days was CO 2. The higher cumulative amount of (14) CO 2 in (14) C-triazine in the non-sterilized soil compared to that in the sterile system suggests that biological degradation by soil micro-organisms significantly contributes to the dissipation of the compound.

40|$|In higher eukaryotes L-lysine can be {{degraded}} via {{two distinct}} routes including the saccharopine pathway and the L-pipecolate pathway.

40|$|This review aims {{to provide}} an {{overview}} of current knowledge on stabilization of proteins by sugars in the solid state in relation to stress conditions commonly encountered during drying and storage. First protein degradation mechanisms in the solid state (i. e. physical and chemical degradation routes) and traditional theories regarding protein stabilization (vitrification and water replacement hypotheses) will be briefly discussed. Secondly, refinements to these theories, such as theories focusing on local mobility and protein-sugar packing density, are reviewed in relationship to the traditional theories and their analogies are discussed. The last section relates these mechanistic insights to the stress conditions against which these sugars are used to provide protection (i. e. drying, temperature, and moisture). In summary sugars should be able to adequately form interactions with the protein during drying, thereby maintaining it in its native conformation and reducing both local and global mobility during storage. Generally smaller sugars (disaccharides) are better at forming these interactions and reducing local mobility as they are less inhibited by steric hindrance, whilst larger sugars can reduce global mobility more efficiently. The principles outlined here can aid in choosing a suitable sugar as stabilizer depending on the protein, formulation and storage condition-specific dominant <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation.</b> (C) 2017 The Authors.

30|$|Di Gialleonardo et al. {{showed that}} [11 C]HTP {{accumulation}} in a pancreatic neuroendocrine cell line was significantly increased by blocking the major <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation,</b> monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) [2]. Furthermore, {{this mode of}} degradation was not present in a ductal cell line. The authors therefore posit that an HTP analogue, following the formation of 5 -hydroxy-[11 C]tryptamine ([11 C] 5 -HT) by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), resistant to MAO-A-mediated degradation will have an increased retention in neuroendocrine tissues containing the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) mechanism. APUD cells include not only the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas but in a broader scope also many forms of NETs. In fact, [11 C]HTP-PET was originally developed for assessment of the AADC step in serotonin biosynthesis but has found extensive use as a highly sensitive diagnostic tool for primary or metastatic NETs [1]. However, the contrast to surrounding tissues and hence the sensitivity {{are affected by the}} rapid MAO-A-mediated conversion of [11 C] 5 -HT into 5 -hydroxy-[11 C]indoleacetic acid ([11 C] 5 -HIAA). Current strategies to improve contrast involve peroral administration of the AADC inhibitor carbidopa, which increases the biological half-life of the tracer by reducing peripheral metabolism, e.g., in the liver. However, this method induces large individual variations in tracer metabolism and precludes comparison between examinations and therefore therapy efficacy monitoring [5]. Increased retention of [11 C]HTP in NETs could improve the sensitivity of examination in addition to potentially visualizing smaller NETs currently below detection threshold.|$|E

Eliciting high titres of neutralising antibodies at the mucosal portals of viral entry is a key goal in HIV vaccine research. Thus, this thesis specifically focuses at the strategic development and evaluation of women-controlled mucosal vaccine delivery systems for HIV envelope based constructs, H 4 A, gp 140 and FP-A for the purpose of eliciting high antibody titres at the vaginal mucosa. Sustained release rod-insert vaginal rings (RiRs) loaded with gp 140, quick release rods containing H 4 A, FP-A loaded liposomal gels and microneedles in conjunction with mucosal inoculations were evaluated for induction of specific antibodies in animal models (sheep/mice/rabbits). The formulations were evaluated mainly using vaginal delivery with nasal route being used as an auxiliary. However, we found that the nasal route was extremely potent compared to the vaginal route for the induction of antibody responses. In addition, we found that there is a definite rationale for sustained vaginal delivery ofvaccines. FP-A loaded gels showed ability to elicit neutralising antibody at mucosal sites and are hence being scaled to GMP production with a view to progressing them to clinical trials. Storage stability of bovine serum albumin (BSA) loaded RiRs and protein loaded immediate release dosage forms were also evaluated. Protein aggregation was found {{to be the most important}} <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> of BSA in RiRs, while freeze-drying induced changes predominate in the immediate release dosage forms.

40|$|Ionisable {{pesticides}} can {{be partially}} ionised {{within the range}} of natural soil pH and this strongly influences their reactivity in soils. This group includes important, worldwide contaminants of groundwater and surface waters. It is essential that their specific behaviour is recognised within risk assessment procedures. Experiments were carried out with ten pesticides (six acids and four bases) and nine arable soils (range in pH, texture and organic matter content) to advance the understanding and prediction of the behaviour of ionisable pesticides in soils. The main conclusions can be summarised as follows: • Adsorption of ionisable pesticides tends to be stronger in soils with lower pH and containing more organic carbon. A regression equation including Log D (lipophilicity corrected for pH), the soil organic carbon content and a pesticide descriptor was selected to predict the adsorption of acids. The behaviour of bases was more complex and approaches specific to each compound seem to be required. • There were some marked differences between the soils in their ability to degrade the different ionisable pesticides. The lack of consistent behaviour renders a global approach to prediction of degradation unrealistic. Distinct types of behaviour could however be distinguished according to the main <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation.</b> • Significant correlations between sorption and degradation were only observed for three pesticides out of ten, with faster degradation in soils with stronger sorption. • A centrifugation technique was used to measure adsorption at realistic soil moisture contents and provides a robust characterisation of the fraction of pesticide available for leaching. Time-dependent adsorption was also assessed. The increase in adsorption between one and seven days was not directly related to the level of adsorption although it was more important in soils containing more organic carbon. Although specific interactions between pesticides and soils are still not fully understood, these results provide the basis for a more robust analysis of the behaviour of ionisable pesticides in the environment...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mammalian}} <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> lysine {{is believed}} to proceed via two distinct routes, the saccharopine and the pipecolic acid routes, that ultimately converge {{at the level of}} α-aminoadipic semialdehyde (α-AASA). α-AASA dehydrogenase-deficient fibroblasts were grown in cell culture medium supplemented with either l-[α- 15 N]lysine or l-[ε- 15 N]lysine to explore the exact <b>route</b> <b>of</b> lysine <b>degradation.</b> l-[α- 15 N]lysine was catabolised into [15 N]saccharopine, [15 N]α-AASA, [15 N]Δ 1 -piperideine- 6 -carboxylate, and surprisingly in [15 N]pipecolic acid, whereas l-[ε- 15 N]lysine resulted only in the formation of [15 N]saccharopine. These results imply that lysine is exclusively degraded in fibroblasts via the saccharopine branch, and pipecolic acid originates from an alternative precursor.

40|$|A complex {{network of}} central {{synaptic}} transmission is regulated, in vertebrates, by simple amino acids: GABA, with inhibitory effects, and glutamate, {{the most abundant}} excitatory amino acid in the CNS. These two fundamental neurotransmitters {{are responsible for the}} homeostasis of all the CNS functions, from post-natal developmental age to the entire adult life. Even slight dysregulations of GABA-ergic and glutamat-ergic systems underlie the genesis and the progression of a number of neurological pathologies, both neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. GABA-based drugs are widely used in clinic for the treatment of different pathological states, such as anxiety, epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Conversely, the dissociative anaesthetic ketamine and the pro-cognitive agent memantine, are the only glutamatergic drugs which have found clinical use, despite the large volume of evidences that unequivocally link glutamate to CNS diseases. Due to the tight linkage between glutamate transmission and several metabolic cascades, both in periphery and in the CNS, the modulation of enzymatic pathways, leading to the biosynthesis of metabolites able to interfere with the glutamatergic system, offers a viable way to design novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of a wide spectrum of invalidant neurological conditions. The kynurenic pathway of tryptophan metabolism is the main <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> of the essential, proteinogenic amino acid L-tryptophan in mammals and is responsible for the production of several neuroactive compounds, most of which endowed with specific actions towards glutamate receptors: i) kynurenic acid, wide spectrum competitive antagonist of ionotropic glutamate receptors and negative allosteric modulator of α 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, with neuroprotective properties, ii) 3 -hydroxykynurenine, neurotoxic for its ability to generate free radical species, iii) xanthurenic acid, modulator of Group II metabotropic Glu receptors, iv) cinnabarinic acid, selective mGlu 4 orthosteric partial agonist and v) quinolinic acid (QUIN), an endogenous excitotoxin acting as a selective NMDARs agonist. Since the inhibition of the production of QUIN has been proposed as a valid approach for the drug discovery in the field of neurological disorders, this doctoral thesis is aimed at the design and synthesis of novel inhibitors of the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of QUIN, namely 3 -hydroxyanthranilate 3, 4 -dioxygenase (3 -HAO). Previously described 3 -HAO inhibitors are halogenated substrate analogues and are characterized by high chemical instability, due to the common o-aminophenol core. In this work, a series of novel potential 3 -HAO inhibitors has been designed and synthesized, based on the chemically stable pyridine N-oxide nucleus. Biological tests have shown interesting activity for three of the synthesized compounds in vitro, with IC 50 values ranging between 0. 6 μM and 100 μM. A preliminary SAR profile has been drawn for this class of 3 -HAO inhibitors, based on the relative activities of test compounds and on docking studies performed by our group of molecular modelling. The most active compound, 2 -amino- 6 -methylnicotinic acid 1 -oxide, was also tested in vivo and resulted active, showing modulatory activity on the production of different kyurenine pathway metabolites, in lesioned rat brain. These findings demonstrated the suitability of the 2 -aminopyridine- 1 -oxide scaffold for the design of novel, chemically stable 3 -HAO inhibitors which, being active in vivo, open the road to further studies, aimed at the full characterization of the involvement of the kynurenine pathway in the onset and the progression of neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, such as Huntington’s disease and multiple sclerosis...|$|E

Enrofloxacin, applied at 10 ppm, was transformed into metabolites already after about 1 week. The most stable intermediates present in 2 -day-old supernatants were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Eight of 11 proposed molecular structures could be confirmed by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or by cochromatography with reference compounds. We identified (i) 3 -, 6 -, and 8 -hydroxylated congeners of enrofloxacin, which have no or only very little residual antibacterial activity; (ii) 5, 6 - (or 6, 8 -), 5, 8 -, and 7, 8 -dihydroxylated congeners, which were prone to autoxidative transformation; (iii) an isatin-type compound {{as well as an}} anthranilic acid derivative, directly demonstrating cleavage of the heterocyclic core of enrofloxacin; and (iv) 1 -ethylpiperazine, the 7 -amino congener, and desethylene-enrofloxacin, representing both elimination and <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> the piperazinyl moiety. The pattern of metabolites implies four principle <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> which might be simultaneously employed.

Hydroquinone was originated by hydroxylation of N,N-diethyl aniline. An equilibrium cycle among quinone, hydroquinone and Fe(III)-hydroquinone was exhibited through the formation of charge transfer complex.|$|R
40|$|Quantifying {{the extent}} of {{biodegradation}} of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) in contaminated soils and sediments is challenging because of competing oxidative and reductive reaction pathways. We have previously shown that the stable isotope fractionation of NACs reveals the <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> {{even if it is}} simultaneously caused by different bacteria. However, it is unclear whether compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) can be applied in situations where multiple pollutants are biodegraded by only one microorganism under multi-substrate conditions. Here we examined the C and N isotope fractionation of 2 -nitrophenol (2 -NP) and 3 -nitrophenol (3 -NP) during biodegradation by Pseudomonas putida B 2 through monooxygenation and partial reductive pathways, respectively, in the presence of single substrates vs. binary substrate mixtures. Laboratory experiments showed that the reduction of 3 -NP by Pseudomonas putida B 2 is associated with large N and minor C isotope fractionation with C and N isotope enrichment factors, ε_C and ε_N, of − 0. 3 ± 0. 1 ‰ and − 22 ± 0. 2 ‰, respectively. The opposite isotope fractionation trends were found for 2 -NP monooxygenation. In the simultaneous presence of 2 -NP and 3 -NP, 2 -NP is biodegraded at identical rate constants and ε_C and ε_N values (− 1. 0 ± 0. 1 ‰ and − 1. 3 ± 0. 2 ‰) to those found for the monooxygenation of 2 -NP in single substrate experiments. While the pathway and N isotope fractionation of 3 -NP reduction (ε_N = − 24 ± 1. 1 ‰) are independent of the presence of 2 -NP, intermediates of 2 -NP monooxygenation interfere with 3 -NP reduction. Because neither pH, substrate uptake, nor aromatic substituents affected the kinetic isotope effects of nitrophenol biodegradation, our study illustrates that CSIA provides robust scientific evidence for the assessment of natural attenuation processes...|$|R

The design of DEMON was motivated by the fact that, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, state-of-the-art preemptive route recovery solutions for on-demand MWN routing protocols are only designed with the objective <b>of</b> minimizing <b>route</b> disconnections due to node mobility. However, a comprehensive preemptive solution should consider other causes <b>of</b> <b>route</b> performance <b>degradation,</b> such as inter-flow interference or congestion, and have appropriate route maintenance mechanisms in order to re-route active flows if their performance becomes compromised.|$|R
40|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} of alkanolamines {{are widely}} used {{for the removal of}} acidic gases such as H 2 S, CO 2, COS and CS 2 in the sour gas treatment process. In spite of the resistance of alkanolamines to chemical breakdown, plant and laboratory reports indicate that, on prolonged use, alkanolamines may be transformed into undesirable products from which the amines are not easily recovered. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as 'amine degradation', not only leads to amine losses, but may also contribute to operational problems such as foaming, corrosion, high solution viscosity and fouling as a result of decreasing the plant life. Amine based gas purification plants having absorption and stripping system, solvents are degraded at these two units mainly by oxidative degradation at absorber condition and thermal degradation at stripper condition. Identification <b>of</b> amine <b>degradation</b> <b>routes,</b> remediation <b>of</b> <b>degradation,</b> types <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> products and studies on degradation reaction mechanism becomes essential for successful plant operation. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), ion chromatograph (IC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared absorption spectrometry (FT-IR) are extensively used to identify the various degradation products. A comprehensive review of the latest research activities on alkanolamines degradation, best method for identification, various properties <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> products and their classification is presented in this paper.

40|$|Here we {{show that}} bortezomib induces {{effective}} proteasome inhibition and accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells. This leads to induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as demonstrated by accumulation of the protein CHOP, as well as autophagy, as demonstrated by accumulation of LC 3 -II proteins. Our data suggest that recruitment of both ubiquitinated proteins and LC 3 -II by p 62 directs ubiquitinated proteins, including I-kBa,to the autophagosome. <b>Degradation</b> <b>of</b> I-kBa results in increased NF-kB nuclear translocation and transcription activity. Since bortezomib treatment promoted I-kBa phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation, {{this suggests that the}} <b>route</b> <b>of</b> I-kBa <b>degradation</b> was not via the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system. The autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) significantly inhibited bortezomib-induced I-kBa degradation, increased complex formation with NF-kB and reduced NF-kB nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity. Importantly, the combination of proteasome and autophagy inhibitors showed synergy in killing DLBCL cells. In summary, bortezomib-induced autophagy confers relative DLBCL cell drug resistance by eliminating I-kBa. Inhibition of both autophagy and the proteasome has great potential to kill apoptosisresistan...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{analysed}} the effects of S-nitrosocysteine (CysNO) on adult human red blood cell metabolism and observed that metabolic response depended {{on the degree of}} cell oxygenation. In particular, glucose metabolised through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was higher in treated erythrocytes than in untreated cells only at high O 2 pressure. Since, following the treatment of intact cells with CysNO, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) activities did not evidence any significant alteration, the possibility that the stimulation of PPP was triggered by a CysNO mediated modification of these enzymes was excluded. Intracellular S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), detected only in treated red blood cells, may be linked solely to the exposition to the NO donor. A possible rationalisation of the different metabolic behaviour shown by erythrocytes as a function of their oxygenation state is proposed. It takes into account the different <b>route</b> <b>of</b> catabolic <b>degradation</b> observed in vitro for GSNO under aerobic and anaerobic condition...|$|R
40|$|The pharmacist, both in {{community}} and hospital pharmacy practice, is often challenged with {{the preparation of}} a liquid dosage form not available commercially. A number of parameters {{need to be considered}} in the formulation of both a stable and bioavailable liquid dosage form, howeverlimited formulation and stability data is available to the pharmacist. This study reviews the stability considerations of 83 liquid dosage forms,extemporaneously prepared from commercially available products as opposed to raw material, as thisis the situation most commonly encountered in practice. Results indicate that only 7. 2 % of the formulations (i. e. captopril, hydralazine hydrochloride, isoniazid, levothyroxine sodium, phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride, and tetracycline hydrochloride) present stability considerations. Inclusion of the antioxidant, sodium ascorbate in the captopril liquid dosage form resulted in improved stability at 4 ꃮ Hydralazine hydrochloride, isoniazid and phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride were adversely affected due to interactions with excipients in the formulation, while the effect of the preservative in lowering the pH in a levothyroxine sodium mixture resulted in decreased stability. Interestingly the instability of these formulationswas primarily due to interactions between the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and the formulation excipients, rather than <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> the API by standard routes such as oxidation, hydrolysis, photolysis or thermolysis. This low percentage of instability illustrates the low risk associated with these dosage forms. Further, pharmacists taking cognisance of factors such as drug stability, mechanisms and <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation,</b> and potential interactions with excipients in the tablets and/or capsules utilised in the preparation of the formulation, are further able to minimise the risk involved. When considering the safety and efficacy of liquid dosage forms prepared extemporaneously, it is thereforeimportant to consider not only the stability of the drug substance but also the entire formulation. Amanagement flow chart to address the issues of liquid preparations in practice is presented to further assist the pharmacist in minimising the risk involved, thus ensuring that safe, effective and high quality products are delivered to patients.

40|$|Protein {{degradation}} {{mediated by}} the 26 S proteasome is fundamental for cell survival in eukaryotes. There are two known routes for substrate presentation to the 26 S proteasome- the ubiquitin-dependent route and the ubiquitin-independent route. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) {{is one of the}} most well-known ubiquitin-independent substrates of the proteasome. It is a homodimeric protein functioning as a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis. Polyamines regulate ODC levels by a feedback mechanism {{mediated by the}} ODC regulator called antizyme. Higher cellular polyamine levels promote translation of antizyme mRNA and inhibit ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> the antizyme protein. Antizyme binds ODC monomers and targets them to the proteasome without ubiquitylation. The mechanism of this ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation is poorly understood. Therefore, the major aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism <b>of</b> ubiquitin-independent <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> the ODC by the 26 S proteasome. We show that polyamines, besides their role in regulating antizyme synthesis and stability, directly enhance antizyme-mediated ODC degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Polyamines specifically enhanced the <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> ODC by the proteasome both in vivo in yeast cells and in a reconstituted in vitro system. ODC is shown to be targeted in a manner quite distinct from ubiquitin-dependent substrates as its degradation was enhanced in a mutant lacking multiple ubiquitin receptors. These and other findings indicate, however, that there is a convergence point for the two <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> because ubiquitin-dependent substrates compete with ODC for degradation. Using an in vitro assay, it could be shown that the unstructured N-terminal degron, ODS, is essential for binding of ODC to the proteasome. In vivo studies using proteasomal ATPase mutants, in which tyrosine residues in so-called pore loops were mutated to alanine (Y-A), further showed that the pore loops of Rpt 4 and Rpt 5 are of critical importance for ODC degradation and suggested that ODS might be recognized by these ATPase subunits. Additional experiments revealed that antizyme promotes ODC degradation most likely by providing an additional binding site. An ODS-antizyme-Ura 3 fusion protein was degraded faster in a ubiquitin-independent but proteasome-dependent manner than ODS-Ura 3. Furthermore, a ubiquitin-dependent mode <b>of</b> ODC <b>degradation</b> is also reported. Upon overexpression under the PCUP 1 promoter, efficient <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> ODC involved a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism. This <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> ODC was independent of ODS and antizyme. Together, the findings described in this thesis provide novel insights into the mechanism of proteolytic regulation of ODC. With ODC being a validated target for cancer therapy, a detailed understanding of this mechanism may contribute to the discovery of new therapies targeting the polyamine pathway...|$|R
