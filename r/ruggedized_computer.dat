50|$|Intended for the Radio Reconnaissance Teams {{attached}} to Marine Expeditionary Units, the radio reconnaissance equipment program (RREP) SIGINT suite (SS)-1 is a semiautomated, integrated, open architecture radio intercept and DF system {{composed of a}} <b>ruggedized</b> <b>computer</b> and six functional modules that plug together. RREP SS-1 modules may operate independently or semi-independently. SS-1 enables the radio reconnaissance teams (RRTs) to target the majority of low-level, single-channel, unencrypted tactical signals of interest used by military, police, insurgents, and other potential hostile forces throughout the world.|$|E
50|$|ZKJ-4B series CDS with {{modular design}} {{is the first}} Chinese CDS {{utilizes}} <b>ruggedized</b> <b>computers,</b> {{and it is the}} Chinese equivalent of Italian Alenia IPN-10 combat data system, and borrowed heavily from SADOC 2 (systema dirizione della operazioni di combattimento) CDS, the export version of IPN-10 delivered to China in 1985. The Italian design features such as three-man level display and MIL-STD-1553B spec/standard are adopted for later models. ZKJ-4B incorporates 052 Integrated Command Decision-making System (052综合指挥决策系统), a software named after Type 052 destroyer it was planned to equip, and it is decision making software developed by Dalian Naval Academy. After land trials in 1990 in Lianyungang, ZKJ-4B was shipped to Shanghai and installed onboard Type 052 destroyer No. 112.|$|R

It featured non-volatile magnetic core memory and was housed in a heavy-duty metal cube-shaped box {{which was designed to}} fit through a 25-inch circular hatch.|$|R
50|$|MDM {{functionality}} {{can include}} over-the-air distribution of applications, data and configuration settings {{for all types}} of mobile devices, including mobile phones, smartphones, tablet <b>computers,</b> <b>ruggedized</b> mobile <b>computers,</b> mobile printers, mobile POS devices, etc. Most recently laptops and desktops {{have been added to the}} list of systems supported as Mobile Device Management becomes more about basic device management and less about the mobile platform itself. MDM tools are leveraged for both company-owned and employee-owned (BYOD) devices across the enterprise or mobile devices owned by consumers. Consumer Demand for BYOD is now requiring a greater effort for MDM and increased security for both the devices and the enterprise they connect to, especially since employers and employees have different expectations concerning the types of restrictions that should be applied to mobile devices.|$|R
40|$|The main {{purposes}} of the conference were (1) to promote the inter-change of ideas among users of ruggedized minicomputers through description of individual applications, and (2) {{to report to the}} computer manufacturer any con-cerns individual users had relating to the operation of either hardware or soft-ware supplied by the manufacturer. While all conference activities related to the use of a single manufacturer's <b>ruggedized</b> <b>computers,</b> many of the novel ideas discussed at this conference have a much wider scope of applicability. None of the company/user interchanges relating to the use of ruggedized minicomputers manufactured by a specific vendor has been included in this publication. The Fourth Users Group Conference contained presentations covering a wide range of topics, including (1) the role of minicomputers in the development and/ or certification of new commercial or military airplanes in both the United States and Europe, (2) generalized software error detection techniques, (3) realtime software development tools, (4) a redundancy management research tool €or aircraft navigation/flight control sensors, (5) extended memory management technique...|$|R

50|$|A rugged (or ruggedized, {{but also}} ruggedised) {{computer}} {{is a computer}} specifically designed to operate reliably in harsh usage environments and conditions, such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures and wet or dusty conditions. They are designed from inception {{for the type of}} rough use typified by these conditions, not just in the external housing but in the internal components and cooling arrangements as well. In general, <b>ruggedized</b> and hardened <b>computers</b> share the same design robustness and frequently these terms are interchangeable.|$|R
50|$|Soil survey, soil mapping, is {{the process}} of {{classifying}} soil types and other soil properties in a given area and geo-encoding such information. It applies the principles of soil science, and draws heavily from geomorphology, theories of soil formation, physical geography, and analysis of vegetation and land use patterns. Primary data for the soil survey are acquired by field sampling and by remote sensing. Remote sensing principally uses aerial photography, but LiDAR and other digital techniques are steadily gaining in popularity. In the past, a soil scientist would take hard-copies of aerial photography, topo-sheets, and mapping keys into the field with them. Today, a growing number of soil scientists bring a <b>ruggedized</b> tablet <b>computer</b> and GPS into the field with them. The tablet may be loaded with digital aerial photos, LiDAR, topography, soil geodatabases, mapping keys, and more.|$|R
50|$|The 1602B and 2150 I/O {{boxes were}} {{developed}} and standardized expressly for the Army ILS program and were top sellers at the time. The Rolm 1602 was used on AN/MLQ-34 'TACJAM' {{as the primary}} mission computer. The 1666 was leveraged into the GLCM (Ground Launched Cruise Missile) and SLCM (Surface Launched Cruise Missile) hardware for McDonnell Douglas (MDAC), St. Louis, and the follow-on 1666B was incorporated into MDAC's Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TWCS). Despite developing most products with Rolm's own money, the substantial increase in military sales in the 1980s caused {{the loss of the}} commercial exemption enjoyed in the early years. This required all product-pricing to be negotiated directly with the DoD, so margins eroded somewhat. Some 32-bit machines (versus 16-bit) were developed into the Hawk/32 computer and sold well. Engineering in the latter years scrambled {{to come up with a}} new product line as the military was enticed into <b>ruggedized</b> commercial <b>computer</b> systems by Rugged Digital, and Rolm worked on a militarized version of Mercury Computer's Digital Signal Processor. Brisk sales of the DG-based computers continued up to the time the ROLM Mil-Spec Computer division was closed in June 1998.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ruggedized</b> Grid Compass <b>computer</b> {{was used}} {{since the early}} days of the Space Shuttle program. The first {{commercial}} laptop used in space was a Macintosh portable in 1991 aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-43. Apple and other laptop computers continue to be flown aboard manned spaceflights, though the only long duration flight certified computer for the International Space Station is the ThinkPad. As of 2011, over 100 ThinkPads were aboard the ISS. Laptops used aboard the International Space Station and other spaceflights are generally the same ones that can be purchased by the general public but needed modifications are made to allow them to be used safely and effectively in a weightless environment such as updating the cooling systems to function without relying on hot air rising and accommodation for the lower cabin air pressure. Laptops operating in harsh usage environments and conditions, such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty conditions differ from those used in space in that they are custom designed for the task and do not use commercial off-the-shelf hardware.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an innovative concept {{and implementation of}} a maintenance system enabling tele-cooperation of distributed technical personnel. It provides a synchronous shared visual workspace in remote locations with limited bandwidth. A mechanic at the remote location uses an Augmented Reality (AR) system which {{is connected to the}} Virtual Reality (VR) system of an expert at the homeland. The expert interactively creates 3 D instructions on his VR system that are displayed on a <b>ruggedized</b> hand-held tablet <b>computer</b> of the mechanic. The mechanic considers and follows these instructions during his maintenance work. In addition he can interact in real time with the live AR view creating spatial references for the expert. The system has been evaluated by 18 experienced automobile mechanics, 6 of them technical soldiers of the German army. The maintenance task consisted of the disassembly of the camshaft housing of an internal combustion engine. The results show clearly that participants completed significantly more tasks and used less verbal instructions when using the VR system compared to a video system. Thus, performance was increased by the system. In the paper we will detail the concept, give an overview of the implemented system and present the results of the practical evaluation...|$|R
