5|$|Initially, in fact, Brezhnev portrayed {{himself as}} a moderate— not as radical as Kosygin but not as {{conservative}} as Shelepin. Brezhnev gave the Central Committee formal permission to initiate Kosygin's 1965 economic reform. According to historian Robert Service, Brezhnev did modify some of Kosygin's <b>reform</b> <b>proposals,</b> {{many of which were}} unhelpful at best. In his early days, Brezhnev asked for advice from provincial party secretaries, and spent hours each day on such conversations. During the March 1965 Central Committee plenum, Brezhnev took control of Soviet agriculture, another hint that he opposed Kosygin's reform program. Brezhnev believed, in contrast to Khrushchev, that rather than wholesale re-organization, the key to increasing agricultural output was making the existing system work more efficiently.|$|E

5|$|An {{individual}} mandate {{coupled with}} subsidies for private insurance {{as a means}} for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan <b>reform</b> <b>proposals.</b> The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care. It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} fields, he {{was influenced by}} the principles of physiocracy, an economic doctrine that considered that nature was the source of wealth. As a result, much of his works and <b>reform</b> <b>proposals</b> at the Consulate were oriented towards improving agriculture, livestock, manufacturing, and free trade. He maintained a fluent contact with the consulates of other cities, developing a view of the viceroyalty as a whole. This led to an increased work in cartography of the largely unpopulated areas of the territory; the maps designed during this period would later prove a great help for José de San Martín during the Crossing of the Andes. He introduced new crops, and promoted the use of local fauna for livestock production. He protected the weaving industry by increasing the production of cotton in Cochabamba, as he considered the local crop to be of similar quality to the cotton from Europe.|$|E
5|$|SJS has {{roots in}} {{criminal}} trials during the Vietnam War era, but {{in modern times}} is usually employed in high-stakes civil litigation (where only money is usually at issue, in contrast to criminal trials, where the defendant can go to prison). SJS practitioners determine what background characteristics and attitudes predict favorable results, and then coordinate with attorneys in choosing the jury. Studies are mixed as {{to the effectiveness of}} the practice, though {{it is clear that the}} evidence presented at trial is the most important determiner of verdicts (the trial result) and that SJS is more likely to have an impact where that evidence is ambiguous. SJS's potential to unfairly skew the jury has led to some <b>reform</b> <b>proposals,</b> but none have yet been implemented. The limited fictional portrayals of SJS have been negative towards the practice.|$|E

5|$|Wooller was a {{dissident}} {{member of the}} Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). In 1991, Wooller accused the ICAEW of having built-in bias when it marked examinations during a recession, and used PE II (Professional Education II) results to show the bias. Wooller was fined by the ICAEW in 1995 for promoting unaccredited MBA courses. Wooller formed a ginger group when the ICAEW tried to merge with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) in 1995. Wooller's ginger group opposed many {{of the actions of}} the ICAEW. The merger was shelved after the majority of the ICAEW members voted against it. The ginger group decided to keep fighting for democratic reforms and in June 1996, demanded that the executive of the ICAEW be elected directly by the 109,000 members of the body, instead of by the ICAEW's council of seventy members. A year later, Wooller demanded that members of the ICAEW be allowed to vote on Peter Gerrard's key constitutional <b>reform</b> <b>proposals,</b> and Wooller's motion failed by 1,400 votes, including proxies.|$|E
5|$|The average {{ordinary}} {{revenue of}} the republic at this time amounted to between 28 and 35 million guilders. However, since {{the outbreak of the}} war in 1793 the expenditure had been running at between 40 and 55 millions. For the year 1800 the republic had to find 78 million guilders for its expenditures. In other words, the new Agent of Finance, Gogel, was faced with a financial emergency. He needed to generate about 50 million guilders annually in ordinary revenue on a permanent basis urgently. Besides, as the Dutch tax system was heavily skewed toward highly regressive indirect taxes, which inordinately burdened the impoverished population, he wanted to change this to a system that depended more on direct (income and wealth) taxes. Finally, he wanted {{to do away with the}} provincial differentiation in the taxation, and construct a nationally standardized system. When he put these <b>reform</b> <b>proposals</b> to the Representative Assembly on 30 September 1799, they met with massive resistance. This led to so much delay in its acceptance that by the time it was to be implemented (in 1801) the re-federalisation of the state by the new Staatsbewind regime was already underway. Eventually, Gogel's reforms were only implemented under the successor state of the Kingdom of Holland.|$|E

25|$|Tsang {{became the}} Chief Secretary for Administration in 2001 {{and ran for}} the Chief Executive in 2005 after {{incumbent}} Tung Chee-hwa resigned. He served the remaining term of Tung and was re-elected in 2007. He served a full five-year term until he stepped down in 2012. In his seven years of term, he proposed two constitutional <b>reform</b> <b>proposals</b> in 2005 and 2010 and saw the second ones passed after he reached a compromise with the pro-democracy legislators, making it the first and only political <b>reform</b> <b>proposals</b> to be passed in the SAR history. He carried out a five-year policy blueprint and ten large-scale infrastructure projects during his term. His popularity began to decline after the introduction of the Political Appointments System which was marked by controversies and scandals.|$|E
25|$|On 15 March 1517, the Fifth Council of the Lateran {{closed its}} {{activities}} {{with a number}} of <b>reform</b> <b>proposals</b> (on the selection of bishops, taxation, censorship and preaching) but not on the major problems that confronted the Church in Germany and other parts of Europe. A few months later, on 31 October 1517, Martin Luther issued his 95 Theses in Wittenberg.|$|E
25|$|International {{comparisons}} of healthcare {{have found that}} the United States spends more per-capita than other similarly developed nations but falls below similar countries in various health metrics, suggesting inefficiency and waste. In addition, the United States has significant underinsurance and significant impending unfunded liabilities from its aging demographic and its social insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid (Medicaid provides free long-term care to the elderly poor). The fiscal and human impact of these issues have motivated <b>reform</b> <b>proposals.</b>|$|E

25|$|In August 1945, the {{provisional}} government adopted the first sweeping agricultural reforms in Albania's history. The country's 100 largest landowners, who controlled {{close to a}} third of Albania's arable land, had frustrated all agricultural <b>reform</b> <b>proposals</b> before the war. The communists' reforms were aimed at squeezing large landowners out of business, winning peasant support, and increasing farm output to avert famine. The government annulled outstanding agricultural debts, granted peasants access to inexpensive water for irrigation, and nationalized forest and pastureland.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} {{increasing}} amounts of care, and known weaknesses in the care system (such as skilled workforce shortages and rationing of available care places), led several reviews in the 2000s to conclude that Australia's aged care system needs reform. This culminated in the 2011 Productivity Commission report and subsequent <b>reform</b> <b>proposals.</b> In accordance with the Living Longer, Living Better amendments of 2013, assistance is provided in accordance with assessed care needs, with additional supplements available for people experiencing homelessness, dementia and veterans.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, the {{conservative}} constitutional <b>reform</b> <b>proposals</b> and National People's Congress Standing Committee's (NPCSC) restriction on the nomination {{process of the}} Chief Executive also triggered the 79-day occupy movement, as proposed by the pro-democracy group Occupy Central with Love and Peace. To counter the occupy movement, {{the conservative}} activists led by former radio host Robert Chow also formed the Alliance for Peace and Democracy to launch signature campaigns to oppose the occupy movement. By the time, many pro-government activist groups began to emerge such as Voice of Loving Hong Kong, Caring Hong Kong Power and Hong Kong Youth Care Association.|$|E

No members from the United Democrats was appointed as PWC member or Hong Kong Affairs Advisor.|$|R
25|$|The MHP's {{manifesto}} {{pledged to}} extend education to nine years and {{to end the}} Solution process with Kurdish militants.

Pressing for a manufacturing based economy, the MHP has also pledged to investigate every individual involved in the 2013 government corruption scandal and to establish an anti-corruption commission to lead the investigation. The MHP has also promised a strong, international response to terrorism and to {{raise the minimum wage}} to ₺1,400.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Merriam {{served on}} the Commission of Inquiry on Public Service Personnel, a {{research}} group established by the Social Science Research Council to research, analyze, and make proposals regarding the federal civil service and civil service reform (with an eye to the innovations made by the Tennessee Valley Authority). The body {{was funded by the}} Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Foundation, and Luther Gulick was the Commission's research director. The group made a number of important proposals regarding civil service reform, although not all were adopted. It did spark interest in the merit system, and many of its civil service <b>reform</b> <b>proposals</b> were adopted by several states.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} other {{necessary}} reforms, the new president, Allan McEvey, {{set up a}} new review committee of two, Dom Serventy and himself. Serventy, a scientist with the CSIRO, was the principal writer of the review report and he addressed both the need for a sense of what the RAOU should be doing, and the structure that would allow it to do so. Although there was considerable vocal opposition to the <b>reform</b> <b>proposals</b> (including cutting the number of people on Council from an unwieldy forty to just nine) the report was ratified by Council in April 1969 and adopted at an Extraordinary General Meeting in June 1969, with the vote being over 80% in favour. Later that year came the first issue of the RAOU Newsletter, a publication that would evolve to become the magazine Wingspan.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{both the}} macroeconomic and microeconomic implications for self-management of a current {{school of thought}} in Yugoslavia. Specifically, it examines the monetary theory of Ivo Perisin, Asim Stranjak, Antun Sokman, Milutin Golijanin and others associated with the Yugoslav Monetary <b>Reform</b> <b>Proposal</b> currently under discussion in Yugoslavia. ^ In this work I discuss the similarities in approach between the nineteenth-century Banking School and the Yugoslav Monetary <b>Reform</b> <b>Proposal.</b> I also examine the similarity in approach between Marxian monetary theory and the <b>Reform</b> <b>Proposal.</b> A major portion of the dissertation is devoted to refuting the claim made by the Yugoslav authors of the Reform that their monetary theory is rooted in Marxian value theory. It is concluded that due to several methodological errors, several of which are shared by the Banking School and examined in full in this dissertation, that these Yugoslav monetary theorists more properly belong in the camp of Tooke and Fullarton than of Marx. ^ At {{the heart of the}} <b>Reform</b> <b>Proposal</b> is the real bills doctrine. In addition to examining the macroeconomic consequences of employing the real bills doctrine as a theory of finance in a Western market economy, this dissertation asks whether it may be appropriate as a foundation for monetary policy in the self-managed Yugoslavia. The major finding of this dissertation is that under current institutional arrangements and with current investment and pricing policies pursued in Yugoslavia today, this theory of finance is inappropriate. ...|$|R
50|$|In 2010, the government's {{constitutional}} <b>reform</b> <b>proposal</b> {{became the}} first and only constitutional move was passed by the Legislative Council in the SAR era {{with the support of the}} pro-democracy Democratic Party after the Chinese government accepted the modified package as presented by the party, which increased the composition of the Legislative Council from 60 to 70 seats; increasing five extra seats in the directly elected geographical constituencies and five new District Council (Second) functional constituency seats which are nominated by the District Councillors and elected by all registered electorates.
