Max-min fairness is one way to define fairness and several algorithms how to compute max-min fair <b>rate</b> <b>allocations</b> are already published. In this paper we make two major contributions to this area of research: First, we formulate an algorithm achieving max-min fairness among end-to-end flows based on the effective load of a collision domain.

40|$|Abstract — Fidelity {{is one of}} the key {{considerations}} in data collection schemes for sensor networks. A second important consideration is the energy expense of achieving that fidelity. Data from multiple correlated sensors is collected over multihop routes and fused to reproduce the phenomenon. However, the same distortion may be achieved using multiple <b>rate</b> <b>allocations</b> among the correlated sensors. These <b>rate</b> <b>allocations</b> would typically have different energy cost in routing depending on the network topology. We consider the interplay between these two considerations of distortion and energy. First, we describe the various factors that affect this trade-off. Second, we discuss bounds on the achievable performance with respect to this tradeoff. Specifically, we relate the network lifetime Lt to the distortion D of the delivered data. Finally, we present low-complexity approximations for the efficient computation of the Lt(D) bound. I...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the media-specific <b>rate</b> <b>allocation</b> problem in multipath networks. The streaming rate on each path is determined {{such that the}} end-to-end media distortion is minimized, when the receiving client aggregates packets received via multiple network channels. As {{it is difficult for}} the media server to have the full knowledge about the network status, we propose a distributed path selection and <b>rate</b> <b>allocation</b> algorithm. The network nodes participate to the optimization strategy, based on their local view of the network status. This eliminates the need for end-to-end network monitoring, and allows for the deployment of large scale <b>rate</b> <b>allocation</b> solutions. We design an optimal <b>rate</b> <b>allocation</b> algorithm, where the media client iteratively updates the best set of streaming paths. According to this <b>rate</b> <b>allocation,</b> each intermediate nodes then forwards incoming media flows on the outgoing paths, in a distributed manner. The proposed algorithm is shown to quickly converge to the optimal <b>rate</b> <b>allocation</b> solution, and hence to lead to stable <b>rate</b> <b>allocation</b> solutions. We also propose a greedy distributed algorithm that achieves closeto-optimal end-to-end distortion performance in a single pass. Both algorithms are shown to outperform simple heuristic-based <b>rate</b> <b>allocation</b> approaches for numerous random network topologies, and therefore offer an interesting solution for media-specific <b>rate</b> <b>allocation</b> over large scale multi-path networks.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>rate</b> <b>allocation</b> method for MPEG- 4 fine {{granularity}} scalable (FGS) video streaming, {{with which the}} received image quality can be smoothed during the streaming period. Although average bit <b>rate</b> <b>allocation</b> is quite simple, the image’s quality changes greatly between frames, which will result in quality fluctuation and degrade the streaming quality. In this paper the bits are allocated to those frames according to their rate-distortion curve {{in order to obtain}} the same objective quality. Fast <b>rate</b> <b>allocation</b> algorithm of equal image quality is implemented based on Newton search method, which is much faster than linear search method. It is important to realize fast <b>rate</b> <b>allocation</b> for bit-stream truncating in practical video streaming applications.
