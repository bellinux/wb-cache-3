A variant of this structure that allows for linear movement of one set of plates to change the plate overlap area is also used and {{might be called a}} slider.

50|$|A {{loop antenna}} is a closed circuit radio antenna, {{consisting}} of a loop or coil of wire, tubing, or other electrical conductor ideally fed by a balanced source or feeding a balanced load. Within this physical description there are two distinct antenna types: The large <b>resonant</b> <b>loop</b> antenna with a circumference close to one wavelength and the small loop which when used only for receive on low frequencies can {{be as little as}} 1% of a wavelength in circumference, but when used for transmission is typically about 5 to 30% of a wavelength in circumference. Most loop antennas are resonated to the operating frequency. The full wavelength loop is self resonant, small transmitting loops use a series capacitor to achieve resonance and the small receiving loop uses multiple turns and a parallel capacitor which resonates with the net inductance of the loop itself.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{convenience}} of using electronic devices, contactless energy transfer (CET) systems have garnered interest in various fields of industry. In this paper, a new design approach that uses antiparallel <b>resonant</b> <b>loops</b> for CET systems is presented. Forward and reverse loops forming an antiparallel resonant struc-ture stabilize the transfer efficiency and therefore prevent it from dramatic distance-related changes, a phenomenon that can occur in CET systems with nonradiative methods (or resonant methods). This paper proposes frequency-insensitive antiparallel <b>resonant</b> <b>loops</b> and the optimal design of these loops for uniform trans-fer efficiency according to the distance. The proposed technique achieves frequency variation that is one-sixth that of conventional unidirectional loops, thus improving the power efficiency to a max-imum of 87 %. The improved performance of data transmissions for near-field communication is also verified.

40|$|Magneto-inductive (MI) waveguides are linear {{arrangements}} of magnetically coupled L–C resonators that propagate electrical energy at radio frequency without direct connection. To achieve the strong magnetic coupling needed for low-loss propagation, adjacent elements {{must be in}} such close proximity that electric coupling arises. In contrast to electric coupling in split ring resonators, the coupling occurs between the inductive tracks of adjacent <b>resonant</b> <b>loops.</b> Parasitic capacitance is demonstrated in flexible magneto-inductive cable, and shown to introduce additional propagation bands above the MI band. Simple models are developed to predict this effect, and strategies discussed to improve high-frequency isolation...|$|R
50|$|Often thickly {{layered with}} samples, one {{defining}} feature of Thes One's {{work is that}} it never sounds choppy, but rather like a reconstructed piece of music. A fan of filtering pieces of music, his work is often underlined by layers of <b>resonant</b> <b>loops</b> with sharp filter q's. His earlier work was often critically classified as derived from the golden era of New York City production, with jazzy loops and horn samples coming together to create the sonic landscape, but his later work showed more of an individual progression and closer ties to the modern soul/funk sound of Los Angeles. He has stated in interviews that he prides himself {{in the fact that}} he has tried to use different drum sounds for every beat he has made, whether released or unreleased.|$|R
5000|$|Additional gain (and a uni-directional {{radiation}} pattern) {{is usually}} obtained {{with an array}} of such elements either as a driven endfire array or in a Yagi configuration (with all but one loop being parasitic elements). The latter is widely used in amateur radio where it is referred to as a quad antenna (see photo). [...] "Quad" [...] loops may be {{in the shape of a}} circle, a square or any other closed geometric shape that allows the total perimeter to be one wave length. The most popular quad antenna in amateur radio consists of a <b>resonant</b> <b>loop</b> (and usually additional parasitic elements) in a square shape, so that it can be constructed of wire strung across a supporting ‘X’ frame. Other [...] "quads" [...] rotate this 45 degrees to a diamond shape. Triangular loops have also been used.|$|E
50|$|Surprisingly, the {{radiation}} and receiving pattern {{of a small}} loop is quite opposite that of a large self <b>resonant</b> <b>loop</b> (whose circumference is close to one wavelength). Since the loop is much smaller than a wavelength, the current at any one moment is nearly constant round the circumference. By symmetry {{it can be seen}} that the voltages induced along the flat sides of the loop will cancel each other when a signal arrives along the loop axis. Therefore, there is a null in that direction. Instead, {{the radiation}} pattern peaks in directions lying in the plane of the loop, because signals received from sources in that plane do not quite cancel owing to the phase difference between the arrival of the wave at the near side and far side of the loop. Increasing that phase difference by increasing the size of the loop has a large impact in increasing the radiation resistance and the resulting antenna efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|Self <b>resonant</b> <b>loop</b> antennas are {{relatively}} large, {{governed by the}} intended wavelength of operation. They are mainly used at frequencies above 3.5 MHz where their size is manageable. They {{can be viewed as}} a folded dipole deformed into an open shape. This shape can be a circle, triangle, square, or rectangle, or in fact any polygon. The maximum radiation is at right angles to the plane of the loop (See pattern below). At the lower frequencies the physically large loop would be [...] "laying down", that is, supported above the ground by several masts.The main beam is upwards. Above 10 MHz, the loop is more frequently [...] "standing up", that is in the vertical plane, to direct energy towards the horizon. The loop may be rotatable. Compared to a dipole or folded dipole, it transmits slightly less toward the sky or ground, giving it about 1.5 dB higher gain in the two favoured horizontal directions.|$|E
40|$|A {{powerful}} time-domain FDTD-SPICE simulator {{is implemented}} {{and applied to}} the broadband analysis of metamaterials integrated with active and tunable circuit elements. First, the FDTD-SPICE modeling theory is studied and details of interprocess communication and hybridization of the two techniques are discussed. To verify the model, some simple cases are simulated with results in both time domain and frequency domain. Then, simulation of a metamaterial structure constructed from periodic <b>resonant</b> <b>loops</b> integrated with lumped capacitor elements is studied, which demonstrates tuning resonance frequency of medium by changing the capacitance of the integrated elements. To increase the bandwidth of the metamaterial, non-Foster transistor configurations are integrated with the loops and FDTD-SPICE is applied to successfully bridge the physics of electromagnetic and circuit topologies and to model the whole composite structure. Our model is also applied to the design and simulation of a metasurface integrated with nonlinear varactors featuring tunable reflection phase characteristic...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{results have}} shown that the high {{harmonic}} fast wave (HHFW) at 30 MHz can provide substantial plasma heating and current drive for the NSTX spherical tokamak operation. However, the present antenna strap design rarely achieves the design goal of delivering the full transmitter capability of 6 MW to the plasma. In order to deliver more power to the plasma, a new antenna strap design and the associated coaxial line feeds are being constructed. This new antenna strap design features two feedthroughs to replace the old single feed-through design. In the design process, CST Microwave Studio has been used to simulate the entire new antenna strap structure including the enclosure and the Faraday shield. In this paper, the antenna strap model and the simulation results will be discussed in detail. The test results from the new antenna straps with their associated <b>resonant</b> <b>loops</b> will be presented as well...|$|R
50|$|Developed using common lab equipment, {{the first}} {{magnetron}} {{consisted of a}} copper block with six holes drilled through it to produce the <b>resonant</b> <b>loops,</b> which was then placed in a bell jar and vacuum pumped, which was itself placed between the poles of the largest horseshoe magnet they could find. A test of their new cavity magnetron design in February 1940 produced 400 watts, and within a week it had been pushed over 1.000 watts. The design was then demonstrated to engineers from GEC, who were asked to try to improve it. GEC introduced {{a number of new}} industrial methods to better seal the tube and improve vacuum, and added a new oxide-coated cathode that allowed for much greater currents to be run through it. These boosted the power to 10 kW, about the same power as the conventional tube systems used in existing radar sets. The success of the magnetron revolutionised the development of radar, and almost all new radar sets from 1942 on used one.|$|R
5000|$|These loops {{are small}} in {{comparison}} to the full wave loop, typically between 5% and 30% of a wavelength in circumference but considerably larger than the small receiving loop. They are typically used on frequencies between 3 and 30 MHz. They usually consist of a single turn of large diameter conductor, and are typically round or octagonal to provide maximum enclosed area for a given perimeter. The smaller of these loops show efficiencies well below that of the self resonant loops, but where space is at a premium, can provide effective communications. Loop antennas are relatively easy to build. A small transmitting loop antenna, also known as a magnetic loop,with a circumference 10% of a wavelength or less, will have a relatively constant current distribution along the conductor, and the main lobe will be in the plane of the loop. Loops of any size between 10% and 100% of a wavelength in circumference can be built and tuned to resonance with series reactance. A capacitor is required for a circumference less than a half wave, an inductor for loops more than a half wave and less than a full wave. Loops in this size range may have neither the uniform current of the small loop, nor the double peaked current of the full sized loop and thus cannot be analyzed using the concepts developed for the small receiving loops nor the self <b>resonant</b> <b>loop</b> antennas. Performance is best determined with NEC analysis. Antennas within this size range include the halo (see below) and the G0CWT (Edginton) loop.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a low RCS reflectarray at 8. 52 GHz by replacing the solid metal sheet behind the antenna with a band stop frequency selective surface. A 50 element linear array of omni-directional elements was used to simulate the far field pattern of a reflectarray with f/D= 0. 325 in the plane of the elements to assess the effect of an imperfect aperture distribution on the gain and sidelobe levels. It is found that the reflection loss variation across the aperture does not {{have a significant effect on}} the radiation pattern of the antenna, because for the layout that was studied, only a few of <b>resonant</b> <b>loops</b> were predicted to give a significantly different loss than the others in the array. Simulated and measured results show that the ‘in-band’ reflection phase response of the structure with metal ground plane and with a periodic FSS ground plane is very similar, however the periodic ground plane reduces the ‘out of band’ reflectivity by more than 4 dB, thereby decreasing its RCS profile to these signals. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The {{circular}} {{loop antenna}} {{has been investigated}} by many authors beginning as early as 1897 with Pocklington's study of the thin wire loop excited by a plane wave. Later, both Hallen and Storer considered the case of driven antennas. All of these authors used a Fourier series expansion for the loop current, and the latter two found numerical difficulties with the approach. These difficulties, as pointed out by Wu, can be avoided by integration of the free-space Green's function over the toroidal surface of the wire. The theory developed here is an improvement on previous works because it specifically {{takes into account the}} finite dimension of the wire. Consequently, the range of validity for our solution extends to fatter wires than previously considered. Furthermore, some detail of the loop current around the cross section of the wire is revealed. The theory, if applied to thin wire loops, gives radiation admittances in excellent agreement with results obtained by previous investigators.

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} {{for determining the}} mass density of a moving filament is provided. The method includes the steps of providing a filament across two supports, tensioning the filament, inducing a vibration into the filament segment between the supports, reinforcing the vibration using an amplified feedback signal, detecting the vibrational frequency data, processing the data using a fast-fourier transform analysis, and then displaying the frequency. The use of the feedback signal results in a self-tuning <b>resonant</b> <b>loop.</b> Open loop versions may also be used. The apparatus includes a base supporting a fixed support and a transducer which in turn supports a moveable support. The transducer vibrates the moveable support transversely to the direction of travel of the filament, thereby inducing a transverse vibrational mode.

40|$|Inductive {{noise in}} {{high-performance}} microprocessors is a reliability issue caused by variations in processor current (di/dt) which are converted to supply-voltage glitches by impedances {{in the power}}-supply network. Inductive noise has been addressed by using decoupling capacitors to maintain low impedance in the power supply {{over a wide range}} of frequencies. However, even well-designed power supplies exhibit (a few) peaks of high impedance at resonant frequencies caused by RLC <b>resonant</b> <b>loops.</b> Previous architectural proposals adjust current variations by controlling instruction fetch and issue, trading off performance and energy for noise reduction. However, the proposals do not consider some conceptual issues and have implementation challenges. The issues include requiring fast response, responding to variations that do not threaten the noise margins, or responding to variations only at the resonant frequency while the range of high impedance extends to a resonance band around the resonant frequency. While previous schemes reduce the magnitude of variations, our proposal, called resonance tuning, changes the frequency of current variations away from the resonance band to a non-resonant frequency to be absorbed by the power supply. Because inductive noise is a resonance problem, resonance tuning reacts only to repeated variations in the resonance band, and not to isolated variations. Reacting after a few repetitions allows more time for the response and reduces unnecessary responses, decreasing performance and energy loss. ...|$|R
40|$|A guided radar arc {{detection}} and localization {{system has been}} designed, fabricated, installed in the feed line {{to one of the}} <b>resonant</b> <b>loops</b> on the 285 / 300 FW antenna, and successfully tested during vacuum conditioning. The system injects a train of binary phase-modulated pulses at a carrier frequency of 25 MHz up-shifted to around 450 MHz into the main high power transmission line connected to the antenna through a septate coupler and a circulator. The pulses are reflected by arcs, and the time delay provides the distance to the arc. The reflected signals are analyzed in real time, with a time response sufficient to provide active arc detection as well as localization. RF pulses have been injected into the antenna at a power level of up to 650 kW. The arc location was varied by either puffing gas into the vacuum vessel, in which case arcs always occurred in the antenna, or injecting RF without a gas puff, in which case the arcs almost always occurred in the transmission line feeding the antenna. The localization obtained during these initial tests had a relatively low resolution of about 2 m, but arcs occurring inside or outside the antenna could clearly be differentiated and corresponded with the expected location. The septate coupler proved fully compatible with the antenna feed and matching network and improved performance significantly in comparison to the use of directional coupler...|$|R

The HHFW {{system on}} NSTX has {{operated}} {{with the full}} 12 -antenna, 6 -transmitter configuration, delivering over 2 MW reliably for pulse lengths over 100 ms with various phasings of the antenna system.

When {{it is used to}} extract the effects of the plasma on the rf circuit, pronounced asymmetries in antenna loading are observed, even when antenna phasing is symmetrical (e. g., 0 0 0 … [...] ). The loading of the plasma on the antenna has been calculated with the RANT 3 D code using measured edge density profiles in front of the antenna; these agree with measured loading values.

40|$|Quantum Dimer Models (QDM) arise as {{low energy}} {{effective}} models for frustrated magnets. Some {{of these models}} have proven successful in generating a scenario for exotic spin liquid phases with deconfined spinons. Doping, i. e. the introduction of mobile holes, has been considered within the QDM framework and partially studied. A fundamental issue is the possible existence of a superconducting phase in such systems and its properties. For this purpose, {{the question of the}} statistics of the mobile holes (or "holons") shall be addressed first. Such issues are studied in details in this paper for generic doped QDM defined on the most common two-dimensional lattices (square, triangular, honeycomb, kagome, [...] .) and involving general <b>resonant</b> <b>loops.</b> We prove a general "statistical transmutation" symmetry of such doped QDM by using composite operators of dimers and holes. This exact transformation enables to define duality equivalence classes (or families) of doped QDM, and provides the analytic framework to analyze dynamical statistical transmutations. We discuss various possible superconducting phases of the system. In particular, the possibility of an exotic superconducting phase originating from the condensation of (bosonic) charge-e holons is examined. A numerical evidence of such a superconducting phase is presented {{in the case of the}} triangular lattice, by introducing a novel gauge-invariant holon Green's function.

40|$|The {{photonic}} {{band gap}} is investigated in network system formed by array of one-dimensional waveguides. The band structures for the periodic networks: chain network in one dimension, honeycomb and square networks in two dimensions and diamond network {{in three dimensions}} are studied in details. In the simplest configuration of these periodic networks, no complete band gap exists in any dimensions. By introducing appropriate ‘resonant loops’, Mie resonance-like wave scattering takes place inside the loops and complete photonic band gaps are opened at the anti-resonant frequencies of the loops. This is novel because it means the possibly of making tunable photonic band gaps at desirable frequency ranges by using the network system. In addition to the periodic networks, study of quasi-periodic (QP) networks is also presented in this thesis. It is found that the pentagonal (5 -fold) and the 2 D dodecagonal (12 -fold) QP networks both possess photonic band gaps {{even in the absence}} of <b>resonant</b> <b>loops.</b> In particular, the gap found in the dodecagonal QP network is large and robust, independent of the system size. For the 3 D quasi-periodic network, we find that the icosaheral network posses even larger PBG that that of the dodecagonal network. On the other hand, large PBGs also exist in triangular and face-centered cubic periodic networks. The existence of large and robust intrinsic photonic band gaps in these networks is found to be depend only on the resonant scattering inside the internal loops of the networks, independent of system size and insensitive to orientational symmetry...|$|R

Closed-form expres-sions for the efficiencies of both systems, {{as a function}} of frequency and system (circuit) parameters, are presented. In the frequency-tuned system, the operating frequency is adjusted to compensate for changes in mutual inductance that occur for variations of transmitter and receiver loop positions. Frequency-tuning is employed for a range of distances over which the loops are strongly coupled.
