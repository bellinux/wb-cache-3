5|$|Arroway falls {{unconscious}} as {{she begins}} traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens {{to find herself}} {{on the floor of}} the pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private conversation, Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's <b>recording</b> <b>device</b> only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to expand the SETI program.|$|E

25|$|In each case, the {{principal}} distinction {{between what is}} and is not covered by the AHRA is determined by whether or not the device is marketed or designed (or in the case of media, commonly used by consumers) to make audio recordings, not the device's capabilities. A CD-R recorder included as part of a personal computer would not be a digital audio <b>recording</b> <b>device</b> under the Act, since the personal computer was not marketed primarily for making copies of music. The same recorder, sold as a peripheral and marketed {{for the express purpose of}} making digital audio recordings, would fall under the Act's definition of a <b>recording</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

50|$|It {{is illegal}} to use {{listening}} or <b>recording</b> <b>devices</b> that are not permitted for public use.

25|$|Using {{electronic}} stethoscopes, it {{is possible}} to record heart sounds via direct output to an external <b>recording</b> <b>device,</b> such as a laptop or MP3 recorder. The same connection can be used to listen to the previously recorded auscultation through the stethoscope headphones, allowing for more detailed study of murmurs and other heart sounds, for general research as well as evaluation of a particular patient's condition.|$|E
25|$|Some {{electronic}} stethoscopes feature direct {{audio output}} {{that can be}} used with an external <b>recording</b> <b>device,</b> such as a laptop or MP3 recorder. The same connection can be used to listen to the previously recorded auscultation through the stethoscope headphones, allowing for more detailed study for general research as well as evaluation and consultation regarding a particular patient's condition and telemedicine, or remote diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the sounds}} are {{transmitted}} electronically, an electronic stethoscope {{can be a}} wireless device, can be a <b>recording</b> <b>device,</b> and can provide noise reduction, signal enhancement, and both visual and audio output. Around 2001, Stethographics introduced PC-based software which enabled a phonocardiograph, graphic representation of cardiologic and pulmonologic sounds to be generated, and interpreted according to related algorithms. All of these features are helpful for purposes of telemedicine (remote diagnosis) and teaching.|$|E

25|$|Berger's first <b>recording</b> <b>device</b> {{was very}} rudimentary. He {{inserted}} silver wires under the scalps of his patients. These were later replaced by silver foils {{attached to the}} patient's head by rubber bandages. Berger connected these sensors to a Lippmann capillary electrometer, with disappointing results. However, more sophisticated measuring devices, such as the Siemens double-coil recording galvanometer, which displayed electric voltages as small as one ten thousandth of a volt, led to success.|$|E
25|$|The Tachograph is a <b>recording</b> <b>device</b> that {{combines}} {{the functions of}} a clock and a speedometer. A controller (device) is a device used to measure and regulate {{the speed of a}} machine, such as a motor (Greek: tele = far away (distant), tacho = speed, graphein = write). A tachograph is a card with a device fitted to a vehicle that automatically records its speed and distance, together with the driver's activity selected from a choice of modes.|$|E

25|$|In {{areas where}} {{analogue}} signals had terminated, older receiving equipment {{was likely to}} require replacement or upgrade. This process was subsidised by the UK Government for those on low incomes. Contracts for this operation were awarded to BSkyB in the Border Television region. Upgrading of analogue receiving equipment required a Freeview set-top box (or other DVB-T capable digital receiver). Where an analogue TV <b>recording</b> <b>device</b> was in use this ideally would require a separate Freeview set-top box, to replicate the previous functionality of recording and watching different programme sources.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} test call on August 3, 1876, Alexander Graham's uncle, Professor David Charles Bell, spoke {{to him from the}} Brantford {{telegraph}} office, reciting lines from Shakespeare's Hamlet ("To be or not to be...."). The young inventor, positioned at the A. Wallis Ellis store in the neighboring community of Mount Pleasant, received and may possibly have transferred his uncle's voice onto a phonautogram, a drawing made on a pen-like <b>recording</b> <b>device</b> that could produce the shapes of sound waves as waveforms onto smoked glass or other media by tracing their vibrations.|$|E
25|$|The {{music of}} France {{reflects}} a {{diverse array of}} styles. In the field of classical music, France has produced a number of prominent romantic composers, while folk and popular music have seen {{the rise of the}} chanson and cabaret style. The earliest known sound <b>recording</b> <b>device</b> in the world, the phonautograph, was patented in France by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville in 1857. France is also the 5th largest market by value in the world, and its music industry has produced many internationally renowned artists, especially in the nouvelle chanson and electronic music.|$|E

25|$|Baird's {{numerous}} other developments demonstrated his particular talent at invention. He was a visionary {{and began to}} dabble with electricity. In 1928, he developed an early video <b>recording</b> <b>device,</b> which he dubbed Phonovision. The system consisted of a large Nipkow disk attached by a mechanical linkage to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record and play back a 30-line video signal. Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, {{but some of the}} original phonodiscs have been preserved, and have since been restored by Donald McLean, a Scottish electrical engineer.|$|E
25|$|Between 1990 and 1994, Bond {{collaborated with}} artist Liam Gillick on their Documents Series {{a group of}} eighty-three fine art works which {{appropriated}} the modus operandi of a news gathering team, to produce relational art. To make the work the duo posed as a news reporting team—i.e., a photographer and a journalist—often attending events scheduled in the Press Association's Gazette—a list of potentially newsworthy events in London. Bond worked as if a typical photojournalist, joining the other press photographers present; whilst Gillick operated as the journalist, first collecting the ubiquitous Press kit before preparing his audio <b>recording</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
25|$|Preliminary {{observations}} by {{the investigators}} {{indicated that the}} aircraft was in a slightly left-wing-low-and-nose-high attitude on impact. The wreckage was contained in a field 150 metres square about two kilometres southwest of Îles-de-la-Madeleine Airport; the aircraft had hit the ground and slid for 91 metres before coming to a stop. Examination of the wreckage showed the engines were running until the impact with the ground. The MU-2 was not fitted with flight recorders (which are not required for light aircraft), but {{a different type of}} onboard <b>recording</b> <b>device</b> was installed and it appeared to be intact. The wreckage was removed from the crash site and transported to the TSB's laboratory in Ottawa on April 6. The investigation is ongoing. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board sent a representative to the American-built plane's crash site. Mitsubishi also sent investigators to the site.|$|E
