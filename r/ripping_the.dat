5|$|Night Trap {{designer}} Rob Fulop was irked {{that his}} relatively tame game was being compared to Mortal Kombat, {{which features a}} character <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> heart out of a defeated opponent. Nintendo senior vice president Howard Lincoln testified {{in front of the}} committee, stating Night Trap would never appear on a Nintendo system because it did not pass their guidelines. Fulop later explained that Lincoln was referring to the technical guidelines; the game could not run on a Nintendo system {{due to the lack of}} a CD-ROM drive, but Lincoln made it sound as if the game was unworthy of Nintendo's moral standards. Critics noted this as a deliberate move from Nintendo to distance themselves from the scandal and make Sega look unfavorable.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, Alma made {{landfall}} on Trinidad with {{winds of}} 55mph (90km/h), the southernmost landfall on that island since a storm in 1933. Even though the storm traversed Trinidad in only three hours, its time over land {{was sufficient to}} disrupt the circulation. The storm crossed the Gulf of Paria and made its second and final landfall on the Paria Peninsula of Venezuela, one of only four storms on record to do so; the others were in 1605, 1725, and 1933. The high mountains in Venezuela took a toll on the storm, <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> circulation and causing Alma to be downgraded to a tropical depression on August15. At 02:00UTC that day, Alma's circulation passed near Caracas. The convection rapidly diminished, and the storm's presence on satellite imagery faded, though the NHC noted the potential for redevelopment once it reached open waters. The storm did not survive its trek over land; late on August15, the NHC issued the final advisory after the circulation dissipated near the border of Venezuela and Colombia. The remnants of Alma continued westward across South and Central America, reaching the Pacific Ocean where they would eventually restrengthen into Hurricane Joyce.|$|E
5|$|The safety {{cars were}} {{deployed}} {{to slow the}} race as marshals worked for twenty-two minutes to dry the spilled oil along the Mulsanne Straight. As the safety cars were recalled, Lotterer in the No. 7 Audi used slower traffic to pass both Porsche drivers {{in front of him}} and take over the race lead, just as Nico Hülkenberg moved to fourth place by passing the remaining Audi cars. In the LMP2 category the safety car had split the field up, leaving the TDS Racing and KCMG Oreca-Nissan cars forty seconds ahead of their class rivals. Richard Bradley for KCMG was able to fight with TDS Racing's Tristan Gommendy on the restart and eventually retake the class lead it had lost at the race start. Lotterer was later forced to give up the race lead as a puncture on one of the No. 7's tyres required an extra pit stop, allowing Hartley's No. 17 Porsche to the front of the race. Duval was caught on an approach to a slow zone (which was enforced to allow a marshal to retrieve debris at Indianapolis) by a group of slowed LMGTE cars and took avoiding action by steering right into the grass off track. The No. 8 Audi clipped the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari's right-hand section and was thrown back sideways across the track, impacting the outside barriers head on heavily driving into Indianapolis corner and <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> car's front bodywork off. Safety cars were required once again as the barriers needed lengthy repairs, while Duval was able to drive the damaged Audi back to the garage. Repairs took less than five minutes and the car resumed in eighth place.|$|E

25|$|The nanocellulose fibrils may be {{isolated}} from the wood-based fibers using mechanical methods which expose the pulp to high shear forces, <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> larger wood-fibres apart into nanofibers. For this purpose, high-pressure homogenizers, ultrasonic homogenizers, grinders or microfluidizers can be used. The homogenizers are used to delaminate the cell walls of the fibers and liberate the nanosized fibrils. This process consumes very large amounts of energy and values over 30 MWh/tonne are not uncommon.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the names}} are the 189 men of the 43rd Divisional Reconnaissance Regiment who were aboard the ill-fated Derrycunihy. On the night of 23 July 1944, the ship was {{anchored}} {{off the coast of}} Ouistreham (Sword Beach), and the regiment was awaiting to disembark. At 0800 the ship’s engines detonated a submerged German mine, <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> hull apart. This was the biggest British loss of life off the Normandy beaches.

25|$|Research into {{methods to}} control the spread of E. sturtii {{initially}} focused on regeneration following severe fires in 1974 in the Ivanhoe (NSW) district. The results showed that E. sturtii was particularly good at regeneration after fire and ‘recovery seemed independent of burning conditions and shrub size’. Later studies of ‘grubbing’ techniques in the Cobar region of New South Wales have shown that <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> plants from the soil, and then covering the exposed roots with soil, {{has been the most}} effective method of control.|$|E
25|$|Fragility and vulnerability: {{overhead}} electrification {{systems can}} suffer severe disruption due to minor mechanical faults or {{the effects of}} high winds causing the pantograph of a moving train to become entangled with the catenary, <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> wires from their supports. The damage is often {{not limited to the}} supply to one track, but extends to those for adjacent tracks as well, causing the entire route to be blocked for a considerable time. Third-rail systems can suffer disruption in cold weather due to ice forming on the conductor rail.|$|E
25|$|Raw bones fed to dogs contain high {{amounts of}} calcium and {{phosphorus}} {{that is essential}} for neuromuscular, cardiovascular, immune, endocrine and clotting function. The ratio of calcium to phosphorus for adult dogs should be 1:1. Compared to commercial dog food, the raw food diet allows dogs to work for their meal, <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> meat off bones and then gnawing at the bones. In regards to dental health, bone to tooth gnawing allows a dog to rid their teeth of plaque buildup promoting good oral health. Skeptics argue however that this isn't healthy for dogs and it can cause dental fractures.|$|E

25|$|The Peripheral Vertical Launch System (PVLS) is {{an attempt}} to reclaim the prized center space of the hull while {{increasing}} the safety of the ship from the loss of the entire missile battery and the loss of the ship {{in the case of a}} magazine explosion. The system scatters pods of VLS around the outer shell of the ship having a thin steel outer shell and a thick inner shell. The design of the PVLS would direct the force of the explosion outward rather than <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> ship in half. Additionally, this design reduces the loss of missile capacity to the pod being hit.|$|E

She proved unable to deal with the resourcefulness of Martha Kent, and was set ablaze by the widow, but kept regenerating until Krypto intervened, <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> black ring out of her hand and preventing regeneration for long enough to allow Superman and Conner Kent to destroy the Black Lantern powerhouses attacking Smallville, and reaching town to aid others unhindered.|$|E
25|$|Powell {{decided to}} return to Surratt's {{boarding}} house to seek help. His clothes were somewhat bloody from the attack at Seward's home, and he'd dropped his hat at the Seward home. During much of the Victorian era, it was considered unseemly for any man (even a menial laborer) to be seen in public without a hat, and Powell would have been viewed with suspicion had he tried to enter the city without one. <b>Ripping</b> <b>the</b> sleeve from his undershirt, Powell placed the sleeve on his head in the hope that people would think it was a stocking cap. To complete his disguise as a common laborer, he then stole a pickaxe from a farmyard. Powell then headed for Surratt's.|$|E

25|$|The duo {{returned}} {{again to}} Australia in March 2009 {{for a series}} of appearances at Westfield shopping centres on behalf of the Westfield Group. Similar to their last Australian tour, they gave live styling sessions and gave fashion advise on stages at several Westfield centres from 26 March to 3 April. Their popularity was just as strong as it was in 2007. Before their first appearance on 3 April at Westfield Parramatta in Sydney, Woodall and Constantine returned to appear on Australia's most popular morning variety show The Morning Show giving hosts Kylie Gillies and Larry Emdur styling tips. In one segment, the duo made over an old dress Gillies had bought into the show. The duo decided to give the dress a more plunging neckline, and while <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> dress down the middle from the neck, Gillies began panicking, thinking they were tearing the entire dress off, making for an embarrassing moment for Gillies while on live television.|$|E
25|$|Smith, {{although}} {{running for}} his campaign, {{would refuse to}} leave without beginning the skeleton of a new park and parkway system for Long Island {{and make sure the}} land needed would be in property of the state. Smith continued <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> politicians and that they were on the side of those in Wheatley Hills and pledged to keep the parkway out of their neighborhood. However, Smith argued that the sentiment had changed in Wheatley Hills and that most of the residents were in support of the project. However, Hewitt and Hutchinson refused to permit the money because they would not touch any money until the Southern State Parkway was completed. Smith denied that agreement ever occurred. The money {{that was supposed to be}} use was from unappropriated state land in New York City. The money for purchasing land would go to those who agreed with the LISPC on prices or those who could not afford to give away the land.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 December, a message was intercepted by Indian Intelligence {{concerning}} a high-level meeting of the civilian administration in East Pakistan. A decision was then made to mount an attack. Within 15 minutes of the interception of the message, a strike was launched against Dhaka. Armed with tourist guide maps of the city, four Mig 21s of No. 28 Squadron became airborne. Only a few minutes had passed after the meeting had started when the IAF aircraft blasted the Governors House with 57mm. rockets, <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> massive roof off the main hall and turning the building into a smoldering wreck. The Governor of East Pakistan, Mr. A. H. Malik, was so shocked after the incident that he resigned on the spot by writing his resignation {{on a piece of}} paper, thereby renouncing all ties with the West Pakistani administration. He then took refuge at the InterContinental Hotel in Dhaka under UN flag.|$|E

25|$|The main predators {{of these}} wasps are hornets (especially Vespa tropica), ichneumonid flies, and ants. The hornets attack and damage the nests by <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> cells apart with their mandibles and then extracting {{portions}} of the brood. Raided nests can easily be identified by locating cells that have been ripped or torn. When a hornet or other flying predator approaches, the wasps engage in aerial attacks by throwing themselves into {{the air in the}} direction of the potential danger. They actually engage in this behavior very frequently and do so in response to any insect of similar size to hornets that approaches the nests in a questionable manner. When ants approach or invade the nests, the wasps will either grab the ants and drag them away from the nests, or, if the ants are especially large, the wasps will first assume a defensive posture, seize the ants, and then purposely fall out of the nests to ensure the ants are removed. Spiders may also prey on these wasps, but they are much more likely to catch solitary individuals away from the nest.|$|E
25|$|From 1951 to 1953, most of {{her works}} are made from ripped {{drawings}} completed in black ink or wash in a figurative manner. By <b>ripping</b> <b>the</b> paper instead of cutting it, {{the edges of the}} figures are much more soft in comparison to the geometric and hard-edged shapes in her previous works. From 1953 to 1954, she created smaller sized collage paintings that were composed of fragments of undesired works. Some of the discarded works she used were splatter paintings completed by Pollock. Many scholars have expressed different interpretations about why she used Pollock's unwanted canvases. Some assert that she simultaneously demonstrated her admiration for his art while also recontextualizing his aggressive physicality through manipulating his images into a collage format. Others believe that she was creating a sense of intimacy between the two artists, which was lacking in their relationship by this time period, by combining their works together. By 1955, she made collage paintings on a larger scale and varied the material she used for the support, using either masonite, wood, or canvas. These works were first exhibited by Eleanor Ward at the Stable Gallery in 1955, but they received little public acclaim apart from a good review from Greenberg.|$|E
