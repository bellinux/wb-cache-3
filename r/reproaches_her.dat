25|$|In {{the dark}} attic the man finds the woman's thesis studies: terrifying {{pictures}} of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook {{in which her}} writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that while writing her thesis, she {{came to believe that}} all women are inherently evil. The man is repulsed by this and <b>reproaches</b> <b>her</b> for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest hidden fear.|$|E

2500|$|Satan disguises {{himself as}} a bright angel and talks her out of it. Eve returns to Adam, who <b>reproaches</b> <b>her.</b> Eve lies {{prostrate}} with grief. Adam complains about Satan persecuting them, and Satan explains {{that he and his}} followers refused God's command to worship both Adam, the image of the God, and God himself. Thus Satan with his angels were expelled from heaven, deprived of their glory and began to envy men. Adam, unaffected by the story, serves forty days of penance in the Jordan. (chapters 9-17) ...|$|E
2500|$|Antony {{prepares to}} battle Octavius. Enobarbus urges Antony {{to fight on}} land, where he has the advantage, instead of by sea, where the navy of Octavius is lighter, more mobile and better manned. Antony refuses, since Octavius has dared him to fight at sea. Cleopatra pledges her fleet to aid Antony. However, during the Battle of Actium off the western coast of Greece, Cleopatra flees with her sixty ships, and Antony follows her, leaving his forces to ruin. Ashamed {{of what he has}} done for the love of Cleopatra, Antony <b>reproaches</b> <b>her</b> for making him a coward, but also sets this true and deep love above all else, saying [...] "Give me a kiss; even this repays me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Margaret's {{adaptation}} to the culture is demonstrated through language (Ingham, 1996, p 62-63). When her mother <b>reproaches</b> <b>her</b> for using Milton's vulgar provincialisms (such as [...] "slack of work"), Margaret replies that since she lives in an industrial city, she must speak its language when called on to do so. She cites a word which may be vulgar but which she finds expressive ("knobstick"), and uses a local term ("redding up"; tidying) to Boucher's small children: [...] "redding up the slatternly room". Gaskell begins each chapter with a poetic quote to accentuate a relevant theme, such as interior conflicts ("My heart revolts within me, and two voices / Make themselves audible within my bosom"—Wallenstein, chapter XVIII), duality ("On earth is known to none / The smile that is not sister to a tear." [...] Elliott, chapter XXI), courtship, duty, suffering, steadfast courage, honesty, time and change.|$|E

60|$|Proud and wilful as she seemed, Elsie {{had always}} prided herself on being just, {{and to be}} placed in the {{position}} of doing an honorable man a wrong was intolerable. The longer she dwelt upon her action the more uneasy she became. Her vision clarified. All that had been hidden by her absurd prejudice and reasonless dislike--the soldier's frank and manly firmness, Lawson's <b>reproaches,</b> <b>her</b> aunt's open reproof--all these grew in power and significance as she mused.|$|E
6000|$|Husbands, don't {{love your}} wives any more. If they flirt with men younger or older than yourselves, let your blood not stir. If {{you can go}} away, go away. But if you must stay and see her, then say to her, [...] "I would rather you didn't flirt in my presence, Eleanora." [...] Then, when she goes red and loosens torrents of indignation, don't answer any more. And when she floods into tears, say quietly in your own self, [...] "My soul is my own"; and go away, be alone as much as possible. And when she works herself up, and says she must have love or she will die, then say: [...] "Not my love, however." [...] And to all her threats, her tears, her entreaties, her <b>reproaches,</b> <b>her</b> cajolements, her winsomenesses, answer nothing, but say to yourself: [...] "Shall I be implicated in this display of the love-will? Shall I be blasted by this false lightning?" [...] And though you tremble in every fiber, and feel sick, vomit-sick with the scene, still contain yourself, and say, [...] "My soul is my own. It shall not be violated." [...] And learn, learn, learn {{the one and only}} lesson worth {{learning}} at last. Learn to walk in the sweetness of the possession of your own soul. And whether your wife weeps as she takes off her amber beads at night, or whether your neighbor in the train sits in your coat bottoms, or whether your superior in the office makes supercilious remarks, or your inferior is familiar and impudent; or whether you read in the newspaper that Lloyd George is performing another iniquity, or the Germans plotting another plot, say to yourself: [...] "My soul is my own. My soul is with myself, and beyond implication." [...] And wait, quietly, in possession of your own soul, till you meet another man who has made the choice, and kept it. Then you will know him by the look on his face: half a dangerous look, a look of Cain, and half a look of gathered beauty. Then you two will make the nucleus of a new society--Ooray! Bis! Bis!! ...|$|E
