There are not <b>really</b> <b>any</b> other convenient places below the weight belt to add trim weights, so the most effective option is to carry the main weights as low as necessary, by using a suitable harness or integrated weight pocket buoyancy compensator which actually allows the weights to be placed correctly, so {{there is no need for}} longitudinal trimming.|$|E
25|$|Today, Pesach Sheni on the 14th of Iyar has {{the status}} of a very minor holiday (so much so that many of the Jewish people have never even heard of it, and it {{essentially}} does not exist outside of Orthodox and traditional Conservative Judaism). There are not <b>really</b> <b>any</b> special prayers or observances that are considered Jewish law. The only change in the liturgy is that in some communities Tachanun, a penitential prayer omitted on holidays, is not said. There is a custom, though not Jewish law, to eat just one piece of matzo on that night.|$|E

According to Ellefson, the original concept for the album's cover was very different, however, it was changed at the last minute. The title derives from a lyric in [...] "Use the Man".

500|$|Kathy and Tommy finally begin a relationship. Tommy {{explains}} to Kathy {{that he has}} been creating art in the hope that it will aid deferral. He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers tell them {{that there is no such}} thing as deferral, and that Tommy's artworks will not help him. They explain that the purpose of The Gallery was not to look into their souls but to investigate whether the [...] "all but human" [...] clones even have souls at all; Hailsham was the last place to consider the ethical implications of the donor scheme. As they take in the news on their return journey, Tommy breaks down in an explosion of rage and frustration, and he and Kathy cling to each other in grief. The film ends with Tommy dying on the operating table. Kathy is left alone, waiting for her donations which will begin in a month. Contemplating the ruins of her childhood, she asks in voice-over whether her fate is <b>really</b> <b>any</b> different from the people who will receive her organs; after all, [...] "we all complete".|$|E

These photographs were taken by Meisel. After the book was released, on October 22, 1992, MTV aired a special called The Day in Madonna, hosted by Kurt Loder (the title of this special was a pun of the title of the channel's daily show The Day in Rock), which profiled the release of Madonna's Sex and her album Erotica, even taking the book to the streets to allow people, including a sex therapist and group of real-life New York City dominatrices, to view it. MTV also interviewed many people who had viewed the book on the day of its release at the HMV music store in New York City. In celebration of the release of the book, the store held a Madonna look-alike contest and set up a booth where people could view the book for one dollar a minute, with all of the proceeds going to Lifebeat, the music industry organization founded to help fund AIDS research.|$|E
500|$|Wright {{wanted to}} write and direct a cop film because [...] "there isn't <b>really</b> <b>any</b> {{tradition}} of cop films in the UK... We felt that every {{other country in the}} world had its own tradition of great cop action films and we had none." [...] Wright and Pegg spent eighteen months writing the script. The first draft took eight months to develop, and after watching 138 cop-related films for dialogue and plot ideas and conducting over fifty interviews with police officers for research, the script was completed after another nine months. The title was based on the various two-word titles of action films in the 1980s and 1990s. In one interview Wright declared that he [...] "wanted to make a title that really had very little meaning...like Lethal Weapon and Point Break and Executive Decision." [...] In the same interview, Pegg joked that many action films' titles [...] "seem to be generated from two hats filled with adjectives and nouns and you just, 'Okay, that'll do.'" [...] While writing the script, the film's director and writer, Edgar Wright, as well as Pegg, intended to include Frost as the partner for Pegg's character. Frost revealed that he would do the film only if he could name his character, and he chose [...] "Danny Butterman".|$|E

[...] Bell wrote that [...] "seeing the judges debate behind-the-scenes kind of takes away the entire title", though she appreciated Lohan's Freaky Friday reference.

[...] He dismissed criticisms of the game as a [...] "Diablo clone," [...] arguing the gameplay is much deeper than such a comparison suggests. His only criticisms were some anti-climatic boss fights and repetitive music. He concluded [...] "There is honestly {{not a great deal}} to complain about here [...] Snowblind has put together one of the best engines on PS2 {{and one of the best}} hacks in the business, certainly the best a console has ever seen." [...] Kaiser Hwang scored the Xbox version 8.5 out of 10. He praised the graphics, but wrote [...] "What hurts this game's score is the fact that it is almost exactly the same game that was released last year, not that that's a bad thing. The game is a fine example of exceptional game-making. But an extra level or character, or <b>really</b> <b>any</b> added extras would've been great." [...] Fran Mirabella III scored the GameCube version 7.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a downgrade from the PS2 version." [...] He criticized the [...] "bafflingly destroyed frame rate," [...] and commented [...] "When it was released on the PS2 a year ago, few could believe what Snowblind had pulled off on Sony's stubborn console.

2500|$|Matthew Horton {{writing for}} Virgin Media praised Lewis for experimenting with dubstep on [...] "Come Alive" [...] and bubblegum pop on [...] "Shake You Up," [...] {{describing}} both songs as experiments that work. Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian newspaper {{picked up on}} the album's composition and described it as too heavily reliant on ballads, saying the issue was that it was [...] "an area where Adele now has the advantage." [...] However Sullivan did say that [...] "for once Lewis has made an album that's worth turning up – in parts, at least." [...] She praised [...] "Come Alive", [...] "Glassheart" [...] and [...] "Trouble". Fraser McAlpine from BBC Music gave the album a mixed review saying that Glassheart [...] "largely plays up to expectations". He criticised the subject matter, noting that many of the songs revisit familiar territory on how [...] "she is always unlucky in love, unless she is swooning in melancholy bliss." [...] McAlpine praised the production values, noting that [...] "over the course of these 12 songs {{there are all sorts of}} production nods to happier music" [...] but also pointing out that on most songs [...] " [...] sounds devastated." [...] In part [...] "its her natural tone of voice," [...] McAlpine concluded, as well as noting that there were not <b>really</b> <b>any</b> up-tempo songs, just songs that weren't ballads, but adding that it didn't matter as [...] "the songs that tend to fly best, on their own terms at least, are the uncluttered muscle ballads." [...] Commenting on [...] "Come Alive", he stated that although the [...] "breakbeat" [...] production is one of the [...] "happier" [...] ones on the album, Lewis sounds [...] "eternally downcast". The Independents Hugh Montgomery gave the album a mixed review, saying that [...] "obviously there's still swathes of antiseptic balladry best described as 'music to fold towels by'." [...] However, not all of his review was negative. Montgomery said the album attempted to make Lewis [...] "current again" [...] by including songs penned by Sandé, a [...] "Bond theme manqué" [...] and [...] "obviously and actually rather effectively, some dubstep." [...] Critics Robert Copsey and Lewis Corner from Digital Spy put Glassheart at number nine in their Top 20 albums of 2012, Copsey and Corner said that despite being renowned for ballads, [...] "it's the pacey numbers full of angst and torment that stand out." [...] Later in a poll of 25,000people, conducted by Digital Spy, readers voted Glassheart the fifth best album of 2012 with 9.8% share of the vote, behind Sandé's Our Version of Events, Babel by Mumford and Sons, Lana Del Rey's Born to Die and Fall to Grace by Paloma Faith.|$|E
