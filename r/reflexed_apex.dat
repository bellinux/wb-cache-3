5000|$|Leaves: Alternate, rarely opposite, often {{clustered}} at {{the ends}} of the branch, simple, three to five inches long, two to three wide, oval or ovate, wedge-shaped or rounded at base; margin is wavy toothed, slightly <b>reflexed,</b> <b>apex</b> acuminate. They come out of the bud involute, reddish green above, coated with silvery white tomentum beneath, when full grown are bright green above, pale, downy, almost white beneath. Feather-veined, midrib broad, yellowish, prominent beneath, with about six pairs of primary veins. In autumn they turn yellow, or yellow and scarlet. Petioles slender, grooved, hairy, with clasping bases.|$|E
5000|$|This {{variety is}} {{distinguishable}} from C. indica var. indica by having purple-red-margined leaves, purple-red fruits and slightly corm-like thickened terrestrial stem at the base. Additionally to this, there are normally two staminodes, recurved backwards, and the stamen is often strongly <b>reflexed</b> at the <b>apex.</b> These characteristics are fairly stable in this taxon. Sometimes, this variety is confused with C. discolor Lindl., {{from which it}} differs in much smaller, deep-red coloured flowers, short and slender rhizomes and chromosome numbers (2n=27 in C. discolor and 2n=18 in C. indica var. warszewiczii) ...|$|R
50|$|Trees to c. 10 m, {{or large}} shrubs. Stems often tinged red, villous-tomentose. Leaves {{minutely}} stipulate; petioles 5-11 cm, densely short villous, red; blades 8.5-15.5 × 6.5-14.5 cm, chartaceous, densely villous below, glabrescent above, turning red with age, palmately veined at base with 5-7 primary veins, the secondary venation reticulate, the base broadly cordate, the margins minutely denticulate, the apices acute to broadly short-acuminate.

30|$|Epiphytic or {{terrestrial}} plants. Pseudobulbs ovoid, usually {{round in}} cross-section, distributed on elongate creeping rhizome, sometimes caespitose, but clusters of pseudobulbs usually distantly remote along the rhizome, with 2 – 6 foliaceous bracts. Leaves 2 – 4 per pseudobulb, conduplicate, articulate. Inflorescence flexuose, usually very long, branched, branches with few to many flowers. Flowers resupinate, showy, white, yellow, pink, brown or purple. Floral bracts large, leafy. Tepals free, prominently unguiculate, similar {{in size and}} shape or petals much wider. Lip triangular to ovate rarely hastate to panduriform, <b>apex</b> <b>reflexed,</b> callus complex, often digitate, tuberculate or horned. Gynostemium gently sigmoid to erect, elongated, slender, clavate, usually forms right angles with lip. Anther subventral, incumbent, operculate, ellipsoid-ovoid. Pollinia 2, oblong ellipsoid, hard, unequally and deeply cleft, empty inside. Stigma large, elliptic, deeply concave. Rostellum short. Viscidium single, relatively large, elliptic, very thick, concave in {{the centre of the}} outer surface. Tegula single, very small, transversely elliptic-obtriangular, obscurely bilobulate at the apex, thin, lamellate. Rostellum remnant with oblique shallowly concave plate at the apex, canaliculate on the upper surface (Fig.  1). Capsule triangular.|$|R
60|$|General Appearance.--Capitulum {{laterally}} flat; length {{varies in}} proportion to the breadth; valves white, somewhat translucent, moderately thick, very smooth, but with faint traces of radiating lines; in some varieties, surface rather irregular along the zones of growth. Scuta without any internal teeth, and with scarcely any trace of the internal basal rim; upper angle little acuminated; the occludent margins of the two scuta stand rather separate from each other, showing a wide space of corium between them: these margins are arched and protuberant, but with the lower part a little hollowed out; basal margin a little curved. In one specimen alone, I saw a trace of a diagonal line of square coloured marks, like those common in L. anatifera. Terga rather broad, with the basal angle not much acuminated. The degree of prominence and outline of the double occludent margin varies very much. Carina, separated by a rather wide space from the scuta and terga; of very varying shape, the upper part not much acuminated, generally very flat, sometimes exteriorly marked by a central depressed line; never barbed; occasionally, (in a specimen from Australia,) middle part so wide as almost to become spoon-shaped; on the other hand occasionally of nearly the same width throughout; somewhat constricted above the fork. Fork deeply embedded as usual; situated, in fresh specimens, a little way beneath the basal margins of the scuta, instead of touching them, as in the other species; forks of varying width, not so abruptly inflected as in many species; sometimes much narrower than the upper widest part of the valve, sometimes nearly twice as wide; prongs of fork not very sharp, diverging at about a right angle, with the rim between them <b>reflexed.</b> The <b>apex</b> of the carina extends up between the terga for barely half their length, instead of up fully three fourths of their length, as in L. anatifera.|$|R
40|$|Perennial ± {{succulent}} herbs, often somewhat woody and procumbent and rooting at the base, often clothed with branched multicellular hairs; habit sometimes recalling certain Gesneriaceae (Cyrtandra, etc.). Leaves alternate, simple, mostly ± asymmetrical, sinuate-denticulate or subentire, ± fleshy, petiolate, exstipulate. Inflorescences axillary, cymose, often scorpioid, acropetal, solitary or 2 - 3 {{together in}} each axil. Bracts usually rather large and membranous. Flowers hermaphrodite (rarely unisexual), actinomorphic (calyx excepted), shortly pedicelled or sessile. Calyx-tube campanulate or linear-cylindric, adnate to the ovary {{by means of}} 5 longitudinal septa formed by {{the continuation of the}} filaments, leaving 5 deep nectariferous pits below the petals; lobes 5, imbricate, mostly membranous, persistent, unequal (2 larger and 3 smaller), coloured (mostly whitish). Corolla inserted at the apex of the calyx-tube, variously gamopetalous or less frequently choripetalous, ± campanulate, mostly fleshy or cartilagineous, occasionally delicate in texture, persistent, segments or petals 5 (rarely 4), valvate (sometimes induplicate), often <b>reflexed</b> at the <b>apex.</b> Stamens 5, alternipetalous, shortly adnate to the corolla (when gamopetalous); filaments persistent; anthers ovate, oblong or linear, introrse, basifixed, dehiscing by slits. Ovary inferior, 2 -locular; placentas axile, bifid, multi-ovulate; style short, thick, simple; stigma massive, oblongcylindric, often strongly 5 -ribbed. Ovules very minute, very numerous, pendulous, anatropous, with 1 integument. Fruit baccate, indehiscent. Seeds minute, ovoid; testa reticulate, brown; embryo minute; albumen copious. Distr. One genus. From Lower Burma, Indo-China and Kwangtung, throughout Malaysia to Central New Guinea-Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands excepted. Fig. 1...|$|R
30|$|Meanwhile, the phylogenetic {{placement}} of C. gynochthodes within Psydrax {{does not support}} the earlier suggestion of Bridson ([1985]) in placing the species under Pyrostria s.l.. Bridson may have assigned this SE Asian species under Pyrostria group B due to the presence of bracts which resembles that of Pyrostria although Baillon ([1879]) did not mention the occurrence of this character. However, we examined herbarium sheets of C. gynochthodes [Gaerlan, F.J.M 0542753 (L, PNH); Romero, E.M. 0542751 (L, PNH); Soejarto, D.D. 0219674 (L, PNH); Arriola and Alejandro, 12442 (PNH, USTH); Arriola and Alejandro, 11057 (PNH, USTH)] and revealed that bracts exist in younger inflorescences but totally absent in older ones. The presence of bracts on young inflorescences of C. gynochthodes will not affect its close relatedness with Psydrax. According to Bridson ([1987]) bracts may be present in some representatives of Psydrax, however, it is distinctive from the paired connate bracts of Pyrostria which are rare in Vanguerieae. The presence of bracts is not a cardinal character to delimit Psydrax. For instance, Bridson ([1985]) mentioned of the occurrence of bracts in the Indian Psydrax umbellata (Whit.) Bridson and unnamed Malayan species. Furthermore, examination of C. gynochthodes revealed that it posseses other diagnostic features of Psydrax such as coriaceous leaf blades, keeled stipules with truncate to triangular stipular base and falcate stipular <b>apex,</b> <b>reflexed</b> anthers, long style always exceeding the corolla tube, longer than wide stigmatic knob, cartilaginous seed and a very shallow to nearly inconspicuous apical crest without a lid-like area in the pyrene (Bridson [1985]; Cheek and Sonke [2004]). Additionally, the occurrence of a unique insertion of 40 bp in the trnL-F region of Psydrax that is non-alignable with other species of Vanguerieae (Lantz and Bremer [2004]) exists in C. gynochthodes.|$|R
