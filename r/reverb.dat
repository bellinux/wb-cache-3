5|$|The tone cabinet was {{originally}} the only method of adding reverberation to a Hammond organ; <b>reverb</b> was not fitted to older organs. The most commercially successful tone cabinets were probably the PR series, particularly the 40-watt PR40.|$|E
5|$|Although the xx {{had been}} {{strongly}} influenced by R acts, the album also drew comparisons from critics to alternative rock, electronica, and post-punk sounds. The melancholic songs on xx featured minimalist arrangements and were built around Smith's beats, Oliver Sim's basslines, and sparse guitar figures played by Baria Qureshi and Romy Madley Croft, who employed <b>reverb</b> in her lead guitar parts. Most of them were sung as low-key duets by Croft and Sim, both of whom wrote emotional lyrics about love, intimacy, loss, and desire.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the 73-note Stage Piano was {{introduced}} as a lighter and more portable {{alternative to the}} existing two-piece style, featuring four detachable legs (used in Fender steel pedal guitars), a sustain pedal and a single output jack. Although the Stage could be used with any amplifier, catalogs suggested {{the use of the}} Fender Twin <b>Reverb.</b> The older style piano continued to be sold alongside the Stage and was renamed the Suitcase Piano, with 88 note models also becoming available.|$|E
5000|$|Outboard effect units, such as compressors, <b>reverbs,</b> or equalizers. Compressors by Neve, Urei, Empirical Labs, DBX {{are widely}} used. De-essers include DBX 902. Noise gates include Drawmer DS 201. Equalizers include models by Neve and Urei. Effects include plate <b>reverbs,</b> spring <b>reverbs,</b> Roland Space Echo. Some studios stock a {{selection}} of major guitar pedals.|$|R
50|$|Variation effects include delays, echos, cross delays, early reflections, gate <b>reverbs,</b> reverse gate <b>reverbs,</b> rotary speakers, tremolo, auto-pan, phaser, distortion, overdrive, amp simulations, auto-wah, and equalizers.|$|R
50|$|Fender Twin <b>Reverbs</b> - Used most recently.|$|R
5|$|Ranaldo {{used his}} {{signature}} Fender Jazzmaster guitar during the recording sessions of Between the Times and the Times and a custom-built electric guitar by Jarrell Guitars. Several Martin and Gibson acoustic guitars were used, including a Martin D-35, Martin 00018, Gibson J-50and Gibson J-45. Various equipment—such as Fender Prosonic and Fender Super <b>Reverb</b> amplifiers, Ibanez Analog Delay, Voodoo Lab Sparkle Drive, BJF Electronics' Honey Bee and DOD Two Second Digital Delay effects pedals—was {{used during the}} recording sessions {{to contribute to the}} album's sound.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn {{began his}} {{professional}} film career directing commercials and music videos, and became {{associated with the}} film production company Warp X. He served as Second Unit Director on the film <b>Reverb.</b> Blackburn co-wrote and directed Donkey Punch, which was his first film to be shown at the Sundance Film Festival. He shot the film on a £1 million budget over 24 days in South Africa. Movie critics likened {{his work on the}} film to filmmaker Peter Berg's Very Bad Things, director Phillip Noyce's Dead Calm, and Roman Polanski's Knife in the Water. He went on to serve as writer for the film Vinyan, which critics compared to two films by director Nicolas Roeg, Don't Look Now and Heart of Darkness.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{pop music}} {{developed}} concurrently with experimental jazz {{as a new}} kind of avant-garde, with many younger musicians embracing the practice of making studio recordings along the fringes of popular music. In the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural <b>reverb,</b> and other sound effects, and by the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or sounds that expanded the idea of the typical popular song, was positively received by young audiences. Throughout the ensuing decades, some purveyors of the style shared a literary-experimental tradition that balanced experimentation with populist cohesion.|$|E
25|$|The Impulse Response Utility is used {{to create}} custom {{convolution}} <b>reverbs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The plugins include equalizers, noise removal plugins, <b>reverbs,</b> {{analog filter}} banks emulators, {{compressors}} and psychoacoustic effects.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Reverb's</b> profile {{extends to}} the {{international}} arena. Its sub-publisher network {{is a mix of}} corporates and independents.|$|R
5|$|Lynch {{worked with}} Alan Splet {{to design the}} film's sound. The pair {{arranged}} and fabricated soundproof blanketing to insulate their studio, where they spent almost a year creating and editing the film's sound effects. The soundtrack is densely layered, including as many as fifteen different sounds played simultaneously using multiple reels. Sounds were created {{in a variety of}} ways—for a scene in which a bed slowly dissolves into a pool of liquid, Lynch and Splet inserted a microphone inside a plastic bottle, floated it in a bathtub, and recorded the sound of air blown through the bottle. After being recorded, sounds were further augmented by alterations to their pitch, <b>reverb</b> and frequency.|$|E
5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight <b>reverb</b> effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, Jack {{displayed}} a continued partiality towards amps and pedals from the 1960s. Jack used {{a number of}} effects to create his sound, such as a DigiTech Whammy IV to reach pitches that would be otherwise impossible with a regular guitar. When performing live, Jack used a Randy Parsons custom guitar, a 1964 JB Hutto Montgomery Airline, a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s Crestwood Astral II, and a 1950s Kay Hollowbody. Also, while playing live, he used an MXR Micro-Amp, Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi distortion/sustainer, and an Electro-Harmonix POG (a polyphonic octave generator). He also used a Boss TU-2 tuner pedal. He plugged this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin <b>Reverb,</b> and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 1485 amplifiers paired with two 6x10 Silvertone cabinets. In addition to standard guitar tuning, Jack also used several open tunings.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Reverbs</b> - <b>Reverbs</b> {{are used}} to {{simulate}} boundary reflections created in a real room, adding a sense of space and depth to otherwise 'dry' recordings. Another use is to distinguish among auditory objects; all sound having one reverberant character will be categorized together by human hearing in a process called auditory streaming. This is an important feature in layering sound, in depth, from {{in front of the}} speaker to behind it.|$|R
50|$|AIR also {{contributes}} <b>reverbs,</b> dynamics, modulation and other effects {{as part of}} the Pro Tools, all of these work in native format only.|$|R
5000|$|Super <b>Reverbs</b> {{produced}} between late 1980 and 1981 have blackface {{cosmetics and}} a silver sparkle grille cloth but the same circuitry as prior years.|$|R
25|$|Electronic effects units such as delay, <b>reverb,</b> octave, equalizer, chorus, etc.|$|E

50|$|In the {{recording}} studio he records with microphones and additional effects. Along with the Godin Multiac MIDI guitar he uses a Roland GR-series synthesizer, Lexicon Jamman, and Lexicon and Alesis <b>reverbs.</b>|$|R
25|$|His {{effects are}} {{numerous}} and spanning several pedalboards and racks, but important staples are his DigiTech Whammy pedal for pitch effects, and delays and <b>reverbs</b> from various Eventide pedals and the TC Electronic 2290 Digital Delay.|$|R
50|$|Prior to his Peavey endorsement, Rossington {{would use}} Fender Twins and Fender Super <b>Reverbs</b> loaded with Jensen speakers, Marshall Plexis with speaker {{cabinets}} loaded with Celestion Greenbacks, and Hiwatt amps with speaker cabinets loaded with Fane speakers.|$|R

These plug-ins {{are also available}} in a PowerCore version (some of them are ported from the System 6000). They include vocal harmonisers, mastering plugins, <b>reverbs</b> and compressors.|$|R
5000|$|Memphis also {{designed}} and manufactured guitar effects pedals, including delays, <b>reverbs,</b> overdrive, and the Memphis Fuzz. One {{of the most}} common is the Memphis Phaser, simply named [...] "Roto Phase" [...] - a simple pedal with input, output, and one knob that controlled the speed.|$|R
25|$|Parker's {{music is}} heavily {{influenced}} by psychedelic rock, which is achieved through various production methods. Some favoured and often-used effects by Parker include phasing, delay, <b>reverb</b> and fuzz.|$|E

5000|$|In 2015, {{previous}} {{recordings and}} demos by Cammell's band surfaced online (most notably {{of the song}} [...] "Make A Chain") which led to Cammell forming a new band named Cami & The <b>Reverbs,</b> and playing sporadic shows across Liverpool including a support slot with Liverpool group Rain.|$|R
5000|$|Ryan does wicked {{things with}} the violin. He plays <b>reverbs,</b> delays and wahs on it. It's another instrument, it's not a violin anymore. It's like another guitar. It gives us the Blue in Blue October. Without him {{it would be much}} less moody, and I love moody.|$|R
