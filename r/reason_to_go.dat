[...] The show deals with the theme of death, which Tsamere said is [...] "a bit strange, but it has the virtue of attracting the public's attention". He said that he and his co-authors thought that [...] "the most irrefutable <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on stage ... was to talk about something strong".

[...] After his accident on lap twelve, Romain Grosjean spoke of his [...] "biggest impact for quite a while".

500|$|The {{sequences}} on the Grid were wholly shot in 3D, utilizing cameras {{specifically designed}} for it, and employed a 3D technique that combined other special effects techniques. The real-world sequences were filmed in 2D, and eventually altered using the three-dimensional element. Bailey stated {{that it was a}} challenge shooting Tron: Legacy in 3D because the cameras were bigger and heavier, and variations needed to be taken into account. Despite these concerns, he opined that it was a [...] "great <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the movies because it's an experience you just can't recreate on an iPhone or a laptop". In some sequences the image shows a fine mesh pattern and some blurring. That is not interference or a production fault, but indicates that that sequence is a flashback and to simulate an older form of video representation technology. Stunt work on the film was designed and coordinated by 87Eleven, who also designed and trained fight sequences for 300 and Watchmen. Olivia Wilde described it as an honor to train with them.|$|E
500|$|Following the film's release, Zoya Akhtar {{expressed}} {{an idea to}} make a sequel of the film. Speaking about it, she said [...] "You never know, I might or may not make a sequel. It {{all depends on the}} right content." [...] It has been reported that the characters are expected to reprise their roles in the sequel, if it is officially launched. In an interview with the Hindustan Times, Hrithik {{expressed an}} idea for the basic plot of the sequel. He said that it could be set five years after ZNMD and that the original characters would have grown older, having a <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on another trip. It has also been agreed upon that a proper script is required, as it is {{not a part of the}} [...] "commercial field" [...] of cinema. However, no official confirmations have been made regarding the sequel, despite requests from many viewers. After the IIFA ceremony, Farhan Akhtar commented that there was [...] "no necessity" [...] for the sequel. Later in 2013, in an interview with Hindustan Times, Zoya Akhtar expressed interest in scripting for the sequel after completing the shooting of her next film Dil Dhadakne Do released in June 2015.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} a sequel to [...] was decided, most of the staff of Lucasfilm Games was {{occupied}} with other projects such as The Secret of Monkey Island and The Dig. Designer Hal Barwood had only created two computer games on his own before, but {{was put in charge}} of the project because of his experience as a producer and writer of feature films. The company originally wanted him to create a game based on Indiana Jones and the Monkey King/Garden of Life, a rejected script written by Chris Columbus for the third movie that would have seen Indiana looking for Chinese artifacts in Africa. However, after reading the script Barwood decided that the idea was substandard, and requested to create an original story for the game instead. Along with co-worker Noah Falstein, he visited the library of George Lucas' workplace Skywalker Ranch to look for possible plot devices. They eventually decided upon Atlantis when they looked at a diagram in [...] "some cheap coffee-table book on the world's unsolved mysteries", which depicted the city as built in three concentric circles. Falstein and Barwood originally considered the mythical sword Excalibur as the story's plot device, but the idea was scrapped because it wouldn't have easily given Indiana Jones a <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> anywhere except England.|$|E

Similar disparities were predicted by the Yoshioka MonteCarlo simulation study (Yoshioka et al. 1987, 1988). Other possible explanations for the discrepancy between the literature values and those predicted by the LNISO method might be: 1) differences in experimental conditions such as pH shift upon increase of temperature by the non-isothermal, buffer concentration, temperature control, etc. 2) differences in sensitivity of the analytical tools (Koshy and Lach 1961; Meakin et al. 1971). It is unfortunate that we did not perform our own isothermal study to address any differences but we were unable for logistical <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> perform such a study but as will be seen with the Allergan compounds, similar differences were seen between the two stability testing methods.|$|R

I might {{have thought it was}} a kind of pony for all I know, but I don't remember being disappointed." [...] Four years later, Autumn made her musical debut as a solo violinist performing with an orchestra, and won a competition. At the age of nine or ten, she left regular school with the goal of becoming a world-class violinist. On her time at the school, she remarked, [...] "I hated it anyway, what with the status as 'weird,' 'antisocial,' and the physical threats, there seemed to be no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> anymore, so I just didn't." [...] She practiced eight or nine hours a day, had lessons, read a wide range of literature, participated in orchestra practice, and was home-schooled. Growing up, she owned a large CD collection of [...] "violin concertos, symphonies, chamber music, opera, and a little jazz". She began writing her own music and poetry at age thirteen or fourteen, though she never planned to sing any of her songs. She studied under various teachers and attended Indiana University in Bloomington, but left after two years there, because she disagreed with the prevailing views on individuality and classical music. She believed that neither the audience nor the original composer would be insulted by the clothing and appearance of the performer.|$|E

The 'feed them, don't fight them' policy in dealing with Utes was unable to be sustained indefinitely. Because in 1849 Chief Walker offered the ground to the settlers, they believed the land now belonged to them.|$|R
