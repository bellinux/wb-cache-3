2500|$|Ideally the {{delivered}} {{pressure is}} equal to the resting pressure in the diver's lungs as this is what human lungs are adapted to breathe. With a twin hose regulator behind the diver at shoulder level, the delivered pressure changes with diver orientation. if the diver rolls on his or her back the <b>released</b> <b>air</b> pressure is higher than in the lungs. Divers learned to restrict flow by using their tongue to close the mouthpiece. When the cylinder pressure was running low and air demand effort rising, a roll to the right side made breathing easier. The mouthpiece can be purged by lifting it above [...] the regulator(shallower), which will cause a free flow.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mayor of}} Dish, Texas complained that air {{pollution}} from a natural gas compressor station was sickening his family. However, in May 2010, The Texas Department of State Health Services <b>released</b> <b>air</b> quality results for DISH, including tests {{of blood and}} urine samples from 28 DISH residents that were tested for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The agency concluded: “The information obtained from this investigation did not indicate that community-wide exposures from gas wells or compressor stations were occurring in the sample population. This conclusion {{was based on the}} pattern of VOC values found in the samples. Other sources of exposure such as cigarette smoking, the presence of disinfectant by-products in drinking water, and consumer or occupational/hobby related products could explain many of the findings.” ...|$|E
2500|$|After docking and leak checks were conducted, the ISS {{crew was}} able to enter the {{pressurised}} cargo module and access the ATV's cargo. Jules Vernes liquid tanks were connected to the ISS, and their contents were transferred to the station. The crew manually <b>released</b> <b>air</b> components directly into the ISS's atmosphere. The ISS crew gradually replaced the ATV's cargo with waste for disposal. In total, [...] of water, [...] of oxygen and [...] of propellant {{was transferred to the}} Zvezda module, and Jules Verne was also used to reboost the space station on four occasions. About [...] of dry cargo was removed from the ATV and remained aboard the ISS. In addition, two original manuscripts by Jules Verne, as well as an illustrated French edition of Pierre-Jules Hetzel's From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon, were delivered to the crew of the ISS by the ATV.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003 California’s South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) filed a {{complaint}} against BP/ARCO, seeking $319 million in penalties for thousands of air pollution violations over an 8-year period. [...] In January 2005, the agency filed a second suit against BP based on violations between August 2002 and October 2004. [...] The suit alleged that BP illegally <b>released</b> <b>air</b> pollutants by failing to adequately inspect, maintain, repair and properly operate thousands of pieces of equipment across the refinery as required by AQMD regulations. [...] It was alleged {{that in some cases}} the violations were due to negligence, while in others the violations were knowingly and willfully committed by refinery officials. In 2005 a settlement was reached under which BP agreed to pay $25 million in cash penalties and $6 million in past emissions fees, while spending $20 million on environmental improvements at the refinery and $30 million on community programs focused on asthma diagnosis and treatment.|$|E

50|$|Dissolved air {{flotation}} (DAF) is a {{water treatment process}} that clarifies wastewaters (or other waters) by the removal of suspended matter such as oil or solids. The removal is achieved by dissolving air in the water or wastewater under pressure and then releasing the air at atmospheric pressure in a flotation tank basin. The <b>released</b> <b>air</b> forms tiny bubbles which adhere to the suspended matter causing the suspended matter to float {{to the surface of}} the water where it may then be removed by a skimming device.|$|E

50|$|When {{the valve}} is <b>released,</b> <b>air</b> will {{flow from the}} balloon at higher {{pressure}} to the balloon at lower pressure. The lower pressure balloon will expand. Figure 2 (above left) shows a typical initial configuration: the smaller balloon has the higher pressure. So, when the valve is opened, the smaller balloon pushes air into the larger balloon. It becomes smaller, and the larger balloon becomes larger. The air flow ceases when the two balloons have equal pressure, with {{one on the left}} branch of the pressure curve (r<rp) and one on the right branch (r>rp).|$|E
5000|$|In {{preparation}} for each mission, weather reports are carefully analyzed {{in order to}} ensure that the nuclear test will not affect commercial air lanes when the [...] "mushroom cloud" [...] is <b>released.</b> <b>Air</b> bursts are also studied by a fleet of over 40 aircraft that collect samples of the air in the drop zone as well as surrounding areas. Data is sent back to the radiological command center. After each flight, all aircraft used in trailing and sampling are washed down to decontaminate the aircraft and return them to service within a 24-hour period.|$|E
50|$|The Cineston {{evolved from}} the rotary {{controllers}} used to control the power delivered to the electric traction motors in early mass transit systems. In early systems, notably those found in trams, the motor control was operated by the left hand, and the brakes by the right hand. Typically the brake lever also included a dead man's switch that <b>released</b> <b>air</b> pressure to activate the air brakes in an emergency. In the Cineston, motor control and brake controls are combined in a single lever's rotary motion, and the dead man's switch is implemented in a vertical motion.|$|E
50|$|An inline {{blowback}} {{is a type}} of blowback design. A blowback marker is {{one that}} when the trigger is pulled, the sear is released, which allows the striker, which is linked to the bolt, to slam into the valve, which <b>releases</b> <b>air</b> into the bolt, which is redirected out the barrel. The valve also <b>releases</b> <b>air</b> back into the striker, pushing it back and recocking the marker. An inline blowback is where the bolt, striker, and valve are all adjacent horizontally in the same tube, instead of in a stacked tube blowback where the valve and striker are in one tube, and the bolt is in another tube above the valve and striker.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} the whole Networker fleet, wheel slide {{protection}} (WSP) operates on every axle.

50|$|In late 1931 the Air Ministry <b>released</b> <b>Air</b> Ministry {{specification}} F.7/30.

It was {{made clear that the}} evaporatively-cooled Rolls-Royce Goshawk was the preferred engine. The best-known outcome of this specification was the crank-winged Supermarine Type 224 monoplane with an open cockpit and fixed undercarriage designed by R.J. Mitchell. Bristol submitted several biplane designs, none of which brought an order for a prototype, but they were invited to offer a private-venture aircraft.|$|E

Over time, Kesmai produced many improved versions of the game. In 1997, a backport from Windows to the Macintosh was made available as an open beta on the Internet. In 1999, Kesmai was purchased by Electronic Arts, which started running the game servers itself. The last Air Warrior servers were shut down on December 7, 2001.|$|E

Then a loud crack of <b>released</b> <b>air</b> pressure accompanies a sudden blackout of the room, with the only illumination coming from small strobes under the section of track on which the train is held which has suddenly dropped around 30 cm. After a pause of around two seconds, the track and train freefall five metres.

5000|$|Critical acclaim {{followed}} the film's premiere as Air Force echoed {{some of the}} emotional issues that underlay the American public psyche at the time, including fears of Japanese Americans.

[...] When seen in a modern perspective, the emotional aspects of the film seem out of proportion, and although it has been wrongly dismissed as a piece of wartime propaganda, it still represents a classic war film that can be considered a historical document. When initially <b>released,</b> <b>Air</b> Force was one of the top three films in commercial revenue in 1943.|$|E
