5|$|Banister {{attended}} La Marque High School in La Marque, Texas. At La Marque, Banister {{played for}} the school's baseball, basketball, and American football teams. During his sophomore year of high school, Banister injured his <b>right</b> <b>ankle</b> while playing baseball. During an examination of his ankle, which was slow to heal, {{he was diagnosed with}} bone cancer. He had developed cysts that required skin grafting to treat. An infection in his leg {{led to the development of}} osteomyelitis, which spread from his <b>right</b> <b>ankle</b> to just below his knee. Doctors recommended amputation in order to save the rest of his leg, but Banister refused, as he hoped he would be able to continue his baseball career. Doctors performed seven operations on his leg, which saved it from being amputated. In his senior year, Banister suffered a knee injury playing American football, which nearly led to him being cut from the baseball team due to his decreased mobility. His father suggested he change positions and become a catcher, which allowed him to remain on the baseball team.|$|E

5|$|Davis was not re-signed by the Eagles {{following}} the 1995 season {{and became an}} unrestricted free agent. He worked out for the Atlanta Falcons on April 25, 1996. After disagreeing on {{the terms of the}} contract, Davis signed with the Falcons on May 13 and agreed to a two-year contract worth $1.9 million. The contract contained a $200,000 signing bonus and a $300,000 workout bonus to go along with a $1.4 million base salary, and up to $300,000 in incentives based on playing time. He began the 1996 season as a backup behind David Richards at right tackle. Davis started in place of the injured Richards for a week five game against the San Francisco 49ers on September 29. Richards came back from his injury in week six, but he and Davis split playing time in weeks seven and eight against the Houston Oilers and Dallas Cowboys, respectively. Richards was waived on October 23 by the Falcons, who decided to go with Davis at right tackle {{for the remainder of the}} year. Davis suffered a <b>right</b> <b>ankle</b> sprain in a week sixteen game against the St. Louis Rams on December 15.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{amount and}} {{intensity}} of people's activities are related to latent chronic diseases and the aging process. Accurate information about people's patterns of activity in their natural environments {{would go a long}} way toward understanding the relationship between types/levels of activity and health. Unlike the commercially available activity monitors, an algorithm developed at Boston University utilizes frequency (cycles/second) to identify overground gait and pedaling. These studies evaluate the validity of this system in a real-life environment and then investigate people's locomotive behavior across weekdays of the same week. METHODS: Wearing the monitoring system developed at BU on their <b>right</b> <b>ankles,</b> 16 older adults performed a battery of functional locomotive activities continuously in a residential setting, while being video recorded for reference. For the validity algorithm output regarding gait and pedaling variables was statistically compared to the video analysis of the same using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). To investigate the consistency of locomotor behavior across weekdays of the same week, 227 older adults wore the monitoring system under study on their <b>right</b> <b>ankles</b> continuously for a week. Daily gait and pedaling values were correlated across weekdays of the same week also using ICCs. An investigation into the differences in gait variability for the average of 3 weekdays according to the subgroups; age, gender, and BMI was conducted on this sample using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. RESULTS: Three of the four gait validity ICCs were significant (p ≤ 0. 019) ranging from 0. 267 to 0. 778. All pedaling validity variables had ICCs ≥ 0. 993 The locomotive consistency study found all 6 daily gait variables significantly (p < 0. 001) correlated across 3 weekdays, ranging from 0. 534 to 0. 914. Three of four ICCs for pedaling consistency variables were significant (p ≤ 0. 029) ranging from 0. 277 to 0. 838. CONCLUSIONS: This study's validity results support this monitoring system's gait and pedaling identification approach. There is also evidence to suggest how the system could improve its real-life locomotive detection validity and potentially diversify its applications. Additionally, based on this dissertation's results, some of people's daily locomotive behaviors remain relatively constant over weekdays during the same week...|$|R

5|$|Following the Belgian Grand Prix on 27 August, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a four-day testing {{session at the}} Monza circuit and concentrated on optimising their car set-ups for low downforce. Jos Verstappen set the quickest times on the first day, ahead of Pedro Diniz. Coulthard was quickest on the second day. Fisichella suffered a high speed crash going into the Ascari chicane, bringing a brief halt to testing. He visited Rome to undergo a medical examination and was diagnosed with an inflamed tendon in his <b>right</b> <b>ankle,</b> but was cleared to race having been advised to take five days of rest. Jacques Villeneuve set the quickest times {{on the third day}} as rain shortened the team's running. Minardi's Gastón Mazzacane suffered a high speed accident at the Ascari chicane, forcing testing to be stopped. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the fourth and final day of testing. Michael Schumacher's car developed a malfunction and pulled off the race track, limiting Ferrari's testing time as the car's power unit was changed.|$|E
5|$|His feet {{position}} were peculiar in {{that his}} front foot was {{parallel to the}} crease and his back foot perpendicular, {{the opposite of the}} conventional posture. This inhibited his follow through and put more stress on his ankles and shins. As a result, his <b>right</b> <b>ankle</b> had to be bound tightly in order to prevent jarring from his awkward delivery. He also followed the recommendation of Bill O'Reilly and tied a towel around his shins to cut off the circulation and to dull the pain. After the knee injury, he altered his action into a more conventional one so that his front foot pointed towards the batsman. This eased the pressure on his body, but his ability to move the ball diminished. Johnston was a keen student of the game, and although he did not see a state match until his debut, and watched only one Test before his debut, he supplemented his knowledge by reading cricket books. During his early first-class career, upon returning from matches, he would read articles by Bradman, Bert Oldfield and Arthur Mailey from a book given to him by his schoolteacher when he was a schoolboy.|$|E
5|$|The {{day before}} the match, Avram Grant {{predicted}} that the game would throw up few tactical surprises due to the two teams' knowledge of each other from the domestic league. Nevertheless, he decided to start with Florent Malouda on the left-wing instead of Salomon Kalou, and also chose to deploy Michael Essien at right-back, rather than in his preferred midfield position, ahead of Paulo Ferreira – who did not even make the bench despite starting both legs of the semi-final – and Juliano Belletti. The rest of Chelsea's team was as expected, with key players John Terry (dislocated elbow) and Didier Drogba (knee) recovering from injuries suffered against Bolton Wanderers {{on the last day}} of the league season 10 days earlier to start the game. Ashley Cole also started despite hurting his <b>right</b> <b>ankle</b> in training the {{day before the}} game under a heavy challenge from Claude Makélélé. His replacement would have likely been Wayne Bridge, but he recovered sufficiently that Bridge was not even included in the matchday squad as cover.|$|E

30|$|Another key {{application}} is vital data collection for workers such as firefighters, soldiers, {{and police officers}} in an urgent/life-critical scenario and for athletes in a sports-training scenario. For the former scenario, {{it is essential to}} monitor in real-time their physical and physiological states through collecting vital data from sensor nodes: body temperature meter, electro-cardio-graph (ECG), electro-myo-graph (EMG), tri-accelerometer, and SpO 2 meter (for oxygen saturation) put on various positions of their bodies: left and right arms, left and <b>right</b> <b>ankles,</b> chest, finger and so on. On the other hand, for the latter scenario, {{it is also important to}} collect vital data in real-time, since trainers can train athletes with feedback information on their physical states. For the application, high reliability such as low packet error rate and low packet delay is the most important factor, in other words, because of their short operating times, the energy consumption of sensor nodes is not so critical. In this paper, we pay attention to how to guarantee high reliability in a WBAN.|$|R

5|$|During Game 1 of the 2012 ALCS, Jeter {{broke his}} <b>right</b> <b>ankle</b> while {{attempting}} to field a ball. He {{was one of many}} Yankees to miss playing time during the club's 2013 campaign; 20 players were placed on the disabled list at least once. The team had an opportunity to win a wild-card playoff spot, but faded late in the season. It was only the second time since 1995 that New York did not qualify for postseason play. In the offseason, second baseman Robinson Canó departed New York for the Mariners in free agency, but the Yankees signed starting pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, who was coming off a 24–0 year with Japan's Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, to a seven-year contract. Rodriguez was suspended for the 2014 season by MLB for using performance-enhancing drugs. The 2014 Yankees, the last with Jeter in their lineup, fell four games short of a postseason berth with an 84–78 record. Despite signing several new hitters prior to the season, the team finished third from last in the AL in runs scored. The offense improved in 2015, ending the regular season with the second-most runs in MLB. New York gained a wild card berth with a second-place finish, but was defeated by the Houston Astros in a one-game playoff. The Yankees traded several veteran players during their 2016 season, and Rodriguez was released from his contract. The club had 84 wins, but missed the playoffs {{for the third time in}} four years. As the Yankees' on-field performance declined after 2009, their attendance and television ratings fell; revenue from ticket and luxury suite sales at Yankee Stadium decreased by more than 40percent from 2009 to 2016.|$|E
5|$|Kariya and Selänne joined {{an already}} high-powered Avalanche team that {{included}} such forwards as Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg, Milan Hejduk and Alex Tanguay. Despite {{high expectations for}} the duo's reunion, Kariya and Selänne both struggled in their sole years with Colorado. After beginning the 2003–04 season on a line with Selänne centred by Joe Sakic, Kariya suffered a sprained right wrist {{in a game against}} the Boston Bruins on October 21, 2003. After being sidelined for ten games, he returned in mid-November, but re-injured his wrist in his first contest back. Due to the injury, Kariya missed playing against the Ducks {{for the first time in}} a home game on November 18. Still recovering a month later, he remained sidelined for a return to Anaheim's Arrowhead Pond on December 20. Kariya's departure from the Ducks drew criticism from his previous team's fans. In anticipation of the Avalanche-Ducks game on December 20, Anaheim fans began a fund that raised over $1,200 to be given to the favourite charity of the Ducks player who scores the game-winning goal against Colorado. The idea was precipitated by reports that Kariya had given Selänne $3,000 for scoring the game-winning goal against the Ducks on November 18 (it is an informal tradition in the NHL for players to offer rewards to teammates who score against former teams). Kariya returned to the Avalanche lineup in time for their next game against the Ducks on January 13, 2004, at the Pepsi Center. He scored one goal in a 3–1 win. Later that month, he played his first game against the Ducks in Anaheim on January 30. Booed every time he touched puck, he recorded two assists, as the Avalanche lost 4–3 in overtime. Limited by injuries, Kariya scored below his career pace with 11 goals and 36 points over 51 games. Selänne recorded 32 points, while playing in 78 games. In the final game of the regular season, Kariya injured his <b>right</b> <b>ankle</b> against the Nashville Predators on April 4. As a team, Colorado lost their division for the first time in nine years to the Vancouver Canucks. Qualifying for the 2004 playoffs as the fourth seed in the West, they lost in the second round to the Sharks. Kariya returned to the Colorado lineup in time for Game 6 against the Sharks, recording an assist as the Avalanche were eliminated by a score of 3–1.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the use of Zero Moment Point (ZMP) concept for {{balancing}} control of the Asian Institute of Technology Leg EXoskeleton-I (ALEX-I). ALEX-I has been developed to assist patients who suffer from paraplegia or immobility due to the loss of power on lower limbs. The balanced posture set-points (joint trajectories) under ZMP criterion are generated offline. The ZMP based set points are provided as the desired postures to ALEX-I. Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) determines the modified set points based on postures balancing sensed by loadcells. Ground Contact Point (GCP) is used to find the "ZMP-like in real time". GCP data is obtained by placing 4 loadcells forming a force plate on each foot of ALEX-I. This GCP data is then compared with the reference ZMP. Uncertainties of the model parameters, backlash, and joint tolerance are considered as disturbance. The differences of ZMP and GCP on x-z plane are used as the inputs to the FLC. The 4 outputs from FLC are the compensated angles of left and <b>right</b> <b>ankles</b> joints in roll and pitch axes that make the actual ZMP locate in the convex hull of the supporting area...|$|R
