5|$|Because Lynott {{had worked}} {{alongside}} Smith at the Rainbow Pub, West Midlands Police wished to re-examine {{the cause of}} her death. In early 2001, investigators asked the Irish authorities for a new post mortem, and on 8 March Lynott's body was exhumed by Gardai from a cemetery in Athlone and taken to Dublin City Morgue for further examination by Ireland's State Pathologist, Dr John Harbison. However, the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> autopsy also proved inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, {{which is the most}} common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, thickening of the heart muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E
5|$|On 29 March 2008, Zimbabwe held {{a presidential}} {{election}} along with a parliamentary election. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> election were withheld for two weeks, after which it was generally acknowledged that the Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai (MDC-T) had achieved a majority of one seat in the lower house of parliament.|$|E
2500|$|As a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> redefinition, Einstein also {{redefined the}} concept of [...] "inertia" [...] in terms of {{geodesic}} deviation instead, with some subtle but significant additional implications. The <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is that, according to general relativity, inertia is the gravitational coupling between matter and spacetime.|$|R

5|$|Soon after this, Hasbro {{hosted a}} meeting with Hama, Jim Shooter, Tom DeFalco, Archie Goodwin, and Nelson Yomtov to discuss {{the future of the}} property. It was at this meeting that Goodwin {{suggested}} the idea of Cobra Command as a recurring enemy for G.I. Joe to fight (similar to the HYDRA terrorist organization - recurring enemies to the aforementioned S.H.I.E.L.D. organization). Prior to this, Hasbro had not considered giving G.I. Joe an enemy. Based on the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> meeting, Hasbro contracted Marvel to produce a comic book series featuring the toys.|$|E
5|$|The FEFAP field surveys, {{excavations}} and exhumations spanned {{more than}} 10years. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study from King William Island and Beechey Island artefacts and human remains {{showed that the}} Beechey Island crew had most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, which was suggested by the evidence of Pott's disease discovered in Braine. Toxicological reports pointed to lead poisoning as a likely contributing factor. Blade cut marks found on bones {{from some of the}} crew were seen as signs of cannibalism. Evidence suggested that a combination of cold, starvation and disease including scurvy, pneumonia and tuberculosis, all made worse by lead poisoning, killed everyone in the Franklin party.|$|E
5|$|The TRACERx {{project is}} looking at how NSCLC {{develops}} and evolves, and how these tumors become resistant to treatment. The project will look at tumor samples from 850 NSCLC patients at various stages including diagnosis, after first treatment, post-treatment, and relapse. By studying samples at different points of tumor development, the researchers hope to identify the changes that drive tumor growth and resistance to treatment. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> project will help scientists and doctors {{gain a better understanding}} of NSCLC and potentially lead to the development of new treatments for the disease.|$|E
