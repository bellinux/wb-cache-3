According to background materials prepared for the workshop, more than 30 federal negotiated <b>rulemakings</b> occurred between 1996 and 2005, including the No Child Left Behind Act, Off-Road Vehicle Regulations at Cape Cod National Seashore, and Worker Safety Standards for the Use of Cranes and Derricks in Construction.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} Final 2012 Effluent Guidelines Program Plan (“Final 2012 Plan”) and the Preliminary 2014 Effluent Guidelines Program Plan (“Preliminary 2014 Plan”), {{both of which}} were prepared pursuant to Clean Water Act (CWA) section 304 (m). It also provides a summary of EPA’s review of effluent guidelines and pretreatment standards, consistent with CWA sections 301 (d), 304 (b), 304 (g), and 304 (m), and EPA’s evaluation of indirect discharges without categorical pretreatment standards to identify potential new categories for pretreatment standards under CWA section 307 (b). From these reviews, the Plans identify any new or existing industrial categories selected for effluent guidelines <b>rulemakings,</b> and provide a schedule for such <b>rulemakings.</b> In addition, the Plans present any new or existing categories selected for further review and analysis...|$|R

5|$|Starting in 1738, {{towns in}} New Jersey began issuing liquor {{licenses}} to tavern keepers. Before federal Prohibition in 1919, despite many state liquor statutes, {{the regulation of}} alcoholic beverages in New Jersey was almost exclusively local, with wide variations among municipalities. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the states were again permitted to regulate alcoholic beverages. Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933, New Jersey instituted the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, which established and granted <b>rulemaking</b> powers to the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. The law also established a three-tier alcohol distribution system whereby, with minor exceptions, alcohol manufacturers may only sell to wholesalers, who may only sell to retailers, who may only sell to customers.|$|E

25|$|The next {{document}} issued was a proposed rule dated June 17, 1994, which states, “FDA is issuing a notice of proposed <b>rulemaking</b> {{in the form}} of an amended tentative final monograph that would establish conditions under which OTC topical health-care antiseptic drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. FDA is issuing this notice of proposed <b>rulemaking</b> on topical antimicrobial drug products after considering the public comments on that notice and other information in the administrative record for this <b>rulemaking.</b> FDA is also requesting data and information concerning the safety and effectiveness of topical antimicrobials for use as hand sanitizers or dips.” In the 1994 update to the rule, TCS was effectively removed from the drug category which made it available for use in consumer products.|$|E

25|$|Several {{factors are}} said to limit the scope of proconsular {{authority}} in modern times.

40|$|Project (M. B. A., Business Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. The Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS) {{industry}} is a unique niche industry that facilitates telephone calls for primarily for deaf and hard of hearing individuals. Regulation {{plays a key role}} in this industry, and as such traditional market dynamics do not always apply. Governmental <b>rulemakings</b> have significant impacts on the way TRS companies create and execute strategy. This paper examines this unique industry, paying particular attention to the impacts of recent Federal Communications Commission (FCC) <b>rulemakings.</b> There are two specific questions addressed in this paper. First, how has the FCC???s 2006 ruling on the interoperability of TRS equipment impacted the industry? Second, what are the potential implications of the FCC???s 2008 TRS ten-digit numbering order? Overall this paper seeks to understand how these industry shocks impact consumers, regulators, and TRS providers. Data for this paper comes from publicly available materials, including FCC filings, consumer advisories, and fact sheets. Significant data was also obtained from the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA). In conclusion this paper finds the need for additional education of TRS consumers, and calls on consumer groups and FCC regulators to help ensure that TRS consumers understand their rights and responsibilities. Furthermore, this paper suggests strategies for TRS companies to peruse in response to the FCC???s recent TRS <b>rulemakings.</b> These strategies vary based on each company???s relative market share as well as the degree to which they specialize in providing TRS. Additional implications for regulators are also discussed. Business Administratio...|$|R

25|$|A {{decade after}} {{adoption}} of the 1996 management plan, and with several user standards flirting with repeated violation, FWP undertook a new <b>rulemaking</b> process in June 2007 {{with the intent of}} issuing a new management plan. Instead of relying on the Ad Hoc Committee and the Smith River Coordinated Resources Management Council, FWP established a new, eight-person Citizen Advisory Committee to identify issues and recommend actions. The CAC held 12 meetings over the next year while FWP staff conducted research, studied recreation and outfitter surveys and floater logs, and interviewed experts. Importantly, FWP also conducted an Environmental Assessment as outlined by federal law (NEPA) and rules. The draft plan and <b>rulemaking</b> were put online and public comments solicited for 45 days, during which FWP held five public meetings. The final rule and plan were issued on July 20, 2009.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{a notice}} of {{proposed}} <b>rulemaking</b> published on December 20, 1994, in the Federal Register {{and after a}} review of relevant data, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) proposed to place 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA into Schedule I, making 2C-B illegal in the United States.

40|$|Since {{the early}} Reagan years, critics {{have argued that}} benefit-cost {{analysis}} {{is used by the}} U. S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as a one-sided tool of deregulation to advance the interests of business. This article discloses a little-known fact: OMB also plays a powerful pro-regulation role when agency proposals address market failures and are supported by benefit-cost analysis. Drawing on four case studies from the George W. Bush Administration, the author examines how and why OMB encouraged regulatory initiatives while protecting some <b>rulemakings</b> from opposition by forces inside and outside of the executive branch. The case studies address the labeling of foods for trans fat content, control of diesel engine exhaust, improvement of light-truck fuel economy, and control of air pollution from coal-fired power plants. OMB's role in the 2001 - 2006 period was unusual by historic standards because, rather than await agency drafts, OMB played a pro-active role in both the initiation of <b>rulemakings</b> and the creation of regulatory alternatives for consideration. The benefit-cost framework could be much more powerful if greater investments were made in applied research to expand knowledge on key regulatory issues. ...|$|R
