40|$|The {{main purpose}} with this {{investigation}} was to clarify when or if specific grades will soften or harden during the straightening process in a seven roll cross <b>roll</b> <b>straightening</b> machine. The aim was solely made to include tubes which had been cold worked to achieve high yield strength levels. The straightening process will induce lengthwise tensile and compressive stress and strain. According to theory straightening could therefore also induce considerable Bauschinger effect.   Physical tests, with material from pilgered tubes, in a laboratory environment were performed to give a well-defined set up of the strain levels and sign of the same. Real in process trials were also performed. Parallel to the physical laboratory tests and the real process tests a FEM-simulation and a FEM-model to calculate strain levels was developed.   Two material types were investigated, but the results are only unambiguous for material A. Further investigations {{need to be done}} on material B to give a clear picture...|$|E
40|$|A {{process chain}} for {{manufacturing}} of machine parts in general consists of several process steps, e. g. continuous casting, hot rolling, annealing, pre straightening, cold drawing, straightening and polishing, machining, induction hardening, and grinding. Distortion is frequently observed {{after the final}} heat treatment process. However not only the hardening process, but also {{the history of the}} manufacturing chain is responsible. In the present work several essential manufacturing steps of a process chain were investigated experimentally and the distribution of the residual stresses as an important carrier of distortion potential was analyzed by means of non destructive neutron diffraction over the whole cross section of the shafts. The results showed nonsymmetrical residual stress distribution along the cross section after the pre straightening of the uncoiled wire. The cold drawing created high tensile residual stresses at the surface in radial and tangential directions, while much higher compressive stresses were found, particularly in axial direction, in the core. The residual stresses of the drawn shaft were reduced largely by a following cross <b>roll</b> <b>straightening.</b> The final induction hardening changed the residual stress state again largely in dependence on the process parameters. The influences of the investigated manufacturing steps on the residual stress states are finally discussed in connection with the resulting distortion...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{microstructure}} and mechanical properties of copper, CuZn 36 brass and CuSn 6 bronze strips annealed and after repetitive corrugation and straightening (RCS) process. The influence of process parameters on the functional properties of strips was investigated. In the study increase in the yield strength and tensile strength of the material after RCS process was observed. Crystallite size measurement confirmed presence of nano-scale structures in the studied materials after deformation by RCS process. The applied method of plastic deformation is promising in development of materials with improved functional properties. The paper presents also results of numerical simulations of Cu strip after corrugation on groove and tooth <b>rolls</b> and <b>straightening.</b> <b>Rolling</b> process simulations were conducted using Forge 2011 ® based on the finite element method...|$|R
40|$|This study {{involved}} fabrication of simulated plate fuel elements. Uranium silicide of actual fuel elements {{was replaced with}} yttria. The fabrication stages were otherwise identical. The final cold <b>rolled</b> and/or <b>straightened</b> plates, without stress relief, showed an inverse relationship between bond strength and out of plane residual shear stress (tau(13)). Stress relief of tau(13) was conducted over a range of temperatures/times (200 - 500 degrees C and 15 - 240 min) and led to corresponding improvements in bond strength. Fastest tau(13) relief was obtained through 300 degrees C annealing. Elimination of microscopic shear bands, through recovery and partial recrystallization, was clearly the most effective mechanism of relieving tau(13). (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

There may be a hot rolling stand after withdrawal {{to take advantage of}} the metal's hot condition to pre-shape the final strand. Finally, the strand is cut into predetermined lengths by mechanical shears or by travelling oxyacetylene torches, is marked for identification, and is taken either to a stockpile or to the next forming process.|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 1 - 8 Rotor bow during {{hot restart}} {{is a common}} cause of high {{vibrations}} in turbomachinery. It may occur after the shutdown of a machine operating under load, if the rotor is left cooling in standstill condition (no turning gear) with a subsequent restart of the machine performed {{before the end of}} the thermal transient. A complete model of the phenomenon was developed, in order to predict the amplitude of rotor vibrations during hot restart. The thermal distribution across the rotor is calculated basing on fluid-dynamic theory, and is used as boundary condition for a finite element analysis (FEA) that returns the deformed shape of the rotor. Vibration amplitude during compressor restart is then calculated with the traditional tools used for rotordynamic analysis, by unbalancing the rotor according to FEA results. The developed model has been used to simulate a real case for which experimental data were available. Calculation results showed very good agreement with experimental measures, confirming the expected features of the phenomenon, its trend with time and the effectiveness of slow <b>roll</b> in <b>straightening</b> the rotor and reducing vibration amplitude...|$|R
40|$|Today is on {{products}} {{from the perspective of}} quality placed an increasing emphasis. This work is focused to the analyze of cross roll straghtening of long semifinished products with a circular cross-section. This process increased quality of semifinished {{products from the}} perspective of their curvature, because they do not reach the required limit values. Curvature of the semifinished product is due to residual stress, which is during straghtening using plastic deformation of the material redistributed and the semifinished product is leveled. This work analyzes the effect of rotation of <b>straightening</b> <b>rolls</b> on the distributiom of contact pressure between the straightening semifinished product and the roll of straightener. Author then analyzes effect of input parameters of program to straightening at the final curvature of the semifinished product.

40|$|The paper {{treats the}} {{application}} of a system of producing replica to non-destructive metallography and non-destructive analysis of surface topography. The replicas were produced by the Struers company and are known under trade name of RepliSet-F 5. They are made of fastcuring two-part silicon rubber capable of flexible, high-resolution capturing of a surface image. A new type of replicas was applied to the surface analysis. This type is designed for general purposes, particularly for flat surfaces, at normal and elevated temperatures. Some older replicas of the same firm named TRANSKOPY were also applied. These ones are reflective metallographic replicas for convex and concave part surfaces applied to non-destructive testing. Both systems of the replicas were applied to a microstructure analysis, crack analysis of axles and <b>straightening</b> <b>rolls.</b> The results obtained in the analyses of the microstructure, surfaces, damages, and cracks show that the replica technique can be exceptionally efficient particularly in those cases where on-site facilities and usually also large and expensive facilities in operation, for which periodic examinations are specified, are analysed...|$|R
5000|$|The cap of {{the fruit}} body is 3 to 12 cm in diameter, and {{depending}} on its age, is either conic to convex, to somewhat flattened at maturity. The cap margin is initially <b>rolled</b> downward before <b>straightening</b> out, often with hanging remnants of partial veil (...) [...] The cap surface is covered with densely matted filaments that are rough and scale-like. The scales are pink to brownish red, fading to a pale brown-gray or dull yellow in maturity. Under the scales, the cap surface is yellow to pale yellow-orange. While many other Suillus species have a sticky or slimy cap, S. spraguei is dry. The flesh is yellow.The pores {{on the underside of}} the cap are yellowish and angular, measuring 0.5 to 5 mm wide, and formed by tubes that extend 4 to 8 mm deep. These pores have a slightly decurrent attachment to the stem (extending down its length). Young specimens have a whitish fibrous partial veil that protects the developing pores; as the cap expands it rips the veil, which remains as a grayish ring on the stem. The stem is 4 to 12 cm long, and 1 to 2.5 cm thick, roughly cylindrical in shape, or sometimes with a bulbous bottom so as to be somewhat club-shaped. The stem surface is tomentose, with scales at the top, and a ring on the upper half of the stem. Below the ring the stem is fibrillose, covered with a mat of soft hairs. Its color at the top is yellow, but with wine-red to reddish-brown scales below, underlaid with a pale yellow to grayish color. The stem is usually solid, rarely hollow. The tissue of all parts {{of the fruit}} body—cap, pores, and stem—will turn brownish shortly after being bruised or injured.|$|R
5000|$|A {{major problem}} {{that may occur}} in {{continuous}} casting is breakout of the liquid metal: for whatever reason, the solid shell of the strand breaks and allows the still-molten metal contained within to spill out and foul the machine. In most industrial environments this event is very costly as it leads to a shutdown of the strand and typically requires an extended turnaround involving removal of the spilled material from within the strand equipment and/or replacement of damaged machinery. A breakout is usually due to the shell wall being too thin to support the liquid column above it, a condition which has several root causes often related to heat management. Improper cooling water flow to the mould or the strand cooling sprays may lead to inadequate heat removal from the solidifying metal, causing the solid shell to thicken too slowly. If the metal withdrawal rate is too fast, the shell may {{not have time to}} solidify to the required thickness even with enhanced cooling sprays. Similarly, the incoming liquid metal may be too hot and the final solidification may occur further down the strand at a later point than expected; if this point is below the <b>straightening</b> <b>rolls,</b> the shell may break from stresses applied during straightening. A breakout can also occur as a result of physical irregularities or damage to the shell occurring within the mould during the initial seconds of solidification. Excessive turbulence within the mold may cause an irregular shell pattern that grows abnormally or it may entrap slag droplets within the shell which reduces the wall strength. [...] A common occurrence is for the shell to stick to the mould's surface and tear; modern instrumented molds and computer control systems typically detect this and slow the caster down temporarily to let the wall refreeze and heal while it is still supported in the mould. [...] Should the tear occur near the exit of the mould or be of unexpected severity, the shell may still fail in a breakout once it emerges from the mould wall. If the incoming metal is severely overheated, it may be preferable to stop the caster than to risk a breakout. Additionally, lead contamination of the metal (caused by counterweights or lead-acid batteries in the initial steel charge) can form a thin film between the mould wall and the steel, inhibiting heat removal and shell growth and increasing the risk of breakouts.|$|R
