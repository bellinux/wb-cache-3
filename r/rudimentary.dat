5|$|The {{subject of}} the series, whose name was never released, was an {{intersex}} person with a male build and stature, but who may have self-identified as female and/or been assigned female at birth. The subject had a small, probably hypospadic, penis, <b>rudimentary</b> scrotum, and male pubic hair pattern. The subject also had a retracted or <b>rudimentary</b> clitoral hood and vaginal opening. In most photographs the subject's face and chest are covered.|$|E
5|$|At home, {{away from}} the work of the farm, his {{education}} was not neglected. Although restricted to <b>rudimentary</b> home schooling, his mother's own notable education placed him and his siblings at an advantage compared with other children in similar circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the branchiostegal lung, the coconut crab has an additional <b>rudimentary</b> set of gills. Although these gills are comparable in number to aquatic species from the families Paguridae and the Diogenidae, they are reduced in size and have comparatively less surface area.|$|E
5|$|Other sources {{assert that}} General Whiteside {{originally}} buried {{the dead in}} a common grave on a ridge south of the battlefield, marked with a <b>rudimentary</b> wooden memorial. These sources make no mention of Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Some men use the baths as {{a cheaper}} {{alternative}} to hotels, despite {{the limitations of}} being potentially crowded public venues with only <b>rudimentary</b> rooms and limited or non-existent pass out privileges.|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{computer}} forensics is {{to explain the}} current state of a digital artifact; such as a computer system, storage medium or electronic document. The discipline usually covers computers, embedded systems (digital devices with <b>rudimentary</b> computing power and onboard memory) and static memory (such as USB pen drives).|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} ten, Pei {{moved with}} his family to Shanghai after his father was promoted. Pei {{attended}} Saint Johns Middle School, run by Protestant missionaries. Academic discipline was rigorous; students were allowed only one half-day each month for leisure. Pei enjoyed playing billiards and watching Hollywood movies, especially those of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. He also learned <b>rudimentary</b> English skills by reading the Bible and novels by Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|Compressor diving is a <b>rudimentary</b> {{method of}} surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} {{tropical}} regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E
5|$|During evolution, darts {{appear to}} have been lost secondarily, i.e., after they had evolved and been functional. Vestigial darts (ones that exist only in a <b>rudimentary</b> condition) occur in the family Sagdidae, and in many Helicoidea, the {{surrounding}} organs have also degenerated (become non-functional). The sarcobelum is a fleshy or cuticle-coated papilla which {{is considered to be a}} degenerated, previously dart-bearing, organ.|$|E
5|$|In July, the Federal Bureau of Prisons {{rejected}} {{a request by}} the Army to transfer Manning from the USDB to a civilian facility for treatment of her gender dysphoria. Instead, the Army kept Manning in military custody {{and said it would}} begin <b>rudimentary</b> gender treatment, which could include allowing her to wear female undergarments and possibly receive hormone treatments.|$|E
5|$|Islamic {{methods of}} mathematics, astronomy, and science {{made their way}} to Africa, East Asia and Europe during the Pax Mongolica. Methods of paper-making and {{printing}} made their way from China to Europe. During the Pax Mongolica <b>rudimentary</b> banking systems were established, and money changing and credit extension were common, resulting in large amount of merchant wealth.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{population}} live in poverty, occupied in farming or raising livestock. Some have moved to the cities to seek {{a higher standard of}} living, returning to help during the peak periods of agricultural activity. Infrastructure is underdeveloped; there is no electricity supply, most water comes from traditional wells, and the <b>rudimentary</b> school system provides only elementary education in poorly equipped establishments.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rudimentary</b> organs such as {{the human}} tailbone, now much reduced from their {{functional}} state, are readily understood as signs of evolution, the explanation being that they were cut down by natural selection from functioning organs when their functions were no longer needed, but make {{no sense at all}} if species are considered to be fixed. The tailbone is homologous to the tails of other primates.|$|E
5|$|Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class is {{designed}} to teach the boy Scoutcraft skills, teamwork, and self-reliance. Scout is the first rank, awarded when a boy first joins the Scouts, and requires just a <b>rudimentary</b> knowledge of Scouting's ideals. Further ranks have progressive requirements {{in the areas of}} Scoutcraft, physical fitness, citizenship, personal growth, and Scout Spirit. Scouts with a permanent mental or physical disability may use alternate requirements, based on their abilities and approved by the council.|$|E
5|$|Social {{amenities}} were <b>rudimentary</b> {{even before}} {{the formation of the}} Rhondda Urban District Council in 1897. Due to the geographic layout of the valleys, land was a scarce resource, and therefore leisure activities that took up little space, time and money were sought. This saw the popularity of activities such as greyhound races, cockfighting, open air handball courts (often attached to a public house), boxing booths, foot racing and rugby union.|$|E
5|$|The {{coconut crab}} is {{terrestrial}} and uses structures called branchiostegal lungs to breathe air. They cannot swim and would drown in water, yet they possess a <b>rudimentary</b> set of gills. They can breathe {{on land and}} hold their breath underwater. The branchiostegal lungs {{are seen as a}} developmental adaptive stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.|$|E
5|$|The ferry {{currently}} operates {{between a}} floating boathouse {{on the north}} bank of the Thames and a <b>rudimentary</b> jetty on the south bank. The boathouse is also in use as a private mooring for leisure craft. The ferry operates on all weekends, and weekdays between February and October. As well as the ferry service, rowboats, canoes and motorboats can also be hired from the boathouse.|$|E
5|$|The floral tube {{is formed}} by fusion of the basal {{segments}} of the tepals (proximally connate). Its shape is from an inverted cone (obconic) to funnel-shaped (funneliform) or cylindrical, and is surmounted by the more distal corona. Floral tubes can range from long and narrow in sections Apodanthi and Jonquilla to <b>rudimentary</b> (N. cavanillesii).|$|E
5|$|The modern Maryland Terrapins {{football}} program representing the University of Maryland traces its lineage {{to the team}} first formed at {{what was then the}} Maryland Agricultural College (MAC) in 1892. In the initial years, due to the <b>rudimentary</b> state of intercollegiate athletics and interstate travel, all games were played against local colleges, high schools, and athletic clubs.|$|E
5|$|Verb {{morphology}} in Wagiman {{is highly}} irregular. Of the small inventory of inflecting verbs, many {{have their own}} unique tense suffixes, while other tense suffixes are common to several verbs, and while some <b>rudimentary</b> verb classes can be identified - stance verbs always take the past tense suffix -nginy , for instance - the tense suffixes must be learned for each individual verb.|$|E
5|$|A Paleolithic culture around 30,000BC {{constitutes}} {{the first known}} habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and <b>rudimentary</b> agriculture, including by ancestors of contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people. Decorated clay vessels from this period {{are some of the}} oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world. Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the Jōmon. The Yayoi period, starting around 500BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery and metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.|$|E
5|$|A {{period of}} <b>rudimentary</b> {{training}} followed, firstly at Hopuhopu Military Camp {{and then at}} Papakura, before {{it was confirmed that}} the battalion was on active service. It departed New Zealand on the Orient liner RMS Orion for the Middle East on 5 January 1940 as part of the 4th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Division New Zealand Division. Before it left, it paraded before the public at the Auckland Domain and was addressed by the commander of the Northern Military District, Lieutenant Colonel Norman Weir.|$|E
5|$|A riot {{occurred}} on 4 June 1968, precipitated by the serving of allegedly contaminated food to prisoners the previous evening. Other factors that contributed were the <b>rudimentary</b> and deplorable state of sanitation and personal cleanliness facilities, tougher sentencing introduced with the Parole Act of 1964, and the overcrowding. When the work bell was rung at 1 pm, prisoners rebelled; refusing {{to go back}} to work, they assembled themselves in the exercise yards. The prison superintendent Mr Thorpe negotiated with two deputations of prisoners. As well as better food, they demanded single cells and the dismissal of specific wardens.|$|E
5|$|A {{short period}} of <b>rudimentary</b> {{training}} followed {{under the tutelage of}} members of the Australian Instructional Corps. This was completed by April 1940, and that month the battalion– under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Godfrey, a First World War veteran who had previously commanded the 23rd/21st Battalion– embarked for the Middle East on the transport ship Neuralia, departing from Port Melbourne and sailing via Fremantle, Colombo, Aden and the Suez Canal. At this time it was attached to the 17th Brigade, which was assigned to the 6th Division. Recruited from Victoria– although at various times the battalion's composition was boosted by recruits from other states– the 17th also consisted of the 2/5th, 2/7th and 2/8th Battalions.|$|E
5|$|Around the 33rd day of development, the vesicles {{begin to}} {{differentiate}}. Closer {{to the back}} of the embryo, they form what will become the utricle and semicircular canals. Closer to the front of the embryo, the vesicles differentiate into a <b>rudimentary</b> saccule, which will eventually become the saccule and cochlea. Part of the saccule will eventually give rise and connect to the cochlear duct. This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the ductus reuniens.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus {{is the source}} of much {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had <b>rudimentary</b> auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. Some argue that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E
5|$|At Hitler's behest, the Volkssturm (People's Storm) – a {{nationwide}} militia of men previously considered unsuitable {{for military service}} – was formed on 18 October 1944. Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his Gau alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only <b>rudimentary</b> training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve {{on the front lines}} against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{external}} appearance, Plectania nannfeldtii {{is similar to}} Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although this latter species {{may be difficult to}} distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters identify it more definitively: P.vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14µm. Helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, whitish margins on the cup edges, and shorter stems than P.nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier outer surface, a darker inner cup surface, and a <b>rudimentary</b> stem.|$|E
5|$|Bulky and soft-bodied, {{the false}} {{catshark}} has a broad {{head with a}} short, rounded snout. The nostrils have large flaps of skin on their anterior rims. The narrow eyes are over {{twice as long as}} high, and are equipped with <b>rudimentary</b> nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are large spiracles. The huge mouth is arched and bears short furrows at the corners. There are over two hundred rows of tiny teeth in each jaw, arranged in straight lines in the upper jaw and diagonal lines in the lower jaw; each tooth has a pointed central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly small.|$|E
5|$|Day {{focussed}} on the girls' education, in {{the style}} of Emile. He expanded on the teaching they had received from the Foundling Hospital in reading and basic arithmetic, and also taught them how to write. He believed that the girls should be able to manage the house, so they were charged with cooking and cleaning as well as other housework. Finally, he {{wanted to be able to}} debate complex concepts with them, so he taught them <b>rudimentary</b> theories in physics and geography, tasking them with observing the changing of the seasons, and recording details of sunrises and sunsets. He also imparted to them Rousseau's philosophical contempt for luxury.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the species, {{there are}} two to fifteen large showy flowers, which {{are more or less}} zygomophic and hermaphrodite. Each flower is 1320cm (5"8") across, and the native species are usually purple or red. They are funnelform (funnel shaped) and declinate (curving {{downwards}} and then upwards at the tip) in shape. The perianth has six brightly colored tepals (three outer sepals and three inner petals) that may be similar in appearance or very different. The perianth segments are subequal or unequal. The tepals are united at the base to form a short tube, usually with a <b>rudimentary</b> scaly paraperigonium with fimbriae or a callose ridge present at the throat.|$|E
5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a <b>rudimentary</b> form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing {{at the opposite end of}} the track waving towels.|$|E
5|$|Duncan initiates {{the player}} into the Grey Wardens through a {{dangerous}} ritual called the Joining, which involves imbibing Darkspawn blood. The recipient is either killed or imbued with the powerful darkspawn essence, the Taint, granting them {{the ability to}} sense Darkspawn and a <b>rudimentary</b> connection into their hive mind. Afterwards, the player and fellow Grey Warden, Alistair, are tasked with lighting a beacon {{at the top of}} the fortress to signal Loghain's men into charging the horde's flank. However, upon arriving, Loghain abandons the battlefield with his army, leaving Cailan, Duncan, and their army to be overwhelmed and slain by the Darkspawn, who seize control of Ostagar and begin advancing into southern Ferelden.|$|E
5|$|Etty put a {{great deal}} of effort into the painting, {{including}} visiting a mortuary to sketch the dead and decaying bodies on the Sirens' island. His use of real corpses became publicly known, causing complaints from some critics. Although he visited Brighton in 1836 to make studies of the sea in connection with the painting, Etty had little experience of landscape and seascape painting, and the painting of the sea and clouds is <b>rudimentary</b> in comparison {{with the rest of the}} work.|$|E
5|$|Fisher and his brother, Henry, won {{scholarships}} to Whitley Bay High School and Monkseaton High School. Though Fisher {{was not as}} hard working as Henry, he showed aptitude for science, mathematics, languages, art and music, inherited in part from his father's abilities. Encouraging their son's love of music, Fisher's parents gave him piano lessons; he also learned to play the guitar. It was during this period that Fisher developed an interest in amateur radio, constructing <b>rudimentary</b> spark transmitters and receivers.|$|E
5|$|In God Speaks, Meher Baba {{describes}} {{the journey of}} the soul from its original state of unconscious divinity to the ultimate attainment of conscious divinity. The whole journey is a journey of imagination, where the original indivisible state of God imagines becoming countless individualized souls which he likens to bubbles within an infinite ocean. Each soul, powered {{by the desire to}} become conscious, starts its journey in the most <b>rudimentary</b> form of consciousness. This limitation brings the need of a more developed form to advance it towards an increasingly conscious state. Consciousness grows in relation to the impressions each form is capable of gathering.|$|E
