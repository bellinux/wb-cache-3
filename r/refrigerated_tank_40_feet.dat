40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) is {{currently}} processing Sludge Batch 5 (SB 5) from <b>Tank</b> <b>40.</b> SB 5 contains {{the contents of}} Tank 51 from November 2008, qualified by the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and the heel in <b>Tank</b> <b>40</b> remaining from Sludge Batch 4. Current Liquid Waste Operations (LWO) plans are to (1) decant supernatant from <b>Tank</b> <b>40</b> to remove excess liquid caused by a leaking slurry pump and (2) receive a Np stream from H Canyon It {{should be noted that}} the Np stream contains significant nitrate requiring addition of nitrite to <b>Tank</b> <b>40</b> to maintain a high nitrite to nitrate ratio for corrosion control.

40|$|The Small Column Ion Exchange (SCIX) {{process is}} being {{developed}} to remove cesium, strontium, and actinides from Savannah River Site (SRS) Liquid Waste using an existing waste tank (i. e., Tank 41 H) to house the process.

Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) is conducting pilot-scale mixing tests to determine the pump requirements for mixing MST, CST, and simulated sludge.

40|$|Waste Solidification Engineering (WSE) has {{requested}} that characterization and a radioactive {{demonstration of the}} next batch of sludge slurry - Sludge Batch 7 b (SB 7 b) - be completed in the Shielded Cells Facility of the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) via a Technical Task Request (TTR). This characterization and demonstration, or sludge batch qualification process, is required prior to transfer of the sludge from Tank 51 to the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) feed <b>tank</b> (<b>Tank</b> <b>40).</b> The current WSE practice is to prepare sludge batches in Tank 51 by transferring sludge from other tanks. Discharges of nuclear materials from H Canyon are often added to Tank 51 during sludge batch preparation. The sludge is washed and transferred to <b>Tank</b> <b>40,</b> the current DWPF feed tank. Prior to transfer of Tank 51 to <b>Tank</b> <b>40,</b> SRNL typically simulates the Tank Farm and DWPF processes with a Tank 51 sample (referred to as the qualification sample). With the tight schedule constraints for SB 7 b and the potential need for caustic addition to allow for an acceptable glass processing window, the qualification for SB 7 b was approached differently than past batches. For SB 7 b, SRNL prepared a Tank 51 and a <b>Tank</b> <b>40</b> sample for qualification. SRNL did not receive the qualification sample from Tank 51 nor did it simulate all of the Tank Farm washing and decanting operations. Instead, SRNL prepared a Tank 51 SB 7 b sample from samples of Tank 7 and Tank 51, along with a wash solution to adjust the supernatant composition to the final SB 7 b Tank 51 Tank Farm projections. SRNL then prepared a sample to represent SB 7 b in <b>Tank</b> <b>40</b> by combining portions of the SRNL-prepared Tank 51 SB 7 b sample and a <b>Tank</b> <b>40</b> Sludge Batch 7 a (SB 7 a) sample. The blended sample was 71 % <b>Tank</b> <b>40</b> (SB 7 a) and 29 % Tank 7 /Tank 51 on an insoluble solids basis. This sample {{is referred to as}} the SB 7 b Qualification Sample. The blend represented the highest projected <b>Tank</b> <b>40</b> heel (as of May 25, 2011), and thus, the highest projected noble metals content for SB 7 b. Characterization was performed on the Tank 51 SB 7 b samples and SRNL performed DWPF simulations using the <b>Tank</b> <b>40</b> SB 7 b material. This report documents: (1) The preparation and characterization of the Tank 51 SB 7 b and <b>Tank</b> <b>40</b> SB 7 b samples. (2) The performance of a DWPF Chemical Process Cell (CPC) simulation using the SB 7 b <b>Tank</b> <b>40</b> sample. The simulation included a Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) cycle, where acid was added to the sludge to destroy nitrite and reduce mercury, and a Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) cycle, where glass frit was added to the sludge in preparation for vitrification. The SME cycle also included replication of five canister decontamination additions and concentrations. Processing parameters were based on work with a nonradioactive simulant. (3) Vitrification of a portion of the SME product and characterization and durability testing (as measured by the Product Consistency Test (PCT)) of the resulting glass. (4) Rheology measurements of the SRAT receipt, SRAT product, and SME product. This program was controlled by a Task Technical and Quality Assurance Plan (TTQAP), and analyses were guided by an Analytical Study Plan. This work is Technical Baseline Research and Development (R&D) for the DWPF. It should be noted that much of the data in this document has been published in interoffice memoranda.
