Alternatively, there is a secret idol in Wave 8 that will reveal the hidden exit. To pass <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> use of both TNT and the Sankara Stones. Wave 11 leads to the exit and Wave 12 recreates the scene with the rope bridge and the final battle with Mola Ram.|$|E
5|$|A few {{animal species}} {{are the result}} of hybridization. The Lonicera fly is a natural hybrid. The American red wolf appears to be a hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote, {{although}} its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy. The European edible frog is a semi-permanent hybrid between pool frogs and marsh frogs; its population <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> continued presence of {{at least one of the}} parent species. Cave paintings indicate that the European bison is a natural hybrid of the aurochs and the steppe bison.|$|E

5000|$|The {{smoothness}} {{requirements on}} the transition functions can be weakened, {{so that we}} only <b>require</b> <b>the</b> transition maps to be k-times continuously differentiable; or strengthened, so that we <b>require</b> <b>the</b> transition maps to be real-analytic. Accordingly, this gives a [...] or (real-)analytic structure on the manifold rather than a smooth one. Similarly, we can define a complex structure by <b>requiring</b> <b>the</b> transition maps to be holomorphic.|$|R
25|$|Gather quests, {{also known}} as {{collection}} quests, require a character to collect a number of items. These can either be gathered from a location or environment, or <b>require</b> <b>the</b> character to kill creatures in order to collect <b>the</b> <b>required</b> items. <b>The</b> quest may also <b>require</b> <b>the</b> character to collect {{a number of different}} items, for example to assemble a device.|$|R
5|$|A {{key element}} of quantum {{mechanics}} is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which forbids the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of a particle along the same direction.

5|$|A {{maximum of}} 15 Desk Accessories may be {{installed}} at one time, including the Chooser, Scrapbook, and Control Panel. System 6 uses the Control Panel desk accessory to access all the installed control panels, which imposes severe user interface limitations. Desk Accessories cannot be installed or removed within the Finder; this <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> Font/DA Mover utility. System 7 also fixed this. Control panels, however, {{are contained in}} separate files.|$|E
5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E

5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials. Thus, the courts should avoid reviewing the merits of such executive decisions. This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held {{that the type of}} evidence admissible in the judicial process {{and the way in which}} it is adduced tends to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy considerations which need to be weighed against one another.|$|E
5|$|After {{determining}} which eligibility requirements {{participation in a}} program <b>requires,</b> <b>the</b> recipient must also assure that individual program participant or group eligibility was correctly determined by keeping evidence of such compliance, such as maintaining documentation in participant files (e.g., copies of HIV/Aids diagnosis, copies of federal income tax returns, etc.). Furthermore, the recipient must assure that only eligible individuals or groups participated in the program by establishing strict controls of program funds to avoid non-eligible persons from receiving the specific assistance.|$|E
5|$|Age of Empires <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> {{player to}} develop a civilization {{from a handful of}} hunter-gatherers to an {{expansive}} Iron Age Empire. To assure victory, the player must gather resources in order to pay for new units, buildings and more advanced technology. Resources must also be preserved, as no new resources become available as the game progresses, for example, trees that are cut down will not grow back.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} many diverse pathogens, {{many of which are}} {{constantly}} mutating, it is a surprise that a majority of individuals remain free of infections. Thus, maintenance of health <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> body to recognize all pathogens (antigens they present or produce) likely to exist. This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large (about 109) clones of B cells, each of which reacts against a specific epitope by recognizing and producing antibodies against it. However, at any given time very few clones actually remain receptive to their specific epitope. Thus, approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined. Moreover, in a lifetime, an individual usually <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> generation of antibodies against very few antigens in comparison with the number that the body can recognize and respond against.|$|E
5|$|Another {{part of the}} machine's {{exhibition}} was {{the completion of the}} knight's tour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the director with a mapping of the puzzle laid out.|$|E
