40|$|Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) {{pollution}} has {{negative impacts}} {{on human health}} and well-being. While efforts {{have been made to}} characterize the chemical reactions leading to SOA formation, reduced nitrogen compounds remain a poorly studied class of chemicals contributing to air pollution. Sources of reduced nitrogen compounds include agricultural emissions, biomass burning, carbon capture sequestration and selective catalytic reduction control devices, low vapor pressure volatile organic compounds (LVP-VOC) found in many consumer products, and charbroiled meats. Understanding the atmospheric chemical mechanisms of reduced nitrogen compounds is important for comprehensive design of effective air pollution strategies. Therefore, this study seeks to determine the impact of <b>reduced</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> chemistry on SOA formation. Experiments were conducted at the UCR College of Engineering â€“ Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT) Atmospheric Processes Laboratory. This facility houses several well characterized indoor environmental chambers, which allow for the study of atmospheric processes under controlled conditions. Chamber experiments consisted of a <b>reduced</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> being reacted with atmospheric oxidants including hydroxyl radical (OH) and nitrate radical (NO 3). The chemical composition of the gas and aerosol species were determined through mass spectrometry techniques. The physical properties of the aerosol, including density, volatility, and hygroscopicity, as well as particle concentration and size distribution were measured with a variety of house built particle mobility analyzers. A suite of gas analyzers were used to measure Ozone, NOx, and CO concentrations. Experiments with primary, secondary, and tertiary aliphatic amines have provided insights into previously undiscovered reaction mechanisms. Aqueous phase acid catalyzed aldol addition/condensation reactions were observed in secondary amine experiments under humid conditions. Carcinogenic nitramines were observed in secondary amine reactions with nitrate radical. Longer chain secondary amines formed less dense aerosol, suggesting the formation of fractal shaped particles. The discovery of oligomer formation in the reaction of amines with methyl functional groups (dimethylamine, trimethylamine, 2 -dimethylaminoethanol) with atmospheric radicals has important implications for SOA formation in areas with high concentrations of amine emissions. Meteorological factors including humidity and temperature {{played an important role in}} the reaction chemistry of reduced nitrogen compounds. Humidity provided additional, aqueous phase, reaction pathways. Temperature had an effect on gas to particle partitioning, particularly with the amine salts. The concentration of aerosol formed during radical oxidation of amino alcohols has implications on the use of these compounds in carbon capture sequestration control devices...|$|E
40|$|Increases and {{expansion}} of anthropogenic emissions of both oxidized nitrogen compounds, NO(x, a) nd a <b>reduced</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound,</b> NH 3, have driven an increase in nitrogen deposition. We estimate global NO x and NH 3 emissions and use {{a model of the}} global troposphere, MOGUNTIA, to examine the pre-industrial and contemporary quantities and spatial patterns of wet and dry NOy and NHx deposition. Pre-industrial wet plus dry NO x and NHx deposition was greatest for tropical ecosystems, related to soil emissions, biomass burning and lightning emissions. Contemporary NOy + NHx wet and dry deposition onto Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperate ecosystems averages more than four times that of pre-industrial N deposition and far exceeds contemporary tropical N deposition. All temperate and tropical biomes receive more N via deposition today than pre-industrially. Comparison of contemporary wet deposition model estimates to measurements of wet deposition reveal that modeled and measured wet deposition for both NO 3 - and NH 4 + were quite similar over the U. S. Over Western Europe, the model tended to underestimate wet deposition of NO 3 + and NH 4 + but bulk deposition measurements were comparable to modeled total deposition. For the U. S. and Western Europe, we also estimated N emission and deposition budgets. In the U. S., estimated emissions exceed interpolated total deposition by 3 - 6 Tg N, suggesting that substantial N is transported offshore and/or the remote and rural location of the sites may fail to capture the deposition of urban emissions. In Europe, by contrast, interpolated total N deposition balances estimated emissions within the uncertainty of each. [References: 94...|$|E

Changes in the concentrations of dissolved N sub(2) O paralleled those of NO super(-) d 3. However, few nitrifiers could be isolated. Although the decrease in NO super(-) d 3 at the lower depths has been attributed to denitrification, neither the measurements of N sub(2) O in acetylene-blocked samples, not the isolation of denitrifiers suggested high denitrification rates.

This conclusion was based on finding a proportionally increased incorporation of [15 N]ammonium into nitrate nitrogen with lipopolysaccharide treatment. Nitrate biosynthesis was also increased by intraperitoneal injection of carrageenan and subcutaneous injection of turpentine.

However, research in the 1980 s and 1990 s has established that nitrifiers and denitrifiers are not as metabolically fastidious as previously thought, and strict segregation is not necessary. Moreover, some bacteria are able to convert NH ~ and other <b>reduced</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> gas and the gaseous nitrogen oxides in combined nitrification/denitrification processes. Such organisms are of interest for wastewater treatment for two opposing reasons. Firstly, the idea of single-stage nitrogen removal has obvious attractions for system design.

This suggests that Cmm can survive in the soil {{as long as there is}} decaying host material present. It has also been determined that the genome of subsp. michiganensis does not have genes that encode for nitrate and nitrate reductases. This means that the bacteria depends on previously <b>reduced</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> or amino acids for its nitrogen source.

Similar treatment with glutamine plus nitrate resulted in little increase in nitrate reductase activity, in cultures grown previously with <b>reduced</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> and decreases in enzyme activity, in cultures adapted to nitrate. Labelling studies conducted in vivo revealed a rapid cessation of de novo nitrate reductase synthesis when glutamine was supplied to nitrate-adapted cultures {{in the presence of}} nitrate. Intracellular glutamine concentrations increased rapidly under these conditions and these cultures exhibited high glutamine: glutamate ratios. As nitrate was taken up in the presence of glutamine in these experiments, it is concluded that the glutamine-stimulated inhibition of nitrate reductase synthesis is a consequence of repression and rapid turnover of nitrate reductase mRNA and not inducer (nitrate) exclusion...|$|R

The results collected and presented in this chapter indicate that in the Archaean, the enzymatic part of this cycle was restricted to a partial segment of the modern energy conserving denitrification pathway and that abiotic redox conversions of nitrogen specific to the geoenvironment of the Archaean were the evolutionary precursors of many reactions now requiring enzyme catalysis.

There was no significant decline in total <b>reduced</b> <b>nitrogen</b> in the same organs over that period. Similar responses were evident in plants defoliated three times.

If other potential sources of nitrogen were used for the calculations, it was necessary to postulate that larger amounts of total nitrogen flowed through the crown and root to produce the measured dilution of 15 N compounds.

40|$|A {{decade ago}} {{observers}} {{began to take}} serious notice {{of the presence of}} crystalline silicate grains in the dust flowing away from some comets. While crystallinity had been seen in such objects previously, starting with the recognitions by Campins and Ryan (1990) that the 10 micron feature of Comet Halley resembled that of the mineral forsterite, most such observations were either ignored or dismissed as no path to explain such crystalline grains was available in the literature. When it was first suggested that an outward flow must be present to carry annealed silicate grains from the innermost regions of the Solar Nebula out to the regions where comets could form (Nuth, 1999; 2001) this suggestion was also dismissed because no such transport mechanism was known at the time. Since then not only have new models of nebular dynamics demonstrated the reality of long distance outward transport (Ciesla, 2007; 2008; 2009) but examination of older models (Boss, 2004) showed that such transport had been present but had gone unrecognized for many years. The most unassailable evidence for outward nebular transport came with the return of the Stardust samples from Comet Wild 2, a Kuiper-belt comet that contained micron-scale grains of high temperature minerals resembling the Calcium-Aluminum Inclusions found in primitive meteorites (Zolensky et aI., 2006) that formed at T > 1400 K. Now that outward transport in protostellar nebulae has been firmly established, a re-examination of its consequences for nebular gas is in order that takes into account both the factors that regulate both the outward flow as well as those that likely control the chemical composition of the gas. Laboratory studies of surface catalyzed reactions suggest that a trend toward more highly <b>reduced</b> carbon and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> in the gas phase should be correlated with a general increase in the crystallinity of the dust (Nuth et aI., 2000), but is such a trend actually observable?

The catalyst with higher stacking type active phase has weaker interaction with the support and can maintain high metal dispersion at higher metal loading. This catalyst is highly active especially for the hydrogenation pathway, which is dominant for the HDS of the most refractory sulfur compound (4, 6 -dimethyldibezothiophene).

This work presents molecular-level investigations of the reactive compound ketolimononaldehyde (KLA, C 9 H 14 O 3), a second-generation ozonolysis product of limonene (C 10 H 16), as a potent brown carbon precursor in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) through its reactions with <b>reduced</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> such as ammonium ion (NH 4 +), ammonia, and amino acids. The reactions of synthesized and purified KLA with NH 4 + and glycine resulted in the formation of chromophores nearly identical in spectral properties and formation rates to those found in similarly-aged limonene/O 3 SOA. Similar chemical reaction processes of limononaldehyde (LA, C 10 H 16 O 2) and pinonaldehyde (PA, C 10 H 16 O 2), the first-generation ozonolysis products of limonene and Î±-pinene, respectively, were also studied, but the resulting products did not exhibit the light absorption properties of brown carbon, suggesting that the unique molecular structure of KLA produces visible-light-absorbing compounds. The KLA/NH 4 + and KLA/GLY reactions produce water-soluble, hydrolysis-resilient chromophores with high mass absorption coefficients (MAC = 2000 - 4000 cm 2 g - 1) at Î» âˆ¼ 500 nm, precisely at the maximum of the solar emission spectrum. Liquid chromatography was used to isolate the light-absorbing fraction, and UV-Vis, FTIR, NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) techniques were used to investigate the structures {{and chemical}} properties of the light-absorbing compounds. The KLA browning reaction generates a diverse mixture of light-absorbing compounds, with the majority of the observable products containing 1 - 4 units of KLA and 0 - 2 nitrogen atoms. Based on the HR-MS product distribution, conjugated aldol condensates, secondary imines (Schiff bases), and N-heterocycles like pyrroles may contribute in varying degree to the light-absorbing properties of the KLA brown carbon. The results of this study demonstrate the high degree of selectivity of organic compound structures on the light-absorbing properties of SOA. Â© 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R
40|$|Limaological {{observations}} {{were made on}} a small pond in Oklahoma which receives runoff from a swine yard. Large populations of blue-green algae were dominant dwing the summer and Cblor~u., during the winter. Heavy runoff quickly decreased the concentration of ions on two occasions and abo altered the Iize and composition {{of the community of}} phytoplankton. The concenuation of major ions fluctuated markedly. Oxygen concenuations were often low and <b>reduced</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> predominated. The pond is similar to other biOo oxidation ponds in Oklahoma and probably would not be suitable for fish culture. The problem of contamination of water supplies by animal wastes is currently re-ceiving much attention. The most serious problems are oxygen depletion and eu-trophication in surface waters and nitrate accumulation in subsurface waters. Impounding runoff water from feedlots and heavily fertilized fields has been cited as a means {{to improve the quality of}} this water (1). In an effort to establish the occurrence of nitrogen fixation in im-pounded waters, the author conducted a study of a small pond receiving runoff from a swine yard during 1967 and 1968. Limnological {{observations were}} also made on phenomena which were thought to af-fect N 2 fixation. The purpose of this paper is to describe these observations, since these ponds receiving runoff from feedlots have not been studied extensively. The environment studied (hog pond) has a surface area of 0. 21 ha and a mean depth of about 50 em when the surface is at the level of the spillway. It is located in the SW 1, 4. NE 1, 4. Section 16, Township 19 North, Range 2 East, Payne County, Oklahoma. The pond receives runoff from a swine yard and the overflow from a small septic pit above. The flow from the pit is channeled into a small creek which flows irregularly into the pond. The bottOm of the pond is covered by a soft black ooze.

40|$|We {{report a}} study of changes in air quality due to {{emission}} reductions using the chemical transport model CAMx. The model domain includes all of Europe with a nested domain over Switzerland. The model simulations were performed with emissions for 1990 (the reference year for the Gothenburg Protocol), 2005 (the reference year for the revised Gothenburg Protocol), 2006 (for model validation) and 2020 (the target year for the revised Gothenburg Protocol) using three emission scenarios prepared by IIASA/GAINS. Changes in ozone, particulate matter and nitrogen deposition are the central theme of the study. The modelled relative changes in the annual average PM 2. 5 concentrations between 1990 and 2005 look reasonable based on various PM 10 and PM 2. 5 observations in the past. The results obtained in {{this study suggest that}} annual mean concentrations of PM 2. 5 decreased by about 20 â€“ 50 % in Europe. Simulations using the baseline scenario (BL 2020) suggest that PM 2. 5 concentrations in 2020 will be about 30 % lower than those in 2005. The largest predicted decrease in PM 2. 5, based on the MTFR (maximum technically feasible reduction) scenario, was about 60 % and was located mainly {{in the eastern part of}} Europe. In the case of ozone, both model results and measurements show an increase in the mean ozone mixing ratios between 1990 and 2005. The observations, however, suggest a larger increase, indicating the importance of background ozone levels. Although emission reductions caused a decrease in peak ozone values, average ozone levels in polluted regions increased due to reduced titration with nitric oxide (NO). This caused a change in the frequency distribution of ozone. Model simulations using emission scenarios for 2020 suggest that annual average ozone mixing ratios will continue to increase. Changes in the levels of the damage indicators AOT 40 for forests and SOMO 35 are reported as well. The model results suggest that nitrogen deposition has decreased by 10 â€“ 30 % in the eastern part of Europe since 1990, while it has increased by about 20 % in the Iberian Peninsula. The decrease is mainly due to the deposition of oxidized nitrogen species, whereas deposition of <b>reduced</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> increased. In Switzerland, nitrogen deposition is larger in the northern part of the Alps, where ammonia emissions are the highest. Applying the baseline scenario, we found that the deposition of oxidized <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> will have decreased by a further 40 % by 2020, whereas deposition of reduced species will continue to increase. This will lead to a 10 â€“ 20 % decrease in the total nitrogen deposition in most of the model domain, with a 10 % increase in the eastern part of Europe...|$|R
