40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the optimal {{operation}} and design of solar-thermal energy storage systems. First, optimization of time-variable operation to maximize revenue through selling and purchasing electricity to/from the grid is presented for a thermal energy storage system. Time-variable electricity prices and electricity buy-back from the grid to re-charge the energy storage is considered. The concentrated solar power on demand (CSPonD) concept, in which a salt pond receives solar energy, stores thermal energy, and delivers thermal energy to the power cycle is considered. Electric heaters {{are added to the}} CSPonD concept, allowing for periods of electricity buy-back from the grid to re-charge the energy storage. System-level models are developed and optimization of the design and operation is performed with local solvers. Three main case studies are considered: the first case study investigates the optimization of time-variable operation without electrical heating under time-invariant electricity price; the second case study optimizes the operation under time-variant electricity price without electric heaters; the third case study optimizes the operation under time-variant electricity price allowing charging of the pond using the grid electricity. The first case study reflects the time-invariant tariff model, whereas the second and third case studies consider a time-of-use feed-in-tariff. Two hourly price profiles are considered in order to assess the influence of it on the optimal design and operation of the thermal energy storage. The first electricity profile consists of a price profile that fluctuates moderately, and the second price profile fluctuates highly, including negative prices. The results show significant increase in the revenue when adding electric heaters. Under the moderately fluctuating electricity price, the use of heaters increases the revenue significantly, compared to the same case with no electric heaters considered. Under the highly fluctuating electricity price, the use of heaters more than doubles the revenue, compared to the same case with no electric heaters considered. Also, the performance analysis of a <b>regenerative</b> <b>thermal</b> energy storage system with enhancement heat transfer structures is presented. In a <b>regenerative</b> <b>thermal</b> storage system, thermal energy is transferred from a hot heat transfer fluid to the storage unit core elements during charge, and from the core elements to the cold heat transfer fluid during discharge. Herein, concrete as the solid storage material, nitrate solar salt as the heat transfer fluid, and aluminum plates as the heat transfer structures is considered. The discharge process from uniform initial temperature is studied with different configurations (pure concrete and concrete enhanced by transfer structures), operation strategies (laminar versus turbulent flow regimes), and dimensions. Results show a significant decrease in the cost of the thermal energy storage system when heat transfer structures are added, as well as a better performance in terms of discharge efficiency and discharge time period. The amount of solar salt needed for this configuration is approximately one fourth that required for a nitrate two-tank system operating with the same temperature difference. by Enrique Lizarraga-García.

40|$|The U. S. wood {{products}} {{industry is a}} leader in the production of innovative wood materials. New products are taking shape within a growth industry for fiberboard, plywood, particle board, and other natural material-based energy efficient building materials. However, at the same time, standards for clean air are becoming ever stricter. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) during production of {{wood products}} (including methanol, formaldehyde, acetylaldehyde, and mercaptans) must be tightly controlled. Conventional VOC and HAP emission control techniques such as <b>regenerative</b> <b>thermal</b> oxidation (RTO) and regenerative catalytic oxidation (RCO) require significant amounts of energy and generate secondary pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and spent carbon. Biological treatment of air emissions offers a cost-effective and sustainable control technology for industrial facilities facing increasingly stringent air emission standards. A novel biological treatment system that integrates two types of biofilter systems, promises significant energy and cost savings. This novel system uses microorganisms to degrade air toxins without the use of natural gas as fuel or the creation of secondary pollutants. The replacement of conventional thermal oxidizers with biofilters will yield natural gas savings alone in the range of $ 82, 500 to $ 231, 000 per year per unit. Widespread use of biofilters across the entire forest products industry could yield fuel savings up to 5. 6 trillion Btu (British thermal units) per year and electricity savings of 2. 1 trillion Btu per year. Biological treatment systems can also eliminate the production of NOx, SO 2, and CO, and greatly reduce CO 2 emissions, when compared to conventional thermal oxidizers. Use of biofilters for VOC and HAP emission control will provide not only the wood products industry but also the pulp and paper industry with a means to cost-effectively control air emissions. The goal of this project was to demonstrate a novel sequential treatment technology that integrates two types of biofilter systems – biotrickling filtration and biofiltration – for controlling forest product facility air emissions with a water-recycling feature for water conservation. This coupling design maximizes the conditions for microbial degradation of odor causing compounds at specific locations. Water entering the biotrickling filter is collected in a sump, treated, and recycled back to the biotrickling filter. The biofilter serves as a polishing step to remove more complex organic compounds (i. e., terpenes). The gaseous emissions from the hardboard mill presses at lumber plants such as that of the Stimson Lumber Company contain both volatile and condensable organic compounds (VOC and COC, respectively), as well as fine wood and other very small particulate material. In applying bio-oxidation technology to these emissions Texas A&M University-Kingsville (TAMUK) and Bio•Reaction (BRI) evaluated the potential of this equipment to resolve two (2) control issues which are critical to the industry: • First, the hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions (primarily methanol and formaldehyde) and • Second, the fine particulate and COC from the press exhaust which contribute to visual emissions (opacity) from the stack. In a field test in 2006, the biological treatment technology met the HAP and COC control project objectives and demonstrated significantly lower energy use (than <b>regenerative</b> <b>thermal</b> oxidizers (RTOs) or regenerative catalytic oxidizers (RCOs), lower water use (than conventional scrubbers) all the while being less costly than either for maintenance.

Government and some organizations have tried to make related industries install appropriate odor control systems by detailed instructions, occasionally by presenting handbooks and manuals. However, some of traditional methods may become economically unreasonable because some new methods are now gaining popularity. In future, Japanese manufacturers will have to supply some low-energy technologies to achieve more effective odor control and to have them accepted worldwide. In this report, the market of industrial odor control systems in Japan is introduced. A rough estimation suggested that the scale of this market is around 13 - 22 billion yen/year in the present, but it will increase up to 30 billion yen/year after five years. Then, outlook for several major odor control methods are explained. <b>Regenerative</b> <b>thermal</b> oxidizer (RTO) and plasma oxidizer are the typical examples of state-or-the-art odor control methods, but biofiltration will play an important role of the environmental-friendly method for odor and VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) control. 1) Background Japan has a strict policy on odor nuisance, and it is defined by The Offensive Odor Control Law (1972). This law regulates emission of odor against all industries located in designated area, and the measurement of odor is conducted by ether instrument or human nose. Especially, sensory odor measurement, which uses human nose and measures detection threshold, detects all kinds of odor compounds. Therefore it is necessary for industry to control all kinds of odorous compounds, if their area is regulated by a certain value of Odor Index which is calculated by the value of dilution-to-threshold.

40|$|Nowadays H 2 S and CO 2 are {{strongly}} undesired coal gasification by-products. Nonetheless, despite his bad reputation, H 2 S is quite an interesting chemical since {{it contains a}} highly noble species, the hydrogen. Basing on recent advances, {{it is possible to}} convert H 2 S and CO 2 into valuable products and specifically into syngas according to the oxi-reduction reaction: 2 H 2 S + CO 2  → H 2  + CO + S 2  + H 2 O, whenever it takes place into a <b>regenerative</b> <b>thermal</b> reactor and at specific operating conditions. Such a technology allows to enable some energy sources currently still unexploited due to their relevant content in sulfur, such as some crude oils, natural gases, and coal sources. For example, the Sulcis coal in Italy has the 5 to 9 %w/w, the Hungarian coal has the 3 to 5 %w/w, and the Inner Mongolia-Chinese coal has up to 18 % of sulfur content. In the coal gasification process, the sulfur is converted into H 2 S and COS according to the operating conditions. Looking forward to the use of these sulfur-rich sources of energy, it is of key importance to consider the possible formation of organosulfur compounds such as COS and CS 2 : H 2 S + CO 2  → COS + H 2 O, H 2 S + COS → CS 2  + H 2 O, as they could reduce the effectiveness of the technology and could cause environmental problems.

The target is to demonstrate that higher content in sulfur means lower emissions of CO 2 without any additional environmental impact due to organosulfur species.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} {{possibilities}} {{to comply with}} the standards given by the ordinance on biological waste treatment facilities (30. BImSchV). A main focus thereby was done on the environmental impact of the waste gas cleaning system called non catalytic (<b>regenerative)</b> <b>thermal</b> oxidation (RTO). As a result of the new environmental standards the conception of mechanical biological (pre-) treatment plants (MBT/P) had to change. In particular the low standards for organic carbons in the exhaust gas of MBT necessitate a thermal treatment of this gas at least for heavily loaded gas streams. As the knowledge about emissions of RTO plant used for the treatment of MBT exhaust gas was very limited, extensive measurements were made within this research work. Beside the emission standards for several pollutants the ordinance on biological waste treatment facilities gives weight specific standards (loads) for organic carbons and nitrous oxide. These loads involve the waste input quantities and the exhaust air volumes of MBT plants into the emission calculation. An emission source analysis with a special focus on the organic carbon emissions from plant components of a modern MBT plants was made at the MBT in Borken (North Rhine-Westphalia). The found emission progression in both the discharge area and the area of mechanical waste treatment gave reason to the conclusion that a cleaning of gas from these areas via biofilters as publicised by several companies will not work properly. So these gas amounts have to be used in subsequent areas of MBT such as the biological waste treatment. In the area of biological waste treatment an additional and extensive reduction of the total amount of exhaust gas from MBT plants can be achieved by a more effective usage of oxygen in the air and by a more effective energy removal. To what extent both factors can be varied without interfering the rotting process was examined by laboratory and pilot plant studies. The results are pointing to the potential of exhaust gas reduction at MBT plants considering previous control factors and help keeping the standards. The multiple-shift usage of exhaust gas from several plant components of MBT and the thereby caused increase of organic carbon concentrations affects an economical and associated with this an additional ecological benefit. The RTO technology needs energy to maintain the oxidation process. This energy can be supplied by external energy sources or by the energy content of the pollutants in the waste gas. Chapter 5 gives theoretical calculations that show that an autothermic operation could be reached when the organic carbon concentrations exceed 500 to 1. 000 mg/m" 3 depending on the energy content adopted to carbons in the crude gas. Finally, the collected results are brought together against the background of MBT technology and chances as well as risks that arise from the experimental results appreciated. (orig.)

40|$|During the {{manufacture}} of wood composites, paper, {{and to a lesser}} extent, lumber, large amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as terpenes, formaldehyde, and methanol are emitted to air. Some of these compounds are hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The air pollutants produced in the forest products industry are difficult to manage because the concentrations are very low. Presently, <b>regenerative</b> <b>thermal</b> oxidizers (RTOs and RCOs) are commonly used for the destruction of VOCs and HAPs. RTOs consume large amounts of natural gas to heat air and moisture. The combustion of natural gas generates increased CO 2 and NOx, which have negative implications for global warming and air quality. The aforementioned problems are addressed by an absorption system containing a room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) as an absorbent. RTILs are salts, but are in liquid states at room temperature. RTILs, an emerging technology, are receiving much attention as replacements for organic solvents in industrial processes with significant cost and environmental benefits. Some of these processes include organic synthesis, extraction, and metal deposition. RTILs would be excellent absorbents for exhausts from wood products facilities because of their unique properties: no measurable vapor pressure, high solubility of wide range of organic compounds, thermal stability to 200 °C (almost 400 °F), and immisciblity with water. Room temperature ionic liquids were tested as possible absorbents. Four were imidizolium-based and were eight phosphonium-based. The imidizolium-based ionic liquids proved to be unstable at the conditions tested and in the presence of water. The phosphonium-based ionic liquids were stable. Most were good absorbents; however, cleaning the contaminates from the ionic liquids was problematic. This was overcome with a higher temperature (120 °C) than originally proposed and a very low pressure (1 kPa. Absorption trials were conducted with tetradecy(trihexyl) phosphonium dicyanamide as the RTIL. It was determined that it has good absorption properties for methanol and α-pinene, is thermally stable, and is relatively easy to synthesize. It has a density of 0. 89 g/mL at 20 °C and a molecular weight of 549. 9 g/mol. Trials were conducted with a small absorption system and a larger absorption system. Methanol, formaldehyde, and other HAPs were absorbed well, nearly 100 %. Acetaldehyde was difficult to capture. Total VOC capture, while satisfactory on methanol and α-pinene in a lab system, was less than expected in the field, 60 - 80 %. The inability to capture the broad spectrum of total organics is likely due to difficulties in cleaning them from the ionic liquid rather than the ability of the ionic liquid to absorb. It’s likely that a commercial system could be constructed to remove 90 to 100 % of the gas contaminates. Selecting the correct ionic liquid would be key to this. Absorption may not be the main selection criterion, but rather how easily the ionic liquid can be cleaned is very important. The ionic liquid absorption system might work very well in a system with a limited spectrum of pollutants, such as a paint spray line, where there are not very high molecular weight, non volatile, compounds in the exhaust...|$|R
