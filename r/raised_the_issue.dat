5|$|In 1825, Sharp {{resigned}} {{to run for}} {{a seat in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. During the heated campaign, opponents <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of his alleged seduction of Anna Cooke. Old Court partisan John U. Waring had handbills distributed that alleged that Sharp had denied paternity of Cooke's illegitimate child because it was a mulatto and likely fathered by a Cooke family slave. Sharp won the election, defeating John J. Crittenden.|$|E
5|$|In {{his message}} to the {{legislature}} in 1904, Beckham again <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of a uniform school textbook law, which had not passed during his first term. The law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the 1904 session. During the session funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late Governor Goebel.|$|E

5|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} for crews' wages {{to be stopped}} when a ship was sunk.

Citing the crew member who {{was told by the}} Labour exchange to 'go and get his record card', which was lost when Irish Oak sank, he suggested that the Dáil Éireann ask the German Consul-General to send a submarine to retrieve it.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Old Court {{supporters}} again <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of Sharp's seduction and {{abandonment of}} Anna Cooke. Old Court supporter John Upshaw Waring printed handbills {{that not only}} accused Sharp of fathering Cooke's child, but said that Sharp had denied paternity of the child {{on the grounds that}} it was a mulatto and the son of a Cooke family slave. Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been determined. Despite the allegations, Sharp won the election.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1940, Hitler {{considered}} the possibility of occupying the Portuguese Azores, Cape Verde and Madeira and the Spanish Canary islands to deny the British a staging ground for military actions against Nazi-controlled Europe. In September 1940, Hitler further <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> in a discussion with the Spanish Foreign Minister Serrano Súñer, offering now Spain to transfer one of the Canary islands to German usage {{for the price of}} French Morocco. Although Hitler's interest in the Atlantic islands must be understood from a framework imposed by the military situation of 1940, he ultimately had no plans of ever releasing these important naval bases from German control.|$|E

5|$|In 1095, at the Council of Piacenza, Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos {{requested}} {{military aid}} from Pope Urban II, {{probably in the}} form of a small body of mercenary reinforcements he could direct and control. Alexios had restored the Empire's finances and authority, but he still faced a number of foreign enemies, particularly the migrating Turks who had colonised the sparsely populated areas of Anatolia. At the Council of Clermont later that year, Urban <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> again and preached for a Crusade. Many historians consider that Urban also hoped that aiding the Eastern Church would lead to its reunion with the Western under his leadership.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 and 1976 most foreign forces, {{with the}} {{exception}} of Cuba, withdrew. The last elements of the Portuguese military withdrew in 1975 and the South African military withdrew in February 1976. However, Cuba's troop force in Angola increased from 5,500 in December 1975 to 11,000 in February 1976.

5|$|The British and Americans {{exchanged}} nuclear information, but did {{not initially}} combine their efforts.

5|$|Detractors {{have raised}} {{concerns}} over Lichtenstein's appropriation, {{in that he}} directly references imagery from other sources in Whaam! and other works of the period. Some have denigrated it as mere copying, to which others have countered that Lichtenstein altered his sources in significant, creative ways. In response to claims of plagiarism, the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation has noted that publishers have never sued for copyright infringement, and that they never <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> when Lichtenstein's comics-derived work first gained attention in the 1960s. Other criticism centers on Lichtenstein's failure to credit the original artists of his sources; Ernesto Priego implicates National Periodicals {{in the case of}} Whaam!, as the artists were never credited in the original comic books.|$|E
5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{had offered}} to give the United States access to its {{scientific}} research, and Cockcroft, {{as part of the}} Tizard Mission, briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The British and American projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 American offer to create a combined project. In November 1941, Frederick L. Hovde, the head of the London liaison office of the American Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of cooperation and exchange of information with Anderson and Lord Cherwell, who demurred, ostensibly over concerns about American security.

5|$|In {{addition}} to her deputy leadership role, Lamont was appointed Chief of Staff with special responsibility for Equalities. While in that post she gave her support to Scottish Government plans to introduce a Bill outlawing forced marriage, which was announced in September 2010. In February 2011, she criticised Scottish Conservative MSP and Justice Committee Convener, Bill Aitken after the Sunday Herald quoted him making a controversial statement about a rape victim, and later welcomed his subsequent resignation. As Gray's deputy Lamont also represented Labour at First Minister's Questions in his absence. At a session of First Minister's Questions in October 2009, she <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of the Scottish Futures Trust with Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, asking whether the public body planned to spend any money on improving school infrastructure before the 2011 election.|$|E

However, in view of Witherspoon, the court found that the defendants death sentence was unconstitutionally decided. In this third hearing, the court changed its mind and decided the death penalty was cruel or unusual.|$|R

5|$|Reibey was funding {{all of the}} {{construction}} costs. When the structure was mostly complete a scandal erupted around him. He was alleged to have indecently dealt with a married woman. Her husband <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> with the bishop, then in 1870 with no action by the Church again with the Church of England Synod in England. Reibey subsequently took libel action but his complaint was dismissed and the Jury largely held that the allegations against him were true. Apart from these allegations, Reibey's wife's health had been declining, his property had been declining in value, and he wrote {{that he had been}} considering relinquishing the Archdeaconship for a while. After only a few years the lack of funds provided left only one person working on the site. All work ceased in 1870, by which time the walls were unfinished and the building still lacked a roof. Though the church was incomplete both Reibey and his wife Catherine were buried in a graveyard at the building's rear.|$|E
5|$|The ousting of {{the merchants}} from Constantinople {{was a heavy}} blow for Bulgarian {{economic}} interests. The merchants complained to Simeon I, who in turn <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> to Leo VI, but the appeal was left unanswered. Simeon, who according to the Byzantine chroniclers was seeking a pretext to declare war and to implement his plans to seize the Byzantine throne, attacked, provoking what has sometimes been called (inappropriately) the first commercial war in Europe. However, many historians including Vasil Zlatarski and John Fine consider those claims unlikely, arguing that {{in the beginning of}} his reign Simeon needed to consolidate his power and imperial ambitions had not yet been crystallised, therefore his military intervention was a defensive act to protect the Bulgarian commercial interests.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately decided {{under the}} title O'Grady v. Superior Court, the suit filed by Apple against unnamed bloggers <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> {{for the first time}} of whether bloggers hold the same protections against {{revealing}} sources that journalists have. In November 2004, three popular weblog sites featuring Apple rumors publicly revealed information about two unreleased Apple products, the Mac mini and an as yet unreleased product code-named Asteroid, also known as Project Q97. Apple subpoenaed three sites to force them to identify their confidential sources: Apple Insider, Power Page, and, separately, Think Secret, which did no original reporting on the case and thus had no sources to reveal. In February 2005, a trial court in California decided that website operators {{do not have the same}} shield law protection as do other journalists. The journalists appealed and, in May 2006, the California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's decision, ruling that activities in question were covered by the shield law.|$|E

50|$|Rivkin and his {{frequent}} coauthor, Lee Casey, questioned {{the constitutionality of}} government-run healthcare.

In December 2009, Rivkin and Casey <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> of federal aggrandizement and judicial aggrandizement as dangers to the vertical separation of powers in the U.S. Constitution, and suggested a limited constitutional convention to limit the incursion of federal and judicial powers into {{the powers of the}} states.|$|R
5|$|Although the Igor Gouzenko and Elizabeth Bentley affairs had <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of Soviet espionage as {{far back}} as 1945, events in 1949 and 1950 sharply {{increased}} the sense of threat from Communism in the United States. The Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb in 1949, earlier than many analysts had expected. That same year, Mao Zedong's Communist army gained control of mainland China despite heavy American financial support of the opposing Kuomintang. In 1950, the Korean War began, pitting U.S., U.N., and South Korean forces against Communists from North Korea and China. The following year also saw several significant developments regarding Soviet Cold War espionage activities. In January 1950, Alger Hiss, a high-level State Department official, was convicted of perjury. Hiss was in effect found guilty of espionage; the statute of limitations had run out for that crime, but he was convicted of having perjured himself when he denied that charge in earlier testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. In Great Britain, Klaus Fuchs confessed to committing espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union while working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory during the War. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested in 1950 on charges of stealing atomic bomb secrets for the Soviets and were executed in 1953.|$|E
5|$|In April 1955, a Caltrans {{official}} {{announced that}} US 80 {{would be built}} as a freeway for its entire length in California, {{as it was to}} be included in the Interstate Highway System. In the meantime, while plans moved further along on US 101, the mayor of San Diego asked the California Highway Commission to keep the US 80 project on track. However, the construction was put on hold because of lower traffic levels on US 80, compared to other local highways. State Assemblyman Hegland <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> in the Assembly Highway subcommittee in December, stating that the construction of the freeway would help the economy and the Port of San Diego. State Senator Collier went even further and blamed the delay on San Diego County officials, in addition to linking the delay to damaging the program to develop the port. The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956, at a cost of $1.2 million, and was in use until 1978, when the I-8 bridge was built.|$|E
5|$|In September {{questions}} were asked in the House of Commons about the incident, by which time Constantine had decided to take legal action. In June 1944 Constantine v Imperial London Hotels was heard in the High Court. Although there was no law against racial discrimination in Britain at the time, Constantine argued that the hotel had breached its contract with him. Constantine informed the court that {{the attitude of the}} hotel changed between his booking and arrival, owing to the presence of white American servicemen. The defence argued that they had met their contract by accommodating Constantine in another hotel and that he had left the Imperial voluntarily. The managing director of the hotel denied that racist language had been used. After two days of evidence, the judge found in Constantine's favour, rejecting the defence's arguments and praising the way Constantine had handled the situation. Although the law limited the award of damages against the hotel to five guineas, Constantine was vindicated. He did not pursue the case any further as he believed he had sufficiently <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of racism in the public eye; the case was widely reported in the press, and Constantine received great support from both the public and the government.|$|E
