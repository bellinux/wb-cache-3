40|$|Complex {{coordinate}} scaling (CCS) is used {{to calculate}} resonance eigenvalues and eigenstates for a system consisting of an inverted Gaussian potential and a monochromatic driving field. Floquet eigenvalues and Husimi distributions of resonance eigenfunctions are calculated using two different versions of CCS. The number of <b>resonance</b> <b>states</b> in this system increases as the strength of the driving field is increased, indicating that this system might have increased stability against ionization when the field strength is very high. We find that the newly created <b>resonance</b> <b>states</b> are scarred on unstable periodic orbits of the classical motion. The behavior of these periodic orbits as the field strength is increased may explain why there are more <b>resonance</b> <b>states</b> at high field strengths than at low field strengths. Close examination of an avoided crossing between <b>resonance</b> <b>states</b> shows that this type of avoided crossing does not delocalize the <b>resonance</b> <b>states,</b> although it may lead to interesting effects at certain field strengths.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{transmission}} through different small systems {{as a function}} of the coupling strength v to the two attached leads. The leads are identical with only one propagating mode ξ^E_C in each of them. Besides the conductance G, we calculate the phase rigidity ρ of the scattering wave function Ψ^E_C in the interior of the system. Most interesting results are obtained in the regime of strongly overlapping <b>resonance</b> <b>states</b> where the crossover from staying to traveling modes takes place. The crossover is characterized by collective effects. Here, the conductance is plateau-like enhanced in some energy regions of finite length while corridors with zero transmission (total reflection) appear in other energy regions. This transmission picture depends only weakly on the spectrum of the closed system. It is caused by the alignment of some <b>resonance</b> <b>states</b> of the system with the propagating modes ξ^E_C in the leads. The alignment of <b>resonance</b> <b>states</b> takes place stepwise by resonance trapping, i. e. it is accompanied by the decoupling of other <b>resonance</b> <b>states</b> from the continuum of propagating modes. This process is quantitatively described by the phase rigidity ρ of the scattering wave function. Averaged over energy in the considered energy window, is correlated with 1 -.

40|$|International audienceIn {{ballistic}} open quantum systems one often {{observes that}} the resonances in the complex-energy plane form a clear chain structure.

Using an efficient scattering approach we observe that <b>resonance</b> <b>states</b> along one chain are clearly correlated while <b>resonance</b> <b>states</b> of different chains show an anticorrelation. Studying the phase space representations of the <b>resonance</b> <b>states</b> we find that their localization in phase space oscillate between different regions of the classical trapped set as one moves along the chains and that these oscillations are connected to a modulation of the resonance spacing. A single resonance chain is thus no WKB quantization of a single periodic orbits, but the structure of several oscillating chains arises from the interaction of several periodic orbits.

40|$|XUV {{nonlinear}} spectroscopy {{has recently}} {{discovered that there}} is more than one collective dipole <b>resonance</b> <b>state</b> in the energy range of the giant dipole resonance (GDR) of atomic Xe. This resonance-state substructure, hidden in the linear regime, raises imminent questions regarding our understanding of the collective electronic behavior of Xe, which has been largely founded on linear spectroscopic studies. Here, we approach the collective response of Xe from a new perspective: we study directly the resonance eigenstates, and then analyze their spectroscopic manifestations. We find that linear spectroscopy captures only partial information on the resonance substructure as a result of quantum interferences. Moreover, we show that the <b>resonance</b> <b>state</b> dominating the GDR in linear spectroscopy has no adiabatic connection to the <b>resonance</b> <b>state</b> governing the corresponding cross section when multielectron interactions are neglected. Going beyond the dipole-allowed correlated electronic structure, we predict the existence of collective multipole resonances of Xe.
