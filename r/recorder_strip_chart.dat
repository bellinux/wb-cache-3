5000|$|Lippold discerned that an 8-12 Hz range {{physiological}} tremor {{was associated}} with the contraction of human muscles indicated a connection between psychological stress and its effect on the human body. On September 5, 1972, three retired U.S. Army officers—Allan D. Bell Jr., Wilson H. Ford, and Charles R. McQuiston—filed a U.S. patent under their corporation name, Dektor Counterintelligence and Security, Inc. for their “physiological response analysis method and apparatus.”. Bell's expertise was in counterintelligence, Ford's was in electronics, and McQuiston's was in polygraphy. Ford had invented an electronic device that utilized the theory of Lippold, Halliday, and Redfearn in which he tape-recorded the human voice, slowed it down to one-third or one-fourth its normal rate, and fed it through several low pass filters which then fed the signal into an EKG <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> <b>recorder.</b> The <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> <b>recorder</b> then made chart tracings on heat-sensitive paper. Their Psychological Stress Evaluator (PSE) was the first commercially available VSA. According to Allan Bell Enterprises, [...] "All lie-detection examinations or evaluations are predicated upon the fact that telling a significant lie will produce some degree of psychological stress. Psychological stress, in turn, causes a number of physiological changes.".|$|R

40|$|We believe 3 D {{information}} visualization has {{the power}} to unlock new levels of productivity in the monitoring and control of complex processes. Our goal is to provide visual methods to allow for rapid human insight into systems consisting of thousands to millions of parameters. We explore this hypothesis in two complex domains: NASA program management and NASA International Space Station (ISS) spacecraft computer operations. We seek to extend a common form of visualization called the <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> from 2 D to 3 D. A <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> can display the time series progression of a parameter and allows for trends and events to be identified. <b>Strip</b> <b>charts</b> can be overlayed when multiple parameters need to visualized in order to correlate their events. When many parameters are involved, the direct overlaying of <b>strip</b> <b>charts</b> can become confusing and may not fully utilize the graphing area to convey the relationships between the parameters. We provide a solution to this problem by generating 3 D surfaces from parameterized <b>strip</b> <b>charts.</b> The 3 D surface utilizes significantly more screen area to illustrate the differences in the parameters and the overlayed <b>strip</b> <b>charts,</b> and it can rapidly be scanned by humans to gain insight. The selection of the third dimension must be a parallel or parameterized homogenous resource in the target domain, defined using a finite, ordered, enumerated type, and not a heterogeneous type. We demonstrate our concepts with examples from the NASA program management domain (assessing the state of many plans) and the computers of the ISS (assessing the state of many computers). We identify 2 D <b>strip</b> <b>charts</b> in each domain and show how to construct the corresponding 3 D surfaces. The user can navigate the surface, zooming in on regions of interest, setting a mark and drilling down to source documents from which the data points have been derived.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{aimed at}} automatic detection and digitalisation of the rainfall signal recorded by float based rain gauges on paper <b>strip</b> <b>charts</b> is presented. The algorithm consists of several steps that gradually {{lead to the}} desired goal. The rainfall signal is extracted from the digital image of the <b>strip</b> <b>chart.</b> By cooperation of moving average method and curve edge following method the rainfall curve is detected and uniquely determined - in each image column there is one single point representing the rainfall curve plotline. From the curve plotline high resolution rainfall time series is obtained. Beside image analysis techniques {{in the design of}} the algorithm, the mechanical features of the recording instrument have been taken into consideration. The availability of high resolution rainfall time series is required in many applications, including rainfall classifcation, analysis of extreme rainfall events, calibration of raifall-runoff models, weather prediction models and many research projects. The algorithm has been tesed on 58 pluviograph <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> images. The comparison between the data obtained by the proposed algorithm and the official data from the Environmental Agency of the Republic of Slovenia shows that the algorithm usually accurately detects the rainfall curve and consequently an accurate rainfall time series is obtained.

40|$|The {{output current}} from a {{metastable}} ionization detector (MID) {{is applied to}} a modulation voltage circuit. An adjustment is made to balance out the background current, and an output current, above background, is applied to an input of a <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> <b>recorder.</b> For low level concentrations, i. e., low detected output current, the ionization potential will be at a maximum and the metastable ionization detector will operate at its most sensitive level. When the detected current from the metastable ionization detector increases above a predetermined threshold level, a voltage control circuit is activated which turns on a high voltage transistor which acts to reduce the ionization potential. The ionization potential applied to the metastable ionization detector is then varied so as to maintain the detected signal level constant. The variation in ionization potential is now related to the concentration of the constituent and a representative amplitude is applied to another input of said <b>strip</b> <b>chart</b> <b>recorder...</b>|$|R
