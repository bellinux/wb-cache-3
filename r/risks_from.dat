5|$|Domesticated rats are physiologically {{and psychologically}} {{different}} from their wild relatives, and—when acquired from reputable breeders and shops—pose no more of a health risk than other common pets. For example, domesticated brown rats are not considered a disease threat, while exposure to wild rat populations could introduce pathogens like Salmonella into the home. Fancy rats experience different health <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> their wild counterparts, and thus {{are less likely to}} succumb to many of the same illnesses as wild rats.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{disasters}} {{and other natural}} occurrences are also sources of mortality. The West Indian manatee and Dugong face <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> hurricanes and cyclones, which are predicted to increase in the future. These storms may also damage seagrass populations. Exposure to brevetoxin from Karenia brevis during a red tide event are also sources of mortality; {{they may be able}} to be exposed to brevetoxin after a red tide has subsided, as it could settle on seagrasses. African manatees can become stranded during the dry season when rivers and lakes become too small or dry up completely.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, an {{independent}} Health Advisory Panel - appointed by then-Governor Roy Romer - oversaw {{a series of}} reports, called the Historical Public Exposure Studies. The 12-member Health Advisory Panel included multiple medical doctors, scientists, PhDs, and local officials. The Rocky Flats Historical Public Exposure Studies involved nine years of research. The Studies had three main objectives: (1) create a public record of plant operations and accidents that contributed to contaminant releases from the Rocky Flats Plant between 1952 and 1989; (2) assess public exposures to contaminants and potential <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> past releases; and, (3) determine the need for future studies. The Studies' research included identification and assessment of chemicals and radioactive materials from past releases; estimates of risk to residents living or working in surrounding communities during the Plant's operation from 1952 to 1989; an evaluation of possible exposure pathways; and, dose assessments for historical releases.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{a cohort}} study of 467,450 Danish {{children}} found no association between TCVs and autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), nor any dose-response relationship between thiomersal and ASDs {{that would be}} suggestive of toxic exposure. An ecological analysis that studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with autism likewise did not show an association between autism and thiomersal. A retrospective cohort study on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and autism, but a possible increased risk for tics. Analysis in this study also showed a possible protective effect with respect to general developmental disorders, attention-deficit disorder, and otherwise unspecified developmental delay. Another UK study based on a prospective cohort of 13,617 children likewise found more associated benefits than <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> thiomersal exposure with respect to developmental disorders. Because the Danish and UK studies involved only diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccines, they are less relevant for the higher thiomersal exposure levels {{that occurred in the}} U.S.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study {{by researchers at}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. The findings from this study suggest that, in comparison to the typical American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the risk of death from Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male. The study also compared mortality <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. This {{may be due to the}} increased momentum of collisions from speed players.|$|E
5|$|The Bank offers {{flexible}} loans with maturities {{as long as}} 30 {{years and}} custom-tailored repayment scheduling. The IBRD also offers loans in local currencies. Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option {{which serves as a}} line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program. Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations. The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps. To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic <b>risks</b> <b>from</b> borrowers to investors. The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.|$|E
