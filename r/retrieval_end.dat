The conceptual design was done by the University of Missouri-Rolla in FY 1995 - 96. The university researchers conducted separate effects tests of the component concepts, scaled the basic design features, and constructed a full-scale test article incorporating their findings in early FY 1996. The test article was extensively evaluated in the Hanford Hydraulic Testbed and the design features were further refined. Detail design of the prototype item was started at Waterjet Technology, Inc. before the development testing was finished, and two of the three main subassemblies were substantially complete before final design of the waterjet manifold was determined from the Hanford hydraulic testbed (HTB) testing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Music {{performance}} {{requires that}} musicians represent many differ-ent kinds of sequence structure: musicians must remember which pitch to pro-duce, when to produce it, {{and how to}} produce it (with what movements). The time course of item retrieval and movement preparation processes during music performance are considered. Serially ordered stage models of retrieval, in which item <b>retrieval</b> <b>ends</b> before movement preparation begins, are com-pared with interactive cascade models, in which {{the time course of}} both pro-cesses overlap, permitting interaction. Evidence from transfer of learning paradigms, production errors, and anticipatory movements, as measured in motion capture, are described. This early evidence suggests different time courses for item retrieval (slower, earlier) than for movement preparation (faster, later) with significant temporal overlap during music performance...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} part of a two-part article that reviews 25 years of {{published}} research findings on end-user searching in online information retrieval (IR) systems. In Part 1 (Markey, 2007), the author seeks to answer the following questions: What characterizes the queries that end users submit to online IR systems? What search fea-tures do people use? What features would enable them to improve on the retrievals they have in hand? What features are hardly ever used? What do end users do in response to the system’s <b>retrievals?</b> Are <b>end</b> users sat-isfied with their online searches? Summarizing searches of online IR systems by the search features people use everyday makes information retrieval appear to be a very simplistic one-stop event.

40|$|Abstract. Given its importance, {{the problem}} of object {{discovery}} in High-Resolution Remote-Sensing (HRRS) imagery {{has been given a}} lot of attention by image retrieval researchers. Despite the vast amount of expert endeavor spent on this problem, more effort has been expected to discover and utilize hidden semantics of images for image <b>retrieval.</b> To this <b>end,</b> in this paper, we exploit a hyperclique pattern discovery method to find complex objects that consist of several co-existing individual objects that usually form a unique semantic concept. We consider the identified groups of co-existing objects as new feature sets and feed them into the learning model for better performance of image retrieval. Experiments with real-world datasets show that, with new semantic features as starting points, we can improve the performance of object discovery in terms of various external criteria. ...|$|R

In addition we discuss {{the extent to which}} query shifting may provide better performances than feature weighting and provide experimental results about the "complementarity" of the two approaches.
