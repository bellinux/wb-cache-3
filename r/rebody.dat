50|$|Often, a bus builder will {{embark on}} a <b>rebody</b> programme, such as the East Lancs Greenway, where an {{existing}} chassis receives a new body to extend the usable life of the bus. Sometimes this is done by a manufacturer on a piecemeal basis, leading to odd one-off designs.|$|E
5000|$|The army also requisitioned many Admirals {{directly}} {{before the}} outbreak of war, either {{in order to use}} them as officers' [...] "staff cars", or in order to cut away the back portion of the car body directly behind the b-pillar and <b>rebody</b> the cars as ambulances or light trucks.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{identify}} the nature of bonds established between protein particles after stirring that are responsible for the texture improvement of stirred yoghurts, called <b>rebodying.</b> Using a constant model yoghurt at pH 4 · 4, the effects of changes in the physicochemical conditions at stirring were studied on the subsequent <b>rebodying.</b> Short term <b>rebodying</b> was measured as the changes in viscoelastic properties at 4 °C during 20 h after stirring, while long-term <b>rebodying</b> was measured as the viscosity changes during 28 d storage at 4 °C. Moreover, stirred gels obtained from either set gels that were allowed time or not for ionic equilibration were compared. Increasing or decreasing ionic strength did not change the properties of stirred gels. Calcium chloride addition significantly decreased G′ 0 h, G′ 20 h and tan 20 h but did not induce changes in the gel microstructure as observed by confocal scanning microscopy. Yoghurt <b>rebodying</b> could not be explained by fulfilling ionic equilibrium. Moreover, N-ethyl maleimide addition had no effect on the stirred yoghurt. Attractive electrostatic and disulphide interactions were not involved in the gel <b>rebodying</b> and increasing calcium concentration in the set gel limited <b>rebodying...</b>|$|R
50|$|A large {{proportion}} of the Flyte's orders were for the <b>rebodying</b> of older chassis and this model has a double-curvature windscreen with an arched top and a rounded roof dome. In the severely dwindling market for step-entrance <b>rebodies,</b> the Flyte was superseded by the East Lancs Myllennium-based Hyline around 2000-2001.|$|R
500|$|In 2009, the {{small-scale}} German manufacturer, Bitter, {{which specializes}} in <b>rebodying</b> existing vehicles, unveiled its [...] "Vero Sport" [...] at the Geneva Motor Show. It {{was based on the}} Commodore SS and its production ended in 2012.|$|R
5000|$|The chassis was {{designed}} specifically to allow coachbuilders to <b>rebody</b> it, the most notable {{of which was the}} Zagato designed, 1900 Super Sprint coupé, with an improved engine and custom body design. The Alfa Romeo 1900M AR51 (or [...] "Matta") is a four-wheel drive off-road vehicle based on the 1900-series.|$|E
50|$|Pullip and her companions can {{be given}} new bodies in a process called rebodying. Popular rebodying options include 1:6 scale bodies made by {{companies}} such as Obitsu, Volks, and Pure Neemo. Some collectors prefer to <b>rebody</b> with 1:6 scale action figure bodies or with playline doll bodies, such from Barbie or Liv dolls.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., {{there are}} four {{companies}} that offered Hummer-look-alike <b>rebody</b> kits that can be mated to GM fullsize trucks and Suburban chassis and, in some cases, Ford, Dodge, and even Cadillac applications. Some models are; Urban Gorilla from Urban Manufacturing, Endeavor SB400 and SB4x400 from Forever Off-Road, the Jurassic Truck Corporation T-Rex, and the Bummer from Tatonka Products An additional company offers plans so for chassis building. The kits range from two-door fiberglass models to steel tube and sheet metal constructions.|$|E
25|$|A large {{following}} {{of owners}} still exists with many web pages, groups, and clubs {{devoted to the}} car, and the basic chassis is commonly used as a kit-car platform from wild custom <b>rebodies</b> to Ferrari Testarossa and Ferrari F355 replicas.|$|R
50|$|At the March 2015 Geneva Motor Show Carrozzeria Touring {{unveiled}} the Touring Berlinetta Lusso, a one-off two-seater, three-box coupé {{based on the}} F12berlinetta. Carrozzeria Touring made the car on a client's request, <b>rebodying</b> the F12 in aluminium alloys and carbon fibre; a small production run of five examples was announced.|$|R
50|$|Bitter specialises in <b>rebodying</b> other manufacturer's {{vehicles}} and its initial production was between 1973 and 1989, selling vehicles in Europe and the United States. Thereafter, several prototypes followed {{with an eye}} on resuming low-volume production, but none of those plans came to fruition until the launch of the Bitter Vero in 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth-generation}} Cortina was a {{more conventional}} design than its predecessor, but this was largely appreciated by fleet buyers. Generally a <b>rebody</b> of the Mark III, as an integration of Ford's model range, this car was really a rebadged Ford Taunus. However, although the updated Taunus was introduced to Continental Europe in January 1976, Ford were able to continue selling the Cortina Mark III in undiminished numbers in the UK until {{they were ready to}} launch its successor as the Dagenham built Cortina Mark IV, which went on sale on 29 September 1976.|$|E
50|$|Largely {{an update}} of the Mark IV, {{it was really}} a step between a {{facelift}} and a <b>rebody.</b> The Mark V differentiated itself from the Mark IV by having revised headlights with larger turn indicators incorporated (which were now visible on the side too), a wider slatted grille said to be more aerodynamically efficient, a flattened roof, larger glass area, slimmer C-pillars with revised vent covers, larger slatted tail lights (on saloon models) and upgraded trim. The styling upgrades were done primarily to bring the Cortina into line with Ford's current design language seen on the Fiesta MkI, Capri MkIII and the forthcoming Escort MkIII.|$|E
50|$|In the 1963 {{season the}} Cavalier faced {{internal}} {{competition from the}} Grenadier (see below) but 21 of the 31 ft 5in version and 49 of the 36 ft were sold. Existing customers who placed repeat orders for the short Cavalier were Southdown (4 Leopard L2), Greenslades (another Reliance), Grey Green's orders included a short Reliance and ten Leopard L2 and Harris of Greys, Summerbee of Southampton and McIntyre of Aberdeen all took further Reliances, Harris' being a <b>rebody</b> of a 1958 chassis damaged in an accident. New customers for the 31 ft 5in Cavalier were Munden of Bristol (Leopard L2) and Crump of Pinner (Reliance). A new option was fixed side glazing and forced ventilation. Southdown having this on its Leopards.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the {{small-scale}} German manufacturer, Bitter, {{which specializes}} in <b>rebodying</b> existing vehicles for sale in Europe, resumed its operations by launching the [...] "Vero" [...] at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show. It was based on WM series Caprice (WM) sedans, {{believed to have been}} purchased directly from Holden thanks to Erich Bitter's friendship with Holden's former Peter Hannenberger. It featured extra luxury fittings and a revised exterior, and its production ended in 2012.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} body {{produced by}} Buchanan was a fibreglass item {{based on an}} Aston Martin DB3-S racing car. Buchanan borrowed a DB3-S and pulled moulds from it while it was in Australia. The styling was altered by filling in the scallops {{either side of the}} bonnet and reshaping the grille opening to be oval. Because the target market was for <b>rebodying</b> of early model MGs, the Buchanan moulds were cut and extended between the door openings and the rear wheelarches, adding several centimetres to the body length.|$|R
50|$|After {{the show}} {{the body was}} removed from the second {{demonstrator}} and fitted on a production chassis. It was to be the first of many Ribble Tiger Cubs, whilst Midland Red never purchased new examples of the type. The debodied chassis was updated to production specification and sent to Walter Alexander Coachbuilders, Stirling for bodying as a demonstrator until 1956 when it was sold to Stark's Motor Services, Dunbar. Many later Tiger Cubs were rebodied, generally after accident damage, but occasionally when a coach operator wanted a more up to date appearance. The last such <b>rebodying</b> was done for Western Welsh by Willowbrook in 1971.|$|R
50|$|A recent privately {{commissioned}} custom {{example was}} the Ferrari P4/5 of 2006, a one-car <b>rebody</b> (changing the exterior design) of the Enzo Ferrari {{according to the}} client's specifications. Its design began in September 2005 with sketches by Jason Castriota moving through computer aided sculpture and stringent wind tunnel testing. More than 200 components were designed especially for the car though the engine, drivetrain and many other components are simply modified from the original Enzo Ferrari. The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is unchanged from the Enzo it was derived from. The P4/5 was publicly revealed on August 18, 2006 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance and shown again at the Paris Motor Show in late September. Another recent prototype is the Pininfarina Nido, a two-seater sub-compact that could possibly make airbags obsolete.|$|E
5000|$|Since Carrozzeria Touring, {{the company}} that {{designed}} Lamborghini's chassis, was bankrupt, Carrozzeria Marazzi was the next logical choice as it was funded by Mario Marazzi, an old employee of Touring. The design was essentially a <b>rebody</b> of the 400GT, but the track was altered to allow for wider tires and while the Islero's body suffered {{from a lack of}} proper fit between the panels, its good outward visibility, roomier interior, and much improved soundproofing made it an improvement over previous models. It had a [...] 4.0 L (3929 cc) V12 engine, a five-speed transmission, fully independent suspension, and disc brakes. Its top speed was rated at 154 mph and acceleration from zero to 60 mph took 6.4 seconds. Only 125 Isleros were built. When leaving the factory the Islero originally fitted Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72).|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} Seddon Pennine 7s have been {{preserved}} and are stored at bus museums in Scotland. Among preserved examples {{one of the}} Eastern M types survives at the Scottish Vintage Bus Museum. MSF750P is the only Alexander M-Type bodied coach fully restored. Y-type, T-type and Plaxton-bodied examples also survive, some preserved, some in non-psv roles. Only one Pennine 7 {{is known to have}} been rebodied, former Western MSJ388P which was purchased by a Lancashire businessman in the late 1980s for conversion into a racing car transporter, the Alexander T-type body proved unsound so the businessman, Andrew Wareing, asked Duple to <b>rebody</b> it, they politely declined, having never bodied the type, so one of Mr Wareing's employees, aided by a friend who worked at Duple, were tasked with building a new body which features a number of Duple 320 components, this vehicle, re-registered 5887AW, has been in use as a car transporter for over 20 years.|$|E
50|$|The {{most notable}} example though was the {{commercial}} lengthening and <b>rebodying</b> operation ran by Audlem, Cheshire based dealer Les Gleave Ltd. Between 1961 and 1964 they converted at least 20 Royal Tiger chassis to the full-length allowed {{by a recent}} change in the law, for a cost of £200 for the conversion work; these all received new registrations and a stretch in the wheelbase to 18 ft 6in, Gleave then sent the coach chassis to Scarborough for new 36 ft Plaxton Panorama bodies (one for Harrison of Morecambe, was shown at the 1962 Blackpool Coach Rally with the apt dealer re-registration 2048LG)(Audlem was covered by the Cheshire county vehicle licensing office whose index marks included LG).|$|R
2500|$|ETCE {{carried out}} a program of heavy {{rebuilding}} of 18 Pullmans, much more extensive than the earlier rebuildings and effectively a full <b>rebodying,</b> for use exclusively on its new ETS system; these were renumbered into the series 101–118. [...] The Santiago system opened on 24 December 1991, using four ex-Zürich vehicles (renumbered 501–504) and the first few of the rebodied Pullmans. [...] Within two months, these had been joined in Santiago by eight brand-new Chinese [...] "Shenfeng" [...] trolleybuses (601–608) from Norinco, which ETCE/ETS purchased after evaluating a prototype Shenfeng vehicle in Valparaíso in early 1990. [...] China has had several trolleybus manufacturers, and these nine units for ETCE/ETS were notable in being the first Chinese-built trolleybuses ever exported outside of Asia.|$|R
50|$|Deliveries of Duple {{bodywork}} on full-sized chassis (such as the AEC Regal) {{began in}} May 1946, and {{were known as}} the A-type, although its curved lines had their origin in the prewar period, {{so it was not}} strictly a new design. Before long the order book was filled for several years ahead. Postwar <b>rebodying</b> became common practice as new chassis were initially hard to obtain and Duple built many A-type bodies on different chassis that helped to make it, with its distinctive side 'flash', a familiar sight in postwar Britain. Alternative styles were available, all with alphabetic codes, such as the B-type and C-types, which differed in detail only and were regarded as 'dual-purpose' bodies, whilst the D-type was Duple's own design of bus body.|$|R
5000|$|At the 1950 Earls Court Show Burlingham had two {{new coach}} designs on Royal Tiger and AEC Regal IV chassis, both shown with a luxury 37-seat seating plan in their central-entrance bodies, when 39 or 41 {{would have been}} the more likely choice of all but the most-upmarket customers. The designs were related, having similar {{detailing}} and windscreens, and an identical cast chromium-plated frontal motif, but the AEC had traditional teardrop-shape wheel-arch mouldings and a straight waist rail with vertical window pillars, whilst the Leyland [...] had a curved waist rail, window pillars angled back from the vertical and an ellipsoid moulding sweeping from the front {{to the rear of the}} coach; this feature was known internally as the 'tank panel' because of its resemblance in shape to a World War One tank. This second coach was finished in the livery of its customer Woods of Blackpool, who traded as Seagull Coaches. Show visitors asked Burlingham for the style with the seagull on the side, and this (despite some chagrin at Woods) soon evolved into the marque name for the style. The previous body was still available for vertical-engined heavyweights but also to the new 30 ft length, and only in full-front form, with the tank-panel and front chrome motif as options. 1951 would be last season of a style with its origins in the late 1930s. For the Seagull, though, it was the start of a prosperous decade. In 1994 it came second in the Classic Bus reader poll to find the most attractive coach body style of all time. It was by far the most successful type of coach body for the early underfloor-engined chassis, selling well on Royal Tiger, Regal IV and Daimler Freeline chassis, Daimler choosing the Seagull style for LKV218, its coach demonstrator. Two were also fitted to Foden rear-engined coaches. From 1952 variants were introduced for vertical-engined chassis, starting with a style for the initial Bedford SB, a 35-seat version with a lengthened rear overhang. Shortly afterwards Scottish Omnibuses (as SMT had become) requested a version to fit Bedford OB chassis converted to forward control; these were known as 'baby Seagulls' and went to SOL and its Highland Omnibuses subsidiary. SOL also took Seagulls to <b>rebody</b> formerly half-cab AEC Regal IIIs. Others who ordered very large numbers of the style were Ribble and many other BET group members and independent coach operators, the largest customer from that sector being Wallace Arnold.|$|E

50|$|In 1984, Bitter {{announced}} at the New York Auto Show that it would enter into a limited marketing agreement with GM to sell the sedan version in the United States, through participating Buick dealerships. By being able to offer a premium European product, GM had hoped to (re)gain market share lost to BMW at the time. The option of importing Opel cars was dismissed {{on the basis that}} it was perceived to be an entry-level brand, relative to BMW's premium status. Ultimately, less than a dozen Buick dealers (mostly in the metro New York City area), would bear the Bitter signage as a result of which sales proved minimal. Bitter's failure was based on its business model, and the diminishing trend of <b>rebodying</b> other manufacturers' vehicles, which became unpopular by the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|Suzuki's {{first move}} on {{acquiring}} {{the rights to}} the ON360 was <b>rebodying</b> it and replacing the Mitsubishi engine with an air-cooled [...] Suzuki [...] "FB" [...] two-cylinder two-stroke which produced [...] Since the new unit remained smaller than 360 cc, and Suzuki placed the spare tire inside the truck (making it a three-seater) to keep it under 3 meters in overall length, it was classified as a kei car, conferring certain tax privileges and other benefits. When it was introduced in April 1970 it was the first four-wheel drive kei car to enter series production. The LJ10 Jimnys had sixteen-inch wheels, weighed 590 kg, and had a top speed of 75 km/h. The engine was soon uprated to a [...] version, but the claimed top speed remained unchanged.|$|R
2500|$|Initially, Alfa Romeo {{announced}} that the 8C {{was not to be}} sold to private owners, but by autumn 1931 Alfa sold it as a rolling chassis in Lungo (long) or Corto (short) form with prices starting at over £1000. The chassis were fitted with bodies from a selection of [...] Italian coach-builders (Carrozzeria) such as Zagato, Carrozzeria Touring, Carrozzeria Castagna, Pininfarina and Brianza, even though Alfa Romeo did make bodies. Some chassis were clothed by coach-builders such as Graber, Worblaufen and Tuscher of Switzerland and Figoni of France. Alfa Romeo also had a practice of <b>rebodying</b> cars for clients, and some racing vehicles were sold rebodied as road vehicles. Some of the famous first owners include Baroness Maud Thyssen of the Thyssen family, the owner of the aircraft and now scooter company Piaggio Andrea Piaggio, Raymond Sommer, and Tazio Nuvolari.|$|R
5000|$|As well as total <b>rebodying,</b> some {{operators}} {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s took mid-life central-entrance Royal Tiger coaches and modified them to dual-purpose (i.e. buses adapted for longer-distance service routes which could also serve as private hire coaches) by converting them to front from centre entrance. Single deckers by that time could legally be worked driver-only, which by halving staff costs saved some rural routes from abandonment. Harper Brothers of Heath Hayes mentioned above fitted very utilitarian fronts to some Burlingham Seagull bodied Royal Tigers for the purpose whilst Walter Alexander & Sons converted some of its Royal Tiger coach fleet in-house (those with Alexander bodies) [...] and had two of its Leyland-bodied examples refitted with the contemporary (late 1950s) Walter Alexander Coachbuilders front end assemblies which produced incongruous-looking but doubtless useful service coaches.|$|R

50|$|The Hyline {{body was}} {{designed}} to re-body reconditioned Leyland Tiger and Volvo B10M chassis. Six Leyland Tigers were rebodied in 2000 as Myllennium Hylines for Strathtay. These 12m Tigers hit the road and were used {{on a variety of}} services from local work to distant coach services. Two further orders were placed, both for Volvo B10M chassis. Looking rather different from the Strathtay examples, the Volvos was built with bonded glazing and had the emergency exit located at the very rear off side. The concept was not a great success, as a result no further orders followed - the Hylines representing the end in the UK of <b>rebodying</b> for the bus industry. It was built like the Myllennium single-decker but for high-floor buses and thus, it could not be ordered with any new, low floor chassis. The body was discontinued in 2002.|$|R
25|$|Whilst {{retaining}} {{the dimensions of}} the Titan TD7 and Tiger TS11, the 1945 Titan PD1 and Tiger PS1 were entirely new designs featuring a new E181 7.4-litre engine with pushrod valve operation and a brand new four-speed constant mesh gearbox. The export versions with an O prefix for overseas markets, the OPS1, not only had longer wheelbases (where legally applicable) but were equipped with the pre-war design overhead-camshaft E87 engine, which had the same nominal 100bhp output but was larger at 8.6 litres. No UK operator took the OPS1 but Potteries Motor Traction took a batch of long-wheelbase OPD1 Titans as single-deckers, later <b>rebodying</b> them as double decks once overall length rules had been relaxed to allow this. When fitted with left-hand drive, the Tiger became the LOPS1, this prefix attaching to all left-hand drive Leyland buses (and Leyland-designed British United Traction trolleybuses) until the mid-1960s when later designs adopted a suffix letter for driving control position.|$|R
50|$|Pullip (풀잎) is {{a fashion}} doll created by Cheonsang Cheonha of South Korea in 2003. Pullip has a jointed plastic body (1:6 scale) and a {{relatively}} oversized head (1:3 scale), with eyes that can move {{from side to}} side and eyelids that can blink. Pullip was first marketed by Jun Planning out of Japan; but the company underwent management changes in early 2009 and, since then, has operated out of South Korea under the name Groove. Since the release of the original female doll, other companion dolls have been added: male dolls Namu (나무, tree) and Taeyang (태양, sun); Taeyang's younger sister, Dal (달, moon); Dal's best friend, Byul (별, star); and Pullip's younger brother, Isul (이슬, dew). In February 2013, a new member of the Pullip family was introduced, called Yeolume (열매, berry/fruit), who is Pullip's future daughter. There is also a miniature line called Little Pullip, with 1:12 scale bodies and 1:6 scale heads. Pullip and her counterpart dolls are often customized by collectors, with the most common customizations including wig changes, eye color changes, and <b>rebodying.</b>|$|R
25|$|In October 1914 the 'Three Towns' were merged {{under the}} auspices of Plymouth Corporation. The lines owned by Devonport Corporation came under the control of Plymouth Corporation, {{and at the same time}} the BET's Devonport and District company was sold to the corporation. The {{following}} year saw connections made between the two networks at Pennycomequick and Peverell. After World War I the old Plymouth tram depots started to be run down while the old Devonport depot at Milehouse was expanded and new offices built there. The facilities provided were capable of undertaking complete rebuilding and <b>rebodying</b> of old tram cars. The Stonehouse line remained independent but the portions of the line in both Plymouth and Devonport had been sold to the respective corporations in 1901 and leased back for 21 years, so when this lease expired in 1922 the company sold out to the Plymouth Corporation. This finally bought all the routes under one ownership. New connections from the Stonehouse line were laid between Derry's Clock with the adjacent Theatre terminus used by most of the Plymouth routes, and at Fore Street with the old Devonport network.|$|R
50|$|Currently the Fiero has a cult {{following}} {{of owners}} and customizers. While all Fiero models {{are considered to}} be collectible, the 1988 model year is particularly sought after by collectors due to its limited production numbers and vastly improved underpinnings. Because of an abundance of replacement parts available from other General Motors vehicles, there are many upgrades {{that can be done to}} improve performance and reliability of the cars. Additionally, a multitude of different General Motors engines have been installed by enthusiasts, from the Quad-4 engine to the Chevrolet small-block V8 to the Cadillac 4.9 L and Northstar V8s. The GM 3800 Supercharged is also a very popular choice, as well as the 3.4 L found in the 1993, 1994, or 1995 Camaro/Firebird. One shop in particular that pioneered and now specializes in V8 installations has even gone so far as to install the famed Z06 Corvette powerplant, the 505 horsepower LS7, into a Fiero. Installation of the 4.9 L V8 or smaller engines is possible with few modifications to the car itself, because Fiero prototypes were tested with a similar small aluminum V8 prior to production. As a result, the engine bay is large enough to accommodate engines of that size.A large following of owners still exists with many web pages, groups, and clubs devoted to the car, and the basic chassis is commonly used as a kit-car platform from wild custom <b>rebodies</b> to Ferrari Testarossa and Ferrari F355 replicas.|$|R
