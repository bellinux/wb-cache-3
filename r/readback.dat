500|$|On September 14, 2010, the NTSB {{released}} its final {{report on the}} incident. The report cited two primary causes of the accident: (1) the [...] "inherent limitations" [...] of the see-and-avoid concept, which meant that from the airplane pilot's point of view, the helicopter would have appeared as a small, stationary object {{against a backdrop of}} the New York City skyline until the final seconds before the collision; and (2) the Teterboro controller's personal phone call, which distracted him from his air traffic control duties and prevented him from correcting the airplane pilot's incorrect <b>readback</b> of the Newark control tower's radio frequency.|$|E

2500|$|Air traffic {{instruction}} {{should not}} be acknowledged solely with a colloquial phrase such as [...] "OK" [...] or even [...] "Roger" [...] (which simply means the last transmission was received), but with a <b>readback</b> of the key parts of the instruction, to show mutual understanding. The phrase [...] "take off" [...] is now spoken only when the actual takeoff clearance is given or when cancelling that same clearance (i.e. [...] "cleared for take-off" [...] or [...] "cancel take-off clearance"). Up until that point, aircrew and controllers should use the phrase [...] "departure" [...] in its place, e.g. [...] "ready for departure". Additionally, an ATC clearance given to an aircraft already lined-up on the runway must be prefixed with the instruction [...] "hold position".|$|E
40|$|Although pilot-controller {{communication}} {{is central to}} aviation safety, this area of aviation human factors has not been extensively researched. Most {{research has focused on}} what kinds of communication problems occur. A more complete picture of communication problems requires understanding how communication usually works in routine operations. A sample of routine pilot-controller communication in the TRACON environment is described. After describing several dimensions of routine communication, three kinds of communication problems are treated: inaccuracies such as incorrect <b>readbacks,</b> procedural deviations such as missing callsigns and <b>readbacks,</b> and nonroutine transactions where pilot and controller must deal with misunderstandings or other communication problems.

50|$|Exchange bias was {{initially}} used {{to stabilize the}} magnetization of soft ferromagnetic layers in <b>readback</b> heads based on the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effect. Without the stabilization, the magnetic domain state of the head could be unpredictable, leading to reliability problems. Currently exchange bias is used to pin the harder reference layer in spin valve <b>readback</b> heads and MRAM memory circuits that utilize the giant magnetoresistance or magnetic tunneling effect. Similarly the most advanced disk media are antiferromagnetically coupled, making use of interfacial exchange to effectively increase the stability of small magnetic particles whose behavior would otherwise be superparamagnetic.|$|E

The author reports on {{the difficult task of}} stabilizing the slow drift component of the orbit motion down to a few microns rms using workstation-based orbit correction. There are two aspects to consider separately the correction algorithm and the configuration of the beam position monitors (BPMs) and correctors. Three notable features of the correction algorithm are: low-pass digital filtering of BPM readbacks; {open_quotes}despiking{close_quotes} of the filtered orbit to desensitize the orbit correction to spurious BPM <b>readbacks</b> without having to change the correction matrix; and BPM intensity-dependent offset compensation. The BPM/corrector configuration includes all of the working BPMs but only a small set of correctors distributed around the ring. Thus only those orbit modes that {{are most likely to be}} representative of real beam drift are handled by the correction algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} the magnets, rf system, and other {{components}} at the Brookhaven Linac uses a system that was developed at Brookhaven in the late 1960 's.

50|$|Printer Job Language (PJL) is {{a method}} {{developed}} by Hewlett-Packard for switching printer languages at the job level, and for status <b>readback</b> between the printer and the host computer.

While PJL was conceived as an extension to Printer Command Language (PCL), it is now supported by most PostScript printers. Many printer vendors have extended PJL to include commands proprietary to their products. Not all PJL commands documented by HP are implemented in all HP or other vendor products. PJL resides above all the other printer languages and parses commands first. The syntax mainly uses plain English words.|$|E
40|$|Pilot-controller {{communication}} {{is critical to}} safe and efficient flight. It is often a challenging component of piloting, which {{is reflected in the}} number of incidents and accidents involving miscommunication. Our previous field study identified communication problems that disrupt routine communication between pilots and controllers. The present part-task simulation study followed up the field results with a more controlled investigation of communication problems. Pilots flew a simulation in which they were frequently vectored by Air Traffic Control (ATC), requiring intensive communication with the controller. While flying, pilots also performed a secondary visual monitoring task. We examined the influence of message length (one message with four commands vs. two messages with two commands each) and noncommunication workload on communication accuracy and length. Longer ATC messages appeared to overload pilot working memory, resulting in more incorrect or partial <b>readbacks,</b> as well as more requests to repeat the message. The timing between the two short messages also influenced communication. The second message interfered with memory for or response to the first short message when it was delivered too soon after the first message. Performing the secondary monitoring task did not influence communication. Instead, communication reduced monitoring accuracy...|$|R
40|$|At the CEBAF accelerator, {{groups of}} dipole magnets are often {{connected}} together in series and powered {{from a single}} large constant-current regulated D-C supply, referred to locally as a {open_quotes}box{close_quotes} supply. Besides the economy realized, this configuration promotes correct field tracking of all elements of a beam transport channel. However, it is often desirable to vary the current in one element of a string independently of the others, particularly at the entrance and exits of transport channels. A 20 ampere programmable current shunt is described. Installed in parallel with the desired magnet, it permits shunting (bypassing) up to 5 % of the string current around that magnet. The shunt regulator consists of a bank of MOSFET power transistors operated in linear mode. Regulation of current through the passbank is obtained by feedback from a manganin shunt maintained at a constant temperature for stability. The module is designed for remote operation and provides <b>readbacks</b> of various parameters useful for maintenance. To achieve complete electrical isolation, an onboard microprocessor provides remote communications via an opto-isolated serial data link. Constructional details and initial operating experience with the plug-in shunt are described...|$|R
40|$|The {{accelerator}} code Xorbit has an interface to the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS). This {{means that}} machine data such as magnet settings {{can be sent}} to Xorbit via EPICS, and the resulting orbit parameters such as beta functions, etc., can be calculated. In addition, Xorbit can be made to simulate the real machine, whether the latter is running or not. To accomplish this for the APS, there is a database of process variables in an IOC corresponding to each APS ring and beamline. These process variables are very similar to the real process variables that read and set power supplies and read monitors, except that when a setting is changed, Xorbit is notified via a callback, calculates a new orbit, and outputs the appropriate <b>readbacks</b> to the database. By attaching the string ``Xorbit:`` to a control name the control system will respond to the simulation rather than the real system. This allows the testing of control algorithms, orbit diagnostics, and many other components of the control system (as well as EPICS itself). It is fast enough to be visually similar to accessing the real system...|$|R

The UK have introduced non-standard R/T phraseology to overcome this difficulty {{but the problem is}} still with us; in 2004 there are 8 recorded occasions where a crew have correctly acknowledged a descent clearance to FL110 but have then descended to FL100. Other events will involve a breakdown in cockpit SOPs; It is not fully understood why this type of event occurs but it is possible that high R/T loading, high cockpit workload and communication issues are all contributory factors.|$|E

40|$|The SNS has {{developed}} a standard power supply interface for the approximately 350 magnet power supplies in the SNS accumulator ring, Linac and transport lines. Power supply manufacturers are providing supplies compatible with the standard interface. The SNS standard consists of a VME based power supply controller module (PSC) and a power supply interface unit (PSI) that mounts on the power supply. Communication {{between the two is}} via a pair of multimode fibers. This PSI/PSC system supports one 16 -bit analog reference, four 16 -bit analog <b>readbacks,</b> fifteen digital commands and sixteen digital status bits in a single fiber-isolated module.

40|$|Introduction The ISOTRACE™ Super-Conducting Cyclotron is PMB-Alcen’s redeveloped and modernized {{version of}} Oxford Instrument’s OSCAR superconducting {{cyclotron}} [1]. Its extracted 80 + mi-croamperes of 12 MeV protons {{are used for}} the production of PET radioisotopes. Following the philosophy of Dickie, Stevenson, Szlavik [2] for minimizing dose to personnel, and as developed by Dehnel et al [3, 4], and Stokely et al [5], the ISOTRACE™ shall utilize an innovative, light-weight, integrated and self-supporting Mini-Beamline. This permits the relatively high residual radiation fields around PET targets to be moved ~ 1 metre away from the cyclotron, and facilitates the use of local shielding (around the targets) that limits prompt gammas and neutrons, but more importantly attenuates the residual target radiation, so that maintenance/research staff can work on the cyclotron in a relatively low activity environment. In addition, the mini-beamline for PET utilizes a compound quadrupole/steerer doublet that permits active and dynamic focusing/steering of the extracted proton beam for optimized production and minimized losses [3], so it improves on the successful work of Theroux et al [6]. The integrated beamline unit is extremely small, so that it is very unlike bulky traditional PET and SPECT beamlines that require substantial support structures, such as described by Dehnel in [7, 8]. Material and Methods The ISOTRACE™ cyclotron is pictured in FIG. 1. The exit port flange and gate valve to which the integrated mini-beamline for PET shall be mounted is shown. Immediately upstream of the exit port, hidden from view, is a 4 jaw collimator (called BPI for Beam Position Indicator) with spilled beam current <b>readbacks</b> to the control system. TABLE 1 shows the nominal beam emittance and Twiss parameter values at the exit port flange location. This ion-optical information is necessary to simulate ion beam transport, develop the mini-beamline, and determine a nominal tune (i. e. magnet settings). Results and Conclusion TABLE 2 shows the ion-optical system parameters. FIGS. 2 and 3 show the horizontal and vertical beam profiles. The Horizontally focusing Quadrupole magnet (HQ), and Vertically focusing Quadrupole magnet (VQ) aperture diameter, 33 mm, was chosen to give sufficient beam acceptance. The focusing strength is a function of BL, so the effective length, L = 150 mm, was chosen to ensure Bmax less than 0. 3 Tesla, while keeping overall magnet mass down. The quad-rupole magnets are fitted with water-cooled compound coils in which the copper/mylar strip wound portion of each coil is a winding for the quadrupole focusing function, and the wire wound portion is for the steering function. To increase beam acceptance and provide additional section strength for the pipe support function, the internal aperture of the low-activation aluminium beam pipe and the external shape are {{in the shape of a}} cross. FIG. 4 shows the beam crosssection at the mid-point of the downstream quadrupole magnet, and illustrates the additional acceptance as compared to a round beampipe. In order to machine the interior profile, the pipe is comprised of two premachined pieces that are friction stirwelded together. FIG. 5 is an isometric of the mini-beamline for PET. The four upstream HQ compound coils are excited with a 75 A power supply for the horizontally focusing quadrupole magnet function, and a ± 10 A power supply for a vertical steering function. The same power supplies are used for the four downstream VQ compound coils for the purpose of a vertically focusing quadrupole magnet function and horizontal steering function...|$|R

50|$|This {{innovation}} has {{the potential}} to provide petabyte-level mass storage on DVD-sized discs (120mm). Data recording and <b>readback</b> are achieved by focusing lasers within the medium. However, because of the volumetric nature of the data structure, the laser light must travel through other data points before it reaches the point where reading or recording is desired. Therefore, some kind of nonlinearity is required to ensure that these other data points do not interfere with the addressing of the desired point.|$|E
