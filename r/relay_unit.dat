30|$|The <b>relay</b> feeder <b>unit</b> which {{connects to}} the base station was {{positioned}} in path G (at a distance of approximately 485 m from the base station). The feeder unit was placed close {{to the window to}} enjoy good channel conditions to the base station. The <b>relay</b> access <b>unit</b> which {{connects to the}} user equipment, was positioned just 1 m away from the feeder unit and used two isotropic antennas at a height of 3 m. An ethernet cable connects the relay feeder and access units. The isolation between the relay feeder and access for 1 m separation at the measurement site and with additional shielding was only about 20 dB. Because of this low isolation, orthogonalization between the two <b>relay</b> <b>units</b> is needed. A simple relay time split strategy was employed for this purpose. The base station to relay link was active for a fixed half of the time slots, and the relay to user equipment was active for remaining time slots within a radio frame of 10 ms.|$|R

50|$|Each Apollo {{spacecraft}} {{was assigned}} a frequency pair. For certain phase modulation (PM) downlinks, the uplink to downlink frequency ratio was exactly 221/240. The ALSEP lunar surface experiments shared a common uplink and did not,insofar as is known, implement a coherent transponder. (The passive laser retroreflectors left by the Apollo 11, 14 and 15 missions provide much greater accuracy, and have far outlived the active electronics in the other ALSEP experiments.) The Lunar Communications <b>Relay</b> <b>Unit</b> (LCRU) on the Lunar Rover had its own downlink frequency (to avoid interference with the LM) but shared the LM's uplink frequency as it did not implement a coherent transponder. To keep the VHF transmitters on the LM and LCRU from both trying to relay uplink voice and interfering with each other, separate voice subcarriers were used on the common S-band uplink: 30 kHz for the LM and 124 kHz for the LCRU.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT-At {{any place}} on the planet, there is a normal {{temperature}} of + 30 ◦C per km dug into the earth. Therefore, if one digs 20, 000 feet the temperature will be about 190 ◦C above the surface temperature. This difference {{will be enough to}} produce electricity. However, no useful and economical technology has been developed to extracted this large source of energy. In this paper we are proposing a new economical method to harness this energy using PLC. Direct sources function by sending water down a well to be heated by the Earth’s warmth. Then a heat pump is used to take the heat from the underground water to the substance that heats the house. Then after the water it is cooled is injected back into the Earth using PLC & SCADA.

40|$|Abstract:- In the {{conventional}} three – zone stepped directional distance scheme, distance relay {{is used to}} provide the primary as well as remote backup protection. However, the mal-operation of this relay under stressed conditions such as power swing and switching action transient instability may affect {{the reliability of the}} whole protective scheme. The voltage and current phasors needed by the distance relay for determining the impedance may be measured with integrated Phasor Measurement Unit. However, this measurement accuracy may be affected by several power disturbances such as fast and slow dc offsets decaying due to sudden current changes, inter-harmonics, etc. To avoid these effects for improving the quality of measurements and hence the distance relay reliability, this work proposes a new real-time filtering method for removing the unwanted DC offset and hence improving SDFT algorithm. To validate the present method, the performance of developed distance relay is tested using the data generated by Simulink/MATLAB simulator. The obtained simulation results are satisfactory.

To permit greater scientific yield from manned lunar exploration, {{it was necessary to}} provide improvements in crew mobility plus communications compatible with extended extravehicular activity. Expansion of EVA and video communications capability was constrained by the requirement of interfacing with existing earth and lunar surface facilities, vehicle payload requirements, and crew operational considerations. Various trade-off s were conducted to permit rapid development of a feasible communication's system which are described herein.

40|$|This report {{contains}} a study for implementing an eight phase directional cylindrical antenna for the tactical communication system ERITAC. The report describes ideas for implementing {{control of the}} directional cylindrical antenna. It describes problematic issues and gives solutions to them. The report describes a tested prototype solution. It describes that changes made on the ECCM unit and the PRO unit are all made in software. It describes a possible design solution of a new unit to control the antenna switch. This unit is called the antenna switch control unit and is supplied and controlled from the Radio <b>relay</b> <b>unit.</b> The system is designed to function in the master station in Point to multipoint communication.

40|$|Appropriate {{soil water}} level is a {{necessary}} pre-requisite for optimum plant growth. Also, water being an essential element for life sustenance, there is the necessity to avoid its undue usage. Irrigation is a dominant consumer of water. This calls for the need to regulate water supply for irrigation purposes. Fields should neither be over-irrigated nor under-irrigated. Over time, systems have been implemented towards realizing this objective of which automated processes {{are the most popular}} as they allow information to be collected at high frequency with less labor requirements. Bulk of the existing systems employ micro-processor based systems. These systems offer several technological advantages but are unaffordable, bulky, difficult to maintain and less accepted by the technologically unskilled workers in the rural scenario. The objective of this project is to design a simple, easy to install methodology to monitor and indicate the level of soil moisture that is continuously controlled in order to achieve maximum plant growth and simultaneously optimize the available irrigation resources. A simple opamp based comparator circuit is used coupled with <b>relay</b> <b>units</b> which control the water pumps. The use of easily available components reduces the manufacturing and maintenance costs. This makes the proposed system to be an economical, appropriate and a low maintenance solution for applications, especially in rural areas and for small scale agriculturists. ...|$|R
