Kennelly {{undertook}} {{an experiment}} measuring {{the change in}} impedance of telephone receivers over a range of audio frequencies when the diaphragm was clamped by finger or quill insert. At each frequency the <b>receiver</b> <b>resistance</b> and reactance were measured and impedance computed, then the difference of free versus clamped impedance plotted as a complex number, or point in the impedance plane. For every receiver, the range of frequencies yields a series of con-cyclic points. The phenomenon was called [...] "motional impedance" [...] and the circle a [...] "motional impedance circle". This example of circular phenomena in device-impedance became so familiar, eventually, that the Smith Chart was introduced to provide a bounded universe (or chart) for such circles.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Interference {{from other}} {{adjacent}} users in wireless applications {{is a major}} problem in direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA). This is also known as the near-far problem where a strong signal from one user interferes with other users. The current approach to deal with the near-far problem in DS-CDMA systems is to use strict transmitter power control. An alternative approach is to use near-far resistant receivers. The practical near-far <b>resistance</b> <b>receiver</b> structure is the adaptive decorrelating detectors since it avoids complex matrix inversion. The existing CDMA standard known as IS- 95 uses a long signature code sequence. However for simplicity, the adaptive multi-user receiver uses short signature code sequence. The problem is that adaptive <b>receivers</b> lose near-far <b>resistance</b> as the number of users increases in the system. This thesis describes a novel method of multistage decision feedback cancellation (DFC) scheme immune from the near-far problem. The performance of the new DFC structure is constructed using three different adaptive algorithms: the least mean squared (LMS), the recursive least squared (RLS) and the linearly constraint constant modulus (LCCM) adaptive algorithms. It is found that LMS adaptive algorithm provides the best result considering its simple hardware complexity. It is also found that the LMS adaptive receiver along with the DFC structure provides a better bit synchronization capability to the over all system. Since the receiver is near-far resistant, the LMS adaptive receiver along with the decision feedback cancellation structure also performs better in the presence of Rayleigh fading...|$|R
30|$|Zero-knowledge {{watermark}} detectors {{presented to}} date {{are based on}} a linear correlation between the asset features and a given secret sequence. This detection function is susceptible of being attacked by sensitivity attacks, for which zero-knowledge does not provide protection. In this paper, an efficient zero-knowledge version of the generalized Gaussian maximum likelihood (ML) detector is introduced. This detector has shown an improved resilience against sensitivity attacks, that is empirically corroborated in the present work. Two versions of the zero-knowledge detector are presented; the first one makes use of two new zero-knowledge proofs for absolute value and square root calculation; the second is an improved version applicable when the spreading sequence is binary, and it has minimum communication complexity. Completeness, soundness, and zero-knowledge properties of the developed protocols are proved, and they are compared with previous zero-knowledge watermark detection protocols in terms of <b>receiver</b> operating characteristic, <b>resistance</b> to sensitivity attacks, and communication complexity.|$|R
40|$|Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) {{has been}} long {{proven to be}} a {{successful}} modulation format in wireless communication [1]. Although the concept of applying MSK in optical transmission systems was studied as early as the 1990 s, it has recently aroused a renewed interest in the research community owing to its unique characteristics such as compact spectrum, continuous phase and also its less comparative complexity in achievement compared to other advanced modulation formats. In this thesis the author built an MSK transmission simulation platform using programming software in the name of SIMULINK™ and VPItransmissionMaker™ and investigated the gaps in current MSK research over the past few years. The contributions are: • A range of various MSK transmitters and receivers proposed by different researchers were systematically summarized and evaluated. • A novel MSK modulation format DC 33 MSK is proposed. • The resistance of various MSK formats in the presence of imperfections of transmitters and receivers were analysed. • The performance of novel MSK formats in long haul transmission including residual dispersion, dispersion mapping and effects of nonlinear noise were analysed. It was found that the novel DC 33 MSK format is not only less complex to generate than the conventional linear MSK signal, but also has many advantages over linear MSK signals in terms of <b>receiver</b> sensitivity, <b>resistance</b> to transmitter and receiver noises and residual dispersion. The findings in this thesis show that DC 33 MSK is a good candidate for future optical transmission systems being a good compromise between spectral efficiency, robustness and complexity...|$|R

This detection function is susceptible of being attacked by sensitivity attacks, for which zero-knowledge does not provide protection. In this paper, an efficient zero-knowledge version of the Generalized Gaussian Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector is introduced. The inherent robustness that this detector presents against sensitivity attacks, together with the security provided by the zero-knowledge protocol that conceals the keys {{that could be used to}} remove the watermark or to produce forged assets, results in a robust and secure protocol. Two versions of the zero-knowledge detector are presented; the first one makes use of two new zero-knowledge proofs for modulus and square root calculation; the second is an improved version applicable when the spreading sequence is binary, and it has minimum communication complexity.

40|$|A {{heat pipe}} {{designed}} for operation as {{a solar power}} receiver should be optimized to accept the solar energy flux and transfer this heat into a reactor. Optical properties of the surface, thermal conductance of the <b>receiver</b> wall, contact <b>resistance</b> of the heat pipe wick, and other heat pipe wick properties ultimately define {{the maximum amount of}} power that can be extracted from the concentrated sunlight impinging on the evaporator surface. Modeling of solar power receivers utilizing optical and physical properties provides guidance to their design. On-sun testing is another important means of gathering information on performance. A test rig is being designed and built to conduct on-sun testing. The test rig is incorporating a composite strip mirror concentrator developed as part of a Small Business Innovative Research effort and delivered to NASA Glenn Research Center. In the strip concentrator numerous, lightweight composite parabolic strips of simple curvature were combined to form an array 1. 5 m x 1. 5 m in size. The line focus of each strip is superimposed in a central area simulating a point of focus. A test stand is currently being developed to hold the parabolic strip concentrator, track the sun, and turn the beam downward towards the ground. The hardware is intended to be sufficiently versatile to accommodate on-sun testing of several receiver concepts, including those incorporating heat pipe evaporators. Characterization devices are also being developed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the solar concentrator, including a receiver designed to conduct calorimetry. This paper describes the design and the characterization devices of the on-sun test rig, and the prospect of coupling the concentrated sunlight to a heat pipe solar power receiver developed as part of another Small Business Innovative Research effort...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{interact}} with numerous organisms in their communities, including neighboring plants. In large part, these interactions are mediated by blends of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) that plants emit into their headspaces, which may inform other organisms by reflecting plants' physiologies and the biotic and abiotic stresses they are experiencing. However, while the ubiquity of VOC-mediated plant-plant interactions is well established, their mechanisms, ecological outcomes and evolutionary trajectories remain largely uncharacterized. Collectively, these experiments seek to close some of these knowledge gaps, using tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima) and its diverse herbivore community as a model system. Chapter 1 reviews the literature on plants' responses to herbivores and VOCs from neighboring plants - highlighting numerous parallels between the molecular mechanisms and ecological outcomes underlying induced responses to herbivores and VOC-mediated plant-plant interactions. We emphasize the need to conduct mechanistic and ecological studies that directly compare plants' responses to VOCs vis-à-vis herbivory. Chapter 2 examines the effects of VOC-mediated plant-plant interactions on herbivore performance and behavior. It reveals that these interactions may result in VOC-exposed and herbivore-damaged plants becoming of equally bad food quality for subsequent herbivores - reducing feeding and increasing between-host movement - {{in spite of the}} fact that induced leaf chemistry of damaged and exposed plants is not identical. Chapter 3 explores whether VOC-mediated plant-plant interactions have specific effects on different herbivores. We demonstrate that herbivore-induced VOCs elicit specific chemical changes in exposed plants, and that these chemical changes have specific effects - making VOC-exposed plants more or less resistant to subsequent herbivores. Chapter 4 explores whether VOC emission and perception vary across plant genotypes. We find that genotypes vary in their abilities to emit and perceive VOCs, and that <b>receivers</b> may induce <b>resistance</b> or susceptibility to subsequent herbivores, or not respond, depending on the genotypes of VOC-emitting plants. Collectively, these experiments reveal that the identity of a plant's neighbors affects available information and its resistance state in its community. The observed specificity and genotypic variation in VOC-mediated plant-plant interactions suggests that it is worth exploring the costs and benefits of these interactions in the context of the genetic structure of plant populations, and the diversity/composition of the herbivore community. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|R
