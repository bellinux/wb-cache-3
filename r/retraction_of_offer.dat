40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} amount of {{anchorage}} loss of the maxillary posterior teeth and amount <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the maxillary anterior teeth between en masse retraction and two-step <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the anterior teeth. Materials and Methods: The sample consisted of 30 female adult patients with Class I maloc-clusion and lip protrusion who needed maximum posterior anchorage. The sample was subdivided into group 1 (n 15, mean age 21. 4 years, en masse retraction) and group 2 (n 15, mean age 24. 6 years, two-step retraction). Lateral cephalograms were taken before (T 1) and after treatment (T 2). Nine skeletal and 10 anchorage variables were measured, and independent t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Although the amount <b>of</b> horizontal <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the maxillary anterior teeth was not different between the two groups, there was mild labial movement of the root apices of the upper incisors in group 2 at T 2. There {{were no significant differences}} in the degree of anchorage loss of the maxillary posterior teeth between the two groups. Bodily and mesial movements of the upper molars occurred in both groups. Approximately 4 mm <b>of</b> the <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the upper incisal edges resulted from 1 mm of anchorage loss in the upper molars in both groups. Conclusion: No significant differences existed in the degree of anchorage loss of the upper posterior teeth and the amount <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the upper anterior teeth associated with en masse retraction and two-step <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the anterior teeth.

Nodules flow rearward on thin, actin-rich fibers (retraction fibers) exposed as the cell margin retracts. <b>Retraction</b> <b>of</b> the cell margin and rearward flow of nodules require intact actin filaments, but are insensitive to an inhibitor of myosin function (butanedione monoxime). Using photoactivation of fluorescence marking, we have determined that actin filaments in the majority <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> fibers remain stationary while the cell margin retracts and nodules flow rearward. The pointed ends <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> fiber actin filaments face the cell center. We argue that nodule motility is driven by a novel actin-based force that perhaps also partially contributes to <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the cell margin during cell rounding at mitosis...|$|R
