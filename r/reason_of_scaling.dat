Bakun Dam and its affiliated infrastructure could be the single largest and most expensive energy project ever undertaken in Southeast Asia. Based on data collected through site visits, original field research in Sarawak, and more than 80 research interviews, the article begins by teasing out the complex history and drivers behind the Bakun project before identifying a set of potential social, political, and economic benefits the project could deliver.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} how {{the relationship}} between elected representatives, policy frameworks and evolving policy processes impacts upon local electronic government (e-government) {{and the provision of}} online contexts for civic participation. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as the Internet and World Wide Web are embedded in many citizens’ everyday lives. Governments, however, have been slow to respond to technological changes that enable increased interaction and advanced two-way communication with citizens. The case study presented is the Victorian municipality of the City of Casey in Melbourne’s south-east, with a population of over 259, 000. Like many Australian local governments, Casey utilises the Internet to offer increased information dissemination through its website (www. casey. vic. gov. au), but offers limited opportunities for policy discussion that might facilitate citizen involvement in decision-making. Casey is, nonetheless, well situated to trial and implement online participatory practices – for <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale,</b> infrastructure, financial resources, and civic access to ICTs. Implementing a ‘grounded’ methodological approach, the thesis undertakes a document analysis of Casey’s policies and strategies, and semi-structured interviews with Casey Councillors in order to examine the council’s impact on {{the development and implementation of}} online mechanisms for civic participation. The research concludes that a combination of insufficient policy documentation and the contentious motives and actions of policy actors are restricting e-government development. Advancing e-government demands a more integrated approach that combines federal guidance with local knowledge. Additionally, increased awareness is needed amongst Casey’s policy-makers about ICTs, the value of civic involvement, and the potential benefits and risks associated with online civic participation. These findings arise out of changing communicative and democratic practices and need to be recognised and addressed by governments if online initiatives are to enable civic engagement. Ultimately, e-government must be understood and approached as both a technological and political matter...|$|R

Specifically, we tested {{the relevance of the}} combination of lower transportation cost with the role <b>of</b> economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> in explaining the regional distribution of total activity and of industrial activity. Economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> are assumed to be due to "backward and forward" linkages among firms. We also took into account congestion effects and asymmetry among regions. The model was tested for the regions of Brazil, in the period 1950 - 1995 and 1970 - 1995, and for the regions of India, in the period 1961 - 1991. Using panel results, we observed that transportation costs were generating concentration of total activity in the periods 1950 - 1995 arid 1950 - 1970. For these samples, there is evidence that economies <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> were a cause of concentration of total activity. Other forces, not explained by the model, were generating dispersion and so were congestion effects. For the period 1970 - 1995, we found that congestion effects and lower transportation cost were helping to disperse economic activity, in the panel results. Economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> were not, contrary to the model's predictions, helping economic growth. In the case of Brazil, for the 18 -state samples, industrial activity tended to concentrated due to the effects of lower transportation cost, although higher industrial growth rates were a characteristic of the states with less economies <b>of</b> <b>scales.</b> In the case of India, strong concentration effects were taking place, both due to lower transportation cost and due to other <b>reasons.</b> Economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> were not important in the explanation of the path of India activity...|$|R

The sum of the irreversible Li losses (difference between the lithiation and delithiation capacities) during the first four cycles amounts to 1, 606 mAh/g for the short wires and 3, 087 mAh/g for the long wires (1.92 times the value for short wires). The SEI forms mainly during these first cycles, being the losses minimal afterwards. Considering the active portion of the wires with lengths 70 and 130  μm, the scaling factor is 2, value very close to the value 1.92 of the proportion of SEI. Thus, one may say that the SEI scales with the length, but tests with other wire lengths are necessary to confirm the theory. For the moment, the <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> this <b>scaling</b> is not clear. The SEI is an important structural component of the anode, which may be a decisive factor for the mechanical stability of the anode. Nevertheless, the amount of Li necessary to form it has to be carefully considered when scaling up the length of the wires; one needs an excess of Li of the order as the scaling factor.|$|R

It is concerning the property rights, the use rights, and the contract rights of the farmland as the system that has the decisive influence upon small scale management in Chinese agriculture. The farmland was seized from the landowner during the land reform around 1950 and was evenly distributed to the farmer.

In the people 2 ̆ 7 s commune the property rights and the use rights were belong to the same group, and agriculture management was extremely inefficient. So the household contract system came forth. The use rights were evenly distributed to the farmers though the group ownership of the farmland was maintained, and later was converted to family management. This is a prototype of a present agricultural management system. This basic stance of evenly distributing the farmland to the farmers remained unchanged about 30 years. The promotion of a farmland transfer and large-scale management has been encouraged to adjust the farmland supply and demand among farmers and to improve the agricultural output.

40|$|Sam Neill and Judy Rymer {{in their}} {{documentary}} Cinema of Unease (1995) vocalised what many have thought, {{which is that}} New Zealand film has a dark side to it. The film's subtitle is a "personal journey" taken by Sam Neill therefore it is obviously {{his point of view}} that is put across in the film's narration. In the documentary Neil and Rymer examine the images that they believe make up the "uniquely strange and dark" atmosphere of New Zealand films. Sam Neill states that there are varied feelings making up the dark tone; these are alienation, abandonment, horror, madness, fear and violence. He believes that what essentially encouraged the prevalence of these feelings in our cinematic texts was a growing distance between the colony and the "Motherland" and the gradual focus of New Zealand film on the less "sunny" side of American film that was produced in the fifties and consumed here. The way of depicting these images, he believes, was achieved in the dark and menacing (and sometimes isolated) natural landscape of New Zealand. I am, in this thesis, suggesting a different explanation from Sam Neill and Judy Rymer's account for this "uniquely strange and dark atmosphere". In fact I think it is not unique but has much in common with an older tradition and style, namely Gothic. I will be calling "Gothic" a style or form in this study because I believe that it has qualities that enable it to be adapted to different generic types. My discussion in Chapter Three is an example as elements of the Gothic style have been adapted to film noir and the paranoid woman's film. My suggestion that there is a significantly Gothic character to New Zealand film expands the range of this present study of national film because the amount of information and theory on Gothic is immense. The fluidity of the style has allowed it to cross over into many different genres of literature and film which again extends the range of possible parallels with New Zealand film. For practical <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale,</b> I have chosen just three aspects of the Gothic that I believe New Zealand film exemplifies. I shall begin with traditional Gothic literature and its themes and devices as a possible influence on New Zealand film. I shall then go on to look at other areas where the Gothic style is operating: New Zealand literature and its commonalities with the national cinema, and finally examine Hollywood film and explain some of it's parallels with our comparatively small industry...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The goal is the {{analysis}} of the conflict growing between the interest of the inhabitants and that of the real estate market. With particular reference to Italy, considering the trends of residential urban transformations it is necessary to understand if the welfare of the inhabitants has improved. To inhabit {{it is one of the}} four pillars of the Athens Charter (1938), considering as base brick the family structure formed mostly by two adults, one worker (mainly male) and two children. With the life that was rhythmed by the times of production (Ernesti, 1995) i. e. the movements ?house?work?. So for over 300 years the home issue has had a close relationship with that work as the many models of economy of space have proved. And the third/fourth age was not contemplated, instead today it represents the larger population. In manufacture, in administrative offices etc. the jobs have become unsteady and the precarious ones, both temporally and geographically, have risen in Western countries: the uncontrolled globalization requires the labour force free from any ties, as are the other its products/elements. To underline that in countries called BRIC the model ?home-work? is still valid for <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> and agglomeration: the causes of their growing ?urban gigantism?. The paper investigates, using case studies, if there is awareness of these radical social transformations, how they are tackled and what idea of civitas is proposed and is built with the cum-cives - i. e the citizens. All this with the EU budget constraints that limit local authorities in their urban policies and therefore also those for the house. Thus forcing them to disposals of public property, also the residential one, to heal the financial deficit, as it is happening recently in the capital of Italy. Conclusion The housing policies must be essential part of urban policy, related to those social and fiscal ones. If, as is the Italian case, there are reforms of the cadastre that raise property values, without urban policies of social equity there isn?t ?social housing? that can work. Unless the logical is to pursue the US model of ?social and wealth zoning?, elder people in ?city of pensioners' or abandoned, increasing the ghettoization and peripheries without quality and having gentrification of inner cities. Without National Policies, much more than the bad recent Italian ?House Plan? the ?home question? will remain open. It is possible to have by useful examples suggestions for methodological good practices and strategies that make clear the need for such an integrated approach. The only way for getting more equity spatially and the reduction of the risk of social unrest. An approach able to conjugate the market and policy, that is the art of govern the polis...|$|R

The problem is urgent given that courts are now regularly sentencing corporate offenders, sometimes (but sometimes not) to extremely punitive terms of imprisonment. Policing of fraud by multiple jurisdictions in a federal system means that principled sentencing law is necessary not only for first-order policy reasons but also for coordination of sanctioning efforts. Proportionality and rationality demand that sentencing law have an agreed scale for measuring cases of financial reporting fraud in relation to each other, a sound methodology for fixing a given case on that scale, and a <b>reasoned</b> calibration <b>of</b> that <b>scale.</b> Current federal law, which controls most such cases and is {{a focal point for}} non-federal cases and public debate, is close to sensible on the first score but far off the mark on the other two. In this contribution to a symposium on 2 ̆ 2 Fraud and Federalism, 2 ̆ 2 I describe problems in present law and offer relatively uncontroversial reform measures that could substantially improve the law governing sentencing of financial reporting fraud...|$|R

In this context totally 135 theses as 117 master and 18 doctorate in the National Theses Center (YÖKTEZ) were examined. Above mentioned theses were subjected to descriptive analysis through the scale used, the original language <b>of</b> the <b>scale,</b> the adaptation <b>of</b> the <b>scale</b> to Turkish, the <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> usage, validity and reliability analysis. According to the findings of the study; it was realized that instead <b>of</b> developing new <b>scales</b> existing scales that translated to Turkish were used commonly, the use <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> were not <b>reasoned</b> and validity analysis were not performed sufficiently. The results indicate that the methodical problems and “ceremonial empiricism” tendency are continuing in graduate theses...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing number}} of agents from {{internet}} entrepreneurs to celebrities are entering an increasingly crowded development space, bringing with them ideas and approaches that emphasise market-oriented modes of grant-making. The discourse and practices of the new philanthropy, as {{it has come to}} be known, as well as the organisational forms which underpin programmatic design, is increasingly informed by a particular form of managerialism, labelled philanthrocapitalism by Bishop and Green (2008). This is hailed as a harbinger of dynamism to the supposedly staid and partly ineffectual third sector, which, its critics attest, has failed in its mission to curb entrenched poverty. For reasons that are not always clear, however, examination of these actors – new foundations, venture philanthropists etc – has largely flown under the radar of international political economy and development studies scholars who have tended, perhaps for <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> sectoral <b>scale</b> or an 'enemy perception' as Knorringa and Helmsing (2008) have described it, to ignore the growth of social entrepreneurship in favour of empirical analysis of NGOs and programmes of official development actors such as international organisations and bilateral agencies. This paper investigates sectoral 'blending' in international development, a process whereby private sector approaches are diffused by 'for-profit' social enterprises such as Google. org, the Acumen Fund and the Skoll Foundation with the aim of increasing performance and 'impact'. It explores what this nascent paradigm might mean for the trajectory of development cooperation. It is found that a not-so-quiet revolution is taking place in philanthropy in the US. Despite the hollow platitudes that sometimes accompany this phenomenon, it is argued that it has significant implications for development policy and practice by both challenging and, somewhat counter intuitively, complementing the participatory model that has dominated development discourses since the late 1980 s...|$|R
40|$|From the Introduction]. The 1980 s {{have brought}} a {{striking}} change {{in the design of}} European industrial research policies. In the "technology gap" 1960 s the policy response to the American challenge was to emulate the apparent <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> American success: large firms which could take advantage of multinational markets and economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> in research and manufacturing. Parochial distributional conflict and market concentration in government owned and trade-protected national flagship companies [...] the national champions, like Siemens in Germany, and Thornson in France [...] defined the European commercial high technology sector. The intra-European cooperative policies which did emerge, like Euratom, Airbus, and the two European space organizations were also based on obvious needs for sufficient economies <b>of</b> <b>scale.</b> Even then, the cooperation proceeded by fits and starts...|$|R
