5|$|In July 1897, {{the first}} {{news of the}} Klondike gold strike reached Seattle, Washington, {{triggering}} the Klondike Gold Rush. Thousands of people boarded steamships heading north to the gold fields. Some of these travelers sailed around the western tip of Alaska and up the Yukon River to Dawson City (site of the gold fields) <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>take</b> an arduous overland trip across the Boundary Ranges.|$|E
5|$|After the election, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>take</b> a {{job with}} Roosevelt's {{administration}} in Albany, Howe remained in New York City to prepare for Roosevelt's 1932 presidential run. During this period, he worked closely with James Farley, chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee and another devoted Roosevelt supporter. Roosevelt would later publicly credit the pair with being {{the two men who}} had done the most to secure his election.|$|E
5|$|Frank Pick {{was born}} on 23 November 1878 at Spalding, Lincolnshire. He was the first child of five born to draper Francis Pick and his wife Fanny Pick (née Clarke). Pick's {{paternal}} grandfather, Charles Pick, was a farmer in Spalding who died in his forties, leaving eight children. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Clarke, was a blacksmith and Wesleyan lay preacher. As a child, Pick was bookish, preferring to read and build collections of moths and butterflies and objects found on the beach <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>take</b> part in sports.|$|E

5|$|In January 1861, Missouri {{called a}} {{convention}} {{to determine whether}} it would follow the lead of other pro-slavery states and secede from the Union. Knott was sympathetic to the southern cause, but opposed the methods of the secessionists. The Unionist position carried the convention by an 80,000-vote majority. Knott resigned his position as attorney general <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>take</b> an oath of allegiance required by the federal government. As a result of his refusal, he was disbarred from practice in the state of Missouri and imprisoned for a short time.|$|E
5|$|While {{construction}} of the spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments would be housed proceeded somewhat more smoothly than the {{construction of}} the OTA, Lockheed still experienced some budget and schedule slippage, and by the summer of 1985, {{construction of the}} spacecraft was 30% over budget and three months behind schedule. An MSFC report said that Lockheed tended to rely on NASA directions <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>take</b> their own initiative in the construction.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{established}} a shipyard on the Sheepscot River at Merrymeeting Bay in Maine in 1675 at {{the outbreak of}} King Philips War. The shipyard was successful, turning {{out a number of}} small boats and building its first large merchant ship in 1676. As he was preparing for its maiden voyage in August 1676, planning to deliver a load of lumber to Boston, a band of Indians descended on the area during the Northeast Coast Campaign (1676). <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>take</b> on his cargo, he took on board as many of the local settlers as he could. Although he was financially ruined (the Indians destroyed the shipyard and his intended cargo of masts and lumber), Phips was considered a hero among the colonists in Boston.|$|E

5|$|The Barra estates of MacNeil (including all the Barra Isles) {{were sold}} to Colonel John Gordon of Cluny Aberdeenshire in 1840 whose lack of {{consideration}} for his tenants during the potato famines was matched by his zeal for evictions to create sheep farms. However, the Highland Clearances {{seemed to have the}} effect of increasing Mingulay’s population as families evicted from Barra sometimes chose to re-settle there <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>take</b> the emigrant ships to Nova Scotia. In this regard Mingulay's remoteness was probably an advantage and rents were actually reduced from 1840–45. In 1878 Lady Gordon Cathcart inherited the estate and visited but once during her fifty-four year period of tenure.|$|E
5|$|Bedser was {{relieved}} after 70 minutes of bowling. The leg spin of Wright was introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a no ball that Morris dispatched into the leg side crowd for six, before hitting another ball for four. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. Coxon continued to significantly rough up the pitch outside the right-handed batsman's leg stump, {{and from the}} other, Wright was able to extract substantial spin on the first morning of the match, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump. At lunch, Australia were 82/1 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. The tourists had largely been content to wait for loose deliveries, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>take</b> risks, and as the Englishmen bowled accurately, the Australians did not score quickly.|$|E
5|$|Command, control, and {{coordination}} {{of the operation}} {{was going to be}} problematic, especially in the highly politicized South Vietnamese command structure, where the support of key political figures was of paramount importance in promotion to and retention of command positions. Lieutenant General Lê Nguyên Khang, the Vietnamese Marine Corps commander and protege of Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, whose troops were scheduled to participate in the operation, actually outranked General Lãm, who had the support of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. The same situation applied to Lieutenant General Dư Quốc Đống, commander of ARVN Airborne forces also scheduled to participate in the operation. After the incursion began, both men remained in Saigon and delegated their command authority to junior officers <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>take</b> orders from Lãm. This did not bode well for the success of the operation.|$|E

5|$|The game {{opens with}} Zidane and the Tantalus Theater Troupe {{attempting}} to kidnap Princess Garnet during her sixteenth birthday celebration {{in the city}} of Alexandria. Upon reaching her, they discover that Garnet, who is concerned about Queen Brahne's increasingly erratic behavior, had planned on escaping the city and is willing to be kidnapped, especially as their employer, Regent Cid of Lindblum, is who she wanted to run to. During the escape from the city, the troupe is joined by Vivi, who is looking to explore, and Steiner, who decides to travel with Garnet for her protection <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>take</b> her back against her will. After the group flees the city and its guards, their damaged airship crashes, and Zidane, Garnet, Vivi, and Steiner travel on together. During their journey to Lindblum, Garnet takes the alias Dagger, and the group discovers a factory in the village of Dali that is manufacturing soulless black mage soldiers that look similar to Vivi.|$|E
5|$|This Act made null {{and void}} (with certain {{specific}} exceptions) the Marian act of 1554 that had repealed all Henry VIII's legislation from 1529 onwards, which had denied {{the authority of the}} See of Rome and also confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Supreme Governor was a suitably equivocal title that made Elizabeth head of the Church without ever saying she was. This was important for two reasons: (1) it satisfied those who felt that a woman could not rule the church, and (2) it acted in a conciliatory way toward English Roman Catholics. For the clergy, Elizabeth's changes were more wholesale than those of her half-brother, Edward, had been. All but one (Anthony Kitchin) of the bishops lost their posts, a hundred fellows of Oxford colleges were deprived; many dignitaries resigned <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>take</b> the oath. The bishops who were removed from the ecclesiastical bench were replaced by appointees who would agree to the reforms.|$|E

50|$|I Capuleti e i Montecchi (The Capulets and the Montagues) is an Italian opera (Tragedia lirica) in two acts by Vincenzo Bellini. The {{libretto}} by Felice Romani was a reworking of {{the story}} of Romeo and Juliet for an opera by Nicola Vaccai called Giulietta e Romeo and based on the play of the same name by Luigi Scevola written in 1818, thus an Italian source <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>taken</b> directly from William Shakespeare.|$|R
50|$|The {{fluctuation}} theory {{establishes a}} clear {{link between the}} strength of the stellar wind and the basic properties of the star, which, as mentioned above, the mechanisms by themselves cannot establish. Metatheories are not very common in astrophysics. Also fluctuations are usually ignored <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>taken</b> as a starting point. When the fluctuation theory, which Andriesse still sees as his best work, did not gain much acceptance, Andriesse left astrophysics in disappointment in 1980.|$|R
