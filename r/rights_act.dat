5|$|Section 3 of the Human <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> 1998 is a {{provision}} of the Human <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> 1998 that enables the Act to take effect in the United Kingdom. The section requires courts to interpret both primary and subordinate legislation so that their provisions are compatible with the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights, which {{are also part of}} the Human <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> 1998. This interpretation goes far beyond normal statutory interpretation, and includes past and future legislation, therefore preventing the Human <b>Rights</b> <b>act</b> from being impliedly repealed by subsequent contradictory legislation.|$|E
5|$|As {{its first}} {{enforcement}} legislation, Congress passed the Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866, guaranteeing black Americans citizenship and {{equal protection of}} the law, though not the right to vote. The amendment was also used as authorizing several Freedmen's Bureau bills. President Andrew Johnson vetoed these bills, but Congress overrode his vetoes to pass the Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> and the Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill.|$|E

5|$|To {{defeat the}} Voting <b>Rights</b> <b>Act,</b> McCulloch {{introduced}} an alternative bill, H.R. 7896. It {{would have allowed}} the Attorney General to appoint federal registrars after receiving 25 serious complaints of discrimination about a jurisdiction, {{and it would have}} imposed a nationwide ban on literacy tests for persons who could prove they attained a sixth-grade education. McCulloch's bill was co-sponsored by House Minority Leader Gerald Ford (R-MI) and supported by Southern Democrats {{as an alternative to the}} Voting <b>Rights</b> <b>Act.</b> The Johnson administration viewed H.R. 7896 as a serious threat to passing the Voting <b>Rights</b> <b>Act.</b> However, support for H.R. 7896 dissipated after William M. Tuck (D-VA) publicly said he preferred H.R. 7896 because the Voting <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> would legitimately ensure that African Americans could vote. His statement alienated most supporters of H.R. 7896, and the bill failed on the House floor by a 171-248 vote on July 9. Later that night, the House passed the Voting <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> by a 333-85 vote (Democrats 221-61, Republicans 112-24).|$|E

5|$|The Citizenship Clause {{overruled}} the Supreme Court's Dred Scott {{decision that}} black people were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship. Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about {{the constitutionality of the}} Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866, or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. The Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866 had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil Rights Movement {{challenging}} the restrictions and discrimination practiced against blacks exercise of constitutional rights, a series of US Supreme Court cases, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the 24th Amendment, and federal legislation: the Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1964 and the Voting <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the provisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school segregation. Combined with the election of Governor Mills Godwin in 1965, there was impetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of the strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing, and used his power and popularity to push for a new constitution. In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission, chaired by former Governor Albertis Harrison, to revise the constitution.|$|E
