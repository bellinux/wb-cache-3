500|$|Looking {{to improve}} their team for a playoff run in 2000–01, the Blues dealt Conroy, along with a draft pick, to the Calgary Flames for Cory Stillman. The trade was {{initially}} unpopular in Calgary, as the Flames had given up their leading scorer for Conroy, who noted that {{that was when he}} [...] "learned not to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> or watch TV." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of June 29, 1971, Gravel {{attempted}} to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> {{on the floor of}} the Senate as part of his filibuster against the draft, but was thwarted when no quorum could be formed. Gravel instead convened a session of the Buildings and Grounds subcommittee that he chaired. He got New York Congressman John Dow to testify that the war had soaked up funding for public buildings, thus making discussion of the war relevant to the committee. He began reading from the papers with the press in attendance, omitting supporting documents that he felt might compromise national security, and declaring, [...] "It is my constitutional obligation to protect the security of the people by fostering the free flow of information absolutely essential to their democratic decision-making." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} days of street newspapers, people were often {{reluctant}} to buy from homeless vendors for fear that they were being scammed. Furthermore, many of the more activist papers fail to sell well because their writing and production are perceived to be unprofessional and lackluster. [...] Topics covered are sometimes seen as lacking newsworthy content, and of little relevance or interest to [...] the general public or the homeless community." [...] have traditionally been long on personal essays and short on hard news". [...] Organizations in Montreal and San Francisco have responded to these criticisms by offering workshops in writing and journalism for homeless contributors. Papers such as StreetWise have in the past been criticized as [...] "grim" [...] and for having vendors that are too loud and intrusive. Some newspapers sell well but may not be widely read, as many people will donate to vendors without buying, or buy the newspaper and then throw it away. Howley has described readers' hesitance or unwillingness to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> as [...] "compassion fatigue". On the other hand, those papers that do sell well and are widely read, such as The Big Issue, are often targets of criticism for being too [...] "mainstream" [...] or commercial.|$|E

In 1999, {{it was reported that}} Tom Mitchell, from Crowborough, Sussex, claimed to have shot Johnson's aircraft down when she twice failed to give the correct identification code during the flight. Mitchell explained how the aircraft was sighted and contacted by radio. A request was made for the signal. She gave the wrong one twice. [...] "Sixteen rounds of shells were fired and the plane dived into the Thames Estuary.

2500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began in}} 2002 when Max Niedermaier, {{a physicist at}} the University of Tours, emailed Ted Newman, a physicist at the University of Pittsburgh, alleging that the twins—who had previously had celebrity status for a science fiction television program in France—had spoofed their PhD theses. Rumors spread on Usenet newsgroups that the work was a deliberate hoax intended to target weaknesses in the peer review system employed by the physics community to select papers for publication in academic journals. The story spread like wildfire in public media, prompting Niedermaier to offer an apology to the Bogdanovs, admitting {{that he had not}} <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> firsthand. While the Bogdanov brothers continued to defend the veracity of their work, a Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) internal report was conducted in private. [...] The conclusions of their reports are confidential and only released to the parties involved. [...] Some physicists have also treated this as evidence of the fallibility inherent within the peer review system. The debate over whether the work represented a contribution to physics, or instead was meaningless, spread from Usenet to many other Internet forums, including the blogs of notable physicists. The ensuing dispute received considerable coverage in the mainstream media.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the last}} minute, {{late in the}} evening of 30 June, Lyell and Hooker {{forwarded}} the Wallace and Darwin papers to the Secretary John Joseph Bennett, to be read at the meeting the next day. Mrs. Hooker had spent the afternoon copying out extracts from the handwritten documents Darwin had sent with his letter of the previous night, presumably chosen by Hooker to suit the verbal presentation, and Lyell and Hooker wrote a short introductory letter. The papers entitled respectively On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, incorporated Wallace's pages; and extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray. At the meeting the Secretary <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> out, before going on to six other papers, and there was no discussion of them {{at the end of the}} meeting, perhaps because of the amount of business that had been dealt with including an obituary notice for Robert Brown given by Lyell, or possibly due to reluctance to speak out against a theory supported by the eminent Lyell and Hooker. Thomas Bell, who had written up the description of Darwin's reptile specimens from the Beagle expedition, presided over the meeting. He apparently disapproved, and in his annual presidential report presented in May 1859 wrote that [...] "The year which has passed has not, indeed, been marked by any of those striking discoveries which at once revolutionize, so to speak, the department of science on which they bear". However, the Vice-President promptly removed all references to immutability from his own paper which was awaiting publication.|$|E
