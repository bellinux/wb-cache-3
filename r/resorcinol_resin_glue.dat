After 1, 3, 5, and 10  years of exposure, block-shear test were conducted and deterioration of GLT according to position was investigated. Residual ratio of shear-strength increased in order of south-side, north-side, and middle of south-side and north-side positions. Deterioration rates of shear-strength at south-side were larger than those at north-side. Decrease and deterioration rate of shear-strength were large at upper glue-layers, and this was conspicuous in VAE with low adhesion durability. Wood-failure ratio decreased at the first glue-layer of VAE after 5  year of exposure. However, in other adhesive resins, differences of wood-failure ratio among position or glue-layers were small regardless of exposure duration.|$|R

The resin formulation which produced the best wood failure results was made with a glucose: urea: phenol: formaldehyde: resorcinol mole ratio of 1 : 0. 75 : 1 : 2. 0 : 1. 3.

Results for pair-comparison of AOCV between adhesive resins, showed significant differences in four pair-comparisons and those included VAE. Standard deviations of shear-strength tend to increase with exposure year, and for VAE they were larger than for the others. Results of goodness-of-fit tests of shear-strength for normal, log-normal, 2 P-Weibull, and 3 P-Weibull distributions, showed that none of these forms fit VAE after 1  year of exposure. Wood-failure ratio decreased gradually with exposure duration; however, even after 10  years of exposure, it was more than 80 % regardless of adhesive resin.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] In {{order to}} predict the service life of plywood heating floors, {{dry-heat}} exposure test of lauan plywood made with each of six type of typical wood adhesives was carried out at 50 °, 70 °, 100 ° and 150 °C for 250 days. Internal bond strength and location of failure of the exposed specimens were measured at selected intervals. Data were plotted {{as a function of}} the exposed time. Confidence limit was applied on the regression and the service life was calculated by extraporating the lower confidence limit curve to the half-strength. The apparent mechanism of dry-heat degradation of plywood in 1500 and 100 °C seemed to differ from the lower temperature exposures. On 70 ° and 50 °C, more conservative estimation was made by the kinetic method on the Arrhenius relationship. The result showed the detrimen-tal effect of the acid catalyst on polyvinyl-acetate cross-linked and urea resin adhesives. Plywood specimens produced with melamine, phenol, phenol-resorcinol, and <b>resorcinol</b> <b>resin</b> adhesives showed excellent durability in dry-heat exposure at temperature normally found in service of floor heating...|$|R

However, discerning between compounds from a same subgroup, for example diterpenoid resins, could be ambiguous because the spectra depend on the sample aspect, age and degradations...|$|R
50|$|Wooden planks can be scarfed into a strake by {{suitably}} tapering {{the thickness}} of the adjoining ends. Traditionally, the adjoining faces were coated with mixed white lead and grease, then held together with copper rivets. It was important to not have the plank end as thin as a feather edge and to have the outboard thin edge at the after end of the joint. In later times, after adhesives had been developed by the aircraft industry, the joint might be made with <b>resin</b> <b>glue</b> and no rivets. In heavier carvel work, the joint would be a butt, riveted to a butt strap. Even large clinker vessels had scarfed strakes as in this form of construction; the strakes contribute a significant proportion of the structural strength of the boat as well as keeping it water-tight.|$|R

A thick MDF panel at a density of 700-720 kg/m3 may be considered as high density in the case of softwood fibre panels, whereas a panel of the same density made of hard wood fibres is not regarded as so. The evolution of the various types of MDF has been driven by differing need for specific applications.|$|R
