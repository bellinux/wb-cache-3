With {{regards to the}} Principate, {{it was obvious to}} Augustus that Marcellus was not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> his position; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue to obey Agrippa.|$|E
5|$|Their {{high energy}} and drive make these dogs {{ideally suited to}} a number of {{different}} dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size, a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals. They may seem never to tire and will still be energetic after their owner has called it a day. While socialised members of the breed are friendly towards children, they will not tolerate abuse even if it is unintentional.|$|E
25|$|In 1863 and '64 rate wars erupted {{again when}} Irving's old rival, Moore {{returned}} from the Stikine River, rich with profits and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the new Reliance with his Flying Dutchman and Alexandra. Nevertheless, Irving managed to keep most of his customers and Moore claimed bankruptcy and his boats were taken from service.|$|E

The definitive test of strength came in 1950 during a nationwide general strike and mounting street clashes. On one day in March 1950, hundreds were wounded, including many policemen, and 7,000 people were arrested.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Razadarit took full {{advantage}} of Ava's preoccupation in the north. In 1387–88, Razadarit managed to capture the Martaban province after a long invasion. By 1389, Razadarit felt <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> Ava's ally Laukpya, and invaded the Irrawaddy delta. As in Martaban, Razadarit was close to defeat when {{he pulled out a}} victory. The Pegu forces went on to occupy the entire delta, including Ava's territory, Gu-Htut (modern Myan-Aung).|$|E
25|$|Darrow {{opened his}} first little law office in Andover, Ohio, a small farming town just ten miles from Kinsman. Having {{little to no}} experience, he started off slowly and {{gradually}} built up his career by dealing with the everyday complaints and problems of a farming community. After two years Darrow felt he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> new and different cases and moved his practice to Ashtabula, Ohio, which had a population of 5,000 people and was the largest city in the county. There he became involved in Democratic Party politics and served as the town counsel.|$|E

Hunt connects the tether to the train itself, forcing the helicopter into the Channel Tunnel after the train. Hunt places an explosive chewing gum on the helicopter windshield, killing Krieger and Phelps. Kittridge arrests Max and recovers the list, then reinstates Hunt and Stickell as IMF agents, but Hunt resigns. As he flies home, a flight attendant approaches him and asks, through a coded phrase, if he is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> a new mission, just as she asked Phelps at the beginning.|$|E
25|$|By {{the second}} half of the 19th century, Berlin had been growing at a {{tremendous}} rate for some time, but its growth accelerated even faster after the city became the capital of the new German Empire on 18 January 1871. Potsdamer Platz and neighbouring Leipziger Platz really started coming into their own from this time on. Now firmly in the centre of a metropolis whose population eventually reached 4.4 million, making it the third largest city in the world after London and New York, the area was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> its most celebrated role. Vast hotels and department stores, hundreds of smaller shops, theatres, dance-halls, cafés, restaurants, bars, beer palaces, wine-houses and clubs, all started to appear. Some of these places became internationally known.|$|E
25|$|With much {{of western}} {{mainland}} Southeast Asia under his control, Bayinnaung now felt <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> Siam. He needed an overwhelming advantage in manpower over Siam because unlike interior Shan states, Siam {{could not be}} overwhelmed by {{the strength of his}} Portuguese firearms alone. Siam was a prosperous coastal power in its own right, and its forces included Portuguese firearms, ships and mercenaries. On 16 July 1563, he sent an embassy to Siam, demanding one of the four white elephants in possession of the Siamese king as tribute. As expected, King Maha Chakkraphat duly refused. On 1 November 1563, five armies (60,000 men, 2400 horses and 360 elephants) left Pegu to start the campaign. Another army from Lan Na was supposed to come down but King Mekuti of Lan Na had revolted.|$|E

This was a stopgap measure until William, his oldest brother, was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him <b>on</b> as an apprentice surveyor. While in London, Alfred attended lectures and read books at the London Mechanics Institute. Here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the Welsh social reformer Robert Owen and of Thomas Paine.

Most strategic bombers of the two superpowers were designed to deliver nuclear weapons. For a time, some squadrons of Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers were kept in the air around the clock, orbiting some distance away from their fail-safe points near the Soviet border.|$|R
25|$|About 6,000 Confederate {{men were}} {{stationed}} {{around the rim}} of the harbor, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the 60 men in Fort Sumter. At 4:30a.m. on April 12, after two days of fruitless negotiations, and with Union ships just outside the harbor, the Confederates opened fire on orders from President Jefferson Davis. Edmund Ruffin had the honor firing the first shot. Thirty-four hours later, Anderson's men raised the white flag and were allowed to leave the fort with colors flying and drums beating, saluting the U.S. flag with a 50-gun salute before taking it down. During this salute, one of the guns exploded, killing a young soldier—the only casualty of the bombardment and the first casualty of the war. In a mass frenzy, North and South men rushed to enlist, as Lincoln called up troops to recapture the fort.|$|E
25|$|New Orleans {{agreed to}} {{commission}} the waterworks project in 1811, although Latrobe was not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the project immediately and faced financial problems in securing enough investors for the project. His {{work on the}} United States Capitol was completed shortly before the War of 1812 started, ending his source of steady income. During the war Latrobe unsuccessfully tried several wartime schemes to make money, including some steamboat projects. In 1814, Latrobe partnered with Robert Fulton in a steamship venture based at Pittsburgh. While in Pittsburgh, Latrobe designed and built a theater for the Circus of Pepin and Breschard. After the U. S. Capitol and White House were burned by the British Army, Latrobe remained in Washington to help with rebuilding, and Latrobe's son took on {{much of the work}} for the New Orleans waterworks project.|$|E
25|$|On Faro Island, a giant octopus {{attacks the}} native village. The mysterious Faro monster, {{revealed}} to be King Kong, arrives and defeats the octopus. Kong then drinks some red berry juice that immediately puts him to sleep. Sakurai and Kinsaburo place Kong on a large raft and begin to transport him back to Japan. Mr. Tako arrives on the ship transporting Kong, but a JSDF ship stops them and orders them to return Kong to Faro Island. Meanwhile, Godzilla arrives in Japan and begins terrorizing the countryside. Kong wakes up and breaks free from the raft. Reaching the mainland, Kong confronts Godzilla and proceeds to throw giant rocks at Godzilla. Godzilla is not fazed by King Kong's rock attack and uses its atomic breath to burn him. Kong retreats after realizing {{that he is not}} yet <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> Godzilla and its atomic breath.|$|E

This included the dropping of fellow opener Strauss from the one-day side, {{and the rise of}} Alastair Cook as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick stated that he would see how he progresses before committing to the international scene: [...] "Of course I'd love to play for England again.... Clearly, if I want to continue my career I have to undertake another tour. But for now, if and when I get back to full fitness and I think I am OK and ready to play, I'll make myself available for England."

He said that he would lobby the UK government to scrap the UK Trident programme if UK Labour leader Ed Miliband became prime minister in the next election and that he wanted to renationalise the railways in Scotland, bring an end to public-private partnerships, and commit the party to full employment. He supported introducing a 50 per cent tax band [...] "to tackle poverty and youth unemployment", but urged caution on tax devolvement to ensure Scotland did not end up [...] "worse off".

500|$|Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) is {{the bright}} and talented {{newcomer}} to Los Angeles, described as [...] "wholesome, optimistic, determined {{to take the}} town by storm", and [...] "absurdly naïve". Her perkiness and intrepid approach to helping Rita {{because it is the}} right thing to do is reminiscent of Nancy Drew for reviewers. Her entire persona at first is an apparent cliché of small-town naïveté. But it is Betty's identity, or loss of it, that appears to be the focus of the film. For one critic, Betty performed the role of the film's consciousness and unconscious. Naomi Watts, who modeled Betty on Doris Day, Tippi Hedren and Kim Novak, observed that Betty is a thrill-seeker, someone [...] "who finds herself in a world she doesn't belong in and is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> a new identity, even if it's somebody else's". This has also led one theorist to conclude that since Betty had naïvely, yet eagerly entered the Hollywood system, she had become a [...] "complicit actor" [...] who had [...] "embraced the very structure that" [...] destroyed her.

500|$|When the Archduke {{heard of}} Hotze's success in taking Winterthur crossroads, he {{directed}} his troops to augment Nauendorf's, {{and to take}} the village and the environs of Neftenbach, [...] west-northwest of Winterthur. Nicolas Oudinot, whose men had secured Neftenbach {{as part of the}} French forward line, held out for most of the day, but was forced to retreat [...] to Pfungen in the late afternoon; his position there was not defensible and he was pushed further back to the outskirts of Zürich. By taking Neftenbach, Charles placed a formidable group of troops between Ney's force and Hotze's flank and forced an uneven French withdrawal toward Zürich. Tharreau manoeuvred around the Töss, attempting to re-establish his forward line, but Masséna did not want a general engagement between Zürich and Neftenbach, not there and not then. The Armies of Switzerland and the Danube were not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> Charles; Masséna's forces were not prepared for a battle on the scale required in facing Charles' entire army, and he needed the defences offered by Zürich to mount a proper line against the impending Austrian attack. Eventually, Tharreau withdrew the entire forward line to Zürich. The clash took 11 hours.|$|E
