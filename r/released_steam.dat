Eight individuals were killed and six were injured. The broken connecting rod punctured the hull, and Lieutenant F.G.

50|$|These {{operate with}} a {{spring-loaded}} valve {{that is often}} hidden from view in a proprietary mechanism. This generation is characterized by two or more pressure settings. Some of these pressure cookers do not <b>release</b> any <b>steam</b> during operation (non-venting) and instead use a rising indicator with markings to show the pressure level. These only <b>release</b> <b>steam</b> when the pan is opened, or as a safety precaution if the heat source is not reduced enough when the pan reaches the required cooking pressure. Others use a dial that the operator can advance by a few clicks (which alters the spring tension) to change the pressure setting or release pressure; these <b>release</b> <b>steam</b> during operation (venting).|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of cherrywood (Prunus avium L.) colour changes during steaming treatment was conducted ex-perimentally. Time dependent colour transformation of cherry heart- and sapwood was assessed on clear wood specimens during an indirect steaming process running for 18 hours. The colour, chemical- and anatomical proper-ties were continually determined, by successive sampling at 3 -hour intervals. Wood colour was assessed {{with a standard}} 3 -stimulus colorimeter, using the CIE L*a*b * system. Chemical changes in wood specimens and <b>released</b> <b>steam</b> condensates were subsequently analysed with FT-IR spectrometry. Additionally, anatomic samples were ex-amined by light microscopy to evaluate changes in wood tissue anatomy. The results of colour measurements showed a decrease in lightness (L*) and in chromaticity on the blue-yellow axis (b*) in heartwood. Greater colour changes were observed in sapwood specimens, where {{a significant decrease in}} lightness (L*) and chromaticity on blue-yellow axis (b*) was present. On the other hand, increasing chromaticity was confirmed in sapwood on green-red axis (a*). The results of FT-IR spectroscopy showed a small decrease in cellulose in the heartwood, and a remarkable decrease in lignin and hemicelluloses, as it was expected. It seems that chemistry of sapwood was not influenced by duration of the steaming process. Chemical analyses of steam condensate compounds showed an increase in simpl...|$|E
40|$|Important {{challenges}} for fusion technology {{deal with the}} design of safety systems aimed to protect the Vacuum Vessel (VV) from pressurizing accidents like the Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA). To prevent or mitigate structural damages, the solution proposed is a safety system able to quickly condense <b>released</b> <b>steam</b> in cold water at sub-atmospheric conditions. This water suppression tank (VVPSS) is so aiming at limiting the maximum pressure in the VV to 0. 2. MPa during in-vessel coolant leak events and at maintaining the VV long-term pressure below atmospheric pressure during air or incondensable gases ingress, through the Direct Contact Condensation (DCC). The novelty of this study resides especially in the working condition of VVPSS, which operates precisely to sub-atmospheric pressure: up to date no explicit experimental data or investigation of DCC are in fact available in literature. To overcome this lack an extensive experimental {{work has been done}} at DICI - University of Pisa, where numerous condensation tests (more than 300) were performed. The operation condition investigated took into account downstream pressure between 30 and 117. kPa and water pool temperature from 30 up to 85. Â°C. The experimental measurements allow to study the influence of steam mass flux, water temperature and pool pressure on the steam condensation phenomenon (and in turn, based on the stable condensation regime, correctly analyze the design parameter of VVPSS). The results obtained are presented and discussed. Innovative condensation regime maps are in addition provided...|$|E

40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} {{a possibility for}} increasing the power output from diesel engines and improving the fuel economy for such engines. This is achieved by employing a power cycle which is driven solely by the engine waste-heat in the cooling water and, also, the exhaust gases. For road engines an organic fluid Rankine cycle is employed. R- 12 is evaporated in a boiler, fired by the coolant waste-heat. This is superheated using the exhaust-gases before it is introduced to a turbine where it expands down to an air-cooled condenser. The cycle power output can supplement the base engine power by about 16 % of its output. For stationary diesel engines, however, water is used in a steam Brayton power cycle. The <b>released</b> <b>steam,</b> from the cooling water in a flashing chamber, is compressed by a vapour compressor and superheated by the exhaust-gases. This steam is admitted to a turbine coupled to the compressor and {{the balance of the}} shaft power is the net output from the cycle. This amounts to about 15 Â· 3 % of the base engine output. The power cycles employed neither interfere with the operation of the base engine nor deny the application of a turbocharger to it. The thermodynamic analysis for the cycles is given, and the results show the potential for employing such cycles in order to improve the diesel engine's power output by up to 16 %. ...|$|E
40|$|In Tokamak-based fusion technology, a {{considered}} {{severe accident}} issue is inherent {{to a sudden}} overpressure inside the Vacuum Vessel (VV). Basically, {{this is due to}} a failure of a number of elements of the Tokamak Water Cooling System (TWCS), occurring in the case of LOCA (Loss Of Coolant Accident). In order to mitigate the structural damages, which could be induced by such an accident, a proposed solution consists to connect the VV through a Relief Line (RL) equipped by Rupture Discs (RD) to an auxiliary Pressure Suppression Water Tank (PSWT) system to allow a quick condensation of the <b>released</b> <b>steam</b> under vacuum conditions. The emergency facility, a key system from the safety point of view, is designed to protect the whole integrity of the VV. The Direct Contact Condensation (DCC) of steam in water is the considered process, used to lower the sudden overpressure within the VV. The DCC of steam has been extensively analyzed and experimentally investigated at atmospheric pressures in the past decades. These studies were mainly performed to optimize the design of the pressure suppression systems of boiling water nuclear reactors operating at atmospheric pressure. However, up to date. at subatmospheric pressure conditions, no explicit experimental data are available. To remedy to this lack, we carried out an extended experimental study of the DCC of steam at subatmospheric conditions and different water temperature. For this purpose, we performed numerous condensation tests (about 300 tests) in which the main influencing parameters, such as the steam mass flux (G), water temperature (T) and pool pressure (P) are combined. The tests analyze the condensation regime of steam injected into water at sub-atmospheric pressures, ranging from 4. 2 up to 120 kPa and water pool temperature ranging from 10 up to 85 °C. This experimental study is crucial for a better design of such facilities. It enables a precise prediction of the three-dimensional diagram (G,T,P,) of steam condensation regimes for different steam mass flux (G), water temperature (T) and pool pressure (P). It is {{the scope of this article}} to present and to discuss the main experimental results achieved through this work...|$|E
