Under the control of lawyer-turned CEO Tim O'Toole, the lines were transferred to two newly formed limited liability companies, to be subsidiaries of Conrail but leased to CSX and Norfolk Southern, respectively New York Central Lines (NYC) and Pennsylvania Lines (PRR). The NYC and PRR <b>reporting</b> <b>marks,</b> which had passed to Conrail, were also transferred to the new companies, and NS also acquired the CR reporting mark.

25|$|Although railroads {{were just}} {{beginning}} to see the advantages that autoracks delivered in the 1960s, most North American railroads were reluctant to invest in such specially built equipment. The Trailer Train Company, organized by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1955, stepped in to ease the railroads' financial burden a bit. Trailer Train purchased the flat cars from the rail car manufacturers, and the railroads that wanted to operate autoracks, purchased the racks that were installed on those flat cars. Such cars were easily spotted at trackside due to the <b>reporting</b> <b>marks</b> identifying Trailer Train on the flat car portion of the car and the railroad's logo (usually much larger) in the upper portion of the rack.|$|E
25|$|Every {{piece of}} {{railroad}} rolling stock operating in North American interchange service {{is required to}} carry a standardized set of <b>reporting</b> <b>marks.</b> The marks {{are made up of}} a two- to four-letter code identifying the owner of the equipment accompanied by an identification number and statistics on the equipment's capacity and tare (unloaded) weight. Marks whose codes end in X (such as TTGX) are used on equipment owned by entities that are not common carrier railroads themselves. Marks whose codes end in U are used on containers that are carried in intermodal transport, and marks whose codes end in Z are used on trailers that are carried in intermodal transport, per ISO standard 6346). Most freight cars carry automatic equipment identification RFID transponders.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{extended}} usage of pallet-wide containers in Europe the EU started the Intermodal Loading Unit (ILU) initiative. This showed advantages for intermodal transport of containers and swap bodies. This {{led to the}} introduction of ILU-Codes defined by the standard EN 13044 which has the same format as the earlier BIC-Codes. The International Container Office BIC agreed to only issue ownership codes ending with U, J or Z. The new allocation office of the UIRR (International Union of Combined Road-Rail Transport Companies) agreed to only issue ownership <b>reporting</b> <b>marks</b> for swap bodies ending with A, B, C, D or K – companies having a BIC-Code ending with U can allocate an ILU-Code ending with K having the same preceding letters. Since July 2011 the new ILU codes can be registered, beginning with July 2014 all intermodal ISO containers and intermodal swap bodies must have an ownership code and by July 2019 all of them must bear a standard-conforming placard.|$|E

2500|$|Chicago and North Western {{locomotives}} {{continued to}} operate in their own paint schemes for several years after the merger (although {{some of them were}} gradually repainted into UP colors.) As of 2011, two GE Dash 9-44CW locomotives remain on the UP with CNW logos and <b>reporting</b> <b>marks,</b> #8646 and #8701. Union Pacific has decided to leave these two locomotives in their current condition until either of them suffers a serious mechanical problem, in which they will be overhauled and repainted at Jenks Shop in North Little Rock, Arkansas or retired, depending on how bad the failure is. In addition to this, many former C units have received [...] "patches" [...] with a new road number and reporting mark to match their new owner's roster. Approximately 40 [...] "patched" [...] units remain on the Union Pacific and several others work under different owners. However, it is still possible to find untouched C units in service.

2500|$|The {{name came}} about during merger talks between Chessie System, Inc. and Seaboard System Railroad, Inc., {{commonly}} called [...] "Chessie" [...] and [...] "Seaboard". The company chairmen {{said it was}} important for the new name to include neither of those names because it was a partnership. Employees were asked for suggestions, most of which consisted of combinations of the initials. At the same time a temporary shorthand name was needed for discussions with the Interstate Commerce Commission. [...] "CSC" [...] was chosen but belonged to a trucking company in Virginia. [...] "CSM" [...] (for [...] "Chessie-Seaboard Merger") was also taken. The lawyers decided to use [...] "CSX", and the name stuck. In the public announcement, it was said that [...] "CSX is singularly appropriate. C can stand for Chessie, S for Seaboard, and X, which actually has no meaning." [...] However, an August 9, 2016, article on the Railway Age website stated that [...] " ... the 'X' was for 'Consolidated' [...] ".

All GTW corporate identification and that of its new corporate cousins the Illinois Central Railroad (acquired by CN in 1999) and Wisconsin Central Ltd. (acquired by CN in 2001) are referred to with CN's name and corporate image. However, while each railroad's locomotives would eventually receive CN's logo and black, red-orange and white paint scheme they would still retain their respective <b>reporting</b> <b>marks.</b> Despite the corporate re-branding GTW's blue color scheme and its logo would persist on rolling stock and locomotives for several years while they are slowly either repainted or retired. CN also reintegrated managerial and some operational control of GTW as it would gradually shift out of Detroit and into CN headquarters in Montreal. GTW would continue to maintain some office and dispatching functions from offices in suburban Troy, Michigan. All the [...] routes that make up GTW are part of CN's Midwest Division in its Michigan Zone. Grand Trunk Corporation, now formally headquartered at CN in Montreal, is the holding company for almost all of CN's U.S. properties which include Grand Trunk Western, Illinois Central, Wisconsin Central, Duluth, Winnipeg & Pacific and Great Lakes Transportation which includes the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad and the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway. The Association of American Railroads has considered the Grand Trunk Corporation as a single non-operating Class I Railroad since 2002. Grand Trunk Western still exists as a corporate entity but can now be considered a company on paper.
