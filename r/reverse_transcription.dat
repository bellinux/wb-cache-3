5|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> – David Baltimore {{independently}} isolated, in 1970 at MIT, two RNA tumour viruses: R-MLV {{and again}} RSV.|$|E
5|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> is the {{transfer}} of information from RNA to DNA (the reverse of normal transcription). This is known {{to occur in the}} case of retroviruses, such as HIV, as well as in eukaryotes, in the case of retrotransposons and telomere synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, {{this body}} of {{research}} established the central dogma of molecular biology, which states that proteins are translated from RNA, which is transcribed from DNA. This dogma has since {{been shown to have}} exceptions, such as <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> in retroviruses. The modern study of genetics at the level of DNA is known as molecular genetics.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{store their}} entire genomes {{in the form}} of RNA, and contain no DNA at all. Because they use RNA to store genes, their {{cellular}} hosts may synthesize their proteins as soon as they are infected and without the delay in waiting for transcription. On the other hand, RNA retroviruses, such as HIV, require the <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> of their genome from RNA into DNA before their proteins can be synthesized. RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance has also been observed in plants and very rarely in animals.|$|E
5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses: These have ssRNA (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or dsDNA (Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae) {{in their}} particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA {{intermediate}} to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a reverse transcriptase, or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, {{to carry out}} the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> into the host genome as a provirus {{as a part of the}} replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus. They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine. An example of the first type is HIV, which is a retrovirus. Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae, which includes Hepatitis B virus.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E
5|$|The two nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are {{polymers}} of nucleotides. Each nucleotide {{is composed}} of a phosphate attached to a ribose or deoxyribose sugar group which {{is attached to a}} nitrogenous base. Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis. This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, such as HIV, which uses <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome. RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.|$|E
25|$|The idea of <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> {{was very}} unpopular at first, as it contradicted the central dogma of {{molecular}} biology, {{which states that}} DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. However, in 1970, when the scientists Howard Temin and David Baltimore both independently discovered the enzyme responsible for <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription,</b> named reverse transcriptase, the possibility that genetic information could be passed on in this manner was finally accepted.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> is {{extremely}} error-prone, {{and it is}} during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause drug resistance.|$|E
25|$|Routine {{protocols}} {{to detect}} norovirus in clams and oysters by <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> {{polymerase chain reaction}} are being employed by governmental laboratories such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA.|$|E
25|$|The {{expression}} of hTERT {{can also be}} used to distinguish benign tumors from malignant tumors. Malignant tumors have higher hTERT expression than benign tumors. Real-time <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) quantifying hTERT expression in various tumor samples verified this varying expression.|$|E
25|$|DNA microarrays {{can be used}} {{to detect}} DNA (as in {{comparative}} genomic hybridization), or detect RNA (most commonly as cDNA after <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription)</b> {{that may or may not}} be translated into proteins. The process of measuring gene expression via cDNA is called expression analysis or expression profiling.|$|E
25|$|Post-synthesis {{labeling}} {{avoids the}} problems found in direct enzymatic incorporation of Cy-labeled dNTPs by generating probes with equal labeling effectiveness. With indirect labeling, amine-modified NTPs are incorporated during <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription,</b> RNA amplification, or PCR. Amino allyl-NTPs are incorporated with similar efficiency as unmodified NTPs during polymerization.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} for measuring mRNA abundance is RT-qPCR. In this technique, <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> {{is followed by}} quantitative PCR. <b>Reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> first generates a DNA template from the mRNA; this single-stranded template is called cDNA. The cDNA template is then amplified in the quantitative step, during which the fluorescence emitted by labeled hybridization probes or intercalating dyes changes as the DNA amplification process progresses. With a carefully constructed standard curve, qPCR can produce an absolute measurement {{of the number of}} copies of original mRNA, typically in units of copies per nanolitre of homogenized tissue or copies per cell. qPCR is very sensitive (detection of a single mRNA molecule is theoretically possible), but can be expensive {{depending on the type of}} reporter used; fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes are more expensive than non-specific intercalating fluorescent dyes.|$|E
25|$|AZT is a {{thymidine}} analogue. AZT {{works by}} selectively inhibiting HIV's reverse transcriptase, the enzyme {{that the virus}} uses to make a DNA copy of its RNA. <b>Reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> is necessary for production of HIV's double-stranded DNA, which would be subsequently integrated into the genetic material of the infected cell (where it is called a provirus).|$|E
25|$|If {{yellow fever}} is suspected, the virus cannot be {{confirmed}} until six to 10 {{days after the}} illness. A direct confirmation {{can be obtained by}} <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> polymerase chain reaction where the genome of the virus is amplified. Another direct approach is the isolation of the virus and its growth in cell culture using blood plasma; this can take one to four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Colorado {{tick fever}} virus can be {{detected}} in a patient with a <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), where even a single virion and its genetic material {{can be detected}}. The antigens to the virus can also be detected using immunofluorescence. There is currently no known vaccine or treatment available to treat these Coltiviruses, but 3'-fluors-3'-deoxyadanosine, a nucleoside analog, halts replication of Colorado tick fever virus in vitro.|$|E
25|$|Retrotransposons are transposable {{elements}} which proliferate within eukaryotic genomes {{through a}} process involving <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription.</b> RNA-Seq can provide information about the transcription of endogenous retrotransposons that may influence the transcription of neighboring genes by various epigenetic mechanisms that lead to disease. Similarly, the potential for using RNA-Seq to understand immune-related disease is expanding rapidly due {{to the ability to}} dissect immune cell populations and to sequence T cell and B cell receptor repertoires from patients.|$|E
25|$|A reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) is an enzyme {{used to generate}} complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template, a process termed <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription.</b> It is mainly associated with retroviruses. However, non-retroviruses also use RT (for example, the hepatitis B virus, {{a member of the}} Hepadnaviridae, which are dsDNA-RT viruses, while retroviruses are ssRNA viruses). RT inhibitors are widely used as antiretroviral drugs. RT activities are also associated with the replication of chromosome ends (telomerase) and some mobile genetic elements (retrotransposons).|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{biologists}} {{knew the}} central dogma to be DNA to RNA to protein, with DNA replication {{as the way}} to replicate ones genome. Dr. Huang and Dr. Baltimore unraveled that RNA viruses were different and used RNA polymerase to replicate its RNA genome. With continued researched and publications from other researchers, along with help from Dr. Huang, Dr. Baltimore discovered an enzyme, reverse transcriptase (in a mouse leukemia retrovirus), that converts RNA to DNA (involved in a process now known as <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription).</b> Dr. Baltimore later received the Nobel Prize in 1975 for his discovery.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>Transcription</b> PCR (RT-PCR): for amplifying DNA from RNA. Reverse {{transcriptase}} reverse transcribes RNA into cDNA, {{which is then}} amplified by PCR. RT-PCR is widely used in expression profiling, to determine {{the expression of a}} gene or to identify the sequence of an RNA transcript, including transcription start and termination sites. If the genomic DNA sequence of a gene is known, RT-PCR can be used to map the location of exons and introns in the gene. The 5' end of a gene (corresponding to the transcription start site) is typically identified by RACE-PCR (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends).|$|E
25|$|There are {{two broad}} {{categories}} of hybrid library: random libraries and cDNA-based libraries. A cDNA library is constituted by the cDNA produced through <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> of mRNA collected from specific cells {{of types of}} cell. This library can be ligated into a construct {{so that it is}} attached to the BD or AD being used in the assay. A random library uses lengths of DNA of random sequence in place of these cDNA sections. A number of methods exist for the production of these random sequences, including cassette mutagenesis. Regardless of the source of the DNA library, it is ligated into the appropriate place in the relevant plasmid/phagemid using the appropriate restriction endonucleases.|$|E
25|$|The {{labelled}} {{product is}} generated via <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> and sometimes with an optional PCR amplification. The RNA is reverse transcribed with either polyT primers (which amplify only mRNA) or random primers (which amplify all RNA, {{most of which}} is rRNA); miRNA microarrays ligate an oligonucleotide to the purified small RNA (isolated with a fractionator), which is then reverse transcribed and amplified. The label is added either during the <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> step, or following amplification if it is performed. The sense labelling {{is dependent on the}} microarray; e.g. if the label is added with the RT mix, the cDNA is antisense and the microarray probe is sense, except in the case of negative controls. The label is typically fluorescent; only one machine uses radiolabels. The labelling can be direct (not used) or indirect (requires a coupling stage). For two-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs before hybridization, using aminoallyl uridine triphosphate (aminoallyl-UTP, or aaUTP) and NHS amino-reactive dyes (such as cyanine dyes); for single-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs after hybridization, using biotin and labelled streptavidin. The modified nucleotides (usually in a ratio of 1 aaUTP: 4 TTP (thymidine triphosphate)) are added enzymatically in a low ratio to normal nucleotides, typically resulting in 1 every 60 bases. The aaDNA is then purified with a column (using a phosphate buffer solution, as Tris contains amine groups). The aminoallyl group is an amine group on a long linker attached to the nucleobase, which reacts with a reactive dye. A form of replicate known as a dye flip can be performed to remove any dye effects in two-channel experiments; for a dye flip, a second slide is used, with the labels swapped (the sample that was labeled with Cy3 in the first slide is labeled with Cy5, and vice versa). In this example, aminoallyl-UTP is present in the reverse-transcribed mixture.|$|E
25|$|Four {{thousand}} {{years in the}} future, Human civilization has met its first full antagonist — the Green Exarchy. A system of many civilizations ruled by a non-human emperor, the Green Exarch, represents a significant threat to High Earth. The Green Exarch has at his employ the extremely dangerous shapeshifting (protean) agents known as Vombis. The Dirac is still in common use. High Earth remains the center of Human civilization. That civilization is remarkably advanced — for all practical intents, humans are now immortal. A memory cleanse known as Baptism permits those filled with ennui to begin lives anew, though there are side effects from subconscious recall. A quasi-religious group known as Sagittarians also play a part. The most important financial force in the empire of High Earth is the Traitor's Guild, who permit money to flow from system to system in reward of treachery to system governments, producing a Feudatory system between worlds, though {{not at the expense}} of internal stability. Traitors skilfully employ advanced biotechnology to further their aims, and are known to employ fungal cytotoxins, DNA <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> mutation agents (to inject false memories and appearances in order to forestall recognition and testimony during interrogations), as well as technology to petrify dead bodies in order to make up wall fortifications in far offworld planets. The Traitors Guild may be found on all planets (A Traitor of Quality, Section in The Quincunx of Time with a lecture about the Traitor's Guild, and The Green Exarchy).|$|E
500|$|Francis Crick {{recognized}} the potential significance [...] of the Griffith protein-only hypothesis for scrapie propagation {{in the second}} edition of his [...] "Central dogma of molecular biology" [...] (1970): While asserting that the flow of sequence information from protein to protein, or from protein to RNA and DNA was [...] "precluded", he noted that Griffith's hypothesis was a potential contradiction (although {{it was not so}} promoted by Griffith). [...] The revised hypothesis was later formulated, in part, to accommodate <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> (which both Howard Temin and David Baltimore discovered in 1970).|$|E
500|$|Two RNA genomes are {{encapsidated}} in each HIV-1 particle (see Structure and genome of HIV). Upon {{infection and}} replication catalyzed by reverse transcriptase, recombination {{between the two}} genomes can occur. Recombination occurs as the single-strand (+)RNA genomes are reverse transcribed to form DNA. During <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> the nascent DNA can switch multiple times between the two copies of the viral RNA. This form of recombination is known as copy-choice. Recombination events may occur throughout the genome. [...] From 2 to 20 events per genome may occur at each replication cycle, and these events can rapidly shuffle the genetic information that is transmitted from parental to progeny genomes.|$|E
500|$|The two Tat {{proteins}} (p16 and p14) are transcriptional transactivators for the LTR promoter acting by binding the TAR RNA element. The TAR {{may also}} be processed into microRNAs that regulate the apoptosis genes ERCC1 and IER3. [...] The Rev protein (p19) is involved in shuttling RNAs from the nucleus and the cytoplasm by binding to the RRE RNA element. The Vif protein (p23) prevents the action of APOBEC3G (a cellular protein that deaminates Cytidine to Uridine in the single stranded viral DNA and/or interferes with <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription).</b> [...] The Vpr protein (p14) arrests cell division at G2/M. [...] The Nef protein (p27) down-regulates CD4 (the major viral receptor), {{as well as the}} MHC class I and class II molecules.|$|E
500|$|The {{life cycle}} of [...] virus is complex. [...] {{is one of a}} few known pararetroviruses: non-retroviruses that still use <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> in their {{replication}} process. The virus gains entry into the cell by binding to NTCP [...] on the surface and being endocytosed. Because the virus multiplies via RNA made by a host enzyme, the viral genomic DNA has to be transferred to the cell nucleus by host proteins called chaperones. The partially double-stranded viral DNA is then made fully double stranded by a viral polymerase and transformed into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). This cccDNA serves as a template for transcription of four viral mRNAs by host RNA polymerase. The largest mRNA, (which is longer than the viral genome), is used to make the new copies of the genome and to make the capsid core protein and the viral DNA polymerase. These four viral transcripts undergo additional processing and go on to form progeny virions that are released from the cell or returned to the nucleus and re-cycled to produce even more copies. The long mRNA is then transported back to the cytoplasm where the virion P protein (the DNA polymerase) synthesizes DNA via its reverse transcriptase activity.|$|E
500|$|The dogma is a {{framework}} for understanding the transfer of sequence information between information-carrying biopolymers, in the most common or general case, in living organisms. There are 3 major classes of such biopolymers: DNA and RNA (both nucleic acids), and protein. There are 3×3 = 9 conceivable direct transfers of information that can occur between these. The dogma classes these into 3 groups of 3: three general transfers (believed to occur normally in most cells), three special transfers (known to occur, but only under specific conditions in case of some viruses or in a laboratory), and three unknown transfers (believed never to occur). The general transfers describe the normal flow of biological information: DNA can be copied to DNA (DNA replication), [...] DNA information can be copied into mRNA (transcription), and proteins can be synthesized using the information in mRNA as a template (translation). The special transfers describe: RNA being copied from RNA (RNA replication), DNA being synthesised using an RNA template (<b>reverse</b> <b>transcription),</b> and proteins being synthesised directly from a DNA template {{without the use of}} mRNA. The unknown transfers describe: a protein being copied from a protein, synthesis of RNA using the primary structure of a protein as a template, and DNA synthesis using the primary structure of a protein as a template - these are not thought to naturally occur.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, {{molecular}} {{evidence was}} published indicating that cephalopod chromatophores are photosensitive; <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) revealed transcripts encoding rhodopsin and retinochrome within the retinas and {{skin of the}} longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii), and the common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) and broadclub cuttlefish (Sepia latimanus). [...] The authors claim {{this is the first}} evidence that cephalopod dermal tissues may possess the required combination of molecules to respond to light.|$|E
2500|$|... tat (HIV trans-activator) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in regulating the <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> of viral genome RNA, ensuring efficient synthesis of viral mRNAs and regulating the release of virions from infected cells. Tat is expressed as 72-amino acid one-exon Tat as well as the 86-101 amino-acid two-exon Tat, and {{plays an important}} role early in HIV infection. Tat (14-15kDa) binds to the bulged genomic RNA stem-loop secondary structure near the 5' LTR region forming the trans-activation response element (TAR).|$|E
2500|$|Nevirapine {{falls in}} the non-nucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitor (NNRTI) class of antiretrovirals. [...] Both nucleoside and non-nucleoside RTIs inhibit the same target, the reverse transcriptase enzyme, an essential viral enzyme which transcribes viral RNA into DNA. Unlike nucleoside RTIs, which bind at the polymerase active site, NNRTIs bind to a hydrophobic pocket in the subdomain of p66 which is about 10 angstrom away from the active site (known as the NNRTI pocket). Therefore, this NNRTI-binding pocket will inhibit <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> {{in a way that}} is distinct to the NRTIs.|$|E
2500|$|Reverse {{transcriptase}} {{is commonly}} used in research to apply the polymerase chain reaction technique to RNA in a technique called <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). [...] The classical PCR technique can be applied only to DNA strands, but, {{with the help of}} reverse transcriptase, RNA can be transcribed into DNA, thus making PCR analysis of RNA molecules possible. Reverse transcriptase is used also to create cDNA libraries from mRNA. The commercial availability of reverse transcriptase greatly improved knowledge in the area of molecular biology, as, along with other enzymes, it allowed scientists to clone, sequence, and characterise RNA.|$|E
2500|$|... {{quantitative}} PCR (qPCR): used {{to measure}} the quantity of a target sequence (commonly in real-time). It quantitatively measures starting amounts of DNA, cDNA, or RNA. quantitative PCR is commonly used to determine whether a DNA sequence is present in a sample and the number of its copies in the sample. Quantitative PCR has a very high degree of precision. Quantitative PCR methods use fluorescent dyes, such as Sybr Green, EvaGreen or fluorophore-containing DNA probes, such as TaqMan, to measure the amount of amplified product in real time. It is also sometimes abbreviated to RT-PCR (real-time PCR) but this abbreviation should be used only for <b>reverse</b> <b>transcription</b> PCR. qPCR is the appropriate contractions for quantitative PCR (real-time PCR).|$|E
