5|$|The skeet {{house was}} built around 1925, and is a small one-story log building, three bays wide and one bay deep with a gable roof.

5|$|As of 2014, {{the well}} {{can still be}} seen locked inside a red-brick {{enclosure}} with a steel gate, and its geothermal heat can be felt outside the building. Some plastic chairs, pails and mini-tubs kindly donated by visitors are stored at {{the perimeter of the}} compound, which has a makeshift shed in one corner. A caretaker, paid by Mindef, takes care of the place to ensure its overall cleanliness, but there is no toilet on location. The hot spring is less frequented nowadays but remains <b>rustic</b> for rural and suburban families to discover and explore.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the grape}} was {{fermented}} and shipped north to Tuscany and Piedmont, {{where it was}} used as a blending grape to enhance the body of thin red wines produced in those areas. When the link between Primitivo and Zinfandel began to emerge, plantings in the region and production of non-blended varietal increased. Today most Italian Primitivo is made as a <b>rustic,</b> highly alcoholic red wine with up to 16% alcohol by volume (ABV). Some Italian winemakers age the wines in new American oak to imitate American-style Zinfandel.|$|E

5|$|Mrs. Tiggy-winkle {{has been}} {{described}} as one of Potter's most positive creations, but critics consider Lucie an artistic failure. Although Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is set in an identifiable place and time period, the tale is mythologized by reaching back to an age when household chores were performed manually and without the aid of modern mechanical inventions. The simple dwellings, <b>rustic</b> pathways, and stone fences enhance the tale's timeless aspect and suggest an unchanging countryside and its way of life.|$|E
5|$|The Branqueta is the {{traditional}} dress of the fishermen of Póvoa de Varzim. The Camisola Poveira are pullovers, part of the dress, that have fishery motifs in white, black and red, {{with the name of}} the owner embroidered in siglas poveiras.

Returning to the U.S., where they settled into Lansbury's home in <b>Rustic</b> Canyon, Malibu, in 1951 both became naturalised U.S. citizens, albeit retaining their British citizenship via dual nationality.|$|E
5|$|The film stars Mamatha Bhukya as {{the title}} character: a 15-year-old {{daughter}} of a poor fisherman set in the backdrop of a <b>rustic</b> state of Andhra Pradesh in Southern India.

5|$|The main {{campground}} is in a cypress and sweetgum forest, with 13 campsites {{that are}} open to tents or camping trailers. Each site comes equipped with a picnic table and charcoal grill.

A centrally located bathhouse, open to all campers, includes flush toilets and showers.|$|E

5000|$|Britten {{delineated}} {{the three}} tiers of characters, the <b>rustics</b> being given folk-like [...] "simple" [...] music, the lovers a more romantic sound-world and the fairies being represented {{in a very}} ethereal way. Almost all of the action now {{takes place in the}} woods around Athens, and the fairies inhabit a much more prominent place in the drama. The comic performance by the <b>rustics</b> of Pyramus and Thisbe at the final wedding takes on an added dimension as a parody of nineteenth-century Italian opera. Thisbe's lament, accompanied by obbligato flute, is a parody of a Donizetti [...] "mad scene" [...] ("Il dolce suono").|$|R

5|$|To {{regain his}} strength, Edwards {{and his wife}} took a {{carriage}} to a <b>rustic</b> cottage refuge in Arkville in the Catskill Mountains but isolation, plain food and rest yielded little improvement. A physician was called and he informed Mrs. Edwards {{that there would be}} no recovery for her husband from the advanced Bright's disease with complications from chronic pneumonia so she brought him back to New York City. Edwards died at home at 185 East 116th Street in East Harlem late on June 9, 1891, just hours after returning.|$|E

5|$|Upstream {{from the}} bridge is a grotto and bath house, built in a similar <b>rustic</b> style and presumably by the same architect. The bath house is a square vaulted chamber, with a plunge pool fed by river water. The upper chamber {{comprises}} a circular saloon with windows, although this is now roofless and in poor condition. The original roof was a conical thatched structure, and a niche on the exterior wall may have housed a statue.|$|E
5|$|Additional laws {{focused on}} {{protecting}} the area's <b>rustic</b> and undeveloped character. In 1948, the Thye-Blatnik Bill authorized {{the government to}} purchase the few remaining privately owned homes and resorts within the area. In 1949, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 10092 which prohibited aircraft from flying over the area below 4,000 feet. The area was officially named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 1958. The Wilderness Act of 1964 organized it as {{a unit of the}} National Wilderness Preservation System. The 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act established the Boundary Waters regulations much as they are today, with limitations on motorboats and snowmobiles, a permit-based quota system for recreational access, and restrictions on logging and mining within the area.|$|E
