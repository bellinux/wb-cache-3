5|$|Interactions between organisms {{can produce}} both {{conflict}} and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, {{such as a}} pathogen and a host, or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution. An example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough-skinned newt {{and the evolution of}} tetrodotoxin <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> its predator, the common garter snake. In this predator-prey pair, an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> the snake.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a Crusader {{force of}} between 500 and 700 knights {{under the command}} of William of Champlitte and Geoffrey I of Villehardouin {{advanced}} into the Peloponnese to deal with Byzantine <b>resistance.</b> <b>In</b> the Olive Grove of Kountouras in Messenia, they confronted an army of around 5,000 Peloponnesian Greeks {{under the command of}} a certain Michael. In the ensuing battle, the Crusaders emerged victorious, forcing the Byzantines to retreat and crushing <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> the Peloponnese. This battle {{paved the way for the}} foundation of the Principality of Achaea.|$|E

5|$|On June 16, nearly {{identical}} ultimata were issued to Latvia and Estonia, {{although they were}} given only eight hours to respond.

5|$|Prisoners {{had little}} effect on the <b>{{resistance}}</b> <b>in</b> France. Initially there were three resistance networks based around repatriated prisoners split along political lines, but in March 1944, the three merged to form the National Movement of Prisoners of War and Deportees.|$|E

5000|$|There were losses {{incurred}} in {{the conversion}} of electrical energy to kinetic and back again, but Raworth mitigated this in the control mechanism. Instead of having large, heavily built <b>resistances</b> <b>in</b> the power lines for the motors, the 26 taps on the controller changed <b>resistances</b> <b>in</b> the field coils of the generator. These correspondingly made the construction much lighter and more easily maintained. Instead of [...] "burning-up" [...] unrequired power, the controller simply altered how much power was generated.|$|R
5|$|The {{deportation}} of Belgian workers proved {{insufficient to}} meet German industrial needs {{and had little}} effect economically. Politically, however, it led to widespread condemnation in Belgium and internationally, helping {{the rise of the}} <b>resistance.</b> <b>In</b> late 1917, under pressure from neutral powers, most of the Belgian deported workers were returned.|$|E

5|$|After the {{operation}} closed, {{at the end}} of June 1944, the threat of invasion from the United States was informally kept alive. It was revisited as Ironside II in mid-July as support for Operation Ferdinand.

40|$|Abstract. Accuracy {{measures}} of open circuit transfer {{functions of the}} arbitrary variable arm resistances of the bridge supplied by current or voltage, are presented.

5|$|Anti-communist <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> Poland {{was also}} bolstered, {{and a group}} of {{opposition}} leaders and cultural figures founded the Klub Krzywego Koła (Skewed Wheel Club) in Warsaw. It promoted discussions about Polish independence, questioned the efficiency of the state controlled economy, and government disdain and even persecution of veterans of the Polish Armed Forces in the West and the Armia Krajowa resistance during World War II. While the intelligentsia expressed their dissatisfaction with discussions and publications (bibuła), workers took to the streets. The living conditions in Poland did not improve, contrary to government propaganda, and workers increasingly found that they had little power compared to bureaucracy of the Party (nomenklatura).|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} more {{spectacular}} pieces of <b>resistance,</b> <b>in</b> some places chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners {{to pay them}} to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, William Dowsing was commissioned {{to the task of}} image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, was enormous. In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing and for many, the sale of vestments and plate was an opportunity to make money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated more deeply into popular thinking).|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the origin of}} non-ideal transfer characteristics in graphene-based three-branch nano-junction (TBJ) devices. Fabricated graphene TBJs often show asymmetric nonlinear voltage transfer characteristic, although symmetric one should appear ideally. A simple model considering the contact <b>resistances</b> <b>in</b> two input electrodes is deduced and it suggests that the non-ideal characteristic arises from inequality of the metal-graphene contact <b>resistances</b> <b>in</b> the inputs. We fabricate a graphene TBJ device with electrically equal contacts by optimizing the contact formation process and almost ideal nonlinear characteristic was successfully demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{modeling}} {{of the gas}} absorption in a new column apparatus for waste gases purification from SО 2, using two-phase absorbent (CaCO 3 / H 2 O suspension) is presented. The process is realized in a three-zone column. In the upper zone a physical absorption in gas-liquid drops system is realized and the big convective transfer in the gas phase leads to a decrease of the mass transfer <b>resistances</b> <b>in</b> this phase. In the middle zone a chemical absorption in liquid-gas bubbles system takes place and the big convective transfer in the liquid phase leads to a decrease of the mass transfer <b>resistances</b> <b>in</b> this phase. The large volume of the liquid in the middle zone causes an increase of the chemical reaction time {{and as a result}} a further decrease of the mass transfer <b>resistances</b> <b>in</b> the liquid phases is realized. The third zone is the column tank, where the chemical reaction takes place only...|$|R
5|$|As elsewhere, {{sabotage}} {{was employed}} against enemy {{military and economic}} assets, with railway lines and bridges being common targets. The activities of Groupe G, a small student resistance cell based in Brussels, alone are estimated to have cost the Nazis 10 million man-hours of labour to repair damages done. Direct attacks on German troops and military installations were rarer, yet one estimate puts the number of German soldiers killed by the Belgian <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> 1941 as higher than in all of France.|$|E

5|$|Boris {{was the son}} of Eufemia of Kiev, King Coloman of Hungary's second wife, {{whom the}} king {{expelled}} on the charge of adultery before Boris's birth. According to the chronicler Bishop Otto of Freising, Boris approached Conrad III of Germany to seek his assistance against Géza at the end of 1145. Upon the recommendation of Vladislav II of Bohemia, the German monarch authorized Boris to muster an army of mercenaries in Bavaria and Austria. Boris stormed Hungary and took the fortress of Pressburg (present-day Bratislava in Slovakia). The royal forces soon imposed a blockade on the fortress and convinced Boris's mercenaries to surrender without <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> exchange for compensation.|$|E

Steady state systems can be modelled by networks of such thermal <b>resistances</b> <b>in</b> series and in parallel, in exact analogy to electrical networks of resistors. See purely resistive thermal circuits for an example of such a network.|$|R
