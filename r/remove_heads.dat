He also opposed giving the president the power to <b>remove</b> <b>heads</b> of cabinet departments without the advice and consent of the Senate. In August 1790, the administration negotiated the Treaty of New York with the Creek Indians, which greatly angered many in Georgia. Gunn voted against the treaty.

5000|$|In reality, {{the high}} {{turnover}} rate among these commissioners or board members means that most presidents {{have the opportunity}} to fill enough vacancies to constitute a voting majority on each independent agency commission within {{the first two years of}} the first term as president. In some famous instances, presidents have found the independent agencies more loyal and in lockstep with the president's wishes and policy objectives than some dissenters among the executive agency political appointments. [...] Presidential attempts to remove independent agency officials have generated most of the important Supreme Court legal opinions in this area. Presidents normally do have the authority to <b>remove</b> <b>heads</b> of independent agencies, but they must meet the statutory requirements for removal, such as demonstrating that the individual has committed malfeasance. In contrast, the president can remove regular executive agency heads at will.|$|E

40|$|The Supreme Court’s 1935 Humphrey’s Executor {{decision}} {{paved the}} way for the modern administrative state by holding that Congress could constitutionally limit the President’s powers to <b>remove</b> <b>heads</b> of regulatory agencies. The Court articulated a quartet of features of the Federal Trade Commission’s (“FTC”) statutory design that ostensibly justified the Commission’s constitutional independence. It was to be nonpartisan and apolitical, uniquely expert, and performing quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial, rather than executive, functions. In recent years, the staying power of Humphrey’s Executor has been called into question as a matter of constitutional design. This Essay reconsiders Humphrey’s Executor from a different angle. At the end of a one hundred- year natural experiment, the Commission bears almost no resemblance to the Progressive-technocratic vision articulated by the Court. The Commission is not politically independent, uniquely expert, or principally legislative or adjudicative. Rather, it is essentially a law enforcement agency beholden to the will of Congress. This finding has potentially important implications for agency design, constitutional doctrine and theory, and understanding of agency functioning...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Noel Derecki, James Cronk & Jonathan Kipnis ### Abstract Here, we {{describe}} a protocol in which single cells are isolated acutely from adult mouse brains, made into single cell suspensions, depleted of myelin debris, then stained for markers to determine microglial contents. Cells are fixed and read on a multicolor flow cytometer. ### Procedure 1. Perfuse mouse thoroughly transcardially with pH 7. 4 0. 1 M PBS - <b>Remove</b> <b>heads</b> with scissors. - Strip skulls of soft tissues. - Remove mandibles. - Remove all skull material rostral to maxillae. - With surgical scissors, remove tops of skulls, cutting clockwise, {{beginning and ending}} inferior to the right post-tympanic hook. - Scoop out brain, maintaining tissue integrity. - Place brains immediately in ice-cold FACS buffer (pH 7. 4 0. 1 M PBS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 % BSA, 50 U/ml DNAseI). If you plan also to label neurons, l-Glutamine/Glutamax should be added to buffer to limit neuronal death during preparation. - Carefully strip meninges (dura mater, arachnoid mater and pia mater) from the exterior surfaces of brains with Dumont # 5 forceps. - Using a scalpel, with a coronal cut, separate brain into cerebrum and cerebellum/brainstem. - Using forceps, separate cerebellum from brainstem; carefully peel out meningeal lining of the fourth ventricle. - Using a scalpel, bisect the cerebrum longitudinally and carefully peel out the choroid plexus and associated meningeal tissue. - Further dissect into desired brain areas for analysis (e. g. hippocampus, neocortex, etc.). - Transfer brain tissue to a 15 mL Tenbroeck homogenizer containing 10 ml ice-cold facs buffer. - Break up tissue with three gentle strokes. - Press crude homogenate through a 70 μm nylon mesh cell strainer with a plastic plunger, two times in serial, to yield a single cell suspension. - Centrifuge cells at 1200 RPM at 4 ºC for 10 minutes with no brake, remove supernatant, re-suspend cells in ice-cold FACS buffer. - Remove myelin using Miltenyi AutoMACS and myelin removal beads according to manufacturer’s instructions. - Wash cells 1 X with FACS buffer, centrifuge cells at 1100 RPM at 4 ºC for 10 minutes with no brake, remove supernatant, re-suspend cells in 100 ul ice-cold FACS buffer and transfer cells to FACS tubes. - Label cells for extracellular microglial markers with antibodies each to CD 11 b, CD 45, fixable live/dead dye, and any other desired markers (i. e. GFAP, NeuN, CD 3 e, etc.) for 30 m at 4 º; keep protected from light. - Wash cells 2 times as in Step 19. - Resuspend cells in 100 - 400 ul 1 % PFA in 0. 1 M pH 7. 4 PBS. Vortex and store at 4 º C protected from light. - Read cells on a multicolor flow cytometer. - To obtain equivalent and accurate cell counts, gate first using LIVE/DEAD, selecting live cells, then pulse width vs. area to select singlet cells, forward scatter vs. side scatter to eliminate debris, then by appropriate markers for cell type (e. g. CD 11 b for myeloid-derived cells). Microglia will be a CD 45 Low CD 11 b High population; peripheral leukocytes will express high levels of CD 45. ### Timing - Perfusion, brain isolation, dissection; 25 m. - Homogenization, single-cell suspension; 15 m. - Staining, fixation; ~ 1 h. ### Anticipated Results Displayed in Figure 1. is a gating scheme illustrating a strategy for selecting single events, “cell-sized” events, CD 45 low cells, and in the example shown, populations of GFP-positive and GFP-negative microglia and “microglia-like” engrafted cells isolated from a mouse transplanted with GFP-positive bone marrow. ### Figures **Figure 1 : Microglial isolation workflow** [Download Figure 1]([URL] - *a.
