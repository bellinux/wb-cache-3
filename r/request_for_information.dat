5|$|On 19 December 2009, President Obama {{signed a}} joint House and Senate Defense Appropriation Bill for FY 2010, which {{includes}} $130million {{funding for the}} Marine One program: $100million to recoup technologies developed under the VH-71 Kestrel program, and $30million for the Navy's initial studies on a new VH-XX program. In February 2010, the Navy issued a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>information</b> to the aviation industry. In April 2010, Lockheed Martin announced they would team with Sikorsky in offering the Sikorsky S-92 instead of the VH-71. In June 2010, Boeing announced it was considering a U.S.-built licensed version of the AgustaWestland AW101 for the renewed VXX program {{as well as the}} Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey and Boeing CH-47 Chinook.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015 the Finnish MoD sent {{a letter}} to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the US informing them that the fighter project had been {{launched}} in the Defence Forces. The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet, which will be decommissioned as of 2025, with multi-role fighters. The project has been named the HX Fighter Program. The JAS-39 is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. The <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>information</b> concerning the HX Fighter Program was sent in April 2016. The five responses were received in November 2016. The official Request for Quotation will be sent to all five aircraft manufacturers that provided responses to the RFI, through their four governments, in the spring of 2018. The goal is to start the fighter candidates’ environmental testing in Finland in 2019. The buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021.|$|E
5|$|On 8 September 1966, General McConnell {{ordered that}} a {{specialized}} CAS aircraft be designed, developed, and obtained; on 22 December, a Requirements Action Directive (RAD) was issued for the A-X CAS airplane, and the Attack Experimental (A-X) program office was formed. On 6 March 1967, the Air Force released a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>information</b> to 21 defense contractors for the A-X. The {{objective was to}} create a design study for a low-cost attack aircraft. In 1969, the Secretary of the Air Force asked Pierre Sprey to write the detailed specifications for the proposed A-X project; Sprey's initial involvement was kept secret due to his earlier controversial involvement in the F-X project. Sprey's discussions with Skyraider pilots operating in Vietnam and analysis of aircraft used in the role indicated the ideal aircraft should have long loiter time, low-speed maneuverability, massive cannon firepower, and extreme survivability; possessing the best elements of the Ilyushin Il-2, Henschel Hs 129, and Skyraider. The specifications also demanded that each aircraft cost less than $3million. Sprey required that the biography of World War II Luftwaffe attack pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel be read by people on the A-X program.|$|E

25|$|The {{motivation}} for the withdrawal of co-proxamol was the reduction in suicides and {{a key part of}} the agency's justification of its decision was based upon studies showing co-proxamol was no more effective than paracetamol alone in pain management.

25|$|During {{his years}} in Cornwall, Lewis credits Kranich with {{introducing}} useful innovations at Sir Francis Godolphin's tin works, among them the hydraulic stamp mill and improved methods of dressing ore, {{as well as the}} use of charcoal as fuel for smelting instead of the traditional peat. However Lewis also allows for the possibility that these innovations should be credited to Daniel Hoechstetter. Richard Carew, on the other hand, mentions the 'rubble of certain mines and remains of a fining house' which demonstrate Kranich's 'vain endeavour in seeking of silver ore' in Cornwall. After Kranich had left Cornwall, a 16-page memorandum was prepared by William Carnsew 'relating to silver and lead mines in Cornwall and activities of Dr Burchard Kranich' in response to a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>information</b> about the potential profitability of the mines from Piers Edgcumbe of Cotehele. Among the matters covered in the memorandum were 'the many disputes and arguments Kranich had with his sponsors'. According to Wallis, Kranich's mining enterprises in the West Country were ultimately a failure, and he moved to London.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the driving}} {{requirements}} for the new trainer will be to help prepare pilots for the increased complexity in some areas, particularly information management, that {{are a part of}} fifth generation jet fighters like the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II. The Air Force first viewed this as unnecessary and costly, but industry analysis showed it to be cheaper in the long run. The aircraft and simulation system will have to fulfill several basic training roles; basic aircraft control, airmanship, formation, instrument and navigation, advanced air-to-air, advanced air-to-ground, and advanced crew/cockpit resource management. Furthermore, there are five advanced training roles that the system is expected to fulfill; sustained high-G operations at 6.5–7.5g, aerial refueling, night vision imaging systems operations, air-to-air intercepts, and data-link operations. The 2009 <b>Request</b> <b>For</b> <b>Information</b> (RFI) mentions that some tasks, such as aerial refueling, may be performed in the simulator and not on the aircraft itself. Aircraft availability is to be 80%, but not higher, as that would drive cost too high. Program requirements focus on life-cycle costs rather than just purchase price.|$|E
25|$|The F-15I is {{operated}} by the Israeli Defence Force/Air Force No 69 Squadron, which had previously operated the F-4 Phantom II. After the Gulf War in 1991, in which Israeli towns were attacked by SCUD missiles based in Iraq, the Israeli government decided that it needed a long range strike aircraft and issued a <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Information</b> (RFI). In response, Lockheed Martin offered {{a version of the}} F-16 Fighting Falcon, while McDonnell Douglas offered both the F/A-18 Hornet and the F-15E. On 27 January 1994, the Israeli government announced their intention to purchase 21 modified F-15Es, designated F-15I. On 12 May 1994, the US Government authorized the purchase of up to 25 F-15Is by Israel. In November 1995, Israel ordered four extra F-15Is, thus 25 were built from 1996 to 1998. The aircraft can carry: the AIM-9L, Rafael Python 4 and the Rafael Python 5 infrared-homing missiles; and the AIM-7 Sparrow and the AIM-120 AMRAAM radar-guided missiles. In 1999, Israel announced its intention to procure more fighter aircraft, and the F-15I was a possible contender. However, it was announced that the contract would go to the F-16I.|$|E

500|$|On 24 October 2015, Sweden {{announced}} its bid of the JAS 39 Gripen C/D for Croatia's fighter replacement requirement, following a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>information</b> from the Croatian Ministry of Defence in June for between 8 and 12 newly built aircraft {{to replace the}} Croatian fleet of ageing MiG-21bis aircraft. According to the Ministry of Defence's Long-Term Development Plan (LTDP), however, the MiG-21 is to remain in service until 2024 {{as a result of}} ongoing modernisation programmes. [...] The LTDP will run from 2015 to 2024 and is scheduled to have funding available for a replacement aircraft in 2019. Second-hand F-16s from another country may also be considered.|$|E
500|$|In August 2014, the U.S. {{military}} {{issued a}} <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>information</b> (RFI) {{for a potential}} drop-in replacement for the AE-1107C engines.

In September 2014, the US Navy was considering contracting for an alternative engine supplier {{in order to reduce}} costs. In the V-22 program, the Navy purchases engines separately from the aircraft themselves. The General Electric GE38 has been considered as a replacement, providing commonality with the CH-53K King Stallion.|$|E
