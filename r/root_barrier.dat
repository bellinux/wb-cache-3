In Western Australia (WA), treatment and control plots were set-up along an active disease front within scrub-heath vegetation dominated by Banksia spp. Treatments, applied sequentially and in combination, included: 1) destruction of the largest plants within disease free vegetation forward of the disease front; 2) destruction of all plants to create a ‘dead zone’; 3) installation of physical <b>root</b> <b>barriers</b> and subsurface irrigation for the application of fungicide/s; 4) surface applications of fungicides selective against oomycetes (triadiazole and metalaxyl-M), and 5) surface injection and deep (± 1 m) treatments with Metham-sodium.

40|$|Intercropping is a {{promising}} model for ecological intensification of modern agriculture. Little {{information is available}} on how species growth patterns are affected by size-asymmetric above- and belowground competitive interactions, especially in intercrops with more than two species. We studied plant growth and competitive interactions in a novel intercropping system with three species: wheat, watermelon and maize. Wheat and maize are grown sequentially (as a double cropping system) in narrow strips while watermelon is grown between the cereal strips, with partial overlap in growing period with the two cereals. Growth patterns were monitored over two years and described with logistic growth curves. <b>Root</b> <b>barriers</b> were used to study the effect of belowground interactions. Wheat produced 31 % greater yield per plant in the intercrop than in the sole crop but 24 % lower yield per unit total (inter) crop area. Wheat yield increase per plant was associated with faster growth and substantial overyielding in the outer rows of wheat strips. Watermelon did not competitively affect wheat. Watermelon biomass was substantially reduced {{at the time of}} wheat harvest. However, compensatory growth after wheat harvest and greater allocation to fruits resulted in a good yield of intercropped watermelon, 92 % of monoculture yields, at final harvest. Intercropped maize produced 32 % lower grain yield per plant and per unit area than sole maize, as a consequence of later sowing and a changed plant configuration in the intercrop as compared to the sole crop, and competitive effects of watermelon, as shown by comparison with a skip-row maize system without watermelon. <b>Root</b> <b>barriers</b> did not affect yield of any of the species, indicating that aboveground competitive interactions in this case played a more important role in shaping the observed growth responses than belowground interactions.

50|$|Grass or turf roofs {{have been}} around since the Viking times if not far earlier and make for a {{decorative}} and durable roof covering. Green roofs have been made by depositing topsoil or other growth media on flat roofs and seeding them (or allowing them to self-seed as nature takes its course). Maintenance in the form of simple visible inspection and removal of larger rooting plants has allowed these roofs to be successful in that they provide an excellent covering and UV light barrier for the roof waterproofing membrane. With some systems, the manufacturer requires that a <b>root</b> <b>barrier</b> membrane be laid above the waterproofing membrane.

50|$|As {{a result}} of their {{intricately}} entangled above-ground root systems, mangrove communities protect shorelines during storm events by absorbing wave energy and reducing the velocity of water passing through the <b>root</b> <b>barrier.</b> In addition, mangroves protect intertidal sediment along coastlines from eroding away in harsh weather year round. As new cities are developed, mangrove forests around the world have felt a great impact not only on their ecosystems health, but also their wave-attenuating capacity. Wave energy may be reduced by 75 per cent in the wave's passage through 200 meters of mangrove forests, a very substantial amount once the mangrove has been removed. Mangrove covered shorelines are less likely to erode, or will erode significantly more slowly, than unvegetated shorelines during periods of high wave energy. Other factors mangroves have an influence on, include coastal profile, water depth and bottom configuration. The mangrove population has felt both direct and indirect effects due to coastal engineering and human development, resulting in a devastating decline in population. This decline has led to a negative chain of effects in other ecosystems that are dependent on mangrove forest for survival. In just the last decade, at least 35 percent of the world's mangroves have been destroyed, exceeding the rate of the disappearance of tropical rainforests. Mangroves provide a number of essentials for many different ecosystems, including food and shelter for a diverse animal community, living both below and above sea level. Maintaining a healthy mangrove forest sustains natural protection and is less expensive than seawalls and similar erosion control structures, which can increase erosion in front of the structure and at adjacent properties due to coastal currents. Unless ecosystems have the space to adjust their location or elevation in the intertidal zone to the sea-level rise, they will be stressed by changed inundation periods. The Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) has risen 4 to 8 inches over the past century, almost twice the average rate of 80 years prior. It appears that as the sea-level is slowly rising, mangroves are a better alternative to protecting coastlines from eroding than other man made structures, such as seawalls.|$|E

First, tree crown sizes were measured on GIS-based aerial photography to estimate root distributions. The results were compared with vegetation maps that were created based on field observations. The GIS-based measurements and field measurements showed similar values if the site was covered with a simple vegetation community. Simple canopy shapes improved the precision of the measurements. However, the GIS-based measurement was not accurate for a site with complex vegetation coverage. The bench-top experiment was conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} two types of geosynthetics as <b>root</b> <b>barriers.</b> A geotextile and a geocomposite were tested in v clear columns filled with soil and/or gravel to simulate six different drainage designs. Two New Mexican plants, Rio Grande cottonwood (Populus deltoides ssp. wislizeni) and coyote willow (Salix exigua), were selected, and planted in columns. The results showed roots of both species could penetrate through the geotextile and geocomposite. Also, root growth was not affected by the types of <b>root</b> <b>barriers</b> nor drainage material. For the last study element, HYDRUS- 2 D was applied to understand the soil water movement in the levee. The typical toe drain and the geocomposite edge drain were considered, and the models were run under the ambient condition (unsaturated) and the flood condition (saturated). As a result, the functions of both drainage designs were close to identical under the ambient condition since it did not result in drainage.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from September 4, 2015 - September 4, 2017 Ecoroofs have become more prominent in recent years. However, there is currently no enforceable standard or building code for the design and construction of ecoroofs across the United States (Kraupa, 2014). Further {{research is needed to}} determine how ecoroofs respond to roof motion and to develop an appropriate design standard. The work herein attempts to examine the complete ecoroof system and its response when subjected to motion. Direct shear interface testing was performed to determine the coefficient of friction at the interface between each layer of the ecoroof. The interfaces were tested under both dry and submerged conditions for soil depths of 100 mm (4 in), 300 mm (12 in), and 900 mm (36 in) to model both extensive and intensive soil conditions. These coefficients of friction tell at which interface the system is most susceptible to sliding, and at what point this sliding will begin. When <b>root</b> <b>barrier</b> is used, its interfaces are critical to sliding. When <b>root</b> <b>barrier</b> is excluded from the ecoroof system, the insulation board / Tremco drain mat & filter fabric interface is most susceptible to sliding. Additionally, a shake table was designed and built to subject model ecoroofs to linear motion. Model ecoroofs of varying soil densities, moisture conditions, and slopes were subjected to haversine acceleration pulses. The goals of this testing were to access the potential for soil decoupling from the roof, to determine the extent of this decoupling, to determine how decoupling is impacted by roof slope, soil density, and moisture conditions, and to determine which intensity measure or measures best predicted the observed decoupling. It was determined soil decouples from the roof when velocity exceeds a critical threshold. The magnitude of decoupling is greatest under submerged soil conditions, greater for loose than for dense soil placements, and generally increases with increasing roof slope.

Shoot:root ratios and ratios of horizontally- to vertically-oriented proximal roots were not affected by weeding. Growth of clonal rubber in N-fertilised plots, in the presence of weeds, was significantly greater than in corresponding unfertilised plots, indicating that N-addition may overcome some negative effects of competition in the system. However, a bioassay of nutrient limitation showed no significant differences in root biomass or root-length density, for either rubber or weed rootingrowth into soil cores enriched with various nutrients.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 In an {{agrisilviculture}} system, {{trees and}} crops compete for {{above and below}} ground resources. This study aimed at quantifying the effect of shoot pruning and <b>root</b> <b>barriers</b> around pollarded trees on the production of crop and tree components with and without application of fertilizer to the crop. Sorghum (1991 & 1992) and cowpea (1993 & 1994) were grown as intercrops with Lezicaena trees on a shallow red soil (alfisol) under rain fed conditions at Hyderabad, India. Crops grown with pruned trees had higher leaf area index and dry matter than did those with unpruned trees. The grain yield of sorghum was 76 % and 39 % of the pure crop yield (1553 kg ha⁻¹) with pruned and unpruned trees with no <b>root</b> <b>barriers.</b> The corresponding values for cowpea were 49 % and 26 % of the pure crop yield (1075 kg ha⁻¹). Intercropped sorghum and cowpea responded to fertilizer application more strongly than their respective pure crops, suggesting a need for fertilizer application in an agrisilvi-system. impact of root bamers was not significant on either crop. The study suggested that competition for light was stronger than for soil water. Straw and grain yield of sorghum, and dry matter yield of cowpea {{were found to be}} roughly proportional to the amount of light intercepted by the crop at harvest. Pruning of trees twice during the cropping season reduced tree diameter growth and branch and foliage yield compared to no pruning. Unpruned trees yielded 5643 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ of branches and foliage compared to 2028 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ by pruned trees. Pruning eliminated litter fall and nutrient input to the soil nutrient pool because pruned material was utilized as fodder. Unpruned trees contributed 103 kg of nitrogen and 6. 4 kg of phosphorus per hectare annually to the soil nutrient pool through litter fall. During the cropping season, soil water content was higher near the surface in tree plots compared to pure crop plots. Tree transpiration declined only after {{more than half of the}} leaf area was removed. Pruning of roots to a depth of 60 cm caused no decline in transpiration suggesting trees can draw water equally well from deeper or shallow soil layers. The study highlighted the competitive interaction between trees and crops. The agrisilvi-system produced about 50 % more biomass with unpruned trees than with pure crop or pure tree. Based on cash value (fodder yield equivalent) it would require 1. 55 times as much land if trees and crops were grown separately compared to agrisilvi-system with unpruned trees. Soil nitrogen economy and stability of fodder and fuelwood production can be achieved with pollarded-unpruned leucaena trees in an agrisilvi-system but grain crop yields are severely depressed. Thus, there was little advantage of the agrisilvi-system over pure cropping for meeting the present and increasing demand of food production. For this agrisilvi-system to be adopted by subsistence farmers in India further refinements must be developed so that crop yields are maintained...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{architecture}} {{and the structure}} of maize roots grown in hydroponics, aeroponics and soil. No significant differences were found in number of root apices per unit of weight and root surface per unit of weight between the three cultivation methods. The only difference was found in distances from the root apex where <b>root</b> apoplastic <b>barriers</b> are being formed. Formation of barriers in hydroponics is more distant from the root apex, resulting in higher proportion of barrier-free areas comparing to aeroponically and soil grown roots. This may explain previously found differences in cadmium uptake between the different cultivation conditions...|$|R
