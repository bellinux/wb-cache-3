5|$|The {{influence}} {{continued through}} the 20th century. Gerald Kelly recalled Bertin when painting his <b>restless</b> <b>and</b> confined series of portraits of Ralph Vaughan Williams in 1952–61. In 1975 Marcel Broodthaers produced a series of nine black and white photographs on board based on Ingres' portraits of Bertin and Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{his army}} service in 1919, Marquis was <b>restless</b> <b>and</b> unsure of his future path. He first {{restarted}} the practice at Livingston and sold the house at Clyde Park (retaining some land there as a legacy for his daughters). He then decided to move to Whitehall, where he spent more and more of his time writing, at first on his wartime experiences, and then short articles on diverse subjects collected into volumes. He also wrote short stories during this period. However, he could not find a publisher.|$|E
5|$|The three legions in Pannonia (VIII Augusta, XIX Hispana, and XV Apollinaris) {{were under}} the command of Junius Blaesus, who allowed his men a rest from {{military}} duties to mourn the death of Augustus. There was a breakdown in discipline, and the soldiers stopped obeying orders as a result. They soon became <b>restless</b> <b>and</b> lashed out against their officers, including Blaesus and a centurion named Aufidienus Rufus. Having been dispatched with two Praetorian cohorts, Drusus and Praetorian prefect Sejanus reached the Pannonian legions at Emona on 26 September.|$|E

5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them <b>restless,</b> <b>and</b> caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E
5|$|A {{farmer and}} his son were {{ploughing}} a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled {{after one of the}} horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement. Once harnessed to the wooden plough the horse appeared to be familiar with the task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became <b>restless</b> <b>and</b> the farmer gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the plough and the other three horses with it. The frightened farmer {{and his son}} watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and plough with it. Seven hours later there was still no sign of the three horses.|$|E
5|$|As the day progresses, Rick's son Carl (Chandler Riggs) becomes <b>restless</b> <b>and</b> sneaks {{into the}} barn to observe Randall; Randall tries to {{convince}} Carl to release him. Shane discovers Carl's presence and scolds him. Outside, Carol (Melissa McBride) attempts to cheer Carl up by reminding him Sophia is in heaven, but he lashes out at her. Carl ends up taking a gun from Daryl's stash and heading into the nearby swamp alone. He finds a walker half-stuck in mud, and taunts it by throwing rocks at it and then moves in close to shoot it in the head. The walker suddenly frees one of its legs and lurches forward; Carl panics and drops the gun before running back to camp, not telling anyone what happened. Meanwhile, Beth (Emily Kinney) has since recovered from her earlier suicide attempt. When Glenn (Steven Yeun) comes {{to check on her}} condition, Hershel (Scott Wilson) gives him a family heirloom representing his approval of Glenn's relationship with his daughter Maggie (Lauren Cohan).|$|E

5|$|The Democratic nominating {{convention}} {{began on}} June 20, at the Music Hall on Market Street in Louisville. The {{first order of}} business was to nominate a convention chairman. Ollie M. James, a supporter of Stone, nominated Judge David Redwine. When Woodson seconded the nomination, the deal between Stone and Goebel became apparent to all. Hardin supporters nominated William H. Sweeney, but the Stone-Goebel alliance elected Redwine. The membership of several county delegations was challenged; these cases would be decided by the credentials committee. This committee was also stacked against Hardin; his supporters made up just four of the thirteen members. Prolonged deliberations by the credentials committee caused the delegates to become <b>restless,</b> <b>and</b> hundreds of people—both delegates and non-delegates—entered the Music Hall attempting to disrupt the convention. When Redwine summoned Louisville city police to the hall to maintain order, Hardin supporters accused him of using intimidation tactics. The credentials committee finally issued its report on June 23. Of the twenty-eight cases where delegates were contested, twenty-six of them were decided in favor of Goebel or Stone supporters.|$|E
5|$|The Dhumavati Tantra {{describes}} {{her as an}} old and ugly widow. She is thin, tall, unhealthy, and has a pale complexion. She is described as <b>restless</b> <b>and</b> wicked. Unadorned with jewellery, she wears old, dirty clothes and has dishevelled hair. Her eyes are fearsome, her nose long and crooked, {{and some of her}} long fang-like teeth have fallen out, leaving her smile with gaps. Her ears are ugly and rough; her breasts hang down. In one of her trembling hands, she holds a winnowing basket, while the other makes a boon-conferring gesture (varada-mudra) or knowledge-giving gesture (cinmudra). She rides in a horseless chariot bearing an emblem of a crow and a banner. She is astute and crafty, though. Always hungry and thirsty, Dhumavati initiates quarrels and invokes fear.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottoman {{failure at}} the Battle of Vienna (11–12 September 1683), {{the people of}} Ravni Kotari and Kninska Krajina {{assembled}} {{under the leadership of}} Stojan's brother Ilija Janković and attacked the Ottomans. Pivljanin and his brother joined the band. The Venetians, in order to avoid a war, recalled Stojan Janković to Venice in October, calming Ilija, who is described as very <b>restless</b> <b>and</b> unmanageable. Dalmatian provveditore Lorenzo Dona sent colonel Ivan Radoš to the hajduks to calm them down and return them home. Radoš informed Dona on 10 November 1683 that he had met with Pivljanin, Vid Kalinić and Andrija Gilim at Kula Atlagića, who asked him to forward their request of forgiveness to the provveditore, then summoned Ilija Janković and Jovan Baljak. They all promised to follow Dona's command and stop hostility against Ottomans. When the hajduks calmed down by which time much of northern Dalmatia was in their handsthe Venetians returned Stojan to Ravni Kotari in December. In a letter dated 8December 1683, provveditore Dona forgave Pivljanin for desertion, and ordered his return in the list of cavalry bands which he had been part of, and gave him back wages for the intervening time.|$|E

5|$|Fran {{once lived}} with her sisters Jote and Mjrn in Eruyt Village, the secluded Viera {{settlement}} in Golmore Jungle, but became <b>restless</b> <b>and</b> desired to see the outside world. This was {{a major source of}} conflict between her and the other viera, especially her elder sister Jote, who served as the village matriarch. Fran argued that although all Viera begin their lives in the forest, they are not necessarily bound to remain there to the end. When the party encounters an impassable Viera barrier on the path through Golmore, Fran is forced to return to the village and ask for help. She learns from Jote that their youngest sister Mjrn has run off to the nearby magicite mines. When Fran finds her and brings her back, Mjrn reveals she wishes to leave Golmore, but Fran advises her against doing so, relating how her own independence has cost her her family and the ability to commune with the Wood. Fran accepts that she is now part of the Hume world, and asks for a confirmation from Jote that the Wood accepts her before she leaves. Jote replies that The Wood misses her child and is jealous of the hume that has taken her away. Fran smiles {{for the first time in}} the game, knowing her sister is lying and still cares for her, as she leaves The Wood for good. In Revenant Wings, Balthier and Fran are searching for the Cache of Glabados. Fran was voiced by Nicole Fantl in English and by Rika Fukami in Japanese. She also appears in Itadaki Street Portable.|$|E

25|$|Compared to Landini's music, {{in which}} refinement, elegance, and a memorable melodic line were the clear {{goals of the}} composer, Andrea's music is dramatic, <b>restless,</b> <b>and</b> {{sometimes}} disjunct, and includes sharp dissonances to highlight certain passages in the text.
