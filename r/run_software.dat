2500|$|The 68000 has a 24-bit {{external}} {{address bus}} and two byte-select signals [...] "replaced" [...] A0. These 24 lines can therefore address 16 MB of physical memory with byte resolution. Address storage and computation uses 32 bits internally; however, the 8 high-order address bits are ignored due to the physical lack of device pins. This allows it to <b>run</b> <b>software</b> written for a logically flat 32-bit address space, while accessing only a 24-bit physical address space. [...] Motorola's intent with the internal 32-bit address space was forward compatibility, making it feasible to write 68000 software that would {{take full advantage of}} later 32-bit implementations of the 68000 instruction set.|$|E
2500|$|Within a year Microsoft {{licensed}} MS-DOS to over 70 other companies. It {{was designed}} to be an OS that could run on any 8086-family computer. Each computer would have its own distinct hardware and its own version of MS-DOS, similar to the situation that existed for CP/M, and with MS-DOS emulating the same solution as CP/M to adapt for different hardware platforms. To this end, MS-DOS was designed with a modular structure with internal device drivers, minimally for primary disk drives and the console, integrated with the kernel and loaded by the boot loader, and installable device drivers for other devices loaded and integrated at boot time. The OEM would use a development kit provided by Microsoft to build a version of MS-DOS with their basic I/O drivers and a standard Microsoft kernel, which they would typically supply on disk to end users along with the hardware. Thus, there were many different versions of [...] "MS-DOS" [...] for different hardware, and there is a major distinction between an IBM-compatible (or ISA) machine and an MS-DOS [...] machine. [...] Some machines, like the Tandy 2000, were MS-DOS compatible but not IBM-compatible, so they could <b>run</b> <b>software</b> written exclusively for MS-DOS without dependence on the peripheral hardware of the IBM PC architecture.|$|E
