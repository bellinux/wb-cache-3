From the early 1780s, Pussin had {{been in charge of}} the mental hospital division of the La Bicêtre, an asylum in Paris for male patients. From the mid-1780s, Pinel was publishing articles on links between emotions, social conditions and insanity. In 1792 (formally recorded in 1793), Pinel became the chief physician at the Bicetre. Pussin showed Pinel how <b>really</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> patients meant they could be managed with sympathy and kindness as well as authority and control. In 1797, Pussin first freed patients of their chains and banned physical punishment, although straitjackets could be used instead. Patients were allowed to move freely about the hospital grounds, and eventually dark dungeons were replaced with sunny, well-ventilated rooms. Pussin and Pinel's approach was seen as remarkably successful and they later brought similar reforms to a mental hospital in Paris for female patients, La Salpetrière. Pinel's student and successor, Jean Esquirol (1772-1840), went on to help establish 10 new mental hospitals that operated on the same principles. There was an emphasis on the selection and supervision of attendants in order to establish a suitable setting to facilitate psychological work, and particularly on the employment of ex-patients as they were thought most likely to refrain from inhumane treatment while being able to stand up to pleading, menaces, or complaining.|$|R

40|$|Protecting {{infrastructure}} from calamity {{has always}} been important for industry, government and society. Yet with more activities dependent on computer networks [...] from banking and aviation to emergency services [...] the reliability and security of information and communication systems against disasters, both natural and man-made, are in doubt. The question of protection is difficult {{because the majority of}} critical information infrastructure is privately-owned, interlinked with other firms, and crosses international borders. Evidence suggests there are currently insufficient incentives for protection to be adequately implemented. Companies internalize the costs and hope for the best; governments are loath to regulate lest they do it badly. Indeed, without <b>really</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> risk profile, it is not even clear what constitutes adequate protection in the first place. And, as always, it poses the question: who should pay? To understand the obstacles for protecting critical information infrastructure and to consider solutions, over 25 experts from industry, government and academia met for the fifth annual Conference on Information Law and Policy for the Information Economy, organized by Professors Lewis M. Branscomb and Viktor Mayer-Schönberger of Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, with the support of Swiss Re, from June 16 - 18, 2005 at the Swiss Re Center for Global Dialogue in Rueschlikon, Switzerland. The report that is meant not only as an analytical summary of the discussion, but also as a roadmap for future work. It is comprised of five sections. The first explains the problems of protecting critical information infrastructure, and the second section considers the economics of it. The third section examines different models of network security, and the fourth identifies roles for business, government and the insurance industry. The fifth section takes a practical turn, and proposes a series of next steps that the private and public sectors can take. The report concludes that global economic development may be the force that best addresses the problem. As society increasingly depends on critical information infrastructure, it is important for new forms of partnerships to develop, involving numerous stakeholders. As a first step, information-sharing requires a permissible legal framework, regarding both antitrust and liability concerns. Moreover, the introduction of insurance could provide a foundation for market-based risk analysis, and cooperation among infrastructure operators. The participants of the Rueschlikon conference were largely optimistic that provided market forces could be brought to bear on the issue of critical information infrastructure protection, many of today’s challenges could be alleviated. ...|$|R

The emergence of e-learning platforms as a result of the growing importance of lifelong learning and integrating them in the traditional educational environment was a crucial moment in the evolution of educational practices. Focusing on computer, Internet and intranets, e-learning brings education a surplus of interactivity, interaction, responsibility and collaborative learning.

40|$|Despite {{the growth}} the luxury {{industry}} has experienced in recent years, marketers are increasingly facing {{the emergence of}} a younger luxury consumer that has different values, priorities, and attitudes. Since these consumers are soon to replace the current luxury clientele as <b>the</b> primary luxury <b>consumer</b> due to their size and purchasing power, successful luxury brands have changed their strategies in order to stay relevant. Being faced with a considerable decrease in brand loyalty, {{a deeper understanding of the}} drivers of brand loyalty among this clientele is of utmost importance. Whereas loyalty has often simply been defined as repeat behavior of purchasing one single brand, the literature suggests a more complex definition, which emphasizes the importance of a favorable attitude toward the brand in order for a consumer to be considered truly loyal. Since this attitudinal part of brand loyalty does not necessarily presuppose actual brand usage, Gaggenau as a luxury appliance brand needs to find ways to attract and establish a pre-purchase bond with these consumers even before they have reached their peak buying power, which will create the basis for enduring brand loyalty. This thesis was set out to explore the complex process of loyalty creation in view of a different luxury consumer, which is increasingly gaining strategic importance. Focus of this thesis was to provide the luxury appliance brand Gaggenau with advice on how to create the basis for enduring brand loyalty among young Generation Y consumers. As a basis for the analysis, the term “luxury” including its different facets and the role aspirations play in the consumption motives for luxury goods has been investigated. This was followed by an examination of the important role of a new type of luxury consumer, characterized by different traits and attitudes. These consumers are likely members of the Generation Y cohort. Due to decreasing loyalty levels, particular emphasis has been put on understanding how to establish an enduring customer-brand relationship. For this, the formation of loyalty, including different degrees and types of loyalty, has been thoroughly investigated. The importance of truly <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer’s</b> values, desires, and preferences in the creation of brand commitment or in other words the attitudinal part of loyalty as an ultimate milestone to creating enduring brand loyalty, has also been pointed out. Therefore, the next step was to understand Generation Y <b>consumers.</b> <b>The</b> investigation has mainly focused on the opportunities for creating aspiration or an emotional bond with <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> at <b>the</b> early stage of <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> journey. Then, <b>the</b> specific challenges Gaggenau is facing with regard to this new luxury consumer and due to the difficulty of reconciling its status as luxury and appliance brand have been presented. The insights gained throughout this dissertation have then been summarized in a recommended course of action. Finally, based on the development of a Weighted Average Scoring Model for potential Gaggenau consumers, a selection of specific touch points has been evaluated on their effectiveness of creating the basis for enduring brand loyalty at the early stages of <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> journey...|$|R
