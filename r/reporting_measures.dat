40|$|Purpose – This paper 2 ̆ 7 s aim is {{to study}} multi-perspective {{strategic}} goal setting and performance reporting systems and investigate: if {{the strength of the}} alignment of the goals and performance measures is associated with organisational performance and if performance reporting emphasis (PRE) is associated with performance. Design/methodology/approach – Structured interviews with CEOs of 50 Australian companies with sales greater than 100 million per annum were conducted. Findings – The research identified 11 dimensions of PRE and 13 dimensions of organisational performance. The strength of the alignment of the strategic goals and the performance <b>reporting</b> <b>measures</b> was positively associated with organisational performance. PRE was positively associated with organisational performance. The alignment finding was the stronger of the two. Originality/value – The research identified several dimensions of performance reporting that organisations might consider using in their performance reporting systems.

Methods: A systematic search of the literature to identify studies eligible for inclusion and meta-analytical methods were applied. Meta-regression was used to identify potential covariates. Results: 8 studies <b>reporting</b> <b>measures</b> of resting HF-HRV in individuals with BN (n= 137) and controls (n= 190) were included. Random-effects meta-analysis revealed a sizeable main effect (Z= 2. 22, p=. 03; Hedge’s g= 0. 52, 95 %CI[0. 06; 0. 98]) indicating higher resting state vagal activity in individuals with BN.

Discussion: Findings suggest higher vagal activity in BN at rest, particularly in un-medicated samples with lower body mass index.

40|$|Abstract Background Distal radius {{fractures}} are common. The increasing {{prevalence of}} osteoporosis contributes to frequently complex articular injuries sustained even after low energy falls. The best method of treating complex type C distal radius fractures is debated. Locked volar plating and external fixation are both widely used with good <b>reported</b> results. <b>Measures</b> of success are traditionally based on technical measurements or {{the perception of}} the surgeon. Patient <b>reported</b> <b>measures</b> of outcome are increasingly recognised as important markers of surgical success. We report our experience using locked volar plating for complex type C distal radius fractures as well as patient <b>reported</b> <b>measures</b> of success and satisfaction. Methods Over a 12 month period we treated 21 patients with type C distal radius fractures using locked volar plating. These patients were followed up for at least 12 months and the outcome was assessed using clinical examination, grip strength measurements, radiographs and Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) scoring. Results The 21 patients studied had an average age of 48 years. There were 8 men and 13 women. All of the fractures had united by 3 months. There were no cases of wound infection or tendon injury/irritation. Patients reported low pain scores, good patient rated wrist evaluation scores and high levels of satisfaction. Conclusions Locked volar plating for complex distal radius fractures produces good results when assessed using patient <b>reported</b> <b>measures</b> of outcome. Further work should address whether locked volar plating offers superior outcomes and patient satisfaction compared to external fixation. </p...|$|R

METHODS A comprehensive meta-analysis of comparative studies <b>reporting</b> <b>measures</b> of depression, anxiety or emotional-subscales of quality of life (emoQoL) was performed. PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo and the Cochrane trial register databases were searched up to November 2011 (see Supplementary Data for PUBMED search string).

Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analysis of methodological and PCOS-related features were performed. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies (2384 patients and 2705 control women) were included. Higher emotional distress was consistently found for women with PCOS compared with control populations [main outcomes: depression: 26 studies, SMD 0. 60 (95...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{propensity}} score methods with survival or time-to-event outcomes: <b>reporting</b> <b>measures</b> of effect {{similar to those}} used in randomized experiments Peter C. Austina,b,c*† Propensity score methods are increasingly being used to estimate causal treatment effects in observational stud-ies. In medical and epidemiological studies, outcomes are frequently time-to-event in nature. Propensity-score methods are often applied incorrectly when estimating the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes. This article describes how two different {{propensity score}} methods (matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting) can be used to estimate the measures of effect that are frequently reported in randomized controlled trials: (i) marginal survival curves, which describe survival in the population if all subjects were treated or if all subjects were untreated; and (ii) marginal hazard ratios. The use of these propensity score methods allows one to replicate the measures of effect that are commonly reported in randomized controlled trials with time-to-event outcomes: both absolute and relative reductions in the probability of an event occurring can be determined.
