5|$|The main (west) facade has a {{projecting}} {{two and a}} half-story gable <b>roof</b> <b>section</b> that {{is three}} bays wide and two deep. Decorative detail on the exterior includes quoins, the James Gibbs-inspired surround on the main entrance, and the molded surrounds and keystones of the casement windows. In {{the northwest corner of}} the intersection between the building's two sections is a one-story-high, one-bay-square addition with a narrow metal casement window on the west facade and a large double entrance for horses on the north. The building's interior consists of a large riding ring that is open to the rafters, and in the gable-roofed section, there are lockers and changing rooms on the first floor and a multi-purpose room on the second; on one of its walls is a floor-to-ceiling window permitting view of the ring activity below.|$|E
25|$|On 5 February 2009, a bus {{en route}} from Abbey Street to Artane {{collided}} with a tree on North Strand Road and the entire <b>roof</b> <b>section</b> was torn off. The driver was treated in hospital for shock but apart from {{that there were no}} injuries as no passengers were seated in the upper deck. The bus was an Alexander ALX400.|$|E
25|$|St Edward's Crown was {{initially}} used on kiosks {{in all parts}} of the United Kingdom. However, from 1955, in Scotland, the Post Office opted to use a representation of the actual Crown of Scotland, in line with a wider policy for government agencies in Scotland. To accommodate the two different designs of crown on K6 kiosks, the fascia sections were henceforth cast with a slot in them, into which a plate bearing the appropriate crown was inserted before the <b>roof</b> <b>section</b> was fitted.|$|E
50|$|The roof {{is made of}} {{aluminum}} and {{is made up of}} three separate sections. The fan grills and roof slope area belong to the <b>roof</b> <b>sections,</b> and can be removed as part of the roof, making the entire width of the body available for work on the machinery inside. The <b>roof</b> <b>sections</b> are resting on the side panels, their connecting belts, and the fixed roofs of the driver's cabs, and a floating seal is built into the <b>sections.</b> The <b>roof</b> <b>sections</b> are completely flat for aerodynamic reasons, {{with the exception of the}} pantographs, the signal horns, and the antenna for radio communication.|$|R

50|$|The Pierrepont Union Church is a {{one story}} wood frame Queen Anne style {{building}} with two main gable <b>roofed</b> <b>sections</b> {{built in the}} mid-1880s.|$|R
25|$|The Eagles {{were popular}} (particularly in the snowbelt), had towing capacity, {{and came in}} several {{equipment}} levels including sport and luxury trims. Two additional models were added in 1981, the sub-compact SX/4 and Kammback. A manual transmission and a front axle-disconnect feature were also made available for greater fuel economy. During 1981 and 1982 a unique convertible {{was added to the}} line. The Eagle's monocoque body was reinforced for the conversion and had a steel targa bar with a removable fiberglass <b>roof</b> <b>section.</b> The Eagle station wagon remained in production for one model year after Chrysler acquired AMC in 1987.|$|E
25|$|The two five-storey {{buildings}} photographed for {{the album}} cover are located at 96 and 98 St. Mark's Place in New York City. The original photograph underwent {{a number of}} tweaks {{to arrive at the}} final image. The fifth floor of the building had to be cropped out to fit the square album cover format. The buildings to the left and right were also changed to match the style of the double front. Tiles were added on the <b>roof</b> <b>section</b> along with more faces. Part of the top right railing balcony was left out for a whole window frame to be visible. The front cover is a daytime shot, while the back cover was taken at night.|$|E
25|$|Depending on location, various safe-haven {{areas have}} been prepared. The goal has been to avoid outer walls which might {{collapse}} when a <b>roof</b> <b>section</b> becomes airborne and the walls below lose their upper support: many interior rooms resist collapse longer, due to smaller walls interconnected to each other, while outer walls deflect {{the force of the}} winds. Because mobile homes typically lack foundation anchors and present a large surface-area sail (to catch wind), the advice has been to seek a safe haven elsewhere, such as in a stronger nearby building. When a mobile home begins to roll, people have been injured by hitting objects inside, or being crushed when a trailer suddenly hits the ground and begins to collapse around them.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason why}} the gable roof is so common is the simple design of the roof timbers and the {{rectangular}} shape of the <b>roof</b> <b>sections.</b> This avoids details which require {{a great deal of}} work or cost and which are prone to damage. If the pitch or the rafter lengths of the two <b>roof</b> <b>sections</b> are different, it is described as an 'asymmetrical gable roof'. A gable roof on a church tower (gable tower) is usually called a 'cheese wedge roof' (Käsbissendach) in Switzerland.|$|R
50|$|Warm, dry air will be {{circulated}} {{in the gap}} between inner and outer <b>roof</b> <b>sections</b> {{in order to prevent}} corrosion and to stop drops of condensation falling into the interior.|$|R
50|$|In 1945, the {{carriage}} works began constructing all-steel carriages, both electric and steam hauled. It pioneered {{the use of}} plastics and glass fibre reinforced resin for doors, seating and <b>roof</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{convertible}} roof is fully automatic — an unusual feature {{in such a}} small car — and can be opened partially {{to act as a}} sunroof whilst the car is driving at speed. The convertible model forsakes the rear hatchback of the Hardtop Mini, replacing it with a drop down 'tailgate' that is reminiscent of the classic Mini — it incorporates similarly prominent external hinges, and with the roof in the closed position, the rear <b>roof</b> <b>section</b> and luggage shelf can be raised with two handles, semi-tailgate style, to access the luggage space easier. The convertible also adds two small power windows for the rear seat passengers which are lowered automatically when the roof opens. The roof is made from a heavy cloth, with many layers of insulation; the rear window is glass with an integral heater/defroster, but no washer or wiper.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{location of}} the living accommodation in part of the Deele explains the very unusual layout of the Low German house. Whilst other 'all-in-one' farmhouses have their living quarters at the front, the Low German house across most of its native region has its main gateway at the front. The large gateway gable (colloquially: Grotdörgiebel) was very carefully made. The frame and especially the lintel of the Grote Dör (great door) were adorned with inscriptions and decorations. On simple houses the gable above is just filled in with vertical timber laths; on more complicated buildings the timber-framing of the steep gable extends almost to the roof ridge. In the Altes Land projecting gables are preferred. In Schaumburg Land and the area around Hanover the gable is topped by a <b>roof</b> <b>section</b> sloping at about 80°.|$|E
500|$|Raised {{above the}} main deck, the cockpit creates a hump. The raised cockpit allows front loading of cargo on freight variants. The upper deck behind the cockpit {{provides}} {{space for a}} lounge or extra seating. The [...] "stretched upper deck" [...] became available as an option on the 747-100B variant and later as standard beginning on the 747-300. The upper deck was stretched more on the 747-8. [...] The 747 cockpit <b>roof</b> <b>section</b> also has an escape hatch from which crew can exit {{in the event of}} an emergency if they cannot exit through the cabin.|$|E
50|$|The totalisator is a timber framed {{building}} clad with weatherboard and fibro set {{behind and}} {{to one side}} of the grandstand and can be clearly recognised from early photographs. It is a narrow T-shape in plan, with a two storey hip <b>roofed</b> <b>section</b> set at right angles to a single storey gable <b>roofed</b> <b>section.</b> The <b>roofs</b> of both are clad with corrugated iron of the same profile as the grandstand and the hipped roof retains finials at each end of its ridge pole, though the flagpole at the end of the single storey gable has gone.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} a one story frame {{structure}} with vertical tongue and groove siding below the window sills and horizontal clapboard siding above. The <b>roof</b> <b>sections</b> are gabled, all windows have pointed arches.|$|R

2500|$|T-top: A {{derivative}} of the Targa top, called a T-bar roof, this fixed-roof design has two removable panels and retains a central narrow <b>roof</b> <b>section</b> {{along the front}} to back axis of the car (e.g. Toyota MR2 Mark I.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The ratha is {{reminiscent}} of Buddhist cave architecture, such as Sala-Shikhara. Archaeologist, however, are {{of the opinion that}} the stupa suggests a shikhara (temple tower) style; there are twelve such styles depicted in all the rathas experimented by sculptors during the Pallvava period. It is also mentioned that it has palace architectural style considering its barrel vaulting and long columned porch. The <b>roof</b> <b>section</b> resembles a boat. The Bhima Ratha has a pillared open veranda, a column with a Pallava seated lion, and [...] "horseshoe-arch dormer like projections" [...] called kudus. These decorations are carved on the external faces of the ratha, above the cornices which also forms the dividing line between the ground floor and {{the first floor of the}} structure. Oblong-shaped shrines are carved at the cornices linked with a passage. The small shrines have a wagon-type roof supported on lion mounted pillars. The ends of the gables have fine decorative motifs, with a miniature model of a square at the centre. The niches seen are carved with regular spacing and are supported on two pilasters. Nasikas are mentioned in inscriptions inside the temple.|$|E
2500|$|Paxton's roofing system {{incorporated}} his elegant {{solution to}} the problem of draining the building's vast roof area. Like the Chatsworth Lily House (but unlike its later incarnation at Sydnenham) most of the roof of the original Hyde Park structure had a horizontal profile, so heavy rain posed a potentially serious safety hazard. Because normal cast glass is brittle and has low tensile strength, there was a risk that the weight of any excess water build-up on the roof might have caused panes to shatter, showering shards of glass onto the patrons, ruining the valuable exhibits beneath, and weakening the structure. However, Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof was designed to shed water very efficiently. Rain ran off the angled glass roof panes into U-shaped cast-iron channels which ran the length of each <b>roof</b> <b>section</b> at the bottom of the 'furrow'. These channels were ingeniously multifunctional - during construction, they served as the rails that supported and guided the trolleys on which the glaziers sat as they installed the roofing. Once completed, the channels acted both as the joists that supported the roof sections, and as guttering - a patented design now widely known as a [...] "Paxton gutter". These gutters conducted the rainwater to the ends of each furrow, where they emptied into the larger main gutters, which were set at right angles to the smaller gutters, along the top of the main horizontal roof bearers. These main gutters drained at either end into the cast iron pillars, which also had an ingenious dual function - each was cast with a hollow core, allowing it to double as a concealed down-pipe that carried the storm-water down into the drains beneath the building.|$|E

50|$|The {{open deck}} {{in an open}} top bus may have the roof {{partially}} or fully removed, with a guard rail. An intact <b>roof</b> <b>section</b> may be left at the front or rear, and the full/half window height may remain in the open sections. Some open top buses have a re-fittable <b>roof</b> <b>section,</b> for fitting in inclement weather. Some may also have weather-proof upper deck seats.|$|E
50|$|Between 1985 and 1987, a minor {{renovation}} of the train shed took place, where the middle wooden <b>roofing</b> <b>section</b> was replaced with glass. The lighting was replaced and the metal parts of the shed were painted.|$|R
50|$|The Hedlund Motor Company Building is a {{historic}} commercial building located at 206 S. Main St. in Elk City, Oklahoma. The building was constructed in 1918 for the Hedlund Motor Company; founded in 1913, the company was Oklahoma's second-oldest Ford dealership. The Mission Revival building is the only commercial structure in Elk City which uses the style. The building features stucco walls inlaid with clay tiles along the second floor and at the corners and centers of the main facades. Two tiled <b>roof</b> <b>sections</b> project from each facade; the <b>roof</b> <b>sections</b> are lined with brackets on their undersides. Curved parapets run along the roof line of both facades.|$|R

5000|$|The 1939 Model A {{featured}} a retractable <b>roof</b> <b>section</b> {{at the very}} back of the greenhouse, distinctive stylized headlight lenses, and unusual open-sided front fenders. The rear <b>roof</b> <b>section</b> could be opened if passengers desired an open-air ride. The open-sided fenders in front detracted from the car's styling but made fender repairs easier for fleet owners. Beginning in 1939, Checkers were powered by the well-known Continental [...] "Red Seal" [...] inline six-cylinder engine, until the engine was discontinued in 1964. Starting in the 1950s, Checker offered an optional overhead valve version of the Continental six.|$|E
50|$|A {{retractable}} hardtop (also {{known as}} coupé convertible or coupé cabriolet) {{is a type}} of convertible that forgoes a folding textile roof in favor of an automatically operated, multi-part, self-storing roof where the rigid <b>roof</b> <b>sections</b> are opaque, translucent, or independently operable.|$|R
50|$|Ruddle's Building is a two-storeyed {{rendered}} masonry {{structure with}} three parallel corrugated iron hipped <b>roof</b> <b>sections</b> concealed behind a parapet.
