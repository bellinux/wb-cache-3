500|$|... "Love Story" [...] was {{recorded}} in March 2008 at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, alongside record producer Nathan Chapman and various personnel. Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube microphone, manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a [...] "try this for a while" [...] experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, {{he had not been}} able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone. [...] "When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' She had no idea what it was, just loved it, and I went along with something that felt <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> We've been using it ever since, and it sounds great on her voice," [...] Chapman said.|$|E

She goes to her uncle, Doctor Dake, for {{something}} to make her tail grow. He tries to tell her that her tail is just <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> species, but she throws a tantrum. He gives in and he tells her where she can find berries that will make her tail grow. The first berry makes her tail exactly like Lolla Lee Lou's, but greed overtakes her. Now wanting to surpass Lolla Lee Lou, she eats the entire vine, causing her tail to grow to an enormous size. However, the added weight of too many feathers does not allow her to fly, run or even walk. She panics by yelping repeatedly, while being stuck on the hill. Her uncle, who hears her painful yelps, sends for the rescue, and many other birds are forced to carry her home and pluck out her tail feathers, which takes a few weeks, causing her to be sore. Though she has only one feather left—as before—she now has [...] "enough, because now she is smarter." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Craig Crawford, in {{his book}} The Politics of Life: 25 Rules for Survival in a Brutal and Manipulative World (2007), {{describes}} Cher as [...] "a model of flexible career management", and relates her career successes to a constant reshaping of her image according to the evolving trends of popular culture. He further explains that she billed [...] "each dramatic turnaround of style as another example of rebellion—an image that allowed her to make calculated changes while appearing to be consistent." [...] Author Grant McCracken stated, [...] "The term 'reinvention' is now often {{used to talk about}} the careers of American celebrities. But in Cher's case, it is particularly apt [...] is inclined to lock on to each new fashion wave [...] is swept violently down the diffusion stream and out of fashion. Only substantial re-creation permits her to return to stardom." [...] Her [...] "integrity" [...] and [...] "perseverance" [...] are highlighted in the Reaching Your Goals book series of illustrated inspirational stories for children, in which her life is detailed emphasizing the importance of self-actualization: [...] "For years, Cher worked hard to become a successful singer. Then she worked hard to become an actress. Even when she needed money, she turned down movie roles that weren't <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> Her goal has always been to be a good actress, not just a rich and famous one." ...|$|E
500|$|... "There's Something About Marrying" [...] was {{met with}} {{positive}} reception as well, particularly from gay rights groups. The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) was welcoming of the episode, calling it [...] "a ray of light". GLAAD executive director Joan Garry enjoyed seeing Marge's transformation, from having ambivalent feelings for her sister to then supporting her. He commented that [...] "when Marge learns that Patty's about to marry someone who isn't really a lesbian, she comes to realize that what her sister really deserves {{is to be in}} love with and married to a person who's <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> If millions of Simpsons viewers came away from last night's episode with that little bit of moral truth, it was time well spent." [...] AfterEllen.com's David Kennerley approved of the willingness of a [...] "hit network TV show in prime time, watched by children and adults" [...] to [...] "serve up such a politically charged issue". Rick Garcia, an activist of the gay rights group Equality Illinois, said to the Chicago Tribune that the episode would likely affect society in a positive way because of the iconic status of the show which [...] "shape our attitudes". Unlike many of the conservative groups, Kennerley noted that [...] "in the show's tradition of equal-opportunity lampooning, the message is not all pro-gay. Irksome lesbian stereotypes abound, and Nelson the bully suggests they 'legalize gay funerals.' And naturally, Reverend Lovejoy shutters his church to the same-sex sinners." [...] According to Simpsons writer Mike Reiss, the episode also had supporters among conservative groups. He told Encore magazine that [...] "gay people came out very much in favor of it and were happy with the episode, but arch conservatives and right-wing Christians loved the episode, too, because they seemed to think we were making fun of gay people. We really had it both ways." ...|$|E

She {{went on to say}} that Mercedes [...] "always looks after her family and would never do anything to deliberately hurt them. Mercedes' heart is definitely in the right place". Metcalfe observed that Mercedes is [...] "completely mad" [...] and she [...] "just does whatever she feels like doing at the time. She doesn't exactly think things through". Metcalfe further explained that Mercedes did not [...] "consider consequences", which led her to unintentionally [...] "destroy everything". She elaborated on this, saying that Mercedes never has a happy ending [...] "because she can't. I don't think with Mercedes there is ever a happy ending. Just when something might go her way or something's going to go <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> she destroys it". She said that her character is [...] "used to getting her own way" [...] so she thought that despite her actions, [...] "everything will turn out right in the end". She opined that Mercedes was at her best in this state, being [...] "minxy and destructive". Metcalfe described Mercedes in this way: [...] "Whatever she does that's bad, she manages to justify in her head. She doesn't have much self-worth and she knows what she's like". Metcalfe also expressed the hope that Mercedes could be happy [...] "free and single". She explained that Mercedes was unable to remain happy, saying: [...] "she has moments of happiness but ruins them herself". She went on to explain that due to Mercedes' first love having [...] "messed her up", Mercedes behaved [...] "the way she is where men are concerned". She further explained that Mercedes believed she could change but was disappointed when she could not. Metcalfe said, [...] "When she says that she's going to change, she actually means it; she just can't sustain it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Matrix {{commented that}} after they {{presented}} songs to Spears, she tailored them to suit herself, especially the lyrics. Christy said, [...] "... she {{really knows what}} she wants. She knows if she's trying something on that doesn't fit <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She's like, 'No, that's not me.' She's not one to strap {{on some sort of}} fake image." [...] Christy also claimed to be impressed with Spears's vocal ability during the recording of [...] "Shadow". Steve Anderson, Lisa Greene and Stephen Lee wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] at Metrophonic Studios in London, England. Before meeting with the other writers, Anderson thought of two concepts for songs specifically for Spears: one he had worked on [...] "for ages", and [...] "Breathe on Me", which he drafted {{on the morning of the}} sessions. Greene and Lee did not like the first concept, and they wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] with Anderson. The song was produced by Mark Taylor, who kept most of the programming done by Anderson. With Taylor, Spears recorded [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "And Then We Kiss", which did not make the album. Before the album was released, Spears's manager Larry Rudolph commented that it was important for Spears to continue moving away from a traditional pop sound, citing [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] and [...] "Boys" [...] from Britney as departures from her previous music. Barry Weiss, then-president of Jive Label Group, added, [...] "She has achieved what she set out to achieve, which was to make a mature album that didn't sound like something she would have done three years while still making a commercial album that has hit singles. [...] It's the kind of record she should be doing right now, and it came down to her to make it." [...] In the Zone was recorded at Battery Studios and The Dojo in New York City, 3:20 Studios, Decoy Studios, Pacifique Studios, Record Plant in Los Angeles, California, Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California, The Chocolate Factory, in Chicago, Illinois, Triangle Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, Metrophonic Studios and Olympic Studios in London, England, and Murlyn Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Throughout the beginning of 2003, Spears started testing tracks by playing them in nightclubs such as Show in New York City.|$|E

[...] During the relationship Thomson had paid off Vine's debts of £20,000, and Vine said she married him because this had been a condition of his funding her: [...] "I couldn't face stripping any more and it was too bloody good to turn down."

Vance was slated to make her return to Broadway in the Woody Allen comedy Don't Drink the Water. However, she left the play during its out-of-town tryouts, later saying she felt the role was not <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and asking the show's producers to be let out of her contract.
