40|$|Industrial loads {{are mostly}} {{inductive}} and hence operate at low power factor. Several methods including {{the installation of}} capacitor banks are available for improving power factor {{in order to reduce}} the kilovolt ampere (kVA) demand of the load and power loss from the power supply system. However, literatures have shown that improvement of power factor has effect on switching transients which is dangerous for industrial loads and operating personnel. In this work, we investigated the effect of improving the power factor of a power system beyond 0. 8 (lagging) on switching transient levels using FUMMAN industry power network as a case study. A power factor measuring tool was modelled using the mathematical relation between power factor, reactive power and active power. The modelled equations were simulated Matlab/Simulink software (Version 7. 9. 0. 529 ‘R 2009 b’). The characteristics of the system under study namely root mean square (<b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s)</b> <b>voltage,</b> peak steady state voltage, peak transient voltage and kVA demand were measured during the simulation with and without parallel connection of capacitor bank across the system. The result from the analysis showed that FUMMAN industry power network was operating at a lagging power factor of 0. 8 with <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s</b> <b>voltage</b> of 412. 1 V, peak steady state voltage of 582. 8 V, peak transient voltage of 701. 9 V and kVA demand of 1878 kVA without the capacitor bank. However, when a capacitor bank was connected across the system and the power factor increased from 0. 8 (lagging) to 0. 9098 (lagging), optimised performance of the system was obtained with a capacitor bank size of 440 kVar. At lagging power factor of 0. 9098, the kVA demand of the system was 1650 kVA, <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s</b> <b>voltage</b> was 415. 5 V and peak transient voltage was 749. 5 V. The analysis therefore showed that increasing power factor beyond 0. 8 (lagging) using capacitor banks though improves the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s</b> <b>voltage</b> and reduces the power loss but invariably leads to increase in switching transients which is undesired for optimised system performance...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{need for}} {{ensuring}} good power quality (PQ) cannot be over-emphasized in {{electrical power system}} operation and management. PQ problem is associated with any electrical distribution and utilization system that experiences any voltage, current or frequency deviation from normal operation. In the current power and energy scenario, voltage-related PQ disturbances like voltage dips are a fact which cannot be eliminated from electrical power systems since electrical faults, and disturbances are stochastic in nature. Voltage dip tends to lead to malfunction or shut down of costly and mandatory equipment and appliances in consumers’ systems causing significant financial losses for domestic, commercial and industrial consumers. It accounts for the disruption of both the performance and operation of sensitive electrical and electronic equipment, which reduces the efficiency and the productivity of power utilities and consumers across the globe. Voltage dips are usually experienced {{as a result of}} short duration reduction in the r. m. s. (r. m. s. - root mean square) value of the declared or nominal voltage at the power frequency and is usually followed by recovery of the voltage dip after few seconds. The IEEE recommended practice for monitoring electric power quality (IEEE Std. 1159 - 2009, revised version of June 2009), provides definitions to label an <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>voltage</b> disturbance based upon its duration and voltage magnitude. These disturbances can be classified into transient events such as voltage dips, swells and spikes. Other long duration <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>voltage</b> variations are mains failures, interruption, harmonic voltage distortion and steady-state overvoltages and undervoltages. This PhD research work deals with voltage dip phenomena only. Initially, the present power network was not designed to accommodate renewable distributed generation (RDG) units. The advent and deployment of RDG over recent years and high penetration of RDG has made the power network more complex and vulnerable to PQ disturbances. It is a well-known fact that the degree of newly introduced RDG has increased rapidly and growing further because of several reasons, which include the need to reduce environmental pollution and global warming caused by emission of carbon particles and greenhouse gases, alleviating transmission congestion and loss reduction. RDG ancillary services support especially voltage and reactive power support in electricity networks are currently being recognized, researched and found to be quite useful in voltage dip mitigation...|$|E

To use High-Tc superconductors for current transportation, {{it is important to}} evaluate and to measure their losses. Under the assumption that the superconductor is only exposed to its self-field, Bean's model is used to compute these losses. This work deals with the losses in a cylindrical High-Tc superconductor current-lead. It is made of compacted composite of Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O- 2223, the value of its critical current is about 100 A (measured with I /spl mu/V/cm criteria). Two types of measuring methods are used. The first of them uses a differential amplifier associated with a computer, which calculate the instantaneous power by numerical integration. The second series of experiments, valid only with sinusoidal current, are made using a lock-in amplifier measuring the <b>R.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>voltage.</b> The value of transport current is high enough to be compatible with applications. Both methods give nearly the same results for sinusoidal signal. Measurements are made with non-sinusoidal current, to do that the superconductor sample is fed by a dimmer switch. The experiments show that the losses are essentially a function of the maximum value of the current, not of the firing angle. We conclude that the shape of the current is not important compared to its peak value...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} complexity {{in the power}} system, voltage sags and swells are now {{becoming one of the}} most significant power quality problems. Voltage sag is a short reduction voltage from nominal voltage, occurs in a short time, voltage swell is an increase in the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s</b> <b>voltage</b> from its nominal voltage; they are bound to have a greater impact on the industrial customers. If the voltage sags exceed two to three cycles, then manufacturing systems making use of sensitive electronic equipments are likely to be affected leading to major problems. It ultimately leads to wastage of resources (both material and human) as well as financial losses. The increasing competition in the market and the declining profits has made it pertinent for the industries to realize the significance of high-power quality. This is possible only by ensuring that uninterrupted flow of power is maintained at proper voltage levels. Electric utilities are looking for solutions to ensure high quality power supply to their customers, a lot of solutions have been developed, but this project tends look at the solving the problems by using custom power devices such as Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) and Distribution Static compensator (D-STATCOM). The Dynamic Voltage Restorer appears to be an especially good solution in the current scenario. This work describes the techniques of correcting the supply voltage sag and voltage swell in a distributed system. At present, a wide range of very flexible controllers, which capitalize on newly available power electronics components, are emerging for custom power applications. Among these, the distribution static compensator and the dynamic voltage restorer are most effective devices, both of them based on the VSC principle. A DVR injects a voltage in series with the system voltage and a DSTATCOM injects a current into the system to correct the voltage sag, swell and interruption. Comprehensive results are presented to assess the performance of each device as a potential custom power solution...|$|E

40|$|Surface {{granular}} flow, comprising {{granular material}} flowing {{on the surface}} of a heap of the same material, occurs in several industrial and natural systems. The rheology of such a flow was investigated by means of measurements of velocity and number-density profiles in a quasi-two-dimensional rotating cylinder, half-filled with a model granular material - monosize spherical stainless-steel particles. The measurements were made at the Centre of the cylinder, where the flow is fully developed, using streakline photography and image analysis. The stress profile was computed from the number-density profile using a force balance which takes into account wall friction. Mean-velocity and root-mean-square (<b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.)</b> -velocity profiles are reported for different particle sizes and cylinder rotation speeds. The profiles for the mean velocity superimpose when distance is scaled by the particle diameter d and velocity by a characteristic shear rate gamma(C) = [g sin(beta(m) - beta(s)) /d cos beta(s) ] 1 / 2 and the particle diameter, where beta(m) is the maximum dynamic angle of repose and beta(s) is the static angle of repose. The maximum dynamic angle of repose is found to vary with the local flow rate. The scaling is also found to work for the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity profiles. The mean velocity is found to decay exponentially with depth in the bed, with decay length lambda = 1. 1 d. The <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity shows similar behaviour but with lambda = 1. 7 d. The <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity profile shows two regimes: near the free surface the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity is nearly constant and below a transition point it decays linearly with depth. The shear rate, obtained by numerical differentiation of the velocity profile, is not constant anywhere in the layer and has a maximum which occurs at the same depth as the transition in the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity profile. Above the transition point the velocity distributions are Gaussian and below the transition point the velocity distributions gradually approach a Poisson distribution. The shear stress increases roughly linearly with depth. The variation in the apparent viscosity eta with <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity u shows a relatively sharp transition at the shear-rate maximum, and in the region below this point the apparent viscosity eta similar to u(- 1. 5). The measurements indicate that the flow comprises two layers: an upper low-viscosity layer with a nearly constant <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity and a lower layer of increasing viscosity with a decreasing <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity. The thickness of the upper layer depends on the local flow rate and is independent of particle diameter while the reverse is found to hold for the lower-layer thickness. The experimental data is compared with the predictions of three models for granular flow...|$|R

Coupled with the available sub- 10 fs optical pulses, investigations into few-femtosecond dynamics are not far off.
