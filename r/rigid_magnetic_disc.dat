50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the air-bearing head was to allow the device to have rapid random access ability to any storage location.

The primary storage technology used for digital information has remained constant {{over the last two}} decades, {{in the form of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>disc.</b> Consequently, investigative, forensic, and judicial procedures are well-established for <b>magnetic</b> <b>disc</b> storage devices (Carrier, 2005).

40|$|A soft/hard Fe/FePt bilayer with {{perpendicular}} magnetization was prepared on a glass substrate. Controlling the Fe layer thickness allowed {{modification of the}} hysteresis loops from rigid magnet with {{perpendicular magnetization}} to exchange-spring like magnet with parallel magnetization due to the nanoscale soft/hard interface coupling. For <b>rigid</b> <b>magnetic</b> films, the magnetization was reversed at a single switching field and interpreted by the two-spin model. In an exchange-spring like film, the in-plane magnetization reversal process was in two-steps and resulted from domain wall nucleation and propagation from the Fe layer into the FePt layer...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{continuum}} theory describing {{the evolution of}} magnetization and temperature in a <b>rigid</b> <b>magnetic</b> body. The theory {{is based on a}} microforce balance, an energy balance, and an entropy imbalance. We advance the choice of a class of constitutive equations, consistent with the entropy imbalance, that appear appropriate to describe the phase transition taking place in a ferromagnet at the Curie point. By combining these constitutive equations with the balance laws, we formulate an initial-boundary value problem for the magnetization and temperature fields, and we prove existence of weak solutions...|$|R

The proper generalization of Taylor expansions to stochastic calculus gives suitable time integration schemes. For a single <b>rigid</b> <b>magnetic</b> moment the thermal equilibrium properties are investigated. It is found, that the Heun scheme is a good compromise between numerical stability an...|$|R

25|$|Responsibility {{lies with}} the BuOrd, which {{specified}} an unrealistically <b>rigid</b> <b>magnetic</b> exploder sensitivity setting and oversaw the feeble testing program. Its pitiful budget did not permit live fire tests against real targets; instead, any torpedo that ran under the target was presumed to be a hit due to the magnetic influence exploder, which was never actually tested. Therefore, additional responsibility must also be assigned to the United States Congress, which cut critical funding to the Navy during the interwar years, and to NTS, which inadequately performed the very few tests made. BuOrd failed to assign a second naval facility for testing, and failed to give Newport adequate direction.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Colloid and Interface Science and the definitive published version is available at [URL] 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc. Hypothesis: Reducing particle contaminations on solid and delicate surfaces is of great importance {{in a number of}} industries. A new non-destructive method is proposed, which is based on the laser-induced thermocapillary effect for the removal of micron size particles from surfaces. The cleaning mechanism is related to the surface-tension-driven flows produced by the laser heating of thin layer of a cleaning liquid deposited onto a surface contaminated with particles. Experiments: Focusing the laser irradiation into the line laser beam allowed using this method for a large-scale cleaning of surfaces. Hexadecane was used as a cleaning liquid to remove micron-sized polyethylene, Teflon, talc and Al 2 O 3 particles from surfaces of welding glass, carbolite and soft <b>magnetic</b> <b>disc</b> using the line beam of the IR laser. Findings: A good cleaning efficiency was achieved for cases of polyethylene and Teflon particles on both the complete wettable welding glass and the low-wettable soft <b>magnetic</b> <b>disc,</b> while in case of oleophilic talc and Al 2 O 3 particles the effectiveness of the cleaning method was lower on all three substrates investigated. The thermal influence of the laser irradiation on substrates used was measured with infrared camera. It was shown that temperature in the irradiated area during the long-time heating increases insignificantly and cannot cause any damage of the substrate...|$|R
40|$|The pressure, {{flow rate}} and power {{characteristics}} of disks type electromagnetic induction pump on rotating permanent magnets (PMP) have been measured on In-Ga-Sn loop for different gaps between magnetic disks. Gained experimental data base {{is very important}} for design and evaluation of parameters of disk type PMP as theoretical calculations of parameters of such type of PMP is very difficult task due to non-uniform distribution of magnetic field and, consequently, of induced electromagnetic forces in radial direction. Along the radial direction also other important governing parameters defining the efficiency of pump (such as pole pith length and velocity of generated alternating traveling magnetic field) have non-uniform distribution. Magnetic field distribution between poles for different gaps between <b>magnetic</b> <b>discs</b> was measured. From experimentally measured pressure, flow rate and power characteristics (heat losses in liquid metal layer in the channel of pump and in electrically conducting walls of the channel of pump made from stainless steel) the averaged value of effective magnetic field was determined, which is the main parameter defining the efficiency of pump used at first order evaluation of PMP parameters. The results of measured efficiency of the pump depending on the distance between <b>magnetic</b> <b>discs</b> are very important at practice allowing to choose the gap between discs (which can be varied) to ensure needed protection of permanent magnets from heat radiation depending on the operating temperature of liquid metal in the channel of pump...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of powder neutron {{scattering}} measurements on the magnetic correlations in the frustrated antiferromagnet Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12. A {{clear view of the}} short-range magnetic order has been obtained for a temperature range 0. 14 - 5 EC. At T similar to 0. 14 K there is a partial transition to a phase with a much longer correlation length. We argue that the low-temperature phase is not an ordinary spin glass, as was suggested by bulk properties measurements, but rather a mixture of a spin-liquid state with a set of <b>rigid</b> <b>magnetic</b> pieces nucleated around impurity centers. The experimental data are compared with {{the results of}} Monte Carlo simulations performed for several models...|$|R

5000|$|In March 1967 Ampex {{introduced}} the HS-100 video disc recorder. The system {{was developed by}} Ampex {{at the request of}} the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) for a variety of sports broadcast uses. It was first demonstrated on the air on March 18, 1967, when “ABC’s Wide World of Sports” televised the “World Series of Skiing” from Vail, Colorado.http://www.digitrakcom.com/literature/HS-100%20Press.pdf The video was recorded on analog <b>magnetic</b> <b>disc.</b> The disc weighed 5 pounds/2.3 kg and rotated at 60rps, 3600rpm (50rps in Pal). One NTSC unit could record 30 seconds of video, PAL units 36 seconds. The video could then be played back in slow motion, stop action to freeze frame.http://www.vtoldboys.com/slomo_3.htm A more deluxe version, the HS-200, was introduced around 1971, and provided a large control console with variable speed playback. This made it ideal for instant replay for sports events and precise timing control in post production service. CBS-TV was the first to use the technique during live sportscasts, though it was quickly adopted by all American TV networks. The HS-200, which was an HS-100 connected to a control console when combined called the HS-200, had greater precise frame and timing control capability, lending itself to post-production applications like special effects and titles. The HS-200 had a frame accurate timing computer that enabled frame-accurate cuts and dissolve transitions by way of a two-input video switcher. Slow-motion sequences could likewise be programmed and could be [...] "triggered" [...] to begin via an external control pulse such as might come from an external VTR editor like the Ampex VR-2000 VTR with Editec. The HS-200 was the first system capable of single-frame video animation recording, using <b>magnetic</b> <b>discs</b> as opposed to videotape. The HS-200 also provided a readout with specific frame numbers showing from the 900 frames available (NTSC version.) Sequences could be triggered to start from any of these 900 frames with frame-accurate repeatability for creative fine tuning of sequence start and end points.|$|R

The magnetisation reversal of the discs was analysed on a time-scale of an hour as well as a few milliseconds to asses their suitability for magnetic particle imaging. We conclude that compared to FeraSpin particles, these microfabricated particles saturate in fields as low as 12 mT, the shape of the hysteresis loop is relatively independent of the field sweep rate, and the difference in phase between higher harmonics is constant up to the 20 th harmonic. These radically different magnetic properties suggest that microfabricated particles might have advantages for applications such as magnetic particle imaging...|$|R
