5|$|At the school, the {{fatalities}} {{resulted from}} {{the collapse of a}} concrete block wall. One hallway completely collapsed, trapping many students in the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hallway known as 3rd Hall. The tornado at the school was so strong that it tossed and mangled cars in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, an unseasonable {{electrical}} {{storm and}} flash flood tore out the Rubio Pavilion and buried {{one of the}} caretakers’ children in the mud. The injured parents spent years in the hospital recuperating from the devastation that left them trapped in the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pavilion. Three of the children, {{who knew how to}} move the incline cars, escaped {{to the top of the}} incline.|$|E
25|$|The {{sculpture}} of The Mount of Olives {{was destroyed in}} the great fire of 1689 and left in ruins after the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cloister was removed in 1820 {{in order to create}} some open space. Later it was fitted with a roof to prevent further deterioration. The sculptures were supplemented by the Speyer sculptor, Gottfried Renn. Inside the mount is a chapel dedicated to the Archangel Michael.|$|E

50|$|From 28 May to 6 June 1940, French {{troops were}} engaged in {{defending}} the town against <b>the</b> panzers <b>of</b> General Rommel. <b>The</b> town was reduced to <b>rubble.</b> 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town was destroyed and <b>the</b> spire <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church collapsed.|$|R
25|$|During {{the day on}} 19 December all forces {{abandoned}} the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twin villages, and General Robertson ordered {{the remnants of the}} 2nd Division to withdraw to defensive positions dug into the open terrain along the ridge. Troops from the remaining elements of the 99th Infantry Division also used this time to withdraw to Elsenborn Ridge and fortify positions on it. They found it required dynamite to blow holes in the frozen ground.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, {{after the}} {{expiration}} of his exclusive contract with Warner Bros., Blanc continued working for WB, but also began providing voices for the TV cartoons produced by Hanna-Barbera; {{his most famous}} roles during this time were Barney <b>Rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Flintstones and Cosmo Spacely of The Jetsons. His other voice roles for Hanna-Barbara included Dino the Dinosaur, Secret Squirrel, Speed Buggy, and Captain Caveman, as well as voices for Wally Gator and The Perils of Penelope Pitstop.|$|E
25|$|It {{is a very}} rural area, {{which is}} best known for the beach {{communities}} of Mazunte, San Agustinillo and La Ventanilla. The National Turtle Center, a research center and aquarium is located in Mazunte, along with conservation centers for butterflies and iguanas. The town itself is the site of the largest annual festival in the area, celebrating the rescue of a cedar image of the Virgin Mary from the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town church after an earthquake on 11 May 1870.|$|E
50|$|Even in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 5th century, {{a simple}} burial pit was dug in <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rooms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospitalia, {{eating away at}} the mosaic floor.In the 7th century, at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Longobardian conquest, <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> villa provide shelter to {{isolated}} sporadic groups of pastoralists and refugees.|$|R

25|$|Abbot Suger's {{innovative}} choir <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abbey <b>of</b> Saint-Denis, 1140–44, led to <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gothic style by Paris and {{its surrounding}} area, but other parts of France were slower to take it up, and provincial churches continued {{to be built in}} the heavy manner and <b>rubble</b> stone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romanesque, even when the openings were treated with the fashionable pointed arch.|$|R
25|$|The {{distributors}} also purport {{that the}} coins {{have been struck}} using silver recovered from a vault in the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World Trade Center. The validity of this claim has not been confirmed. Distributors warn that the minting of the coin will cease once the quantity of recovered silver has been exhausted, and have therefore placed a limit {{on the number of}} coins that can be ordered per person. The coins are not solid silver, but are silver clad (0.0001inch (2.5 micrometre) layer). Actual silver content is 45mg, or 0.00145 troy oz.|$|E
25|$|During {{the battle}} against the Taliban, each Green Beret A-Team carried with them a piece of steel {{recovered}} from the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World Trade Center {{in honor of the}} 9/11 victims. Later during the war, they each buried their piece of steel at a significant point in the battle. Bowers chose Mazar-i-Sharif as the location to bury his piece of the World Trade Center. This was the location of one of their toughest battles and where CIA officer Mike Spann became the first American killed in action in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} {{emerges from}} the passage and teeters {{on the edge of}} a vast pit of lava. Another transport is seen attempting to cross a rickety rope bridge which spans the pit under a crumbling ceiling. On the far side of the cavern, there is a 45-foot-tall stone face of Mara, that periodically shoots green rays at both transports, causing flames to erupt from where the beam hits. Formerly, there was an effect in place within this scene where the light beams would hit the ceiling, causing dyed ice cubes to rain down, simulating the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caving temple, but it was removed. The light beams have now been redirected away from the former effect, however, the sound effect for the rubble still plays upon entering the room. The transport turns left and enters catacombs of false pathways lined with skeletons, some of which pop out toward the guests.|$|E

50|$|Based on the numismatic and ceramic finds, Harper dated <b>the</b> {{construction}} <b>of</b> Upper Zohar only to {{the late}} 5th century. The initial occupation had apparently been cleaned out {{some time in the}} early 6th century, eventually falling into disuse by the early 7th century, when it was finally abandoned. <b>The</b> absence <b>of</b> a destruction layer and <b>the</b> discovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skeleton <b>of</b> a child under <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towers a suggests the cause may have been an earthquake.|$|R

25|$|At Birkenau, about 37,000 Salonicans were gassed immediately, {{especially}} women, {{children and}} the elderly. Nearly {{a quarter of all}} 400 experiments perpetrated on the Jews were on Greek Jews, especially those from Salonika. These experiments included emasculation and implantation of cervical cancer in women. Most of the twins died following atrocious crimes. Others from the community last worked in the camps. In the years 1943–1944, they accounted for a significant proportion of the workforce of Birkenau, making up to 11,000 of the labourers. Because of their unfamiliarity with Yiddish, Jews from Greece were sent to clean up the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Warsaw Ghetto in August 1943 in order to build a camp. Among the 1,000 Salonican Jews employed on the task, a group of twenty managed to escape from the ghetto and join the Polish resistance, the Armia Krajowa, which organized the Warsaw Uprising.|$|E
25|$|The Niño de las Suertes has {{a strong}} {{following}} due to its association with Santa Muerte. While the image {{was created in the}} 19th century, its popular veneration is a recent phenomenon. The image was found by two evangelists in the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hacienda of San Juan de Dios in Tlalpan. It was handed over to Archbishop Francisco Lizana y Beaumont. As a number of monasteries wanted to claim it, the archbishop decided to make the decision by lottery. It is said that this image favored the Convent of San Bernardo due to the vow of poverty by its nuns. This was confirmed by doing the drawing three times. In the 19th century, due to tensions between the Mexican government and the Church, the image was moved to Tacubaya when the convent was secularized. This image has a skull by the infant's head. This originally symbolized the future Passion, but recently it has made this image associated with Santa Muerte, whose devotees visit.|$|E
25|$|Richmond emerged {{a decade}} after the {{smoldering}} <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Civil War to resume its position as an economic powerhouse, with iron front buildings and massive brick factories. Canal traffic peaked in the 1860s and slowly gave way to railroads, allowing Richmond to become a major railroad crossroads, eventually including the site of the world's first triple railroad crossing. Tobacco warehousing and processing continued to play a role, boosted by the world's first cigarette-rolling machine, invented by James Albert Bonsack of Roanoke in 1880/81. Contributing to Richmond's resurgence was the first successful electrically powered trolley system in the United States, the Richmond Union Passenger Railway. Designed by electric power pioneer Frank J. Sprague, the trolley system opened its first line in 1888, and electric streetcar lines rapidly spread to other cities across the country. Sprague's system used an overhead wire and trolley pole to collect current, with electric motors on the car's trucks. In Richmond, the transition from streetcars to buses began in May 1947 and was completed on November 25, 1949.|$|E
50|$|Although the bombed {{site was}} cleared <b>of</b> much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> and all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{remaining}} decorative sculpture, rebuilding was repeatedly postponed by successive post-War governments, {{in favour of}} reconstruction projects that were deemed to be more pressing.|$|R
2500|$|The {{substructures}} were {{dug into}} the hard sand, some [...] below the surface, and lined with smooth limestone blocks. A passage leads to a quartzite portcullis, intended to stop tomb robbers from reaching the burial chamber. Beyond the portcullis was a stone-lined chamber [...] in dimensions, <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> which hid a further passage blocked by two portcullises, one of limestone and another of quartzite. Beyond, lies the burial chamber housing a massive sarcophagus built from three blocks of quartzite sandstone, roughly hewn on the outside, but well polished on the inside. <b>The</b> southern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burial chamber also had a recess meant to hold grave goods. Overall, <b>the</b> plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substructures <b>of</b> tomb S9 is {{similar to those found}} in <b>the</b> Pyramid <b>of</b> Khendjer. Small fragments of burned wood were uncovered there during the 1901 excavations suggest that <b>the</b> wooden coffin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king was destroyed. Since then, burned bandages, small pieces [...] of inscribed, gilded plaster from the king's mummy mask, and pieces of wood and faience inlay, stone jars, beads, and bone needles were unearthed in the substructures as well as in <b>the</b> <b>rubbles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enclosure wall.|$|R
25|$|Eventually the {{facility}} was cleared <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> <b>rubble</b> and ruins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German air base. Concrete taxiways, parking ramps and dispersal pads were removed {{and turned into}} hardcore aggregate, eventually clearing the land which was leased to farmers for agricultural fields.|$|R
500|$|Gavin Hood has {{announced}} that multiple [...] "secret endings" [...] exist for the film and that the endings will differ from print to print of the film. One version shows Wolverine drinking in a Japanese bar. The bartender asks if he is drinking to forget, to which Logan replies that he is drinking to remember. The other ending shows Weapon XI on the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destroyed tower, trying to touch his severed head.|$|E
500|$|Ethan Allen {{and his men}} {{eventually}} {{drifted away}} from Ticonderoga, especially once the alcohol began to run out, and Arnold largely controlled affairs from a base at Crown Point. [...] He oversaw the fitting of the two large ships, eventually taking command of Enterprise {{because of a lack}} of knowledgeable seamen. [...] His men began rebuilding Ticonderoga's barracks, and worked to extract armaments from the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two forts and build gun carriages for them.|$|E
500|$|Temple 29 (Structure 5D-29) {{is located}} at the east end of the terrace of the North Acropolis, facing west. Stela 40 was {{excavated}} at its base in 1996. Temple 29 is one of a trio of similar structures, with Temples 30 and 31. Temple 29 has not been excavated; the corbel vaulting and roof has collapsed to fill the three chambers of the superstructure with <b>rubble.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> trio of temples, Temple 29 is the only one to display traces of red paint. The basal platform of the temple stands [...] high and the superstructure walls measure [...] high. The building is believed to date to the Early Classic period (c. AD 250–600).|$|E
50|$|After six {{to seven}} weeks of preparation, a {{demolition}} team reduced parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'upper school' to a pile <b>of</b> <b>rubble</b> during <b>the</b> weekend <b>of</b> 31 May to 1 June 2003, with site clearance taking place within the subsequent weeks following the demolition.|$|R
30|$|Another {{environment}} {{that could be}} considered for <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> both types of polyurethane foam is a heap <b>of</b> <b>rubble.</b> Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-adhesive nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foam, the robot can glue the rubble and traverse across the structure without deforming the ground under foot. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most interesting applications for one-part foam is building a road on water. The one-part type foam can cure on water whereas the two-part foam dissolves, and <b>the</b> density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polyurethane structure is less than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. Thus, a robot may be able to build a road on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> water and move over it.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> salvage {{excavation}} <b>of</b> a looters' tunnel in Structure 44, {{a poorly}} constructed 8th-century temple, revealed that <b>the</b> loose <b>rubble</b> infill <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple had collapsed the tunnel before it reached a royal tomb, which was left intact. The tomb was excavated by Juan Antonio Valdés and was discovered {{to be that}} of king Chanal Balam, the ruler who overthrew Dos Pilas in AD 761. The funerary temple containing the tomb possesses inscriptions celebrating Chanal Balam's great victory over his former overlord.|$|R
500|$|British Columbia Highway3 is a two-lane {{undivided}} {{highway that}} becomes Alberta Highway3 {{at the border}} in mountainous terrain, paralleling {{a branch of the}} Canadian Pacific Railway. [...] It first crosses over to {{the south side of the}} railway and passes through the centre of Island Lake on a causeway, part of which is natural terrain. [...] It curves through communities of the Municipality of Crowsnest Pass on the south side of Crowsnest Lake, crossing the Crowsnest River and reaching Highway40 at Coleman. [...] It continues alongside the railway through Blairmore, again crossing the Crowsnest River and bisecting the community of Frank and the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Frank Slide, a major landslide that killed more than 70 people in 1903. The highway, the Crowsnest River, and the railway meander east into the Municipal District of Pincher Creek No.9 and Burmis from which Highway507 splits south to Beaver Mines and forms an alternate route from the west into Pincher Creek. [...] Highway3 curves northeast to the hamlet of Lundbreck which it bypasses, and from which Highway22 begins and runs north. [...] The first of four former alignments of Highway3 (all of which are now designated as Highway3A) passes through Lundbreck, splitting from Highway3 prior to the hamlet and rejoining it [...] later.|$|E
500|$|At the lighthouse, Mr. Briscoe {{decides to}} brave the storm in a landing craft, but is {{immediately}} swamped {{with water and}} carried by the tide towards the mainland. After Castro avails himself of {{the services of a}} prostitute, he rampages around the property searching for Picasso. The storm crashes through the inn. A guest is killed by a billiards table that falls on top of him and is dragged off into the sea. Mr. Glowery is also dragged off into the sea by the storm. Castro and his assistant round up the guests and interrogate them about the location of the $1.5 million Picasso stole. In another part of the inn a fire starts. Finally, Mr. Briscoe shows up and kills Castro's assistant before knocking Castro unconscious. While Hawthorne learns his wife is leaving him for the prostitute, the inn becomes completely engulfed in flames. Picasso, Hawthorne, and Briscoe motor a lobster boat over to the lighthouse, and dump Castro's dead assistant into the sea along with Castro himself, weighed down with two cinder blocks chained to his ankles. When they land on the island, Briscoe runs into the lighthouse and blows himself up. Amongst the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lighthouse, Picasso notices the inscription [...] "MORTE D'AUTHOR" [...] painted on one of the surrounding rocks and says to the innkeeper [...] "He's been thinking about this for some time, George." ...|$|E
500|$|The old Bronzeville campus left a {{deep and}} lasting legacy on the University of Chicago. The {{affinity}} for Gothic architecture first began in 1857 at the Bronzeville campus as did the University of Chicago's tradition of public debate as sport. [...] The current quarter system practiced at the University of Chicago was an innovation that began at the Bronzeville campus and continues uninterrupted to this day. [...] Alumni from the pre-1890 Bronzville campus are recognized as alumni of the University of Chicago today while {{more than half of}} the university's post-1890 trustees and donors (including its largest donor John D. Rockefeller) had a relationship to the University of Chicago prior to 1890. The university's current mascot of a Phoenix rising from the ashes is a reference to the fire, foreclosure, and demolition of the original Bronzeville campus with the current Hyde Park campus emerging triumphantly in its place. As an homage to this pre-1890 legacy a single stone from the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original Douglas Hall in Bronzeville was brought to the current Hyde Park location and set into the wall of the Classics Building. To honor Stephen A. Douglas, a bronze bust of the university's founding donor was placed in Hutchinson Commons which is today the main dining hall and student center on campus. All told these connections have led the Dean of the College and University of Chicago and Professor of History John Boyer to conclude that the University of Chicago has a [...] "plausible genealogy as a pre– Civil War institution".|$|E
50|$|During World War II, {{after the}} Germans {{suppressed}} the Warsaw Uprising, they razed the Jesuit Church to the ground.

5|$|Reading Abbey {{was founded}} by Henry I in 1121.
