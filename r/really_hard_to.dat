They played well, but I think we controlled the game. To score three goals is not easy. I can say that we are very happy now with this trophy. Now is the time to enjoy our victory."

And so as much as it's important to talk about it, I wanted to be vague and not milk it." [...] Chaiken has also admitted {{that the use of}} dream sequences involving Jenny were not a successful inclusion, but claimed it was necessary to portray Jenny coming to terms with her abuse. Heather Hogan of AfterEllen criticized the storyline because there was no conclusion to it, also stating it was never explored enough, leading everyone to think she was just a jerk.|$|E

Ament said, [...] "We tried <b>really</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>to</b> make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had to put it in sideways." [...] The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy. Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright. The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album.|$|E

[...] However, analysts in the gymnastics community, including University of Georgia head coach Suzanne Yoculan, former Olympian John Roethlisberger and International Gymnast editor Paul Ziert, noted that the American team started the competition at a difficult point deficit to the Chinese and that mathematically, Sacramone could not have been personally or exclusively responsible for the U.S. team's results. Teammate Bridget Sloan also said in an interview, [...] "We've all made mistakes.

500|$|Aside {{from the}} romantic theme in her storyline Ruby {{has been shown}} as an {{aspiring}} singer. Breeds is classically trained in real life and said she doesn't mind singing on camera. Discussing this she stated: [...] "When you're playing a character you can hide behind them. I know it's still my voice, [...] I was more confident singing from Ruby's point of view. Even {{though there was a}} storyline where she was terrified about singing in a school play, I wasn't nervous at all. I had to try <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> make myself feel nervous." [...] She revealed she had to play down her voice and make it [...] "a bit cleaner" [...] and a [...] "bit more inexperienced". This was due to the fact {{it was meant to be}} that she had never sung before – [...] "I have to pull her back a bit." [...] She added the storyline was realistic because there are no set guidelines for discovering vocal talent.|$|E

He agreed despite being still contractually obligated with Infinity Optimal Solutions (IOS), a celebrity management firm who dealt with his media appearances and ramp walks as a male model.

500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more {{comfortable}} within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, {{and then you have to}} think, 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' You get to a certain point, and it's <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> remember what music is and to remember what drives you." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to the DVD commentary, [...] "this was a <b>really,</b> <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> episode <b>to</b> do" [...] because sports {{episodes in}} general aren't easy {{but also because}} the teams are trying to lose.

500|$|Six {{companies}} {{working on}} different scenes and elements created 500shots of visual {{effects in the}} film. These were at times altered weekly due to the reactions of test audiences in screenings. CIS Visual Effects Group assisted with the Scorcher VI faux trailer and twenty additional shots for the home media release. To expand on the comedy in the film, some of the explosions and crashes were embellished to look more destructive. The visual effects supervisor Michael Fink reflected on the exaggerated explosions: [...] "We worked <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> make the CG crashing helicopter in the hot landing sequence look real. Ben was adamant about that, {{but at the same}} time he wanted the explosion to be huge. When you see it hit the ground, it was like it was filled with gasoline! It was the same thing with Ben's sergeant character, who almost intercepts a hand grenade... Now, I was in the Army for three years and no hand grenade would make an explosion like that... But it was a big dramatic moment and it looks really cool... and feels kind of real." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{himself said}} {{he decided to}} open the film in December {{so that it would}} have less {{competition}} from then to January.

Gray said, [...] "At this point, {{people who are going to}} see Avatar are going to see Avatar and would even if the slate was strong." [...] Marketing the film as a [...] "novelty factor" [...] also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theatres. [...] "It's <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home," [...] stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com. The [...] "Oscar buzz" [...] surrounding the film and international viewings helped. [...] "Two-thirds of Titanics haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [...] similarly...Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them", and the markets [...] "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" [...] with [...] "more screens and moviegoers" [...] than before.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review {{calling the}} soundtrack [...] "unengaging". He theorized {{that it was}} due to Madonna's performance. Erlewine commended Madonna's singing but deduced that her vocals made the songs sound like she was [...] "trying <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> be credible, which makes it {{difficult}} to connect with her". While reviewing the film, San Francisco Chronicles Octavio Roca's feeling about the soundtrack was mixed, saying that the [...] "delicious irony of Rice's lyrics remains intact, as does the freshness of Lloyd Webber's music". But Roca believed that the Latin influences present in the original songs were missing, due to John Mauceri's [...] "languid conducting of the soundtrack, and most of all by Vincent Paterson's choreography". A negative review came from The Baltimore Sun; critic J. D. Considine felt the soundtrack would disappoint Madonna fans [...] "because Evita just isn't pop music—or, at least, not the kind of pop music Madonna usually makes on her own... As a result, slogging through Evita is like listening to an opera written by someone who never got beyond learning how to write recitativo". Considine was also disappointed with the vocal abilities of Madonna and co-star Antonio Banderas; [...] "they lack the power and tone to lend this intoned dialog a patina of musicality". Finally, Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "soundtrack of mediocre '70s rock".|$|E
5000|$|... "It was a <b>really,</b> <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> choice <b>to</b> make," [...] Stocks says.
