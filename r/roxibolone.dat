50|$|<b>Roxibolone</b> (INN) (developmental {{code name}} BR-906), {{also known as}} 11β,17β-dihydroxy-17α-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-2-carboxylic acid, is a steroidal antiglucocorticoid {{described}} as an anticholesterolemic (cholesterol-lowering) and anabolic drug which was never marketed. <b>Roxibolone</b> {{is closely related to}} formebolone, which shows antiglucocorticoid activity similarly and, with the exception of having a carboxaldehyde group at the C2 position instead of a carboxylic acid group, <b>roxibolone</b> is structurally almost identical to. The 2- ester of <b>roxibolone,</b> decylroxibolone (developmental code name BR-917), is a long-acting prodrug of <b>roxibolone</b> with similar activity.|$|E
50|$|Unlike formebolone, {{which is}} {{additionally}} an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS), <b>roxibolone</b> is devoid of {{affinity for the}} androgen receptor and possesses no androgenic or myotrophic activity in animal assays. For this reason, {{it has been said}} that <b>roxibolone</b> may be much better tolerated in comparison.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roxibolone</b> {{has been}} found not to bind to the {{glucocorticoid}} receptor, {{and it has been}} suggested that the antiglucocorticoid activity of <b>roxibolone</b> and formebolone may instead be mediated by modulation of enzymatic processes. Indeed, 11α- and 11β-hydroxyprogesterone (formebolone and <b>roxibolone</b> being 11α- and 11β-hydroxylated (respectively) similarly) are known to be potent inhibitors of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD), which is responsible for the biosynthesis of the potent endogenous glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone (from the precursors deoxycortisol and deoxycorticosterone, respectively). However, formebolone was found to be a very weak inhibitor of 11β-HSD type 2 (IC50 > 10 μM), although this specific isoenzyme of 11β-HSD is responsible for the inactivation of glucocorticoids rather than their production.|$|E
50|$|In rats, <b>roxibolone</b> {{counteracts}} the catabolic effects (control {{of nitrogen}} balance) and increased alkaline phosphatase levels {{induced by the}} potent glucocorticoid dexamethasone phosphate. It does not bind to the glucocorticoid receptor however, and its antiglucocorticoid activity may instead be mediated by enzyme inhibition. In accordance, 11α- and 11β-hydroxyprogesterone {{are known to be}} potent inhibitors of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD), which is responsible for the biosynthesis of the potent endogenous glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone (from the precursors deoxycortisol and deoxycorticosterone, respectively). As <b>roxibolone</b> is 11β-hydroxylated similarly, it may act in a likewise fashion. However, formebolone was found to be a very weak inhibitor of 11β-HSD type 2, although this specific isoenzyme is responsible for the inactivation of glucocorticoids rather than their production.|$|E
50|$|Formebolone (INN, BAN) (brand names Esiclene, Hubernol, Metanor), {{also known}} (confusingly) as formyldienolone, {{as well as}} 2-formyl-11α-hydroxy-17α-methyl-δ1-testosterone, is an orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) {{described}} as an anticatabolic and anabolic drug that is or has been marketed in Spain and Italy. As an AAS, it shows some anabolic activity, though it is inferior to testosterone in terms of potency, but {{is said to have}} virtually no androgenic activity. Formebolone counteracts the catabolic effects (control of nitrogen balance) of potent glucocorticoids like dexamethasone phosphate. A close analogue, <b>roxibolone</b> (and its long-acting ester variant decylroxibolone), shows similar antiglucocorticoid activity to formebolone but, in contrast, is devoid of activity as an AAS.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 2 -carboxy- 1, 4 -androstadien- 3 -one {{derivatives}} and their alkyl esters, were prepared by high-yield syntheses. The compounds were structurally identified by physical methods. All these steroids {{are characterized by}} a marked antiglucocorticoid activity that proved long-acting {{in the case of}} the ester derivatives. 2 -Carboxy- 11 β, 17 β-dihydroxy- 17 -methyl- 1, 4 -androstadien- 3 -one or <b>roxibolone,</b> and its n-decylester or decylroxibolone, are the most promising derivatives in consideration of their pharmacological properties...|$|E
