5|$|Most of the region's fauna {{is typical}} of desert environments. Species include the <b>red</b> <b>kangaroo,</b> the eastern wallaroo (also known as the euro), the {{northern}} nail-tail wallaby, and the spinifex hopping mouse. The central pebble-mound mouse also occurs in the region, and other mammal species including the Forrest's mouse, desert mouse and short-beaked echidna have been predicted by biologists to occur on the station. The station may lie {{within the range of}} the critically endangered night parrot (Pezoporus occidentalis). There is relatively high diversity and abundance of reptiles, including the military dragon (Ctenophorus isolepis gularis) and the sand goanna (Varanus gouldii flavirufus).|$|E

It appears as a shield bearer on the Coat of arms of Australia with the <b>red</b> <b>kangaroo,</b> and {{as a part of}} the Arms also appears on the Australian 50 cent coin. It has featured on numerous Australian postage stamps, including a pre-federation New South Wales 100th Anniversary issue from 1888, which featured a 2 pence blue emu stamp, a 36 cent stamp released in 1986, and a $1.35 stamp released in 1994.

40|$|The {{population}} dynamics of <b>red</b> <b>kangaroos</b> (Macropus rufus) in the Australian arid zone is tightly linked with environmental factors, which partly operate via {{the survival of}} juvenile animals. A crucial stage is the young-at-foot (YAF) stage when kangaroos permanently exit the pouch. We have examined the thermal biology of YAF <b>red</b> <b>kangaroos</b> during ages from permanent pouch exit until weaning. Over {{a wide range of}} environmental temperatures (ambient temperature [T-a] - 5 degrees to 45 degreesC), YAF <b>red</b> <b>kangaroos</b> had a mass-specific metabolism that was generally twice that of adults, considerably higher than would be expected for an adult marsupial of their body size. The total energy requirements of YAF <b>red</b> <b>kangaroos</b> were 60 %- 70 % of those of adult females, which were three times their size. Over the same range in T-a, YAF <b>red</b> <b>kangaroos</b> also had total evaporative water losses equal to those of adult females. At the highest Ta (45 degreesC), differences were noted in patterns of dry heat loss (dry conductance) between YAF <b>red</b> <b>kangaroos</b> and adult females, which may partially explain the relatively high levels of evaporative cooling by YAF. By weaning age, young kangaroos showed little change in their basal energy and water requirements (at T-a 25 degreesC) but did show reduced mass-specific costs in terms of energy and water use at extremes of T-a (- 5 degrees and 45 degreesC, respectively). In their arid environment, typified by unpredictable rainfall and extremes of T-a, young <b>red</b> <b>kangaroos</b> may need to remain close to water points, which, in turn, may restrict their ability to find the high-quality forage needed to meet their high energy demands...|$|R

25|$|The <b>red</b> <b>kangaroo</b> (Macropus rufus) is {{the largest}} {{surviving}} marsupial anywhere in the world. It occupies the arid and semi-arid centre of the country. The highest population densities of the <b>red</b> <b>kangaroo</b> occur in the rangelands of western New South Wales. Red kangaroos are commonly mistaken as the most abundant species of kangaroo, but eastern greys actually have a larger population. A large male can be 2 metres (6ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90kg (200lb).|$|E
25|$|After the war, a {{range of}} options for the RAAF roundel were proposed, {{including}} the Southern Cross, a boomerang, a sprig of wattle, and the <b>red</b> <b>kangaroo.</b> On 2 July 1956, {{the current version of}} the roundel was formally adopted. This consists of a white inner circle with a <b>red</b> <b>kangaroo</b> surrounded by a royal blue circle. The kangaroo faces left, except when used on aircraft or vehicles, when the kangaroo should always face in the direction of travel. Low visibility versions of the roundel exist, with the white omitted and the red and blue replaced with light or dark grey.|$|E

25|$|No. 456 Squadron RAAF was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) night fighter squadron, {{operational}} over Europe during World War II.

25|$|The {{middle to}} late bulungmayines, Gungaroo and Wanburoo lacked digit 1 of the hind foot and digits 2 and 3 were reduced and partly under the large digit 4, {{much like the}} modern {{kangaroo}} foot. This would indicate that they were bipedal. In addition their ankle bones had an articulation that would have prohibited much lateral movements, an adaptation for bipedal hopping. Species related to the modern grey kangaroos and wallaroos begin {{to appear in the}} Pliocene. The <b>red</b> <b>kangaroo</b> appears to be the most recently evolved kangaroo with its fossil record not going back beyond the Pleistocene period, 1–2 mya.|$|E
25|$|There {{are very}} few records of {{kangaroos}} attacking humans without provocation; however, several such unprovoked attacks in 2004 spurred fears of a rabies-like disease possibly affecting the marsupials. The only reliably documented case of a fatality from a kangaroo attack occurred in New South Wales, in 1936. A hunter was killed {{when he tried to}} rescue his two dogs from a heated fray. Other suggested causes for erratic and dangerous kangaroo behaviour include extreme thirst and hunger. In July 2011, a male <b>red</b> <b>kangaroo</b> attacked a 94-year-old woman in her own backyard as well as her son and two police officers responding to the situation. The kangaroo was capsicum sprayed (pepper sprayed) and later put down after the attack.|$|E
25|$|An {{incident}} in which a US Navy Wildcat mistook a No. 11 Squadron Catalina for a Japanese aircraft resulted in the adoption of what became the modern RAAF Roundel. At the time, RAAF aircraft were using the RAF roundel and the USN aircraft mistook this for the Japanese red circular aircraft marking. The aftermath led to {{the removal of the}} red colour from the centre of the roundel, which remained as the standard RAAF roundel in the Pacific {{for the remainder of the}} war. Post-war, the standard RAF roundel was reinstated, while the current roundel consisting of the blue outer ring surrounding a <b>red</b> <b>kangaroo</b> in motion was adopted in June 1956.|$|E

25|$|Kangaroos have single-chambered stomachs quite {{unlike those}} of cattle and sheep. They {{sometimes}} regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then swallow it again for final digestion, {{but this is}} a different, and more strenuous, activity than it is in ruminants, and does not take place as frequently. Different species of kangaroos have different diets, although all are strict herbivores. The eastern grey kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, eating a wide variety of grasses, whereas some other species (e.g. the <b>red</b> <b>kangaroo)</b> include significant amounts of shrubs in their diets. The smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi. Many species are nocturnal, and crepuscular, usually spending the days resting in shade, and the cool evenings, nights and mornings moving about and feeding.|$|E
25|$|The macropods {{are divided}} into three families: the Hypsiprymnodontidae, with the musky rat-kangaroo as its only member; the Potoroidae, with 11 species; and the Macropodidae, with 45 species. Macropods are found in all Australian environments except alpine areas. The Potoroidae include the bettongs, potaroos and rat-kangaroos, small species that make nests and carry plant {{material}} with their tails. The Macropodiae include kangaroos, wallabies and associated species; size varies widely within this family. Most macropods have large hind legs and long, narrow hind feet, with a distinctive arrangement of four toes, and powerfully muscled tails, which they use to hop around. The musky rat-kangaroo is the smallest macropod and the only species that is quadrupedal not bipedal, while the male <b>red</b> <b>kangaroo</b> is the largest, reaching a height of about 2m and weighing up to 85kg.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroo {{reproduction}} {{is similar to}} that of opossums. The egg (still contained in the shell membrane, a few micrometres thick, and with only a small quantity of yolk within it) descends from the ovary into the uterus. There it is fertilised and quickly develops into a neonate. Even in the largest kangaroo (the <b>red</b> <b>kangaroo)</b> the neonate emerges after only 33 days. Usually, only one young is born at a time. It is blind, hairless, and only a few centimetres long; its hindlegs are mere stumps; it instead uses its more developed forelegs to climb its way through the thick fur on its mother's abdomen into the pouch, which takes about three to five minutes. Once in the pouch, it fastens onto one of the four teats and starts to feed. Almost immediately, the mother's sexual cycle starts again. Another egg descends into the uterus and she becomes sexually receptive. Then, if she mates and a second egg is fertilised, its development is temporarily halted. Meanwhile, the neonate in the pouch grows rapidly. After about 190 days, the baby (joey) is sufficiently large and developed to make its full emergence out of the pouch, after sticking its head out for a few weeks until it eventually feels safe enough to fully emerge. From then on, it spends increasing time in the outside world and eventually, after about 235 days, it leaves the pouch for the last time. The lifespan of kangaroos averages at six years in the wild to in excess of 20 years in captivity, varying by species. Most individuals, however, do not reach maturity in the wild.|$|E

500|$|The {{amount of}} energy stored in the tendons {{increases}} with the animal's speed {{and the weight of}} the load it is carrying. This is particularly helpful for mothers carrying young, [...] and explains why tammars can increase their hopping speed without using more energy. [...] The tammar shares this characteristic with other plains-dwelling macropods like the <b>red</b> <b>kangaroo.</b> By comparison, rock wallabies, such as the yellow-footed rock-wallaby, have traded efficient energy saving for greater tendon thickness; an adaption for steep rocky terrain as it allows them to leap higher and lowers the risk of their tendons rupturing.|$|E
500|$|In the Americas, Betelgeuse signifies a severed limb of a man-figure (Orion)—the Taulipang of Brazil {{know the}} {{constellation}} as Zililkawai, a hero whose leg {{was cut off}} by his wife, with the variable light from Betelgeuse linked to the severing of the limb. Similarly, the Lakota people of North America {{see it as a}} chief whose arm has been severed. The Wardaman people of northern Australia knew the star as Ya-jungin [...] "Owl Eyes Flicking", its variable light signifying its intermittent watching of ceremonies led by the <b>Red</b> <b>Kangaroo</b> Leader Rigel.
