40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} role of {{occupational}} exposures to solvents and aluminium in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). An industrial hygienist <b>rated</b> <b>exposure.</b> METHODS: 89 subjects diagnosed with probable AD were matched by age, sex, and type of informant to 89 controls. Subjects were identified from a large health maintenance organisation in Seattle, WA. A complete occupational history was obtained from spouses of cases and controls {{as well as from}} controls themselves. After the interview an industrial hygienist, blinded to case-control status, rated exposures. RESULTS: Non-significant associations were found between AD and ever having been occupationally exposed to solvents (odds ratio (OR) 1. 77, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 81 to 3. 90) and aluminium (OR 1. 46, 95 % CI 0. 62 to 3. 42). Although an increasing risk was found with increasing number of years of exposure to solvents, there was an inverse association between exposure intensity and AD, and measures of cumulative exposure taking into account both intensity and duration of exposure were not significant. Analysis of the age at which half the cumulative exposure to solvents was achieved showed that an older age incurred a greater risk of AD than a younger age. However, the total amount of exposure carried no risk. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that lifetime occupational exposure to solvents and aluminium {{are not likely to be}} important risk factors for Alzheimer's disease...|$|E

It has given rise to an extensive body of research, mainly focused on the estimation of sensitivity of bank stock returns to changes in interest rates. However, the analysis of the sources of bank interest rate risk has received much less attention in the literature. Studies that empirically investigate the determinants of bank interest <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> have traditionally used asset-liability maturity or duration gap as the key factor explaining banks‟ interest <b>rate</b> <b>exposure.</b> However, this approach presents serious drawbacks given the well-known limitations of static gap indicators, together with the difficulties to obtain precise year-by-year gap measures for most of banks. For this reason, an alternative was to examine the association between each bank‟s estimated interest <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> and a set of readily observable specific characteristics that might have a potentially relevant role in explaining that exposure. The aim of this research was to investigate the main determinants of the interest <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> of commercial banks by focusing on how total assets, off balance sheet items, bank‟s deposit and loan composition affect interest <b>rate</b> <b>exposure.</b> The research involved use of both primary and secondary data methodology. Secondary data was obtained from CBK. Primary data was collected via questionnaires from ALCO members. The research population comprised the 43 CBs operating in Kenya with a sample size of 65 respondents. The response rate for the questionnaires which were distributed was 77 %. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistical approach. Data analysis was conducted through Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). The result was presented using charts and tables. It was established from the research findings that indeed banks total assets, customer deposits and loan composition are key determinants of bank interest <b>rate</b> <b>exposure.</b> However, there was lack of information on the off balance sheet items and thus their effect on interest <b>rate</b> <b>exposure.</b> The research recommends that CBs should in addition to traditional considerations of asset – liability maturity period take into account total assets, loan composition and customer deposits level in determining interest <b>rates</b> <b>exposure.</b> The ALCO should also encourage policies that increase savings deposits that provide cheap financing and shield the bank against interest <b>rate</b> <b>exposure.</b> The banks should ensure information and benefits of the off balance sheet income is disseminated within the banks and increase use of off balance sheet income hedge against the interest <b>rate</b> <b>exposure.</b> The commercial banks should reduce dependency on corporate deposits that attract high interest rates.

40|$|In this paper, we use {{a sample}} of 186 firms in Taiwan that have export ratios of at least 10 percent in the sample period to examine (1) what's {{difference}} {{in the level of}} exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> between long-term and short-term, (2) whether exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> is symmetric or asymmetric and (3) the influence in the determinants of exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> and derivatives on exposure. We find evidence that (1) the number of firms having significant exposure increases with time horizon. That is consistent with prior findings of Chow, Lee and Solt (1997). It also appears that Taiwanese firms are overwhelmingly negatively exposed to exchange rate change. The result indicates that in the returns on Taiwanese firms' stock generally decline when the NT dollars depreciates. (2) In asymmetric exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure,</b> our results show that exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> in the longer return horizons on Taiwanese firms are overwhelmingly asymmetric. The number of firms having significant asymmetric exposure increases with time horizon. (3) In the determinants of exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure,</b> we find that exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> is positively related to the foreign sales ratio, firm size and quick ratio. Further, we add an interaction term by multiplying the degree of using foreign currency derivatives with other proxies of hedging incentives. The results show that in shorter return horizons, we can use derivatives to reduce exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> as leverage ratio or firm size is higher. In longer return horizons, as the foreign sales ratio is higher, we can also use derivatives to reduce exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure.</b> Besides, all of the proxies of hedging incentives are not significant in longer return horizons. 本文主要以 186 家台灣上市公司，外銷比例大於 10 %的公司為樣本，研究 (1) 外匯暴露的長短期效果有何不同，(2) 外匯暴露是否具有不對稱性效果及 (3) 外匯暴露的決定因子及衍生性金融商品使用對外匯暴露的影響。 實證結果發現：(1) 隨著觀察的時間越長，具顯著外匯暴露的公司也跟著增加，和Chow、Lee 與 Solt (1997) 的研究結果類似；在符號方面則是以負的外匯暴露居多，表示平均而言，國內公司在台幣貶值時，會有不利的影響； (2) 在不對稱性效果方面，研究結果顯示，在長期時，國內公司普遍存在外匯暴露不對稱性效果，並且隨時間越長，具不對稱性效果家數越多； (3) 在外匯暴露決定因子方面，不論長短期，外銷比例、公司規模及速動比率和外匯暴露程度為正相關；另外，若同時考慮與衍生性金融商品的交互作用效果之後，研究結果發現：在短期時，長期負債比例、外銷比例或公司規模越大時，公司若多使用衍生性金融商品，則外匯暴露的程度可以顯著降低；在長期時，當外銷比例越高時，多使用衍生性金融商品避險亦可降低外匯暴露的程度;而避險活動指標則都不顯著。第一章 緒論 1 第一節 研究背景 1 第二節 研究動機 1 第三節 研究目的 2 第四節 研究架構 3 第二章 理論基礎與文獻探討 4 第一節 外匯暴露的定義與衡量 4 第二節 外匯暴露的類型 4 第三節 衍生性金融商品之介紹 6 第四節 外匯暴露之長短期效果 10 第五節 外匯暴露之不對稱性效果 13 第六節 外匯暴露決定因子 16 第三章 研究設計 24 第一節 研究假說 24 第二節 研究方法與模型 28 第三節 研究期間的設定及樣本的選取 32 第四節 變數的定義及衡量的方式 33 第四章 國內公司使用衍生性金融商品之情形 36 第一節 公司使用衍生性金融商品之情形 36 第二節 公司使用衍生性金融商品之種類 37 第三節 公司規避風險之種類及使用工具 39 第五章 實證結果與分析 40 第一節 長短期外匯暴露的估計 40 第二節 產業特性對長短期外匯暴露的影響 42 第三節 外匯暴露的不對稱性效果 43 第四節 外匯暴露決定因子之研究 46 第六章 結論與建議 60 第一節 研究結論 60 第二節 研究限制與建議 63 參考文獻 6...|$|R

To a large extent, past research has not supported this theory. which is surprising especially after considering the substantial exchange ratc fluctuations over the last three' decades. This study extends previous research on the foreign exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> using a sample of 364 UK nonfinancial companies over the period from January 1981 to December 2001. The impact of the changes (realised and unexpected) in exchange rates on firms' or industries' stock returns is examined. In addition, the movements in bilateral, equally weighted and trade-weighted exchange rate indices arc considered. The findings indicate that a higher percentage ofUK firms and industries arc exposed to contemporaneous exchange rate changes than those reported in previous studies. UK firms' and industries' stock returns are more affected by changes in the ECU. EQW. US$ and JPY exchange rate, and less significantly to the basket of 20 countries' currencies relative to the British pound exchange rate. There is alsO evidence of significant lagged exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure.</b> This lagged exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> is consistent with findings in previous studies that some market inefficiencies may exist in incorporating exchange rate changes into the returns of firms and industries.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{volatility}} of exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> and its associated risk have become a hot issue in international financial management. It is often assumed that a firm’s future operating cash flows is proxied by its market value, and the exposure coe fficient {{would be able to}} ef ficiently measure the impact of exchange rate changes on a firm’s return and its se nsitivity to the changes. Recen tly, some studies begin to investigate whether exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> is asymmetric between currency appreciations and depreciations. By far most existing studies on exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> assume that the variances of a firm’s returns and exchange rates changes are time-invariant. In this paper, we assess empirically the validity of this assumption, and argue that the conven iently defined exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> is inadequate for measuring the entire impact of exchange rate changes on a firm’s future operating cash flows in cases of time-varying variances. There are at least four alternative routes through which a firm’s returns are exposed to foreign exchange risks when the vari ances are time-variant. The four aspects of exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> or the mu lti-elements of exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> are defines as follows: • the first route is that a firm’s stock returns are e xposed to the exchange rate changes either directly or indirectly through its business linkages with other firms. • the second route captures the exposure to the volatility of exchange rate changes, namely, the sensitivity of a firm’s value to the degree of fluctuations of exchange rates. If the degree of fluctuations is time-varying, the firm may react to change its marketing, production location and hedging strategies. • the third level of exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> measures the sensitivity of conditional variance of the returns to the volatility of exchange rate changes. Even if the second relationship is absent, as long as the conditional variances of returns are exposed to volatility of exchange rate changes and the returns are sensitive to its own volatility changes, there still exists the possibility of an indirect impact of exchange rate volatility on returns. As a consequence, the firm may have to re-assess and even change its current business strategies which may in turn affect its profitability. • The fourth route indicates the time-varying conditional correlation between returns and exchange rate changes, through which the dynamics of a firm’s exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> will be captured. We employ the bivariate GJR-GARCH-M models to inves tigate the four aspects of exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure,</b> by using data of the daily industrial indexes of ten sectors in Japan during the period from 1992 to 2000.

The analyst must take into consideration GM's liability management policy guidelines, the firm's existing interest <b>rate</b> <b>exposure,</b> his expectations of interest rates, and the wide range of interest rate products available. He must decide whether to leave the fixed-rate instrument unchanged or to enter into a swap, cap, interest rate option, or swap option transaction...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide some {{insights}} into the exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> of Australian stock returns. Design/methodology/approach - Using a dynamic econometric approach that allows for both asymmetry and time-varying risk exposures in both the exchange rate variable and the market variable, a large sample of Australian firms were tested over the period of January 2001 and December 2005. The data were analysed using three different classification methods, forming portfolios according to industry sector, size deciles, and censoring deciles. Findings - Although the evidence of exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> is limited across the sample of industries, the following were found: a time-varying asymmetric effect primarily in the utilities sector, time-varying exposure in the materials and energy sectors, and an asymmetric effect in the technology sector. Further, some time-varying asymmetric exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> was found across most size and censoring deciles and also substantial evidence of a positive asymmetric effect in the market beta across all three classification methods. Originality/value - This approach varies from previous studies in this area that only allow for asymmetry and time variation in exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposures.</b> The paper also examines the Australian stock market, a market which has not been extensively tested in this area of empirical research...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} whether {{the level of}} derivative activities of Asia-Pacific banks {{is associated with the}} market 2 ̆ 7 s perception of their interest rate and exchange rate risks. The results suggest that the level of derivative activities (especially interest rate derivatives) is positively associated with long-term interest <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> (LTIR) but negatively associated with short-term interest <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> (STIR). Further investigations reveal that the positive LTIR exposures are driven by banks with extensive derivative activities. We do not find any significant association between banks 2 ̆ 7 derivative activities and exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure.</b> The significant positive association between the level of derivative activities and LTIR suggests the need for better management of banks 2 ̆ 7 internal control systems and/or greater derivative disclosure requirements to bring stronger market discipline to banks, particularly for banks with extensive derivative activities. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> of 30 U. S. industries between 1974 and 2008 {{using traditional}} and orthogonalized linear models. Similar to the literature, when using traditional linear model {{we find that}} exposure is very time dependent and often insignificant. However, we discover that orthogonalization helps uncover more evidence of industry exposure. Within the orthogonalized linear model framework, we find that exposure is statistically and economically important, {{and the effect of}} orthogonalization is more pronounced for exposure to currency indices. We also test symmetry in exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> by subdividing the sample period into the periods of appreciations and depreciations. Interestingly, we find little evidence that exchange rate is asymmetric even if we use orthogonalized linear model. Lastly, we discover that exchange <b>rate</b> <b>exposure</b> cannot be explained by our international trade data. M. S.
