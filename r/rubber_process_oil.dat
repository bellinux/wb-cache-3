40|$|Asphalt rubber {{traditionally}} has been produced with crumb rubber coming from an ambient grinding process and mostly from car tires. With this product and the binders used in Arizona and California the specifications currently present in ASTM D 6114 have been established. Nowadays relatively {{new types of}} crumb rubber {{are available in the}} markets namely those that have been produced by cryogenic methods and can then be reprocessed if desired by a further ambient step such as through a crackermill or a Rotormill. During the reprocess stage the crumb rubber undergoes some changes. Furthermore the quantity of truck tires is now extensive and they are seeing their way into the waste flow. The purpose of this paper was to determine mainly to which extent crumb <b>rubber</b> <b>process</b> type affects asphalt rubber concrete properties.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare measured concentrations of <b>rubber</b> <b>process</b> dust and <b>rubber</b> fume originating from different sources in the British rubber manufacturing industry. Almost 8000 exposure measurements were obtained from industry-based survey results collected by the British Rubber Manufacturers’ Association (BRMA), and covering the years 1977 to 2002, and from a series of small surveys contained in the Health and Safety Executive’s (HSE) National Exposure Database (HSE-NEDB) from 1980 to 2002. The analysis investigated temporal trends in the exposure concentrations and the underlying main factors responsible for these changes. Analyses were carried out using hierarchical linear mixed effects models. Average personal exposures to <b>rubber</b> <b>process</b> dust and <b>rubber</b> fumes were respectively a factor 2 and 4 higher for the HSE-NEDB data when compared to data originating from the industry (BRMA data). Personal exposure to <b>rubber</b> <b>process</b> dust decreased on average by 4. 1 % (95 % CI 4. 7 – 3. 6) annually for the BRMA data and slightly less at 2. 3 % (95 % CI 5. 2 – 0. 7 %) per annum for the HSE-NEDB data. Personal exposure to rubber fume also showed a downward temporal trend of 2. 9 % (95 % CI 3. 6 – 2. 3 %) and 4. 8 % (95 % CI 7. 4 – 2. 1 %) annually for the BRMA and HSE-NEDB data, respectively. These trends differed considerably between departments. No major changes in the estimated temporal trends in exposure concentrations were observed after including the presence of local exhaust ventilation in the models for any department in the BRMA and HSE-NEDB datasets. Lack of information on the quality and status of the local exhaust ventilation is the most likely explanation for this. In conclusion, even though there were relatively similar downward time trends in both <b>rubber</b> <b>process</b> dust and fume concentrations in both datasets, the source of exposure data was an important determinant of average exposure concentrations present in the British rubber manufacturing industry. Lack of detailed auxiliary information on company size, reason for sampling, measurement strategy and other potentially important determinants of exposure prevented an explanation for the observed differences in exposure level...|$|R
