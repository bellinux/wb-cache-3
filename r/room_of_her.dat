500|$|The video {{opens with}} the view of a city {{populated}} with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears {{on the back of}} a statue of an angry looking swan, and utters the line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love?" [...] This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pour incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, looking across the factory from her sitting <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the workers staring up and looking for the source of the voice.|$|E
500|$|When Cisneros {{describes}} the aspirations and struggles of Chicanas, {{the theme of}} place often emerges. Place refers not only to her novels' geographic locations, {{but also to the}} positions her characters hold within their social context. Chicanas frequently occupy Anglo-dominated and male-dominated places where they are subject to a variety of oppressive and prejudicial behaviors; one of these places that is of particular interest to Cisneros is the home. As literary critics Deborah L. Madsen and Ramón Saldívar have described, the home can be an oppressive place for Chicanas where they are subjugated to the will of male heads-of-household, {{or in the case of}} their own home, it can be an empowering place where they can act autonomously and express themselves creatively. In The House on Mango Street the young protagonist, Esperanza, longs to have her own house: [...] "Not a flat. Not an apartment in back. Not a man's house. Not a daddy's. A house all my own. With my porch and my pillow, my pretty purple petunias. My books and my stories. My two shoes waiting beside the bed. Nobody to shake a stick at. Nobody's garbage to pick up after." [...] An aspiring writer, Esperanza yearns for [...] "a space for myself to go, clean as paper before the poem." [...] She feels discontented and trapped in her family home, and witnesses other women in the same position. According to Saldívar, Cisneros communicates through this character that a woman needs her own place in order to realize her full potential—a home which is not a site of patriarchal violence, but instead [...] "a site of poetic self-creation." [...] One source of conflict and grief for Cisneros's Chicana characters is that the male-dominated society in which they live denies them this place. Critics such as Jacqueline Doyle and Felicia J. Cruz have compared this theme in Cisneros's work to one of the key concepts in Virginia Woolf's famous essay [...] "A Room of One's Own", that [...] "a woman must have money and a <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own if she is to write fiction," [...] or put another way, [...] "economic security" [...] and personal liberty are necessary for [...] "artistic production." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mrs. Watt was Grimball's mother, so {{running a}} school came {{naturally}} for him. After her husband died, {{she began her}} school in 1931 in {{the depth of the}} Great Depression. Her first classes were held in the dining <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> Broad Street home, but she had a small classroom building constructed at the rear of her property. The reputation of her school grew among her neighbors and among those living south of Broad Street. Many of her graduates went on to the Gaud School, particularly after Grimball became headmaster there. Most of the children walked to school and then walked home for the traditional 2:00p.m. dinner. It was a homey and welcoming school and very “Charlestonian.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Having been home-schooled {{for most}} {{part of her}} childhood, mostly in English {{classics}} and Victorian literature, Woolf began writing professionally in 1900. During the interwar period, Woolf was a significant figure in London literary society and a central figure in the influential Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals. She published her first novel titled The Voyage Out in 1915, through the Hogarth Press, a publishing house that she established with her husband, Leonard Woolf. Her best-known works include the novels Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927) and [...] (1928), and the book-length essay A Room of One's Own (1929), with its dictum, [...] "A woman must have money and a <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own if she is to write fiction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite her {{part-time}} employment (during meal times), Polly frequently is saddled {{with many other}} duties, including manager in [...] "The Germans" [...] when Sybil and Basil are incapacitated. In the first series, Polly {{is said to be}} an art student who, according to Basil, has spent three years at college. In [...] "Gourmet Night", she is seen to draw a sketch (presumably an impressionistic caricature) of Basil, which everyone but Basil immediately recognises. Polly is not referred to as a student in the second series, although in both series she is shown to have a flair for languages, displaying ability in both Spanish and German. In [...] "The Germans", Basil alludes to Polly's polyglot inclination by saying that she does her work [...] "while learning two Oriental languages." [...] Like Manuel, she has a <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own at the hotel.|$|E
2500|$|They {{shared a}} home and were {{constant}} companions while Fitzgerald was still married to his wife Zelda, who was institutionalized in an asylum. Nonetheless, Graham protested her description as his [...] "mistress" [...] in her book The Rest of the Story {{on the basis that}} she was [...] "a woman who loved Scott Fitzgerald for better or worse until he died." [...] It was she who found his body in 1940 in the living <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> West Hollywood, California, apartment, where he had died of a heart attack. They had been together only three and a half years, but her daughter reports that Graham [...] "never really got over him." [...] During those three years, Scott outlined an educational [...] "curriculum" [...] for her and guided her through it, which she later wrote about in detail in A College of One. Graham also later wrote of her years spent with Fitzgerald in the 1958 book Beloved Infidel, which was later adapted as a movie. Upon Fitzgerald's death, seeking a respite from the social demands and frantic pace of her life, Graham arranged for an assignment as a foreign correspondent in NANA's London bureau. This afforded her the opportunity to demonstrate her abilities as a serious journalist. Her first major story from the UK was an in-depth interview with George Bernard Shaw, and she later filed another with Winston Churchill. Her brief respite from Hollywood lasted until the conclusion of World War II.|$|E

2500|$|Nearing her term, the Duchess of Berry still {{played a}} {{lead role in}} the [...] "little suppers" [...] of the Regent, freely indulging in strong drink. On 2 April 1719, after four days of gruesome labor, she was {{delivered}} of a baby girl. According to Saint-Simon the father was her lieutenant of the guards, Sicaire Antonin Armand Auguste Nicolas d'Aydie, the Chevalier de Rion. The princess nearly died during childbirth, shut {{up in a small}} <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> Luxembourg palace. The curé of Saint-Sulpice (Paris) church, Jean-Baptiste Languet de Gergy refused to give her the absolution or to let anyone else administer her the sacraments unless she would expel her paramour from the palace. The Regent tried in vain convincing the irate curé to attend his suffering daughter. But the [...] "illustrious sinner" [...] put an end to Languet's vigil by finally giving birth. According to Saint-Simon, the Duchess of Berry secretly married Rion a few days later hoping thereby to lessen the public scandal caused by her confinement and the refusal of the Church to administer her the sacraments. The means adopted by the princess to conceal her delivery ended in her death. Her health fatally undermined by her harrowing lying-in, she left Paris for her Château de Meudon where she gave a reception in honour of her father who did not approve of her marriage to Rion and had sent him away from Paris. She had not recovered from her horrendous childbirth and this evening reception at which she caught a chill severely affected her health.|$|E
