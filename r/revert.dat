5|$|A {{city can}} be created from a town by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 39 of The Cities Act {{if it has a}} {{population}} of 5,000 or more and the change in status is requested by the town council. A city does not automatically <b>revert</b> to town status if the population drops below 5,000; this only occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote to <b>revert</b> to town status, or the minister is of the opinion that the reversion to town status is in the public interest. Melville retains its city status despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Although the Act of 1975 had {{specified}} that {{a portion of}} the profits from land sales be used to maintain the remaining cemetery, little restoration work was done and the cemetery continued to <b>revert</b> to wilderness.

40|$|Tissues of cytoplasmic male sterile, maintainer, restorer, and {{restored}} lines, and sterile plants which <b>reverted</b> to fertility in Vicia faba {{were examined in}} ultrathin sections. Cytoplasmic spherical bodies (CSB), ca. 70 nm in diameter, were observed in tissues of all sterile plants but not in tissues of maintainer, restorer or restored sterile plants. No CSB were observed in a <b>reverted</b> fertile branch of a tiller-sterile plant, nor in 5 of 6 <b>reverted</b> fertile plants. One <b>reverted</b> fertile plant contained CSB in ovules. It is proposed that the CSB are the sites of, or possibly, products of, sterility factors in Vicia faba...|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} shown that the reverse α–γ {{transformation}} by the diffusion mechanism in the Fe– 22.7  wt.% Ni– 0.58  wt.% С alloy gives rise to the formation of complex grain structure of <b>reverted</b> austenite. The diffraction pattern of the <b>reverted</b> austenite has not demonstrated signs of internal stress. The half-width of diffraction peaks of the <b>reverted</b> austenite was significantly smaller than that of the initial austenite. The <b>reverted</b> austenite grains formed in the course of α–γ transformation displayed different orientations and sizes including nanoscale ones. They also possessed significant concentration inhomogeneity characterized by continuous change of nickel concentration in the whole range of its values.|$|R
5|$|Breeding {{of animals}} and plants showed related {{varieties}} varying in similar ways, or tending to <b>revert</b> to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Lee {{bought the}} rights to the San Francisco 49ers {{football}} stadium, which was renamed to Monster Park. Citizens and local government protested that a public facility adopted a corporate name and a local ballot was passed to <b>revert</b> the stadium name after the four-year deal with Monster expired. The sponsorship was partially contentious due to a recent layoff of 120 local employees.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Biman {{went through}} a {{rebranding}} exercise and unveiled a new logo and livery, designed by Teague, which was applied to its leased Boeing 777 and 737 aircraft. However, following change of government, Biman was forced to <b>revert</b> to the original branding as the new brand image was not endorsed by the incoming government. The carrier has adopted a new, more modern revised version of its livery, that {{was applied to the}} new Boeing 777-300ERs delivered in late 2011.|$|E
50|$|In 2008 {{the force}} changed uniforms to black combat style {{trousers}} with a polo shirt but <b>reverted</b> {{to the more}} traditional white shirt and tie on a trial basis in November 2012. It has since <b>reverted</b> to the polo shirt.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to a range of}} free-fall nuclear bombs, later Victor B.2s operated as missile carriers for standoff nuclear missiles such as Blue Steel; it had been intended for the American Skybolt missile to be introduced; however, development of Skybolt was cancelled. Target information for Blue Steel could be input during flight, as well in advance of the mission. It was reported that, with intensive work, a B.2 missile carrier could <b>revert</b> to carrying free-fall nuclear weapons or conventional munitions within 30 hours.|$|E
5|$|Kauri gum is a fossilised resin detracted from kauri trees (Agathis australis), {{which is}} made into crafts such as jewellery. Kauri forests once covered much of the North Island of New Zealand, before Māori and European {{settlers}} caused deforestation, causing several areas to <b>revert</b> to sand dunes, scrubs, and swamps. Even afterward, ancient kauri fields continued to provide a source for the gum and the remaining forests.|$|E
5|$|Later, it was {{announced}} that should a sequel or reboot not start filming by October 10, 2012, the rights to the Daredevil franchise would <b>revert</b> from Fox back to Marvel. In early August 2012, Fox scrambled to find a replacement for David Slade, who dropped out of the director's chair due to scheduling conflicts. The studio briefly met with Joe Carnahan, for the job—however, Carnahan said on Twitter that his pitch, described as a hard-boiled '70s thriller, had gone up in smoke. Several sources commented that Fox had given up on the reboot, and were prepared to let the rights <b>revert</b> to Marvel and their parent company, The Walt Disney Company. On April 23, 2013, Kevin Feige confirmed that the rights for Daredevil returned to Marvel Studios and Disney, opening the possibility of including the character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That speculation was confirmed with the announcement of an original Netflix Daredevil television series, which premiered on the streaming service in April 2015, with English actor Charlie Cox in the title role.|$|E
50|$|The {{club was}} not {{loyal to the}} stripes for long, and in 1982 <b>reverted</b> to a blue shirt, then used a blue body with amber sleeves, later <b>reverting</b> to an amber body with blue sleeves. In 1987 the shirts radically changed to white shirts for four seasons before <b>reverting</b> to stripes in 1991-92. After a {{flamboyant}} abstract pattern on the shirts in 1992-93, Shrewsbury's kits have stayed mostly blue, with amber stripe(s) of some description evident since 1999.|$|R
50|$|Squad numbers became {{optional}} in {{the three}} divisions of The Football League at the same time, but only 10 out of 70 clubs utilized them. One of those clubs, Brighton & Hove Albion, issued 25 players with squad numbers but <b>reverted</b> to traditional 1-11 numbering halfway through the season. In the Premier League, Arsenal temporarily <b>reverted</b> to the old system halfway through that same season, but <b>reverted</b> to the new numbering system for the following campaign.|$|R

5|$|Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{arrives at}} the crime scene and meets NOPD detective Franklin Potter, who has called her in out of his belief that the murders are related to satanism.

As she is leaving, she witnesses one of the bodies carbonize into a charred corpse in front of her, only to have it <b>revert</b> to normal.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 2016, it was {{announced}} that following the termination of Jarrold as the stand's sponsor, the stand would <b>revert</b> to its historical name of the South Stand. Irish coffee company The Galway Roast were announced as the stand's new sponsors, which would be officially called The South Stand sponsored by The Galway Roast. On 2 November 2016, the club announced that the sponsorship deal with The Galway Roast had been terminated and the stand would once again simply be known as The South Stand.|$|E
5|$|The Chalk River reactor {{was shut}} down for {{maintenance}} in August 2009, and reopened in August 2010. The Petten reactor had a 6-month scheduled maintenance shutdown on Friday, February 19, 2010, and reopened September 2010. With millions of procedures relying on technetium-99m every year, the low supply has left a gap, leaving some practitioners to <b>revert</b> to techniques not used for 20 years. Somewhat allaying this issue is an announcement from the Polish Maria research reactor that they have developed a technique to isolate technetium.|$|E

Throughout the former East Germany, many schools and institutions bearing Egon Schultz’s name <b>reverted</b> to their original names.|$|R
