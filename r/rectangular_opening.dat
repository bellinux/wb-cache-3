25|$|On March 4, 1921, the United States Congress {{approved}} the burial of an unidentified American serviceman from World War I {{in the plaza}} of the new Memorial Amphitheater. On November 11, 1921, the unknown soldier brought back from France was interred below a three-level marble tomb. The bottom two levels are six marble sections each and the top at least nine blocks with a <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening</b> {{in the center of}} each level through which the unknown remains were placed through the tomb and into the ground below. A stone, rather than marble, slab covers the <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening.</b>|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{a simple}} steel tube {{structure}} in {{the nose of the}} fuselage was used to support the engine; detachable panels across the cowling provided access to most of the engine's areas for inspection or adjustment purposes. Installed underneath the fuselage, the liquid-cooled radiator has a <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening</b> to its aft; this is covered by a hinged flap via which the pilot was able to actively vary the cooling level. An atypical feature for the era was the use of tungum pipes throughout the cooling system.|$|E
25|$|The old World War II {{power house}} is a bunker-like structure, built of {{reinforced}} concrete with a small extension to the east, which was at some point used as a henhouse. The main section roof is covered with asphalt, and the extension has a pitched galvanised iron gable roof. One <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening</b> is in the main section {{and one in the}} extension. The garage and the workshop are timber framed and fibro clad, with a gable roofs of corrugated fibro cement with metal gutters and downpipes. They have timber doors, timber floors and timber-framed louvre windows.|$|E
30|$|<b>Rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> {{were found}} to be very {{critical}} as they show very high stress concentration around the corner regions. It is also seen that the deformations of the <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> are large compared to the other type of web <b>openings.</b> The <b>rectangular</b> web <b>openings</b> of 0.75 d have a very high stress intensity compared to the other depth of openings such as 0.62 d and 0.50 d.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Reinforced {{concrete}} coupled {{walls are}} cantilevered shear walls joined by coupling beams {{and are used}} in high-rise apartment for many years. <b>Rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> {{are the most common}} shape of openings used in shear wall in order to provide doors, windows, entrance to car park areas and elevators or staircases. Behavior of coupling beams affect the strength of coupled walls. This research suggests adding haunches to the corners of <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> and form octagonal openings as a method to increase the strength of coupling beams. The experimental results of shear wall with single band of <b>rectangular</b> and octagonal <b>openings</b> are compared in terms of behavior of coupling beams under cyclic load. The results demonstrate that the coupling beams in shear wall with octagonal openings are stronger than coupling beams in shear wall with <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first group}} is {{characterized}} by tunnels with <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> which are often on different levels, connected by ladders and steps, with houses located on the upper levels and animal shelters in the lower ones.|$|R
25|$|The 55 foot (16.8 m) {{diameter}} Gerald Harbach Round Barn stands upon a {{poured concrete}} foundation near the unincorporated community of Eleroy in Stephenson County, Illinois, United States. The wood sided exterior has been covered in asphalt since the building's construction. The barn's main, ground level entrance, {{is in the}} west quadrant and over the entrance is the loft door which is a <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening</b> in the ceiling. Each rafter of the single hip roof is braced with a nailed beam four feet (1.2 m) above and four feet (1.2 m) below, on the opposite side, the roof hip. In addition, there are beams nailed diagonally between the studs in the loft to brace the building against strong winds. The roof exterior is capped with a short cupola.|$|E
500|$|As for the Kinetoscope itself, {{there is}} a {{significant}} disagreement over the location of the shutter providing the crucial intermittent visibility effect. According to a report by inventor Herman Casler described as [...] "authoritative" [...] by Hendricks, who personally examined five of the six still-extant first-generation devices, [...] "Just above the film,...a shutter wheel having five spokes and a very small <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening</b> in the rim [...] directly over the film. An incandescent lamp...is placed below the film...and the light passes up through the film, shutter opening, and magnifying lens...to the eye of the observer placed at the opening {{in the top of the}} case." [...] Robinson, on the other hand, says the shutter—which he agrees has only a single slit—is positioned lower, [...] "between the lamp and film". The Casler–Hendricks description is supported by the diagrams of the Kinetoscope that accompany the 1891 patent application, in particular, diagram 2. A side view, it does not illustrate the shutter, but it shows the impossibility of it fitting between the lamp and the film without a major redesign and indicates a space that seems suitable for it between the film and the lens. Robinson's description, however, is supported by a photograph of a Kinetoscope interior that appears in Hendricks's own book.|$|E
500|$|The bridge {{crossing}} the lake dates from about 1843, and is constructed in brick with stone dressings. [...] It consists of five segmental arches, with abutments running {{down to the}} banks. [...] The arches have rusticated voussoirs and keystones, and above the voussoirs are hood moulds. [...] Between the arches are brick pilasters. Along {{the top of the}} bridge is a stone balustrade with square piers. [...] Also in the grounds is an icehouse dating from the 18th or early 19thcentury. [...] It is built in brick and consists of a circular domed chamber. [...] From the arched entrance a barrel vaulted passage leads through a <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening</b> into the chamber. [...] Also in the grounds is a summer house that was formerly the bell turret of the chapel. [...] It carries a gold flag with the date 1722. [...] The lodge at the north entrance to the grounds was designed by Blore and dates from about 1843. [...] It is built in brick with ashlar dressings and has a felt roof. [...] The lodge consists of a three-storey square tower containing two-light mullioned windows. [...] At the top of the tower is an entablature with a panelled parapet and pierced ogee finials on the corners. [...] The roof is ogee-shaped with a ball finial and a flagpole.|$|E
50|$|The second {{tower in}} the {{northwest}} stood 15 meters and was embattled. It has a ground floor with a dungeon. The walls connecting both towers are pierced with <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings,</b> and contained at least two rooms.|$|R
5000|$|Built from February 1947. Top {{third body}} panel now had {{full-length}} [...] "chicken wire". Long rear vent panel. Center third body panel now had two portholes; area between covered with chicken wire, over 4 smaller <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Built from March 1948. (Surviving F3's former BAR 42,44,46 {{are still}} Phase 2 and {{were built in}} MAY 1948) Center third body panel now has no chicken wire between the portholes; the four <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> now have louvres.|$|R
2500|$|Approximately 10million bricks {{were needed}} to build the viaduct. [...] The {{brickwork}} is red and brown, with yellow brick dressings. [...] The wartime reconstruction used blue brick, a darker type often used for heavy-duty construction. [...] The 26narrower arches are round-headed, whereas the wider span across Preston Road is elliptical. [...] Each pier has a long, <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening</b> on each inner side, with rounded arches {{at the top and}} bottom. [...] Running {{along the top of the}} viaduct on both sides is a balustrade with stone balusters.|$|E
50|$|The Shiva temple is {{also built}} on a square platform. Its {{entrance}} is a recessed round arch with faint cusps and a <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening</b> to the north.|$|E
50|$|The cave is only {{large enough}} for a few people and the regular lines of the <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening</b> add {{emphasis}} to its artificial origin or creation from a pre-existing cavity.|$|E
40|$|In non-steel {{manufacturing}} {{countries like}} Sri Lanka, where {{the cost of}} heavy rolled steel sections are very high, composite floor trusses tend to provide an economical solution in achieving moderate spans {{in the range of}} 8 m- 12 m. A high degree of service integration can be provided in these floor systems by allowing <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings,</b> as often preferred in constructing high-rise buildings. However, allowance of <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> in the web creates additional local moments in the comers of the openings, which are generally known as "vierendeel" moments and render the composite truss statically indeterminate. Failure to account for these vierendeel moments in composite floor structures often leads to undesirable cracking in the concrete floor slab...|$|R
25|$|The {{justification}} vise {{holds the}} assembled line against {{the face of}} the mold disk. The mold disk has <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> which correspond to the width and thickness of the slugs (cast lines) to be made. Mold liners fit into these openings for specific slug dimensions.|$|R
50|$|An author {{described}} it as “very beautiful and of very good condition.” When looking at the complex of church and convent, one is stuck by {{the impression that the}} round and <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> are capriciously aligned. This makes the façade both interesting and unique.|$|R
50|$|The long {{elevation}} to {{the rear}} (southwest) accommodates a <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening</b> cut into the slabs midway along the elevation. A hinged timber framed and boarded window is fitted to this opening.|$|E

50|$|Screen Mesh- Just like thread is woven {{together}} to create cloth, metal wire can be woven to create a metal cloth. Screen Mesh has evolved over many years of competitive screen manufacturing resulting in very thin yet strong cloth designed to maximize screen life and conductance {{as well as to}} provide a consistent cut point. To increase the conductance of a mesh screen you have to minimize the amount of material in the way, this is done by either reducing the wire diameter or weaving the cloth to produce <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings.</b> <b>Rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> increase the screens conductance while minimizing the effect on its cut point where as square openings provide a more consistent cut point but offer a lower conductance.|$|R
50|$|Essentially rectangular, {{the well}} {{proportioned}} original building measured 90.0 feet wide by 57.5 feet deep in plan. The original treatment {{on the two}} identical end elevations is restrained compared to the front. The horizontal string courses, brick rustication, cornice and parapet detailing continues, but the pilasters and arched openings are omitted in favor of four evenly spaced <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> in a flat wall, (the end walls of the 1939 addition are recessed from the original.) The original rear (now light-well) elevation reflected {{the organization of the}} front and also its interior functions. The central portion of the facade was defined by symmetrically flanking narrow bays that were slightly recessed. The first story had five large glazed <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> in the rusticated brick which provided north light to the postal workroom. A protruding mail vestibule/loading dock occupied the center bay. At the second story, there were three large arched glazed openings with fan lights providing light to the courtroom. These were flanked by tall <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> with circular attic windows directly above. Due to the courtroom height, the third story windows were only located at the flanking bays. Stone, brick, and balcony detailing continued to the rear elevation. Similar to the end elevations, the pilasters were omitted from the north facade.|$|R
50|$|The freight pilot curved inward {{a little}} way below {{the bottom of the}} nose before sloping out again, to give more {{clearance}} to the coupler and hoses. The coupler wasfixed and protruded through a <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening</b> in the pilot.|$|E
5000|$|The front part, {{in various}} configurations, is {{consistently}} low and brings air needed for cooling through a <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening</b> smoothed or at semicircle. Conversely tail, {{which has a}} lower door to enter the differential is high, voluminous and rounded.|$|E
50|$|The west {{elevation}} {{has a large}} <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening</b> {{through which}} the drums of the winders are visible. Some corrugated iron sheeting {{to the left of}} this opening is missing. To the right, there is a narrow skillion roofed, corrugated iron extension.|$|E
50|$|For much {{of their}} length, the {{platforms}} are covered by a concrete canopy supported by steel beams. Several years ago the station was flooded and to prevent future floods the original barred <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> in the platforms walls were filled in and covered with brick tiles.|$|R

50|$|The Vierendeel truss, unlike common {{pin-jointed}} trusses, imposes significant bending forces {{upon its}} members — but {{this in turn}} allows the elimination of many diagonal elements. It is a structure where the members are not triangulated but form <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings,</b> and is a frame with fixed joints {{that are capable of}} transferring and resisting bending moments. While rare as a bridge type due to higher costs compared to a triangulated truss, it is commonly employed in modern building construction as it allows the resolution of gross shear forces against the frame elements while retaining <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> between columns. This is advantageous both in allowing flexibility {{in the use of the}} building space and freedom in selection of the building's outer curtain wall, which affects both interior and exterior styling aspects.|$|R
50|$|The cathedral's western façade {{was never}} finished. When being {{restored}} in the 19th and 20th centuries, the Gothic {{window of the}} façade was rebuilt, as it had previously been substituted by a simple <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening.</b> The façade also features a portico and clock-tower, which date from the 18th century.|$|E
50|$|A simple zograscope can be {{built from}} a frame (by cutting a <b>rectangular</b> <b>opening</b> {{in the bottom of}} a {{cardboard}} box) and placing in the frame a large, magnifying, fresnel lens available from stationery stores. When this is placed over a computer monitor displaying a photograph of a natural scene, the depicted depth will be enhanced.|$|E
50|$|The ploughbeam is {{made from}} a single oak branch {{approximately}} 3 m long. The ploughshare originally measured about 60 cm.

50|$|The {{treatment}} of side and rear elevations is more modest, but with fine detailing. The walls are unrendered brickwork with <b>rectangular</b> <b>openings</b> to ground and first floors, and the verandahs have paired timber posts with timber valances and capitals, boarded timber sunscreens, and cast iron balustrades. The side verandahs are partially enclosed.|$|R
50|$|The {{keystone}} {{is often}} decorated or enlarged.
