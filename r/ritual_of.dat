5|$|In 597, a Benedictine monk {{had been}} sent by Pope GregoryI to start {{converting}} Pagan England to Christianity. The monk, Augustine, became the first Archbishop of Canterbury. Within two centuries, the <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> anointing monarchs with holy oil and crowning them (initially with helmets) in a Christian ceremony had been established, and regalia took on a religious identity. There was still no permanent set of coronation regalia; each monarch generally had a new set made, with {{which he or she}} was usually buried upon death.|$|E

5|$|Pilgrims {{must leave}} Arafat for Muzdalifah after sunset without praying maghrib (evening) prayer at Arafat. Muzdalifah {{is an area}} between Arafat and Mina.

5|$|The Hajj is {{associated}} with the life of Islamic prophet Muhammad from the 7th century, but the <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> pilgrimage to Mecca is considered by Muslims to stretch back thousands of years to the time of Abraham. During Hajj, pilgrims join processions {{of hundreds of thousands of}} people, who simultaneously converge on Mecca for the week of the Hajj, and perform a series of rituals: each person walks counter-clockwise seven times around the Kaaba (the cube-shaped building and the direction of prayer for the Muslims), runs back and forth between the hills of Safa and Marwah, drinks from the Zamzam Well, goes to the plains of Mount Arafat to stand in vigil, spends a night in the plain of Muzdalifa, and performs symbolic stoning of the devil by throwing stones at three pillars. The pilgrims then shave their heads, perform a <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> animal sacrifice, and celebrate the three-day global festival of Eid al-Adha.|$|E
5|$|The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn The {{membership}} and <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn were strongly linked to Freemasonry, but membership {{was open to}} non-masons and to women.

5|$|An {{important}} feature that distinguished Maqam al-Khawwas from the Deir Ghassaneh mosque {{was that it}} acted primarily as a women's domain whereas the mosque had largely been a male domain. In the pre-British Mandate era, it was frequented by women {{on a daily basis}} and during a seasonal pilgrimage for women known as mawsim al-banat. During this pilgrimage, which coincided with the Nabi Salih pilgrimage, a largely male affair, large groups of women and children from the villages of Bani Zeid would visit the Khawwas mausoleum to celebrate festivities, socialize with other women and pray. According to Palestinian architecture expert Suad Amiry, Maqam al-Khawwas's isolation and the <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> having to travel uphill to reach the sanctuary added to the tranquil feeling of the visit.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans was a {{guest in}} a Serbian highlander family {{in the region of}} Krivošije, Montenegrin Littoral. Analyzing the practices, he {{concluded}} that the badnjak customs were connected with ancestor worship. The lighting of the log on the ognjište could be seen as a solemn annual rekindling of the sacred hearth fire, regarded as the center of the family life and the seat of the ancestors. The belief that ancestral spirits dwell in the domestic hearth was attested among Slavic and other peoples. Fire worship in the old Slavic religion was mostly transformed into the cult of domestic fire, and thus joined with ancestor worship. A trace of sacrifice to the fire is the coin thrown into it by the polaznik after the <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> making sparks fly from the badnjak.|$|E
5|$|As {{a tribute}} to his then-pregnant wife, Ilary Blasi, Totti imitated a {{childbirth}} scene by stuffing the ball under his shirt and {{lying on his back}} while his teammates extracted the ball.

Blasi has revealed that Totti also sucks his thumb in dedication to her and not just for their children. On 11 January 2015, Totti scored twice against Lazio in the Derby della Capitale as Roma came back from 2–0 down; he then took a selfie with Roma fans.|$|E
5|$|English Freemasonry {{spread to}} France in the 1720s, first as lodges of expatriates and exiled Jacobites, {{and then as}} distinctively French lodges which still follow the <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> the Moderns. From France and England, Freemasonry spread to most of Continental Europe {{during the course of}} the 18th century. The Grande Loge de France formed under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Clermont, who {{exercised}} only nominal authority. His successor, the Duke of Orléans, reconstituted the central body as the Grand Orient de France in 1773. Briefly eclipsed during the French Revolution, French Freemasonry continued to grow in the next century.|$|E

Revie and Bremner had a strong bond of trust, which was why the manager gave him the captaincy at such a young age. Leeds finished second in the league in the 1965–66 campaign to Liverpool, who had finished six points clear at the top.|$|E
5|$|In Pali-Pember, the <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> the {{marriage}} of Khandoba with Mhalsa is annually performed. Turmeric is offered to the deities.

These are the Dasara festival at Devaragudda, and an eleven-day festival in Magha month (February–March) in Mailar, Bellary district. Both festivals have enactments of the battle between Mailar and the demons Mani-Malla. Chaitra Purnima (full-moon day) is also considered auspicious. In general, Sundays, associated with the sun-god, are considered as considered auspicious for Khandoba worship.|$|E
