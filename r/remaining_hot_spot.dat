5000|$|On July 9, {{the fire}} grew to over 10000 acre and began moving towards lightly {{populated}} areas outside of Kasilof and Soldotna. More resources {{were ordered to}} protect these areas. By June 11, over 400 persons were fighting the fire, and hotshot crews and bulldozers were utilized to create fire breaks. Air tankers and helicopters were also used to dump water and fire retardant near homes threatened by the fire. A temporary [...] "tent city" [...] was established at Skyview High School to house firefighters and support staff, and a no fly zone was established around the fire area. Smoke from the fire and others blazing simultaneously in Interior Alaska contributed to a visible haze of smoke over Anchorage and much of south-central Alaska. Fire managers began to take crews off the fire and reassign them after light but sustained rain fell on the fire for several days starting on July 18.

Based on kernel density smoothing for a definition of micro-place crime <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> we replicate past work {{on the existence of}} “chronic” <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> but then with such <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> accounted for introduce “temporary” <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Results: Chronic <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> are good targets for prevention. They are easily identified and they tend to persist. Temporary <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> however, predominantly last only one month. Thus the common practice of identifying <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> using a short time window of crime data and assuming that the resulting <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> will persist is ineffective for temporary <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Instead it is necessary to forecast the emergence of temporary <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> to prevent their crimes.

Chronic <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> are relatively easy targets for police whereas temporary <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> require forecasting methods not commonly in use by police.

40|$|Abstract Background Meiotic {{recombination}} {{events have}} been found to concentrate in 1 – 2. 5 kilo base regions, but these recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> do not share a consensus sequence and why they occur at specific sites is not fully understood. Some previous evidence suggests that poly-purine/poly-pyrimidine (poly-pu/py) tracts (PPTs), a class of sequence with distinctive biochemical properties, could be involved in recombination, but no general association of PPTs with meiotic recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> has previously been reported. Results We used computational methods to investigate in detail the relationship between PPTs and <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> We show statistical associations of PPT frequency with <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of meiotic recombination initiating lesions, double-strand breaks, in the genome of the yeast S. cerevisiae and with experimentally well characterized human meiotic recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Supporting a possible role of poly-pu/py-rich sequences in <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> recombination, we also found that all three single nucleotide polymorphisms previously shown to be associated with human <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> activity changes occur within sequence contexts of 14 bp or longer that are 85 % or more poly-pu/py and at least 70 % G/C. These polymorphisms are all close to the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> mid points. Comparing the sequences of experimentally characterized human <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> with the orthologous regions of the chimpanzee genome previously shown not to contain <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> we found that in all five cases in which comparisons for the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> central regions are possible with publicly available sequence data, there are differences near the human <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> mid points within sequences 14 bp or longer consisting of more than 80 % poly-pu/py and at least 50 % G/C. Conclusion Our results, along with previous evidence for the unique biochemical properties and recombination-stimulating potential of poly-pu/py-rich sequences, suggest that the possible functional involvement of this type of sequence in meiotic recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> deserves further experimental exploration. </p...|$|R

AIMS: To develop and test an automated method for microvessel counting and objective selection of the <b>hot</b> <b>spot,</b> based on image processing of whole sections, and to compare this with manual selection of a <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> and counting of microvessels. METHODS: Microvessels were stained by CD 31 immunohistochemistry in 10 cases of invasive breast cancer. The number of microvessels was counted manually in a subjectively selected <b>hot</b> <b>spot,</b> {{and also in the}} same complete tumour sections by interactive and automated image processing methods. An algorithm identified the <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> from microvessel maps of the whole tumour section. RESULTS: No significant difference in manual microvessel counts was found between two observers within the same <b>hot</b> <b>spot,</b> and counts were significantly correlated. However, when the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> was reselected, significantly different results were found between repeated counts by the same observer. Counting all microvessels manually within the entire tumour section resulted in significantly different <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> than manual counts in selected <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> by the same observer. Within the entire tumour section {{no significant differences were found}} between the <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of the manual and automated methods using an automated microscope. The <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> was found using an eight connective path search algorithm, was located at or near the border of the tumour, and (depending on the size of the <b>hot</b> <b>spot)</b> did not always contain the field with the largest number of microvessels. CONCLUSIONS: The automated counting of microvessels is preferable to the manual method because of the reduction in measurement time when the complete tumour is scanned, the greater accuracy and objectivity of <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> selection, and the possibility of visual inspection and relocation of each measurement field afterwards...|$|R

40|$|The optimal feed {{parameters}} of the generators for a complex-phased hyperthermia array system consisting of 4, 8 or even more applicators cannot be found using only the expertise of the treatment staff or using the limited amount of field and temperature data obtained during treatment. A number of strategies have been proposed {{to help us with}} the task to optimise the hyperthermia treatment, including several strategies specifically addressing the occurrence of <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Each of the latter strategies strongly relies on the specification of the potential <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> This specification is either based on anatomy or the selection of an arbitrary number of potential <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Therefore it is not guaranteed that all potential <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> are included. This paper introduces a procedure for the delineation and visualisation of potential (SAR) <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> The potential <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> are delineated by selecting those points for which the maximal SAR exceeds a specific SAR selection level. This SAR selection level is defined relative to the highest achievable SAR in the target volume for a certain fixed heating power. A larger number of potential <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> and <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of larger size are delineated if the selection level is decreased. Although the procedure still includes an arbitrary selection criterion, i. e. the selection level, the selection is solely based on calculated EM-field data. As a result all potential <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> can be delineated a priori. Three different objective functions are applied to maximise the SAR in the target. The first only maximises the SAR in the target volume for a given system power output. The other two intrinsically set a constraint on the set of potential <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> as a whole. Additionally the SAR in each delineated potential <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> separately can be constrained. In two patient cases the SAR in potential <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> can be kept below the selection value applied for delineation of the potential <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> If assessed in terms of constraining the SAR value below the selection level while maximising target heating efficiency the combination of an objective function only maximising the SAR in the target with a separate constraint on each potential <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> appears to be the most efficien...|$|R
