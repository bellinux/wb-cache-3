40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the ethical {{issues raised by}} sex selection for the individual, family and society. Techniques like sperm sorting and preimplantation genetic diagnosis {{have made it possible}} for parents to select the gender of their offspring even before they are born. These new reproductive technologies do raise some important ethical questions for us. This thesis briefly considers the morality of the technology being used to achieve sex selection before going on to discuss if there is anything morally objectionable about sex selection, in and of itself. In this thesis I argue that parents ought not to place value on gender {{when it comes to their}} children since gender is a morally irrelevant factor in the parent-child relationship and parental love should not be conditioned by characteristics like gender. Hence, this preference of theirs regarding sex cannot be justified. I discuss the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduction,</b> how it applies to sex selection and the limits on procreative liberty. I argue that a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduction,</b> reproductive freedom or reproductive autonomy does not entail a right to sex selection. I also discuss how sex selection could impact children, children's right to an open future and make a case for sex selection as a harm to the child. I analyse Kant's `Means and Ends' formula and apply it to sex selection, thus concluding that the choice of a particular trait, like gender by a parent undermines the principle of respect for individuals and thus instrumentalises the value of children for their parents. The thesis also looks at discrimination and the impact of sex selection on women and society. With reference to the current situation in India and China where sex selection has led to horrific consequences I discuss the implications of the current situation for society today.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay {{is to examine the}} {{relation}} between reproductive rights and overpopulation. The main research question is whether the increase of the population size can affect the moral aspects of the reproductive rights. Relying on, and building upon arguments already developed by a number of philosophers, I show that although some restrictions might be justified, these restrictions cannot completely rule out the basic <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Based on this, I then proceed with an overview of the possible solutions. In the subsequent discussion, a one-child-per-couple philosophy stands out as the best option. This would be morally justified according to the initial statements, as well as the most effective alternative when it comes to initiating a significant population decline. The one-child-per-couple philosophy is then contested by several problems that could theoretically arise, but none of these problems are, according to my discussion, strong enough to dispute the positive aspects of the theory. The conclusion of this essay is that we, as a species, have a moral obligation to limit our numbers and that we ought to start acting accordingly...|$|E
40|$|A {{dissertation}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the Bachelor of Laws degreeWomen's rights {{are central to the}} progress of women in social, economic, political and cultural spheres of life. It {{is for this reason that}} these rights have been given special regard at both an international and national levels. Among such women's right is the right to reproduction; a right encompassing a conglomerate of rights such as the right to the highest attainable standard of health and the right to decide the number and spacing of one's children and the right to be free from discrimination. Reproductive rights are further premised on the principle of bodily integrity which enshrines the right of the person to make decisions concerning one's body. Forced and coerced sterilizations involve making a woman permanently unable to bear children without her consent, or with consent obtained under duress or incentive without proper understanding or knowledge of the procedure consequences. This study aims to show how such sterilizations undermine the human dignity of the person and the resultant violation of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduction</b> at both international and national level, more specifically Kenya. The research is a qualitative one based on information from text books, journal articles, news articles and appropriate case law from various jurisdictions. The paper looks to apply its findings to the Kenyan jurisdiction and to propose mechanisms through which reproductive rights within the region can be more strongly protected by reducing the occurrence of harmful practices such as forced and coerced sterilizations...|$|E

25|$|The {{neighbouring}} rights, introduced for {{the first}} time in the 1991 Fundamentals, were much expanded and clarified in the 1993 copyright law. The law covered performances, phonograms, and broadcasts (including cable broadcasts). Visual fixations (videograms) were not covered. Neighbouring rights were, like the copyrights, automatic and not subject to formalities except the observance of any rights of the authors (or performers) of the works performed, recorded, or broadcast. Performers were granted the moral <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> attribution and to the integrity of the work. The exclusive economic rights comprised the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> (re-)perform a performance, including a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be remunerated for any reuses of a performance, and the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>reproduction,</b> recording, distribution, broadcasts, and rebroadcasts of a performance, a phonogram, or a broadcast. Phonogram producers were even granted an exclusive <b>right</b> <b>to</b> adaptations of their recordings, a provision that goes even beyond the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. The 1993 law covered phonograms first published in Russia or created by a Russian person or company, broadcasts of broadcasting organizations having their legal residence in Russia, and performances of Russian artists, as wells as performances first performed in Russia, and also performances recorded or broadcast in Russia, if the record or broadcast was covered by the law.|$|R
