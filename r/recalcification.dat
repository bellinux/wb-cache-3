40|$|Hypercoagulability in {{malignant}} disease can be attributed, in part, to excess generation of tissue factor (thromboplastin) by the monocyte. Incubation of anticoagulated venous blood with endotoxin (a cellular activator) enables {{the generation of}} tissue factor by monocytes. The quantity of this procoagulant generated is determined by a simple <b>recalcification</b> time (a marker for cellular activation).

40|$|Patients, {{suffering}} from severe back pain {{caused by a}} degenerative instability of the lumbar spine, will benefit from surgical treatment. Sufficient decompression of the nervous structures is necessary. Additional fusion techniques can improve the postoperative development of clinical symptoms. Good results are reachable with posterolateral fusion without dorsal instrumentation. There is no evidence for better results with dorsal instrumentation. Nevertheless {{there is a clear}} evolution onto more complex surgical techniques, caused by the higher rates of bony fusion. Solid fusion decreases the risk of secondary surgery. These better results are specifically remarkable in long term course. A solid bone bridge in the intervertebral space is the most important criteria to evaluate the technical results of fusion surgery. In spite of elaboration of surgical procedures in fusion surgery ossification will partially fail. Urist et al reported in the early 60 s about bone growth factors. In the 90 s these factors came first time to clinical use in surgical treatment of pseudarthrotic long bone fractures. In 2002 bone growth factors were admitted by the FDA for spinal surgery. From this time on the usage of rhBMP- 2 und rhBMP- 7 increased fulminantly. In 2006 the application of BMPs reached a 40 % rate in fusion surgery. Review of the literature showed, that the real benefit of use of bone growth factors is limited. Only in cases combining the rhBMP- 2 with the posterolateral fusion technique a higher fusion rate could be reached. There is no evidence for better results using rhBMP- 7. Cause of those facts and knowing the possible complications with osteolytic processes, radiculitis, soft tissue reactions and ectopic ossification the usage of rhBMPs in spinal surgery should be submitted to an ongoing discussion. We analysed the one year follow up of 17 patients treated with lumbar spinal fusion in PLIF-technique with rhBMP- 2 filled cages. The special interest focused on the radiological results showing the processes of ossification in the disc space. We controlled the processes with CT scans after 3 and 6 months. In 82, 4 % we saw an osteolytic reaction in the bony endplates of the vertebral bodies. <b>Recalcifications</b> happens in all cases within the control period. After 6 months a solid fusion was reached in 16 of 17 patients (94, 1 %) – after 12 months all patients showed a segmental bone fusion. Only in one case an ectopic ossification was visible, but without any space requirering. We could neither remark any inflammatic reactions nor wound healing disorders. Within the period of the osteolytic reaction no corresponding clinical symptoms could be detected. As an result we ascertain, that the use of rhBMP- 2 would only in special cases be beneficial. There are special risks of complications. Cause of the meanwhile great number of clinical trials regarding the use of BMPs feasibility and security are proven. But the most essential fact in the application of BMPs is that in spite of all medical investigations we do not know the concrete processes of ossification and the influence of bone growth factors in situ. Also we do not know the concrete necessary dosage of BMPs. Further the high costs of available BMP products are problematically for an „all day application“. Because of {{that it has to be}} discussed, whether the small amount of improvement of fusion rate is reason enough for a primary and general use of rhBMP- 2 in spinal fusion surgery.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies {{have been}} {{performed}} on human fresh, liquid-preserved, and cryopreserved platelets (PLTs) to assess PLT-adhesive surface receptors, PLT membrane procoagulant activity, PLT aggregation, and thromboxane production. Lyophilization has been developed as a method to preserve PLTs. This study was performed to evaluate these measurements on human and baboon fresh and lyophilized reconstituted PLTs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In both human and baboon fresh and lyophilized PLTs, aggregation response and PLT production of thromboxane A 2 were measured after stimulation, and PLT surface markers P-selectin, glycoprotein (GP) Ib, GPIIb-IIIa, and factor (F) V were measured before and after stimulation. RESULTS: Fresh PLTs responded to the dual agonists arachidonic acid and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to aggregate and produce thromboxane A 2, and in both the PLT surface markers P-selectin and GPIIb-IIIa increased and GPIb decreased after stimulation. Neither human nor baboon lyophilized reconstituted PLTs aggregated to dual agonists, and neither produced thromboxane A 2, increased PLT surface markers P-selectin or GPIIb-IIIa, or decreased PLT GPIb after stimulation. Nevertheless, after <b>recalcification</b> the lyophilized reconstituted PLTs accumulated FV to a significantly greater degree than fresh PLTs. CONCLUSIONS: Lyophilized reconstituted PLTs exhibited modification of the PLT membrane that interfered with aggregation and thromboxane production, prevented increases in PLT P-selectin and GPIIb-IIIa and decreases in GPIb after stimulation, and increased FV accumulation after <b>recalcification.</b> The in vitro data suggest that lyophilized PLTs may have reduced in vivo survival.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{concurrent}} production of macrophage agglutination factor (MAggF) and procoagulant activity by antigen-stimulated human blood mononuclear cells to {{gain insight into}} biochemical mechanisms underlying delayed hypersensitivity inflammatory reactions. After stimulation of cells from tuberculin-sensitive donors with tuberculin, MAggF was present in culture supernatants while {{the overwhelming majority of}} procoagulant activity remained cell-associated. Neither MAggF nor procoagulant activity was found in reconstituted control cultures, nor in tuberculin-stimulated cultures of non-sensitive cells. Concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide elicited both activities from cultured mononuclear cells, regardless of donor sensitivity. Human MAggF bound to insolubilized gelatin, heparin and a monoclonal anti-fibronectin (FN) antibody, and its activity was inhibited by another monoclonal antibody directed against the gelatin-binding domain of FN. Treatment of indicator peritoneal exudate cells with monoclonal anti-FN receptor antibody inhibited their response to human MAggF. These results suggest that human MAggF, like the analogous guinea-pig activity, is FN-associated. Antigen-elicited procoagulant activity shortened the <b>recalcification</b> time of normal, factor VII- and factor IX-deficient plasma, partially corrected prothrombin times of factor VII-deficient plasma, had no effect on <b>recalcification</b> and prothrombin items of factor X- and factor V-deficient plasma, and was inhibited by specific anti-factor VII antibody. Thus, human mononuclear cell procoagulant consists of both tissue factor and factor VII, whether it is induced by antigen or mitogen.

Protein S was an effective cofactor to APC in Al(OH) 3 -adsorbed plasma, but was significantly less active in normal plasma. Analysis {{of the difference in}} the two plasmas revealed that normal plasma contained an inhibitor to the anticoagulant activity of protein S that was removed by Al(OH) 3 adsorption. Purification of this inhibitory activity demonstrated that it was mediated by the vitamin K-dependent protein, prothrombin. Prothrombin purified by conventional techniques caused immediate, dose-dependent inhibition of the cofactor activity of protein S in the presence of phospholipids or platelets, but had no effect on the anticoagulant activity of APC. The inhibition was demonstrable using a Factor Xa <b>recalcification</b> time, and studies of the rates of inactivation of purified Factor Va. Increasing concentrations of protein S overcame the inhibition by prothrombin and kinetic analysis of the interaction demonstrated that prothrombin acted as a competitive inhibitor to protein S. Immunoabsorption of prothrombin from plasma using immobilized antiprothrombin antibodies was associated with the complete removal of the protein S inhibitory activity. We conclude that the anticoagulant activity of protein S is modulated by prothrombin and that this may represent another regulatory mechanism of the natural anticoagulant system...|$|E

In both groups, the first session of DP was given concurrently with local radiotherapy (30 Gy in ten fractions, 5 days a week). Another 16 patients (group C) under-went radiotherapy only. Results: Morbidity related to pamidronate was mild. Significant differences from the baseline (p < 0. 05, Wilcoxon test) were recorded for MVGLH, EGLH and RED values, regarding all groups. Improvement was significantly higher in patients of group B ver-sus A, while the results of pamidronate groups (A and B) were superior to group C, concerning the above indices (p < 0. 05, Mann-Whitney test). Additionally, pamidronate groups had significantly lower skeletal morbidity than group C. Conclusion: The 2 -h infusional flat dose of 180 mg every 4 weeks seems to be tolerable and superior to 90 mg regarding pallia-tion and mainly <b>recalcification</b> of osteolytic lesions. Radiotherapy alone is effective but inferior to the combined treatment. Last but not least, the findings of MVGLH, EGLH and RED indicate an important increase in bone mass and bone formation, which wa...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{hypertensive}} {{condition is}} known to be an important risk factor for arterial disease and thrombotic events. The detailed understanding of the pathophysiology in thrombotic events is crucial for the development of both preventive measures and the treatment during the early stage. Microparticles are submicron cell membrane vesicle shed from the cell surface in response to cell injury or apoptosis, and they are an essential element in the process leading to the pathogenesis of thrombosis and hemostasis dysfunction in patients. Activation of blood cells can result in the formation of microparticles, which carry a negatively charged, phosphatidylserine (PS), with a diameter of < 1. 0 micron. The biological and clinical functions of microparticles have been highlighted in coronary artery disease and heart failure. Objective: To elucidate the functional role of microparticles in essential hypertension. Methods: We quantitated the total number of circulating PS+ microparticles and studied the role of PS+ microparticles to see whether they can shorten the plasma <b>recalcification</b> time in patients with essential hypertension. Results: The PS+ microparticles were detectable at a low level in healthy blood and significantly increased in the patients with essential hypertension. With regard to PS+ microparticles affecting prothrombotic state in hypertension, we enriched microparticles and determined their procoagulant activity with a plasma <b>recalcification</b> time. The clotting time was significantly reduced after the addition of enriched microparticles to plasma poor microparticles (PPMP). A significant negative correlation was detected between numbers of enriched-PS+ microparticles and plasma-clotting time (r=- 0. 43, P= 0. 01). Conclusion: Taken together, high levels of PS+ microparticles are present in the circulating blood of essential hypertension and may contribute to the generation and perpetuation of a thrombotic state...|$|E
