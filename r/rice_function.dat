40|$|This article {{provides}} novel analytical {{results for the}} <b>Rice</b> <b>function,</b> the incomplete Toronto function and the incomplete Lipschitz-Hankel Integrals. Firstly, {{upper and lower bounds}} are derived for the <b>Rice</b> <b>function,</b> Ie(k,x). Secondly, explicit expressions are derived for the incomplete Toronto function, T_B(m,n,r), and the incomplete Lipschitz-Hankel Integrals of the modified Bessel function of the first kind, Ie_μ,n(a,z), for the case that n is an odd multiple of 0. 5 and m ≥ n. By exploiting these expressions, tight upper and lower bounds are subsequently proposed for both T_B(m,n,r) function and Ie_μ,n(a,z) integrals. Importantly, all new representations are expressed in closed-form whilst the proposed bounds are shown to be rather tight. Based on these features, it is evident that the offered results can be utilized effectively in analytical studies related to wireless communications. Indicative applications include, among others, the performance evaluation of digital communications over fading channels and the information-theoretic analysis of multiple-input multiple-output systems.

40|$|A triplet of adjacent, highly similar GT motifs in the phyA {{promoter}} of <b>rice</b> <b>functions</b> to support maximal expression of this gene. We have obtained a recombinant clone that encodes a full-length nuclear protein, designated GT- 2, which binds specifically to these target sequences. This novel protein contains acidic, basic and proline- + glutamine-rich regions, {{as well as}} two autonomous DNA-binding domains, one NH 2 -terminal and the other COOH-terminal, that discriminate with high resolution between the three GT motifs. A duplicated sequence of 75 amino acids, present once in each DNA-binding domain, appears likely to mediate DNA target element recognition. Each copy of this duplicated protein sequence is predicted to form three amphipathic alpha-helices separated from each other by two short loops. The absence of sequence similarity to other known proteins suggests that this predicted structural unit, which we term the trihelix motif, might be representative of a new class of DNA-binding proteins...|$|R

The OsHKT 2; 1 (previously named OsHKT 1) transporter from <b>rice</b> <b>functions</b> {{as a relatively}} Na+-selective transporter in heterologous expression systems, but the in vivo function of OsHKT 2; 1 remains unknown. Here, we analyzed transposon-insertion rice lines disrupted in OsHKT 2; 1. Interestingly, three independent oshkt 2; 1 -null alleles exhibited significantly reduced growth compared with wild-type plants under low Na+ and K+ starvation conditions. The mutant alleles accumulated less Na+, but not less K+, in roots and shoots. OsHKT 2; 1 was mainly expressed in the cortex and endodermis of roots. 22 Na+ tracer influx experiments revealed that Na+ influx into oshkt 2; 1 -null roots was dramatically reduced compared with wild-type plants. A rapid repression of OsHKT 2; 1 -mediated Na+ influx and mRNA reduction were found when wild-type plants were exposed to 30 mM NaCl.

In the majority of eukaryotic species, centromeres are associated with highly repetitive DNA, and as a consequence, the boundary for a functional centromere is difficult to define. In this study, we demonstrate that the centers of rice centromeres are occupied by a 155 -bp satellite repeat, CentO, and a centromere-specific retrotransposon, CRR. The CentO satellite is located within the chromosomal regions to which the spindle fibers attach. CentO is quantitatively variable among the 12 rice centromeres, ranging from 65 kb to 2 Mb, and is interrupted irregularly by CRR elements. The break points of 14 rice centromere misdivision events were mapped {{to the middle of the}} CentO arrays, suggesting that the CentO satellite is located within the functional domain of rice centromeres.

30|$|Basal {{segments}} of nodal roots from all four cultivars were thinner {{when exposed to}} drought, an effect that has been observed in other studies (Kadam et al. 2015; Kadam et al. 2017). The basal {{segments of}} large lateral roots were also thinner under drought, but these roots became thicker as they elongated into medium that had increasing moisture with depth (Additional file 7 : Figure S 6). Thinner roots may be beneficial for soil exploration because they have less nutrient and carbon cost per unit length, increasing resources available for root elongation into new soil domains (Lynch 2013), and they can explore small pores and crevices in the soil (Bengough et al. 2011). On the other hand, thicker roots {{have been associated with}} better soil penetration ability, which is important for root growth into hardened soils or through hardpans under drought conditions (Clark et al. 2008; Gowda et al. 2011; Lynch et al., 2014).

As putative pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), both Gh-LYK 1 and Gh-LYK 2 are membrane-localized, and all three LysM domains of Gh-LYK 1 and Gh-LYK 2 are required for their chitin-binding ability. However, since Gh-LYK 2, but not Gh-LYK 1, is a pseudo-kinase and, on the other hand, the ectodomain (ED) of Gh-LYK 2 can induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst in planta, Gh-LYK 2 and Gh-LYK 1 may contribute differently to cotton defense.

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to test to what extent {{international}} rice markets are related to each other by measuring price transmission using the monthly export rice prices of five major markets taken from FAO’s Global Information and Early Warning System database. The prices are specified into a vector auto regression (VAR) model and the results are interpreted using Granger and Toda-Yamamoto causality tests as well as generalized impulse response functions (IRF). The causality tests are used to verify whether price transmission exists between several major rice export markets from Asia and the Americas. Furthermore, generalized impulse response functions are simulated to provide information on the magnitude and persistence of the price transmission which takes place between international rice markets. Understanding the extent of price relations between international rice markets gives an indication of how well the world <b>rice</b> market <b>functions</b> and even whether it is appropriate to view international rice markets as a single market.
