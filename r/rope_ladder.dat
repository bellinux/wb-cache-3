5|$|Some {{relics of}} the Bastille survive: the Carnavalet Museum holds objects {{including}} one of the stone models of the Bastille made by Palloy and the <b>rope</b> <b>ladder</b> used by Latude {{to escape from the}} prison roof in the 18th century, while the mechanism and bells of the prison clock are exhibited in Musée Européen d'Art Campanaire at L'Isle-Jourdain. The key to the Bastille was given to George Washington in 1790 by Lafayette and is displayed in the historic house of Mount Vernon. The Bastille's archives are now held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{immediately}} began {{making plans to}} break Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon out of the prison. The first attempt involved explosives that had been smuggled into the prison, which were {{to be used to}} blow a hole in a door which would give the prisoners access to the exercise yard. From there, they would scale a <b>rope</b> <b>ladder</b> thrown over the exterior wall by members of the IRA's Dublin Brigade who would have a getaway car waiting to complete the escape. The plan failed when the prisoners could not gain access to the exercise yard and the <b>rope</b> <b>ladder</b> was spotted, so the IRA began making new escape plans. The idea of using a helicopter in an escape had been discussed before, an idea to break Gerry Adams out of Long Kesh internment camp had been ruled out because of faster and more sophisticated British Army helicopters being stationed at a nearby base. The IRA's GHQ staff approved the plan to break out Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon, and arrangements were made to obtain a helicopter. A man with an American accent calling himself Mr. Leonard approached the manager of Irish Helicopters at Dublin Airport, with a view to hiring a helicopter for an aerial photographic shoot in County Laois. After being shown the company's fleet of helicopters, Leonard arranged to hire a five-seater Alouette II for 31 October.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January {{a platoon}} of the 2/17th Infantry Battalion {{replaced}} a <b>rope</b> <b>ladder,</b> and after climbing it and two wooden ladders reached an area atop a cliff which {{had once been a}} Japanese headquarters. It would have been a formidable position if defended, but it was not. The main body of the battalion followed the next day. The Goaling River was crossed in small boats left behind by the Japanese on 13 January and it entered Nambariwa, where one prisoner was taken, six Japanese were shot, and nine found dead. On 15 January, Sio was taken. The Sio-Nambariwa area was found to have been the principal Japanese supply area, and a large number of fuel, supply, and stores dumps were found. During the advance from Fortification Point to Sio, 303 Japanese had been killed or found dead, and 22 captured. The 20th Infantry Brigade had lost 3 killed and 13 wounded, but 958 had been evacuated sick, mostly with malaria, and an epidemic of dengue had also taken its toll. Large quantities of Japanese equipment had been captured, including six 75 mm guns, three 37 mm guns and three 20 mm guns.|$|E

During this time all 29 crewmen were brought off successfully, though one suffered crushed legs when he hesitated to descend the <b>rope</b> <b>ladder</b> and was trapped between the lifeboat and the Mount Ida; he later died of his injuries in Cromer Hospital.|$|E
25|$|One soldier shot at Lin's {{limousine}} as it left Beidaihe, but missed, {{and most}} soldiers {{that the party}} encountered {{on their way to}} the airport allowed the limousine to pass. According to the driver of Lin's limousine, there was no time to place mobile stairs next to the plane's entrance, so the party boarded the plane via a <b>rope</b> <b>ladder.</b> Lin Biao was so weak that he had to be lifted and pulled onto the plane.|$|E
25|$|Boardwalk Games include {{physical}} challenges {{such as a}} rock wall, soccer, {{basketball and}} a <b>rope</b> <b>ladder</b> crawl. A variety of traditional pitch three balls and win a prize type games, such as squirt gun into clowns mouth, knock off milk bottles, pitch a quarter onto a plate are pitched by hawkers along the Boardwalk Games midway. In September 2012, Perilous Plunge closed for {{an expansion of the}} Boardwalk. Perilous Plunge was noticeably known as one of Knott's major thrill rides. The boardwalk reopened after a year transformation with two flat rides and a new family roller coaster taking the spot of Perilous Plunge. The Boomerang roller coaster also got repainted with a new vibrant green and yellow color scheme.|$|E

25|$|On February 1, 1564 {{he issued}} an edict setting a curfew for 10 p.m. {{in the city}} of Lima. On the {{following}} February 20, at midnight, four figures with their faces completely covered were seen violating the curfew. They entered the street of Trapitos and took up positions outside one of the houses there. At night this street {{was one of the most}} deserted in the city. The block in question was made up of four houses, none of which opened on Trapitos. There were no doors, but there were some balconies overlooking the street. Shortly after the arrival of the masked men, a <b>rope</b> <b>ladder</b> was thrown down from one of these balconies, and a man wrapped in a cape began to descend. Just before he reached the street, the four men lying in wait began to beat him with sandbags.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than simply}} sneaking Jim {{out of the}} shed where he is being held, Tom {{develops}} an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a <b>rope</b> <b>ladder</b> sent in Jim's food, and other elements from adventure books he has read, including an anonymous note to the Phelps warning them of the whole scheme. During the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone. Although a local doctor admires Jim's decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep {{and returned to the}} Phelps. After this, events quickly resolve themselves. Tom's Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck and Tom's true identities to the Phelps family. Jim is revealed to be a free man: Miss Watson died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, but Tom (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to Huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for Jim. Jim tells Huck that Huck's father (Pap Finn) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so Huck may now return safely to St. Petersburg. Huck is rewarded six hundred dollars for saving the aunts from the con men. Huck gives most of it to Jim for his family. Huck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story, and despite Sally's plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to Indian Territory.|$|E
500|$|To save {{himself from}} future crevasses, Mawson {{constructed}} a <b>rope</b> <b>ladder,</b> which he carried {{over his shoulder}} and was attached to the sledge. It paid off almost immediately, and twice in the following days it allowed him to climb from crevasses. Once out of the Mertz Glacier his mileage increased, and on 28 January Madigan Nunatak came into view. The following day, after travelling 5miles, a cairn covered with black cloth appeared about [...] to his right. In it he found food and a note from Archibald Lang McLean, who along with Frank Hurley and Alfred Hodgeman had been sent out by Auroras captain John King Davis to search for the Far Eastern Party.|$|E

500|$|The balcony {{scene was}} {{introduced}} by Da Porto in 1524. He had Romeo walk frequently by her house, [...] "sometimes climbing to her chamber window" [...] and wrote, [...] "It happened one night, as love ordained, when the moon shone unusually bright, that whilst Romeo was climbing the balcony, the young lady ... opened the window, and looking out saw him". After this they have a conversation in which they declare eternal love to each other. A few decades later, Bandello greatly expanded this scene, diverging from the familiar one: Julia has her nurse deliver a letter asking Romeo {{to come to her}} window with a <b>rope</b> <b>ladder,</b> and he climbs the balcony {{with the help of his}} servant, Julia and the nurse (the servants discreetly withdraw after this).|$|E
500|$|Linguet's {{work was}} {{followed}} by another prominent autobiography, Henri Latude's Le despotisme dévoilé. Latude was a soldier who was imprisoned in the Bastille following a sequence of complex misadventures, including the sending of a letter bomb to Madame de Pompadour, the King's mistress. Latude became famous for managing {{to escape from the}} Bastille by means of climbing up the chimney of his cell and then descending the walls with a home-made <b>rope</b> <b>ladder,</b> before being recaptured afterwards in Amsterdam by French agents. Latude was released in 1777, but was rearrested following his publication of a book entitled Memoirs of Vengeance. Pamphlets and magazines publicised Latude's case until he was finally released again in 1784. Latude became a popular figure with the [...] "Académie française", or French Academy, and his autobiography, although inaccurate in places, did much to reinforce the public perception of the Bastille as a despotic institution.|$|E
500|$|As a result, in {{the days}} after 14 July, the {{fortress}} was searched for evidence of torture: old pieces of armour and bits of a printing press were taken out and presented as evidence of elaborate torture equipment. Latude returned to the Bastille, where he was given the <b>rope</b> <b>ladder</b> and equipment with which he had escaped from the prison many years before. The former prison warders escorted visitors around the Bastille in the weeks after its capture, giving colourful accounts of the events in the castle. Stories and pictures about the rescue of the fictional Count de Lorges – supposedly a mistreated prisoner of the Bastille incarcerated by Louis XV – and the similarly imaginary discovery of the skeleton of the [...] "Man in the Iron Mask" [...] in the dungeons, were widely circulated as fact across Paris. In the coming months, over 150 broadside publications used the storming of the Bastille as a theme, while the events formed the basis for a number of theatrical plays.|$|E

50|$|Martel's forces used <b>rope</b> <b>ladders</b> and {{battering}} rams {{to attack}} the walls of Avignon, which was {{burned to the ground}} following its capture. The army then crossed the Rhône River into Septimania in order to lay siege to Narbonne.|$|R
50|$|Evacuation was {{hampered}} by the overcrowding of lifeboats {{and the loss of}} several boats to fire. Some passengers were able to reach the water via the gangways and <b>rope</b> <b>ladders.</b> Two ships alerted by distress signals managed to save most of the others.|$|R
500|$|Iguazu Falls was {{a natural}} {{location}} depicted in the film, although as stated by [...] "Q" [...] in the film, the falls were intended to be located somewhere in the upper basin of the Amazon River rather than where the falls are actually located {{in the south of}} Brazil. The second unit had originally planned on sending an actual boat over the falls. However, on attempting to release it, the boat became firmly embedded on rocks near the edge. Despite a dangerous attempt by helicopter and <b>rope</b> <b>ladder</b> to retrieve it, the plan had to be abandoned, forcing the second unit to use a miniature at Pinewood instead. The exterior of Drax's pyramid headquarters in the Amazon rain forest near the falls was actually filmed at the Tikal Mayan ruins in Guatemala. The interior of the pyramid, however, was designed by Ken Adam at a French studio, in which he purposefully used a shiny coating to make the walls look plastic and false. All of the space centre scenes were shot at the Vehicle Assembly Building of the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, although some of the earlier scenes of the Moonraker assembly plant had been filmed on location at the Rockwell International manufacturing plant in Palmdale, California.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 22, 1910. It states: [...] "May Brandon is a young woman of the present day who finds that the course of true love can sometimes run too smooth. She is engaged to the man of her choice, but no one objects. In fact, {{there is not the}} slightest opposition to her marriage in any quarter. And, being a woman, she does not like it. Perhaps she would have been married in the orthodox way {{had it not been for}} a dream that she had. In her sleep she found herself a beautiful young woman, persecuted because she was loyal to the knight she had selected. Her father was obdurate, and finally practically made her a prisoner in his gloomy old castle. Her sweetheart called with a <b>rope</b> <b>ladder.</b> They escaped, and after a number of thrilling adventures were married, and presumably lived happy forever afterwards. When May awoke, she was more discontented than ever. She flouted her fiancé, and returned his ring and swore she would never marry him. But finally she told him of her dream, and he won forgiveness by promising to run away with her like the knight of her dreams. Being a man of his word, he did. But the romance all faded out of it. The adventures they passed through were not to the woman's liking, and her experience convinced her that swashbuckling knights are as much out of date as are stagecoaches." ...|$|E

5000|$|Trapeze: Six figures climb three <b>rope</b> <b>ladders</b> up to {{an unusual}} flying trapeze apparatus. There is one regular trapeze, a two-layered trapeze, and a Russian trapeze.

2500|$|The gun deck {{was where}} the {{passengers}} resided during the voyage, in a space measuring about [...] with a [...] overhead (ceiling). [...] But {{it was also a}} dangerous place in conflict, as it had port and starboard gun ports from which cannon could be run out to fire on the enemy. The gun room was in the stern area of the gun deck, to which passengers had no access due to it being the storage space for powder and ammunition for the ship's cannons and any other weapons belonging to the ship. The gun room might also house a pair of stern chasers, small cannons used to fire out the stern of the ship. Forward on the gun deck in the bow area was a windlass, equipment similar in function to the capstan in steerage, which was used to raise and lower the ship's main anchor. [...] There were no stairs for the passengers on the gun deck to go up through the gratings to the main deck. [...] To get up to the main deck, passengers were required to climb a wooden or <b>rope</b> <b>ladder.</b>|$|E
