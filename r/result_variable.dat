5000|$|One of {{the more}} exotic {{features}} is the implicit [...] variable: every procedure in Nim with a non-void return type has an implicit <b>result</b> <b>variable</b> that represents the value that will be returned.

A {{subroutine}} automatically returns when execution reaches its last executable statement. Values may be returned by assigning to an identifier that has the same name as the subroutine, a function in Pascal terminology. This way the function identifier is used for recursive calls and as result holder; this is syntactically similar to an explicit output parameter. The same syntax is used in Fortran 66 and Fortran 77. In some other languages a user defined <b>result</b> <b>variable</b> is used instead of the function identifier.|$|E
