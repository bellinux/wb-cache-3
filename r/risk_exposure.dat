40|$|Firm-level <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> {{and costs}} of equity are {{notoriously}} difficult to estimate. Using a novel approach mapping consumption <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> to firm characteristics, we combine the traditional portfolio-level approach to testing asset pricing models with firm-level information to measure firm-level <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> First, at the portfolio level, we investigate the empirical performance of a simple two-factor consumption-based asset pricing model for the cross-section of equity returns. The priced factors in the model are innovations in the growth and volatility of aggregate consumption. Our empirical results show that this model can explain 66 % of the cross-sectional variation in returns on a menu of 55 portfolios spanning size, value, momentum, asset growth, stock issuance, and accruals. Second, we use the estimated model to map point-in-time firm characteristics to consumption <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> Through this measurement procedure, we uncover sizeable cross-sectional and time-series variation in firm consumption <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> We verify that sorting on these ex ante consumption <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> produces portfolios with consistent ex post <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> and predicts cross-sectional variation in future firm equity returns...|$|R

Our new method also reveals that hedge fund <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> vary within months, and capturing this variation significantly improves {{the fit of}} the model. The proposed method outperforms an optimal changepoint approach to capturing time-varying <b>risk</b> <b>exposures,</b> and we find evidence that there are gains from combining the two approaches.

30|$|<b>Risk</b> <b>exposures</b> {{are then}} {{measured}} by {{the gap between the}} upper price and the expectation and the expectation less the lower price. Parametric distortions are employed with parameters calibrated to enforce the absence of acceptable opportunities in the options market for the S&P 500 index. The convex and concave distorted physical distribution functions then sandwich the risk neutral distribution of the S&P 500 index. In the continuous time limit probability distortions may be replaced by measure distortions (Madan et al. 2016) of arrival rate functions to construct upper and lower prices and their associated <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> Such option calibrated <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> are then observed to be compensated by observed exponential variations across a wide variety of stock days.

25|$|Viticulture in Washington State {{is deeply}} {{influenced}} {{by the use of}} irrigation and the water rights associated with suitable vineyard land. Sourced from the major rivers that run through the area, most vineyards in Eastern Washington are irrigated though some vineyards (especially in the slightly wetter Walla Walla Valley near the Blue Mountains), but some have begun experimenting with dry farming. The ever-present threat of severe winter frost has influenced viticultural practices including the adoption of wind turbines to churn and circulate air in the vineyard. In the late 20th century, many producers began adapting Russian vine-training techniques for fan-training which promotes better air circulation among the vine so cold air doesn't settle on the vine. Due to the minimal <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> to phylloxera, some producers have opted to leave their vines ungrafted on its original rootstock since an exposed graft union is more vulnerable to frost damage. One benefit of the traditionally cold winters is that the grapevines are allowed to go into full dormancy, which allows the vines to shut down and conserve energy that will be vital {{at the beginning of the}} new growth cycle for the vine. The threat of freezing condition is the main viticultural hazard that vine growers need to concern themselves with since the lack of rainfall during the summer and autumn contribute to the dry, arid conditions that allows most of Washington vineyards to be relatively disease free.|$|E

Something of authority and privilege stuck to him from this, and it made Sherringham still more uncomfortable when he was most conscious that, at the best, even the trained diplomatic mind would never get a grasp of Miriam as a whole.
