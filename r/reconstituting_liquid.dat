40|$|Many {{proteins}} contain disordered {{regions of}} low-sequence complexity, which cause aging-associated diseases {{because they are}} prone to aggregate. Here, we study FUS, a prion-like protein containing intrinsically disordered domains associated with the neurodegenerative disease ALS. We show that, in cells, FUS forms liquid compartments at sites of DNA damage and in the cytoplasm upon stress. We confirm this by <b>reconstituting</b> <b>liquid</b> FUS compartments in vitro. Using an in vitro "aging'' experiment, we demonstrate that liquid droplets of FUS protein convert with time from a liquid to an aggregated state, and this conversion is accelerated by patient-derived mutations. We conclude that the physiological role of FUS requires forming dynamic liquid-like compartments. We propose that liquid-like compartments carry the trade-off between functionality and risk of aggregation and that aberrant phase transitions within liquid-like compartments {{lie at the heart}} of ALS and, presumably, other age-related diseases...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDry sesamol {{emulsions}} were synthesized {{from several}} combinations of saccharose withhydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) or sodium caseinate (SC) using spray-drying techniques at 120 °C to 180 °C, or freeze-drying. On {{the basis of}} physical characteristics such as droplet size distribution, residualmoisture, and microscopic structure, the best material was obtained when spray-drying was applied ateither 150 ° or 180 °C with SC or HPMC as excipients, respectively. The {{extent to which the}} antioxidantproperties of free sesamol towards a set of free radicals (galvinoxyl, diphenylpicrylhydrazyl, superoxide,and hydroxyl) were altered in the starting and <b>reconstituted</b> <b>liquid</b> emulsions submitted to normal storageor pre-exposed to a flux hydroxyl radicals was investigated. Emulsions were further evaluated for theirantioxidant properties in cultured 3 T 3 murine fibroblasts and in an ex vivo model of ultraviolet irradiatedrat skin. It was found that, in the material having the best physical properties, encapsulation was decisivein: (1) improving the overall antioxidant behavior of <b>reconstituted</b> versus starting <b>liquid</b> emulsions: (2) sparing sesamol consumption due to free radical attack; and (3) significantly protecting cells and skinagainst free radical- or irradiation-induced enzymatic release and/or lipid peroxidation. Demonstrating ahigh activity at high dilutions where interactions of excipient become negligible, the new emulsions couldbe of great interest in sesamol-based pharmacology or topical applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} and manufacturing protein biopharmaceuticals, aggregation is a parameter that needs careful monitoring {{to ensure the}} quality and consistency of the final biopharmaceutical drug product. The analytical method of choice used to perform this task is size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). However, it {{is becoming more and more}} apparent that considerable care is required in assessing the accuracy of SEC data. One old analytical tool that is now reappearing to help in this assessment is analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). Developments in AUC hardware and, more importantly, recent developments in AUC data analysis computer programs have converged to provide this old biophysical tool with the ability to extract very high resolution size information about the molecules in a given sample from a simple sedimentation velocity experiment. In addition, AUC allows sample testing to be conducted in the exact or nearly exact <b>liquid</b> formulation or <b>reconstituted</b> <b>liquid</b> formulation of the biopharmaceutical in the vial, with minimal surface area contact with extraneous materials. As a result, AUC analysis can provide detailed information on the aggregation of a biopharmaceutical, while avoiding many of the major problems that can plague SEC, thus allowing AUC to be used as an orthogonal method to verity SEC aggregation information and the associating properties of biopharmaceuticals...|$|R

40|$|Reconstituted infant {{formulae}} {{are excellent}} growth media for Cronobacter spp. (formerly Enterobacter sakazakii) and other microorganisms {{that may be}} present in such products. Immediate consumption or rapid cooling and storage at a low temperature are therefore recommended as control measures to prevent microbial growth. Placing a container filled with <b>reconstituted</b> <b>liquid</b> formula in the refrigerator, however, {{does not mean that}} the temperature of the liquid is directly the same as the set-point of the refrigerator. This study describes the temperature profiles and methods to predict lag time and possible growth of Cronobacter spp. during the cooling process in three types of containers. The overall heat transfer coefficients (a) were determined and were shown to have a very large variability in both household refrigerators and an air-ventilated refrigerator equipped with a fan. A mathematical model was built to predict the growth of Cronobacter spp. under dynamic temperature conditions using three models for the lag time. The various estimations for the lag time had a remarkably strong impact on the predicted growth. The assumption of a constant k-value (k = lag time × specific growth rate = ¿ × µ = 2. 88) fitted the experimental data best. Predictions taking into account the large variability in heat transfer showed that proliferation of Cronobacter spp. during cooling may be prevented by limiting the volume to be cooled to portion size only, or by reconstituting at temperatures of 25 °C or lower. The model may also be used to predict growth in other situations where dynamic temperature conditions exist...|$|R

40|$|Background: Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) {{mediated}} {{conversion of}} arginine (ARG) to citrulline (CIT) {{is a key}} pathway for nitric oxide synthesis. ARG is also metabolised by alternate pathways to ornithine (ORN), homoarginine (HMA), N G -monomethyl-L-arginine (MMA), N G,. N G -dimethyl-L-arginine (ADMA) and N G,. N G '-dimethyl-L-arginine (SDMA), {{all of which have}} the capacity to alter NOS activity. Simultaneous assessment of these analytes, when assessing the impact of arginine metabolism in human disease states, is desirable. Methods: Analytes (ARG, ADMA, SDMA, MMA, HMA, CIT and ORN) were isolated from human plasma by solvent extraction, evaporated and <b>reconstituted.</b> Ultra-performance <b>liquid</b> chromatography (UPLC) was performed on a 150 mm× 2. 1 mm T 3 HSS column using a gradient mobile phase comprising ammonium formate (10 mM, pH 3. 8) in methanol (1 % to 63 %). Analytes were detected by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-ToF-MS) in positive ion mode with electrospray ionisation (ESI+). Data were collected using MS E. Results: Solvent extraction provided high recovery (> 95 %). UPLC-QToF-MS E facilitated the separation and quantification of the 7 analytes in an analysis time of 6 min. The approach has high sensitivity; LOQ range from 0. 005 µM (NMMA) to 0. 25 µM (ARG and ORN), and good precision; intra- and inter-day %RSD are < 6 % for all analytes. Conclusions: This approach provides the capacity to quantify 7 key compounds involved in ARG metabolism in a small sample volume, with a short total analysis time. These characteristics make this approach ideal for undertaking a comprehensive characterisation of this pathway in large data sets (e. g. population studies) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{meningococcal}} serogroup A (MenA) polysaccharide conjugate vaccine used in Sub-Saharan Africa {{does not}} prevent disease caused by MenW or MenX strains, which also cause epidemics in the region. We investigated the vaccine-potential of native outer membrane vesicles with over-expressed factor H-binding protein (NOMV-fHbp), which targeted antigens in African meningococcal strains, and was combined with a MenA polysaccharide conjugate vaccine. The NOMV-fHbp vaccine was prepared from a mutant African MenW strain with PorA P 1. 5, 2, attenuated endotoxin (ΔLpxL 1), deleted capsular genes, and over-expressed fHbp in variant group 1. The NOMV-fHbp was adsorbed with Al(OH) 3 and used to reconstitute a lyophilized MenA conjugate vaccine, which normally is <b>reconstituted</b> with <b>liquid</b> MenC, Y and W conjugates in a meningococcal quadrivalent conjugate vaccine (MCV 4 -CRM, Novartis). Mice immunized with the NOMV-fHbp vaccine alone developed serum bactericidal (human complement) activity against 13 of 15 African MenA strains tested; 10 of 10 African MenX strains, 7 of 7 African MenW strains, and 6 of 6 genetically diverse MenB strains with fHbp variant group 1 (including 1 strain from The Gambia). The combination NOMV-fHbp/MenA conjugate vaccine elicited high serum bactericidal titers against the two MenA strains tested that were resistant to bactericidal antibodies elicited by the NOMV-fHbp alone; the combination elicited higher titers against the MenA and MenW strains than those elicited by a control MCV 4 -CRM vaccine (P 1 ∶ 000). The NOMV-fHbp/MenA conjugate vaccine provided similar or higher coverage against MenA and MenW strains than a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine, and extended protection against MenX strains responsible for epidemics in Africa, and MenB strains with fHbp in variant group 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the {{first use of}} a combination of the lyophilized components of the conjugated group C vaccine Menjugate™ <b>reconstituted</b> with the <b>liquid</b> group B outer membrane vesicle (OMV) vaccine MeNZB™. At 6 -week intervals, healthy residential students received three doses of MeNZB alone or concomitantly with one dose of Menjugate (MeNZB+MenC). Short-lasting injection-site reactions of mild or moderate intensity were frequent in both groups. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. After three doses, the percentage of subjects with serum bactericidal assay (SBA) titres ⩾ 1 : 8 against the serogroup B strain NZ 98 / 254 was 82 % for MeNZB+MenC and 78 % for MeNZB. All subjects in the MeNZB+MenC group achieved SBA titres ⩾ 1 : 8 against serogroup strain C 11 and 67 % in the MeNZB group. All SBA and ELISA responses of the combined vaccine were at least as good as for MeNZB alone. After vaccination, the pharyngeal carriage rate of any meningococcus in the vaccinated group had declined from 40 % to 21 %...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 40 individually-penned British Friesian male calves were offered milk {{substitutes}} ad libitum from 2 days until 12 weeks of age. Ten milks were reconstitued from either liquid or spray-dried skim milk and a fat-filled (500 g fat per kg) powder and contained 80, 110, 140, 170 or 200 g dry matter (DM) per kg liquid. A further six calves {{were used in}} a randomized-block experiment to measure the digestibility, absorption and retention of the diets containing 80, 140 and 200 g DM per kg. There are {{no significant differences in}} the intake, growth rate, digestibility, absorption or retention between calves given milk substitutes <b>reconstituted</b> from <b>liquid</b> or spray-dried skim milk. At all ages, as the DM concentration of the milks increased, liquid intake decreased but DM intake and live-weight gain increased. The mean live-weight gain was 0 · 99, 1 · 13, 1 · 16, 1 · 28 and 1 · 27 kg/day for calves given the milk substitute diet at concentrations of 80, 110, 140, 170 and 200 g DM per kg, respectively. The DM intake to live-weight ratios were constant at all ages when live weight was expressed to the power of 0 · 61. No significant adverse effect of the diets was evident from the fortnightly monitoring of jugular blood samples for packed cell volume and concentrations of glucose, urea-N, Na, total protein, albumin, globulin and haemoglobin; nor from faecal consistency, rectal temperature, heart rate and respiration rate. There was no indication that age affected digestibility, except that digestive efficiency was reduced in calves with diarrhoea, particularly at 2 to 4 weeks of age; nor that dietary concentration influenced digestion or absorption. The true absorption of N, Ca and P from the milk diets was high with mean coefficients of 0 · 99, 1 · 01 and 0 · 95 respectively. The main endogenous losses of N and P occurred through the urine and of Ca through the faeces...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Spray-dried {{monoclonal}} antibody (mAb) powders may offer applications more versatile than the freeze-dried cake, including preparing high-concentration formulations for subcutaneous administration. Published studies on this topic, however, are generally scarce. This study evaluates a pilot-scale spray dryer against a laboratory-scale dryer to spray-dry multiple mAbs {{in consideration of}} scale-up, impact on mAb stability, and feasibility of a high-concentration preparation. Under similar conditions, both dryers produced powders of similar properties—for example, water content, particle size and morphology, and mAb stability profile—despite a 4 -fold faster output by the pilot-scale unit. All formulations containing arginine salt {{or a combination of}} arginine salt and trehalose were able to be spray-dried with high powder collection efficiency (95 %), but yield was adversely affected in formulations with high trehalose content due to powder sticking to the drying chamber. Spray-drying production output was dictated {{by the size of the}} dryer operated at an optimal liquid feed rate. Spray-dried powders could be <b>reconstituted</b> to high-viscosity <b>liquids,</b> 300 cP, substantially beyond what an ultrafiltration process can achieve. The molar ratio of trehalose to mAb needed to be reduced to 50 : 1 in consideration of isotonicity of the formulation with mAb concentration at 250 mg/mL. Even with this low level of sugar protection, long-term stability of spray-dried formulations remained superior to their liquid counterparts based on size variant and potency data. This study offers a commercially viable spray-drying process for biological bulk storage and an option for high-concentration mAb manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|Reconstitution time {{of dried}} {{products}} {{is influenced by}} various factors including formulation, process, and reconstitution method itself. This manuscript describes factors affecting reconstitution in a dual chamber syringe using highly concentrated human monoclonal antibody and bovine serum albumin model formulations. Freezing and drying conditions had only minor impact on the reconstitution time, whereas the primary container and thus the geometry of the lyophilization cake played a major role. Prewarmed diluent and agitation decreased reconstitution time. For effective agitation, short displacements and high agitation frequencies {{were found to be}} desirable conditions to minimize reconstitution time for a given lyophilization cake while foam formation was minimized. The article also provides general strategies (e. g., reduction of lyophilized cake density, use of an optimized fill finish process, and suitable method parameters) to reduce reconstitution time, especially for drug product presented in a dual chamber syringe configuration. LAY ABSTRACT: Dried drug products need to be <b>reconstituted</b> to a <b>liquid</b> form before being applied parenteral. Reconstitution time is an important attribute and needs to be as fast as possible in order to serve patients' compliance. Reconstitution time is influenced by various factors including formulation, process, and the reconstitution method itself. The article provides general strategies (e. g., reduction of dried drug product cake density, use of an optimized fill finish process, and suitable method parameters) to reduce reconstitution time, especially for drug product presented in a dual chamber syringe. Fast reconstitution of lyophilisates in dual chamber syringe can be achieved by a combination of optimized manufacturing procedures and clear instructions for the end-user (e. g., roll syringe between palms to warm and agitate it to accelerate reconstitution) ...|$|R
