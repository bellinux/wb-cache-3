In some cases, these separations require total purification, as in the electrolysis refining of bauxite ore for aluminum metal, but a good example of an incomplete separation technique is oil refining. Crude oil occurs naturally as a mixture of various hydrocarbons and impurities. The refining process splits this mixture into other, more valuable mixtures such as natural gas, gasoline and chemical feedstocks, none of which are pure substances, but each of which must be separated from the raw crude. In both of these cases, a series of separations is necessary to obtain the desired end products. In the case of oil refining, crude is subjected to a long series of individual distillation steps, each of which produces a different product or intermediate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{experimental}} {{field for the}} cultivated production of Gentiana lutea L. was established five {{years ago at the}} Suvobor Mountain, Serbia. Soil analysis of this area re-vealed the occurrence of high pseudo-total (Ni – 1270 mg/kg, Cr – 423 mg/kg, Co – 385 mg/kg) and available (especially Ni – 133 mg/kg) heavy metals contents in the soil. Hence, the aim of this research was to evaluate the quality of Gentiana lutea L. – roots and galenic forms (liquid extract in 70 % ethanol, spissum and siccum) produced from the roots, because, for most plants, heavy metals accumulate in the root tissue. The amounts of Ni and Cr found in the analyzed roots were very high (54 mg/kg and 14 mg/kg, respectively). The efficiency of ethanol in extracting heavy metals from the roots varied depending on the particular element. The highest efficiency was obtained for Ni (41. 3 %), then for Cd (39. 5 %), Pb (37. 0 %) and Co (30. 4 %). According to this, a potential hazard exists for humans, if gentian's galenic forms are produced from the <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> with high heavy metals contents.

In order to be suitable for industrial use, respective agricultural <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>must</b> be competitive in price, as well as be available in respective quantity and quality. ATB has developed a new processing technology for the cleaning of shive-fibre mixes for better accommodation such requirements. Ultimate goal is the generation of dust and fibre free shives as well as the recovering of high quality short fibres from shive fractionation. This is facilitated by a new type of axial fractionators, which utilizes a multi-stage paddle screw and a screen drum, corresponding with the screw. This allows classification and cleaning of the shives as well as recovering of the short fibres in only one processing step.

30|$|Researchers often {{cite the}} metaphor {{in this example}} as a lens through which to {{investigate}} Mao’s thoughts about Chinese and Western cultures. Interestingly, advanced Western culture was analogous to <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> instead of edible food, suggesting that the culture abroad had to be transformed first, just as <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>must</b> be cooked to be real food. This metaphor constructed pragmatism such that Western culture was classified into two parts, and only the part coherent with Chinese socialism culture was chosen. For instance, Western culture, which is “progressive” and “useful,” is defined and includes the cultures of the various capitalist countries in the Age of Enlightenment. Moreover, in the metaphor, the digestive process is divided into several steps. First, the process of accepting and taking in Western culture is compared with the activity of chewing in the mouth and swallowing food into stomach. Then, during the digestive process, the saliva and gastric juices break down the food into either nutriments or waste. The waste is then excreted and discarded, and the nutriments are absorbed. In fact, {{this is not a}} natural process of our body’s functions since it overstates the control our body has by emphasizing the classification, selection, and treatment of food inside the body, when the only chance to make such choices is when food stays in our mouths.|$|R
