40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to: (1) determine the static stability characteristics of the Shuttle Vehicle 5 configuration; (2) determine {{the effect on the}} Vehicle 5 aerodynamic characteristics of External Tank (ET) and Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) nose shape, SRB nozzle shroud flare angle, orbiter to tank fairing, and sting location; (3) provide flow visualization using thin film oil paint; and (4) determine <b>rudder,</b> <b>body</b> flap, and inboard and outboard elevon hinge moments. The mated vehicle model was mounted in three different ways: (1) the orbiter mounted on the balance with the SRB's attached to the tank and the tank in turn attached to the orbiter; (2) the tank mounted on the balance (with the sting protruding through the tank base) with the SRB's and orbiter attached to the tank, and (3) with the tank mounted on the balance and the balance in turn supported by a forked sting entering the nozzle of each SRB, extending forward into the SRB's then crossing over to the tank to provide a balance socket. Data were obtained for Mach numbers from 0. 6 through 4. 96 at angles-of-attack and -sideslip from - 10 to 10 degrees...|$|E
40|$|Re-entry {{vehicles}} generally use {{control surfaces}} (e. g., <b>rudders,</b> <b>body</b> flaps, and elevons) to steer or guide {{them as they}} pass into and through the Earth s atmosphere. High temperature seals are required around control surfaces both along hinge lines and in areas where control surface edges seal against the vehicle body to limit hot gas ingestion and the transfer of heat to underlying low-temperature structures. Working with the NASA Johnson Space Center, the Seals Team at the NASA Glenn Research Center completed {{a series of tests}} on the baseline seal design for the rudder/fin control surface interfaces of the X- 38 vehicle. This seal application was chosen as a case study to evaluate a currently available control surface seal design for applications in future re-entry vehicles. The structures of the rudder/fin assembly and its associated seals are shown in the following illustration...|$|R
40|$|Re-entry {{vehicles}} generally require {{control surfaces}} (e. g., <b>rudders,</b> <b>body</b> flaps) to steer them during flight. Control surface seals are installed along hinge lines and where control surface edges move {{close to the}} vehicle body. These seals must operate at high temperatures and limit heat transfer to underlying structures {{to prevent them from}} overheating and causing possible loss of vehicle structural integrity. This paper presents results for thermal analyses and mechanical testing conducted on the baseline rudder/fin seal design for the X- 38 re-entry vehicle. Exposure of the seals in a compressed state at the predicted peak seal temperature of 1900 F resulted in loss of seal resiliency. The vertical Inconel rudder/fin rub surface was re-designed to account for this loss of resiliency. Room temperature compression tests revealed that seal unit loads and contact pressures were below limits set to protect Shuttle thermal tiles on the horizontal sealing surface. The seals survived an ambient temperature 1000 cycle scrub test over sanded Shuttle tiles and were able to disengage and re-engage the tile edges during testing. Arc jet tests confirmed the need for seals in the rudder/fin gap location because a single seal caused a large temperature drop (delta T = 1710 F) in the gap...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the booster {{verification}} wind tunnel test are presented. These tests were conducted in a 14 x 14 -inch trisonic wind tunnel utilizing a. 0035 scale model. The nominal Mach numbers tested were 0. 6, 0. 9, 0. 95, 1. 0, 1. 05, 1. 20, 1. 50, 2. 0, 2. 74, 3. 00, 4. 50 and 5. 0. The angle of attack range was + 5 to 40 deg. The yaw data was obtained over a range of - 10 to + 10 deg at fixed angles of attack of 0, 6, 15, 25, and 30 deg. The Reynolds number range was 4. 2 to 6. 9 million per foot. Results include elevon and canard effectiveness in pitch, and <b>rudder,</b> aileron, <b>body</b> flap, and tail effectiveness in yaw...|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} needs of current and future space vehicles, the NASA Glenn Research Center is {{developing}} advanced control surface seals. These seals are used to fill the gaps surrounding actuated structures, such as <b>rudders</b> and <b>body</b> flaps, to shield underlying lower temperature structures, such as mechanical actuators, from the hot gases encountered during atmospheric reentry. During previous testing, the current baseline seal design, which is used on the space shuttle as a thermal barrier and was selected as the rudder-fin seal on the X- 38 crew return vehicle, exhibited significant permanent set following compression at 1900 F (see the following photograph). Decreased resiliency (springback) could prevent the seal from contacting both of the opposing sealing surfaces and allow the ingestion of damaging hot gases during reentry, which could have detrimental effects on vehicle subsystems...|$|R
40|$|Force {{tests on}} a 0. 0035 -scale {{model of the}} General Dynamics/Convair {{aerospace}} space shuttle B- 15 B- 1 booster were conducted in the MSFC trisonic wind tunnel. The configuration has a low delta wing, all-movable delta-planform canard controls, and a single vertical tail. The test was devoted to investigating the effects of various configuration variables upon lateral-directional characteristics. These variables included wing dihedral, <b>rudder</b> flare, and <b>body</b> flap deflection. Yaw runs were made at angles of attack of 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, and 35 degrees. The Mach number range for this test was 1. 20 to 4. 96...|$|R
40|$|Major {{developments}} are examined which {{have taken place}} to date {{in the analysis of}} the power and energy demands on the APU/Hydraulic/Actuator Subsystem for space shuttle during the entry-to-touchdown (not including rollout) flight regime. These {{developments are}} given in the form of two subroutines which were written for use with the Space Shuttle Functional Simulator. The first subroutine calculates the power and energy demand on each of the three hydraulic systems due to control surface (inboard/outboard elevons, <b>rudder,</b> speedbrake, and <b>body</b> flap) activity. The second subroutine incorporates the R. I. priority rate limiting logic which limits control surface deflection rates {{as a function of the}} number of failed hydraulic. Typical results of this analysis are included, and listings of the subroutines are presented in appendicies...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{aerodynamic}} investigations {{were conducted}} in the NASA/Ames 3. 5 -Foot Hypersonic wind Tunnel during the interim April 9 - 18, 1973 on a 0. 015 -scale model of the Rockwell International Space Shuttle Orbiter, configuration 2 A. Six component aerodynamic force and moment data were recorded over an angle of attack range from - 3 deg to 42 deg at 0 deg angle of sideslip and from - 10 deg to 10 deg sideslip at 0 deg and 45 deg constant angle of attack. Test Mach numbers were 5. 27 and 7. 32 at unit Reynolds number of 2. 5 million per foot. Various elevon, <b>rudder,</b> speedbrake, and <b>body</b> flap deflections were tested to determine longitudinal and lateral-directional stability characteristics and to establish trim capability...|$|R
50|$|The forward rockets of the Reaction Control System, {{located near}} {{the nose of the}} Space Shuttle orbiter, {{included}} 14 primary and two vernier RCS rockets. The aft RCS engines were located in the two Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pods {{at the rear of the}} orbiter, and these included 12 primary (PRCS) and two vernier (VRCS) engines in each pod. The PRCS system provided the pointing control of the Orbiter, and the VRCS was used for fine maneuvering during the rendezvous, docking, and undocking maneuvers with the International Space Station, or formerly with the Russian Mir space station. The RCS also controlled the attitude of the orbiter during most of its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere - until the air became dense enough that the <b>rudder,</b> elevons and <b>body</b> flap became effective.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAerodynamic heating {{distributions}} {{were measured}} in vicinity of rudder shaft {{and inside the}} gap between the <b>rudder</b> and <b>body</b> of Ballistic Missile. Time-accurate predictions were performed using a hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navierâ€“Stokes/Baldwin- Lomax turbulence model. Gap size is varied and the extent of separation in front of the gap is a function of gap size. The structure of flow field and the heat flux distribution are given. The results indicate that when the height of shaft gap is lower than the thickness of the boundary layer nearby the shaft gap, the boundary layer is separated in front of the gap entrance, and then reattachment region is formed at the entrance of gap; the separation region is a region of high heat flux. The magnitude of peak heat flux nearby the gap is governed by the height of axle and Mach number. Region of peak heating is the stagnation of warhead when height of axle is higher than the thickness of the boundary layer. The region of peak temperature is at the warhead of bullet, the front edge of rudder experiences lower temperature, and the shaft gap experiences the lowest temperature of the three parts. The region of partial peak temperature near the gap changes from the lip of gap to the front edge of rudder shaft when the gap size is increased...|$|R
5000|$|Water striders vary {{in length}} ranging between 8 mm and 10 mm in size. Their body shape is very slender and {{elongated}}. They have six legs; the first pair {{is short and}} stubby while the other two pairs are thin and elongated which are used for moving over the water surface which we call [...] "walking on water". The first pair of legs is used for holding its prey, the middle pair propels the bug along {{the surface of the}} water with either a rowing or jumping motion, and the hind pair of legs is used as <b>rudders.</b> The entire <b>body</b> of G. lacustris including its legs is covered with many tiny hairs that have a wax-like coating. G. lacustris are dark brown in colour. Water striders have very strong sucking mouthparts known as a rostrum or beak.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a six degree of freedom (6 -DOF) {{nonlinear}} Monte Carlo dispersion analysis for the latest glide return to landing site (GRTLS) abort trajectory for the Space Transportation System 1 Flight are presented. For this GRTLS, the number two main engine fails at 262. 5 seconds ground elapsed time. Fifty randomly selected simulations, initialized at external tank separation, are analyzed. The initial covariance matrix is a 20 x 20 matrix and includes navigation errors and dispersions in position and velocity, time, accelerometer bias, and inertial platform misalinements. In all 50 samples, speedbrake, <b>rudder,</b> elevon, and <b>body</b> flap hinge moments are acceptable. Transitions to autoland begin before 9, 000 feet {{and there are no}} tailscrapes. Navigation derived dynamic pressure accuracies exceed the flight control system constraints above Mach 2. 5. Three out of 50 landings exceeded tire specification limit speed of 222 knots. Pilot manual landings are expected to reduce landing speed by landing farther downrange...|$|R
