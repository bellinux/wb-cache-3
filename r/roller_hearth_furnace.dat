40|$|Press {{hardening}} of MnB steels to high-strength {{body parts}} {{is a key}} technology in the automotive industry for improving passenger safety and reducing car weight. The dominant method in automotive production is direct press hardening, which comprises the austenitizing of pre-cut 22 MnB 5 sheets in a <b>roller</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> and immediate hot forming, with simultaneous hardening (martensite formation due to rapid cooling). A metallic AlSi coating protects the steel sheets from scaling. Since, however, it melts at 600 °C, the coating is transferred onto the mullite conveyor rollers through the constant mechanical contact. Beside the formation of process-disturbing residues baked onto the rollers, this melt infiltrates the microstructure of the furnace rollers. The mullite phase of the roller material is dissolved, and a zonal microstructure is formed, leading to uncontrolled roller fractures and hence to production downtimes. The approach chosen for preventing this corrosive process and increasing plant availability of the roller-hearth furnace is a sol-gel composite coating using a transitory aluminum oxide sol as the binder phase. The suitability of various ceramic filler powders is tested {{in a variety of}} laboratory-scale tests imitating industrial service conditions. Different coatings made with three selected powder qualities which were identified as being suitable are then tested under realistic conditions in a pilot-plant scale <b>roller</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace.</b> After three promising coating systems have been identi-fied, an actual production field test is carried out {{in order to determine the}} optimal coating system. In the first field test as well as in the subsequent test runs in different roller hearth furnaces, the application of this final coating causes a significant increase of roller life as well as a marked decrease in the spread of damage events. The coating minimises the number of baked-on residues and prevents, across a large number of conveyed sheets, the infiltration of the roller material...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the recent}} years, the {{automotive}} industry is focusing on {{the reduction of the}} vehicles weight, so as to minimize the CO 2 emissions, while improving the crashworthiness levels. In order to achieve a further body-in-white weight reduction and exploit the potential for lightweight construction of the hot-dip aluminized press hardening manganese-boron steel, further research on the design and development of a process chain for the production of thin hot stamped components is carried out. For this purpose the impact of different blank thickness-dependent process parameters on the component properties is determined through both simulation and experimental analysis. The temperature profile of the heating process is determined for different blank thicknesses and the development of the diffusion layer between the AlSi-coating and the base material is examined. With respect to the transfer process of the thin austenitized blanks from the <b>roller</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> into the forming tool, the time slot is determined via the analysis of the corresponding time-temperature curves. In addition, different simulation models are developed, aiming at the validation and optimization of the transfer process. In order to further investigate the manufacturability of thin press hardened components, the simulation of a hot stamping process is carried out. The developed models are verified by an optical 3 D forming analysis of the hot stamped components. As a conclusion of the current investigations, thin hot stamped components can be manufactured only under the precondition that the process is optimally designed and the process chain properly adjusted...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{furnaces}} with roller hearth have wide {{application in}} the steel industry. Typically, furnaces with roller hearth belong to the class of medium-temperature heat treatment furnaces, but {{can be used to}} heat the billets for rolling. In this case, the furnaces belong to the class of high temperature heating furnaces, and their efficiency depends significantly on the reliability of the <b>roller</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace.</b> In the high temperature heating furnaces are used three types of watercooled shaft rollers, namely rollers without insulation, rollers with insulating screens placed between the barrel and the shaft, and rollers with bulk insulation. The definition of the operating conditions of rollers with water-cooled shaft greatly facilitates the choice of their design parameters when designing. In this regard, at the design stage of the furnace with roller hearth, {{it is important to have}} information about the temperature distribution in the body of the rollers at various operating conditions. The article presents the research results of the temperature field of the hearth rollers of metallurgical heating furnaces. Modeling of stationary heat exchange between the oven atmosphere and a surface of rollers, and between the cooling water and shaft was executed by finite elements method. Temperature fields in the water-cooled shaft rollers of various designs are explored. The water-cooled shaft rollers without isolation, rollers with screen and rollers with bulk insulation, placed between the barrel and the water-cooled shaft were investigated. Determined the change of the thermo-physic parameters of the coolant, the temperature change of water when flowing in a pipe and shaft, as well as the desired pressure to supply water with a specified flow rate. Heat transfer coefficients between the cooling water and the shaft were determined directly during the solution based on the specified boundary conditions. Found that the greatest heat losses occur in the rollers without insulation. Insulation (screens or bulk insulation) between the shaft and the barrel of roller allows reducing the cooling water losses. A comparative analysis of research results allowed us to find that operating conditions of the furnace rolls with screen insulation are more favorable in terms of thermal conditions and losses, than those of rollers without the insulation and rollers with the bulk insulation...|$|E

40|$|In {{hot forming}} die quenching, {{furnaces}} {{are used to}} austenitize {{ultra high strength steel}} blanks. In the case of coated steels, like Usibor® 1500 P, furnace heating also transforms a protective Al-Si layer into a permanent Al-Si-Fe intermetallic coating. Modeling this process requires knowledge of the thermophysical properties of the material, specifically, radiative properties and how the sensible energy and latent heat of austenitization change with blank temperature. While the sensible energy is known, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the radiative properties and the latent heat of austenitization. In this work the effective specific heat of Usibor® 1500 P is inferred through inverse analysis of temperature data collected on coupons heated in a muffle furnace. This technique is first used to validate the heat transfer model, and then used to reveal the distribution of latent heat of austenitization at higher temperatures. The characterization of the radiative properties is carried out on Gleeble-heated coupons using a near-infrared spectrometer and a Fourier transform infrared reflectometer. Obtained thermophysical properties are employed in developing a heat transfer model for the patched blanks to gain insight into the non-uniform heating of patched blanks. The thermocouple measurements carried out in muffle and <b>roller</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> are used to validate the modeled temperatures. Various strategies to optimize the heating process for patched blanks are proposed and evaluated, including the use of a high emissivity coating to compensate for the increased thermal mass of the patch...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{a numerical}} {{approach to the}} search of a maximum heat transfer rate density (the overall heat transfer dissipated per unit of volume) from a two-dimensional laminar multiscale array of cylinders in cross-flow under an applied fixed pressure drop and subject to the constraint of fixed volume. It was furthermore assumed that the flow field was steady state and incompressible. The configuration had {{two degrees of freedom}} in the stationary state, that is, the spacing between the cylinders and the diameter of the smaller cylinders. The angular velocity of the cylinders was in the range 0 ≤ ϖ, ≤ 0. 1. Two cylinders of different diameters were used, in the first case, the cylinders were aligned along a plane which lay on their centrelines. In the second case, the cylinder leading edge was aligned along the plane that received the incoming fluid at the same time. The diameter of the smaller cylinder was fixed at the optimal diameter obtained when the cylinders were stationary. Tests were conducted for co-rotating and counterrotating cylinders. The results were also compared with results obtained in the open literature and the trend was found to be the same. Results showed that the heat transfer from a rotating array of cylinders was enhanced in certain cases and this was observed for both directions of rotation from an array which was aligned on the centreline. For rotating cylinders with the same leading edge, there is heat transfer suppression and hence the effect of rotation on the maximum heat transfer rate density is insignificant. This research is important in further understanding of heat transfer from rotating cylinders, which can be applied to applications ranging from contact cylinder dryers in the chemical processes industry and rotating cylinder electrodes to devices used for <b>roller</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces.</b> Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|Hot {{forming die}} {{quenching}} (HFDQ) is a heat treatment process used in automotive manufacturing to produce ultra-high strength steels. It involves heating steel sheets to a temperature above 1153 K and holding {{them for a}} period of time to ensure that the microstructure has fully transformed to austenite. Rapid quenching is subsequently performed to insure the austenite-martensite transformation of the steel crystallographic structure. The improved strength of these steels allows automotive manufacturers to use thinner sheets for structural members, resulting in reduced net vehicle weight and improved fuel efficiency without compromising safety performance. Austentization is mainly done using <b>roller</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces,</b> but the high energy requirements, slow heating time, and large production space has motivated investigation of direct contact heating as an alternative strategy. Previous work using a small scale prototype produced austenitized steel coupons in less than 25 seconds, and accomplished tailored microstructures within a coupon by use of different thermal effusivities in the die striking surface. Even though the striking surface is isothermal, the differing thermal properties of the steel and ceramic provide nonuniform heating over the blank and incomplete austenitization, leading to bainitic regions in the formed part. This method may be easier to control compared to other tailoring procedures, which focus on slower and nonuniform cooling during the quenching stage. This thesis builds upon the previous work and describes the design and fabrication of an electrically-fired, half scale industrial sized direct contact heating die with tailoring capabilities. The die was installed alongside a flat quenching die, with a transfer system between them, all encompassed within a 900 ton press. An FEM simulation was used to design the direct contact heating die. The model also included a constitutive metallurgical submodel, derived from Gleeble dilatometry measurements, that was used to predict heating and austenitization kinetics of the blank. Model predictions were confirmed using thermocouple measurements recorded during HFDQ, and metallurgical and microstructural analysis of formed blanks. The austenitization model allows for future optimization in the striking surface design as well as the performance of heat treated ultrahigh strength steels...|$|R
40|$|Hot {{forming die}} {{quenching}} (HFDQ) {{is a relatively}} new process in the field of automotive manufacturing. It involves slowly heating Usibor® 1500 P steel (a 22 MnB 5 steel substrate with a protective Al-Si coating) sheets to temperatures exceeding 880 °C, and holding it for a fixed amount of time to ensure the crystallographic structure has become fully austenitic. Once austenitized, the steel is then simultaneously formed and quenched into complex geometries in a single stroke. The quenching stage is critical, allowing for the formation of a hard and strong martensitic crystal structure that would not otherwise be formable at room temperature. These high-strength steel members allow automotive manufacturers to use thinner material cross sections in structural members, thereby reducing the net vehicle weight and improving fuel efficiency without compromising crash performance. Most HFDQ lines use <b>roller</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> to austenitize ultra high strength steel blanks. While this process is a capable, proven industrial technology, it is limited to relatively inefficient modes of heat transfer, and thus requires long heating times, large furnaces, and considerable energy to maintain temperature. It is the purpose of this work to describe an alternative heating technology in which Usibor® 1500 P coupons are austenitized by bringing them into contact with an electrically-heated monolith. In a laboratory-scale prototype, Usibor® coupons were austenitized in less than 25 seconds; subsequent material characterization and dilatometry investigations confirm that a fully martensitic structure is formed, and that the hardness and yield strength are comparable to furnace-treated samples. Tailoring material properties in HFDQ structural members (body-in-white components) introduces a combination of strong martensitic structures and other softer, more ductile daughter phases such as bainite, ferrite, and pearlite. Most tailoring efforts have focused on controlling the localized quenching rate during the forming stage through selective heating and cooling of the forming dies. This work presents an alternative, based on direct contact heating, in which tailoring is achieved through non-uniform austenitization during the heating stage of HFDQ. Experiments carried out on Usibor® 1500 P coupons show {{that it is possible to}} create a fully-hardened zone within the coupon that transitions from martensite to softer phases over a relatively short distance...|$|R
