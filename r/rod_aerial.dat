The wheels were occasionally fitted with disc-style covers. A later model IFF was fitted, replacing the aerials from the tailplane tip to fuselage with a <b>rod</b> <b>aerial</b> under the starboard wing. Another important feature of the Griffon-engine Spitfires was the entirely flush-riveted finish which was progressively introduced on all Spitfires.|$|E

Three 12 volt, 120 ampere batteries would be charged with either one of two generators, one bicycle-propelled and the other hand-cranked. The bicycle, which also drove a ventilation system, had its chain replaced with a leather strap, in order to minimise the noise when it was in use. In addition, an outside aerial was recommended. A <b>rod</b> <b>aerial</b> measuring [...] in length would be inserted through the east observation aperture.|$|E
50|$|Some early bat {{detectors}} used ex Navy, {{low frequency}} radio sets, simply replacing the aerial with a microphone and pre-amplifier. It {{is also possible}} to modify a portable Long Wave radio to be a bat detector by adjusting the tuning frequencies and replacing the ferrite <b>rod</b> <b>aerial</b> with a microphone and pre-amplifier.|$|E
50|$|Ferrite <b>rod</b> <b>aerials</b> (or antennae) are a type {{of small}} {{magnetic}} loop (SML) antenna very common in AM radio broadcast band transistor radios, although they began {{to be used in}} vacuum tube ("valve") radios in the 1950s. They are also useful in very low frequency (VLF) receivers, and can sometimes give good results over most of the shortwave frequencies assuming a suitable ferrite is used). They consist of a coil of wire wound around a ferrite rod core (usually several inches longer than the coil, but sometimes over 3 feet long). This core effectively ‘concentrates’ the magnetic field of the radio waves to give a stronger signal than could be obtained by an air core loop antenna of comparable size, although still not as strong as the signal that could be obtained with a good outdoor wire aerial.|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} article (reference 1), I made {{comparisons between the}} performance at 1. 8 MHz of the ferrite <b>rod</b> loop <b>aerial</b> and open frame loop aerials. Experiments were carried out using a ferrite rod 20 cm long by 9. 5 mm diameter and open loops 0. 8 m square. Generally speaking, the open loop aerials performed with signal sensitivity considerably better than the ferrite loop aerial. However, at frequencies below 100 kHz, I was able to achieve results which were essentially the reverse...|$|R
40|$|There {{the study}} objecst are the fibrous metal-composition materials, {{which have been}} {{reinforced}} by the continuous and discrete fibres. The paper purpose is to study the influence of pressure at the crystallization on the wettability of reinforcing fibres by the matrix melt for the making of industrial production process of shape castings in the metal-composition materials. The effective protective coat of carbon fibres against the burn-out {{of them at the}} heating in the oxidizing medium has been found. The improvement of fibre wettability by the metal melts under the influence of pressure at the crystallization has been showed by experiment for the first time. The influence of starting state of alloy on the wettability has been ascertained. The production process as the press-die casting with the crystallization has been developed for the Reflector parts of aerials of space communication in the metal-composition materials, for seven type sizes of pistons in the aluminium alloys and in the magnesium alloys, which have been reinforced by the fibres in the carbon, in the bazalt and in the mullite-silica. The pistons and the aerials of space communication passed the tests successfully, the experimental batches of articles have been produced. One from the pistons has been accepted for the quantity production. The application field is the production of metal-composition pistons, of connecting <b>rods,</b> of <b>aerial</b> reflectors and of other parts, which operate at the risen temperatures and at the risen loadsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
50|$|In modern radios, a ferrite {{loop antenna}} is used, {{consisting}} of fine wire wound on a ferrite rod. Litz wire {{is often used}} to reduce skin effect losses. The ferrite rod increases the magnetic permeability, allowing the physically small antenna to have a larger effective area. Other names for this type of antenna are loopstick antenna, ferrite rod antenna, ferrite <b>rod</b> <b>aerial,</b> Ferroceptor, or ferrod antenna.|$|E

5000|$|Other names include loopstick antenna, ferrod, and ferrite-rod antenna. [...] "Ferroceptor" [...] is {{an older}} {{alternative}} {{name for a}} ferrite <b>rod</b> <b>aerial,</b> particularly used by Philips where the ferrite core would be called a [...] "Ferroxcube" [...] rod (a brand name acquired by Yageo from Philips in the year 2000). The short terms ferrite rod or ‘loop-stick’ sometimes refers to the coil-plus-ferrite combination that {{takes the place of}} both an external antenna and the radio’s first tuned circuit, or just the ferrite core itself (the cylindrical rod or flat ferrite slab).|$|E
25|$|After {{feeling the}} draft of wind in the tunnel on that Levanter day in December 1997, the Gibraltar Caving Group had pushed aside some {{corrugated}} metal sheets, and found a bricked-in area of the wall. Carefully removing some bricks, they soon revealed a doorway behind the bricked-in area of the tunnel. In addition to the observations posts, including a concrete slab for that on the west, the men found {{the remains of a}} bicycle. They also located the tubing which sheathed the <b>aerial</b> <b>rod</b> along the stairs. Cork tiles on the floor provided insulation for purposes of both warmth and sound. They were in two patterns and shapes: square tiles arranged around the periphery of the room, presumably to indicate storage areas, and narrow tiles in a herringbone pattern in the main area of the room centrally. During the course of a 28-minute documentary that was filmed and produced in 1998, the team turned on the brass tap over the wash pit supplied by the 10,000 gallon water tank. The water, while initially black, soon ran clear. The men kept the location of the cave a secret for three months while they researched it. The documentary, Operation Tracer – Stay Behind Cave, was published in April 2012 (link to documentary below).|$|R
40|$|Actinomycetes were {{isolated}} from marine sediment samples {{collected from the}} east coast of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Well diffusion and agar plug methods were used for the evaluation of antibiotic production by these isolates against drug resistant Methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE). The potential isolate VITBRK 2 was mass cultured for morphological and physiological characterization. The culturing conditions of the isolate were optimized and the recommendations of International Streptomyces Project were followed for the assimilation of carbon and nitrogen sources. The isolate was identified by comparing the properties with representative species in the key of Nonomura and Bergey’s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology. Ethyl acetate extract prepared from the cell free culture broth of the isolate was analyzed using HPLC- diode array technique to characterize the metabolites and identify the antibiotics. VITBRK 2 was found to be Gram-positive <b>rod</b> grey color <b>aerial</b> mycelium production. It was also non motile in nature with spiral spore chain morphology. VITBRK 2 was identified as Streptomyces and designated as Streptomyces sp. VITBRK 2. HPLC-DAD analysis showed the presence of indolo compounds (3 - methyl-indole and 2 -methyl- indole) along with amicoumacin antibiotic. The observed activity of Streptomyces sp. VITBRK 2 against MRSA and VRE strains {{may be due to the}} presence of indolo compounds in the isolate. The results of this study suggested that secondary metabolites produced by Streptomyces sp. VITBRK 2 could be used as a lead to control drug resistant bacterial pathogens...|$|R
50|$|The {{first product}} {{launched}} was the RP10 Herald. In common {{with many of}} their 1960s designs, this was built into a wooden case covered in leathercloth, with foam padding under {{the front and rear}} panels and a turntable to enable the set to be rotated for best reception (the internal ferrite <b>rod</b> <b>aerial</b> being highly directional). It featured a large (5 inch by 8 inch) 30Ω loudspeaker, and was powered by two PP9 batteries. Initial sets used Ediswan transistors; later sets used Mullard devices, including the AF117, which unfortunately went on to suffer from tin whisker formation within the encapsulation.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} {{observation}} apertures, one west over the Bay of Gibraltar, {{and the other}} east over the Mediterranean. A small radio room contained the equipment for wireless communications, which included a Mark 3 transmitter and an HRO Receiver. Three 12 volt, 120 ampere batteries were charged with one of two generators, one bicycle-propelled and the other hand-cranked. A <b>rod</b> <b>aerial</b> measuring 18 feet (5.5 m) in length extended up the staircase in a tube from the radio room and was inserted through the east observation aperture prior to transmission and was withdrawn when transmission was completed.|$|E
50|$|Receiving antennas do {{not have}} to be as {{efficient}} as transmitting antennas since in this band the signal to noise ratio is determined by atmospheric noise. The noise floor in the receiver is far below the noise in the signal, so antennas small in comparison to the wavelength, which are inefficient and produce low signal strength, can be used. The most common receiving antenna is the ferrite loopstick antenna (also known as a ferrite <b>rod</b> <b>aerial),</b> made from a ferrite rod with a coil of fine wire wound around it. This antenna is small enough that it is usually enclosed inside the radio case. In addition to their use in AM radios, ferrite antennas are also used in portable radio direction finder (RDF) receivers. The ferrite rod antenna has a dipole reception pattern with sharp nulls along the axis of the rod, so that reception is at its best when the rod is at right angles to the transmitter, but fades to nothing when the rod points exactly at the transmitter. Other types of loop antennas and random wire antennas are also used.|$|E

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis consists essentially of two parts. The first is the design and development of/ ä rocket-borne V. L. P. receiver for the observation of the magnetic field component of electromagnetic waves in the frequency range 100 to 20, 000 Hz. The author's particular contribution was/ the optimisation of {{the design of a}} smallμ-metal <b>rod</b> <b>aerial.</b> The approach was necessarily partly empirical, partly theoretical. The former involved the systematic adjustment of the number of turns, coil geometry, dimensions and type of wire, etc. for the particular rod length small enough to be flown in the space available in the rocket nose-cone. This was complemented by a theoretical approach involving the rod and equivalent circuits which satisfactorily reproduced the measured frequency response and signal/noise properties of the aerial and preamplifier. The second part of the thesis is concerned with the analysis and interpretation of discrete V. L. F. emissions using the phenomenological theory of Helliwell. Both medium and high latitude emissions were analysed in detail. Significant advances were made in the computer iteration techniques applied to the analysis of these emissions and limitations in the analytical methods used were investigated in great detail. Particularly interesting were several "slow risers" recorded at Andoya (L = 6. 6) in northern Norway. The analysis determined the time varying energy spectrum of the phase-bunched electrons giving rise to the emission {{in the vicinity of the}} earth's equator (- 6. 6 earth radii) for a rangeof possible equatorial ambient electron densities. It was possible to determine an upper limit to the electron density at the equator which, since it was in excellent agreement with that (2 to 5 electrons/ cc) determined by more direct measurements, provided new experimental support for the theory. The limitations in the theory were examined and a small error in the original formula of Helliwell corrected...|$|E
