As it resulted, none of the prepared compounds surpassed obidoxime, which is considered to be the most potent compound if used for reactivation of AChE inhibited by paraoxon. In case of BuChE reactivation, two compounds (K 053 and K 068) achieved similar results as obidoxime...|$|R
40|$|A conceptually novel {{approach}} {{to the design of}} <b>reactivators</b> of nerve agent-inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is presented. The concept comprises the linkage of a peripheral site ligand via a spacer to a reactivating moiety with the eventual goal to develop non-ionic <b>reactivators</b> with sufficient affinity for AChE to induce reactivation and potentially improved blood-brain barrier penetration. Herein, the first step towards that goal-the synthesis and biological evaluation of a peripheral site ligand conjugated to a charged pyridinium oxime is discussed. It was found, that the introduction of the peripheral site ligand not only increased affinity of the construct for AChE but also enhanced reactivation of nerve agent-inhibited AChE. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
