Both red wines contained, apart from anthocyanins, also higher concentration of total phenolics, tartaric esters, and flavonols than the two white wines. All wines exhibited scavenging activity analogous to their total phenolic content. However, their phenolics differed in antiradical potency, which was visible in their EC 50 values. The dry red wine, Xinomavro, had a lower EC 50 value, indicating the higher antiradical potency of its phenolics. The scavenging capacities of phenolic extracts from Xinomavro red wine on hydroxyl <b>radicals,</b> <b>superoxide</b> <b>radicals,</b> and singlet oxygen were also assessed. Wine total extract was fractionated by extraction, and each of the three fractions was then subfractionated by column chromatography into two subfractions. Wine total extract, and its fractions and subfractions exhibited scavenging capacity on hydroxyl <b>radicals,</b> <b>superoxide</b> <b>radicals,</b> and singlet oxygen, indicating the activity of many wine phenolics. The most active wine extracts towards hydroxyl radicals were characterized by the high peaks of flavanols, anthocyanins and flavonols in their HPLC-DAD chromatograms. The most active extract towards <b>superoxide</b> <b>radicals</b> was rich in flavanols and anthocyanins.

5000|$|The assay of {{superoxide}} {{generated in}} biological systems {{is a difficult}} task because of its high reactivity and short half-life. One approach {{that has been used}} in quantitative assays converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, which is relatively stable. Hydrogen peroxide is then assayed by a fluorimetric method. As a free <b>radical,</b> <b>superoxide</b> has a strong EPR signal, and it is possible to detect superoxide directly using this method when its abundance is high enough. For practical purposes, this can be achieved only in vitro under non-physiological conditions, such as high pH (which slows the spontaneous dismutation) with the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Researchers have developed a series of tool compounds termed [...] "spin traps"(see spin trapping) that can react with superoxide, forming a meta-stable radical (half-life 1-15 minutes), which can be more readily detected by EPR. Superoxide spin trapping was initially carried out with DMPO, but, more recently, phosphorus derivatives with improved half-lives, such as DEPPMPO and DIPPMPO, have become more widely used.|$|E
50|$|The main {{cytotoxic}} effect of M. pneumoniae is local disruption of tissue and cell structure along the respiratory tract epithelium {{due to its}} close proximity to host cells. Attachment of the bacteria to host cells can result in loss of cilia, a reduction in metabolism, biosynthesis, and import of macromolecules, and, eventually, infected cells may be shed from the epithelial lining. M. pneumoniae produces a unique virulence factor known as Community Acquired Respiratory Distress Syndrome (CARDS) toxin. The CARDS toxin most likely aids in the colonization and pathogenic pathways of M. pneumoniae, leading to inflammation and airway dysfunction. In addition, the formation of hydrogen peroxide is a key virulence factor in M. pneumoniae infections. Attachment of M. pneumoniae to erythrocytes permits diffusion of hydrogen peroxide from the bacteria to the host cell without detoxification by catalase or peroxidase, which can injure the host cell by reducing glutathione, damaging lipid membranes and causing protein denaturation. Local damage {{may also be a}} result of lactoferrin acquisition and subsequent hydroxyl <b>radical,</b> <b>superoxide</b> anion and peroxide formation. The {{cytotoxic effect}}s of M. pneumoniae infections translate into common symptoms like coughing and lung irritation that may persist for months after infection has subsided.

40|$|ABSTRACT Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) consist of {{potentially}} toxic, partly reduced oxygen species and free radicals. After H 2 O 2 treatment, yeast cells significantly increase <b>superoxide</b> <b>radical</b> production. Respiratory chain complex III and possibly cytochrome b function are es-sential for this increase. Disruption of complex III renders cells sensitive to H 2 O 2 {{but not to}} the <b>superoxide</b> <b>radical</b> generator menadione. Of interest, the same H 2 O 2 -sensitive mutant strains have the lowest <b>superoxide</b> <b>radical</b> levels, and strains with the highest resistance to H 2 O 2 have the highest levels of <b>superoxide</b> <b>radicals.</b> Consistent with this correlation, overexpres-sion of superoxide dismutase increases sensitivity to H 2 O 2, and this phenotype is partially rescued by addition of small concentrations of menadione. Small increases in levels of mito-chondrially produced <b>superoxide</b> <b>radicals</b> have a protective effect during H 2 O 2 -induced stress, and in response to H 2 O 2, the wild-type strain increases <b>superoxide</b> <b>radical</b> production to acti-vate this defense mechanism.
