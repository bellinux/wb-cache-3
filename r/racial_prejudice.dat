5|$|Model's biographer, the {{military}} historian Steven Newton, {{argues that the}} best explanation for Model's behaviour {{is that he was}} not necessarily a Nazi, but an authoritarian militarist who saw in Hitler the strong leader that Germany needed. According to Newton, Model saw himself as the professional, apolitical soldier; he possessed a strong sense of German nationalism, with the accompanying tenets of <b>racial</b> <b>prejudice</b> against Slavs and Jews. This characterized many in the German officer corps, but in Model's case it was accompanied by a cynical willingness to placate the Nazi regime to expedite his own goals.|$|E

40|$|This paper o ers {{two related}} issues: (i) an {{application}} of beliefs about the cooperative behavior of others to policy-oriented issues; and (ii) a method of exploring <b>racial</b> <b>prejudices</b> where the subjects are oblivious of its purpose. We studied contributions and guesses about others' contributions in an experimental game. Prejudice is examined as a two-sided, implicitly held belief by Spanish college students toward any of the speci ed foreign population groups (i. e. Africans, Asians, Latin Americans and Westerners). The results show that subjects tend to harbor mixed feelings toward foreigners. However, <b>racial</b> <b>prejudices</b> do not have unique determinants across the foreign groups under study nor do the determining factors work in similar directions as observed with some signi cant variables such as individual net worth, beliefs about income status, religious intensity and societal cooperation...|$|R
