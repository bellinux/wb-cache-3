5|$|Miss Honora Sneyd {{would not}} admit the {{unqualified}} {{control of a}} husband over all her actions; she did not feel, that seclusion from society was indispensably necessary to preserve female virtue, or to secure domestic happiness. Upon terms of reasonable equality, she supposed, that mutual confidence might best subsist; she said, that, as Mr Day had decidedly declared his determination to live in perfect seclusion from what is usually called the world, it was fit she should decidedly declare, {{that she would not}} change her present mode of life, with which she had no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dissatisfied, for any dark and untried system, that could be proposed to her.|$|E
5|$|The US Chief of Army Staff, General Martin Dempsey, said Pakistan's {{anger was}} {{justified}} {{as it had}} a <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> furious given the loss of life. However, Dempsey did not apologise, saying {{he did not know}} enough about the incident and an inquiry was still being conducted. A senior advisor to Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that Pakistan and Afghanistan may be on a course toward military conflict. Hamid Karzai contacted the Pakistani Prime Minister to discuss the NATO strike and gave his condolences over the deaths of soldiers.|$|E
5|$|John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416) was Charles VI's {{uncle and}} a {{powerful}} figure in the kingdom, {{as well as the}} most famous and extravagant collector and commissioner of art of his day. He is still best known for commissioning the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, the famous International Gothic illuminated manuscript, and also commissioned the Holy Thorn Reliquary, now in the British Museum. The young king Charles had been forced to remove his uncle from governorships after the latter's rapacious conduct had led to unrest, and the meeting in 1391 marked their reconciliation after a period of bad relations. Lavish gifts among the Valois court circle were routine, and on this occasion Berry had special <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> generous.|$|E

5|$|The log-on message {{sent from}} the {{aircraft}} at 08:19:29 {{was not immediately}} well understood. The 02:25 handshake was also initiated by the aircraft. Only a few reasons that the SDU would transmit a log-on message exist, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to aircraft attitude. Investigators consider the most likely <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that they were sent during power-up after an electrical outage. At 08:19, the aircraft had been airborne for 7h 38min; the typical Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight is 5hours and fuel exhaustion was likely. In the event of fuel exhaustion and engine flame-out, the aircraft's ram air turbine would deploy, providing power to various instruments and flight controls, including the SDU. Approximately 90seconds after the 02:25 handshake, communications from the aircraft's inflight entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log. Similar messages would be expected following the 08:19 handshake but none were received, supporting the fuel starvation scenario.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel {{presented}} {{two main}} criticisms of Kantian ethics. He first argued that Kantian ethics provides no specific {{information about what}} people should do because Kant's moral law is solely a principle of non-contradiction. He argued that Kant's ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality. To illustrate this point, Hegel and his followers have presented {{a number of cases}} in which the Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer. Hegel used Kant's example of being trusted with another man's money to argue that Kant's Formula of Universal Law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good thing, because either answer can entail contradictions. He also used the example of helping the poor: if everyone helped the poor, there would be no poor left to help, so beneficence would be impossible if universalised, making it immoral according to Kant's model. Hegel's second criticism was that Kant's ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire. For Hegel, it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason. This means that, by not addressing the tension between self-interest and morality, Kant's ethics cannot give humans any <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moral.|$|E

25|$|The Sumerians saw {{sickness}} as {{a divine}} punishment imposed by different demons {{when an individual}} broke a rule. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a physician, one {{had to learn to}} identify approximately 6,000 possible demons that might cause health problems. To do this, the Sumerians employed divining techniques based on the flight of birds, position of the stars and the livers of certain animals. In this way, medicine was intimately linked to priests, relegating surgery to a second-class medical specialty.|$|E
25|$|Human reason {{requires}} more than being able to associate two ideas, even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect, perceptions of smoke, for example, and memories of fire. For <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved, the association of smoke and the fire {{would have to be}} thought through in a way which can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of Locke, for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of syllogism.|$|E

An unusual {{rise in the number of}} PCP cases in North America, noticed when physicians began requesting large quantities of the rarely used antibiotic pentamidine, was the first clue to the existence of AIDS in the early 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Jackson posted $3million bail, later {{requesting}} a reduced amount. The prosecution opposed this reduction, arguing that Jackson might relocate {{to another country}} as a fugitive and citing Andrew Luster as an example: Luster had fled to Mexico, notwithstanding his $1million bail bond. Many argued that Jackson had good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> angered at the excessive bail, as Phil Spector had to pay only $1million in his murder trial. To some, the high amount also indicated racism. After Jackson's acquittal, the judge ordered that the bail be returned to Michael.|$|E
25|$|John Willis-Bund {{states that}} the battle of Camp Hill was {{remarkable}} {{from the fact that}} an armed mob—they were nothing more—twice repulsed assaults of the best troops in the Royalist army, who attacked them in overwhelming numbers. That less than 300 men should keep some 1,800 at bay, even for a short time, was an act that deserved to be recorded; that they, an untrained mob, should have checked the dreaded Royalist cavalry, was a still greater achievement. The Parliamentarians were delighted, and they had <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> Captain Greaves, probably a local man, {{a member of the family}} that lived at King's Norton, who commanded the Parliament troops, might well be proud of his men's achievement.|$|E
25|$|Many {{sections}} of the country had <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dissatisfied with the existing autocracy. Nicholas II was a deeply conservative ruler and maintained a strict authoritarian system. Individuals and society in general were expected to show self-restraint, devotion to community, deference to the social hierarchy {{and a sense of}} duty to the country. Religious faith helped bind all of these tenets together as a source of comfort and reassurance in the face of difficult conditions and as a means of political authority exercised through the clergy. Perhaps more than any other modern monarch, Nicholas II attached his fate and the future of his dynasty to the notion of the ruler as a saintly and infallible father to his people.|$|E
