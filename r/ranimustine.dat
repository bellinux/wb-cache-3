40|$|The {{prognosis}} of CD 20 -positive (CD 20 +) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) {{with central}} nervous system (CNS) recurrence is still poor. A standard treatment for CD 20 + DLBCL with CNS recurrence in elderly patients has not been established mainly due to adverse effects. We previously reported the efficacy and safety of MIND-E (<b>ranimustine,</b> ifosfamide, procarbazine, dexamethasone, and etoposide) therapy for elderly CD 20 + DLBCL patients with CNS recur rence. Here, we report the use of R-MIND-E therapy (rituximab, <b>ranimustine,</b> ifosfamide, procarbazine, dexamethasone and etoposide) in an elderly CD 20 + DLBCL patient with CNS recurrence. The patient achieved a complete response according to Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, and treatment-related toxicity was tolerable. R-MIND-E therapy may be a feasible and useful treatment option for elderly CD 20 + DLBCL patients with CNS recur rence. </p...|$|E
40|$|Plasmablastic {{lymphoma}} is a {{rare and}} aggressive malignancy strongly associated with HIV infection. The refractory/relapsed disease rate is high, and the survival rate is characteristically poor. There are no satisfactory salvage regimens for relapsed cases. We successfully performed autologous stem cell transplantation using a regimen consisting of MCNU (<b>ranimustine),</b> etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan in a Japanese patient with relapsed AIDS-related plasmablastic lymphoma of the oral cavity. Highly active antiretroviral therapy continued during the therapy. Therapy-related toxicity was tolerable, {{and a total of}} 40 Gy of irradiation was administered after autologous stem cell transplantation. The patient has remained in complete remission for 16 months since transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Thrombosis in {{myeloproliferative}} thrombocytosis occurs {{usually in}} the microvessels and medium-sized arteries and veins and only rarely in the aorta. Aortic thrombosis is usually treated with thrombectomy. Reported here is a rare case that was treated pharmacologically. Case presentation A 60 -year-old Japanese woman presented with numbness of both lower extremities. Her platelet count was 1787 × 10 3 /μl. Through bone marrow examination, we diagnosed her condition as myelodysplastic and/or myeloproliferative disorder-unclassifiable. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomographic scan revealed aortic thrombosis. Her platelet count was controlled with hydroxyurea and <b>ranimustine.</b> Aspirin and ticlopidine improved the numbness in both lower limbs on the second day. Aortic thrombosis was not observed in a computed tomographic scan on the seventh day. Conclusion For aortic thrombosis, surgical management is usually adopted, but pharmacological management is also an option because of its immediate curative effects. </p...|$|E
40|$|VCAP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone) -AMP (doxorubicin, <b>ranimustine,</b> and prednisone) -VECP (vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisone) is a {{standard}} regimen for aggressive adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL). However, the efficacy of this regimen has not been fully elucidated for patients aged 70 years or older. Here, we retrospectively analyzed elderly patients with aggressive ATL at Nagasaki University Hospital between 1994 and 2010 to assess treatment outcomes. Of 148 evaluable patients, 54 were aged 70 years or older at diagnosis. The median survival time (MST) and overall survival (OS) at 2 years in elderly patients were 10. 6 months and 22. 1 %, respectively. Thirty-four patients received VCAP-AMP-VECP as the initial treatment, although the doses were reduced for most patients. In these patients, MST and OS at 2 years were 13. 4 months and 26. 6 %, respectively. Eleven of 34 patients (32 %) received maintenance oral chemotherapy {{after two or three}} cycles of VCAP-AMP-VECP, and MST and OS at 2 years were 16. 7 months and 32. 7 %, respectively. Our results suggest that the VCAP-AMP-VECP regimen may be effective and that maintenance oral chemotherapy may be considered as a therapeutic option for elderly patients with aggressive ATL. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 731 号 学位授与年月日:平成 26 年 12 月 3 日Author: Junya Makiyama, Yoshitaka Imaizumi, Hideki Tsushima, Hiroaki Taniguchi, Yuji Moriwaki, Yasushi Sawayama, Daisuke Imanishi, Jun Taguchi, Tomoko Hata, Kunihiro Tsukasaki, Yasushi MiyazakiCitation: International Journal of Hematology, 100 (5), pp. 464 - 472; 201...|$|E
40|$|In this {{prospective}} trial, a {{total of}} 74 children who were scheduled to undergo high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PB-SCT) were prospectively randomized at diagnosis to evalu-ate the effectiveness of exogenous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment in accelerating hematopoietic recovery after PBSCT. The diagnosis included acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n 5 27), neuroblastoma (n 5 29), and miscellaneous solid tumors (n 5 18). Eligibility criteria included (1) primary PBSCT, (2) chemotherapy-responsive disease, and (3) collected cell number G 1 3 105 colony-forming unit–granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) /kg and G 1 3 106 CD 341 cells/kg patient’s body weight. After applying the above criteria, 11 patients were excluded due to disease progression before PBSCT (n 5 6) or a low number of harvested cells (n 5 5), leaving 63 patients for analysis; 32 patients in the treatment group (300 mg/m 2 of G-CSF intrave-nously over 1 hour from day 1 of PBSCT) and 31 {{in the control group}} without treatment. Two distinct disease-oriented high-dose regimens without total body irradiation consisted of the MCVAC regimen using <b>ranimustine</b> (MCNU, 450 mg/m 2), cytosine arabinoside (16 g/m 2), etoposide (1. 6 g/m 2), and cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg) for patients with ALL, and the Hi-MEC regimen using melphalan (180 mg/m 2), etopo-side (1. 6 g/m 2), and carboplatinum (1. 6 g/m 2) for those with solid tumors. Five patients (two in the treatment group and three in the control group) were subsequently removed due to protocol violations. All patients survived PBSCT. The median numbers of transfused mononuclear cells (MNC), CD 341 cells, and CFU-GM were, respectively, 4. 5 (range, 1 t...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is a {{peripheral}} disease associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1. Treatment {{is carried out}} according to clinical type with watchful waiting being recommended for less aggressive types. Aggressive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is generally treated with chemotherapy and/or antivirals. The objective {{of this study was}} to correlate the survival of patients diagnosed in Bahia, Brazil, with the therapeutic approaches employed and to evaluate what issues existed in their treatment processes. Methods: Eighty-three adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma patients (26 smoldering, 23 chronic, 16 acute, 13 lymphoma and five primary cutaneous tumoral) with available data were included in this study. Results: Complete response was achieved in seven smoldering patients with symptomatic treatment, in two with chronic disease using antivirals/chemotherapy, in one with acute disease using antivirals and in one lymphoma using the LSG 15 regimen [vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisolone (VCAP); doxorubicin, <b>ranimustine,</b> and prednisolone (AMP); and vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisolone (VECP) ]. Smoldering patients who received symptomatic treatment presented longer survival. Favorable chronic patients treated with antivirals presented longer survival compared to the unfavorable subtype. However, for the acute form, first-line chemotherapy was better, albeit without significance, than antivirals. Only one of the patients with lymphoma and primary cutaneous tumors responded. Conclusions: Watchful waiting associated with phototherapy represents the best option for smoldering adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma with survival in Bahia being superior to that described in Japan. There was a trend of better results with zidovudine/interferon-alpha in favorable chronic disease. Excellent results were achieved in the lymphoma type treated with the LSG 15 protocol. Patients are diagnosed late probably due to lack of knowledge of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma by primary healthcare doctors and a Brazilian treatment protocol needs to be established...|$|E
40|$|Our {{previous}} phase II {{trial for}} treating human T-lymphotropic virus type I–associated adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) with vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VCAP), doxorubicin, <b>ranimustine,</b> and prednisone (AMP), and vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisone (VECP) showed promising results. To test {{the superiority of}} VCAP-AMP-VECP over biweekly cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), we conducted a randomized controlled trial exclusively for ATLL. Patients and Methods Previously untreated patients with aggressive ATLL were assigned to receive either six courses of VCAP-AMP-VECP every 4 weeks or eight courses of biweekly CHOP. Both treatments were supported with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and intrathecal prophylaxis. Results A total of 118 patients were enrolled. The complete response (CR) rate was higher in the VCAP-AMP-VECP arm than in biweekly CHOP arm (40 % v 25 %, respectively; P. 020). Progression-free survival rate at 1 year was 28 % in the VCAP-AMP-VECP arm compared with 16 % in the CHOP arm (P. 100, two-sided P. 200). Overall survival (OS) at 3 years was 24 % in the VCAP-AMP-VECP arm and 13 % in the CHOP arm (P. 085, two-sided P. 169). For VCAP-AMP-VECP versus biweekly CHOP, grade 4 neutropenia, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and grade 3 or 4 infection rates were 98 % v 83 %, 74 % v 17 %, and 32 % v 15 %, respectively. There were three toxic deaths in the VCAP-AMP-VECP arm. Conclusion The longer OS at 3 years and higher CR rate with VCAP-AMP-VECP compared with biweekly CHOP suggest that VCAP-AMP-VECP might be a more effective regimen {{at the expense of}} higher toxicities, providing the basis for future investigations in the treatment of ATLL.
