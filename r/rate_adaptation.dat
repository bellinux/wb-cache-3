There are some examples in which covariances strongly constrain the <b>rate</b> of <b>adaptation</b> but these are balanced by counter examples in which covariances facilitate the rate of adaptation; in many cases, covariances have little or no effect.

40|$|Visual {{uncertainty}} {{may affect}} saccade adaptation in two complementary ways. First, an ideal adaptor should {{take into account}} the reliability of visual information for determining the amount of correction, predicting that increasing visual uncertainty should decrease <b>adaptation</b> <b>rates.</b> We tested this by comparing observers' direction discrimination and <b>adaptation</b> <b>rates</b> in an intra-saccadic-step paradigm. Second, clearly visible target steps may generate a slower <b>adaptation</b> <b>rate</b> since the error can be attributed to an external cause, instead of an internal change in the visuo-motor mapping that needs to be compensated. We tested this prediction by measuring saccade adaptation to different step sizes. Most remarkably, we found little correlation between estimates of visual uncertainty and <b>adaptation</b> <b>rates</b> and no slower <b>adaptation</b> <b>rates</b> with more visible step sizes. Additionally, we show that for low contrast targets backward steps are perceived as stationary after the saccade, but that <b>adaptation</b> <b>rates</b> are independent of contrast. We suggest that the saccadic system uses different position signals for adapting dysmetric saccades and for generating a trans-saccadic stable visual percept, explaining that saccade adaptation is found to be independent of visual uncertainty.

Here, we address how the <b>rate</b> of <b>adaptation</b> of asexual populations is limited by its population size and mutation rate, as well as by two factors affecting the fraction of mutations that confer a benefit, i. e. the initial adaptedness of the population and the variability of the environment. These factors both influence which mutations are likely to occur, as well as the probability that they will ultimately contribute to adaptation. We attempt to separate the consequences of these basic population features in terms of their effect on the <b>rate</b> of <b>adaptation</b> by using results from evolution experiments with microorganism...|$|R

40|$|Gene {{regulatory}} networks exhibit complex, hierarchical {{features such}} as global regulation and network motifs. There is much debate about whether the evolutionary origins of such features are the results of adaptation, or the by-products of non-adaptive processes of DNA replication. The lack of availability of gene regulatory networks of ancestor species on evolutionary timescales makes this a particularly difficult problem to resolve. Digital organisms, however, {{can be used to}} provide a complete evolutionary record of lineages. We use a biologically realistic evolutionary model that includes gene expression, regulation, metabolism and biosynthesis, to investigate the evolution of complex function in gene regulatory networks. We discover that: (i) network architecture and complexity evolve in response to environmental complexity, (ii) global gene regulation is selected for in complex environments, (iii) complex, inter-connected, hierarchical structures evolve in stages, with energy regulation preceding stress responses, and stress responses preceding growth <b>rate</b> <b>adaptations</b> and (iv) robustness of evolved models to mutations depends on hierarchical level: energy regulation and stress responses tend not to be robust to mutations, whereas growth <b>rate</b> <b>adaptations</b> are more robust and non-lethal when mutated.

40|$|Explanations of the {{evolution}} of diploidy have focused on the advantages gained from masking deleterious alleles. Recent theory has shown, however, that masking does not always provide an advantage to diploidy and would never favor diploidy in predominantly asexual organisms. We explore a neglected alternative theory which posits that, by doubling the genome size, diploids double the rate at which favorable mutations arise. Consequently, the <b>rate</b> of <b>adaptation</b> in diploids is presumed to be faster than in haploids. The <b>rate</b> of <b>adaptation,</b> however, depends not only on the rate of appearance of new favorable mutations but also on the rate at which these mutations are incorporated (which depends on the population size and on the dominance of favorable mutations).

40|$|Abstract—Physical-layer network coding (PNC) is an {{effective}} strategy for increasing the throughput of wireless networks. In the current literatures, PNC without <b>rate</b> and power <b>adaptation</b> is mainly focused. Realizing that the transmission efficiency can be improved through <b>rate</b> and power <b>adaptation</b> in wireless networks, this paper focuses on developing a <b>rate</b> and power <b>adaptation</b> scheme for PNC. Through formulating how the data rate and transmission power affect the bit error rate (BER) of involved links in PNC, we observe that with a given data rate, the transmission power has to satisfy some constraints. Using these power constraints, we obtain a candidate set of optimal transmission power. By traversing the candidate set and the data rates supported by nodes, a <b>rate</b> and power <b>adaptation</b> scheme is developed. To test its performance, we apply the proposed scheme into an existing PNC-supported MAC protocol. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can improve the throughput and delay performance in various scenarios.
