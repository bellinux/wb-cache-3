50|$|Because <b>receiver</b> <b>sensitivity</b> {{indicates}} how faint {{an input}} signal {{can be to}} be successfully received by the receiver, the lower power level, the better. Lower power for a given S/N ratio means better sensitivity since the receiver's contribution is smaller. When the power is expressed in dBm the larger the absolute value of the negative number, the better the receive sensitivity. For example, a <b>receiver</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of −98 dBm {{is better than a}} receive sensitivity of −95 dBm by 3 dB, or a factor of two. In other words, at a specified data rate, a receiver with a −98 dBm sensitivity can hear signals that are half the power of those heard by a receiver with a −95 dBm <b>receiver</b> <b>sensitivity.</b>|$|E

This fact {{can cause}} the mentioned misalignment problem and {{the accuracy of the}} experiments can be compromised. Considering this, a balanced approach adopted in a WUSN testbed is to continue using the sensor nodes as part of the RF instrumentation, but selecting only a subset of the nodes. The selected nodes for an experiment are the ones previously qualified to perform the RSS measurements. Therefore, before using the sensor nodes for the WUSN experiments, they are tested in typical WSN scenarios, using over-the-air tests, in a process called qualification test. The reason for this test is explained by the following example.|$|R
