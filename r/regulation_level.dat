40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the paradox of}} prudential under-regulation in an economy that adopts financial reform, a reform which exposes the economy to future financial crises. There is individual-uncertainty about the crisis incidence, and the probability of the crisis is updated sequentially applying Bayesian inference. Costly regulation can mitigate the probability of the crisis. We identify conditions where the <b>regulation</b> <b>level</b> supported by the majority is positive after the reform, but below the socially optimal level. Tranquil time, when the crisis would not take place, reduces the regulation intensity. If the spell of no crisis is long enough, the <b>regulation</b> <b>level</b> may drop to zero, {{despite the fact that}} the socially optimal <b>regulation</b> <b>level</b> remains positive. The less informative is the prior regarding the probability of a crisis, the faster will be the drop in regulations induced by a no-crisis, good luck run. The challenges facing the regulator are aggravated by asymmetric information, as is the case when the public does not observe regulator’s effort. Higher regulator effort, while helping avoiding a crisis, may be confused as a signal that the environment is less risky, reducing the posterior probability of the crisis, eroding the support for costly future regulation. The other side of the regulation paradox is that crisi...|$|E

Results indicated that self regulation and peer influence are significant predictors of variance in alcohol consumption in individuals aged 18 - 21 years.

Currently, RNAi-based gene regulation using siRNA is predominantly used, but there are still many drawbacks that must be overcome as described above.

Therefore, a gene regulation strategy using nanomaterials may be an answer to the next generation of upgraded gene regulation systems that complement the advantages of existing methods.

We compare the res-ulting equilibrium <b>regulation</b> <b>levels,</b> outputs and welfare in a game with a multinational firm with those in an otherwise identical game with a national firm. For low transportation costs, output and pollution of a national firm is always as least as high as for a multinational; this changes for high transport-ation costs and intermediate damage parameters. When there is no lobbying, welfare levels are always higher with multinationals than with national firms. However, the existence of lobbying may reverse this ordering...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} cultural values, political institutions and government regulation of entry. For this, it couples data for 53 countries {{from a variety of}} sources in comparative political economy and cross-cultural psychology. A society's general attitude towards risk and uncertainty and power inequality are embedded in its institutions; hence, such values should mediate the intensity with which economic incentives affect regulatory procedures and outcomes. Results suggest that entry <b>regulation</b> <b>levels</b> are correlated with the way people in different countries deal with risk and uncertainty and accept inequality of power in their dealings with government institutions. Moreover, these intrinsic cultural values act as moderators for the correlation between economic and political variables, and regulatory intensity. Regulation thus emerges a response from government institutions to societies' needs deriving from cultural values. ...|$|R
