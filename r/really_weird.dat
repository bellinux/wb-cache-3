5|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States in general. In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed that when she was in school , she never saw anyone on television who looked like her, and she found it <b>really</b> <b>weird</b> because she thought there were so many people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that she did not want to be a stereotype of what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying that Indians never talk like Apu from The Simpsons. After signing the deal and being given all the 26 pilot scripts that ABC was developing for the 2015–2016 television season, Chopra chose Quantico. Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she found very new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E

"ME AND THE BEAST" [...] - They {{are from}} London but this left-field lyrical electro pop has a Björk like eccentricity, Kate Bush enigmatics in the vocals, {{and even a}} touch of the ABBAs in the music….piano, electro {{keyboards}} with bit of Fiery Furnaces quirkiness. <b>Really</b> original, <b>weird</b> and wonderful songs.

Most of it emerged from the Standing on the Shoulder of Giants sessions, where he decided to drop the equipment used in the three previous albums and instead buy [...] "loads of <b>really</b> <b>weird</b> pedals, old guitars, and small amps", as the lack of deadline to deliver the album allowed Gallagher to [...] "take quite a few days just messing around." ...|$|E

The following year, Butthole Surfers shocked many fans and critics by signing with the major label Capitol Records. In 2017, Paul Leary reflected: [...] "I {{grew up listening to}} The Beatles and Grand Funk Railroad and Dean Martin, and the thought of being on the same record label that they were on was too fucking weird, <b>really</b> <b>weird.</b> A lot of people gave us grief for doing that, but fuck: I wasn't going to turn that down." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a lit for The Quietus, Steve Mason, {{formerly}} of the Beta Band, has ranked it among his thirteen favourite albums, saying: [...] "Electro 2 really sticks with me for two reasons. Firstly it's {{got one of the}} most important records on it that I've ever heard in my life - 'Beat Bop' by Rammelzee and K-Rob. For me, when I hear that, it just encapsulates everything that hip-hop is about; that early 1980s Bronx/New York thing. I dunno why it does, but there's just something about it. The avant-garde-ness of it all. It's produced by Jean-Michel Basquiat. It's such an exciting record. It's <b>really</b> fucking <b>weird.</b> There's loads of reverb on the vocal and then that violin comes in. The rap is superb. It's stunning. Plus 'White Lines' is on it." ...|$|R

500|$|As the Scientific Phenomentalist, Lovering {{performs}} {{science and}} physics experiments {{in a lab}} coat while on stage.

He later explained: [...] "It's all kind of upbeat, <b>really</b> <b>weird</b> physics experiments that you'll never see. [...] I'd rather have them [...] going 'Is it [...] or isn't it?' rather than 'It's all science' or 'It's all magic'. So I do kinda weird things that other magicians don't do". Lovering cites sleight-of-hand artist Ricky Jay, mind reader Max Maven and Eugene Burger as influences on his technique. His performances often involve intricate self-built machines.|$|E

According to Spears, the series helped the couple {{to know each other}} more, saying: [...] "I didn't know [...] that well, and when I got the camera out, it made me feel better. It's <b>really</b> <b>weird</b> because it was like all this tension at first. We were so nervous being together.

The New York Times noted the way the film develops mood, finding it part of the cycle of Japanese films like Kiyoshi Kurosawas Cure and Hideo Nakatas Ring as [...] "vivid, state-of-the-art scare films that move so swiftly that psychological underpinnings are a luxury". The review concluded that in the film that [...] "things <b>really</b> get <b>weird,</b> though not particularly scary" [...] {{and concluded that the}} film as [...] "ultimately disappointing". Variety described the film as [...] "intriguing, if ultimately unsatisfying" [...] noting that despite the eccentric and supernatural phenomenon of the plot, the film did not sustain atmosphere or build a sense of dread between set pieces. The review concluded that horror fans would appreciate the films offbeat concept and visuals, while praising the films cinematography and soundtrack and finding the film hobbled by its [...] "typically bland, schoolgirlish heroine." ...|$|R

In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained {{the process of making}} the music video, and said, [...] "We shot the video at this really cool place in Crenshaw, in L.A., that was a bowling alley upstairs and a roller rink downstairs. It had this <b>really</b> <b>weird,</b> retro vibe to it. When they were setting up the different sets, we'd have to stop every 10 seconds because a bowling league would walk in.

500|$|Matt Groening first {{conceived}} Marge and {{the rest}} of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family. Marge was named after Groening's mother Margaret [...] "Marge" [...] Groening, who has said she bears little similarity to the character, stating, [...] "It's <b>really</b> <b>weird</b> to have people think you're a cartoon." [...] Marge's beehive hairstyle was inspired by the titular Bride in Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue.|$|E

It's only today that this could happen,'" [...] he explained.

Yelchin decided to carry on Walter Koenig's speech patterns of replacing [...] "v"s with [...] "w"s, although he and Abrams felt this was a trait more common of Polish accents than Russian ones. He described Chekov as an odd character, being a Russian who was brought on to the show [...] "in the middle of the Cold War." [...] He recalled a [...] "scene where they're talking to Apollo , 'I am Apollo.' And Chekov is like, 'And I am the czar of all the Russias.' [...] They gave him these lines.

Iglooghost said the name of the record came from looking at the sky while flying back home from his gig in Rome: [...] "The sky looked <b>really</b> <b>weird</b> and for some reason the word Chinese New Year came into my head. I was really happy, because everything seemed super cool, life just seemed really warm and nice. I think the word Chinese New Year sounds warm and cool. I imagine fireworks, red colours and Chinese lanterns.” Upon its distribution, Chinese Nü Yr garnered positive reviews. Gary Suarez, reviewing for The Quietus, spotlighted the EP's [...] "mirthfully manic synthesis of garage, hip hop, footwork, and as-yet undefined (sub)genres" [...] that [...] "makes him a beatmaker to watch." [...] Both Ryce and Exclaim! critic Ashley Hampson praised Malliagh for making such a unique record while still fitting with the works of other acts on the Brainfeeder label.|$|E

It had {{basically}} the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, <b>really</b> <b>weird,</b> we finished the song right then and there.

5000|$|Critics {{praised the}} scene where members of the study group {{looked at one another}} as {{possible}} sexual partners and strong utilization of the show's ensemble cast. Krakow called it [...] "best single scene of the season". Jason Hughes of AOL said [...] "This episode would have been great for {{the scene where}} the study group looked around the room thinking of one another sexually. Without a single word, there was so much spoken with facial expressions and eyes and turns of the head." [...] VanDerWerff remarked [...] "It's almost perfectly executed, each joke rolling {{off the top of the}} previous jokes, calling back on the show's short history and establishing that these people <b>really</b> are as <b>weird</b> of a little group as they seem to be." ...|$|R
500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that we would get together.

So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's <b>really</b> just <b>weird</b> luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me." [...] The song [...] "Momentary Thing" [...] by band Something Happens plays during Veronica and Logan's first kiss.|$|R

However, Bordin and Trujillo were {{occupied}} recording Ozzy Osbourne's latest album, forcing Comes With the Fall to both perform as Cantrell's band and open for him in October. The solo musician found himself ironically opening for bands that his previous elder group, Alice in Chains, had undeniably influenced. Regarding the tours, Cantrell expressed enthusiasm toward Nickelback, a Canadian band with high admiration for Cantrell. During some shows, Cantrell also joined Nickelback to play the Alice in Chains song [...] "It Ain't Like That" [...] together, as documented on Nickelback's Live at Home DVD. However, Cantrell also noted his annoyance toward Creed's indifference and lack of friendliness while touring with them, he said; [...] "Personally speaking, I {{had a great time}} with the Nickelback guys who are actually real guys and a young fuckin’ hot band, the whole vibe of being around that’s exciting. The Creed thing was a little more stale. I just didn’t find them very personable guys. I was on tour with them for fuckin’ ever and I still hadn’t even met em’. When you spend two months together, you generally find some time to fuckin’ say hello or whatever. It was <b>really</b> kinda <b>weird</b> in that respect.

[...] After being given all 26 pilot scripts which ABC was filming for the 2015–2016 television season, she chose Quantico. The actress, who had appeared in over fifty films at that time, was required to audition for the first time, which she found nerve-wracking. Safran was impressed by Chopra's audition, which helped him re-envision the character, adding [...] "She walked into the room, and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't know who she was, but we all sat up straighter. We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every {{hair on the back of}} your neck stands up watching her act. When I went back home I couldn't think about anyone else."

500|$|The episode {{features}} the last appearance of actor Harold Perrineau, whose character Michael dies in an explosion, {{as a main}} cast member. The character of Michael was absent for the entire third season of Lost and returned midway through the fourth season in [...] "Ji Yeon." [...] Perrineau was disappointed that he was {{brought back to the}} show only to be killed and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, [...] "there are all these questions about how [...] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a <b>really</b> big, <b>weird</b> stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting." [...] The fate of Jin, who is also on the freighter when it explodes, is left uncertain. Actor Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, which prompted speculation about his future on the series, due to co-stars Michelle Rodriguez (Ana-Lucia Cortez) and Cynthia Watros (Libby) leaving Lost after DUI arrests. This episode also marks Malcolm David Kelley's first appearance on the show since the third season, excepting a computer effects shot of the actor in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson". Kelley's character, Walt, was [...] "benched" [...] {{for the majority of the}} second and third seasons because the actor's growth was disproportionate to the amount of time that has passed on the island.

Following the demise of Levitation, Hayes began working with Heather Nova and All About Eve's Julianne Regan and O'Keefe collaborated with Dead Can Dance's Brendan Perry, whilst Francolini stopped playing due to disillusionment with the music industry (although he did help Scottish band Octopus get signed to Food Records and produced their debut album From A to B). They booked a studio and started rehearsing the day after they went to see Sonic Youth play at the The Forum in Kentish Town in April that year. After advertising for and auditioning several singers including Daisy Chainsaw and Queenadreena guitarist Crispin Gray, Hayes took over vocals. Francolini commented that the singers they auditioned [...] "seemed to suck the power out of it... it was <b>weird.</b> <b>Really</b> good people we worked with, you know?
