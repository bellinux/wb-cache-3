The plant is owned by ONE (48%), Endesa (32%) and Siemens (20%). In addition to the Tahaddart plant, ONE awarded Endesa the development rights of a two-unit, 800-MW gas-fired power station in the Sidi Kacem Province, with a completion date set for 2008 not completed in 2010.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{unsupervised}} classification of multi-spectral images, we propose {{to use a}} new vectorial fuzzy version of Hidden Markov Chains (HMC). The main characteristic of the proposed model is to allow the coexistence of crisp pixels (obtained with the uncertainty measure of the model) and fuzzy pixels (obtained with the fuzzy measure of the model) in the same image. Crisp and fuzzy multi-dimensional densities can then be estimated in the classification process, according to the assumption considered to model the statistical links between the layers of the multi-band image. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated with a Synthetic and real SPOTHRV images in the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rabat.</b> The comparisons of two methods: fuzzy HMC and HMC are also provided.

40|$|Quarrying is an {{activity}} {{contributing to the}} vitality of the Moroccan economy. However, most of these quarries were abandoned at the end of extraction and became dump and later a place of un-controlled landfills. The number of restored or rehabilitated quarries is limited and this threatens several aspects of the environment, especially, the quality of surface and ground water, landscape, forests, etc. This also gives rise to increased erosion risk. The study identifies plant species cover-ing 10 abandoned quarries in the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rabat,</b> especially the Bouregreg River and its affluent Akreuch in order to define a strategy for their restoration or rehabilitation. Field surveys were led to locate and map 10 abandoned quarries and to sample plant species. Herbaria were established and species were identified and classified. The results of the study distinguished 46 different plant species spread over 45 genera and 27 botanical families. The most dominant family in the quar-ries visited is Asteraceae. These results will allow us to study the vegetation dynamics in these abandoned lands and serve as a basis, in the selection of appropriate species in eventual restora...|$|E
40|$|Selected surface Terrae Rossae, or Rhodoxeralfs, and a Terra Fusca (Petrocalcic Palexeralf) {{developed}} on mid-Quaternary calcarenites in the moister <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rabat</b> show a substantial degree of pedogenic formation of clay minerals, particularly of kaolinites, {{primarily in the}} fraction 2 m, and smectites inherited from the calcarenite-residual loam in the coarse (2 - 0. 2 m) and fine clay fractions (< 0. 2 m). One Terra Rossa shows clear evidence that the soil formation was interrupted twice by deposition of eolian materials, hence it {{is regarded as a}} polycyclic pedocomplex. Eolian input was only of secondary importance during the pedogenesis of the other surface Terrae Rossae. On younger calcarenites (100 ka) near the coast, three Rendzinas, or Typic Calcixerolls, show only slight mineral weathering and pedogenic clay mineral formation, in spite of a varied spectrum of primary minerals. In one example kaolinite formation has just started. Probably the Calcixerolls were recalcified by addition of eolian material either as a result of anthropogenous thinning of the vegetation and/or due to the vicinity of the coast. These results strongly suggest that, at least in this region, Terrae Rossae, or Rhodoxeralfs, were formed during much of the Brunhes epoch in a younger coastal area and over the greatest part of the Brunhes epoch in areas farther from the coast. Because the climatic fluctuation in the cycles of cold and warm periods were generally slight in this region, the direction of soil formation was the same. Therefore we regard the Rhodoxeralfs in the northern p [...] ...|$|E
