40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of hydraulically actuated machine systems {{could be improved}} {{with the use of}} valves that have high bandwidth and high flowrates under low pressure drops. Although high flowrates can be achieved using very large spool strokes and/or diameters, the overall bandwidth of the valve will be reduced. Research has therefore been undertaken on a prototype valve design incorporating the Hörbiger plate principle, which utilizes multiple metering edges to allow high flowrates to be obtained at low pressure drops and small poppet displacements. The valve is directly activated using a piezoelectric actuator to achieve a fast dynamic <b>response.</b> <b>Valve</b> performance is assessed using a mathematical model that includes the piezoelectric actuator and power amplifier, the supply flow, fluid squeeze forces, end stop response, and valve mechanical components. The steady state relationship between valve flow, force and pressure drop, and the fluid inertance, were determined using computational fluid dynamics software. The simulation model has been validated using test data obtained from experimental tests undertaken on a prototype valve. Good agreement is obtained between the predicted and measured results and it is shown that the valve is capable of opening or closing fully in less than 1. 5 ms, and can pass a flow of 65 l/min at a pressure drop of 20 bar...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{self-regulating}} shielding gas valves {{have been developed}} to synchronise the shielding gas flow rate to the welding current being used in the gas metal arc welding process (GMAW). These valves make claims to reduce the shielding gas consumption by up to 60 %. One such system, the Regula® EWR Pro, has undergone detailed evaluation in an effort to fully understand the benefits that could be obtained. This electromagnetically controlled system necessitates around an extremely fast <b>response</b> <b>valve,</b> which opens and closes continually throughout the welding process. This creates a pulsing of the shielding gas, further reducing consumption whilst maintaining optimal shielding gas flow. The unit has been identified to reduce the initial gas surge at weld initiation and results in a virtually instant decay of gas flow at weld termination. These particular characteristics {{have been found to be}} ideally suited to saving shielding gas when carrying out intermittent or stitch welding. It was established that the use of this valve generated deeper penetration in fillet welds, which in turn has highlighted the potential to increase the welding speed, therefore further reducing gas consumption. In addition, a computational model has been developed to simulate the effects of cross drafts. The combination of reducing the gas surge and slow decay with faster welding has been shown to meet the drive for cost savings and improving the carbon footprint...|$|E
40|$|Valves {{are widely}} used for fluid flow control, not only for {{conventional}} fluid like water, gas and oil, but also for hydrogen under high pressure and so forth. Under these new conditions, the response time and energy consumption of valves {{are closely related to}} the whole performance of the piping system. Pilot-control globe valve (PCGV) is a novel quick <b>response</b> <b>valve,</b> which can utilize the pressure difference before and after the valve core to control the open/close states of the main valve. In this paper, the effects of spring stiffness inside PCGV on the flow and the valve core movement are carried out, respectively. To begin with, the experimental setup is introduces and the 3 D numerical model is established. The simulation is carried out in software FLUENT with RNG k-ε turbulence model, User Defined Function method and dynamic mesh regeneration methods under transmit state. Then, a comparison of steady valve core displacements between experiment and simulation is carried out. After that, the effects of spring stiffness on flow characteristics, valve core movement and response times during opening and closing periods are presented. Finally, a spring chosen correction equation is proposed. This work can benefit the further design work of PCGVs or similar valves with springs, and it can be also referred by someone dealing with novel control valves design or flow control issues...|$|E

40|$|Much resarch on {{the dynamic}} <b>response</b> of driven <b>valve</b> systems of {{internal}} combustion engines has been reported. However, the analytical model {{proposed in the}} previous reports constructed {{under the assumption that}} the valve did not separate from the rocker arm during the cam rotation. This model is applicable to the system with small rigidities. Recently, to have stable motion in high speed engines, the rigidity of the valve system increases, so that the previous model cannot be applied to the engines. This paper proposes a method for obtaining the jump and bounce phenomena of the valve system with large rigidities by considering the set force of the valve spring which gives large effects on the <b>valve</b> <b>response.</b> Numerical calculations have been carried out for one of the recest engines, and the experimental tests also have been performed to verify the present analysis...|$|R
40|$|Pressure-actuated {{reed valves}} play an {{important}} role in the compression process of a refrigerator compressor. The material properties and geometrical parameters of the valve and geometrical properties of valve port determine the flow coefficient which in turn impacts the compressor efficiency. Also, the moving mass of the valve and its stiffness governs the transient <b>response</b> (<b>valve</b> flutter) which impacts life and reliability of the valve in operation. Therefore, it is imperative to carefully design the reed valves to maximize compressor performance while meeting the above requirements. The design of reed valves involves determining the geometrical parameters (length, width and thickness) and material properties (type of steel etc.). These properties are chosen such that they correspond to the desired mass and stiffness of the valve. This work mainly focuses on determining the basic valve topology (geometrical parameters) with the desired mass and stiffness of the reed valve as design constraints. In order to obtain the optimum reed valve mass and stiffness values, an in-house system level performance simulation model is used. An analytical finite element based model has been built that searches for geometrical parameters which meets both target valve parameters and material limitations for reliability and life. This provides multiple valve designs with different geometrical parameters and gives the designer the flexibility to choose the most suitable valve design for a targeted application. Additionally, the basic valve topology will facilitate a more detailed performance analyses, viz. flow-thermal simulations and flow-structure interaction...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} experimental {{study on the}} patterning of thin films and spin valve devices. Initially {{the change in the}} magnetisation reversal of ferromagnetic Ni 80 Fe 15 Mo 5 thin films was investigated as the shape anisotropy was increased using optical lithography to pattern wire arrays. These structures show a progressive increase in coercivity and a transition between single and two-stage reversal with increasing milling depth. A similar patterning technique was applied to unpinned (Ni 80 Fe 20 /Cu/Ni 80 Fe 20) pseudo spin valve (PSV) structures in order to enhance the coercivity of one of the ferromagnetic layers. The increased coercivity induced by micropatterning changed the natural similarity of the magnetic layers and the structure exhibited a small spin <b>valve</b> <b>response.</b> These initial measurements were carried out with separate milling and electrical characterisation steps. However, it was decided that it would be ideal to design a technique to do in-situ magnetoresistance measurements during milling. This meant that the samples could be milled and characterised in the same step, leading to a much cleaner and more efficient process. In-situ magnetoresistance measurements were carried out during micropatterning of PSV devices, and the measurements showed the evolution in the electrical response as wire structures were gradually milled through the thickness. Contrary to what was expected, the structures showed a maximum spin <b>valve</b> <b>response</b> when fully milled through. The effect of further increasing the shape anisotropy by reducing the wire width, and changing the material properties in the PSV structure has also been investigated. MR measurements were taken as the temperature was increased from 291 K to 493 K, and the results show that the patterned PSV structures have a better thermal stability than exchange biased spin valves with an IrMn pinning layer. The experiment was extended to the nanoscale, and the results show that a significant increase in MR is not observed {{despite the fact that the}} magnetic configuration tends more towards single domain. This is thought to be due to an increase in the initial resistance of the structures. A small increase in MR was observed as the wire width was decreased from 730 to 470 nm, although the spin <b>valve</b> <b>response</b> is heavily dependent on the gallium dosage density during patterning in the Focused Ion Beam (FIB).
