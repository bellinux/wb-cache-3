40|$|Both the {{acridine}} half-mustard, ICR 191, and the nonalkylating azaacridine derivative, ICR 364 -OH, induce {{three classes}} of frameshift mutations in the histidine operon of Salmonella typhimurium. (i) One class is completely stable <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> tests and {{is presumed to}} represent deletion of {{one or a few}} critical nucleotide pairs or two nearby frameshifts. One extended deletion was found out of 11 stable mutations. (ii) Of two spontaneously reverting classes which also are considered to predominantly involve base deletions, one is unaffected <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> with ICR 191, nitrosoguanidine, and diethylsulfate, and the other is induced to revert with ICR 191. (iii) A third class, considered to predominantly involve base additions, responds <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> tests with ICR 191 as well as with nitrosoguanidine and diethylsulfate. Other investigators have shown that one mutant of this class is a “plus” frameshift and that nitrosoguanidine acts <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> to delete a guanine plus cytosine base pair. Although such plus frameshifts are found with high frequency among mutations selected from acridine-treated bacteria or when strong selection pressure is applied for their detection <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> tests, data from this laboratory indicate that this class of plus frameshifts is rare among mutations derived spontaneously or after treatment with a variety of other mutagens. Finally, we demonstrate that the alkylating ICR 191 and the nonalkylating ICR 364 -OH preferentially cause mutations in different chromosome regions and that their spectra of activity only partially overlap that found for spontaneous frameshift mutations...|$|R

Hope lives not by sight, as faith doth; but hope trusteth faith, as faith trusts the Word, and so bears up the soul in a patient expectation at last to enjoy what God has promised. But I say, the very natural work of this grace proveth, that the believer's best things are behind <b>in</b> <b>reversion.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the implications of}} mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> stock prices for longterm investors such as pension funds. We start with a general definition of a meanreverting price process and explain how mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> stock prices is related to mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> stock returns. Subsequently, we show that mean reversion makes stocks less risky for investors with long investment horizons. Next, we consider a mean-variance efficient investor and show how mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> stock prices affects such an investor’s optimal portfolio weights. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the investment decisions of long-term investors...|$|R
