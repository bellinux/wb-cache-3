5000|$|At one time, {{around the}} turn of the 20th century, there were 38 trains a day through Arlington, a lesser number through Lexington. On April 24, 1926, {{passenger}} service ended on the Reformatory Branch, and on February 5, 1927, the remaining freight service was abandoned on the short segment between Concord Center and <b>Reformatory</b> <b>Station.</b> On December 31, 1931, passenger service on the outer Lexington Branch from Bedford and North Billerica was discontinued. Remaining services were converted from steam to diesel trains in 1956. [...] In 1958, all four stations in Arlington were closed as part of massive B&M service cuts; ridership was low because bus service on Massachusetts Avenue was more frequent and often faster. By popular request, Arlington Centre was reopened in October 1965, and Lake Street in March 1968.|$|E
5000|$|In 1877, the Billerica and Bedford Railroad, a [...] narrow-gauge line, opened from Bedford Depot to North Billerica. The line built a two-stall {{engine house}} and a {{turntable}} at the Bedford terminus. The Billerica and Bedford was markedly unsuccessful, and closed down in 1878. In 1879, the Middlesex Central was extended to <b>Reformatory</b> <b>station</b> in Concord; this permitted short-lived through service to Nashua via {{a connection to the}} Nashua, Acton, and Boston Railroad. In 1885, the Boston & Lowell rebuilt the route to Billerica as part of their standard gauge network. The depot, originally west of South Road, was moved to its present location at the junction. The narrow gauge engine house was also moved and turned into a freight depot. Two years later, the Boston and Maine Railroad absorbed the Boston & Lowell, including the two routes through Bedford.|$|E
5000|$|The Boston and Lowell Railroad {{purchased}} {{the line in}} 1870 and built a new connection (most of which would constitute {{a major portion of}} the later Fitchburg Cutoff) to their main line at Somerville Junction. The connection, from what is now the Magnolia Field-Varnum Street area in Arlington, ran through North Cambridge and West Somerville (Davis Square); a station was located at Somerville Junction, commemorated by a park near what are now Centre and Woodbine Streets. The Boston and Lowell created a subsidiary, the Middlesex Central Railroad, to build an extension from Lexington to Bedford and then Concord Center (Lowell Road), which opened in 1873. The Lowell Road station was adjacent to today's Minuteman National Historical Park. A 2.5 mi extension from Concord Center to Concord Prison (<b>Reformatory</b> <b>Station</b> on Elm Street) would give the name Reformatory Branch to the Bedford-Concord segment in 1879. [...] The branch continued another half mile further west to a junction (called [...] "Concord Junction" [...] or [...] "Middlesex Junction" [...] per different sources) with the Nashua, Acton & Boston Railroad and other rail lines.|$|E

Also exempt were properties used {{for the care of}} people, such as quarantine stations, narcotics farms, immigration <b>stations,</b> <b>reformatories,</b> hospitals, and cemeteries.|$|R
