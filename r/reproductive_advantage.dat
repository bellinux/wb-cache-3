Natural selection can be contrasted with artificial selection, in which humans intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in natural selection there is no intentional choice.|$|E

25|$|From an {{evolutionary}} perspective homoeroticism {{is seen as}} counter-productive as it doesn’t directly contribute to successfully producing offspring. However, male-male sexual behaviour has been argued to have served an adaptive function and an indirect <b>reproductive</b> <b>advantage</b> for males. Evidence suggests that male-male sexual relations in early human periods often occurred between younger adolescent boys and older males. Sexual acts have been viewed as a psychological factor in societies used for bonding. These same-sex relations between young adolescent boys and older men brought many benefits to the younger males, such as access to food, protection from aggression and overall helping them attain personal survival and an increased social standing. These direct effects on survival also led to indirect effects of reproductive success. The advantages the young males would obtain from their sexual relations with older men made them a more desired mating choice amongst females. The age and status difference between the men involved, suggests that a dominance-submission dynamic was {{an important factor in}} these relations.|$|E
25|$|Oftentimes in {{the natural}} history of a species, large body size confers <b>reproductive</b> <b>advantage.</b> This raises the {{question}} in Hemipepsis ustulata: why do smaller wasps persist? Generation after generation, there is a wide size variation among these tarantula hawks. Wasps do not grow after metamorphosis, so smaller animals are at a permanent disadvantage competing against their larger fellows. John Alcock’s studies emphasize the importance of size variation in claiming desirable territories among male Hemipepsis ustulata wasps. It is hypothesized that female provisioning behavior {{may play a role in}} the maintenance of size variation in this species. In tarantula hawks, the size of the offspring is determined by the mother’s decision on how much to invest in each offspring. The size of the tarantula captured by the mother wasp is a function of how big the larva will become when fully grown. The subduing of a larger tarantula requires a greater energy investment and poses a greater risk to the mother wasp. If the offspring is a large male, it would have to be twice as fit as a smaller male offspring in order to repay the investment of the mother wasp. Thus, in some cases, it may be advantageous for the mother wasp to produce many small male offspring. This would enable them to enjoy the same level of fitness as a female, but with fewer, larger progeny.|$|E
500|$|Natural {{variation}} occurs {{among the}} individuals of any population of organisms. Some differences may improve an individual's chances of surviving and reproducing such that its lifetime reproductive rate is increased, {{which means that}} it leaves more offspring. If the traits that give these individuals a <b>reproductive</b> <b>advantage</b> are also heritable, that is, passed from parent to offspring, {{then there will be}} differential reproduction, that is, a slightly higher proportion of fast rabbits or efficient algae in the next generation. Even if the <b>reproductive</b> <b>advantage</b> is very slight, over many generations any advantageous heritable trait becomes dominant in the population. In this way the natural environment of an organism [...] "selects for" [...] traits that confer a <b>reproductive</b> <b>advantage,</b> causing evolutionary change, as Darwin described. This gives the appearance of purpose, but in natural selection there is no intentional choice. Artificial selection is purposive where natural selection is not, though biologists often use teleological language to describe it.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} sex {{includes}} two fundamental phenomena: the sexual process (fusion of genetic information of two individuals) and sexual differentiation (separation {{of this information}} into two parts). Depending on {{the presence or absence}} of these phenomena, the existing ways of reproduction can be divided into asexual, hermaphrodite and dioecious forms. The sexual process and sexual differentiation are different phenomena, and, in essence, are diametrically opposed. The first creates (increases) diversity of genotypes, and the second decreases it in half. <b>Reproductive</b> <b>advantages</b> of the asexual forms are in quantity of the progeny and the advantages of the hermaphrodite forms - in maximum diversity. Transition from the hermaphrodite to dioecious state leads to a loss of at least half of the diversity.

40|$|Within {{the large}} order of bats, sexual size {{dimorphism}} measured by forearm length and body mass is often female-biased. Several studies have explained this through {{the effects on}} load carrying during pregnancy, intrasexual competition, {{as well as the}} fecundity and thermoregulation advantages of increased female body size. We hypothesized that wing shape should differ along with size and be under variable selection pressure in a species where there are large differences in flight behaviour. We tested whether load carrying, sex differential migration, or <b>reproductive</b> <b>advantages</b> of large females affect size and wing shape dimorphism in the common noctule (Nyctalus noctula), in which females are typically larger than males and only females migrate long distances each year. We tested for univariate and multivariate size and shape dimorphism using data sets derived from wing photos and biometric data collected during pre-migratory spring captures in Switzerland. Females had forearms that are on average 1 % longer than males and are 1 % heavier than males after emerging from hibernation, but we found no sex differences in other size, shape, or other functional characters in any wing parameters during this pre-migratory period. Female-biased size dimorphism without wing shape differences indicates that <b>reproductive</b> <b>advantages</b> of big mothers are most likely responsible for sexual dimorphism in this species, not load compensation or shape differences favouring aerodynamic efficiency during pregnancy or migration. Despite large behavioural and ecological sex differences, morphology associated with a specialized feeding niche may limit potential dimorphism in narrow-winged bats such as common noctules and the dramatic differences in migratory behaviour may then be accomplished through plasticity in wing kinematics...|$|R

The results indicated that teleiophiles had more children, and thus more adaptive success than hebephiles, while hebephiles had more success than pedophiles. From this, Blanchard concluded that [...] "there is no empirical basis for the hypothesis that hebephilia was associated with increased reproductive success in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.

2500|$|Other theorists use {{cultural}} factors influencing reproductive success to explain monogamy.

This assertion leads to the prediction that the human hand should be adapted for throwing and clubbing, a topic that is explored in the following report. It is shown that the two fundamental human handgrips, first identified by J. R.

2500|$|After {{an initial}} focus upon E1b1b as a Neolithic marker, {{a more recent}} study in January 2010, looked at Y haplogroup R1b1b, {{which is much more}} common in Western Europe.

We looked at how the lineage is distributed, how diverse it is in different parts of Europe, and how old it is." [...] The results suggested that the lineage R1b1b2 (R-M269), like E1b1b or J lineages, spread together with farming from the Near East. Dr Patricia Balaresque added: [...] "In total, this means that more than 80% of European Y chromosomes descend from incoming farmers.

2500|$|More {{difficult}} for Darwin were highly evolved and complicated features that conveyed apparently no adaptive {{advantage to the}} organism.

[...] Why should a bird like the peacock develop such an elaborate tail, which seemed at best to be a hindrance in its [...] "struggle for existence"? To answer the question, Darwin had introduced in the Origin the theory of sexual selection, which outlined how different characteristics could be selected for if they conveyed a <b>reproductive</b> <b>advantage</b> to the individual. In this theory, male animals in particular showed heritable features acquired by sexual selection, such as [...] "weapons" [...] with which to fight over females with other males, or beautiful plumage with which to woo the female animals. Much of Descent is devoted to providing evidence for sexual selection in nature, which he also ties into the development of aesthetic instincts in human beings, as well as the differences in coloration between the human races.|$|E

When resources are dispersed, unpredictable, concealed and consumption is immediate the context is less contestable.

Different social structures evolved to solve these different problems. The relationship between the contestability of the resource context and the emergent social structure was tested with an experiment employing 114 subjects in 21 trials.
