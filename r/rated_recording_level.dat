Can a European unemployment insurance scheme help to absorb asymmetric shocks and bring about the desired level of macroeconomic stabilisation? What should such an unemployment benefi t system look like? The contributions to this Forum explore the benefi ts expected from a European unemployment insurance scheme and discuss the diffi culties in establishing such a policy. © 2014 ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} check the {{nonlinearity}} of the Phillips curve in Tunisia for the 1993 – 2012 period, relying on a hybrid new Keynesian Phillips curve modeled via a Logistic Smooth Transition Regression (LSTR) model with endogenous variables. We estimate this model using the nonlinear instrumental variables. The empirical results corroborate the new Keynesian assumption ofprice rigidity and show that the response of inflation to the output gap tends to be significant only if the inflation rate tends to be relatively high and exceeds a certain threshold. For a low inflation rate, the price rigidity dominates. This result is particularly evident in Tunisia, especially for the years following the 2011 revolution during which the elasticity of inflation rate to an excess demand has become highly important and the inflation <b>rate</b> experienced <b>record</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R
40|$|Underemployment, {{insecurity}} and downward mobility {{have become the}} norm for {{young people in the}} UK today. Despite supplanting youth unemployment, unfortunately all of the political parties appear to be blissfully ignorant of the issue. A major underlying theme of Coalition policy has been to implement cuts that can save money immediately but which will almost certainly result in increased public expenditure in the future. The predictions made by Bob Coles in IDOW I have taken hold, including increasing youth unemployment and associated benefits costs. On the surface we do indeed appear to have returned to the 1980 s where young people are concerned. Educational exclusion rates have consistently fallen under the Coalition and now so too, apparently, are NEET (not in education, employment or training) <b>rates.</b> After <b>record</b> <b>levels</b> of youth unemployment in the UK and globally during the first years of their government, 1 million young people remain unemployed, with almost a third looking for work for more than a year...|$|R
40|$|Background: With {{respect to}} the {{importance}} of recording diagnosis in patients' medical data for educational, research and legal and statistic aspects, we designed a study on patients' medical records that were hospitalized in Kashan's hospitals in 1381. Material and methods : This study was performed on medical files of 51 specialists working in Kashan University of Medical Sciences. Totally, 1071 medical records which were selected randomly, averagely 21 records for each physician, were included. We used the list of standard principle of International Classification of Disease (ICD- 10). Data extracted and separated according to each hospital and clinical field. Results: Data were recorded correctly in diagnosis, orders, and external events, 87, 77, and 65, respectively. The <b>rate</b> of diagnosis <b>records</b> were in its high level in Matini hospital (92), and were in lowest range in Naqavi hospital. The <b>rate</b> of order <b>records</b> were 95 in Shahid Beheshti and in lowest range in Naqavi hospital (72. 9). The rate of principle of external events records were in highest range in Shahid Beheshti hospital (77. 8) and in lowest range in Matini hospital (50). Conclusion: We found the <b>rate</b> of <b>recording</b> <b>level</b> was good. It is correlated with attention of specialist and supervisor of medical data committee of university...|$|R

Major findings were that over the period from calf birth to weaning, while calves and their dams grazing together had similar numbers of trypanosome infections detected, the Trypanosoma vivax : T. congolense rations were very different: 1 : 0. 7 in calves and 1 : 2. 8 in cows. This indicated that some ability to control the development of parasitaemia following T. vivax infection might be being acquired, from weaning onwards. Table 1 summarizes the data on trypanosome infection, curative drug treatment, PCV value and performance trait levels in the 458 pre-weaner calves, the 458 lactating cows and the 1028 cow-year reproduction records available over the 5 -year period.

40|$|In recent years, {{increasing}} numbers of asylum-seekers from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador crossed into the United States, fleeing gang violence that has driven homicide <b>rates</b> to <b>record</b> <b>levels.</b> These countries, known collectively as the “Northern Triangle,” now make {{up one of the}} most violent regions in the world. Transcending petty crime, gangs control entire communities in the Northern Triangle where they operate as de facto governments beyond law enforcement’s control. Gangs practice forced recruitment in these communities, creating a join-or-die gang culture where resisting recruitment is tantamount to opposition. Opposition, in turn, is met with brutal retaliation. The {{young men and women who}} refuse to join are fleeing to the United States and seeking asylum. However, United States courts routinely reject these asylum applicants under a restrictive interpretation of political asylum, failing to recognize the current realities of gang culture in the Northern Triangle. This Comment reviews gang-based political asylum claims under the courts’ restrictive interpretation, analyzes these cases in their socio-political context, and explores a path to political asylum under a holistic asylum framework. Ultimately, this Comment advocates for an approach that properly accounts for the socio-political realities of the region while realigning federal asylum law with its original humanitarian and protective purpose...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityIn {{health care}} {{treatment}} disparities persist which represents a major {{health and social}} challenge. As our country's jobless <b>rate</b> soars to <b>record</b> <b>levels,</b> many have experienced the reality of trying to obtain health care and insurance that is too expensive or not available. The reality is people are dying {{because of lack of}} health care from preventable causes. Two models of care that currently exist to provide care for the uninsured population will be acknowledged and discussed. Safety net clinics and academic nurse managed centers (ANMCs) represent innovative ways to care for the uninsured which helps to bridge a health care system gap. Greater emphasis will be on the ANMC model, for the continuum of direct care, clinical practice, and research contributes to the development of heightened student awareness of the uninsured needs though socialization, understanding and skill in human diversity and sensitivity. Nurse Practitioners (NPs) can aim to make a real difference of service by participating and building relationships in their communities which can have an impact and improve the lives of the patients in the short term until the fight for long term systemic health reform is achieved. We are at a crucial juncture in the health policy debate for the best strategies to provide universal coverage...|$|R

40|$|In {{the period}} since 1990, assault and sexual assault <b>rates</b> <b>recorded</b> {{significant}} long term upward trends whilst the other eight offences analysed {{in this report}} were trending down or stable. Abstract Aim: The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyse the trends in the <b>rates</b> of annual <b>recorded</b> incidents of 10 categories of property and violent crime for the period 1990 to 2014 in New South Wales (NSW). Method: Offence rates were calculated using criminal incident data from the NSW Police Force Computerised Operational Policing System (COPS) for the period 1995 to 2014, and the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research’s recorded crime statistics report series for the period 1990 to 1994. Kendall’s trend test was run on the 24 annual rates for each of the 10 offence categories. Results: Some categories of crime in NSW are now at the lowest <b>recorded</b> <b>levels</b> they have been for over 20 years. Comparing per capita rates of crime in 2014 with per capita rates in 1990, lower rates were found for: motor vehicle theft (79 % lower), robbery with a firearm (76 % lower), break and enter non-dwelling (73 % lower), break and enter dwelling (55 % lower), robbery without a weapon (50 % lower), murder (42 % lower) and robbery with a weapon not a firearm (40 % lower). Three of the ten offence types analysed in this report were found to have <b>recorded</b> <b>rates</b> higher in 2014 than in 1990 : sexual assault (132 % higher), other sexual offences (96 % higher) and assault (67 % higher). Conclusion: In the period since 1990, assault and sexual assault <b>rates</b> <b>recorded</b> significant long term upward trends whilst the other eight offences analysed in this report were trending down or stable. The 2014 <b>recorded</b> sexual assault <b>rate</b> was marginally below the highest in that series (occurring in 2012) and the rate since 2000 has recorded a significant uptrend. Apart from sexual assault and other sexual offences, the remaining eight offence types recorded significant downtrends in <b>recorded</b> <b>rates</b> since 2000.

40|$|Emotion {{recognition}} in real-life conditions faces several challenging factors, which most {{studies on emotion}} recognition do not consider. Such factors include background noise, varying <b>recording</b> <b>levels,</b> and acoustic properties of the environment, for example. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of the influence of background noise of various types and SNRs, as well as <b>recording</b> <b>level</b> variations on the performance of automatic emotion recognition from speech. Both, natural and spontaneous as well as acted/prototypical emotions are considered. Besides the well known influence of additive noise, a significant influence of the <b>recording</b> <b>level</b> on the recognition performance is observed. Multi-condition learning with various noise types and <b>recording</b> <b>levels</b> is proposed as a way to increase robustness of methods based on standard acoustic feature sets and commonly used classifiers. It is compared to matched conditions learning and is found to be almost on par for many settings...|$|R
30|$|For our analysis, {{we follow}} 30 OECD countries, {{out of which}} 21 have {{implemented}} minimum wages, between 2000 and 2014. Using information from governmental statistics and OECD publications, {{we are able to}} define the use and, if relevant, the level of youth minimum wages compared to uniform minimum wages and to the median wage. More specifically, we construct series of youth <b>rates</b> by <b>recording</b> the <b>level</b> of wage that is eligible at each age. We complement these data with data on the employment, labor force participation, and unemployment level of 5 -year age interval categories—all derived from the official OECD database. Our focus is on cross-country differences in the age profiles of employment, labor force participation, and unemployment rates that {{can be explained by the}} use of uniform and youth minimum wages. By controlling for interacted country and year fixed effects, we effectively compare the relative labor market position of young individuals with the relative labor market position of young individuals in other countries. In doing so, the key assumption we need to make is that minimum wage settings are not correlated with other labor market institutions that determine labor market outcomes of young individuals. We therefore restrict our sample to young individuals below the age of 35; this setup corresponds to a regression discontinuity design wherein young individuals may face similar youth policies but are either located to the left or the right of the age cutoff-point that determines whether youth or adult minimum wages prevail.|$|R
