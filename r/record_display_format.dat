The project was managed using a partnership arrangement between the four EPR systems vendors who agreed to collaborate and the project team. It lasted one year and consisted of an iterative design process followed by creation of message generation and reading modules within the collaborating EPR systems according to a software requirement specification created by the project team. The paper describes the creation of a common <b>record</b> <b>display</b> <b>format,</b> the implementation of transfer using a floppy disk in the lab, and considers the further barriers before a national implementation might be achieved...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of an electronic primary flight <b>display</b> <b>format</b> aligned with the aircraft velocity vector, a simulation evaluation comparing this format with an electronic attitude-aligned primary flight <b>display</b> <b>format,</b> and a flight evaluation of the velocity-vector-aligned <b>display</b> <b>format</b> are described. Earlier tests in turbulent conditions with the electronic attitude-aligned <b>display</b> <b>format</b> had exhibited unsteadiness. A primary objective of aligning the <b>display</b> <b>format</b> with the velocity vector was {{to take advantage of}} a velocity-vector control-wheel steering system to provide steadiness of display during turbulent conditions. Better situational awareness under crosswind conditions was also achieved. The evaluation task was a curved, descending approach with turbulent and crosswind conditions. Primary flight <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> contained computer-drawn perspective runway images and flight-path angle information. The flight tests were conducted aboard the NASA Transport Systems Research Vehicle (TSRV). Comparative results of the simulation and flight tests were principally obtained from subjective commentary.

40|$|During a Space Shuttle mission, astronauts in {{the cockpit}} can view any {{one of dozens of}} <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> {{containing}} vehicle and mission-critical information. During launch, for example, the crew may view a <b>display</b> <b>format</b> showing tank pressures associated with the main engines. During orbit, the crew no longer needs main engine data, and might instead call up a <b>display</b> <b>format</b> containing details of the robotic arm that controls the payload. In the original cockpit, <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> were viewed on four cathode ray tubes (CRTs). In part due to the limitations of the CRTs, the <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> were monochrome and mostly text-based, with almost no graphical content. Currently, the cockpit of each Space Shuttle is being upgraded. A key aspect of the upgrades is the replacement of the four CRTs with 11 color liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The new LCDs have greatly expanded graphics capabilities compared to the CRTs. However, the <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> presented on the LCDs are largely identical copies of the original <b>display</b> <b>formats.</b> Now that the LCDs have been proven in flight to be reliable and effective, NASA is exploiting the expanded color and graphics capabilities of the LCDs to design a new generation of more userfriendly <b>display</b> <b>formats.</b> The proposed formats make systematic and logical use of color.

Two workstation experiments were conducted. The first experiment determined if including expected-value-range information in traditional parameter <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> affected subject performance. The second experiment determined if using a nontraditional parameter <b>display</b> <b>format,</b> which presented relative deviation from expected value, was better than traditional formats with expected-value ranges included. The inclusion of expected-value-range information onto traditional parameter formats {{was found to have}} essentially no effect. However, subjective results indicated support for including this information. The nontraditional column deviation parameter <b>display</b> <b>format</b> resulted in significantly fewer errors compared with traditional formats with expected-value-ranges included. In addition, error rates for the column deviation parameter <b>display</b> <b>format</b> remained stable as the scenario complexity increased, whereas error rates for the traditional parameter <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> with expected-value ranges increased.

40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} {{experiment was}} conducted using the NASA Ames Research Center Vertical Motion Simulator to evaluate two cockpit <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> designed for manual control on steep instrument approaches for a civil transport tiltrotor aircraft. The first display included a four-cue (pitch, roll, power lever position, and nacelle angle movement prompt) flight director. The second <b>display</b> <b>format</b> provided instantaneous {{flight path angle}} information together with other symbols for terminal area guidance. Pilots evaluated these <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> for an instrument approach task which required a level flight conversion from airplane-mode flight to helicopter-mode flight while decelerating to the nominal approach airspeed. Pilots tracked glide slopes of 6, 9, 15 and 25 degrees, terminating in a hover for a vertical landing on a 150 feet square vertipad. Approaches were conducted with low visibility and ceilings and with crosswinds and turbulence, with all aircraft systems functioning normally and were carried through to a landing. Desired approach and tracking performance was achieved with generally satisfactory handling qualities using either <b>display</b> <b>format</b> on glide slopes up through 15 degrees. Evaluations with both <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> for a 25 degree glide slope revealed serious problems with glide slope tracking at low airspeeds in crosswinds {{and the loss of}} the intended landing spot from the cockpit field of view...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} at hand identifies and analyzes {{how well}} glider pilots use low-cost collision alerting systems. While being generally {{recognized as a}} commendable tool for helping glider pilots see and avoid other traffic, these systems have been cited as possible contributing factors in several accidents. In literature, no in-depth research on how glider pilots may interpret or misinterpret their indications was found. At {{the beginning of this}} dissertation, a market study of human-machine interfaces for low-cost collision alerting systems is presented. During the study, different human-machine interfaces are taxonomized. The low-complexity and radar-style displays were found to be popular <b>display</b> <b>formats.</b> Also it was discovered that a perspective presentation of traffic has been evaluated for military applications, but not for a gliding context. Thus, a perspective presentation of traffic is proposed. The prototype of a perspective <b>display</b> <b>format</b> for gliding is developed by relying on a user-centered design process. Then, the design features of the low-complexity, radar-style and perspective displays are compared. This results in several hypotheses comparing the usability of the three <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> being postulated. In order to experimentally evaluate these hypotheses, 137 glider pilots partake in a laboratory experiment. They are presented with traffic information on one of the three <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> installed in a flight simulator. The participants then indicate where they suspect the traffic to be located in the outside world while being exposed to different flight conditions. Performance and subjective satisfaction measurements are recorded during the experiment. Inferential statistics are used to evaluate the experimental data. The perspective <b>display</b> <b>format</b> results in the most precise estimates of where traffic is located. Generally, errors in estimating traffic position increase as the participants’ ownship deviates from straight and level flight. Reaction time does not vary notably between <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> or different flight conditions. Subjective learnability and usability ratings favor the perspective <b>display</b> <b>format</b> over the two other formats analyzed. Overall, the perspective <b>display</b> <b>format</b> exhibits optimized usability in all dimensions when compared to the other two formats. During the usability analysis, circumstantial evidence arises which suggests that not all participants might interpret the data shown on their display similarly. A probable cause for this may be different knowledge deficits which are experienced between participants. These deficits may result in participants mentally modeling the collision alerting system incorrectly, thus leading to incorrect coordinate systems for interpreting the traffic information. A method for identifying these mental models is developed. The ensuing analysis reveals that most participants using low-complexity or radar-style <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> incorrectly interpret traffic information in an ownship-fixed fashion. Contrary, most participants working with the perspective <b>display</b> <b>format</b> perform {{at least some of the}} required rotations of their personal coordinate systems. The concept of different mental models based on different personal coordinate systems shows potential as an analysis tool for future display designs. From these findings multiple recommendations are deduced. They are directed at different stakeholders in the gliding community, including glider pilots, aircraft owners and operators, regulatory authorities, glider manufacturers, flight schools, competition rule makers and organizers, as well as designers of collision alerting systems and associated human-machine interfaces. Closing this dissertation, the potential for future human factors research in the gliding community is highlighted...|$|R
