5000|$|Unlike {{some other}} e-mail client {{software}} programs, IBM Notes developers {{made a choice}} to not allow individual users {{to determine whether a}} <b>return</b> <b>receipt</b> is sent when they open an e-mail; rather, that option is configured at the server level. IBM developers believe [...] "Allowing individual cancellation of <b>return</b> <b>receipt</b> violates the intent of a <b>return</b> <b>receipt</b> function within an organization". So, depending on system settings, users will have no choice in <b>return</b> <b>receipts</b> going back to spammers or other senders of unwanted e-mail. This has led tech sites to publish ways to get around this feature of Notes. For IBM Notes 9.0 and IBM iNotes 9.0, the IBM Domino server's [...]INI file can now contain an entry to control <b>return</b> <b>receipt</b> in a manner that's more aligned with community expectations (IBM Notes 9 Product Documentation).|$|R
5000|$|A {{non-standard}} but {{widely used}} way to request <b>return</b> <b>receipts</b> {{is with the}} [...] "Return-Receipt-To:" [...] (RRT) e-mail header. An e-mail address is specified as {{the content of the}} header. The first time a user opens an e-mail message containing this header, the client will typically prompt the user whether or not to send a <b>return</b> <b>receipt.</b>|$|R

The data communications will enable ground automated <b>message</b> generation and <b>receipt,</b> <b>message</b> routing and transmission, and direct communications with aircraft avionics.|$|R
5000|$|Certified Mail {{can be done}} {{either with}} or without [...] "return receipt requested", often called [...] "RRR", which costs an {{additional}} fee. The <b>return</b> <b>receipt</b> is a green postcard-sized paper that is mailed back to the sender by the post office upon receipt by the addressee as proof of delivery. Today the USPS new <b>Return</b> <b>Receipt</b> Electronic (RRE) provides electronic proof of delivery information. When the letter reaches its final delivery destination the letter carrier captures the signature of the person that accepts the letter and the information is electronically stored. As indicated on the <b>return</b> <b>receipt</b> card, either the addressee or the addressee's [...] "agent" [...] may sign for the document.|$|R

40|$|Mail surveys {{remain an}} {{effective}} and popular mode of data collection, given the relatively low and decreasing response rates of Web surveys (Sheehan 2001) and the unreliability of e-mail addresses as compared to physical addresses (Crawford et al. 2002; Shannon and Bradshow 2002). This article addresses the implications of using return receipts/address updates to reduce the costs of self-administered mail surveys at Penn State Harrisburg (PSH). We build upon Dillman’s (1991, 2000) widely-used approach of multiple contact surveys to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and improvement in completion rates using <b>return</b> <b>receipts.</b> We found that having valid addresses {{has the potential of}} reducing costs associated with a mail survey (e. g. copy costs, postage, etc.). However, in determining the efficacy of the <b>return</b> <b>receipt</b> method a priori, two features of the survey must be considered: (1) the relative cost between the <b>return</b> <b>receipt</b> and the additional mailings, and (2) the ratio between usable (deliverable) and non-usable (un-deliverable) addresses (see appendix for a model that demonstrate...|$|R

5000|$|The {{broker in}} a pub/sub {{system may be}} {{designed}} to deliver messages for a specified time, but then stop attempting delivery, {{whether or not it}} has received confirmation of successful <b>receipt</b> of the <b>message</b> by all subscribers. A pub/sub system designed in this way cannot guarantee delivery of messages to any applications that might require such assured delivery. Tighter coupling of the designs of such a publisher and subscriber pair must be enforced outside of the pub/sub architecture to accomplish such assured delivery (e.g. by requiring the subscriber to publish <b>receipt</b> <b>messages).</b>|$|R

Bell responded with evidence including their marriage license, their daughter's birth certificate, Bell's last will and testament, bank records, family photos, and Social Security forms.

25|$|The MPS also {{supports}} mail delivery for U.S. diplomatic facilities overseas and to deployed personnel in combat zones worldwide. Most USPS extra services, such as Certified Mail, registered mail, delivery confirmation, insured mail, certificate of mailing, <b>return</b> <b>receipt,</b> restricted delivery and <b>return</b> <b>receipt</b> for merchandise {{are available to}} the MPS. Mail sent from one military post office (MPO) to another MPO can be sent for free as inner/intra-theater delivery service (IDS) {{as long as it}} does not transit the United States. Military postage rates are equivalent to U.S. domestic postage rates because the Services pay the second destination transportation (SDT) costs to, from, and between MPOs. The postage paid on mail to/from MPOs only covers the cost of transporting the mail within the U.S. All military mail between the U.S. and overseas locations is subject to customs inspection in the country of destination, and customs declarations must normally be attached to packages and larger mail pieces.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the message}} is displayed, the {{recipient}} (such as the elderly or shut-ins) can confirm the <b>receipt</b> of the <b>message.</b> If the <b>message</b> <b>receipt</b> is not triggered within a specified timeframe, the sender would receive an e-mail alert to notify them of possible problems so the recipient can be contacted directly.|$|R

50|$|This is in {{contrast}} with a physical delivery medium in which a courier {{acting on behalf of}} the sender can honor the sender's requirements for delivery - including hand-delivery of the message to the recipient and even requiring that recipient to authenticate himself to the courier before receiving the message.

For this reason, many experts eschew the term <b>return</b> <b>receipt</b> in connection with e-mail, in favor of less misleading terms.|$|R
