The massive Palace of Concerts and Sports and Žalgiris Stadium are other relics of Žirmūnai's Soviet history. Žirmūnai was important to the industrial sector in the USSR; since that time, this function has been replaced or supplanted by newer businesses, including some of Lithuania's leading companies.|$|E

With financial backing from its partners and tax breaks for new <b>residential</b> <b>construction</b> passed in 2000, construction began on November 28, 2001. BACE Construction (Philadelphia based) was awarded the construction of the project.

40|$|Recently, an {{increasing}} number of green residential buildings have been developed worldwide owing to active promotion from the authorities and increasing interest from customers. However, {{in the same way as}} traditional <b>residential</b> buildings, the <b>construction</b> of green <b>residential</b> buildings faces various risks. The aims of this study are to identify and assess the diverse risks in green <b>residential</b> building <b>construction</b> projects, compare their risk criticalities with those in traditional counterparts, and propose helpful risk mitigation measures. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive literature review was first conducted, and a questionnaire was then administered to 30 construction companies in Singapore. Survey results showed that “complex procedures to obtain approvals”, “overlooked high initial cost”, “unclear requirements of owners”, “employment constraint”, and “lack of availability of green materials and equipment” were the top five critical risks in green <b>residential</b> building <b>construction</b> projects. Survey results also showed that green residential building projects were facing risks at a more critical level than those traditional residential building projects. Additionally, this study proposed fourteen risk mitigation measures to tackle the risks in green <b>residential</b> building <b>construction</b> projects. This study has contributed to the body of knowledge by identifying and evaluating the critical risks and mitigation measures in green <b>residential</b> building <b>construction</b> projects. Meanwhile, the findings from this study can also provide an in-depth understanding of risk management in green <b>residential</b> building <b>construction</b> projects to practitioners and thus benefit the practice...|$|R
