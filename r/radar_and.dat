5|$|The {{earliest}} search radars installed {{were the}} SK air-search <b>radar</b> <b>and</b> SG surface-search radar during World War II. They were {{located on the}} mainmast and forward fire-control tower of the battleships, respectively. As the war drew to a close, the United States introduced the SK-2 air-search <b>radar</b> <b>and</b> SG surface-search radar; the Iowa class was updated {{to make use of}} these systems between 1945 and 1952. At the same time, the ships' radar systems were augmented with the installation of the SP height finder on the main mast. In 1952, AN/SPS-10 surface-search <b>radar</b> <b>and</b> AN/SPS-6 air-search radar replaced the SK and SG radar systems, respectively. Two years later the SP height finder was replaced by the AN/SPS-8 height finder, which was installed on the main mast of the battleships.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, radar made {{camouflage}} {{generally less}} effective, though coastal boats are sometimes painted like land vehicles. Aircraft camouflage too {{came to be}} seen as less important because of <b>radar,</b> <b>and</b> aircraft of different air forces, such as the Royal Air Force's Lightning, were often uncamouflaged.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} {{laboratory}} assistants, Professor Bernard Quatermass anxiously awaits {{the return to}} Earth of his new rocket ship and its crew, who have become the first humans to travel into space.

5|$|In addition, {{ground and}} {{satellite}} based imagery, <b>radar,</b> <b>and</b> lidar {{can be used}} to detect ash clouds. This information is passed between meteorological agencies, volcanic observatories and airline companies through Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAAC). There is one VAAC for each of the nine regions of the world. VAACs can issue advisories describing the current and future extent of the ash cloud.|$|E
