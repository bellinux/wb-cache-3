40|$|Abstract: White sharks show a {{high degree}} of {{residency}} to specific aggregation sites, to which they return regularly over multiple years. Australian research has historically focused on single aggregation areas within each of the southern states where white sharks occur, but other key habitats likely exist and if so, will be important to identify to effectively monitor and protect threatened white shark populations. This study is the first to describe Liguanea Island as a second white shark aggregation site within South Australia, with <b>residency</b> <b>periods</b> and return visits recorded by multiple individuals. Eight sharks were detected at both Liguanea Island and the other known aggregation area in the state, the Neptune Islands, dem-onstrating movement between these locations. Sustained <b>residency</b> <b>periods</b> were recorded at both sites, although high pe-riodic site fidelity was apparent with many individuals showing preference for the location at which they were tagged. In-dividual differences in site fidelity and residency patterns were found, although two sub-adult individuals were found to follow similar movement patterns. The implications of white shark movements, and the suggested identification of a sec-ond aggregation areas in close proximity are discussed...|$|R

Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr of the Afrikaner Bond persuaded Kruger to make this fully retrospective (to immediately enfranchise all white men in the country seven years or more), but Milner and the South African League deemed this insufficient. After Kruger rejected the British proposal of a joint commission on the franchise law, Smuts and Reitz proposed a five-year retroactive franchise and the extension of a quarter of the volksraad seats to the Witwatersrand region, on the condition that Britain drop any claim to suzerainty.

40|$|Stopover {{behaviour}} is {{a central}} element of migration strategies. But in recent geolocator studies, despite now being able to track individual songbirds during their entire migration, their stopover behaviour has received little attention. We used light-sensitive geolocators to identify the migratory routes and schedules of 12 northern wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) breeding in Sweden. Three geolocators collected temperature data complementing inferences from light data by providing additional information on behaviour during migration. The wheatears performed a slow migration with considerable stopover time (84 %/ 76 % of autumn/spring migration), with short stops while traveling through Europe, and a prolonged stopover period in both autumn and spring in the Mediterranean region. Spring migration was faster than autumn migration, mainly because of decreased stopover time. Migration routes and time schedules {{were similar to those}} from a German breeding population. Compared to wheatears breeding in Alaska with a three-fold migration distance, Swedish wheatears spent more time during stopovers during autumn and spring migration, suggesting less time constraints and potential flexibility in migration schedules. The finding of prolonged stopovers, similar to other recent geolocator studies, shows that temporary <b>residency</b> <b>periods</b> may be common. This changes our current view on stopover ecology to one where temporary <b>residency</b> <b>periods</b> are part of spatio-temporal strategies optimising resource use during the entire annual cycle...|$|R
40|$|Background: Phylloquinone, {{found in}} dark-green {{vegetables}} and certain plant oils, {{is the primary}} dietary source of the fat-soluble vitamin K. Limited {{data suggest that the}} relative bioavailability of phylloquinone from vegetables is lower than that from a supplement. This finding is relevant to the mainte-nance of optimal vitamin K status. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} compare, in younger and older adults, the relative bioavailability of phyllo-quinone from a vegetable with that of a fortified oil. Design: In a crossover design with three 15 -d <b>residency</b> <b>periods</b> in a metabolic unit, younger and older men and women (n = 36) consumed a mixed diet containing 100 mg phylloquinone/d. Dur-ing 2 <b>residency</b> <b>periods,</b> the mixed diet was supplemented for 5 d with either broccoli (377 mg phylloquinone/d; broccoli diet) or phylloquinone-fortified oil (417 mg/d; oil diet). The relative bioavailability of phylloquinone was defined by the difference in plasma phylloquinone, percentage serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%ucOC), and urinary g-carboxyglutamic acid in response to 5 d of supplementation. Results: For both younger and older adults, plasma phylloqui-none concentrations were higher (P < 0. 001) and %ucOC values were lower (P = 0. 001) after the broccoli and oil diets than after the mixed diet only. Overall, the response to broccoli supple-mentation was not significantly different from the response to the fortified oil in either age group. Urinary g-carboxyglutamic acid did not change in response to supplementation. Conclusions: There was no significant difference in the relative bioavailability of phylloquinone, as evidenced by the lack of a significant difference in plasma phylloquinone and %ucOC between the 2 groups after either the broccoli or oil diets for younger and older adults.

Restocking of depleted populations has been extensively studied for commercially or recreationally important teleost fish species; however, it has, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, never been successfully attempted and assessed on sharks. We evaluated whether fifteen captive-bred wobbegongs (Orectolobus maculatus) released into a small bay inhabited by wild sharks would survive and remain within a small ‘no-take’ marine reserve. The captive-bred sharks and twelve wild sharks were tagged with acoustic transmitters and their presence was monitored by an array of acoustic receivers. The detection rate of control tags was modelled against environmental variables to predict detection probabilities and account for days when environmental conditions hampered shark detections. The overall detection probability ranged from 28 % to 38 % and was most affected by wind direction. Wild wobbegongs showed clear seasonal patterns of attendance to the study site, with the highest probability of presence during the summer months. The captive-bred sharks did not display the same seasonal trend in occurrence.

40|$|This {{study found}} {{evidence}} of intermittent, multi-year <b>residency</b> <b>periods</b> in northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) using stable isotope ratios in vibrissae and canine teeth. Northern fur seals migrate from the Bering Sea during summer months to lower latitudes and slightly warmer waters of the northeastern Pacific Ocean and California Current in the winter. To determine {{the length of time}} spent away from the Bering Sea, growth rate was estimated using the covarying oscillations δ 13 C and δ 15 N, estimated to be 0. 09 mm/day. The δ 13 C and δ 15 N in vibrissae from 30 male fur seals showed a minimum of 13 separate periods of stable covariance covering 3. 25 + cm, indicating at least 1 year in warmer, less productive waters of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The vibrissae isotope ratios were used in conjunction with δ 18 O from tooth dentin growth layer groups of 20 male northern fur seals; they showed significant enrichment in δ 18 O in 50 % of the animals at age 1 - 2 years, which indicates extended periods of time spent in lower latitudes in the North Pacific Ocean as δ 18 O is typically enriched in warmer, less productive waters. Significant changes in δ 18 O were found to be ~ 0. 2 ‰ enrichment per 10 º south latitude, while longitude was found to have 0. 2 ‰ enrichment per 50 ˚ East longitude. These data show that latitudinal changes, those related to the southerly migration from the Bering Sea to the northeastern Pacific Ocean, are a stronger factor in the shifts in dentinal δ 18 O than longitudinal shifts. These intermittent periods of occupation are important when estimating population abundance of northern fur seals, especially pups and juveniles...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the links}} between {{external}} variables such as habitat and interactions with conspecifics and animal space-use is fundamental to developing effective management measures. In the marine realm, automated acoustic tracking has become a widely used method for monitoring the movement of free-ranging animals, yet researchers generally lack robust methods for analysing the resulting spatial-usage data. In this study, acoustic tracking data from male and female broadnose sevengill sharks Notorynchus cepedianus, collected {{in a system of}} coastal embayments in southeast Tasmania were analyzed to examine sex-specific differences in the sharks 2 ̆ 7 coastal space-use and test novel methods for the analysis of acoustic telemetry data. Sex-specific space-use of the broadnose sevengill shark from acoustic telemetry data was analysed in two ways: The recently proposed spatial network analysis of between-receiver movements was employed to identify sex-specific space-use patterns. To include the full breadth of temporal information held in the data, movements between receivers were furthermore considered as transitions between states of a Markov chain, with the resulting transition probability matrix allowing the ranking of the relative importance of different parts of the study area. Both spatial network and Markov chain analysis revealed sex-specific preferences of different sites within the study area. The identification of priority areas differed for the methods, {{due to the fact that}} in contrast to network analysis, our Markov chain approach preserves the chronological sequence of detections and accounts for both <b>residency</b> <b>periods</b> and movements.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2017 Steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss exhibit complex life-history {{patterns}} {{described by}} variable freshwater and marine <b>residency</b> <b>periods,</b> maturation patterns, and reproductive characteristics. Over 300 small populations of Steelhead {{are present in}} Southeast Alaska, and similar trends in abundance among these populations suggest the influence of population-regulating forces operating on a regional scale. The Situk River, near Yakutat, Alaska, supports the largest known population of Steelhead in Alaska. Stock assessment studies on this river have collected the longest set of biological data and scale samples for Steelhead in the state. For this study, retrospective scale pattern analysis of samples from Situk River Steelhead was synthesized with regional abundance information to investigate patterns in early marine growth among different life-history and demographic groups, {{as well as to}} explore linkages between growth, abundance, and marine environmental variables. Positive correlations were identified between freshwater growth, first ocean-year growth, and adult length, while first ocean-year growth was negatively correlated with second ocean-year growth. Early maturing Steelhead were found to have increased first ocean-year growth and reduced adult length relative to later maturing Steelhead, confirming connections between growth and maturation. Correlations in abundance among Southeast Alaska Steelhead populations suggest that marine and climatic drivers may impact these populations in a regionally coherent manner. Correlations among patterns in abundance also varied along a distance gradient: populations located closer to the Situk River were more correlated with the Situk River than more distant populations. Positive relationships between Gulf of Alaska sea surface temperature, North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, and Situk River Steelhead abundance further supported the importance of climate-driven marine conditions to Steelhead productivity. While conservation concerns for Steelhead in Southeast Alaska are currently minimal, proactive investigations into life-history diversity and population linkages may become more relevant with increased marine ecosystem variability related to climate change...|$|R
