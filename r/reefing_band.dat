40|$|The {{hypothesized}} {{importance of}} mesophotic (30 to 150 m depth) reefs justifies the recent trend in scientific scrutiny of these systems. However, to enable assessment of complex {{concepts such as}} connectivity and reef dynamics, baseline assemblage characteristics must first be established. This study used baited remote underwater video (BRUV) technology to investigate the assemblage structure of predatory and scavenging fishes across 4 mesophotic <b>reef</b> <b>bands</b> at ca. 30 to 82 m depth, at 2 locations 25 km apart in subtropical eastern Australia. We aimed to quantify patterns in predatory and scavenging fish assemblage structure at these reefs across the continental shelf and relate this to putative structuring environmental variables. Strong cross-shelf gradients were identified in species richness and overall assemblage composition. While the pattern of latitudinal affiliation did not change across the shelf, predatory and scavenging fish assemblages at non-adjacent reefs were statistically distinct (PERMANOVA interaction term p = 0. 012), and best (but not well) explained by depth alone (BIOENV ρ = 0. 396). A high proportion (15 to 45 %) of the fish species at each <b>reef</b> <b>band</b> were found only within that band. These cross-shelf trends contrasted with those described from more complex shelf topography such as at the Solitary Islands (250 km south), and did not match published patterns of epibenthic assemblage structure. Our results highlight the need for detailed information on mesophotic reef assemblage structure to support marine conservation and reserve design initiatives, {{rather than relying on}} generalised trends from the literature.

25|$|Late 2000 saw Reef facing {{legal action}} from the U.S. company South Cone Inc. for {{infringement}} of their trademark, Reef Brazil (as found on sandals and footwear), {{on the basis that}} T-shirts, and other merchandising such as stickers, caps and keyrings could cause confusion in the marketplace. The South Cone action failed on account of their mark actually being REEF BRAZIL rather than REEF, and because their primary business and reputation was with the sale of sandals and footwear. Also important to the outcome was the fact that <b>Reef</b> (the <b>band)</b> were using the T-shirts and other items as marketing for the band rather than trying to promote the T-shirts (or any other clothing, including footwear) as a commodity in themselves. <b>Reef</b> (the <b>band)</b> were awarded £1000.|$|R

5000|$|Inspired by punk & {{rock bands}} {{of his high}} school era, Matt Ellis formed Sydney, heavy-rock band Sedgwick Pie in 1995. With Matt as their frontman, Sedgwick Pie {{released}} two EPs, touring with such prominent 90s acts as <b>Reef</b> (<b>band)</b> UK, Grinspoon AUS & Tumbleweed (band) AUS, before launching his solo career in 2000 with his critically acclaimed debut,"Peel". Release of this album quickly established Ellis on an international stage, with the album sitting in the top 10 on ninemsn for six weeks. The self-produced music video for the title track [...] "Peel", gained airplay on Foxtel's Country Music Channel, MTV Australia, Rage (TV program) and defunct, late-night TV show on Network Ten, Ground Zero. The track was added to rotation in South East Asia, but was eventually banned after outraged viewers called in to complain that the clip - which featured Ellis driving around Sydney blindfolded - promoted reckless driving. The banning sparked an invitation from Channel V Asia for Ellis to interview and perform live at the station in Hong Kong. This performance wrapped the Peel tour which saw Matt Ellis perform at respected rock music venues CBGBs (RIP) NYC & the Knitting Factory LA.|$|R

40|$|Geological {{complexity}} {{has always}} been a large contributor to instabilities at the mines on the Far West Rand. Part of the problem lies in the unknown nature of many of the rock types and formations that overlie or underlie the conglomerate <b>reef</b> <b>bands</b> within the rockmass. One of these little known rock types is the highly altered Westonaria Formation Lavas (WAF), which has impacted significantly on the stability, production sustainability and the rock engineering designs at many of the mines in the area. The Ya Rona Shaft Pillar Extraction is one of the mining operations where WAF has determined the course of many interventions. Failure of the WAF has occurred at mines that had not identified it as a potential hazard, which has led to large-scale fall-outs, significant damage to excavations, particularly shafts, and more importantly, operational downtime. Under this risk profile, Ya Rona shaft {{would not be able to}} sustain a profitable production profile should failure of the WAF occur. This research report investigates the WAF rock type, why it poses such a threat to stability, and how it influences rock engineering design where it is encountered. Using the available literature, rockmass rating systems and numerical modelling of the Ya Rona Shaft Pillar Extraction, classification of WAF will be attempted. Moreover, the research report will show what mitigation measures may be required to achieve stability under the WAF conditions, and also provide a guideline for rock engineering design under WAF conditions within a shaft pillar extraction...|$|R

40|$|As {{most of the}} South African {{gold mines}} near their end of life, {{with regards to the}} {{original}} reef horizons and ore bodies planned, {{a large portion of the}} gold bearing ore lie in isolated blocks of ground which were left behind for various reasons. These blocks of ground are now being investigated with the intention of extraction together with other low grade ore bodies or <b>reef</b> <b>bands.</b> Although, the cost of gold mining has risen substantially, the price received for the finished product has also risen considerably over the past decade and it is still one of the most stable forms of long term investment (World Gold Council, 2013). Thuthukani Shaft, KDC has been mining isolated blocks of ground over the past decade with improving success. This research report details investigations into the continuously improving support systems that have been used over time with regards to the mining of isolated blocks of ground and seismic activity. The investigation reflect an improving work environment with regards to health and safety and indicates that the support system used at present is capable of preventing damage to workplaces with fairly high seismic activity. The report contains an analysis of seismic activity with regards to injury and damage to workplaces in relation to the improvements made to the support system over time at Thuthukani Shaft, KDC.

40|$|The Asterinidae in {{tropical}} regions includes morphospecies complexes in the genera Aquilonastra and Cryptasterina. Cryptic species in these genera {{have been discovered}} based on differences in life histories and by attention to previously poorly investigated habitats. Two species with benthic development occur in the intertidal rubble habitat at One Tree Island, southern Great Barrier Reef Aquilonastra byrneae (O 2 ̆ 7 Loughlin and Rowe, 2006) has oral gonopores {{and is likely to}} lay benthic eggs masses. The presence of mature gonads in May and June indicates that egg masses should be present in winter. This species may be a protandric hermaphrodite. Cryptasterina sp. is an intragonadal brooder and may be conspecific with the coastal Cryptasterina hystera Dartnall and Byrne, 2003. This species broods its young to the juvenile stage in spring and summer. The juveniles emerge through aboral gonopores. Cryptasterina sp. is a simultaneous hermaphrodite.

40|$|Artificial reefs {{of varied}} {{materials}} {{have been deployed}} worldwide to acquire large and diverse fish assemblages for both commercial and sport fishers, and SCUBA divers. Beginning in 1967, environmental resource managers and local fishers initiated a project to build an artificial <b>reef</b> using <b>banded,</b> but unballasted, waste automobile and truck tires offshore Broward County, Florida, USA. Estimates {{of the number of}} tires placed offshore range between 1, 000, 000 – 2, 000, 000. Since deployment, storm events and ocean currents have caused the bands to give way and the break-up of the reef. Over the years, many tires have washed ashore onto recreational beach areas. Tires that remain in the water continue to move with wave action and currents. Many of these remaining tires have already been forced up against the offshore edge of natural reef with numbers at individual sites estimated in the 100, 0002 ̆ 7 s. The objectives of this project were to examine the feasibility of removing the tires as well as gain subjective insight into the impact of the tires on natural habitat. Sixteen hundred tires were removed from the reef edge and recycled. The potential problems arising from the use of tires in artificial reef construction were apparent. Natural reef fauna was broken and buried providing a seascape resembling a junkyard. The shortsighted use of unstable material to construct artificial reefs is an issue facing many coastal areas. Disturbance of this unstable material has futher added to other natural and anthropogenic stresses suffered by the coral reef systems and the wildlife they support. Clearly, unstable materials, such as tires, are not suitable for artificial reef construction. If already deployed, tires should be removed to prevent physical damage to the natural habitat and reduce the related negative biological impacts, in turn, limiting economic loss to local communities benefiting from use of the natural reef.
