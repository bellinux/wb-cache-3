5|$|As {{noted by}} Copernicus himself, {{the notion that}} the Earth <b>rotates</b> is very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also {{proposed}} that the Earth <b>rotates</b> on its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440). Al-Sijzi also proposed that the Earth <b>rotates</b> on its axis. Empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274) and Ali Qushji (1403–1474).|$|E

5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{classified}} as a BY Draconis variable because it has regions of higher magnetic activity that move {{into and out of}} the line of sight as it <b>rotates.</b> Measurement of this rotational modulation suggests that its equatorial region <b>rotates</b> with an average period of 11.2days, which is less than half of the rotation period of the Sun. Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0.050 in V magnitude due to starspots and other short-term magnetic activity. Photometry has also shown that the surface of Epsilon Eridani, like the Sun, is undergoing differential rotation i.e. the rotation period at equator differs from that at high latitude. The measured periods range from 10.8 to 12.3 days. The axial tilt of Epsilon Eridani toward the line of sight from Earth is highly uncertain: estimates range from 24° to 72°.|$|E

5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one <b>rotates</b> it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer <b>rotates</b> themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system {{can be thought of as}} being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{extends the}} upright face {{detection}} framework proposed by Viola et al. 2001 to handle in-plane <b>rotated</b> faces. These haar-like features work inefficiently on <b>rotated</b> faces, so this paper pro-poses {{a new set}} of ± 26. 565 ◦ haar-like features which can be calculated quickly to represent the features of <b>rotated</b> faces. Unlike previous face detection techniques in training quantities of samples to build different <b>rotated</b> detectors, with these new features, we address to build different <b>rotated</b> detectors by <b>rotating</b> an upright face detector directly so as to achieve in-plane <b>rotated</b> face detection. This approach is selected because of its computational efficiency, simplicity and training time saving. This proposed method is tested on CMU-MIT <b>rotated</b> test data and yields good results in accuracy and maintains speed advantage. ...|$|R

40|$|To avoid {{resonance}} {{problems in}} <b>rotating</b> turbomachinery components such as impellers, {{it is of}} paramount importance to determine the natural frequencies of these parts when they are under operation. Nevertheless, most of these <b>rotating</b> structures are inaccessible and in some cases submerged and confined. To measure the natural frequencies of submerged impellers from the <b>rotating</b> frame is complicated, because sensors have to be well fixed, withstand with large pressure and centrifugal forces. Furthermore, the signals have to be transmitted to the stationary frame. For this reason it may be advantageous to measure the natural frequencies with sensors placed on the casing. In this paper, the analysis of <b>rotating</b> disk-like structures submerged and confined has been performed from the stationary frame. Previously, an analytical model to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the disk from the <b>rotating</b> frame is presented. Once natural frequencies and mode shapes are obtained in the <b>rotating</b> frame, the transmission to the stationary frame has been deduced. A <b>rotating</b> disk test rig has been used for the experimental study. It consist of a <b>rotating</b> disk that has been excited from the <b>rotating</b> frame with a piezoelectric patch and it response has been measured from both <b>rotating</b> and stationary frame.
