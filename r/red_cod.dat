5000|$|P. breviuscula is the {{smallest}} of the <b>red</b> <b>cods</b> with maximum size thought to be approximately 250mm. Other <b>red</b> <b>cods</b> can reach lengths up to 900mm. It was previously confused with P. barbata for some years. It can be identified as separate to P. bachus by the lack of presence of a dark spot {{near the bottom of the}} pectoral fin and displays larger scales than the southern bastard cod. It has two dorsal fins; the anterior being quite short while the posterior dorsal fin stretches more than half the body length. The caudal (tail) fin is rounded and not overly wide. The ventral aspect of the body is described as silver in color while the dorsal section is a pale pink-brownish color. The eyes are large and a barbel is present on the chin.|$|R

5000|$|Hector’s {{dolphins}} are generalist feeders, with prey selection {{based on}} size rather than species. Typically, they feed on smaller prey {{which tend to}} measure under 10 cm. in length. [...] Stomach contents of dissected dolphins have included surface-schooling fish, midwater fish, and squid, and {{a wide variety of}} benthic species. The largest prey item recovered from a Hector’s dolphin stomach was an undigested <b>red</b> <b>cod</b> weighing 500 g with a standard length of 35 cm. Many Hector's dolphins can be observed following fishing trawlers {{as a result of the}} amount of disturbed or escaped flatfish and <b>red</b> <b>cod</b> on which the species typically feed. However, this activity can result in the unwanted bycatching of the species.|$|E

50|$|The use of {{farmed fish}} in the Filet-O-Fish first came about in 1981, when an owner of a New Zealand {{fisheries}} company was dissatisfied with the pollock Filet-O-Fish he purchased at the Courtenay Place, Wellington restaurant. Saying to the manager {{that he could make}} a better-tasting fish fillet, he was handed a box of fillets and told to come back with identical, better-tasting fillets. He substituted <b>red</b> <b>cod</b> for the pollock, and after the manager was satisfied with the better-tasting <b>red</b> <b>cod</b> fillets, ended up in agreement to supply the Courtenay Place restaurant (and eventually several other New Zealand restaurants) with the <b>red</b> <b>cod</b> fillets. The similar-tasting hoki was substituted several years later, due to its competitive market value and its boneless fillets, and eventually was introduced widely in the early 1990s when global pollock stocks were facing low numbers. McDonald's removed the Filet-O-Fish from its menus in the United States on September 26, 1996, and replaced it with the Fish Filet Deluxe sandwich, which was part of McDonald's ill-fated Deluxe line of sandwiches. However, the Filet-O-Fish was brought back to its menus on a gradual basis starting in the middle of 1997, due to overwhelming letters and petitions, receiving the larger fish patty from the Fish Filet Deluxe. The Fish Filet Deluxe itself was discontinued at most restaurants early the next year, while others kept it a little longer until the Fish Filet Deluxe was finally removed in the year 2000.|$|E

25|$|Almost all coral cod, reef cod or rock cod {{are also}} in order Perciformes. Most are better known as groupers, and belong to the family Serranidae. Others belong to the Nototheniidiae. Two {{exceptions}} are the Australasian <b>red</b> rock <b>cod,</b> which belongs to a different order (see below), and the fish known simply as the rock cod and as soft cod in New Zealand, Lotella rhacina, which as noted above actually {{is related to the}} true cod (it is a morid cod).|$|R
50|$|These birds feed by hunting small clupeoid fish, {{cephalopods}} and crustaceans, {{for which}} they travel and dive quite extensively. In New Zealand, important prey items include arrow squid, slender sprat, Graham's gudgeon, <b>red</b> <b>cod</b> and ahuru. Since the year 2000, the little penguins of Port Phillip Bay's diet has consisted mainly of barracouta, anchovy, and arrow squid. Sardines previously featured more prominently in southern Australian little penguin diets prior to mass sardine mortality events of the 1990s. These mass mortality events affected sardine stocks over 5,000 kilometres of coastline.|$|E
50|$|Juveniles {{are thought}} to be pelagic, {{switching}} to demersal when they are about 50 cm in length. They inhabit temperate and subtropical waters of the southern Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean, being found in Chile, southeastern Australia and New Zealand. They can be found in waters between 10 m and 800 m deep, but generally prefer waters deeper than 50 m. They are usually found living in cracks, caverns, or caves when found in shallow waters. They are voracious predators, feeding on a large range of other fish species, invertebrates and crustaceans, including <b>red</b> <b>cod</b> and blue cod, hoki, crabs and crayfish.|$|E
50|$|New Zealand {{sea lions}} {{are known to}} predate {{on a wide range}} of prey species {{including}} fish (e.g. hoki and <b>red</b> <b>cod),</b> cephalopods (e.g. New Zealand arrow squid and yellow octopus), crustaceans, seabirds and other marine mammals. Studies indicate a strong location effect on diet, with almost no overlap in prey species comparing sea lions at Otago Peninsula and Campbell Island, at the north and south extents of the species' breeding range. New Zealand sea lions are in turn predated on by great white sharks, with 27% showing evidence of scarring from near-miss shark attacks in an opportunistic study of adult NZ sea lions at Sandy Bay, Enderby Island.|$|E

In certain parts of New Zealand, where deep oceanic waters meet the shore, dusky dolphins forage in deep scattering layers at night. They arrive at the hunting site individually, but form groups when in the layer. [...] The dolphins use their echolocation to detect and isolate an individual prey. Groups of foraging dolphins tend to increase when the layer is near the surface and decrease when it descends.|$|E

40|$|Thesis by publication. Bibliography: pages 33 - 40. Introduction [...] Methods [...] Results [...] Discussion. Long term {{systematic}} {{monitoring of}} the diet of large marine predators {{can be an effective}} approach to detect and understand changes in ecosystems vulnerable to environmental change. This study quantified seasonal and annual changes in the frequency of occurrence (%FO) of prey items in the diet of Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) in Bass Strait from 1998 to 2014. Using hard part analysis, 71 prey species were identified, with combinations of 8 main species found in more than 70 % of the samples. Otolith measurements suggest Australian fur seals consumed predominantly juvenile fishes. I investigated correlations between environmental variables and %FO using generalised additive models. Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) correlated with the %FO of <b>red</b> <b>cod</b> Pseudophycis bachus, pilchard Sardinops sagax and jack mackerel Trachurus declivis. Positive correlations relating to El Niño conditions were found for both <b>red</b> <b>cod</b> and pilchard and correlation with neutral SOI was found for jack mackerel. Correlations identified between long-term environmental change and prey of marine predators suggests large-scale processes can influence prey assemblages at various trophic levels in Bass Strait.

50|$|They {{were usually}} {{spritsail}} rigged on two masts. Most had a topsail above the huge mainsail {{and a large}} foresail. The mizzen was a much smaller mast on which was set a single sail whose main purpose was to aid steering when tacking. The rig also allowed a relatively large sail area on {{the upper part of}} the mast, to catch wind when moored ships, buildings or trees blocked wind on the water's surface. Sail areas varied from 3000-5000 sq ft (278.8-464.5 sq m) depending on the size of the barge. The typical, rusty-red colour of the flax sails was due to the dressing used to waterproof them (traditionally made from <b>red</b> ochre, <b>cod</b> oil, urine and seawater). These barges required no ballast. No auxiliary power was used originally but many barges were fitted with engines in later years.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} the EC Study Project 99 / 016 “Data collection for stock assessment of two hakes (Merluccius hubbsi and M. australis) in international and Falkland waters of the SW Atlantic”. Historical fishery and biological data series available from IEO (1988 onwards) were used to describe and quantify patterns and spatio-temporal changes in catches and discards in the hake fishery. Data were collected by scientific observers on board Spanish fishing vessels operating in the study area. Data collected on fishing activity included effort, catches and discards of target and non-target species on a haul-by-haul basis. Biological information (size, sex, maturity, etc) on target species was recorded on a daily basis, while biological data on non-target species was recorded periodically. The “discards ratio” was calculated by each haul, defined as the total weight of fish discarded divided by the total catch weight. The most important by-catch species are hoki or whiptailed hake (Macruronus magellanicus), <b>red</b> <b>cod</b> (Salilota australis), southern blue whiting (Micromesistius australis), Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) and kingclip (Genypterus blacodes). Discards included both target and non-target species. The most commonly discarded species were Patagonotothen spp. (almost 100 % of the catch is discarded), whiptailed hake (Macruronus magellanicus) (25 % discarded), southern blue whiting (12 %) and <b>red</b> <b>cod</b> (6 %). These percentages vary with area, year and fishing season. The four target species (Merluccius hubbsi, Merluccius australis, Illex argentinus and Loligo gahi) have discard ratios below 5 %. In recent years discard ratios for all species except Patagonotothen spp. have fallen below 15 %...|$|E
40|$|Codfishes, of {{the order}} Gadiformes (Anacanthini), puborder Gadoidei, are {{moderate}} to deep water fishes which have a worldwide distribution. The group is best represented in temperate and cold waters, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, where it contains {{some of the most}} valuable commercial species found anywhere in the world. Predominantly bottom-dwelling omnivores, these fishes characteristically have moderately elongate bodies covered with small scales, a tail fin free from dorsal and anal fins, a dorsal fin divided into two, or three parts, pelvic fins jugular in position, all fins being without true spines. The mouth is large and terminal, the chin often has a sensory barbel. In New Zealand waters, codfishes are represented by six families, twelve genera, and fifteen species. Many of these are little known deep water species. Unexploited and seldom seen by New Zealand fishermen, their occurrence in our waters in any quantity has only recently become known through the reports of foreign fishing fleets. The best known of New Zealand's codfishes is the <b>red</b> <b>cod</b> Pseudophycis bacchus (Forster in Bloch and Schneider, 1801). Of all the cods, this species most closely resembles its northern hemisphere counterparts. Elongate with a stout body, it is distinguished from other southern species by its red-grey colour, square-cut tail, body proportions, the number of rays in its fins (first dorsal 9 - 12, second dorsal 39 - 48, anal 40 - 50, caudal 32 - 36, pectorals 22 - 26, pelvics 5 - 6), and by a black spot {{on the side of the}} body near the pectoral fins. Averaging 2 kg (to 6. 3 kg) in weight and 55 cm (to 120 cm) in length, the <b>red</b> <b>cod</b> is an active wandering marine fish with a range which extends from the shore into depths of over 750 metres (Shuntov, pers. comm.). Fast growing and of relatively short lifespan, this primarily ground-dwelling predator moves throughout the levels of the sea at times, feeding on a wide range of marine animals...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{quantify}} the trophic relationships of seven commercially valuable predatory fish species (Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi, southern hake Merluccius australis, Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides, southern blue whiting Micromesistius australis australis, <b>red</b> <b>cod</b> Salilota australis, kingclip Genypterus blacodes and hoki Macruronus magellanicus) over a two-year period. A total of 1590 stomachs from these species was collected from the high seas of the southwest Atlantic and in the waters around the Falkland Islands. The percentage similarity index shows that all species except southern hake occupy very similar trophic positions, with a high percentage dietary overlap. Despite this, niche breadths were relatively narrow, {{with the majority of}} feeding occurring on locally abundant prey items (notothiniid fish and the squids Illex argentinus and Loligo gahi). In the two species for which sample size was largest, Argentine hake and kingclip, geographical differences in diet were found, which may be related to regional variation in prey abundance. The results are discussed in relation to the seasonal migrations of predators and prey and the hydroclimate regime...|$|E

40|$|The Australian {{fur seal}} Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus is a {{temperate}} latitude species with a breeding distribution restricted to Bass Strait, Australia. Recent {{studies of the}} foraging behaviour of female Australian fur seals indicated that they feed demersally in the shallow continental shelf waters, a behaviour that {{is in contrast to}} the epipelagic foraging of females of most other arctocephaline (Southern Hemisphere fur seals) species and akin to that observed in sea lions. These studies, however, were conducted at one colony (Kanowna Island) located in central northern Bass Strait, and it was suggested that the observed foraging behaviour may have been due to the distance of this colony from the continental shelf edge (180 km), making it inefficient to forage beyond it. Here, the diet of lactating Australian fur seals was compared between 2 colonies to test if differing proximity to the continental shelf edge resulted in differences in foraging behaviour. The 2 breeding colonies studied, Kanowna Island and The Skerries, were 180 and 25 km from the nearest shelf edge, respectively. We analysed a total of 917 scat samples collected at the 2 colonies between 1997 and 2001. From faecal analysis, 45 primarily demersal on-shelf species of fishes and cephalopods were identified. Only 4 species had a frequency of occurrence greater than 10 %: redbait Emmelichthys nitidus, jack mackerel Trachurus sp., <b>red</b> rock <b>cod</b> Pseudophycis bachus, and Gould’s squid Nototodarus gouldi.
