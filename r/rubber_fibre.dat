40|$|Conductive {{electrodes}} {{and electric}} circuits that can remain active and electrically stable under large mechanical deformations are highly desirable for {{applications such as}} flexible displays(1 - 3), field-effect transistors(4, 5), energy-related devices(6, 7), smart clothing(8) and actuators(9 - 11). However, high conductivity and stretchability seem to be mutually exclusive parameters. The most promising {{solution to this problem}} has been to use one-dimensional nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes and metal nanowires coated on a stretchable fabric(12, 13), metal stripes with a wavy geometry(14, 15), composite elastomers embedding conductive fillers(16, 17) and interpenetrating networks of a liquid metal and rubber(18). At present, the conductivity values at large strains remain too low to satisfy requirements for practical applications. Moreover, the ability to make arbitrary patterns over large areas is also desirable. Here, we introduce a conductive composite mat of silver nanoparticles and <b>rubber</b> <b>fibres</b> that allows the formation of highly stretchable circuits through a fabrication process that is compatible with any substrate and scalable for large-area applications. A silver nanoparticle precursor is absorbed in electrospun poly (styrene-block-butadiene-block-styrene) (SBS) <b>rubber</b> <b>fibres</b> and then converted into silver nanoparticles directly in the fibre mat. Percolation of the silver nanoparticles inside the fibres leads to a high bulk conductivity, which is preserved at large deformations (sigma approximate to 2, 200 S cm(- 1) at 100 % strain for a 150 -mm-thick mat). We design electric circuits directly on the electrospun fibre mat by nozzle printing, inkjet printing and spray printing of the precursor solution and fabricate a highly stretchable antenna, a strain sensor and a highly stretchable light-emitting diode as examples of applications. close 453...|$|R

This paper presents the fresh-state behavior of self compacting concrete (SCC) containing waste material fibres. Fibres were recycling product of wastes material such as, plastic bottle, rubber tire and alloy cans. Thirteen mixtures with 0. 47 of water cement ratio of SCCs were added micro size (fine tire fibre) and macro (coarse tire fibre) size of <b>rubber</b> <b>fibre,</b> alloy can fibre and plastic bottle fibre with 0, 5 %, 0, 1 % and 1, 5 % of vol. fibre dosage respectively. The macro size fibres were about 35 of fibre aspect ratio (length/diameter). One other sample was SCC without fibre as reference. The measured of concrete fresh behavior was concrete flow and passing-ability by slump flow, J-Ring, L-box, U-box and V-funnel tests. The results showed that the concrete fresh state performance decreases generally due to the increase of waste material fibre dosage and stiffer waste material fibres in SCC. The fine tire fibre recorded the best fresh state performances among SCC containing fibres and did not show much different performance compared to the SCC without fibre...|$|E
40|$|Adhesion is a difficult, but {{important}} phenomenon which {{needs to be}} addressed in the field of pavement engineering. A strong adhesion between the constituents of pavement and between the layers of the pavement is an indication of its durability. Many modern materials like <b>rubber,</b> <b>fibre,</b> epoxy binder, adhesion promoter etc., are used as a replacement or addition to the conventional bitumen and aggregate materials in pavement construction. The introduction of these materials thus require a better understanding of their adhesive properties, which influences to a great extent, the pavement performance. Since there are no standard tests available to quantify adhesion in pavement engineering, the study aims at developing a framework of easily implementable test procedure {{that can be used for}} the assessment of the adhesive bond between the different materials used in pavement construction. This was achieved by performing direct tension test on different types of aggregate-binder systems. As the presence of moisture is a known factor that affects adhesion, in turn affecting performance of the pavement, the study also concentrated towards this aspect. Three types of aggregates (porphyry, diorite and sandstone), in combination with four different binders (bitumen pen 70 / 100, SBS polymer modified bitumen, polyurethane based binder and epoxy based binder) and two adhesion promoters (Type a and b, with variation in curing time) were tested in this study. They were subjected to low and high temperature and strain rates and the effect of moisture on these materials were also investigated. It was found from this study that the direct tension test was easily implementable, which could help the contractors and researchers in quantifying the adhesion between the various aggregate-binder systems.

40|$|The {{performance}} of fibre-reinforced composites is strongly {{dependent on the}} nature and the strength of the fibre–matrix interface.

40|$|From the {{chemical}} point of view, polymers comprise long molecules {{in which the}} same basic unit is replaced many times. Polyvinyl chloride, P. V. C., a typical polymer consists of vinyl chloride units linked together. Polymers occur widely in nature. In the inorganic world, rocks, clays and sands are all polymers based on units containing silicon and oxygen. In the organic realm, the structural materials of living organisms are polymers: cellulose in plants and proteins in animals. The products of metabolism {{of plants and animals}} may also be polymeric. One important example is natural rubber - a long chain of isoprene units. In physical properties most polymers fall into one of the three classes - plastics, <b>rubbers</b> and <b>fibres.</b> Some polymeric materials can be stretched to many times their initial length, yet on releasing return to their original dimensions. These are called rubbers. Plastics cannot be reversibly deformed in this manner, and are often hard and glassy. Nylon and other high polymers are characterised by marked readiness to form fibres strong along their length but often weak laterally. Such man-made fibres can be spun woven or knitted into fabrics.

50|$|In {{the last}} century, {{polymers}} became a base material {{in everyday life}} for products like plastics, <b>rubbers,</b> films, <b>fibres</b> or paints. This huge demand has forced to extend their reliability and maximum lifetime, and a new design class of polymeric materials {{that are able to}} restore their functionality after damage or fatigue was envisaged. These polymer materials can be divided into two different groups based on the approach to the self-healing mechanism: intrinsic or extrinsic.Autonomous self-healing polymers follow a three-step process very similar to that of a biological response. In the event of damage, the first response is triggering or actuation, which happens almost immediately after damage is sustained. The second response is transport of materials to the effected area, which also happens very quickly. The third response is the chemical repair process. This process differs {{depending on the type of}} healing mechanism that is in place (e.g., polymerization, entanglement, reversible cross-linking). These self-healing materials can be classified in three different ways: capsule based, vascular, and intrinsic. While similar in some ways, these three ways differ in the ways that response is hidden or prevented until actual damage is sustained.|$|R
