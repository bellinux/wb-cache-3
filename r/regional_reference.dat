5|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1999 for the City of Portland by researchers from Portland State University found that Johnson Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates, {{an important source}} of food for fish and other aquatic life. The study compared differences in these life forms and in water chemistry from two urban streams, Johnson Creek and Tryon Creek in southwest Portland, with two nearby rural streams and found that benthic communities in the urban streams were degraded compared to the <b>regional</b> <b>reference</b> creeks.|$|E

50|$|ITV1 {{became the}} generic {{on-screen}} brand name {{used by the}} twelve franchises of the ITV Network in the United Kingdom.

50|$|In {{the times}} {{following}} the Ottoman conquest, the name «Bošnjanin» {{was transformed into}} «Bošnjak» (Bosh-nyak, Bosniak in English). During early Ottoman rule, the term «Bošnjak» was applied exclusively to the Christian population, while islamized natives were referred to as «Bosnalu». However, in following centuries (16th to 19th), this name, under various hyphenated forms («Bošnjak-milleti», «Bošnjak-taifesi») had acquired additional nuances of meaning: it became the common term for all the inhabitants of Bosnian Turkish pashaluk/military province. However, it is just one <b>regional</b> <b>reference.</b> The bureaucracy of the theocratic Ottoman Empire couldn't even imagine that Muslims and Christians {{in one of the}} provinces of the vast Islamic polity would constitute a separated, supradenominational community.

These were {{based in the}} natural regions identified by the geographer Amorim Girão in several studies he published between 1922 and 1930.

This organizational structure for the territory resulted in a loss of the sense of regional identity, which was only kept alive by oral traditions, based on <b>regional</b> <b>references</b> of origin.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{ionosphere}} {{affects the}} electromagnetic waves that pass through it by inducing an additional transmission time delay. The ionosphere influence {{has now become}} the largest error source in GPS positioning and navigation after the turn-off of the Selective Availability (SA). In this paper, methods of 2 D gridbased and 3 D tomography-based ionospheric modeling are developed based on <b>regional</b> GPS <b>reference</b> networks. Performance analysis was conducted using data from two different <b>regional</b> GPS <b>reference</b> networks. The modeling accuracy of the vertical TEC (VTEC) is {{at the level of}} several TECU for 2 D ionospheric modeling and about one TECU for 3 D tomographic modeling after a comparison to independent ionospheric map data or directly measured ionospsheric TEC values. The data analysis has indicated that the modeling accuracy based on the 3 D tomography method is much higher than the 2 D grid-based approach...|$|R
5000|$|Studies {{of public}} library {{services}} in California {{had shown that}} {{large parts of the}} state, particularly rural areas, were underserved. In response, a 1962 master plan called for the establishment of four levels of library services: local libraries, <b>regional</b> <b>reference</b> centers, tertiary reference centers covering larger regions, and as the fourth and final level, the State Library in Sacramento. The Bay Area Reference Center was established in August 1967 as a tertiary center, or [...] "source of last resort", as a collaboration between the San Francisco Public Library and the North Bay Cooperative Library System (NBCLS), a consortium of nine public library systems including 17 libraries in six counties north of San Francisco, with its headquarters in Santa Rosa. It was made possible by a federal grant under the 1964 Library Services and Construction Act; the initial grant was $750,735 for a two-year pilot project. A corresponding service was set up for Southern California, the Southern California Answering Network (SCAN).|$|E
