40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is concerned with developing {{a greater understanding of}} piston ring lubrication and consists of both experimental and theoretical components. It begins with a review of piston ring and ring pack lubrication studies, describing how the understanding of the operation of piston rings has progressed since the late 19 th Century. A well-established method of analysing the hydrodynamic lubrication of a single piston ring, utilizing coordinate data to describe the ring face profile, is then presented. Calculation of mixed/boundary friction, when the lubricant film thickness falls below a pre-determined level, is included. The predictions of this program are then compared to results obtained by other workers to validate its operation. This analysis is then developed to investigate the influence of the circumferential variation in piston ring face profile on the lateral motion of the piston <b>ring</b> <b>centre.</b> The complex relationship between variation in ring face profile, angular ring gap position and bore shape is then examined. These features are shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the calculation of <b>ring</b> <b>centre</b> locus, oil transport and lubricant film thicknesses. The model is then applied to predict the influence of the distorted bore shape of a cylinder from an experimental engine apparatus. Following this, the development, testing, calibration and performance of a capacitance based measurement system capable of recording piston ring face profiles on a single pass, is described. This system was used with twenty-one transducers, of novel design, to allow the axial and circumferential distribution of lubricant film thickness to be monitored on an engine liner. This liner was fitted in an engine apparatus which had the additional facility of being able to measure the instantaneous friction between the piston assembly and cylinder liner using a "floating liner" technique. Experimental measurements of instantaneous friction force and the circumferential distribution of lubricant film thickness are then compared to theoretical predictions for a range of operating conditions. The comparisons reveal a reasonable level of agreement between measurements with consistent overall trends. The effect of varying bore distortion is also examined theoretically. It is shown that an increase in the severity of bore distortion does not necessarily result in an increase in net oil transport...|$|E

40|$|The Bog Ecosystem Research Initiative (BERI) {{project was}} {{initiated}} to investigate, at five climatically different sites across Europe, {{the effects of}} elevated CO 2 and N deposition on the net exchange of CO 2 and CH 4 between bogs and the atmosphere, and to {{study the effects of}} elevated CO 2 and N deposition on the plant biodiversity of bog communities. A major challenge to investigate the effects of elevated CO 2 on vegetation and ecosystems is to apply elevated CO 2 concentrations to growing vegetation without changing the physical conditions like climate and radiation. Most available CO 2 enrichment methods disturb the natural conditions to some degree, for instance closed chambers or open top chambers. Free Air CO 2 Enrichment (FACE) systems have proven to be suitable to expose plants to elevated CO 2 concentrations with minimal disturbance of their natural environment. The size and spatial scale of the vegetation studied within the BERI project allowed the use of a modified version of a small FACE system called MiniFACE. This paper describes the BERI MiniFACE design as well as its temporal and spatial performance at the five BERI field locations. The temporal performance of the MiniFACE system largely met the quality criteria defined by the FACE Protocol. One minute average CO 2 concentrations measured at the centre of the ring stayed within 20 ␘f the pre-set target for more than 95 ␘f the time. Increased wind speeds were found to improve the MiniFACE system's temporal performance. Spatial analyses showed no apparent CO 2 gradients across a ring during a 4 day period and the mean differences between each sampling point and the centre of the ring did not exceed 10 ÐObservations made during a windy day, causing a CO 2 concentration gradient, and observations made during a calm day indicated that short term gradients tend to average out over longer periods of time. On a day with unidirectional strong winds, CO 2 concentrations at the upwind side of the <b>ring</b> <b>centre</b> were higher than those made at the centre and at the downwind side of the <b>ring</b> <b>centre,</b> but the bell-shaped distribution was found basically the same for the centre and the four surrounding measurement points, implying that the short term (1 sec) variability of CO 2 concentrations across the MiniFACE ring is almost the same at any point in the ring. Based on gas dispersion simulations and measured CO 2 concentration profiles, the possible interference between CO 2 -enriched and control rings was found to be negligible beyond a centre-to-centre ring distance of 6 m...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of square molecules containing four redox-active metal centres and two positive charges {{which would be}} interesting as potential candidates for molecular Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) models constitutes {{the aim of this}} thesis. In this new paradigm, the binary information is encoded in the charge configuration of the QCA cell, {{and in the case of}} a molecular QCA, in the charge configuration of a single molecule. In order to synthesise such molecules with metal centres of general formula M(PP) Cp’ [M = Fe, Ru; PP = dppe, (PPh₃) ₂; Cp’ = Cp, Cp*], new synthetic methods have been developed. By chemically oxidising mono- or bi-metallic alkynyl complexes, radical coupling can occur, mainly depending on the nature of the metal (Fe or Ru) and the length of the carbon chain (C₂, C₄ or C₆), to give dimers with original geometry. Therefore, this thesis describes the oxidation studies of iron- and ruthenium-alkynyl complexes containing short (C₂) to long carbon chains (C₆), and the characterisations of the oxidised products. The reactivity of the mononuclear 17 -electron species [Ru(C≡CR) (PPh₃) ₂Cp]•+ (16, R = Ph; 19, R = Tol) and [Fe(C≡CC≡CR) (dppe) Cp*]•+ (2 a, R = Ph; 2 b R = Tol) was investigated, dimerisation occurring in both cases. Intermolecular radical coupling of 16 •+ afforded a linear dimer by coupling at the C[subscript]β and C[subscript]para positions, whereas dimerisation of 2 •+ gives a single dicationic complex [27][PF₆]₂ containing a squared C₄ <b>ring</b> <b>centre</b> and two Fe(dppe) Cp* units. The reactivity of the bimetallic 35 -electron species [{Cp’(dppe) M}(C≡CC≡CC≡C) {M(dppe) Cp’}]•+ (M = Fe, Ru; Cp’ = Cp, Cp*) was also investigated. The mixed-valence systems containing the M(dppe) Cp* (M = Fe, Ru) fragments were revealed to be stable and isolable: the first crystal structures of mixed-valence complexes with a carbon chain longer than C 4 were resolved for [{Cp*(dppe) Fe}₂(μ-C≡CC≡CC≡C) ]PF₆ [30]PF₆ and [{Cp*(dppe) Fe}(C≡CC≡CC≡C) {Ru(dppe) Cp*}]PF₆ [34]PF₆. Electronic delocalisation in these stable mixed-valence complexes, between the two metal centres and through the C₆ bridge, was revealed to be strong which was unexpected for the unsymmetrical system [34]PF₆. In contrast, the mixed-valence systems containing the Ru(dppe) Cp fragment were not stable at room temperature and dimerised to afford dicationic square-shaped tetrametallic complexes with a C₄ <b>ring</b> <b>centre.</b> Two unsymmetrical dimers were characterised: one containing four Ru(dppe) Cp centres [43][PF₆]₂ and the other containing two Ru(dppe) Cp and two Fe(dppe) Cp* fragments [44][PF₆]₂. Compound [43][PF₆]₂ has been fully characterised and the positive charge revealed to be fully delocalised over the whole molecule. Even if unsymmetrical, these molecules are interesting for being potential molecular QCA models. It has been shown that TCNQ acts as an oxidising agent for iron- and ruthenium-alkynyl complexes. The organometallic 17 -e species generated further react by coupling between the cationic and anionic radical [TCNQ]•- to give specifically TCNQ adducts. These new complexes which contain two electrophores possess unique properties. The σ-linked electron donor organometallic centre and the organic electron withdrawing group via an alkyndiyl bridge allow intramolecular charge transfer. The X-ray crystal structure analyses, electrochemistry and UV-Vis spectroscopy have been investigated and reveal the interesting properties of these molecules. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|During drowsy periods, {{performance}} on tasks requiring continuous attention becomes intermittent. Previously, we {{have reported that}} during drowsy periods of intermittent performance, 7 of 10 participants performing an auditory detection task exhibited episodes of non-responding lasting about 18 s (Makeig & Jung, 1996). Further, the time patterns of these episodes were repeated precisely in subsequent sessions. The 18 -s cycles were accompanied by counterbalanced power changes within two frequency bands in the vertex EEG (near 4 Hz and circa 40 Hz). In the present experiment, performance patterns and concurrent EEG spectra were examined in four participants performing a continuous visuomotor compensatory tracking task in 15 - 20 minute bouts during a 42 -hour sleep deprivation study. During periods of good performance, participants made compensatory trackball movements about twice per second, attempting to keep a target disk near a central ring. Autocorrelations of time series representing {{the distance of the}} target disk from the <b>ring</b> <b>centre</b> showed that during periods of poor performance marked near- 18 -s cycles in performance again appeared. There were phases of poor or absent performance accompanied by an increase in EEG power that was largest at 3 - 4 Hz. These studies show that in drowsy humans, opening and closing of the gates of behavioural awareness is marked not by the appearance of (12 - 14 Hz) sleep spindles, but by prominent EEG amplitude changes in the low theta band. Further, both EEG and behavioural changes during drowsiness often exhibit stereotyped 18 -s cycles...|$|E
