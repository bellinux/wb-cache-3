500|$|Often {{considered}} to be the first true canal in England, it required the construction of an aqueduct to cross the River Irwell, one of the first of its kind. [...] Its success helped inspire a period of intense canal building in Britain, known as Canal Mania. [...] It later faced intense competition from the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and the Macclesfield Canal. [...] Navigable throughout its history, {{it is one of the}} few canals in Britain not to have been nationalised, and remains privately owned.

40|$|We show in {{this paper}} how the ring {{topology}} makes easier the analysis of communicating finite state machines' reachability set. We prove that the analysis {{of this kind of}} systems can be reduced to the analysis of a single automaton with a single queue. This leads us, by the use of new symbolic transitions, to the proposal of two semi-algorithms, one for normal <b>ring</b> <b>networks</b> and one for lossy <b>ring</b> <b>networks.</b> In the case of normal <b>ring</b> <b>networks,</b> the proposed semi-algorithm is simpler and more general than those of [BGWW 97] and [BH 97]. In particular, the time complexity of its key steps is polynomial whereas those of [BGWW 97] and [BH 97] have not been investigated and should not be polynomial (the one of [BH 97] uses Pressburger arithmetic which induces a double exponential time complexity). The semi-algorithm for lossy <b>ring</b> <b>networks</b> is a simple application of this for normal <b>ring</b> <b>networks</b> and is however more general than that of [ABJ 98].
