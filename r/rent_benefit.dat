However, {{little is known about the}} extent of this phenomenon. How many households fail to claim money from the government to which they are entitled. The report looks among other things at non-take-up of housing benefit (now replaced by <b>rent</b> <b>benefit),</b> educational expenses allowances, exemption from local taxes, supplementary assistance and long-term minimum income allowance. It also explores who the members of these households are and what reasons lie behind their failure to claim the benefits to which they are entitled. The report also examines whether there is evidence of cumulative non-take-up: is there a 'hard core' of non-users, or are the non-users of the different benefits different groups of households in each case? The non-take-up rates were ascertained from national administrative databases plus a supplementary survey of potential claimants. The pros and cons of this method, which was used for the first time in the Netherlands in this study, are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Rent control {{provides}} substantial in-kind {{benefits to}} tenants of social housing. In the Netherlands these benefits equal almost 40 % {{of the market}} rent on average. We show that <b>rent</b> control <b>benefits</b> for the 10 % tenants with highest income are 5 % points higher than the benefits for the 10 % with lowest incomes. Next we provide evidence that rent control influences the housing tenure choice decision. We find that on average rent control reduces transitions within the social housing sector, but not transitions from the social housing sector. Only the 20 % tenants with highest incomes postpone moves out of social housing in response to rent control. This suggests that the inequitable distribution of <b>rent</b> control <b>benefits</b> is prolonged by the reduction in transition rates out of social housing.

40|$|A simple {{model is}} used to {{illustrate}} {{the effects of a}} reduction in (marginal) abatement cost in a two country setting. It can be shown that a the country experiencing a cost reduction can actually be worse off. This holds true for a variety of quantity and price based emission policies. The most important channel is that a country with lower abatement costs engages in additional abatement effort for which it is not compensated. Under a quantity based policy with a given allocation, a seller of permits can also be negatively affected from a lower carbon price. We also argue that abatement cost shocks to renewable energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS) are different in terms of their effects on international energy markets. A shock to renewable energy reduces fossil fuel <b>rents</b> <b>benefiting</b> energy importers, while the opposite holds for a shock to CCS. The channels obtained in the theoretical model can be confirmed in a more complex global computable general equilibrium model.

Many poor and low-income households are benefited but the distributional effects are minimal since nonpoor families have equal access to rent-controlled units. Evidence of losses or income transfers from landlords to tenants is not substantiated. The most probable income transfers are those from short-stayers to long-stayers. Rent control is a poor mechanism for income transfer. However, the rental housing market tend to be monopolistic and rent control maybe necessary to prevent economic eviction and abuses on payment of key monies. In this case, government has to provide better monitoring mechanism and ensure enforcement of lease contracts. rent control, rental housing market...|$|R

5000|$|According {{to other}} sources, the word farm comes from Middle English ferme ("farm, rent, revenue; revenue {{collected}} from a farmer; factor, stewardship, meal, feast"), from Old English feorm, farm ("provision, stores of food, supplies, possessions; provisions supplied {{to the king}} or a lord by a tenant or vassal; <b>rent,</b> feast, <b>benefit,</b> assylum"), from Proto-Germanic *firmō, *firχumō ("means of living, subsistence"), from Proto-Indo-European *perkwu- ("life, strength, force"). It is related to other Old English words such as feormehām ("farm"), feormere ("purveyor, grocer"), feormian ("to provision, sustain"), and feorh ("life, spirit"). The Old English word is stated by these sources as having unusually been borrowed by Medieval Latin as firma or ferma and to have provided the Old French ferme [...] "farm", Occitan ferma [...] "farm". This is refuted by those sources which state firma to derive from classical Latin firmus. The word continued the same senses of [...] "rent, farmed office, source of revenue, feast". The meaning [...] "rent, fixed payment", which was already present in the Old English word, was further strengthened due to the word's resemblance to the unrelated (so say these sources) Latin firmus ("firm, solid"), and firmitas ("security, firmness").|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two parts. The first part considers social housing from a microeconomic perspective {{and looks at the}} self-selection into social housing, as well as at how this influences consumption patterns, household mobility within and from the social housing sector, and the wage rates workers earn. The second part is macroeconomic in nature and considers the joint effect of housing and labor market price rigidities on local skill composition. Also, it is investigated whether social housing influences the skill composition of the local labor force. Chapter three studies consumption patterns of homeowners and tenants in social housing: The last group spends less on housing and more on basic goods, recreation and alcohol and tobacco. Also, evidence for consumption differences between restricted and unrestricted tenants of social housing is found. Restricted tenants spend less on housing and more on recreation, although the size of the effect is limited. No evidence is found that the level of consumption is affected by house prices. Chapter four considers the effect of <b>rent</b> control <b>benefits</b> on moving within and from the social housing sector. Estimation results are based on a unique household panel dataset for the years 2006 through 2008 that has been constructed from administrative records provided by Statistics Netherlands. Results indicate that the effect of <b>rent</b> control <b>benefits</b> on household mobility is large for transitions within the social housing sector, whereas it is limited for transitions from the social housing sector. These results suggest that rent control has a limited effect on the demand for owner-occupied housing. Chapter five tests whether the wage rate is affected by housing tenure type using a large panel for the years 2006 through 2008 based on administrative records. The analysis reveils that conditioning on worker skill is very important: Without controlling for the sorting mechanism of low-skilled workers into social housing one would conclude that homeowners earn 25 percent higher wages compared to tenants of social housing. In contrast, if one controls for sorting according to skill, {{there is no evidence that}} homeowners or tenants living in social housing earn different wages compared to tenants of private housing. The model in chapter six shows that the effect of housing market and labor market price rigidities on local skill composition is skill-specific. In general, both housing market price rigidities and labor market price rigidities have an amplified effect on city composition after a shock to the productivity of high-skilled labor. However, rent control housing vouchers mitigate the effect of nominal wage rigidities if the productivity of low-skilled workers changes. About one third of the Dutch housing stock is rent-controlled. As these houses are mainly allocated to low-skilled workers, rent-controlled housing might reduce the share of high-skilled workers. Chapter seven finds evidence for such a negative relationship, although the size of the effect is modest. A ten percentage point increase of the rent-controlled housing stock is found, ceteris paribus, to reduce the percentage of high-skilled workers in a region with 1. 5 percentage points...|$|R
