40|$|We {{observed}} distinct interlayer {{shear mode}} Raman spectra for trilayer graphene with ABA and ABC stacking order. There are two rigid-plane shear-mode phonon branches in trilayer graphene. We found that ABA trilayers exhibit pronounced Raman <b>response</b> <b>from</b> the high-frequency shear branch, without any noticeable <b>response</b> <b>from</b> the low-frequency branch. In contrast, ABC trilayers exhibit no <b>response</b> <b>from</b> the high-frequency shear branch, but significant Raman <b>response</b> <b>from</b> the low-frequency branch. Such complementary behaviors of Raman shear modes {{can be explained}} by the distinct symmetry of the two trilayer allotropes. The strong stacking-order dependence was not found in the layer-breathing modes, and thus represents a unique characteristic of the shear modes...|$|R
