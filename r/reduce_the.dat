Apart from selecting the conventional level inverters, Multi level inverters has been {{chosen for the}} industrial drive applications as it <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> total harmonic distortion. The involvement of higher number of switches increases {{the complexity of the}} system, which leads to losses in switching, producing huge harmonics and in the end, it entirely <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> efficiency of the system. The cascaded multilevel inverter involves only fewer switches, where it <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> complexity of the system which in turn <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> harmonics and <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> complexity of the system and in total it <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> total harmonics distortion...|$|R
