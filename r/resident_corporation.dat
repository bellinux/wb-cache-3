50|$|Most states {{impose a}} tax on income of {{corporations}} having sufficient connection ("nexus") with the state. Such taxes apply to U.S. and foreign corporations, and {{are not subject to}} tax treaties. Such tax is generally based on business income of the corporation apportioned to the state plus nonbusiness income only of <b>resident</b> <b>corporations.</b> Most state corporate income taxes are imposed at a flat rate and have a minimum amount of tax. Business taxable income in most states is defined, at least in part, by reference to federal taxable income.|$|R
40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the current}} “state of the art” {{of the tax}} harmonization across the European Union, and the {{attention is focused on}} the three most important drivers of this evolution o the national taxation systems of the Member states. The first one is the Treaty and the fundamental freedoms enshrined in it. In particular, the author emphasises the importance of the freedom of establishment and the free movement of capitals as provisions adequate to prevent international double taxations or an overall unfair taxation in one state of the Union or in another. The second one is the contribute of the European Court of Justice which stretched to the very limits the interpretation of the fundamental rights in order to cover the possible loopholes of positive EU law on Direct taxation. In other words, where a specific competence of European Union to legislate on tax matters is missing, then the same result could be possibly obtained interpreting the mentioned above basic rules of the Treaty. The third one is formed by the few directives on Direct taxation which have been passed by the Council in the last decades and covering mainly the so called passive income (interests, royalties and dividends) considered as a sort of priority in the Union policy. The reason justifying this intervention {{can be found in the}} fact that these very income are the most influenced by the not complete harmonization of the Treaty and the ones which more than any others are feasible to be produced in a cross border context. While labour income, for instance, is generally produced by workers in the states where they also resides, with some remarkable exceptions, it is quite common for a company to have non resident shareholders, or to have a loan from a non <b>resident</b> <b>corporation</b> or bank. The author analyses the content of the most important directives pinpointing the aspects which are relevant also for the non European investors in any Member state and the possibility for permanent establishment as well to invoke the protection of EU Tax law...|$|E
40|$|Australia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and New Zealand {{have all}} {{recently}} adopted comprehensive {{restrictions on the}} deductibility of interest expense applicable {{in the context of}} foreign direct investment. Recently-enacted section 18. 2 of the Income Tax Act (the Act), which denies the deduction of interest expense that {{can be traced to the}} earning of certain forms of exempt income in the context of outbound direct investment, is consistent with these legislative developments only in the broad sense of its attempt to impose some form of deductibility restriction. The approach chosen by the Department of Finance differs in two important respects from that in these other countries. First, it appears to be based on an assumption that different types of deductibility restrictions are required in the context of outbound and inbound direct investment, with the thin capitalization rules in subsections 18 (4) to (6) applying in the latter context to limit the deduction of interest expense on debt held by significant shareholders. Second, tracing is used to link interest expense and foreign-source income in the context of outbound direct investment. The comprehensive thin capitalization regimes in Australia and New Zealand apply equally in the context of outbound and inbound direct investment, as well as equally to intra-group debt and the external debt of a multinational group. Interest expense in excess of a specified leverage ratio is denied deductibility, unless a <b>resident</b> <b>corporation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s ratio is consistent with a multiple of the consolidated ratio of the multinational group to which it belongs. The deductibility restrictions adopted in Denmark, Germany, and Italy follow this same broad pattern, but an interest-coverage ratio, characteristic of earnings-stripping legislation, is used to specify the permissible level of interest expense. This article argues that the legislative models adopted in these particular countries are a preferable form of interest deductibility restriction in a second-best world in which tax policymakers pursue the maximization of national welfare. Although the legislative outcome is a largely symmetrical application of a comprehensive thin capitalization or earnings-stripping restriction in the context of outbound and inbound direct investment, the policy case for deductibility restrictions is somewhat different in these two contexts. The competing legislative alternatives to an unrestricted interest expense deduction are also different. As a modified form of asset apportionment, a comprehensive thin capitalization regime allows tax policymakers to realize a necessary balance between the need for revenue maintenance and the encouragement of desirable outbound and inbound direct investment. As a form of gross-revenue apportionment, a comprehensive earnings-stripping approach can realize the same balance, but there are some differences in design features that may suggest a slight preference for a comprehensive thin capitalization regime. The authors conclude with the presentation of some empirical evidence of leverage ratios of Canadian corporations which tentatively suggest a baseline in specifying a safe-harbour ratio. They believe that the Department of Finance should take the opportunity provided by the report of the Advisory Panel on Canada 2 ̆ 7 s System of International Taxation to reconsider section 18. 2, as well as the thin capitalization rules in subsections 18 (4) to (6) ...|$|E

50|$|The top company {{tax rate}} is 30%, though through the {{dividend}} imputation system Australian residents only pay this company income tax once as shareholders {{of the company}} on the profits distributed as dividends by Australian-resident corporations. Double taxation relief on resident owners of <b>resident</b> <b>corporations</b> is common in other countries. When an Australian corporation pays corporate income tax, franking credits are generated and can then be applied to dividend payments at a maximum rate of 30 cents per dollar of dividend. Shareholders may then use these credits to offset their own personal income tax payable, including claiming a refund for excess franking credits left over after offsetting all payable income tax.|$|R
