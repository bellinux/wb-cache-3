The cylinder oscillation appears to trigger a distinctive shedding pattern which {{is related to the}} Reynolds number dependence of the drag reduction.

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{theoretical}} modeling of the rheological properties of the magnetic suspensions in shear flows under an external magnetic field aligned with the streamlines. The conventional theory postulates that the field-induced aggregates of magnetic particles are highly anisotropic and aligned with the flow direction.

However, experiments reveal a strong Bingham rheological behavior of the suspensions with a dynamic yield stress of the same order of magnitude that the one measured in the magnetic fields perpendicular to the flow. We explain the high level of shear stress, generated in longitudinal magnetic fields, by stochastic <b>rotary</b> <b>oscillations</b> of the aggregates caused by many-body magnetic interactions with neighboring aggregates.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of vortex methods employing smooth vortex particles/blobs is de-termined by the blob size, {{which can be}} viewed as a mollifier of the vorticity field. For computational efficiency, this core size needs to be spatially variable as particles are used to discretize different parts of the flow field, such as the boundary layer and the wake in bluff body flows. We derive here a consistent approximation for the viscous Navier–Stokes equations using variable size vortex particles. This derivation is based on the implementation of mappings that allow the consistent formulation of the diffusion and convection operators of the Navier–Stokes equations in the context of vortex methods. Several local mappings can be combined giving the capability of “mesh-embedding ” to vortex methods. It is shown that the proposed variable method offers a significant improvement on the computational efficiency of constant core size methods while maintaining the adaptive character of the method. The method is ideally suited to flows such as wakes and shear layers and the validity of the approach is illustrated by showing results from cylinder flows and wall-vortex interactions. Us-ing this scheme, previously unattainable simulations of cylinders undergoing <b>rotary</b> <b>oscillations</b> at high Reynolds numbers reveal an interesting mechanism for drastic drag reduction. c ° 2000 Academic Pres...|$|E

Exploratory experiments {{have been performed}} on circular cylinders executing forced rotary motions in a steady uniform flow. These motions include harmonic oscillations, steady rotation, and combinations of the two. Flow visualization and laser-Doppler velocimetry measurements were used to characterize the wake structure, and to estimate the convection speed, spacing, and strength of the vortical structures. Laser-Doppler velocimetry measurements were also made to estimate the cylinder drag coefficient and wake displacement thickness. In addition, the periodic flow close the cylinder and in the near wake region was mapped for a particular forced case.

40|$|Numerical {{results of}} fluid flow over a {{rotationally}} oscillating circular cylinder with splitter plate are presented here. Different {{from the previous}} examinations with freely rotatable assembly, the fluid and structure interactions are treated as a coupled dynamic system by fully considering the structural inertia, stiffness, and damping. The hydrodynamic characteristics are examined in terms of reduced velocity Ur at a relatively low Reynolds number Re = 100 for different plate lengths of L/D = 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5, where Ur = U/(Dfn), Re = UD/υ and fn = (κ/J) 0. 5 / 2 π with U the free stream velocity, D {{the diameter of the}} circular cylinder, υ the fluid kinematic viscosity, fn the natural frequency, J the inertial moment, κ the torsional stiffness, and L the plate length. Contrast to the freely rotating cylinder/plate body, that is, in the limit of κ → 0 or Ur →∞, remarkable <b>rotary</b> <b>oscillation</b> is observed at relatively low reduced velocities. For the typical case with L/D = 1. 0, the maximum amplitude may reach five times that at the highest reduced velocity of Ur = 15. 0 considered in this work. At the critical reduced velocity Ur = 4. 2, notable hydrodynamic jumps are identified for the rotation amplitude, response frequency, mean drag coefficient, lift amplitude, and vortex shedding frequency. Moreover, the phase angle between the fluid moment and <b>rotary</b> <b>oscillation</b> abruptly changes from 0 to π at Ur = 6. 5. Due to the combined effect of fluid moment, rotation response, and phase difference, the natural frequency of the rotating body varies in flow, leading to a wide regime of lock-in/synchronization (Ur ≥ 4. 2, for L/D = 1. 0). The phenomenon of rotation bifurcation, i. e., the equilibrium position of the <b>rotary</b> <b>oscillation</b> deflects to a position which is not parallel to the free stream, is found to only occur at higher reduced velocities. The longer splitter plate has the lower critical reduced velocity. The occurrence of bifurcation is attributed to the anti-symmetry breaking of the wake flow evolution. The resultant asymmetric mean pressure distribution on the splitter plate gives rise to the net lift force and the deviated moment on the assembly, leading to the offset mean position of splitter plate. The global vortex shedding is identified to be the classic 2 S mode for both cases with and without the bifurcation, although the second vortex formation and the shedding pattern in the near wake for the bifurcate case are different from the non-bifurcate case with lower reduced velocities...|$|R

40|$|Performed in {{this work}} is a {{comprehensive}} theoretical computer analysis of performances inherent to two types of multichannel optical rotary connectors (ORC) of compensation operation based on mirror and prismatic compensators. This analysis relies on exact analytical expressions obtained for light ray paths in ORC models with a mirror compensator made {{in the form of}} bilateral mirror placed between two optical hemispheres and with prismatic compensator made in the form of Dove prism placed between two non-aberrational elliptic lenses. Found in ORC with the mirror compensator is the essential deficiency inherent to all these constructions, which is related with considerable <b>rotary</b> <b>oscillations</b> in the value of optical signals in mirror angular positions when the mirror halves the input light beam. In these mirror positions, the amplitude value of optical signal oscillations exceeds 95 %, and optical losses are higher than – 13 dB, when the rotor turns. One deficiency more in these constructions is also strict technical requirements to the accuracy of making the optical components and mechanisms at the level of 1 … 2 µm. Concerning the ORC construction with a prismatic compensator as well as collimator and focusing lenses common for all the channels, one should note the inadmissibly high optical losses of the signal value (higher than – 30 … 40 dB) in the case of construction with fiber-optic interfaces, and large dimensions and mass in the case of active construction with optoelectronic transducers at the inputs and outputs of ORC. For example, when the number of channels N = 10 the longitudinal dimension of optical transfer channel (prism and lenses) exceeds 300 mm, and this dimension increases with increasing the number of channels. When this dimension is lower than 100 mm, the facility can be equipped with only one optical communication channel containing one LED and one photodiode located on the rotation axis. Optical losses in these constructions cannot be also considered as the satisfactory ones, since the respective loss value is higher than – 18 dB for the number of channels N = 10...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{takes a look}} at {{the near}} {{boundary}} flow about fish-like swimming bodies. Experiments were performed up to Reynolds number 106 using laser Doppler velocimetry and particle imaging techniques. The turbulence in the boundary layer of a waving mat and swimming robotic fish were investigated. How the undulating motion of the boundary controls both the turbulence production and the boundary layer development is of great interest. Unsteady motions have been shown effective in controlling flow. Tokumaru and Dimotakis (1991) demonstrated the control of vortex shedding, and thus the drag on a bluff body, through <b>rotary</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the body at certain frequencies. Similar results of flow control have been seen in fish-like swimming motions. Taneda and Tomonari (1974) illustrated that, for phase speeds greater than free stream velocity, traveling wave motion of a boundary tends to retard separation and reduce near-wall turbulence. In order to perform experiments on a two-dimensional waving plate, an apparatus was designed to be used in the MIT Propeller tunnel, a recirculating water tunnel. It is an eight-link piston driven mechanism that is attached to a neoprene mat in order to create a traveling wave motion down the mat. A correlation between this problem and that of a swimming fish is addressed herein, using visualization results obtained from a study of the MIT RoboTuna. The study of the MIT RoboTuna and a two-dimensional representation of the backbone of the robotic swimming fish was performed to further asses the implications of such motion on drag reduction. PIV experiments with the MIT RoboTuna indicate a laminarisation of the near boundary flow for swimming cases compared with non-swimming cases along the robot body. Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and PIV experiments were performed. (cont.) LDV results show the reduction of turbulence intensity, near the waving boundary, for increasing phase speed up to 1. 2 m/s after which the intensities begin to increase again through Cp = 2. 0 where numerical simulations by Zhang (2000) showed separation reappearing on the back of the crests. Velocity profiles who an acceleration of the fluid beyond the inflow speed at the crest region increases with increased phase speed and no separation was present in the trough for the moving wall.

Currents on the shelf showed extensive coherence inter alia and with meteorological variables, especially at low frequencies, for which therre was coherence with alongshelf wind, coastal shelf-break bottom pressure. These pressure variables were also extensively correlated with north/northeastward phase propagation and coherent with alongshelf wind at low frequencies. Currents over the slope in 500 m were principally aligned along the slope but less coherent with each other. In 1000 m or more there was still less coherence, and rotary motion suggested eddies in the Faeroe-Shetland Channel. Bottom pressure transferred from ocean to shelf-edge at higher frequencies and from shelf-edge to coast, allowing for correlated winds. Additional coastal variance prevents inference of oceanic bottom pressure therefrom. 'Mean' currents were (statistically) stronger to the north/northeast about 3 days after neap tides, by an amount (2 cm/s) not clearly related to mean flow strength...|$|R
40|$|Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) {{nanoparticles}} are {{objects of}} intense research activities {{due to their}} broad range of applications covering technological, medical, and environmental applications. They are used e. g. for <b>rotary</b> shaft sealing, <b>oscillation</b> damping, position sensing, magnetic inks for jet printing, as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging, and to remove heavy metals from wastewater. In addition, magnetite is a half-metal with a predicted negative spin polarisation making magnetite interesting for spintronics. For all applications, a high quality of magnetite is crucial to obtain the desired properties. In this work, we studied {{the influence of the}} surface on the electronic and magnetic properties of magnetite nanoparticles by means of x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and its associated magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). In particular, we investigated ensembles of magnetite nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 3 nm, 6 nm or 9 nm and the influence of capping the particles with a 3 nm thick silica shell or organic ligands. XANES and XMCD gives the unique possibility to distinguish between the three different Fe species in magnetite, i. e. tetrahedrally coordinated Fe 3 + ions, octahedrally coordinated Fe 3 +, and octahedrally coordinated Fe 2 +, by using different photon energies for hysteresis measurements. Besides changes in the electronic structure, i. e. in the density of unoccupied 3 d states monitored by XANES, and the effective spin magnetic moments, we obtained a different spin canting behaviour of Fe ions in magnetite at different lattice sites from the magnetic field dependent XMCD as shown in the figure below. The results are discussed regarding different exchange mechanisms and possible advantages and drawbacks for applications. Measurements were performed at beamline UE 46 -PGM 1, HZB – BESSY II synchrotron radiation facility. We thank the BESSY II staff for kind support during beamtimes.
