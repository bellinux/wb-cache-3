30|$|As {{well as the}} {{structural}} performance, the production efficiency should be carefully considered to develop the wooden guardrail system.

On the basis of section properties, the round shape has a two- to larger bending load capacity than rectangular shape that could be sawn from log [8]. Additionally, round timbers are not susceptible to the strength-reducing effects of grain angle and knots due to the section geometry and the tree physiology [9 – 13].|$|R
