40|$|This is {{the first}} {{national}} report on the epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>stillbirth</b> in Australia. Summary Australia {{is considered to be}} one of the safest countries in which to give birth. Viewed against comparable statistics worldwide, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirth</b> in Australia is among the lowest in the world. Yet 1 baby for every 135 born in this country is a <b>stillbirth.</b> The definition <b>of</b> a 2 ̆ 7 stillbirth 2 ̆ 7 varies internationally. A 2 ̆ 7 stillbirth 2 ̆ 7 in Australia is defined as the birth of a baby who shows no signs of life, after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 g or more. This first Australian report <b>of</b> <b>stillbirths</b> examines the association of maternal, pregnancy and birth factors with stillbirth. The report makes use of the extensive data about pregnancy and birth that have been collected in all states and territories since 1991. For the period 1991 - 2009, the stillbirth rate ranged from 6. 4 - 7. 8 per 1, 000 births, with no discernable trend. In 2009, the stillbirth rate was 7. 8 per 1, 000 births. In contrast, over these years there has been a continuing slow decline in neonatal mortality from 3. 8 - 2. 8 per 1, 000 live births. However, there have been changes over time in the <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rate</b> within subgroups <b>of</b> women with different characteristics. Between 1991 and 2009, the stillbirth rates in mothers aged 40 or older fell from 12. 7 to 10. 6 per 1, 000 births, but rose in teenage mothers from 9. 5 to 15. 0 per 1, 000 births. The increasing <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirth</b> among younger women warrants further investigation. Among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers, stillbirth rates fell from 15. 5 per 1, 000 total births in 1991 - 94 to 12. 3 per 1, 000 total births in 2005 - 09, while stillbirth rates among babies born to non-Indigenous mothers rose from 6. 6 to 7. 2 per 1, 000 total births. Similarly falling <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirth</b> over time among babies with higher birthweights were offset by increasing rates among babies with low birthweight; falling <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirth</b> among twins were offset by increasing rates among singletons and higher order multiple births.

The quarterly <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirths</b> were studied for the period 1928 - 78; and of deaths under the age of one year, in six different age groups, for the period 1912 - 78. A disappearance of seasonal {{variation in}} rates ('deseasonality') occurrred from stillbirths in about 1950, and for neonatal deaths in about 1965.

Retrospective population based cohort study of all singleton births at 24 or more weeks gestational age from 2000 - 2011 in Victoria, Australia. Stillbirths due to termination of pregnancy, babies with congenital anomalies and Indigenous mothers were excluded. Main Outcome Measure: Stillbirth. Over the 12 -year period there were 685, 869 singleton births and 2299 stillbirths, giving an overall <b>stillbirth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 3 · 4 per 1000 births. After adjustment for risk factors, compared to women born in Australia/New Zealand, women born in South Asia (aOR 1. 27, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 53, p = 0. 01), {{were more likely to have}} a stillbirth whereas women born in South East and East Asia were (aOR 0. 60, (95 % CI 0. 49 - 0. 72, p< 0. 001) less likely to have a stillbirth.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses of {{randomized}} controlled trials suggest that elective induction of labour at 41 weeks' gestation, compared with expectant management with selective labour induction, {{is associated with}} fewer perinatal deaths and no increase in the cesarean section rate. The authors studied the changes over time in the rates of labour induction in post-term pregnancies in Canada and examined the effects on the rates of stillbirth and cesarean section. METHODS: Changes {{in the proportion of}} total births at 41 weeks' and at 42 or more weeks' gestation, and in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirths</b> at 41 or more weeks' (versus 40 weeks') gestation in Canada between 1980 and 1995 were determined using data from Statistics Canada. Changes in the rates of labour induction and cesarean section were determined using data from hospital and provincial sources. RESULTS: There was a marked increase in the proportion of births at 41 weeks' gestation (from 11. 9 % in 1980 to 16. 3 % in 1995) and a marked decrease in the proportion at 42 or more weeks (from 7. 1 % in 1980 to 2. 9 % in 1995). The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirths</b> among deliveries at 41 or more weeks' gestation decreased significantly, from 2. 8 per 1000 total births in 1980 to 0. 9 per 1000 total births in 1995 (p < 0. 001). The stillbirth rate also decreased significantly among births at 40 weeks' gestation, from 1. 8 per 1000 total births in 1980 to 1. 1 per 1000 total births in 1995 (p < 0. 001). The magnitude of the decrease in the stillbirth rate at 41 or more weeks' gestation was greater than that at 40 weeks' gestation (p < 0. 001). All hospital and provincial sources of data indicated that the rate of labour induction increased significantly between 1980 and 1995 among women delivering at 41 or more weeks' gestation. The associated changes in rates of cesarean section were variable. INTERPRETATION: Between 1980 and 1995 clinical practice for the management of post-term pregnancy changed in Canada.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of safe obstetric practice in reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission and adverse perinatal outcomes, {{little is known about}} access to intrapartum obstetric care for HIV positive women. A cohort of HIV positive women were followed to assess the rate of intrapartum transfers and associated adverse outcomes in Addis Ababa. Overall, 282 HIV positive pregnant women were followed, 75 % gave birth at Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care facilities, 42 % of them transferred between health facilities during the intrapartum period and 36 % were transferred two or more times. Sixty four percent of the first time transfers were due to obstetric complications, while all subsequent transfers were due to practical constraints.

Methods and Findings: We performed a population-based cohort study using Danish national registry data linking various registers. The cohort included primiparous women with a live birth between January 1, 1982, and December 31, 2010 (n = 832, 996), with follow-up until the next event (stillbirth, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy) or censoring by live birth, death, emigration, or study end. Cox regression models {{for all types of}} cesarean sections, sub-group analyses by type of cesarean, and competing risks analyses for the causes <b>of</b> <b>stillbirth</b> were performed. An increased <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirth</b> (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 14, 95 % CI 1. 01, 1. 28) was found in women with primary cesarean section compared to spontaneous vaginal delivery, giving a theoretical absolute risk increase (ARI) of 0. 03 % for stillbirth, and a number needed to harm (NNH) of 3, 333 women.

40|$|Background and Aims: Caesarean section {{rates have}} {{increased}} in recent decades and the effects on subsequent pregnancy outcome are largely unknown. Prior research has hypothesised that Caesarean section delivery may lead to an increased risk <b>of</b> subsequent <b>stillbirth,</b> miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy and sub-fertility. Structure and Methods: Papers 1 - 3 are systematic reviews with meta-analyses. Papers 4 - 6 are findings from this thesis on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> subsequent <b>stillbirth,</b> miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy and live birth by mode of delivery. Results Systematic reviews and meta-analyses: A 23 % increased odds of subsequent stillbirth; no increase in odds of subsequent ectopic pregnancy and a 10 % reduction in the odds of subsequent live birth among women with a previous Caesarean section {{were found in the}} various meta-analyses. Danish cohorts: Results from the Danish Civil Registration System (CRS) cohort revealed a small increased <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> subsequent <b>stillbirth</b> and ectopic pregnancy among women with a primary Caesarean section, which remained in the analyses by type of Caesarean. No increased <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> miscarriage was found among women with a primary Caesarean section. In the CRS data, women with a primary Caesarean section had a significantly reduced <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> subsequent live birth particularly among women with primary elective and maternal-requested Caesarean sections. In the Aarhus Birth Cohort, overall the effect of mode of delivery on the rate and time to next live birth was minimal. Conclusions: Primary Caesarean section was associated with a small increased <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirth</b> and ectopic pregnancy, which may be in part due to underlying medical conditions. No increased <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> miscarriage was found. A reduced <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> subsequent live birth was found among Caesarean section in the CRS data. In the smaller ABC cohort, a small reduction in <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> subsequent live birth was found among women with a primary Caesarean section and is most likely due to maternal choice rather than any ill effects of the Caesarean.

40|$|Background: In {{high income}} {{countries}} {{there has been}} little improvement in stillbirth rates over the past two decades. Previous studies have indicated an ethnic disparity in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirths.</b> This study aimed to determine whether maternal ethnicity is independently associated with late stillbirth in New Zealand. Methods: Cases were women with a singleton, late stillbirth (≥ 28 weeks ’ gestation) without congenital abnormality, born between July 2006 and June 2009 in Auckland, New Zealand. Two controls with ongoing pregnancies were randomly selected at the same gestation at which the stillbirth occurred. Women were interviewed in the first few weeks following stillbirth, or at the equivalent gestation for controls. Detailed demographic data were recorded. The study was powered to detect an odds ratio of 2, with a power of 80 % at the 5 % level of significance, given a prevalence of the risk factor of 20 %. A multivariable regression model was developed which adjusted for known risk factors for stillbirth, as well as significant risk factors identified in the current study, and adjusted odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. Results: 155 / 215 (72 %) cases and 310 / 429 (72 %) controls consented. Pacific ethnicity, overweight and obesity, grandmultiparity, not being married, not being in paid work, social deprivation, exposure to tobacco smoke and use of recreational drugs were associated with an increased risk of late stillbirth in univariable analysis.

Methods and results: A prospective {{study was conducted in}} 33 centers in Italy between 1999 and 2003, mainly recording preterm delivery, stillbirths, neonatal mortality, congenital malformations and birthweight. Of the 668 women examined, 504 had type 1 diabetes and 164 had type 2. Pre-pregnancy counseling had been provided to 43. 9 % of the women who had type 1 diabetes and 29. 1 % of the women who had type 2 diabetes and correlated with a better HbA 1 c value throughout pregnancy. The preterm delivery rate was significantly higher in type 1 and 2 diabetics than in normal pregnant women and was related to HbA 1 c values higher than 8 %, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia and the presence of retinopathy before pregnancy. The stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates were also higher in diabetic pregnant women (1. 26 % and 0. 63 %, respectively) than in Italian pregnancies in general (0. 30 % and 0. 32 %), and the same was true for major congenital malformations (4. 9 % for diabetic pregnancies, 0. 86 % for normal Italian pregnancies).

40|$|Objective To {{validate}} {{the estimates of}} Global Burden of Disease (GBD) due to congenital anomaly for Europe by comparing infant mortality data collected by EUROCAT registries with the WHO Mortality Database, and by assessing the significance of stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA) {{in the interpretation of}} infant mortality statistics. Design, setting and outcome measures EUROCAT is a network of congenital anomaly registries collecting data on live births, fetal deaths from 20 weeks' gestation and TOPFA. Data from 29 registries in 19 countries were analysed for 2005 - 2009, and infant mortality (deaths of live births at age < 1 year) compared with the WHO Mortality Database. Eight EUROCAT countries were excluded from further analysis on the basis that this comparison showed poor ascertainment of survival status. Results According to WHO, 17 %- 42 % of infant mortality was attributed to congenital anomaly. In 11 EUROCAT countries, average infant mortality with congenital anomaly was 1. 1 per 1000 births, with higher rates where TOPFA is illegal (Malta 3. 0, Ireland 2. 1). The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirths</b> with congenital anomaly was 0. 6 per 1000. The average TOPFA prevalence was 4. 6 per 1000, nearly three times more prevalent than stillbirths and infant deaths combined. TOPFA also impacted on the prevalence of postneonatal survivors with non-lethal congenital anomaly. Conclusions By excluding TOPFA and stillbirths from GBD years of life lost (YLL) estimates, GBD underestimates the burden of disease due to congenital anomaly, and thus declining YLL over time may obscure lack of progress in primary, secondary and tertiary prevention...|$|E
40|$|Stillbirth rate still {{continues}} to be high in the world. Some studies have reported stillbirth rate to be be-tween 10. 4 and 46. 4 per 1000 birth. 1 The aim of this case control {{study was to investigate}} the incidence <b>of</b> <b>stillbirth</b> and the risk factors at Babol hospitals, Northern Iran. A total of 4219 live births and 86 stillbirths were reported in the 7 month period. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirth</b> was 19. 9 per 1000 births (86 / 4305). This rate in a similar study in Kenya 2 and India 1 was 30. 5 and 26. 8 per 1000 births, respectively. As shown in Table 1, demographic characteristics were different in the case and control groups. High mater-nal age (> 35 years) was more in mothers with still-birth than that in those with live birth. Similar to our results, a study in Sweden showed an increased ris...|$|R

A case study by Henry H.

40|$|Lysine {{requirements}} for gain in maternal body reserves and piglet birth weight, during pregnancy, in contemporary prolific genotypes, {{are not well}} established. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary lysine in late pregnancy on piglet birth weight, and on the gestational and lactational performance of gilts. Pregnant gilts were uniformly distributed into two groups and received, from 85 to 110 days of gestation, either of two lysine levels in their diet: Control group - 28 g lysine/day (n= 136), and Lysine group - 35 g lysine/day (n= 141). There were no effects (P> 0. 10) of supplemental lysine on body weight and backfat (BF) gain of females or on piglet birth weight. Gilts supplemented with lysine tended to have a lower percentage of stillbirths (P= 0. 077), reduced within-litter birth weight variation (P= 0. 094) and a lower percentage of piglets weighing less than 1100 g (P= 0. 082) than in the Control group. During lactation, the performance of sows and litters was also evaluated in a subgroup of sows (n= 26 /group). There were no differences between the Control and Lysine groups (P> 0. 10) in voluntary feed intake, body reserve losses (weight and BF), weaning-to-estrus interval of the sows, and litter weaning weight. In conclusion, an increase in lysine (from 28 to 35 g/day) in late gestation of gilts (85 to 110 days) tends to reduce the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirths</b> and to improve the uniformity of litter weight at birth, but {{does not affect the}} performance of females until farrowing or during subsequent lactation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Stillbirths are insufficiently {{reported}} in many countries. In Nablus, reporting has recently started; little is published in Palestine on the stillbirth rate and its risk factors. Objective: To study the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirths</b> at Rafidia Hospital in 2010 {{and some of}} its risk factors. Design: A retrospective cohort design. Methods: Data were collected from the delivery registry for all births and we analysed those with a gestation of 28 weeks or more at Rafidia Hospital. Stillbirth rates were estimated for available determinants. Results: In 2010, a total of 5, 644 women gave birth to 5, 782 babies, of whom 41 were stillbirths, that is, a stillbirth rate of 7. 1 / 1, 000 births (95 % confidence interval 5. 2 – 9. 5). Premature babies had a higher risk of being a stillbirth. For small babies, the lower the birth weight the higher was the probability of being a stillbirth, and for babies weighing 4, 500 g or more there was a higher risk of being stillborn. The risk of stillbirth was also higher among babies from mothers with high haemoglobin concentration, but low maternal haemoglobin was not associated with stillbirths. Conclusions: The stillbirth rates at Rafidia hospital assessed in this study compares favourably with the reported national numbers, indicating a good reliability of the on-going registration. The rates were highest among premature births. Stillbirth was linked to low birth weight, foetal macrosomia, and maternal haemoconcentration. We believe the findings identify areas to address when designing antenatal care with the aim of improving perinatal mortality in the country...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the stillbirth rate {{and identify the}} causal factors associated with it in a tertiary hospital. Methods: A retrospective review of records of women who had stillbirths at a tertiary hospital of the Limpopo Province was conducted. The study period was two years from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010. The hospital maternity registers were used to identify the women who gave birth during the study period. Data were collected using a data collection form designed for the study. The data collected included maternal age, parity, gestation, mode of delivery, obstetric complications, infant or foetal’s gender and weight; whether the birth was fresh stillbirth or macerated and cause of stillbirth. Results: There were 5597 deliveries during the two years period of the study. The hospital-based stillbirth rate was 38. 4 per 1000 births, with 71 % being macerated. The majority of women with stillborn infant {{in this study were}} in the age group (24 %) 20 - 34 years, followed by (23 %) aged 35 years and older. Nulliparity was associated with stillbirth. Unexplained intrauterine foetal death, hypertensive disease, placenta abruptio was the leading causes of stillbirth. Conclusion: In this study stillbirth rate seems to be unacceptably high, though less than those reported in other settings. The causal factors associated with it were identified as nulliparity, unexplained intrauterine foetal deaths, hypertensive disease, and placenta abruptio. Because of the high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>stillbirths</b> reported in this study, it is recommended that interventions be made to introduce fetal autopsies at the tertiary healthcare facilities and that an educational intervention aimed teaching pregnant women be instituted. </p...|$|E
