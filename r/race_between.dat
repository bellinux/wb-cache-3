5|$|Predators and prey {{interact}} and coevolve, the predator {{to catch the}} prey more effectively, the prey to escape. The coevolution of the two mutually imposes selective pressures.

5|$|In 1982, W.D. Hamilton {{proposed}} a specific but widely applicable handicap mechanism, parasite-mediated sexual selection. He {{argued that in}} the never-ending co-evolutionary <b>race</b> <b>between</b> hosts and their parasites, sexually selected signals indicate health. This idea was tested in 1994 in barn swallows, a species where males have long tail streamers. Møller found that the males with longer tails, and their offspring, did have fewer bloodsucking mites, whereas fostered young did not. The effect was therefore genetic, confirming Hamilton's theory.|$|E

McCalmont declined as {{he did not want}} to disrupt his horse's preparation for the Ascot Gold Cup.|$|E

5|$|Minas Geraes, spelled Minas Gerais in some sources, was a {{dreadnought}} battleship of the Brazilian Navy.

5|$|Each {{party in}} a coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts selective pressures on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between species, as well as competition within or between species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms <b>race</b> <b>between</b> the species involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, between exactly two species, {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E
5|$|Fürst Bismarck was {{designed}} before the naval arms <b>race</b> <b>between</b> Germany and the United Kingdom. Admiral Hollmann was the State Secretary of the Naval Office at the time. Given {{the dominance of}} the British Royal Navy and the impossibility, as he saw it, of competing with it, Hollmann envisaged a small fleet consisting of torpedo boats and coastal defense ships to be based in German waters. This would be supplemented by a number of cruisers for overseas duties, including trade protection.|$|E
