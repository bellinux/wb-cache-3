5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} have a long-distance migration, seemingly timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the <b>rainy</b> and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the <b>rainy</b> season begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, during the <b>rainy</b> season, wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.|$|E

5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape during the <b>rainy</b> season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms}} of soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} <b>rainy</b> season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E
