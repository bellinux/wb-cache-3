40|$|In this study, it {{was shown}} that {{improvements}} {{in the quality of}} continuously cast steel billets, similar to those which can be achieved by electromagnetic stirring (EMS) of the liquid pool during solidification, can be obtained if casting superheats can be consistently controlled at low levels. A lack of casting temperature control is not only detrimental {{to the quality of the}} cast product, but also to a shop's overall productivity. The important variables for temperature control in the ladle, tundish and mould were quantified and possible methods of controlling these variables were proposed. The thermal state of the ladle lining is one of the major contributors to the variability in casting temperature. It was shown that by reducing energy losses from the refractory ladle lining, by way of incorporating an insulating <b>refractory</b> <b>tile</b> between the ladle shell and the safety lining and by using a ladle lid throughout the cycle of the ladle, temperature losses from the liquid steel can be substantially decreased.

40|$|Bulk {{vitrification}} (BV) {{was selected}} for a pilot-scale test and demonstration facility for supplemental treatment to accelerate the cleanup of low-activity waste (LAW) at the Hanford U. S. DOE Site. During engineering-scale (ES) tests, {{a small fraction of}} radioactive Tc (and Re, its nonradioactive surrogate) were transferred out of the LAW glass feed and molten LAW glass, and deposited on the surface and within the pores of the castable refractory block (CRB). Laboratory experiments were undertaken to understand the mechanisms of the transport Tc/Re into the CRB during vitrification and to evaluate various means of CRB protection against the deposition of leachable Tc/Re. The tests used Re as a chemical surrogate for Tc. The tests with the baseline CRB showed that the molten LAW penetrates into CRB pores before it converts to glass, leaving deposits of sulfates and chlorides when the nitrate components decompose. Na 2 O from the LAW reacts with the CRB to create a durable glass phase that may contain Tc/Re. Limited data from a single CRB sample taken from an ES experiment indicate that, while a fraction of Tc/Re is present in the CRB in a readily leachable form, most of the Tc/Re deposited in the refractory is retained {{in the form of a}} durable glass phase. In addition, the molten salts from the LAW, mainly sulfates, chlorides, and nitrates, begin to evaporate from BV feeds at temperatures below 800 C and condense on solid surfaces at temperatures below 530 C. Three approaches aimed at reducing or preventing the deposition of soluble Tc/Re within the CRB were proposed: metal lining, sealing the CRB surface with a glaze, and lining the CRB with ceramic tiles. Metal liners were deemed unsuitable because evaluations showed that they can cause unacceptable distortions of the electric field in the BV system. Sodium silicate and a low-alkali borosilicate glaze were selected for testing. The glazes slowed down molten salt condensate penetration, but did little to reduce the penetration of molten salt. Out of several <b>refractory</b> <b>tile</b> candidates, only greystone and fused-cast alumina-zirconia-silica (AZS) refractory remained intact and well bonded to the CRB after firing to 1000 C. The deformation of the refractory-tile composite was avoided by prefiring the greystone tile to 800 C. Condensed vapors did not penetrate the tiles, but Re salts condensed on their surface. Refractory corrosion tests indicated that a 0. 25 -inch-thick greystone tile would not corrode during a BV melt. Tiles can reduce both vapor penetration and molten salt penetration, but vapor deposition above the melt line will occur even on tiles. The Tc/Re transport scenario was outlined as follows. At temperatures below 700 C, molten ionic salt (MIS) that includes all the Tc/Re penetrates, by capillarity, from the feed into the CRB open porosity. At approximately 750 C, the MIS decomposes through the loss of NOx, leaving mainly sulfate and chloride salts. The Na 2 O formed in the decomposition of the nitrates reacts with insoluble grains in the feed and with the aluminosilicates in the CRB to form more viscous liquids that reduce further liquid penetration into the CRB. At 800 to 1000 C, a continuous glass phase traps the remains of the MIS in the form of inclusions in the bulk glass melt. At 1000 to 1200 C, the salt inclusions in the glass slowly dissolve but also rise to the surface. The Tc/Re salts also evaporate from the free surface of the glass melt that is rapidly renewed by convective currents. The vapors condense on cooler surfaces in the upper portion of the CRB, the box lid, and the off-gas system...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOxide bonded {{silicon carbide}} {{refractories}} are used successfully in solid waste-to-energy facilities (WtE). They are submitted to severe thermochemical stresses that limit their performance. Even if the corrosion resistance of silicon carbide is high, wear and failure of refractory lining are currently observed. For {{a better understanding}} of corrosion mechanisms, oxide bonded silicon carbide refractories, collected in the combustion chamber of several WtE facilities, were examined. The main mechanisms of corrosion, according to the environment of refractories, were determined. The chemical composition {{and the nature of the}} corrosive agents were calculated from the thermo-chemical modeling. They are mainly condensed phases of sulfates and chlorides (CaSO 4, K 2 SO 4, Na 2 SO 4, KCl, and NaCl). In service conditions, these molten salts react with the SiC aggregates and the matrix of the refractories to form low melting compounds. The post-mortem analyses showed the formation of para-wollastonite in the porosity and around the SiC grains, on the hot face of <b>refractory</b> <b>tiles.</b> Other phases such as cristobalite and microline (KAlSiO 8) were also formed down to the core of refractories. The volume expansion created by the formation of new mineral phases (cristobalite, para-wollastonite) causes the formation of micro cracks in the refractory lining.

Two such tiles and caowool packed in glass columns {{were used for the}} immobilization of Acidithioba-cillus ferrooxidans cells in a ferrous iron medium, which was percolated through the supports. Colonization was carried out by several media replacements with no further inoculation until maximum ferric iron productivity was reached. One of the tiles was discarded due to the high iron precipitation during bacterial growth. The columns with the other supports were used for ferrous iron oxidation in batch and continuous flow modes of operation and these appeared to be promising supports for A. ferrooxidans. A ferrous iron oxidation rate of 14. 5 mmol. l – 1. h – 1 was reached in one of the columns in the continuous culture. After being used for several cultures, pieces of tiles with immobilized cells were stored at 4 ºC.

The chemical analysis of the clay showed silica (48. 3 %) and alumina (21. 7 %) as the main constituents while other metal oxides such as Fe 2 O 3 (6. 8 %), Na 2 O (2. 9 %), K 2 O (2. 7 %), MgO (1. 2 %), CaO (0. 9 %) and MnO (0. 3 %) are present in minute quantities. As the firing temperature increased from 900 to 1200 oC, the analysis varied from 2. 98 to 10. 56 for linear shrinkage, 34. 01 to 27. 02 % for apparent porosity, 2. 52 to 2. 37 g/cm 3 apparent density and 1. 66 to 1. 73 g/cm 3 bulk.

40|$|Rigid fibrous <b>refractory</b> insulations (TPS <b>tiles)</b> are {{integral}} components of many spacecraft thermal protection systems. These materials {{are composed of}} refractory fibers With diameters {{on the order of}} 1 to 15 micrometers. They are lightweight and have an open, highly porous microstructure. Typical densities are less than 500 kilograms per cubic meters, and porosities generally exceed 0. 8. Because of their open porosity, these materials are permeable to gas glow. There are numerous instances in which internal gas transport in a thermal protection system could be important; examples include the penetration of hot boundary-layer gases into the insulation, the flow of decomposition (pyrolysis) products from the interior, the use of convective flows to mitigate ice formation caused by cryopumping, and the design of refractory vents for pressure equilibration during atmospheric entry. Computational analysis of gas flow through porous media requires values of permeability which have not previously been available for the rigid fibrous insulations used in thermal protection systems.
