40|$|Objectives. We {{evaluated}} {{patient and}} procedural characteristics {{that influence the}} midterm success of balloon dilation of congenital aortic stenosis. Background. Balloon dilation is a new treatment for congenital aortic stenosis. Factors that influence midterm success are unknown. Methods. We performed a retrospective review of 148 children > 1 month old who underwent balloon dilation for aortic stenosis. Results. Balloon dilation was successful in 87 % of patients, with a procedural mortality rate of 0. 7 %. The average immediate peak to peak gradient reduction was 56. 4 ± 19. 9 % (mean ± SD). Prior valvotomy was the only factor that significantly reduced the immediate gradient reduction after dilation (47. 1 ± 21. 8 % vs. 57. 8 ± 19. 6 %, p < 0. 01). Survival after dilation was 95 % at 8 years. Seventy-five percent of patients were free of <b>repeat</b> <b>intervention</b> 4 years after dilation, whereas 50 % remained free of <b>repeat</b> <b>intervention</b> at 8 years. Asymmetrically thick valve leaflets (risk ratio [RR] 0. 17, p < 0. 01) and prior aortic valvotomy (RR 0. 35, p = 0. 02) decreased the risk of <b>repeat</b> <b>intervention.</b> Aortic regurgitation grade ≥ 3 (RR 4. 27, p = 0. 04) and residual gradient after dilation (RR 1. 63 for 10 mm Hg, p < 0. 01) increased the risk.

Frequency of <b>repeat</b> <b>intervention</b> was estimated, with monitoring of hospital admissions of patients operated on {{for the first time}} beetween January 2005 and June 2007. 175, 000 stents were billed in 2007 in France, at a cost of 158 million euros. The public sector is responsible for 54 % of volume and 48 % of billed costs. Drug-elutingstents accounted for 40 % of all implanted stents and 67 % of billed costs. In the 62, 500 hospital stays identified in the public sector(57 % of stays) there was a lower rate of stays with no myocardial infarction and no complication (43 %, compared with 55 % in the private sector) and a lower proportion of drug-eluting stents inserted (34 % compared with 47 %). The mean price of a hospital stay, not including stent cost, is € 4800 in the public sector and € 5053 in the private sector.

40|$|The EPIC trial {{demonstrated}} the potent platelet IIb/ 1 l 1 a inhibitor, c 7 E 3 reduced {{the incidence of}} acute complications in high risk angioplasty. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), repeat urgent PTCA or CABG, and emergency stent or balloon pump insertion.

To further characterize the mechanism of effect of potent platelet antagonism during angioplasty, we determined c 7 E 3 's efficacy {{according to the most}} seriousendpoint reached.

40|$|Purpose: To {{report the}} {{clinical}} outcome of stent-assisted below-the-ankle angioplasty for limb salvage {{in the setting}} of critical limb ischemia (CLI). Methods: A retrospective single-center study was conducted of 40 critical ischemic limbs in 31 patients (mean age 6768 years, range 46 – 94) undergoing below-the-ankle stent-assisted angioplasty between April 2006 and April 2009. Coronary bare metal stents were implanted in cases of failed balloon angioplasty due to significant recoil, flow-limiting dissection, abrupt closure, or repeat early reocclusion. Results: Technical success was 93 % (37 limbs), with 3 failures to cross the occlusive lesions. Acute or subacute occlusion was evident in 9 (23 %) limbs. The number of runoff vessels increased significantly (p, 0. 001) from 0. 660. 8 to 1. 860. 8.

40|$|Stent {{implantation}} {{has become}} the mainstay of percutaneous revascularization for most coronary lesions; in-stent restenosis (ISR) can occur in 6 %– 40 % of stent procedures and the subsequent response to <b>repeat</b> <b>intervention</b> can possibly be predicted by the angiographic patterns of ISR. This study evaluated the incidence and predictors of angiographic patterns of ISR {{and its impact on}} subsequent target lesion revascularization (TLR) in 100 consecutive patients having Palmaz-Schatz ISR undergoing intervention. Diffuse ISR (H 10 mm) was observed in 78 % and focal ISR (G 10 mm) in 22 %. Diffuse vs. focal ISR occurred earlier after stent implantation and was more common in diabetics. Angiographic predictors of diffuse ISR were stent implantation for a restenotic lesion, long lesions, smaller vessel, stenting without debulking, and high-pressure balloon inflation (G 16 atm). TLR after <b>repeat</b> <b>intervention</b> was 46 % for diffuse and 14 % for focal ISR (P F 0. 02). Rotational atherectomy resulted in lower TLR (31 %) vs. PTCA or restent (64 %) in diffuse ISR (P F 0. 004). Therefore, diffuse ISR is more common than focal ISR, usually occurs in the setting of aggressive intimal hyperplasia, and can be predicted by clinical and angiographic variables. Also, diffuse intimal hyperplasia within a stent responds poorly to PTCA and may benefit from a more aggressive debulking strategy such as rotationa...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} assess the fate of stent (ST) -related side {{branches}} (SB) after coronary intervention in patients with in-ST restenosis. BACKGROUNDIn-ST restenosis constitutes a therapeutic challenge. Although the fate of lesion-related SB after conventional angioplasty or initial coronary stenting is well established, the outcome of ST-related SB in patients with in-ST restenosis undergoing <b>repeat</b> <b>intervention</b> is unknown. METHODSOne hundred consecutive patients (age 61 ± 11 years, 22 women) undergoing <b>repeat</b> <b>intervention</b> for in-ST restenosis (101 ST) were prospectively studied. Two hundred and twenty-six SB spanned by the ST were identified. The SB size, type, ostium involvement, location within the ST and take-off angle were evaluated. The SB TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial) flow grade was studied in detail before, during, immediately after the procedure, and at late angiography. RESULTSOcclusion (TIMI flow grade = 0) was produced in 24 (10 %) SB, whereas some degree of flow deterioration (≥ 1 TIMI flow grade) was observed in 57 SB (25 %). The SB occlusion was associated with non–Q wave myocardial infarction in two patients (both had large and diseased SB). Side-branch occlusion {{at the time of}} initial stenting (RR [relative risk] 11. 1, 95 % CI [confidence interval] 3. 5 – 35. 5, p < 0. 001), diabetes (RR 3. 5, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 10. 5, p = 0. 02), SB ostium involvement (RR 5. 0, 95 % CI 1. 4 – 17. 2, p = 0. 004), baseline SB TIMI flow grade < 3 (RR 5. 5, 95 % CI 1. 7 – 18. 1, p = 0. 005), and restenosis length (RR 1. 05 95 % CI 1. 01 – 1. 11, p = 0. 03) were identified as independent predictors of SB occlusion. Late angiography in 19 initially occluded SB revealed that 17 (89 %) were patent again. The long-term clinical event-free survival (81 % vs. 82 % at two years) in patients with and without initial SB occlusion was similar. CONCLUSIONSOcclusion or flow deterioration of SB spanned by the ST is relatively common during <b>repeat</b> <b>intervention</b> for in-ST restenosis.

Results: Among 431 patients who underwent resection or RFA for CRLMs, 305 patients developed recurrences for which 160 <b>repeat</b> <b>interventions</b> (resection and/or RFA or ablative radiotherapy) were performed. In total, after 707 first or <b>repeat</b> <b>interventions,</b> 516 recurrences (73. 0 per cent) developed, of which 276 were retreated curatively. At the time of first intervention, independent risk factors for death were lymph node-positive primary tumour (hazard ratio (HR) 1. 40; P = 0. 030), more than oneCRLM(HR 1. 53; P = 0. 007), carcinoembryonic antigen level exceeding 200 ng/ml (HR 1. 89; P = 0. 020) and size of largest CRLM greater than 5 cm (HR 1. 54; P = 0. 014).

40|$|Background—The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{long-term}} outcomes of children randomized to surgery or balloon angioplasty (BA) for native coarctation (CoA). A prior randomized, short-term comparison of BA and surgery for native CoA in 36 children demonstrated equivalent relief of obstruction. The risk of aneurysm formation and possibly restenosis was higher among patients treated with BA. Methods and Results—Blood pressure, residual aortic obstruction, and exercise performance were evaluated. Need for <b>repeat</b> <b>intervention</b> was reviewed. Aortic arch anatomy was assessed with magnetic resonance angiography. For subjects who were not available to return for evaluation, the most recent clinical record was utilized. Among the 36 subjects initially randomized, 21 returned for evaluation (11 BA, 10 surgery). The average time since initial intervention to evaluation for all subjects was 10. 64. 7 years for BA subjects and 11. 33. 7 years for surgical subjects. Resting blood pressure, CoA gradient, exercise performance, MRI analysis of the aortic arch, and need for repeat interventions were not different for the 2 treatment strategies. There was a higher incidence of aneurysm formation (35 % versus 0 %) and a greater difference in blood pressure between the right and left legs with exercise among BA subjects.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{evaluated}} the long-term clinical outcome of successful repeat percutaneous intervention after in-stent restenosis. Background. Recurrence of symptoms and angiographic restenosis after stent implantation are observed in 15 % to 35 % of cases. Repeat percutaneous treatment for in-stent restenosis {{has been shown}} to be safe, with high immediate success, but little is known about the long-term clinical outcome. Methods. Clinical follow-up (minimum 9 months) was obtained in a consecutive series of 124 patients (127 vessels) presenting with stent restenosis who were successfully treated with repeat percutaneous intervention. Results. Clinical follow-up was obtained in all 124 patients at a mean [±SD] of 27. 4 ± 14. 7 months (range 9 to 66); a stress test was available in 88 patients (71 %). Recurrence of clinical events occurred in 25 patients (20 %) and included death from any cause in 2 patients (2 %), target vessel revascularization in 14 (11 %), myocardial infarction in 1 (1 %) and positive stress test results or recurrence of symptoms (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class I to IV) treated medically in 8 (6 %). Cumulative event-free survival at 12 and 24 months was 86. 2 % and 80. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|Objectives. This study investigates whether <b>repeat</b> {{coronary}} <b>interventions,</b> applied over {{an extended}} time period, can successfully curtail the progression of ischemic symptoms and angiographic lumen narrowing. Background. Coronary artery disease is a chronic and generally progressive disorder, and potential treatment strategies should be examined and compared with this chronicity in mind. Percutaneous interventional revascularization procedures could theoretically be useful in controlling progression of the disease through repeated use as new coronary lesions arise. However, {{the outcome of this}} long-term management concept has not previously been subjected to detailed investigation. Methods. From a consecutive series of 4, 357 interventional cardiac procedures, 544 patients were identified who received two or more interventions during the 13 -year study period. These patients were categorized into one of three groups: restenosis (<b>repeat</b> <b>interventions</b> limited to the same target segment, N = 261), new stenosis (all <b>repeat</b> <b>interventions</b> directed to stenoses not previously treated, N = 155) or both (<b>repeat</b> <b>interventions</b> directed both to the same and to different target lesions, N = 128). Results. Two to five procedures were performed per patient; the time period (mean ± SD) separating each procedure was significantly less (p < 0. 0001) for the restenosis group (4. 2 ± 2. 3 months) than for the new stenosis (24. 2 ± 23. 5 months) or the “both” groups (11. 4 ± 11. 0 months). Despite the need for repeat procedures, the severity of angina (mean New York Heart Association functional class 1. 6 ± 0. 9) after 6. 2 ± 2. 3 years of follow-up was substantially better than before the initial procedure (mean functional class 3. 2 ± 0. 8), with a similar magnitude of change found in all three groups. This long-term functional improvement was mirrored by a corresponding anatomic improvement, with the mean number of diseased vessels remaining constant at the time of each procedure (1. 5 ± 0. 7, 1. 5 ± 0. 7 and 1. 6 ± 0. 7, respectively, for the first, second and third procedures, P = NS). The restenosis and the new stenosis groups also demonstrated statistically similar annual rates of mortality (1. 9 % vs. 1. 8 %) and coronary surgery (2. 3 % vs. 2. 6 %), although the restenosis group had a lower rate of infarction (1. 4 % vs. 3. 2 %, P = 0. 002). Conclusions. Repeat interventional treatment of newly acquired stenoses provides a rational approach for the long-term management of chronic coronary artery disease. In addition to yielding a favorable late outcome, the use of this strategy can result in sustained functional improvement and can check the progression of clinically significant stenoses...|$|R
40|$|Management of {{patients}} with in-stent restenosis (ISR) remains an important clinical problem. Although drug-eluting stents (DES) have drastically reduced the incidence of ISR, treatment of DES-ISR is particularly challenging. ISR mainly results from aggressive neointimal proliferation, but recent data also suggest that neoatherosclerosis may play an important pathophysiological role. Intracoronary imaging provides unique insights to unravel the underlying substrate of ISR and {{may be used to}} guide <b>repeated</b> <b>interventions.</b> In this paper, we systematically reviewed clinical trial data with currently available therapeutic modalities, including DES and drug-coated balloons, in patients presenting with ISR within bare-metal stents or DES...|$|R

To investigate {{the persistence of}} such interventions, we randomly assigned households to moral suasion and dynamic pricing that stimulate energy conservation during peak demand hours. Using household-level consumption data for 30 -minute intervals, we find significant short-run effects of moral suasion, but the effects diminished quickly after <b>repeated</b> <b>interventions.</b> Economic incentives produced larger and persistent effects, which induced habit formation after the final interventions. While each policy produces substantial welfare gains, economic incentives provide particularly large gains when we consider persistence...|$|R
