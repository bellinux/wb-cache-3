These studies {{were conducted by}} incubating solid (e. g., freeze-dried) proteins at elevated temperatures (37 0 C) and various moisture levels via sorption from the vapor phase (relative humidities ranging from 11 - 97 %). For all three proteins, storage in such conditions (which mimic those for proteins loaded within a polymeric depot intended for sustained release) resulted in marked aggregation as revealed upon subsequent reconstitution in aqueous media.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relative importance of the metabolic effects of insulin for diabetes prevention by administering insulin or an inactive insulin analog by daily subcutaneous injections to prediabetic mice. A <b>recombinant</b> monomeric <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> analog, which does not bind to the insulin receptor as a consequence of an alteration of a single amino acid at position 25 of the B chain, was shown to be equally effective at diabetes prevention as was intact insulin. In contrast to native insulin, the insulin analog did not cause hypoglycemia after subcutaneous injection. The insulin analog, however, protected young adult mice from diabetes, even when it was initiated after the onset of extensive lymphocytic infiltration of the islets.

An intriguing observation regarding melioidosis is that a significant percentage of patients who develop the disease have preexisting diabetes mellitus. In this regard, we have tested the hypothesis that insulin may modulate the growth of P. pseudomallei. We have demonstrated that insulin markedly inhibits the growth of P. pseudomallei in vitro and in vivo. The growth rate of P. pseudomallei in minimal medium containing <b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>insulin</b> was significantly lower than that of control cultures containing no insulin. P. pseudomallei grew at an increased rate in serum samples obtained from diabetic rats compared with that in serum samples obtained from control animals.

50|$|Increase in {{the demand}} for {{recombinant}} insulin {{can be explained by}} {{an increase in the number}} of diabetic patients globally, as well as alternative delivery methods such as inhalation and oral routes, which require higher doses. Through the use of recombinant DNA technology, E. coli can be used for the production of human insulin. The biosynthesis of insulin within the human body confers a significant advantage over bovine or porcine synthesis, which are often immunogenic in diabetic patients. To accomplish this, synthetic genes for human insulin are fused with the β-galactosidase gene of E.coli, where they undergo transcription and ultimately translation into proteins. The limiting factor for the use of microorganisms like E. coli in biosynthesis of gene products like insulin is time, yet due to advancements in the synthesis of oligonucleotides and liquid chromatography, the production time needed for DNA fragments has greatly decreased. <b>Recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> was first approved for clinical trials in 1980. At this time the A and B chains of insulin were produced separately and then chemically joined. Joining of the two chains was often carried out through air oxidation with low efficiency. A 1978 study by Goedell et al. successfully accomplished correct joining of the A and B chains through S-sulfonated derivatives and an excess of the A chain, resulting in 50-80% correct joining. Recent advances have allowed the chains to be synthesized together by inserting the human proinsulin gene into E. coli cells, which produce proinsulin through fermentation.|$|E

Methods: 108 people with T 2 DM and CLD were randomly allocated to RHI or lispro according to a 12 + 12 week cross-over protocol. A 1 -week continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) session was performed {{at the end of}} each treatment period followed by a standard meal test with a 12 IU lispro or RHI shot ahead. Results: CGM showed higher glycemic excursions under RHI than under lispro (p < 0. 01) with lower glucose levels in the late post-absorption phase (p < 0. 05) and even more during the night (p < 0. 01). Post-challenge incremental areas under the curve (δAUC) were undistinguishable for insulin but lower for glucose, while insulin peaked higher and earlier and glycemic excursions were lower with lispro than with RHI (0. 05 < p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Lispro granted lower early postprandial glucose levels and late postprandial hypoglycemic rates and therefore might represent the treatment of choice for people with T 2 DM and compensated CLD. This might depend on its faster/shorter-living effects, as well as, on the lower liver glucose output expected from its earlier hepatic distribution...|$|R

On both nights a somatostatin analog infusion (300 ng/kg x h) suppressed endogenous GH production, and three timed discrete GH pulses (total, 0. 029 IU/kg x night) ensured identical GH levels. After <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> IGF-I administration, IGF-I levels and the IGF-I/IGF-binding protein- 3 ratio increased [mean +/- SEM:IGF-I, 401 +/- 22 ng/ml; placebo, 256 +/- 20 ng/ml (P = 0. 0002); IGF-I, 0. 108 +/- 0. 006; placebo, 0. 074 +/- 0. 004 (P = 0. 0003), respectively], and insulin requirements decreased (IGF-I, 0. 12 +/- 0. 03; placebo, 0. 23 +/- 0. 03 U/kg x min; P = 0. 008). The normal within-individual inverse relationships between insulin and IGF-binding protein- 1 levels were observed (lag time 2 h: r = - 0. 34; P < 0. 01).

Refinement carried out with anisotropic displacement parameters, removal of main-chain stereochemical restraints, inclusion of H atoms in calculated positions, and 220 water molecules, converged to a final value of R =  0. 1112 and Rfree =  0. 1466. The structure includes what is thought to be an ordered propanol molecule (POL) only in chain D(4) and a solvated acetate molecule (ACT) coordinated to the Zn atom only in chain B(2). Possible origins and consequences of the propanol and acetate molecules are discussed. Three types of amino acid representation in the electron density are examined in detail: (i) sharp with very clearly resolved features; (ii) well resolved but clearly divided into two conformations which are well behaved in the refinement, both having high quality geometry; (iii) poor density and difficult or impossible to model. An example of type (ii) is observed for the intra-chain disulphide bridge in chain C(3) between Sγ 6 -Sγ 11 which has two clear conformations with relative refined occupancies of 0. 8 and 0. 2, respectively. In contrast the corresponding S-S bridge in chain A(1) shows one clearly defined conformation. A molecular dynamics study has provided a rational explanation of this difference between chains A and C. More generally, differences in the electron density features between corresponding residues in chains A and C and chains B and D is a common observation in the Insugen (I) structure and these effects are discussed in detail.

In the Intergen (II) structure there is no solvated propanol or acetate molecule. The electron density of Intergen (II), however, does also exhibit the three types of amino acid representations as in Insugen (I). These effects do not necessarily correspond between chains A and C or chains B and D in Intergen (II), or between corresponding residues in Insugen (I). The results of this comparison are reported.

Instead of increasing allergy reactions, CSII has been reported to represent a successful alternative treatment in diabetic patients presenting local or generalized allergy to insulin or other components (zinc, protamine) of conventional treatment. Most recent reports concern CSII-treated patients using short-acting insulin analogues (essentially insulin lispro), although the precise role of these insulin analogues remains unclear as allergy to them has also been described. Finally, data on antigenicity and immunogenicity of long-acting insulin analogues (glargine, detemir), which may mimic the basal insulin delivery with CSII, remain scarce at present.

40|$|Aims To compare {{full-length}} mechano {{growth factor}} (full-length MGF) with <b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and <b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>insulin</b> (HI) {{in their ability}} to activate the human IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), the <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> receptor (IR-A) and the <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> receptor-B (IR-B), respectively. In addition, we tested the stimulatory activity of human MGF and its stabilized analog Goldspink-MGF on the IGF-IR. Methods The effects of full-length MGF, IGF-I, human mechano growth factor (MGF), Goldspink-MGF and HI were compared using kinase specific receptor activation (KIRA) bioassays specific for IGF-I, IR-A or IR-B, respectively. These assays quantify activity by measuring auto-phosphorylation of the receptor upon ligand binding. Results IGF-IR: At high equimolar concentrations maximal IGF-IR stimulating effects generated by full-length MGF were similar to that of IGF-I (89 -fold vs. 77 -fold, respectively). However, EC 50 values of IGF-I and full-length MGF for the IGF-I receptor were 0. 86 nmol/L (95 % CI 0. 69 - 1. 07) and 7. 83 nmol/L (95 % CI: 4. 87 - 12. 58), respectively. No IGF-IR activation was observed by human MGF and Goldspink-MGF, respectively. IR-A/IR-B: At high equimolar concentrations similar maximal IR-A stimulating effects were observed for full -length MGF and HI, but maximal IR-B stimulation achieved by full -length MGF was stronger than that by HI (292 -fold vs. 98 -fold). EC 50 values of HI and full-length MGF for the IR-A were 1. 13 nmol/ L (95 % CI 0. 69 - 1. 84) and 73. 11 nmol/L (42. 87 - 124. 69), respectively; for IR-B these values were 1. 28 nmol/L (95 % CI 0. 64 - 2. 57) and 35. 10 nmol/L (95 % 17. 52 - 70. 33), respectively. Conclusions Full-length MGF directly stimulates the IGF-IR. Despite a higher EC 50 concentration, at high equimolar concentrations full-length MGF showed a similar maximal potency to activate the IGF-IR as compared to IGF-I. Further research is needed to understand the actions of full-length MGF in vivo and to define the physiological relevance of our in vitro findings...|$|R
