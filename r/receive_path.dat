40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we propose}} {{exploiting}} ASK-PSK modulated stamp in <b>receiving</b> <b>path</b> selection technique {{to lessen the}} phase cancellation effect in augmented ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) indoor localization system (AURIS). In AURIS, a tag-like semi-passive RFID component (referred as sensatag) can capture backscatter signal of other proximal tags with presence of RF source. According {{to the principle of}} backscatter radio link, the received signal at sensatag antenna is the superposition of backscatter signal of tags and continuous carrier wave (CW) from RF source. However, due to phase difference between tag's backscatter signal and RF CW, the modulated backscatter signal could be cancelled. We refer this effect as phase cancellation effect. Exploiting the spatial diversity of dual-antenna's two <b>receiving</b> <b>paths,</b> the likelihood of phase cancellation occurrence could be reduced. But the developed technique with two co-operating paths is not energy efficient. Therefore, this paper proposes to inject a ASK-PSK modulated stamp sequence in the pilot tone of backscatter signal as a signature of phase cancellation for ASK modulated data frame, which could be identified by the receiving sensatag. With the knowledge of occurrence of phase cancellation, sensatag could activate the alternative <b>receiving</b> <b>path.</b> This technique fully exploits the space diversity of dual-antenna, and also reduces the power consumption by reducing one <b>receiving</b> <b>path</b> in operation. We demonstrate the performance of stamp based <b>receiving</b> <b>path</b> selection technique with data obtained from computer simulation...|$|R

One example of this is the use of the optional XAUI with the 10GBASE-LX4 8b/10b PHY, where the XGXS interfacing to the Reconciliation Sublayer provides the PCS and PMA functionality required by the PHY. An XGXS layer is not required at the PHY end of the XAUI in this case. However, means may still be required to remove jitter introduced on the XAUI in order to meet PHY jitter requirements.|$|E

Continuing the signal {{passes through a}} low pass filter, continues through the RF Directional Coupler/Power Detector (not used in rx) through low pass filters selected by relays as appropriate for current rx frequency. The combination of lo- and hi-pass filters provide broadband bandpass filtering to the rx front end. For 6 m the hi-pass filter includes a preamplifier (always used on 6 m rx and not affected by the IPO menu setting). The appropriate high pass filter output is selected with a PIN diode with logic levels. The output from the PIN diodes are routed to the MAIN unit. Here the rx signal is applied to dual PIN diode modules (type DAP236U). One path routes the signal directly between the two modules and the other path passes the signal through a 10 db pad - the pad that is switched in as a menu item. The output is then passed through a simple lo-pass filter to another DAP236U. One of the outputs is applied to a preamplifier {{and the other is}} applied to a diode, bypassing the preamplifier. The output of the diode is applied to an IF trap. The purpose of which is to prevent 68.33 MHz energy from the antenna from getting into the 1st IF.

40|$|The MIL-STD- 188 - 110 A Single Tone high {{frequency}} modem {{is used by}} the United States military everyday as a beyond line-of-sight radio. Typically, beyond line-of-sight military radios use satellites for reflection. Satellite time is in high demand, and since there are a finite number of satellites in orbit, it makes over-the-air time expensive. The Single Tone {{high frequency}} modem offers a reliable alternative by using the ionosphere, rather than a satellite, for reflection. The ionosphere adds unique channel effects, causing the signal processing software to be more complex and harder to debug than radios which use satellites. Before being placed into production, the MIL-STD- 188 - 110 A Single Tone high frequency modem is placed under comprehensive performance tests. These tests are meant to fully verify all aspects of the software and to impose all possible channel effects such as additive white Gaussian noise, doppler shift, terminal clock differences, frequency and time dispersion. When a test fails, debugging the software can be tedious and time consuming. The two major steps to quick and successful debugging are understanding and isolation.
