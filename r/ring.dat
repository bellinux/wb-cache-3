5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of <b>ring,</b> another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the <b>ring</b> and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} <b>ring</b> and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second <b>ring</b> operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the <b>ring</b> in ways that are not apparent from the <b>ring</b> itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each <b>ring</b> and returns an element of the second <b>ring.</b> This operation makes the second <b>ring</b> into a module over the first. Often the first <b>ring</b> is a field.|$|E

5|$|After {{the match}} ended, David Sammartino, {{accompanied}} by his father Bruno Sammartino, and Brutus Beefcake, accompanied by Johnny Valiant, {{made their way to}} the <b>ring.</b> The action favoured both contestants, as each wrestler alternated having the advantage. After Beefcake threw David Sammartino out of the <b>ring,</b> Valiant lifted him up and slammed him to the cement floor. He then pushed Sammartino back into the <b>ring</b> before being attacked by Bruno. A short while later, all four men began fighting in the <b>ring,</b> and the match ended in a no-contest.|$|E

5|$|After the match, an in <b>ring</b> segment {{took place}} in which The Big Show, entered the <b>ring</b> and asked the crowd whether they thought {{he should have been}} in the Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship. SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} authority figure for the SmackDown brand, then came to the <b>ring</b> and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the <b>ring.</b> Druids then came to the <b>ring</b> bringing a casket, and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either get in the casket herself or he would put her in it. Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the <b>ring.</b> Once he was in the <b>ring,</b> The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him and spit in his face.|$|E
5|$|After the ε <b>ring,</b> the α and β {{rings are}} the {{brightest}} of Uranus's rings. Like the ε <b>ring,</b> they exhibit regular variations in brightness and width. They are brightest and widest 30° from the apoapsis and dimmest and narrowest 30° from the periapsis. The α and β rings have sizable orbital eccentricity and non-negligible inclination. The widths of these rings are 4.8–10km and 6.1–11.4km, respectively. The equivalent optical depths are 3.29km and 2.14km, resulting in normal optical depths of 0.3–0.7 and 0.2–0.35, respectively. During a <b>ring</b> plane-crossing event in 2007 the rings disappeared, {{which means they}} are geometrically thin like the ε <b>ring</b> and devoid of dust. However, the same event revealed a thick and optically thin dust band just outside the β <b>ring,</b> which was also observed earlier by Voyager 2. The masses of the α and β rings {{are estimated to be}} about 5kg (each)—half the mass of the ε <b>ring.</b>|$|E

5|$|An {{outstanding}} problem {{concerning the}} physics governing the narrow Uranian rings is their confinement. Without some mechanism {{to hold their}} particles together, the rings would quickly spread out radially. The lifetime of the Uranian rings without such a mechanism cannot be more than 1million years. The most widely cited model for such confinement, proposed initially by Goldreich and Tremaine, is that a pair of nearby moons, outer and inner shepherds, interact gravitationally with a <b>ring</b> and act like sinks and donors, respectively, for excessive and insufficient angular momentum (or equivalently, energy). The shepherds thus keep <b>ring</b> particles in place, but gradually {{move away from the}} <b>ring</b> themselves. To be effective, the masses of the shepherds should exceed the mass of the <b>ring</b> by at least a factor of two to three. This mechanism is known to be at work {{in the case of the}} ε <b>ring,</b> where Cordelia and Ophelia serve as shepherds. Cordelia is also the outer shepherd of the δ <b>ring,</b> and Ophelia is the outer shepherd of the γ <b>ring.</b> However no moon larger than 10km is known in the vicinity of other rings. The current distance of Cordelia and Ophelia from the ε <b>ring</b> can be used to estimate the ring’s age. The calculations show that the ε <b>ring</b> cannot be older than 600 million years.|$|E

5|$|Early in the Second Age of Middle-earth, elven smiths forge nine Rings of Power for mortal men, seven for the Dwarf-Lords, {{and three}} for the Elf-Kings. Soon after, the Dark Lord Sauron makes the One <b>Ring,</b> and {{uses it to}} attempt to conquer Middle-earth. Following the Last Alliance of Elves and Men's fall, the <b>Ring</b> is seized by Prince Isildur; and after Isildur was killed by orcs, the <b>Ring</b> lies {{at the bottom of}} the river Anduin for over 2,500 years. Over time, Sauron captures the Nine Rings and {{transforms}} their owners into the Ringwraiths. The One <b>Ring</b> is discovered by Déagol, whose friend, Sméagol, kills him and takes the <b>Ring</b> for himself. The <b>Ring</b> twists his body and mind, and he becomes the creature Gollum (Peter Woodthorpe). Hundreds of years later, Bilbo Baggins (Norman Bird) finds the <b>Ring</b> in Gollum's cave and takes it back to the Shire.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Voyager 2 {{detected}} {{a broad and}} faint sheet of material inward of <b>ring</b> 6. This <b>ring</b> was given the temporary designation 1986U2R. It had a normal optical depth of 10−3 or less and was extremely faint. It was visible only in a single Voyager 2 image. The <b>ring</b> was located between 37,000 and 39,500km from the centre of Uranus, or only about 12,000km above the clouds. It was not observed again until 2003–2004, when the Keck telescope found a broad and faint sheet of material just inside <b>ring</b> 6. This <b>ring</b> was dubbed the ζ <b>ring.</b> However, {{the position of the}} recovered ζ <b>ring</b> differs significantly from that observed in 1986. Now it is situated between 37,850 and 41,350km from the centre of the planet. There is an inward gradually fading extension reaching to at least 32,600km, or possibly even to 27,000km—to the atmosphere of Uranus. These extensions are labelled as the ζc and ζcc rings respectively.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter has a faint {{planetary}} <b>ring</b> system {{composed of}} three main segments: an inner torus of particles {{known as the}} halo, a relatively bright main <b>ring,</b> and an outer gossamer <b>ring.</b> These rings appear {{to be made of}} dust, rather than ice as with Saturn's rings. The main <b>ring</b> is probably made of material ejected from the satellites Adrastea and Metis. Material that would normally fall back to the moon is pulled into Jupiter because of its strong gravitational influence. The orbit of the material veers towards Jupiter and new material is added by additional impacts. In a similar way, the moons Thebe and Amalthea probably produce the two distinct components of the dusty gossamer <b>ring.</b> There is also evidence of a rocky <b>ring</b> strung along Amalthea's orbit which may consist of collisional debris from that moon.|$|E

5|$|More generally, {{abstract}} algebra makes great use of matrices with {{entries in}} a <b>ring</b> R. Rings are {{a more general}} notion than fields in that a division operation need not exist.

If the <b>ring</b> R is commutative, that is, its multiplication is commutative, then M(n, R) is a unitary noncommutative (unless n = 1) associative algebra over R. The determinant of square matrices over a commutative <b>ring</b> R can still be defined using the Leibniz formula; such a matrix is invertible {{if and only if}} its determinant is invertible in R, generalising the situation over a field F, where every nonzero element is invertible.
