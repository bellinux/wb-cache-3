40|$|Simple {{and easily}} {{utilized}} techniques are suggested for reliable transmission of binary {{data in the}} presence of atmospheric noise bursts. The techniques utilize the time statistics of the noise bursts, now known to be log-normal, and operate on one-way channels. Two modes of transmission are distinguished. The first mode involves double or triple transmission of an error detection code word. The second mode of transmission is based on burst error correction, provided either by a majority count principle or by the <b>recurrent</b> <b>codes</b> of Hagelbarger. Numerical calculations indicate the superior performance of the error detection techniques...|$|R

A new class of codes with low transmission rate is presented, and the merits of these codes are discussed. A procedure for construction of a generalized code from known codes is presented, and two theorems concerning this construction are proved. Finally, the advantages of various codes with different rates are examined carefully...|$|R
40|$|The genetic basis {{underlying}} the inherited {{risk of developing}} multiple myeloma (MM) is largely unknown. To {{examine the impact of}} rare protein altering variants on the risk of developing MM we analyzed high-coverage exome sequencing data on 513 MM cases and 1, 569 healthy controls, performing both single variant and gene burden tests. We did not identify any <b>recurrent</b> <b>coding</b> low-frequency alleles (1 – 5 %) with moderate effect that were statistically associated with MM. In a gene burden analysis we did however identify a promising relationship between variation in the marrow kinetochore microtubule stromal gene KIF 18 A, which plays a role in control mitotic chromosome positioning dynamics, and risk of MM (P = 3. 6 x 10 − 6). Further analysis showed KIF 18 A displays a distinct pattern of expression across molecular subgroups of MM as well as being associated with patient survival. Our results inform future study design and provide a resource for contextualizing the impact of candidate MM susceptibility genes...|$|R

To examine the role of <b>recurrent</b> <b>coding</b> sequence variation in CRC aetiology, we genotyped 12, 638 CRCs cases and 29, 045 controls from six European populations. Single-variant analysis identified a coding variant (rs 3184504) in SH 2 B 3 (12 q 24) associated with CRC risk (OR = 1. 08, P = 3. 9 × 10 - 7), and novel damaging coding variants in 3 genes previously tagged by GWAS efforts; rs 16888728 (8 q 24) in UTP 23 (OR = 1. 15, P = 1. 4 × 10 - 7); rs 6580742 and rs 12303082 (12 q 13) in FAM 186 A (OR = 1. 11, P = 1. 2 × 10 - 7 and OR = 1. 09, P = 7. 4 × 10 - 8); rs 1129406 (12 q 13) in ATF 1 (OR = 1. 11, P = 8. 3 × 10 - 9), all reaching exome-wide significance levels. Gene based tests identified associations between CRC and PCDHGA genes (P < 2. 90 × 10 - 6). We found an excess of rare, damaging variants in base-excision (P = 2. 4 × 10 - 4) and DNA mismatch repair genes (P = 6. 1 × 10 - 4) consistent with a recessive mode of inheritance. This study comprehensively explores the contribution of coding sequence variation to CRC risk, identifying associations with coding variation in 4 genes and PCDHG gene cluster and several candidate recessive alleles.

40|$|Uveal {{melanoma}} (UM) {{is a rare}} intraocular tumor that, {{similar to}} cutaneous melanoma, originates from melanocytes. To gain insights into its genetics, we performed whole-genome sequencing at very deep coverage of tumor-control pairs in 33 samples (24 primary and 9 metastases). Genome-wide, the number of coding mutations was rather low (only 17 variants per tumor on average; range 7 - 28), thus radically different from cutaneous melanoma, where hundreds of exonic DNA insults are usually detected. Furthermore, no UV light-induced mutational signature was identified. <b>Recurrent</b> <b>coding</b> mutations {{were found in the}} known UM drivers GNAQ, GNA 11, BAP 1, EIF 1 AX, and SF 3 B 1. Other genes, i. e., TP 53 BP 1, CSMD 1, TTC 28, DLK 2, and KTN 1, were also found to harbor somatic mutations in more than one individual, possibly indicating a previously undescribed association with UM pathogenesis. De novo assembly of unmatched reads from non-coding DNA revealed peculiar copy-number variations defining specific UM subtypes, which in turn could be associated with metastatic transformation. Mutational-driven comparison with other tumor types showed that UM is very similar to pediatric tumors, characterized by very few somatic insults and, possibly, important epigenetic changes. Through the analysis of whole-genome sequencing data, our findings shed new light on the molecular genetics of uveal melanoma, delineating it as an atypical tumor of the adult for which somatic events other than mutations in exonic DNA shape its genetic landscape and define its metastatic potential...|$|R
40|$|Most cancer DNA {{sequencing}} {{studies have}} prioritized <b>recurrent</b> non-synonymous <b>coding</b> mutations {{in order to}} identify novel cancer-related mutations. Although attention is increasingly being paid to mutations in non-coding regions, standard approaches to identifying significant mutations may not be appropriate and there has been limited analysis of mutational clusters in functionally annotated non-coding regions. We sought to identify clustered somatic mutations (hotspot regions across samples) in functionally annotated regions in melanoma and other cutaneous malignancies (cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and Merkel cell carcinoma). Sliding window analyses revealed numerous recurrent clustered hotspot mutations in proximal promoters, with some specific clusters present in up to 25 % of cases. Mutations in melanoma were clustered within ETS and Sp 1 transcription factor binding motifs, had a UV signature and were identified in other cutaneous malignancies. Clinicopathologic correlation and mutation analysis support a causal role for chronic UV irradiation generating somatic mutations in transcription factor binding motifs of proximal promoters.

40|$|Context: Inheritance is the {{cornerstone}} of object-oriented development, supporting conceptual modeling, subtype polymorphism and software reuse. But inheritance can be used in subtle ways that make complex systems hard to understand and extend, due to the presence of implicit dependencies in the inheritance hierarchy. Objective: Although these dependencies often specify well-known schemas (i. e., <b>recurrent</b> design or <b>coding</b> patterns, such as hook and template methods), new unanticipated dependency schemas arise in practice, and can consequently be hard to recognize and detect. Thus, a developer making changes or extensions to an object-oriented system needs to understand these implicit contracts defined by the dependencies between a class and its subclasses, or risk that seemingly innocuous changes break them. Method: To tackle this problem, we have developed an approach based on Formal Concept Analysis. Our FoCARE methodology (Formal Concept Analysis based-Reverse Engineering) identifies undocumented hierarchical dependencies in a hierarchy by taking into account the existing structure and behavior of classes and subclasses.

Here we report analysis of whole-genome sequences from cutaneous, acral and mucosal subtypes of melanoma. The heavily mutated landscape of coding and non-coding mutations in cutaneous melanoma resolved novel signatures of mutagenesis attributable to ultraviolet radiation. However, acral and mucosal melanomas were dominated by structural changes and mutation signatures of unknown aetiology, not previously identified in melanoma. The number of genes affected by recurrent mutations disrupting non-coding sequences {{was similar to that}} affected by <b>recurrent</b> mutations to <b>coding</b> sequences. Significantly mutated genes included BRAF, CDKN 2 A, NRAS and TP 53 in cutaneous melanoma, BRAF, NRAS and NF 1 in acral melanoma and SF 3 B 1 in mucosal melanoma. Mutations affecting the TERT promoter were the most frequent of all; however, neither they nor ATRX mutations, which correlate with alternative telomere lengthening, were associated with greater telomere length. Most melanomas had potentially actionable mutations, most in components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositol kinase pathways. The whole-genome mutation landscape of melanoma reveals diverse carcinogenic processes across its subtypes, some unrelated to sun exposure, and extends potential involvement of the non-coding genome in its pathogenesis...|$|R

But artificial intelligence (AI), or more simply, intelligence, is one of a small number of topics over which we seem to be worse than ignorant.

40|$|Several {{candidate}} neural codes {{have been}} proposed to convey sensory information, from spike count to spike patterns, to the timing of spikes relative to oscillations in the Local Field Potential (LFP). Recent experimental studies compared the information content of different codes in V 1 [1] and A 1 [2]. A code combining the spike count and the phase of firing relative to the low frequency component of the LFP contained more information than spike count [1, 2] and displayed also a higher robustness to noise [2]. Spike patterns also conveyed more information than the spike count over the same window [2]. An interesting question regards the mechanisms underlying the generation of such robust temporal codes. Here, we investigated to which extent randomly and sparsely connected recurrent networks of integrate-and-fire neurons [3] subject to naturalistic external stimulation [4] can generate precise and robust temporal codes. We injected the network with inputs built from multi-unit recordings in the LGN of anesthetized monkeys presented with naturalistic movies [4]. As in [2], we divided the recording time into windows and we computed the information content of i) the window spike count; ii) the window spike count combined with its phase relative to the low frequency component of the LFP; iii) the spike patterns obtained dividing the windows into bins of 4 – 8 ms; iv) the spike patterns combined with the phase. We found that spike patterns of 3 – 4 bins conveyed up to 20 more information than spike count, that adding the phase of firing to the spike count increased information up to 100, and {{that the combination of}} the two codes produced a further increase in the information content. Results are qualitatively similar to what was found in experimental recordings, suggesting that such temporal codes can be generated {{even in the absence of}} a particular network architecture. The robustness of these codes was then tested against different kinds of noise. When the inputs were injected with jitters of several ms, the information content of spike patterns decreased sharply while the phase of firing code was more robust than the spike count code. Conversely, spike pattern information was less affected than phase information by increases in the amplitude of the external noise. In <b>recurrent</b> networks, <b>codes</b> involving both spike patterns and phase of firing with respect to low frequency components of the LFP appear therefore to be both significantly more informative than simpler spike count codes and more robust to noise...|$|R

This study aimed to understand the financial and social cost of adherence of non-national TB patients in Cairo, Egypt {{as a means to}} inform the development of context-specific interventions to support treatment adherence. In 2011, 22 in-depth interviews were conducted with TB patients from Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Djibouti to obtain qualitative data. Analysis was based on thematic analysis that aimed to identify <b>recurrent</b> themes and <b>codes</b> from the narratives. The study identified a number of factors that influence TB treatment adherence. Uncertain financial status due to limited or no employment was frequently discussed in interviews, which resulted in fear {{of not being able to}} support family, loss of pride, dependence on family and friends, fear of losing housing, food insecurity and limited food options. Respondents also feared infecting other household members and longed for opportunities to discuss their illness and treatment experiences with other individuals but their social networks were often limited. TB-related stigma was driven by shame and blame of infection. Respondents also believed stigma was based on their foreign origin. Stigma manifested in distancing and exclusion in various ways, resulting in isolation, psychological distress and reluctance to disclose TB status to others. Poverty-related factors and social context with a special focus on stigma should be considered when developing strategies for supporting long-term treatment courses for non-national patients in Cairo and other similar urban settings.

We have previously described our teacher training (TT) program for medical students. The TT program is delivered face-to-face across two sessions. In order to alleviate academic teaching load required to run the course, {{and at the same}} time provide our final-year students with practical opportunities to develop their leadership skills, we engaged five senior students as co-facilitators alongside academic staff. By developing an understanding of our students&# 39; motivation to participate as facilitators, we may be able to promote an interest within leadership in teaching among other students. Our study sought to examine students&# 39; motivation to take part as facilitators in the TT program. Methods: Data were collected through a focus group session with the five student facilitators. Self-determination theory, which poses that there are three elements key to intrinsic motivation, including autonomy, competence, and relatedness, was used as a conceptual lens to identify and <b>code</b> <b>recurrent</b> themes in the data. Results: Elements that motivated students to assist in facilitation included an opportunity to review and build on their knowledge and skills in teaching practices; the recognition and acknowledgement received from school staff and fellow students; the opportunity to develop these relationships; and a desire to increase their peer-teaching responsibilities.

Most studies of influenza wt and HYRs {{have focused on the}} HA gene. The main objective of this study is the identification of the molecular signature in all eight gene segments of influenza A HYR candidate vaccine seeds associated with high growth in ovo. MethodologyThe genomes of 14 wt parental viruses, 23 HYRs (5 H 1 N 1; 2, 1976 H 1 N 1 -SOIV; 2, 2009 H 1 N 1 pdm; 2 H 2 N 2 and 12 H 3 N 2) and PR 8 were sequenced using the high-throughput sequencing pipeline with big dye terminator chemistry. ResultsSilent and coding mutations were found in all internal genes derived from PR 8 {{with the exception of the}} M gene. The M gene derived from PR 8 was invariant in all 23 HYRs underlining the critical role of PR 8 M in high yield phenotype. None of the wt virus derived internal genes had any silent change(s) except the PB 1 gene in X- 157. The highest number of <b>recurrent</b> silent and <b>coding</b> mutations was found in NS. With respect to the surface antigens, the majority of HYRs had coding mutations in HA; only 2 HYRs had coding mutations in NA.
