40|$|Abstract: A {{renewable}} energy source {{plays an important role}} in electricity generation. Various {{renewable energy}} sources like wind, solar, geothermal, ocean thermal, and biomass can be used for generation of electricity and for meeting our daily energy needs. Energy from the sun is the best option for electricity generation as it is available everywhere and is free to harness. On an average the sunshine hour in India is about 6 hrs annually also the sun shine shines in India for about 9 months in a year. Electricity from the sun can be generated through the solar photovoltaic modules (SPV). The SPV comes in various power output to meet the load requirement [1]. Maximization of power from a solar photo voltaic module (SPV) is of special interest as the efficiency of the SPV module is very low. A peak power tracker and DC-DC Boost Converter is used for Extracting the maximum power from the SPV module. And simulation in PSIM software and hardware result is compare and solar panel maximum efficiencies is increase nearby 85 % using dither <b>routine</b> <b>algorithm</b> method use...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Ethiopian {{coffee beans}} are {{distinct}} {{from each other}} in terms of quality based on their geographic origins. The quality of export coffee beans is usually determined by visual inspection, which is subjective, laborious, and prone to error. This calls for the development of an alternative method that is accurate and objective. This research was conducted with the objective of developing an appropriate computer <b>routine</b> <b>algorithm</b> that can characterize coffee beans drawn from four coffee growing regions in the country. Imaging techniques were employed to automatically classify the coffee bean samples according to provenance in Ethiopia (Hararghe, Jimma, Wollega and Yirgacheffe) which corresponds to their botanical origins. Important coffee bean features, namely, colour, morphology and texture were extracted from 160 images (40 images from each location). For the purpose of classification, altogether 29 features (11 colours, 6 morphological and 12 textural features) were extracted from images of the coffee samples from the four locations. Artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to automatically categorize the coffee beans according to their provenance. Four classification setups (1, 2, 3 and 4) were employed based on the features used for colour, morphology, texture, and combination of morphology and colour respectively. Out of 80 sample images, 70 % (56), 25 % (20) and 5 % (4) were used for training, testing, and validating, respectively. Classification scores of 95 %, 100 %, 87. 5 % and 100 % were achieve...|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands, {{clinical}} {{isolation of}} nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) has {{increased over the}} past decade. Proper identification of isolates is important, as NTM species differ strongly in clinical relevance. Most of the currently applied identification methods cannot distinguish between all different Mycobacterium species and complexes within species. rpoB gene sequencing exhibits a promising level of discrimination among rapidly and slowly growing mycobacteria, including the Mycobacterium avium complex. In this study, we prospectively compared rpoB gene sequencing with our <b>routine</b> <b>algorithm</b> of reverse line blot identification combined with partial 16 S rRNA gene sequencing of 455 NTM isolates. rpoB gene sequencing identified 403 isolates to species level as 45 different known species and identified 44 isolates to complex level, and eight isolates remained unidentifiable to species level. In contrast, our reference reverse line blot assay with adjunctive 16 S rRNA gene sequencing identified 390 isolates to species level (30 distinct species) and identified 56 isolates to complex level, and nine isolates remained unidentified. The higher discriminatory power of rpoB gene sequencing results largely from the distinction of separate species within complexes and subspecies. Also, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium kansasii, and Mycobacterium interjectum were separated into multiple groupings with relatively low sequence similarity (98 to 94 %), suggesting that these are complexes of closely related species. We conclude that rpoB gene sequencing is a more discriminative identification technique than the combination of reverse line blot and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and could introduce a major improvement in clinical care of NTM disease and the research on the epidemiology and clinical relevance of NTM...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—An {{accurate}} and behavioral modeling method of symmet-rical T-tree interconnect network is successfully investigated in this paper. The T-tree network topology understudy is consisted of ele-mentary lumped L-cells formed by series impedance and parallel ad-mittance. It is demonstrated how the input-output signal paths of this single input multiple output (SIMO) tree network {{can be reduced}} to single input single output (SISO) network composed of L-cells in cascade. The literal expressions of the currents, the input impedances and the voltage transfer function of the T-tree electrical interconnect via elementary transfer matrix products are determined. Thus, the exact expression of the multi-level behavioral T-tree transfer function is established. The <b>routine</b> <b>algorithm</b> developed was implemented in Matlab programs. As application of the developed modeling method, the analysis of T-tree topology comprised of different and identical RLC-cells is conducted. To demonstrate the relevance of the model established, lumped RLC T-tree networks with different levels for the microelectronic interconnect application are designed and simulated. The work flow illustrating the guideline for the application of the rou-tine algorithm summarizing the modeling method is proposed. Then, 3 D-microstrip T-tree interconnects with width 0. 1 µm and length 3 mm printed on FR 4 -substrate were considered. As results, a very good agreement between the results from the reduced behavioral model pro-posed and SPICE-computations is found both in frequency- and time-domains by considering arbitrary binary sequence “ 01001100 ” with 2 Gsym/s rate. The model proposed in this paper presents significant benefits in terms of flexibility and very less computation times. It can be used during the design process of the PCB and the microelectronic circuits for the signal integrity prediction. In the continuation of thi...|$|E

30|$|Theory The {{applicability}} and transferability {{of mathematical}} concepts to {{the domain of}} accounting is undisputed and obvious. Seeber (2013, p. 73) argued that {{in a number of}} professions {{it is not possible to}} solve job-specific tasks without applying mathematical <b>routines,</b> <b>algorithms</b> and models. This is also true for accounting: percentages, (inverse) accounting, basic arithmetic and compound interest calculation represent mathematical key concepts that are essential to solving accounting-specific problems. Further, in mathematics lessons students develop problem-solving strategies and model real-world problems in a different language. These abilities are also relevant in accounting (e.g., the so-called “process-oriented accounting approach” calls for modelling inter- and intra-corporate processes and corporate support processes). Quite similarly, Winther (2010, p. 168) argues that procedural knowledge of mathematical situations (= economic numeracy) represents an important aspect of economical literacy, the ability of cultural participation in economic related contexts.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to evaluate the added value of a low-threshold <b>routine</b> thoracic MDCT <b>algorithm</b> compared with a selective MDCT algorithm in adult blunt trauma patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort {{study was conducted in}} 464 consecutive blunt trauma patients who met criteria indicative of severe blunt trauma (66 % male; age range, 16 - 93 years; median injury severity score, 13). After clinical evaluation and conventional radiography of the chest and thoracic spine, all patients underwent routine thoracic MDCT with an IV contrast agent (<b>routine</b> MDCT <b>algorithm).</b> Within this <b>routine</b> MDCT group, a subgroup was prospectively defined with abnormal or inconclusive clinical or conventional radiography evaluation (selective MDCT group). Two investigators determined the type, extent, and clinical impact of additional injuries found on MDCT as compared to conventional radiography for both MDCT groups. RESULTS: Of all 464 patients within the routine MDCT group, 164 patients underwent selective MDCT, which resulted in detection of additional diagnoses compared with conventional radiography in 97 (59 %) patients. The <b>routine</b> MDCT <b>algorithm</b> detected additional diagnoses compared with conventional radiography in 201 of 464 patients (43 %). Compared with the selective MDCT algorithm, this was an absolute increase of 104 of 464 (22 %) extra patients, resulting in a change in patient management in 34 (7 %; 95 % CI, 5 - 9. 7 %), mostly because of additional findings of pulmonary and mediastinal injury.
