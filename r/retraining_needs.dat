Many of these older workers will re-enter the full-time work force in new areas or will transition into pools of contingent workers. Recent changes in labor law will also help keep older workers in the work place longer. The combination of these factors creates a situation where understanding the training and <b>retraining</b> <b>needs</b> of older workers is critical for continued productivity improvements. This paper summarizes the general state of current knowledge on training older workers, focusing on visual inspection and computer system usage.

Of the 1, 069 Iowa employers contacted, 608 (56. 9 %) responded. According to the respondents, Iowa's system of community college continuing education divisions is indeed responding to business/industry needs for work force training and retraining. The work force training being provided {{was considered to be}} of high quality and flexible and was seen as having a significant impact in meeting the economic and educational needs of Iowa's citizens and businesses. Nearly all respondents reported that substantial proportions of their current work forces need additional training and considered technological change to be an important factor increasing the need for work force training. Of the respondents, 28. 5 % were very familiar with Iowa work force training programs and 61. 5 % were only somewhat familiar with them.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a flexible analytical concept for robust shortest path detection in dynamically reconfigurable graphs. The concept is expressed by {{a mathematical model}} representing the shortest path problem solver. The proposed mathematical model is characterized by three fundamental parameters expressing (a) the graph topology (through the “incidence matrix”), (b) the edge weights (with dynamic external weights’ setting capability), and (c) the dynamic reconfigurability through external input(s) of the source-destination nodes pair. In order to demonstrate the universality of the developed concept, a general algorithm is proposed to determine the three fundamental parameters (of the mathematical model developed) {{for all types of}} graphs regardless of their topology, magnitude, and size. It is demonstrated that the main advantage of the developed concept is that arc costs, the origin-destination pair setting, and the graph topology are dynamically provided by external commands, which are inputs of the shortest path solver model. This enables high flexibility and full reconfigurability of the developed concept, without any <b>retraining</b> <b>need.</b> To validate the concept developed, benchmarking is performed leading to a comparison of its performance with the performances of two well-known concepts based on neural networks...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUnilateral spatial neglect (USN) is an {{attention}} {{deficit in the}} contralesional side of space which occurs after a cerebral stroke, mainly located in the right hemisphere. USN patients are disabled in all daily activities. USN is an important negative prognostic factor of functional recovery and of socio-professional reinsertion. Thus, patient rehabilitation is a major challenge. As this deficit has been described in many sensory modalities (including hearing), many sensory and poly-sensory rehabilitation methods have been proposed to USN patients. They are mainly based on visual, tactile modalities and on motor abilities. However, these methods appear to be quite task-specific and difficult to transfer to functional activities. Very few {{studies have focused on}} the hearing modality and even fewer studies have been conducted in music as a way of improving spatial attention. Therefore, more research on such <b>retraining</b> <b>needs</b> is neccessary in order to make reliable conclusions on its efficiency in long-term rehabilitation. Nevertheless, some evidence suggests that music could be a promising tool to enhance spatial attention and to rehabilitate USN patients. In fact, music is a material closely linked to space, involving common anatomical and functional networks. The present paper aims firstly at briefly reviewing the different procedures of sensory retraining proposed in USN, including auditory retraining, and their limits. Secondly, it aims to present the recent scientific evidence that makes music a good candidate for USN patients’ neuro-rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|Malaysia is a fast {{developing}} {{country and to}} support the growth of Malaysia industrial sector Malaysia needs highly skilled workforce. To fulfill this needs Malaysia has developed many vocational and technical training institutes. Currently there are approximately 194 technical-vocational institutions {{and there is a}} plan to increase this number during five next year plan. They are 90 technical schools which provide the vocational course in secondary school level. The Technical and Vocational Education (TVE) in Malaysia started with the enforcement of Razak Report 1956 and Education Ordinance 1957. Other education reports and education memorandum such as Rahman Talib Report and Education Act 1961, Mahathir Report 1979, Cabinet Memorandum 1995, 1998 and 1999 had further sustained the policies, system, curriculum and direction of technical and vocational education. Although the theoretical debate continues, it has been generally that curriculum should be seen as an overall plan for instruction. It consists of a statement of aims and objectives of content in terms of theoretical knowledge, practical skills to be required, attitude towards work and necessary support materials to be used in its presentation. Improving curriculum content has long been regarded as a core-component of TVET. To produce the good quality of TVET in the school level the focus is the teachers those who specialized in their field. Many of teaching staff who were employed possessed necessary technical skills but no had more opportunity to undertake professional training. TVE in Malaysia, {{there is a shortage of}} qualified technical and vocational teachers. Most teachers are recruited directly after they graduated from universities and collages based on their academic qualifications and do not have industrial work experience. At the same time qualified personnel with work experience are not willing to become teachers due to the unattractive salary scheme. This paper is a review of the structure and performance of the TVE teachers in Malaysia. It is consists in development of curriculum, program design, the nature of learning materials and stakeholders involvement. Teacher training in TVE can be defined is the main role in providing the skill to fulfill the school level TVE needs. Retraining is defined as upgrading of existing skill or acquiring a new one. Upgrading skills can be by accelerating – by doing and joining program in other TVET institution or center.

30|$|In {{our current}} design, the {{classifier}} {{is trained in}} a secure location in an offline fashion with only the alert generation happening online. This requires the user to present in a secure location for training purposes, such as in a hospital {{in the presence of}} a medical care provider, before the model being uploaded to the user’s base station. Making this training process an online one is one of our future work. Further, our approach relies on the inter-relationship between ECG and ABP signals to operate. If a patient’s physiology changes over time, the classifier has to adapt as well. This means that the classifier has to be re-trained every so often in order to capture the current state of the patient’s health. One approach is to automate the relearning, based on a schedule. However, choosing the inter-relearning, interval has to be done carefully. Too short an interval would lead to unnecessary relearning and too long an interval would result in increased errors. Determining the optimal classifier retraining frequency for our work is a user-dependent parameter. For relatively healthy users, the <b>retraining</b> <b>need</b> not happen often, while for individual cardiac conditions, the training has to be done more frequently depending upon the actual condition, how acute it is, and any medications they might be taking.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, a fast {{adaptive}} {{neural network}} classifier named FANNC is proposed. FANNC exploits the advantages of both adaptive resonance theory and field theory. It needs only one-pass learning, and achieves not only high predictive accuracy but also fast learning speed. Besides, FANNC has incremental learning ability. When new instances are fed, it does not <b>need</b> <b>retrain</b> the whole training set. Instead, it could learn the knowledge encoded in those instances through slightly adjusting the network topology when necessary, that is, adaptively appending one or two hidden units and corresponding connections to the existing network. This characteristic makes FANNC fit for real-time online learning tasks. Moreover, since the network architecture is adaptively set up, the disadvantage of manually determining the number of hidden units of most feed-forward neural networks is overcome. Benchmark tests show that FANNC is a preferable neural network classifier, which is superior to several other neural algorithms on both predictive accuracy and learning speed...|$|R

The present study was conducted with the objective of studying the effect of peer-led interventions on tobacco use among adolescents. Materials and Methods: Twenty schools were randomly selected and ten schools each were identified as cluster for intervention and control groups. A total of 402 students in intervention group and 422 in control group were studied. Results: About 48 % and 41 % of adolescents were consuming smokeless tobacco in any form in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Prevalence of consumption of smokeless tobacco was significantly high among boys as compared to girls. Pan masala was {{the most common form of}} consumption. After conducting A Stop Smoking in School Trial-like peer-led intervention, a significant reduction in tobacco consumption of any form was observed in the intervention group (48 %– 36 %) during the follow-up (Z = 3. 2, P < 0. 01). A significant reduction in exposure to passive smoking in the intervention group (32 %– 29 %) was also observed.

40|$|Among {{the various}} ranging techniques, Radio Signal Strength (RSS) based {{approaches}} attract intensive research interests {{because of its}} low cost and wide applicability. RSS-based ranging is apt {{to be affected by}} the multipath phenomenon which allows the radio signals to reach the destination through multiple propagation paths. To address this issue, previous works try to profile the environment and refer this profile in run-time. In practical dynamic environments, however, the profile frequently changes and the painful <b>retraining</b> is <b>needed.</b> Rather than such static ways of profiling the environments, in this paper, we try to accommodate the environmental dynamics automatically in real-time. The key observation is that given a pair of nodes, the RSS at different spectrum channels will be different. This difference carries the valuable phase information of the radio signals. By analyzing these RSS values, we are able to identify the amplitude of signals solely from the Line-of-Sight (LOS) path. This LOS amplitude is a simple function of the path length (the physical distance). We find that the analysis is a typical non-linear curvature fitting problem that has no general routing algorithms. We prove this problem format is ill-conditioned which has no stable and trustable solutions. To deal with this issue, we further explore the practical considerations for the problem and reform it to a greatly improved conditioning shape. We solve the problem by numerical iterations and implement these ideas in a real-time indoor tracking system called MuD. MuD employs only three TelosB nodes as anchors. The experiment results show that in a dynamic environment where five people move around, the averaged localization error is 1 meter.

One such problem is that of the role of public servants when called before parliamentary committees as witnesses. The current guidelines are mainly advice to public servants as to how they should avoid or defer questions which neither the Minister nor the head of the department has authorised them to answer. Of course, this is useful and proper within its limits. However, it fails to address many of the dilemmas and career-threatening choices which can face public servants who find themselves being questioned in an aggressive, hostile manner by members of a parliamentary committee. Unfair treatment of witnesses is not a trivial matter and there are more than isolated instances.

Their policy choices {{are rooted in the}} historical and institutional paths of their political economies. In this paper the author compares defense restructuring and its effects on workers through an analysis of policies in Sweden and the United States. Both the United States and Sweden have maintained strong military and defense sectors, for different reasons, but demonstrate most-different systems design with regard to labor policies affecting a dislocated workforce. It is argued that the dominant 'warfare' state policies of the United States forced the country to develop a set of reactive policies to defense restructuring, more focused on technology and existing defense firms than on the <b>retraining</b> and reemployment <b>needs</b> of its former defense workforce. Sweden's welfare state model, by contrast, enabled defense-sector dislocations to be treated {{in the same way as}} other industrial restructuring in the past, by a set of well-developed labor and social policies that encouraged retraining and reemployment of workers. Case studies from both nations highlight these differences.

40|$|One may ask, “What is tenure {{today with}} its fuzzy parameters? ” Is it a {{property}} right that {{a faculty member}} may earn and “hold ” to retain employment? To understand the issue, educators must first understand what they are tenured to. Since the tenure process emanates from a department, are they tenured to a department or to a college or to the university? Although professors understand that tenure status is not automatically transferred to another institution but must be earned or negotiated again if the professor changes institutions, they often never ask what they are tenured to. This vital question may be their demise. Institutions that tenure faculty to departments or colleges versus the university itself, may simply dismiss all tenured faculty by eliminating or restructuring the department or college. Collaborative administrators accomplish this through established processes and procedures often involving program review to establish productivity and programmatic need. Procedures for this can encompass programmatic self-study reports and faculty review committees including the Academic Senate. If groups of tenured faculty are removed from their positions through this process, benevolent administrators may offer options for the faculty such as funds for <b>retraining</b> personnel for <b>needed</b> positions {{in other areas of}} the university. Retraining offers no guarantees since tenured faculty who have lost their positions must compete for other positions; they need to interview, and, if hired, again seek the tenure track regulations to regain tenure in a new department or college.

At an average 75 months' follow-up (24 - 153), five patients were lost to follow-up. Radiocarpal arthrodesis was performed in one patient 10 years after the PRC. In the 17 remaining patients (18 wrists), pain (VAS) averaged 2. 2, with residual pain of 5. Flexion-extension range was similar to preoperative levels (67 % of contralateral wrist). Wrist strength was decreased by 34 % compared to preoperative. The QuickDASH score averaged 26 points and the PRWE 20 points. Radiocapitate distance decreased by 0. 3 mm on average with joint line narrowing in 6 patients. The carpal translation index was 0. 33 mm, which was unchanged relative to preoperative values. Three patients had work-related limitations that required retraining and one patient had to be reassigned. PRC preserved the preoperative range of motion and reduced pain levels. However, significant loss of strength was observed, resulting in 23 % of manual workers <b>needing</b> <b>retraining</b> or reassignment...|$|R
40|$|Focal hand {{dystonia}} (FHD) in musicians is a painless task-specific motor disorder {{characterized by}} an involuntary loss of control of individual finger movements. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of an innovative behavioural therapy intervention, aimed at normalising movement patterns, in musicians affected by FHD. METHODS: Eight musicians volunteered to take part in this retraining protocol. Intensive constraint-induced therapy and motor control retraining at slow speed were the interventions. Video recordings of the subjects playing two pieces were used for data analysis. The Frequency of Abnormal Movements scale (FAM), the change in metronome speed achieved during motor control retraining, and two ordinal dystonia evaluation scales were chosen as outcome measures. It was hypothesised that there would be significant differences in the FAM scores and metronome speeds over a 12 -month period. ESULTS: For the main outcome measure, the FAM scale scores, the two-factor repeated measures ANOVA revealed a very significant decrease in the number of abnormal movements per second of instrumental playing over the 12 -month period (F = 6. 32, df = 7, p &# 60; 0. 001). Tukey's post-hoc tests carried out for the FAM scores revealed that significant changes occurred after 8 months of therapy. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that a combination of constraint-induced therapy and specific motor control retraining may be a successful strategy for the treatment of musicians' FHD. Furthermore, the results suggest that <b>retraining</b> strategies may <b>need</b> to be carried out for at least 8 months before statistically significant changes are noted. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In late-diagnosed {{transposition}} of {{the great}} arteries (TGA), the left ventricle (LV) involutes as it pumps against low resistance and <b>needs</b> <b>retraining</b> by applying a pulmonary artery band (PAB) in preparation for an arterial switch operation. We report our experience with a telemetrically adaptable band compared with classic banding. METHODS: Ten patients underwent retraining of the LV, 4 patients with an adaptable band and progressive weekly tightening of the band (group 1) and 6 patients with a traditional band (group 2). RESULTS: Mean weight and age at pulmonary band placement was 5. 8 ± 2. 36 kg and 11. 7 ± 11. 1 months for group 1 and 5. 0 ± 2. 3 kg and 6. 4 ± 7. 6 months for group 2. Time between palliation and switch procedure was 4. 2 months in both groups. Group 1 showed an initial mean pulmonary gradient of 25. 5 ± 4. 43 mm Hg with a 5 % closure of the device. The mean gradient increased with progressive closure to 63. 5 ± 9. 8 mm Hg {{at the time of}} the arterial switch operation. There were no reinterventions or deaths in this group. In group 2, the mean pulmonary gradient increased with growth from 49 ± 21. 4 mm Hg to 68. 4 ± 7. 86 mm Hg {{at the time of the}} switch procedure. However, 4 of these patients required reoperations during retraining: 2 needed 1 reoperation and 2 needed 2 reoperations. Two patients died- 1 after banding and 1 after the switch operation. CONCLUSIONS: Retraining of the LV by the adaptable device allows precise control of the tightening, avoids repetitive operations, and diminishes morbidity...|$|R
40|$|Focal hand {{dystonia}} (FHD) in musicians is a painless, task-specific motor disorder {{characterized by}} involuntary {{loss of control}} of individual finger movements. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the long-term effects of a combined behavioral therapy intervention aimed at normalizing finger movement patterns. Methods: Eight musicians with FHD had taken part in the 1 -year study involving intensive constraint-induced therapy and motor control retraining at slow speed as the interventions. Four of these subjects volunteered to take part in this 4 -year follow-up. A quasi-experimental, repeated measures design was used, with 9 testing sessions over 4 years. Video recordings of the subjects playing two pieces were used for data analysis. The Frequency of Abnormal Movements scale (FAM) was the main outcome measure. It was hypothesized that there would be significant differences in FAM scores achieved over the 4 -year period. Results: The results from the ANOVA revealed a significant decrease, by approximately 80 %, in the number of abnormal movements for both pieces over the 4 -year period (F= 7. 85, df= 8, p&# 60; 0. 001). Tukey's post-hoc test revealed that significant improvements occurred after 6 months of therapy (p-values between p&# 60; 0. 001 and p= 0. 044). Although the results were not significant between month 12 and follow-up at year 4, the trend revealed that the progress achieved during the first year of intensive retraining was maintained at year 4. Conclusions: A 1 -year period of intensive task-specific retraining may be a successful strategy with long-term, lasting effects for the treatment of musician's FHD. Results suggest that <b>retraining</b> strategies may <b>need</b> to be carried out for at least 6 months before statistically significant changes are noted...|$|R
