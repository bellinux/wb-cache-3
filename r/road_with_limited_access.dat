50|$|The Swedish road type motortrafikled is a <b>road</b> <b>with</b> <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> (all grade-separated, no slow traffic) and two {{or three}} lanes. According to the EU's {{multilingual}} term base, motortrafikled should be translated to expressway, rapid road or <b>road</b> <b>with</b> <b>limited</b> <b>access.</b> The same rules apply to a motortrafikled as to a motorway - it is basically a half motorway. The speed limit is usually 90 - 100 km/h. Many motortrafikleder are built as 2+1 roads, alternating two lanes in one direction and one in the other, with a narrow fence in between.|$|E

50|$|In 2001 the Cambridge-Huntingdon Multi-Modal Study (CHUMMS) {{recommended}} {{widening of}} the A14 road {{and building a}} guided busway along the old Cambridge and Huntingdon railway,which had been closed to passengers since 1970 and to all traffic since 1993. Since closure there had been proposals to reinstate the rail service, and for a light railway network, a bus lane, a <b>road</b> <b>with</b> <b>limited</b> <b>access,</b> a bus-way, a cycle path and a nature walk. A local group, CAST.IRON, {{was set up in}} July 2003 after being inspired by the Wensleydale Railway to promote and undertake reinstatement of the route for trains and to resist other proposals, referring to the guided bus as the 'misguided bus'. A private consortium that had proposed a guided bus scheme, SuperCAM, abandoned their plans in 2003. Arup prepared the Transport and Works Act (TWA) application presented in late 2003.|$|E

40|$|The Transport Research Center (AVV) of the Directorate General for Public Works and Water Management {{commissioned}} the SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research {{to carry out}} speed measurements on 80 and 100 km/h roads in twelve Dutch provinces. These measurements were executed in the year 1994. The first series of measurements was completed in 1992. The SWOV's design of the network of measuring spots {{was used for the}} selection of measuring spots. The measurements were carried out on seven road types outside built-up areas. Mobile radar systems were used. The results of the three most important road types are: (1) <b>Roads</b> <b>with</b> <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> and a 100 km/h speed limit show an average speed of 86 km/h, and a speed violation of 18 %; (2) other important <b>roads</b> <b>with</b> a 80 km/h speed limit show an average speed of 76 km/h, and a speed violation of 35 %; and (3) roads narrower than 5 meter and with a 80 km/h speed limit show an average speed of 71 km/h, and a speed violation of 25 %. The results of the measurements provide both a country wide representative and a regional indicative image of the driving speeds. The report also shows a decrease of the average speed level in 1994 compared to the level in 1992. See also C 1976 (IRRD 860653) and C 7530 a+b (IRRD 890084) ...|$|R
