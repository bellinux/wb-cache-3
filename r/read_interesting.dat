[...] "It'd {{be easier for}} people to <b>read</b> <b>Interesting</b> Times, than sum it up, but I would say that one of things I wanted to develop in the story was the strange way in which revolutions can turn into tyrannies. People struggle to over-throw tyrants, then suddenly find that they're ruled by [...] "The Government" [...] once again - and popular uprisings don't stop often to ask common people what it is they need." ...|$|E

40|$|What one discovers, upon {{reviewing}} {{the case of}} Maria White Lowell, is that a mid-nineteenth-century white woman of intelligence and talent might, under certain circumstances, <b>read</b> <b>interesting</b> books, have a good marriage, write original poems, publish, give birth, and continue to prosper creatively. Her biography brings into focus {{the limits of the}} theory that all nineteenth-century women were rendered miserable and mute by the pressures of patriarchy. But Lowell 2 ̆ 7 s case cannot be generalized, since her relationship with her husband was extraordinary for any time, and her life, cut short by tuberculosis when the poet was only 32, was too brief to yield clear evidence of more than partial exemption...|$|E

In the theoretical section, {{you can find the}} distribution of types of wastewater, treatment methods and reduction of wastewater. In the chapter "Types of wastewater" I show the distribution of wastewater to the sewage water, precipitation water, ballast water and industrial water. Another chapter is very comprehensive, "Methods of wastewater treatment. " Here I have set out the division between intensive and extensive, and then also wastewater to the more classic distribution to the mechanical, chemical and biological. You can <b>read</b> <b>interesting</b> information about the root sewage treatment. In the practical part, I propose three research workers oriented attemps, didactic cards for teachers and pupils, as well as excursions to the sawage treatment in Bubeneč.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this project {{was to develop a}} series of {{learning}} activities correlated to reading. The activities are intended to be used by students in grades two, three, and four.

The development and preparation of this reading resource center has been an ongoing type of activity with ideas written down and incorporated into daily teaching. Many ideas and techniques were acquired from co-workers and related literature. Games have an appeal to children. They offer interesting approaches to learning the basic skills in reading. The competition involved in many of these instructional games encourages children to put forth more effort. An enthusiastic teacher with the right attitude and good instructional games could be the key to student success. This reading resource center is available to interested teachers at Westside School, Mauston, Wisconsin...|$|R
5000|$|The Input Hypothesis, {{proposed}} by Dr. Stephen Krashen, suggests that language {{development is a}} function of the input received by the learner. Krashen asserts that there are two distinct ways of learning language: language [...] "learning" [...] and language [...] "acquisition". Language [...] "learning" [...] is learning that takes conscious effort on the part of the learner. It is characterized by learning grammar rules, memorizing vocabulary lists, and performing speaking drills. Language [...] "acquisition" [...] is learning that is subconscious and takes little or no effort on the part of the learner. It is characterized by listening and understanding to messages, <b>reading</b> <b>interesting</b> books and articles, and other enjoyable activities that take place in the language being learned. According to Krashen's theory, the only thing that can lead to fluency in the language is language [...] "acquisition". Language [...] "learning" [...] can only be used as a way to consciously edit speech or writing, and it is never the cause of spontaneous, unrehearsed speech or writing.|$|R
