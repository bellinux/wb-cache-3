Congress gave Roosevelt the authority to <b>raise</b> <b>up</b> to four divisions similar to the Rough Riders of 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry Regiment and to the British Army 25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers; however, as Commander-in-chief, President Woodrow Wilson refused to make use of Roosevelt's volunteers.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. What {{it was for}} Jesus to be <b>raised</b> <b>up</b> unto them. This word 'raised up' is {{diversely}} {{taken in}} the Scripture. (1.) It is taken for 'sending'; as when he saith he <b>raised</b> them <b>up</b> judges, saviours, and prophets, he means he sent them such, and thus he <b>raised</b> <b>up</b> Jesus--that is, 'he sent him' (Judg 2:16,18, 3:9,15; Amos 2:11). 'I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, {{he gave me a}} commandment' (John 12:49). (2.) To be <b>raised</b> <b>up,</b> intimateth one invested with power and authority. Thus he <b>raised</b> <b>up</b> David to be the king of Israel, he anointed him and invested him with kingly power (1 Sam 16:13; Acts 13:22). And thus was Jesus Christ <b>raised</b> <b>up.</b> Hence he is called 'the horn of salvation'--'He hath <b>raised</b> <b>up</b> an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David' (Luke 1:69). (3.) To be <b>raised</b> <b>up,</b> intimateth quickening and strengthening, to oppose and overcome all opposition. Thus was Jesus <b>raised</b> <b>up</b> from under sin, death, the rage of the world, and hell, that day that God raised him out of the grave.|$|R

5|$|Incubation lasts {{thirteen}} days, {{although the}} last egg laid may take 24hours {{longer than the}} first to hatch. Both parents share the responsibility of brooding the eggs, but the female spends more time incubating them than does the male, {{and is the only}} parent to do so at night when the male returns to the communal roost. The young are born blind and naked. They develop light fluffy down within seven days of hatching and can see within nine days. Once the chicks are able to regulate their body temperature, about six days after hatching, the adults largely cease removing droppings from the nest. Prior to that, the fouling would wet both the chicks' plumage and the nest material, thereby reducing their effectiveness as insulation and increasing the risk of chilling the hatchlings. Nestlings remain in the nest for three weeks, where they are fed continuously by both parents. Fledglings continue to be fed by their parents for another one or two weeks. A pair can <b>raise</b> <b>up</b> to three broods per year, frequently reusing and relining the same nest, although two broods is typical, or just one north of 48°N. Within two months, most juveniles will have moulted and gained their first basic plumage. They acquire their adult plumage the following year. As with other passerines, the nest is kept clean and the chicks' faecal sacs are removed by the adults.|$|E

Realizing the danger posed by the Mongols, the rulers of Mosul and Cilician Armenia submitted to the Great Khan. Chormaqan divided the Transcaucasia region into three districts based on the Mongol military hierarchy. In Georgia, the population was temporarily divided into eight tumens. By 1237 the Mongol Empire had subjugated most of Persia (including modern-day Azerbaijan), Armenia, Georgia (excluding Abbasid Iraq and Ismaili strongholds), as well as all of Afghanistan and Kashmir. After the battle of Köse Dağ in 1243, the Mongols under Baiju occupied Anatolia, while the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm and the Empire of Trebizond became vassals of the Mongols. Güyük Khan abolished decrees issued by the Mongol princes that had ordered the raising of revenue from districts in Persia as well as offering tax exemptions to others in c. 1244.|$|E
25|$|No-limit hold 'em {{has grown}} in {{popularity}} and is the form most commonly found in televised tournament poker and is the game played in the main event of the World Series of Poker. In no-limit hold 'em, players may bet or raise any amount over the minimum <b>raise</b> <b>up</b> {{to all of the}} chips the player has at the table (called an all-in bet). The minimum raise is equal {{to the size of the}} previous bet or raise. If someone wishes to re-raise, they must raise at least the amount of the previous raise. For example, if the big blind is $2 and there is a raise of $6 to a total of $8, a re-raise must be at least $6 more for a total of $14. If a raise or re-raise is all-in and does not equal the size of the previous raise (or half the size in some casinos), the initial raiser cannot re-raise again (in case there are other players also still in the game). In pot-limit hold 'em, the maximum raise is the current size of the pot (including the amount needed to call).|$|E

25|$|The {{morning of}} 25 September 1598 the armies clashed {{in a major}} {{engagement}} at the Battle of Stångebro. Charles offered talks again but attacked in a mist while Sigismund's men were withdrawing to their camp, which resulted in only the mercenaries fighting since his Swedes refused to fight. Duke Charles won a decisive victory that forced Sigismund to agree to harsh terms. Charles demanded that the King send home his entire army but that he himself was to stay and await a Parliament. Also, a number of Swedes who had sided with Sigismund, including his Council supporters, were captured. These were later executed in the Linköping Bloodbath of 1600. The peace agreement was sealed with a dinner between Charles and Sigismund at Linköping Castle. The King, who was under pressure, fearing for his life without his army and having realised {{that he had lost}} the political battle, fled during the coming days to Poland in late 1598. At {{the same time as the}} peace treaty was being signed in Linköping, conflicts were taking place in Dalarna.
