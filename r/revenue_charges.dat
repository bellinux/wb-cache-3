40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if hospital ownership has an effect on economic factors and quality outcomes related to inpatient substance abuse treatment. The study examines these factors through analyzing the effect of ownership on length of stay and total <b>revenue</b> <b>charges</b> for inpatient substance abuse treatment provided at hospitals in Florida. Hospital inpatient data were collected from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. Two multiple regression models were used to compare the effect of ownership, along with other patient factors, on length of stay and total <b>revenue</b> <b>charges.</b> Overall, three key conclusions were made. First, for-profit hospitals charged substance abuse patients more for inpatient care than non-profit hospitals. Second, patients treated in for-profit general hospitals stayed fewer days and received higher charges than patients treated in non-profit general hospitals. Lastly, Medicare patients stayed more days and received higher charges than patients with other types of payers in both facilities, but this trend was stronger in for-profit hospitals. This study concludes that, while hospital ownership results in economic differences in care, the measure of quality of care is inconclusive. It is important that further information is collected to understand the difference in the quality of care provided at non-profit and for-profit hospitals...|$|E
40|$|Clearance of {{commercial}} import consignments {{can be arranged}} by an appointed Customs broker (agent) or by the owner. Private importers who wish to clear their own goods should contact the nearest Customs Service offi ce for advice on requirements and operating hours. ISSN 1175 - 396 X Why do I need a Customs clearance for imported goods? All imported goods arriving in New Zealand are {{required by law to}} be cleared through the New Zealand Customs Service. Imported goods are subject to security requirements and the payment of import duty and GST charges. Customs undertakes security screening and collects <b>revenue</b> <b>charges</b> on behalf of the New Zealand Government. What is a Customs clearance? A Customs import clearance refers to the procedure where the importer of the goods is required to lodge an electronic declaration (import entry) covering the particulars of their imported goods, the payment of any <b>revenue</b> <b>charges</b> due and subsequent formal release of those goods by Customs. What is the procedure for clearing commercial import consignments? An electronic entry must be lodged, either over the Internet at www. customsentry. govt. nz, or using EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) software. In some cases, importers may also be asked to provide additional information such as: • An airwaybill or bill of lading. • Invoices. • Other documents, such as packing lists, or insurance certificates. Importers may also need to contact shipping companies, airlines or freight forwarders for advice on their requirements, operating hours and/or location of the goods. How do I lodge a Customs import entry? Import entries may be lodged over the Internet or via EDI. Many importers use their freight forwarder or a Customs broker to lodge import clearances on their behalf, as they generally already have EDI software, and are familiar with Customs legal requirements. Using EDI EDI users are required to: • Develop or purchase EDI software which contains features necessary to transmit clearance messages and receive responses. • Test proper functionality with Customs prior to use. • Pay for the EDI link and associated messaging costs. Thus EDI is generally more suitable for higher-frequency users. For further information on EDI requirements, refer to the Customs website www. customs. govt. nz under Exporters/Customs Requirements/Clearance o...|$|E
