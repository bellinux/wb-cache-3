40|$|When The <b>Riddle</b> of the <b>Sands</b> was {{published}} in 1903 it was quick to attract attention. Its plot, concerning a German conspiracy to invade Britain, has been credited by cultural historians with contributing significantly to a public ‘invasion mania’ in the {{years leading up to}} the First World War, which in turn fed the popular appetite for more spy thrillers, breathing life into the fledgling genre. Such assessments of the novel’s influence have tended to focus upon the authenticity of the invasion plot, the history of its subsequent reception and Childers’ presumed sympathy with the militarist opinions of Arthur H. Davies, one of the central protagonists. Connected to this is a common view of The <b>Riddle</b> of the <b>Sands</b> as belonging to a right-wing movement that sought to bolster British imperialism through calls for naval rearmament and the establishment of a secret service. The <b>Riddle</b> of the <b>Sands</b> certainly creates a space for the articulation of such arguments, which Davies does indeed deliver in declamatory fashion. But to identify the overall political sensibility of the novel with such demagoguery is only sustainable if one disregards the ways in which it is mediated by the literary form and tone of narration...|$|R

5000|$|Buffett {{mentions}} that [...] "Burn That Bridge" [...] is off of <b>Riddles</b> in the <b>Sand,</b> to which Michael Utley replies, [...] "That's right!" [...] Buffett {{has been known}} to do a terrific job of playing a variety of all kinds of songs from his catalog whether it be new, old, hits or obscure songs. However, he {{has been known to}} do a bad job at keeping track of which songs appear on which albums, which explains why Utley was impressed. Interestingly, the following song in the setlist, [...] "Knees Of My Heart", is also on <b>Riddles</b> in the <b>Sand.</b> Also, [...] "Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes" [...] and [...] "Tampico Trauma" [...] both appear back-to-back in the setlist and also appear on Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes, and [...] "Volcano" [...] and [...] "Fins" [...] both appear back-to-back in the setlist and are the first two tracks on Volcano (Jimmy Buffett album) (but in reversed order). These are assumed to be a coincidence, but still interesting nevertheless.|$|R

50|$|Erskine Childers' The <b>Riddle</b> of the <b>Sands</b> (1903), is {{an early}} example of spy fiction. A noted writer in the spy novel genre was John le Carré, while in thriller writing, Ian Fleming created the {{character}} James Bond 007 in January 1952, while on holiday at his Jamaican estate, Goldeneye. Fleming chronicled Bond's adventures in twelve novels, including Casino Royale (1953), Live and Let Die (1954), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), Thunderball (1961), and nine short story works.|$|R
500|$|The {{end of the}} 19th {{century and}} {{the first decade of}} the 20th century saw rising anti-German {{sentiment}} in Britain. [...] As the naval arms race between Britain and Germany escalated, distrust of Germans and those of German origin was stirred-up by press warnings of the rising military threat from Germany. This was developed further in popular magazines such as the National Review and in novels such as Erskine Childers' The <b>Riddle</b> of the <b>Sands</b> and invasion novels such as William Le Queux's The Invasion of 1910.|$|R
