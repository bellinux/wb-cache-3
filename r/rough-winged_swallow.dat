50|$|The {{northern}} <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> (Stelgidopteryx serripennis) is a small, migratory swallow. It is {{very similar}} to the southern <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow,</b> Stelgidopteryx ruficollis.|$|E
50|$|The {{mountain}} saw-wing (Psalidoprocne fuliginosa), {{also known}} as the mountain <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> or the Cameroon Mountain <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> is a species of bird in the family Hirundinidae.|$|E
50|$|Southern <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallows</b> forage for {{insects in}} flight, usually flying low {{with a slow}} {{deliberate}} flight. The call is an unmusical chirrup.|$|R
50|$|Black <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallows</b> {{are usually}} seen in pairs or small groups hunting for flying insects in {{woodland}} clearings and edges, above forest, or over water. Their flight is weak and fluttering. It {{is a quiet}} species, but it gives a soft chrrp alarm call. There is also a contact call described for as chirr chirr cheeeu for P. p. holomelaena and tseeu tseu tsss-ip for orientalis.|$|R
50|$|The animal {{population}} includes birds (bald eagles, owls, belted kingfishers, cliff and northern <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallows,</b> seagulls, sandpipers, and herons), mammals (black-tailed deer, mink, harbour seals, otters, bats), reptiles (garter snakes and possibly northern alligator lizard), and numerous invertebrates. Surprisingly, the raccoon is absent; {{its failure to}} become established on the island has allowed ground-nesting birds to maintain their populations. Mink is the only native predatory mammal on land. Many mice as well.|$|R
50|$|The Ridgway's <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> (Stelgidopteryx serripennis ridgwayi) is {{a bird in}} {{the family}} Hirundinidae.It is found in Belize, Guatemala, and Mexico.

50|$|Six {{subspecies}} of {{the northern}} <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> are currently recognized.|$|E
50|$|Located in the Northern Rockies Missoula County has {{a typical}} Rocky Mountain ecology. Local {{wildlife}} includes populations of white-tailed deer, black bears, osprey, and bald eagles. During the winter months, rapid snow melt on Mount Jumbo {{due to its}} steep slope leaves grass available for grazing elk and mule deer. The rivers around Missoula provide nesting habitats for bank <b>swallows,</b> northern <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallows</b> and belted kingfishers. Killdeer and spotted sandpipers can be seen foraging insects along the gravel bars. Other species include song sparrows, catbirds, several species of warblers, and the pileated woodpecker. The rivers also provide cold, clean water for native fish such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The meandering streams also attract beaver and wood ducks.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{subspecies}} of this swallow, which some authorities may split into different species. In particular, four northeastern races, including nominate P. p. pristoptera, have conspicuous white underwing coverts (all other subspecies are green-glossed and have completely dark underwings), {{and may be}} split as the eastern <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> or eastern saw-wing (swallow), P. orientalis. This leaves P. p. holomelaena as the black <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow,</b> P. holomelaena. Other subspecies are also sometimes elevated to species status, but Turner and Rose take the view that all the races of the black <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> are, at best, incipient species.|$|E

50|$|The {{northern}} <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> migrates to the Gulf Coast of the United States {{and south}} to Central America for winter. They {{have also been}} recorded to winter in the Caribbean.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> (Stelgidopteryx ruficollis) {{is a small}} swallow. It {{was first}} formally described as Hirundo ruficollis by French ornithologist Louis Vieillot in 1817 in his Nouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle.|$|E
50|$|The white-headed saw-wing (Psalidoprocne albiceps), {{also known}} as the white-headed <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> is a species of bird in the family Hirundinidae.It is found in Angola, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.|$|E
50|$|They {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to the bank swallow, but have a dusky throat and breast. They are closely related and {{very similar to the}} southern <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow,</b> Stelgidopteryx ruficollis, but that species has a more contrasting rump, and the ranges do not quite overlap.|$|E
50|$|The black <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> {{is a small}} swallow at 13-15 cm length with a forked tail. Its plumage is blue-glossed black. Sexes are similar, but {{the female}} has shorter outer tail feathers, and less obvious wing serrations. Juveniles are brown with little gloss, and have short tails.|$|E
50|$|S. s. stuarti, a {{very dark}} variant of the {{northern}} <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow,</b> was described by Pierce Brodkorb in 1942. It is resident to the southern Mexico lowlands and south to eastern Guatemala. Like the race fulvipennis, it has a slightly buff throat. The under tail coverts also have black tips.|$|E
50|$|The square-tailed saw-wing (Psalidoprocne nitens), {{also known}} as the square-tailed <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> is a species of bird in the family Hirundinidae.It is found in Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.|$|E

50|$|The black <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> breeds in open wooded habitats, {{and has a}} {{preference}} for wetter areas, although some races occur in mountain grassland habitat. It breeds across Africa from eastern Nigeria and Ethiopia south to Angola, northern Zimbabwe and northern Mozambique. The subspecies P. p. holomelaena breeds down south-eastern Africa from southern Mozambique to the Cape in South Africa.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species of}} birds can be seen {{throughout}} the park, including purple gallinule, black-bellied whistling duck, black-crowned night heron, great egret, white ibis, common moorhen, roseate spoonbill,northern flicker, glossy ibis, least bittern, limpkin, mottled duck, northern <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow,</b> northern flicker, and sora. Reptile species include the American alligator and Florida redbelly turtle. Mammals include marsh rabbit, raccoons, bobcats, and the river otter.|$|E
50|$|The {{adult is}} 13.5 cm {{in length and}} weighs 15 g. It is brown above, with blackish wings and tail and a pale grey rump. The throat and upper breast are rufous with the lower underparts yellowish-white. The tail is {{slightly}} forked. It is similar in appearance to its northern counterpart, the northern <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow,</b> but is more uniform in colour, particularly on the rump.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> {{is classified}} as least concern by the IUCN. Although its population is declining, it is not declining fast enough nor is its range small enough to justify a classification of vulnerable. In addition, this species {{is estimated to be}} composed of about 15 million individual birds, so it is not vulnerable under the population size criterion. This swallow has been found to adapt well to humans and sometimes nests in artificial cavities created by them.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> is {{native to}} Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Cayman Islands, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Turks and Caicos Islands, and the United States. They are vagrant to Aruba, Barbados, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, Curaçao, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, and Sint Maarten. The populations in the US and Canada {{have been found to}} winter in the southern-most US and further south. While this is true, the populations in Mexico and further south seem to be non-migratory, although local post-breeding movements do occur. This swallow has been found to occur as high as 2500 m in Costa Rica.|$|E
5000|$|The {{northern}} <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> usually nest near streams, {{lakes and}} river banks across North America. They nest in cavities near water, usually a burrow in dirt; {{they do not}} usually form colonies. While they do prefer riverbanks, they prefer a drier site than the bank swallow that it is often confused with. The burrows they nest in are usually [...]3 - 1.8 m deep. The nests {{at the end of}} the burrows are usually made with twigs, weeds, bark, and are lined with fine grass. Some of these swallows have been recorded to use small drainage pipes or other artificial cavities as nest sites. They usually nest solitarily or in small groups. They seem to frequently nest on the edge of bank swallow colonies.|$|E
50|$|Migratory birds {{found in}} or near the Caja include turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), {{killdeer}} (Charadrius vociferus), loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), common nighthawk (Chordeiles minor), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura, broad-tailed hummingbird (Selasphorus platycercus), ladder-backed woodpecker (Picoides scalaris), downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), American gray flycatcher (Empidonax wrightii), Say's phoebe (Sayornis saya), ash-throated flycatcher (Myiarchus cinerascens), Cassin's kingbird (Tyrannus vociferans), plumbeous vireo (Vireo plumbeus), horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), violet-green swallow (Tachycineta thalassina), northern <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> (Stelgidopteryx serripennis), blue-gray gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), mountain bluebird (Sialia currucoides), Townsend's solitaire (Myadestes townsendi), American robin (Turdus migratorius), American pipit (Anthus rubescens), black-throated gray warbler (Dendroica nigrescens), western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana), chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina), lark sparrow (Chondestes grammacus), western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Waterfowl using the Rio Grande corridor include Canada goose (Branta canadensis), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), northern pintails (Anas acuta), and American wigeon (Anas americana).|$|E
