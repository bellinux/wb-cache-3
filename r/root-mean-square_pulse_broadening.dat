Data were collected with the 305 -m Arecibo telescope at four radio frequencies between 430 and 2380 MHz. We used a CLEAN-based algorithm to deconvolve interstellar <b>pulse</b> <b>broadening</b> from the measured pulse shapes. We employed two distinct <b>pulse</b> <b>broadening</b> functions (PBFs) : PBF 1 {{is appropriate for}} a thin screen of scattering material between the Earth and a pulsar, while PBF 2 is appropriate for scattering material uniformly distributed {{along the line of}} sight from the Earth to a pulsar. We found that some observations were better fit by PBF 1 and some by PBF 2. <b>Pulse</b> <b>broadening</b> times (τd) are derived from fits of PBFs to the data, and are compared with the predictions of a smoothed model of the Galactic electron distribution. Several lines of sight show excess broadening, which we model as clumps of high density scattering material. A global analysis of all available data finds that the <b>pulse</b> <b>broadening</b> scales with frequency, ν, as τd ∝ ν −α where α ∼ 3. 9 ± 0. 2.

40|$|Abstract—Dispersion {{management}} {{is an effective}} technique to suppress the nonlinear impairment in fiber transmission systems, which includes tuning the amounts of precompensation, residual dispersion per span (RDPS), and net residual dispersion (NRD) of the systems. For self-phase modulation (SPM) -limited systems, optimizing the NRD is necessary because it can greatly improve the system performance. In this paper, an analytical method is presented to optimize NRD for SPM-limited dispersion-managed systems. The method {{is based on the}} correlation between the nonlinear impairment and the output <b>pulse</b> <b>broadening</b> of SPM-limited systems; therefore, dispersion-managed systems can be optimized through minimizing the output single-pulse broad-ening. A set of expressions is derived to calculate the output <b>pulse</b> <b>broadening</b> of the SPM-limited dispersion-managed system, from which the analytical result of optimal NRD is obtained.

30|$|In this paper, a novel pulse {{interference}} filter for fiber Bragg grating (FBG) interrogation {{based on the}} tunable Fabry-Perot (F-P) filtering principle is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The self-developed FBG interrogation system is devised for the aircraft health management of key structures. Nevertheless, the pulse interference is detected in the reflection spectrum of FBG causing interrogation system unstable. To address the problem, the first-order lag <b>pulse</b> <b>broadening</b> filter is proposed in this paper. The first-order lag filter is applied to preprocess and smooth the original signal, meanwhile enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Afterwards, peaks of reflection spectrum are distinguished with pulse interference by <b>pulse</b> <b>broadening.</b> Experimental results indicate that 634 peaks are detected before adopting the first-order lag <b>pulse</b> <b>broadening</b> filter. Comparatively, the number of peaks decreases to 203 after filtering the interference pulse, and the correct rate of peak detection is higher than 98.5 %. Through the comparison with the finite impulse response (FIR) filter, the advantage of first-order lag filter is proved. The vibration monitoring experiment demonstrates that this system has high dynamic precision with a dynamic interrogation range of 0 Hz– 400 Hz, and the maximum repetition rate of 800 Hz.|$|R

When combined with Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA), it provides high data transmission rate and low attenuation. But due to fiber non-linearity such as Self Phase Modulation (SPM) and Cross Phase Modulation (XPM) the system performance has degraded. This non-linearity depends on different parameters of an optical system such as channel spacing, power of the channel and length of the fiber section. The degradation can be seen in terms of phase deviation and Bit Error Rate (BER) performance.

This research was based on our own measurements, performed on the observational data and the profiles from various pulsar profile databases, as well as the scatter time measurements that were found in the literature. We were able to construct a database of over 60 pulsars with true multi-frequency α measurements, which allowed us to revise the previously proposed relations between the scatter time spectral slope and the dispersion measure (DM). We found that the deviations from theoretical predictions of the value of α appear for pulsars regardless of their DM, however the DM-averaged value of the scaling index is almost constant except for pulsars with very high DMs. Based on the obtained slopes we were also able to estimate the amount of scattering at the standard frequency of 1 GHz. We found that while the estimated standardized <b>pulse</b> <b>broadening</b> time increases with DM the relation seems to be much flatter than it was previously proposed, which suggests higher values of the scatter time for mid-DM pulsars, and lower values of expected <b>pulse</b> <b>broadening</b> for highly dispersed sources.
