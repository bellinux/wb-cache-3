In 2009, MoDOT calculated that as few as 38,152vehicles traveled along the highway at the northern terminus just north of the interchange with I-70, and as many as 75,647vehicles used the highway just east of the Grandview Triangle.

Most of those riders altered their road race bikes with the aerodynamic handlebars of a time trial bike, but some, including race leader Danilo Di Luca, did not. The climbs in the stage increased the overall chances for strong climbers who are relatively weak time trialists, such as Damiano Cunego and Gilberto Simoni.|$|E

The two routes continued to share a terminus until 1981, when ownership and maintenance of part of NY234 was transferred {{from the state of}} New York to Oneida County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the state acquired a pair of county <b>roads</b> <b>that</b> followed a routing parallel to that of the transferred section of NY234.
