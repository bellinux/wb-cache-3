5|$|Prime Minister Franjo Gregurić advised Tuđman to {{implement}} Špegelj's plan. According to General Anton Tus, Tuđman ordered the ZNG to capture JNA barracks on 12 September, but rescinded the order the next day. The order was reinstated on 14 September after Tus pleaded with Tuđman to re-authorize action, {{arguing that the}} ZNG was <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The same day, the ZNG and the Croatian police blockaded and cut utilities to all JNA facilities it had access to, beginning the Battle of the Barracks. This action comprised blockades of 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia, and numerous smaller facilities, including border posts, and weapons and ammunition storage depots.|$|E
5|$|Scattered {{around each}} level are gold rings. Collecting 100 rings rewards the player {{with an extra}} life. Rings act as a layer of {{protection}} against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, he will survive. However, all rings in his possession will be scattered; they flicker and disappear {{in a few seconds}} if not picked up again. If he is hit without holding any rings, he loses a life. Shields and temporary invincibility can be collected to provide additional layers of protection, but certain hazards, such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> will cause Sonic to lose a life regardless of rings or other protection.|$|E
5|$|Players must guide a {{boy scout}} through a 43-room mansion {{in order to}} obtain 16 keys and a {{combination}} before <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> These unlock a safe containing the pills needed to save the mansion owner's life. It is necessary to jump onto platforms and evade enemies in order to progress. At the start of the game the player has three lives; a life is lost should the boy scout fall too far or come into contact with one of the mansion's servants or traps. Rooms contain doors that can be entered to move around the mansion, as well as push buttons and hazards. Pressing buttons can result in lifts being activated, platforms appearing or in an enemy appearing. One of the mansion's rooms is a corridor of eight doors with a large pair of eyes above them; this room acts as a maze. A tune is played continuously during play, but can be toggled on or off.|$|E

5|$|The writing team {{included}} Nakazawa, {{who wrote}} You's route and the Kid's common route; Nakazawa's assistant Kitaro Sasanari, who wrote Tsugumi and Sora's routes; Nobuaki Umeda; and Uchikoshi, who wrote Coco's route. The writing process for all routes were supervised by Uchikoshi, {{in an effort}} to eliminate inconsistencies in the setting or characters, and plot holes between the different parts of the story. Because he was <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> at the end, he had to rush the writing of the end of Coco's route, which he described as possibly his only regret with the game. Nakazawa wrote his parts in between his directorial work, such as writing specification documents, supervising the production, and doing quality control work; {{due to the lack of}} time, he ended up having to stay overnight at KID everyday and work through the night, something he said was only possible because of how young he was at the time. Nakazawa described himself as working particularly hard on the game because he felt bitter that Never 7 had not sold particularly well.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system remains}} unchanged from Ridge Racer, the checkpoint and time limit system remain the same; <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> ends {{the race and}} passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting is more like Ridge Racer 2. The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission. Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, {{in which there are}} no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available {{at the start of the}} game. Ridge Racer Revolution features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racers courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.|$|E

The move blockaded 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia, and numerous smaller facilities, including border posts and weapons and ammunition storage depots. The blockade forced the JNA to amend its campaign in Croatia plans to accommodate the new development. Several JNA posts were attacked by the ZNG before the blockade was officially sanctioned, largely in response to local battlefield situations. The first such incident was a failed attack on JNA barracks in Sinj on 25 August, {{in response to the}} deterioration of ZNG positions in the nearby village of Kijevo. On 3 September, the ZNG captured a barracks in Sisak, and on 13 September a weapons storage depot in Gospić area was captured amid fighting for control of the city. In May, 21 M-84AB tanks were captured in a Đuro Đaković factory. The tanks were due to be shipped to Kuwait, but a part of the shipment was kept by Croatia. A train transporting JNA weapons from Slovenia to Serbia was captured in Slavonski Brod on 21 August. The ZNG seized its first anti-aircraft weapons, anti-tank weapons, and artillery pieces there while adding to its small stock of mortars. The ZNG forces besieging the JNA facilities were mainly drawn from the local populace; reinforcements deployed from other cities were relatively few.|$|E

The Digital Economy Bill went into what is called wash-up. The wash-up is an accelerated parliamentary process used after {{general election}}s have been called to rush unopposed legislation through parliament before dissolution. This meant it was not debated at length in the Commons. In return for supporting the Digital Economy Bill in the final wash-up vote the Conservatives demanded the removal of Clause 43 which related to orphan works, copyrighted works for which the copyright owner cannot be located, which had been criticised by photographers. Other clauses that were removed during wash-up included provisions for the funding of regional news consortia. The bill received its second reading in the House of Commons on 6 April 2010.|$|R

5000|$|Charles was <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> both <b>time</b> and options. Winter 1708-09 was {{a miserable}} {{one for the}} Swedes encamped in Ukraine, and in the {{following}} spring Charles was bogged down in a siege of the small Russian fortress of Poltava. Peter, still wary of engaging the Swedes in a pitched battle, slowly moved his troops through fortified positions to relieve the small fort. Charles foresaw {{that he could not}} take Poltava in time to avoid the Russians, but was confident that his 25,000 veteran troops, despite dwindling numbers, lack of supplies, and exhaustion, could defeat the 40,000 Russians in battle and finally end the war with Swedish victory. Peter, meanwhile, could afford to be patient; the Swedes were marooned far from support or reinforcements, and were losing numbers every day. The most direct path between the Russian camp to the north and Poltava was through treacherous forest and marsh, and thus Peter foresaw that any Swedish attack would double around the left, heading west before turning north through open ground towards the Russian army. Peter built six earthen redoubts in a line facing this probable Swedish charge, later augmenting them with four more, extending south in a [...] "T".|$|R

40|$|Military force {{projection}} is the self-reliant capacity to strike from mainland ports, bases and airfields to protect Australia’s sovereignty {{as well as}} more distant national interests. Force projection is not just a flex of military muscle in <b>times</b> <b>of</b> emergency or the act of dispatching forces. It is a cycle of force preparation, command, deployment, protection, employment, sustainment, rotation, redeployment and reconstitution.

40|$|Quantum {{computation}} and simulation with {{a complete}} graph of superconducting qubits has been proposed [PRA 91, 062309 (2015) ]. The method does not require error correction and is practical now. By controlling the vertices (qubits) and edges (couplers) appropriately, and working in the single-excitation subspace (SES), a real but otherwise arbitrary nxn Hamiltonian can be directly programmed into the chip. The SES method, however, requires a physical qubit for every basis state in the computer's Hilbert space. This imposes large resource costs for algorithms using registers of ancillary qubits, as each ancilla doubles the required graph size. Here we show how to circumvent this doubling by leaving the SES and reintroducing a tensor product structure in the computational subspace. Specifically, we implement the tensor product of an SES register holding "data" {{with one or more}} ancilla qubits, which are able to independently control arbitrary nxn unitary operations on the data in a constant number of steps. This enables a hybrid form of quantum computation where fast SES operations are performed on the data, traditional logic gates and measurements are performed on the ancillas, and controlled-unitaries act between. As an application we give an ancilla-assisted SES implementation of the quantum linear system solver of Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, and estimate that reasonably accurate symmetric matrix inversions up to dimension 10 would be possible before <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> coherence <b>time...</b>|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} on social exclusion {{has found that}} it has many social and personal consequences, such as disrupting self-regulation, and lowering well-being, self-esteem {{and the need to}} belong. However, authenticity {{is a part of the}} self that has not been studied with respect to social exclusion. The present study aims to investigate whether state authenticity (authenticity that is affected by social environments) is affected by social exclusion, and whether these effects are mediated by trait authenticity, mood, situational self-awareness, or satisfying psychological needs. Participants filled out a personality questionnaire and were given feedback about a future consequence, either being told that they were accident prone, that they would have a future filled with belonging, or that they would end up alone. Following this feedback, participants were given a self-regulation task (a crossword puzzle) Upon completion (either by <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the allotted <b>time</b> or giving up), participants filled out questionnaires on mood, situational self-awareness, satisfying psychological needs, and state authenticity. It was found that social exclusion had no effect on state authenticity.

Therefore, self-regulation had no effect on state authenticity...|$|R
25|$|Cook scored {{his third}} double-century and 28th Test ton (263) against Pakistan in first Test at Abu Dhabi in October 2015 in 836 minutes: the longest innings by an Englishman and 3rd longest of all time, facing 528 balls.
