5000|$|<b>Recoating</b> is {{the process}} of {{restoring}} the primary coating to stripped optical fiber sections after fusion splicing. In the <b>recoating</b> process, the spliced fiber is restored to its original shape and strength, using a recoater. The stripped fiber section is recoated by filling a <b>recoating</b> resin, usually acrylate into transparent moulds. The resin is then cured with UV light. It is often desirable to perform a proof-test after <b>recoating,</b> to ensure that the splice is strong enough to survive handling, packaging and extended use.|$|E
40|$|Hot {{corrosion}} causes {{significant problems}} for both aerospace and power generation industries, where {{the combination of}} high temperature, corrosive gases, and contaminants severely limits component operating lifetimes in gas turbine hot gas streams. Multiple laboratory testing methodologies exist to study this hot corrosion, and these can be affected by a range of variables. This paper investigated the impact of varying deposit <b>recoat</b> cycle length when using the ‘deposit recoat’ testing method. CMSX- 4 samples were exposed to simulated type II (pitting) hot corrosion conditions, with the same overall deposit load (averaged across the total exposure run), but different deposit <b>recoat</b> cycles. Post-exposure, samples underwent dimensional metrology analysis to compare metal loss resulting from different deposit <b>recoat</b> cycle lengths. Results for CMSX- 4 suggest very small differences in corrosion losses, indicating CMSX- 4 hot corrosion datasets obtained from deposit <b>recoat</b> experiments with different deposit <b>recoat</b> cycle lengths can be compared with confidence...|$|R

5000|$|Remanufacturing by <b>recoating</b> of worn engine parts; many engine parts, {{components}} {{are large and}} expensive and {{after a period of}} use become worn. An example of such a part is the engine block, in particular the cylinder engine bores, which must withstand explosions during piston firing. Instead of disposing of large engine blocks, remanufacturing has resulted in re-use of the parts by coating them with plasma transferred wire arc spraying (PTWA) Caterpillar known for manufacturing very large industrial trucks and machinery has started such remanufacturing programs of equipment parts using PTWA, resulting in a greener environment. Remanufacturing by <b>recoating</b> of parts is also very popular in the aircraft field, the geothermal pipe field and the automotive engine field.|$|E
40|$|Mammalian reoviruses, {{prototype}} {{members of}} the Reoviridae family of nonenveloped double-stranded RNA viruses, use at least three proteins—s 1, m 1, and s 3 —to enter host cells. s 1, {{a major determinant of}} cell tropism, mediates viral attachment to cellular receptors. Studies of s 1 functions in reovirus entry have been restricted by the lack of methodologies to produce infectious virions containing engineered mutations in viral proteins. To mitigate this problem, we produced virion-like particles by “recoating ” genome-containing core particles that lacked s 1, m 1, and s 3 with recombinant forms of these proteins in vitro. Image reconstructions from cryoelectron micrographs of the <b>recoated</b> particles revealed that they closely resembled native virions in three-dimensional structure, including features attributable to s 1. The <b>recoated</b> particles bound to and infected cultured cells in a s 1 -dependent manner and were approximately 1 million times as infectious as cores and 0. 5 times as infectious as native virions. Experiments with <b>recoated</b> particles containing recombinant s 1 from either of two different reovirus strains confirmed that differences in cell attachment and infectivity previously observed between those strains are determined by the s 1 protein. Additional experiments showed that <b>recoated</b> particles containing s 1 proteins with engineered mutations can be used to analyze the effects of such mutations on the roles of particle-bound s 1 in infection. The results demonstrate a powerful new syste...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} approach for the thermal design of high-power-fiber laser components is presented. The modular {{structure of the}} model allows adaption to different fiber designs and gives insight into the governing parameters of the heat transport. Furthermore the analysis and analytic optimization of interacting effects of groups of layers is possible with this method and is presented in this work. A previously suggested cooling scheme for a heat load of 120 W/m is analyzed. Applying the analysis to air-clad-fibers is leading to results differing up 40 % from previous works. The FEM-analysis of the cooling of splices shows that the cooling scheme suggested for the active fiber is not sufficient for splices for a fiber resonator in the kW-range. Using a one-dimensional model it can be shown that if {{a small percentage of}} loss in the splice is absorbed inside the <b>recoat,</b> it is necessary to reduce the <b>recoat</b> thickness...|$|R
5000|$|Shark tooth stalactites The shark tooth stalactite {{is broad}} and {{tapering}} in appearance. It may begin {{as a small}} driblet of lava from a semi-solid ceiling, but then grows by accreting layers as successive flows of lava rise and fall in the lava tube, coating and <b>recoating</b> the stalactite with more material. They can vary from a few millimeters to over a meter in length.|$|E
50|$|Recoated splices {{can usually}} be coiled into a tight radius because the recoated fiber section is just as {{flexible}} as the original polymer coating. Recoats are e.g. employed in the assembly of undersea optical fiber cables where high fusion splice strength is already necessitated by stringent reliability requirements. Another reason optical fiber <b>recoating</b> is attractive in submarine communications cabling is that the cross section of recoated fibers matches that of the original fiber.|$|E

50|$|Optical fiber <b>recoating</b> is {{the process}} of {{restoring}} the primary coating to stripped optical fiber sections after fusion splicing. The polymer comprising the recoat is usually similar in composition to the original fiber polymer coating. Nyfors optical fiber recoaters are designed to restore the primary coating on spliced optical fibers with acrylate coatings. Due to the mould design, the restored part of the coating has a diameter and other properties, such as eccentricity and roundness, that are almost identical to the original fiber.|$|E

40|$|A {{sintered}} part’s {{mechanical properties}} are often variable {{dependent on the}} temperature at which it was sintered. Prior research has investigated how predefined process conditions (such as scan speed and laser power) in the ‘Sinter’ software affect built parts, however, little work focuses on other process conditions that can directly affect the temperature distribution in the bed relative to these parts. These conditions are not always controllable in the ‘Sinter’ software. By replacing the scanner {{at the top of}} the Sinterstation 2000 with a thermal imaging camera, an insight into the temperature distribution on the part bed was obtained. A temperature variance of up to 7 °C was found across the bed, as well as a large temperature drop and recovery period on powder layer <b>recoat.</b> This paper explores the possible causes of this variation in the processing of DuraForm™ Polyamide- 12 powder by monitoring and assessing build operations, enabled by replacing the front viewing window with a retro-fitted thermal imaging camera. The part bed was observed and various process conditions analysed including powder <b>recoat,</b> part and feed heaters, and swing gate configuration. On powder <b>recoat,</b> the part bed exhibited a drop in temperature because the fresh layer of powder is at a lower temperature than the powder already present in the part bed. The part bed temperature drop lessens with raised feed bed temperatures however there are limitations. Thermal analysis of the part heater proved that the uneven part bed heat distribution was not linked to the temperature gradient of the part heater. Swing gates were found to minimise hot and cold spots but spend a substantial time oscillating on roller passing...|$|R

50|$|The fabric (or {{at least}} part of it, the top 1/3 for example) may be coated with a sealer, such as {{silicone}} or polyurethane, to make it impermeable to air. It is often the degradation of this coating and the corresponding loss of impermeability that ends the effective life of an envelope, not weakening of the fabric itself. Heat, moisture, and mechanical wear-and-tear during set-up and pack-up are the primary causes of degradation. Once an envelope becomes too porous to fly, it may be retired and discarded or perhaps used as a 'rag bag': cold inflated and opened for children to run through. Products for <b>recoating</b> the fabric are becoming available commercially.|$|E

40|$|Antibodies that {{neutralize}} rotavirus infection target outer coat proteins VP 4 and VP 7 and inhibit viral entry. The {{structure of}} a VP 7 -Fab complex (S. T. Aoki, et al., Science 324 : 1444 - 1447, 2009) led us to reclassify epitopes into two binding regions at inter- and intrasubunit boundaries of the calcium-dependent trimer. It further led us to show that antibodies binding at the intersubunit boundary inhibit uncoating of the virion outer layer. We have now tested representative antibodies {{for each of the}} defined structural epitope regions and find that antibodies recognizing epitopes in either binding region neutralize by cross-linking VP 7 trimers. Antibodies that bind at the intersubunit junction neutralize as monovalent Fabs, while those that bind at the intrasubunit region require divalency. The VP 7 structure has also allowed us to design a disulfide cross-linked VP 7 mutant which <b>recoats</b> double-layered particles (DLPs) as efficiently as does wild-type VP 7 but which yields particles defective in cell entry as determined both by lack of infectivity and by loss of α-sarcin toxicity in the presence of <b>recoated</b> particles. We conclude that dissociation of the VP 7 trimer is an essential step in viral penetration into cells...|$|R
