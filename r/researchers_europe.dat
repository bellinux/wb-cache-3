40|$|This article explores {{distinctive}} research {{patterns of}} public administration and accounting disciplines concerning public sector performance measurement (PSPM). Our review shows that accounting <b>researchers</b> from <b>Europe</b> investigate reasons for limited PM use and factors explaining a rational or symbolic PM use, inspired by organization theory and institutional theory and conducting case/field studies. Public administration <b>researchers</b> from <b>Europe</b> and the USA prefer to study PM design and PM impact respectively, mainly using surveys {{in combination with}} various theories, like political theory. Public administration research from the USA examines the types of performance indicators in PM systems and contingent factors for PM design. Public administration research from Europe shows an interest in evaluating public sector reforms like Best Value and explaining learning processes for improvement. We argue that PSPM research could benefit from interdisciplinary efforts and intensified mutual communication between public administration and accounting...|$|R
