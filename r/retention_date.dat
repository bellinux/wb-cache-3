40|$|The present {{economic}} {{level of}} concentrate supplementation for finishing steers offered silage ad libitum {{is in the}} range 4 to 7 kg per head daily depending on factors such as concentrate costs, type of animal being finished and anticipated carcass price (Keane, 1998). Concentrates are normally fed at a flat rate throughout the finishing period either as one or two discrete meals per day {{or as part of}} a mixed ration. In recent years, mainly because of the need to hold cattle until specific dates to collect premia, the practice of varying the level of concentrates throughout the finishing period has developed. Feeding a lower level early on prevents animals being finished before their eligible premia dates, and then if they are not finished as the eligible premia date approaches, the level of concentrates is increased to permit rapid disposal after the <b>retention</b> <b>date</b> has passed. As animals mature and fatten, their rate of gain declines even when energy intake remains constant. This could have an adverse effect on meat quality as there is evidence that a declining rate of gain before slaughter predisposes to poorer quality meat. Furthermore, Mediterranean markets in which Irish beef processors are showing increasing interest require carcasses with muscle which is light red in colour and fat which is white in colour. These colour traits are more likely when animals are fed a high level of concentrates {{towards the end of the}} finishing period. The objectives of the present study were 1) to compare different distribution patterns of supplementary concentrates for finishing steers, and 2) to ascertain if there were interactions between concentrate feeding pattern and breed type.

During room temperature forming process, the resistive switching (RS) behavior was activated in the thin SiO 2 (12 nm), but failed in the thick SiO 2 (23 nm). The behavior of activation failure is attributed to the reformed SiOx layer due to the unexpected recombination of excessive oxygen ions and oxygen vacancies near the TiN/SiO 2 interface. However, RS behavior can be presented successfully owing to the enhancement of driving ability of oxygen ions into TiN by employing high temperature forming process. © 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|Non-volatile memory (NVM) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the market of consumer electronics. NVM are used as a storage medium for portable devices such as mp 3 player and PDA. Dominating the NVM market in the past, flash memory has encountered many technical barriers in scaling beyond sub- 50 nm regime. Phase change memory (PCM) has become the next generation NVM to replace flash memory. PCM offers many advantages compared with flash memory, including excellent scalability, fast read/write speed and low power consumption. Most of the researches concerning PCM are focusing on its physical properties such as material properties and PCM structure. However, a PCM model suitable for circuit level simulation is not yet proposed. In this thesis, a physical model that calculates both the crystalline and amorphous state resistance of the PCM according to the PCM structure and dimension is built using resistor network method. The result of the model is compared and verified with the simulation result of device simulator. A PCM SPICE model for circuit simulation is developed and implemented in Verilog-A platform.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade access to cheap {{enabling}} technology has promoted widespread practitioner interest in online service propositions. In support of these propositions technology has become prominently established within the firm-consumer interface through self-service technologies (SSTs). SSTs are attractive to firms due to opportunities for cost reduction and the targeting of previously in-accessible customer segments. This attractiveness {{has led to an}} increasing shift in the mode of service provision from traditional personal service delivery to SSTs, which have evolved from limited time saving alternatives to the proliferation of chargeable subscription-based services in operation today. However, the viability of these channels relies on the customers’ perception of value creation {{and the degree to which}} the SST contributes to it. Consequently, realising the potential benefits from SSTs has continued to be problematic for firms as they still have a poor understanding of how value is co-created across technology interfaces. Key to understanding this phenomenon is how value emerges through the customer experience, which has now transcended the traditional consumer/firm perspective to include the users’ wider social network of actors. This is a gap in the literature and an important area of enquiry since it directly affects subscription channel uptake and long-term customer <b>retention.</b> To <b>date</b> the extant empirical literature has not conceptualised value as emerging through the customers’ experience or included current marketing thought, which views the customer as a resource integrator that co-creates value within a wider social network of actors. The contribution of this study lies in the development of a new measurement instrument that addresses these gaps and captures experiential value in an online subscription context. The context is Royal Mail’s online postage channel (SmartStamp®) and the research is set within the value literature. Service Dominant Logic specifies that value is always uniquely and phenomenologically determined by the beneficiary, which has led to criticism (by the phenomenological school of thought) of the way multi-dimensional value models have previously made knowledge claims about value, since it is potentially both subjective and context specific. Uniquely, this research seeks to empirically address the phenomenological criticisms using accumulated experience as the mainstay of claims to ontological and epistemological legitimacy. The conceptualisation of experiential value in this thesis is applicable to most online subscription contexts and the contribution of this study also extends to informing future studies in this topical and important area...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to document the psychological adjustment of adolescents who were conceived through donor insemination by lesbian mothers who enrolled before these offspring were born in the largest, longest running, prospective, longitudinal study of same-sex-parented families. METHODS: Between 1986 and 1992, 154 prospective lesbian mothers volunteered for a study that was designed to follow planned lesbian families from the index children's conception until they reached adulthood. Data for the current report were gathered through interviews and questionnaires that were completed by 78 index offspring when they were 10 and 17 years old and through interviews and Child Behavior Checklists that were completed by their mothers at corresponding times. The study is ongoing, with a 93 % <b>retention</b> rate to <b>date.</b> RESULTS: According to their mothers' reports, the 17 -year-old daughters and sons of lesbian mothers were rated significantly higher in social, school/academic, and total competence and significantly lower in social problems, rule-breaking, aggressive, and externalizing problem behavior than their age-matched counterparts in Achenbach's normative sample of American youth. Within the lesbian family sample, no Child Behavior Checklist differences were found among adolescent offspring who were conceived by known, as-yet-unknown, and permanently unknown donors or between offspring whose mothers were still together and offspring whose mothers had separated.

They were also asked to specify their sexual identity on the Kinsey scale, between exclusively heterosexual and exclusively homosexual. Lifetime sexual behavior was assessed through questions about heterosexual and same-sex contact, age of first sexual experience, contraception use, and pregnancy.

Data were collected in five waves, first at insemination or during pregnancy, and subsequently when the index children were 2, 5, 10 and 17 years old. The study is ongoing, with a 93 % <b>retention</b> rate to <b>date.</b> The purpose of the current investigation was to assess changes in psychological adjustment of the index offspring between the time that they were 10 and 17 years old (T 4 and T 5) and {{to examine the effects of}} having a known or an as-yet-unknown donor. Methods: The total T 5 sample consisted of 78 adolescents. The mothers in 74 families completed a Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) on their offspring at both T 4 and T 5 : 26 of these offspring had been conceived through known sperm donors and 48 through unknown donors. Changes in psychological adjustment were assessed through computations of stability coefficients between T 4 and T 5 on all CBCL subscales, and by means of a general linear model (GLM). Results: On 10 out of 11 CBCL subscales, the stability coefficients were not significantly different for adolescents with known and unknown donors.

40|$|Introduction: To {{overcome}} patients’ reported {{barriers to}} accessing anti-retroviral therapy (ART), a community-based delivery model was piloted in Tete, Mozambique. Community ART Groups (CAGs) of maximum six patients stable on ART offered cost- and time-saving benefits and mutual psychosocial support, {{which resulted in}} better adherence and <b>retention</b> outcomes. To <b>date,</b> Médecins Sans Frontières has coordinated and supported these community-driven activities. Methods: To better understand the sustainability of the CAG model, we developed a conceptual framework on sustainability of community-based programmes. This was used to explore the data retrieved from 16 focus group discussions and 24 in-depth interviews with different stakeholder groups involved in the CAG model and to identify factors influencing the sustainability of the CAG model. Results: We report the findings according to the framework's five components. (1) The CAG model was designed to overcome patients’ barriers to ART and was built on a concept of self-management and patient empowerment to reach effective results. (2) Despite the progressive Ministry of Health (MoH) involvement, the daily management of the model is still strongly dependent on external resources, especially {{the need for a}} regulatory cadre to form and monitor the groups. These additional resources are in contrast to the limited MoH resources available. (3) The model is strongly embedded in the community, with patients taking {{a more active role in}} their own healthcare and that of their peers. They are considered as partners in healthcare, which implies a new healthcare approach. (4) There is a growing enabling environment with political will and general acceptance to support the CAG model. (5) However, contextual factors, such as poverty, illiteracy and the weak health system, influence the community-based model and need to be addressed. Conclusions: The community embeddedness of the model, together with patient empowerment, high acceptability and progressive MoH involvement strongly favour the future sustainability of the CAG model. The high dependency on external resources for the model's daily management, however, can potentially jeopardize its sustainability. Further reflections are required on possible solutions to solve these challenges, especially in terms of human resources...|$|R
40|$|In 1993, 2. 4 million {{students}} entered college; of those, some 1. 1 million will leave without a degree (Tinto, 1993). This {{is not a}} new trend. Data from the American College Testing Program show that the first-year attrition rate for all students in four-year public universities has remained largely unchanged over the last decade. In 1983, this rate was 29. 1 %; in 1992 it was 28. 3 % (Tinto, 1993). The other end of the undergraduate time-scale looks equally distressing. In 1983, the graduation rate at the same institutions was 52. 6 % while in 1992 it had declined to 46. 7 %. The phenomenon of college attrition is even more exaggerated among certain underrepresented minority groups. Hispanics graduated at a rate of only 35 %, and African [End Page 55] Americans at a rate of only 45 % (Brower, 1992), far below the rates for White students (Tinto, 1993).

Broadly speaking, retention efforts that have addressed one or another of these factors can be classified into two categories. The first assumes that students who do not graduate were underprepared for college work at entrance; individual student deficiencies are thus seen as responsible for attrition (Boykin...|$|R

During multivariable analysis weight below 50 kg (aHR: 1. 33, 95 %CI: 1. 05 - 1. 69), higher WHO stage at initiation (aHR: 1. 22, 95 %CI 0. 85 - 1. 76 for stage 3 and aHR: 2. 98, 95 %CI: 1. 93 - 4. 59 for stage 4), and male sex (aHR: 1. 32, 95 %CI: 1. 05 - 1. 65) remained as significant risk factors for attrition during the first year after ART initiation. Other independent risk factors were year of initiation (aHR: 1. 73, 95 %CI: 1. 26 - 2. 38 for the year 2007 and aHR: 3. 06, 95 %CI: 2. 26 - 4. 14 for the period 2008 - 2009), and site. CONCLUSIONS: Retention is a major problem in DRC, while coverage {{of patients}} on ART is still very low. With the flattening of funding for HIV care and treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, and with decreasing funding worldwide, maximizing retention during the much needed scaling-up will even be more important...|$|R

The {{effect of}} harvest date and {{inoculation}} on the yield, fermentation characteristics and feeding value of kale silage. ? Grass and Forage Science, 56, (2), 151 - 161. Sponsorship: UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Milk Development Council. Using new harvesting and ensiling technologies, {{it is now}} possible to ensile kale (Brassica oleracea) successfully. However, there is little information available regarding the optimum time for harvest. The aim of this 2 -year study was to compare the yield, fermentation characteristics and feeding value of kale harvested at different stages of growth, and ensiled with and without a bacterial inoculant. During Year 1 the crop was harvested after 15, 18 and 20 weeks of growth. The yield at each harvest was similar, but as the crop matured the crude protein (CP) concentration and buffering capacity decreased significantly, and there was a marked increase in the water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) concentration. During Year 2 the crop was harvested at 14 and 17 weeks of growth. Again, the stage of maturity did not affect yield and, on this occasion, the chemical composition of the crop was unaffected by harvest date. However, the WSC and CP concentrations of the crop were lower in Year 2 than in Year 1, possibly as a result of differences in fertilizer regime. Each of the silages produced in Year 2 was offered to six Suffolk cross wether lambs, aged 10 months, to measure voluntary intake, in vivo digestibility and nitrogen <b>retention.</b> Neither harvesting <b>date</b> nor the use of an inoculant affected voluntary intake or nitrogen retention by the lambs. However, in vivo digestibility was higher in the kale silage harvested after 14 weeks of growth and when an inoculant was applied. The results obtained suggest that harvesting kale after 14 weeks of growth can produce highly digestible silage with a high CP concentration. Although delaying harvest until 18 weeks of growth will probably result in a decrease in the CP concentration of the crop, it should also lead to an increase in the WSC concentration of the crop, ensuring a more reliable fermentation.

40|$|Professional {{sports teams}} {{according}} to Madura (1982) possess very similar Human Resource Management (HRM) characteristics {{to those on}} display in many other business entities, especially those located in the small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector. Research investigating the HRM processes of Professional Sports Organisation (PSOs) has predominately focused on player recruitment systems, with little attention being given to the degree which sports organisations apply established workplace HRM selection processes to athlete selection procedures (Bradbury & Forsyth, 2012). Other aspects of the HRM framework (e. g. orientation and socialisation, training and development, and <b>retention)</b> have, to <b>date,</b> largely been ignored from a sport management perspective. The football-related literature in this area, for example, is dominated by examples of labour migration, which is heavily influenced by World System Theory (Magee & Sugden, 2002). While further suggesting that football players {{are nothing more than}} commodities which can be sold or traded resulting in either a net profit or loss (Maguire, 1999). European clubs at the core of world football dominate the transfer market and acquire the best talent. The financial muscle of these particular clubs along with other “push” and “pull” factors has led to a global migration of playing talent, as players now of all ages seek new opportunities to continue plying their trade. To date, current sports migration literature has neglected the connection between player migration and organisational HRM practices, a connection that needs to be established given that a PSO’s success significantly relies on their ability to arrange their playing resources into a collective group, a process that has the potential to generate a competitive advantage. Currently, player registration periods in professional football are a hive of activity, as players and their agents seek new opportunities to advance or prolong their athletic careers, while the clubs utilise these periods to restructure their own human resource portfolios, to satisfy the needs and wants of their key stakeholders (fans, sponsors and financial investors). Traditionally, football clubs recruited players from their own local community, but with the diffusion of the “global game” clubs are increasingly looking further afield to uncover new playing talent, searches that typically occur across the following three distinct levels; (1) between clubs competing within the same competition in the same country, (2) between clubs competing in different competitions in the same country, and (3) clubs competing in different leagues in different countries. This thesis adopts the traditional HRM framework provided by Hoye, Nicholson, Smith, Stewart, and Westerbeck (2012) to identify and analyse the recruitment and retention processes employed by football franchises in Australasia’s only full-time professional league (the A-League). The interpretive investigation was completed via an abductive mixed-method case study approach, where data was collected in two consecutive but distinct phases. Statistical data related to player recruitment and retention was collected, revealing the average age for a local player entering the league (23 years) was noticeably different to the average age of a European player (30 years old) and that, on average, these foreign imports – most of whom were found to be attack-minded players – spent less than two years playing in the competition. These findings were used as a platform (i. e. conversation-starter) to complete eight semi-structured interviews with purposefully targeted individuals involved in contract negotiation proceedings. To ensure information was gathered that presented the perspectives of both sides interviews were completed with both franchise CEOs and player agents. Concepts identified during these discussions were refined to explain why the A-League HRM processes surrounding recruitment and retention of football players has evolved in such a manner, while also allowing an “A-League specific” HRM model to be developed. Overall, it was concluded that A-league HRM processes are vastly determined by aspects associated with relationships, responsibility, and reputations. The identification of these three key factors allowed recommendations to be generated to allow all current and any future A-league franchises the opportunity to develop more sustainable HRM strategies, such as developing a formal induction program for all new players. Other recommendations for future research are also presented...|$|R
