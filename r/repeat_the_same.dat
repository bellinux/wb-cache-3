5|$|With {{regards to}} the plot, the {{producers}} wanted to <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> style as the previous sixth series and include another story-arc in the seventh. The writers and producers got together {{to think about what}} is to become a big political story that will affect the United Kingdom in twelve to eighteen months time. They decided on using the resurgence of power in Russia following the end of the Cold War, which the producers felt in subtle ways, is threatening the security of the West. The new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying, truth, and who the character should trust. The episode was written by Neil Cross. It was also additionally written by Ben Richards.|$|E
25|$|Barangay Ginebra was {{eliminated}} {{early in the}} quarterfinals by Tanduay in the 2000 All-Filipino Cup, {{as well as the}} Commissioner's Cup.

25|$|The next year, the IRA {{was able}} to <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{operation}} against another British coal ship, the St. Bedan, bound from Glasgow to Derry. The 1,250 BRT Bedan, built in Clyde and also launched in 1972, was owned by J & A Gardner & Co. Ltd. of Glasgow. On February 23, 1982, the ship was at anchor off Derry, awaiting the tide to proceed upstream.|$|E
25|$|Forest {{areas around}} mining centers were deforested first, {{consuming}} all natural resources {{around the area}} of work. Once all the natural resources around the area of production were consumed, wood was then shipped and carried in to supply the furnaces and smelters for the mining centers. Eventually, these centers would shut down and move to areas within Roman territory to <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> cycle of deforestation, supplying an ever-growing population and consumption demand.|$|E

25|$|Forum {{spamming}} is {{a breach}} of netiquette where users <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> word or phrase over and over, but differs from multiple posting in that spamming is usually a willful act that sometimes has malicious intent. This is a common trolling technique. It can also be traditional spam, unpaid advertisements that are in breach of the forum's rules. Spammers utilize a number of illicit techniques to post their spam, {{including the use of}} botnets.|$|E

Eilif is executed for killing a peasant while stealing livestock, trying to <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> act for which he was praised as hero in wartime, but Mother Courage never hears thereof. When she finds out the war continues, the Cook and Mother Courage move on with the wagon.|$|E

25|$|During the {{development}} of the first anime, Arakawa allowed the anime staff to work independently from her, and requested a different ending from that of the manga. She said that she would not like to <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> ending in both media, and wanted to make the manga longer so she could develop the characters. When watching the ending of the anime, she was amazed about how different the homunculi creatures were from the manga and enjoyed how the staff speculated about the origins of the villains. Because Arakawa helped the Bones staff in the making of the series, she was kept from focusing on the manga's cover illustrations and had little time to make them.|$|E
25|$|Tank destroyers {{offered some}} {{advantages}} over towed anti-tank guns, since a static gun emplacement sacrificed concealment and surprise after firing the first shot; however, the same gun {{mounted on a}} tracked or wheeled chassis could open fire and throw a tank formation into substantial disarray before quickly withdrawing to <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> tactic elsewhere. The introduction of tank destroyers also {{put an end to}} the traditional tactic of suppressing anti-tank gun batteries with heavy artillery bombardments, as their crews were now well-protected under armor. They were not without their own series of disadvantages, however, namely presenting a much larger target than a towed gun, the added responsibilities of vehicle maintenance and logistical support, and the limited spaces in which the crew had to operate and stow all their available ammunition.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that while}} bound orbits {{of a point}} mass or a spherical body with a Newtonian {{gravitational}} field are closed ellipses, which <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> path exactly and indefinitely, any non-spherical or non-Newtonian effects (such as caused by the slight oblateness of the Earth, or by relativistic effects, thereby changing the gravitational field's behavior with distance) will cause the orbit's shape to depart from the closed ellipses characteristic of Newtonian two-body motion. The two-body solutions were published by Newton in Principia in 1687. In 1912, Karl Fritiof Sundman developed a converging infinite series that solves the three-body problem; however, it converges too slowly to be of much use. Except for special cases like the Lagrangian points, no method is known to solve the equations of motion for a system with four or more bodies.|$|E

25|$|In Russia, the war {{was covered}} by {{anonymous}} satirical graphic luboks for sale in markets, recording the war for the domestic audience. Around 300 were made before their creation was banned by the Russian government. Their Japanese equivalents were woodblock prints. These had been common during the Sino-Japanese war a decade earlier and celebrations of the new conflict tended to <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> imagery and situations. But by this time in Japan postcards had become {{the most common form}} of communication and they soon replaced prints as a medium for topographical imagery and war reportage. In some ways, however, they were still dependent on the print for their pictorial conventions, not least in issuing the cards in series that assembled into a composite scene or design, either as diptychs, triptychs or even more ambitious formats. However, captioning swiftly moved from the calligraphic side inscription to a printed title below, and not just in Japanese but in English and other European languages. There was a lively sense that these images served not only as mementoes but also as propaganda statements.|$|E
25|$|On August 14, 1997, Schmitz {{created a}} Geocities website called Bookhouse's Previews of Upcoming Movies {{as a way}} to avoid having to <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{information}} in chat rooms and message boards when people would ask questions about movies that had not been released yet, or that were rumored to be at some stage of development in Hollywood. The site quickly outgrew GeoCities, and was re-launched under the name of Upcomingmovies.com in early 1998. By October 1999, the site was earning enough of an income from advertising that Schmitz was able to quit his day job as a librarian. In 2001, Schmitz teamed up with Yahoo! Movies, bringing the site there under the new name of Greg's Previews of Upcoming Movies. Schmitz also moved to Santa Monica, California as part of the change, and during his time in California, he co-starred in a television pilot for MGM Television called The Movie Fan Show, was frequently quoted in publications like USA Today and The Chicago Sun-Times, and made several radio appearances, including The Howard Stern Show.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. Chambering should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their legs up close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E

Political commentators have noted that the diminishing of the Communist Youth League faction curtailed the influence of former President Hu Jintao, solidifying Xi's own political faction. Xi effectively closed the Central School of China Communist Youth League, folding it into the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He also demoted the league‘s chief and imprisoned one of its top officials.|$|E
