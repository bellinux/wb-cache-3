2500|$|Jock Robert Anderson (born 23 January 1941) is an Australian {{agricultural}} economist, specialising {{in agricultural}} development economics, risk and decision theory, and international <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>policy.</b> [...] Born in Monto, Queensland, he {{studied at the}} University of Queensland, attaining bachelor's and master's degrees in agricultural science. [...] After graduation, Anderson joined the Faculty of Agricultural Economics at the University of New England. [...] At New England, he focused on research in farm management, risk, and uncertainty and received a doctor of philosophy in economics in 1970. [...] In 1977, Anderson co-authored a book, Agricultural Decision Analysis, which has served as an influential source on risk and decision analysis for agricultural economics researchers and the agricultural industry.|$|E

40|$|Objective. Government {{policy has}} long linked {{resource}} production with economic <b>development</b> in surrounding <b>rural</b> communities. The {{purpose of this}} article is to examine how the USDA Forest Service 2 ̆ 7 s (USFS) resource-based, <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> have shifted due to economic restructuring and environmental challenges to the 2 ̆ 2 management 2 ̆ 2 of nature. Methods. Historical data was gathered on USFS timber harvests and policies toward forest-dependent communities. Data was also gathered through interviews and participant-observation on a USFS-supported, locally planned ecotourism project. Results. USFS <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> have shifted from predominantly providing federally determined, sustained timber harvests in the industrial era to increasingly emphasizing local, amenity-based entrepreneurship and economic diversification in the post-industrial era. Conclusions. USFS <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> and resource production have been de-coupled. However, amenity-based development may depend both on amenity migrants and sustained commitment from external sources to support local initiative, given limited entrepreneurship in rural areas long dependent on high-wage extraction and manufacturing...|$|R

2500|$|Since 2000, the EU <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Policy</b> {{has been}} in effect, {{also known as the}} [...] "second pillar" [...] of the CAP. This policy aims to promote the economic, social and {{environmental}} development of the countryside. Its budget, 11% of the total EU budget, is today allocated along three axes. The first axis focuses on improving the competitiveness of the farm and forestry sector through support for restructuring, development and innovation. The second one concerns the improvement of the environment and the countryside through support for land management as well as helping to fight climate change. Such projects could for example concern preserving water quality, sustainable land management, planting trees to prevent erosion and floods. The third axis concerns improving {{the quality of life in}} rural areas and encouraging diversification of economic activity. The policy also provides support to the Leader rural development methodology, under which Local Action Groups design and carry out local development strategies for their area.

40|$|China's {{rural areas}} are {{undergoing}} considerable spatio-temporal change. To some extent, this change increases {{the difficulty in}} our understanding the regional <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> and thus brings about challenges for the making of feasible regional <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> and strategic planning. This study establishes an index system to evaluate the degree of rurality in China at county level using national census data of 2000 and 2010, and examines the correlationship between rurality index and major socio-economic and geographical indicators. The results of evaluation and spatial analysis show that the rurality index can largely reflect the spatio-temporal patterns of China's <b>rural</b> <b>development,</b> and the Pearson correlation analysis confirmed that counties with high rurality have been marginalized in the aspects of both geographical location and economic development. As such, the patterns of <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> identified by rurality index analysis significantly improve our knowledge on the recent <b>development</b> of <b>rural</b> China. However, this index is less successful in revealing the agricultural production status quo alone. The authors argue that rurality index is an important tool for measuring <b>rural</b> <b>development,</b> and could provide us with valuable information for local planning and the innovation of <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>policies.</b> Furthermore, integrating rurality studies and rural socio-economic analysis can contribute greatly to the making of integrated and regionalized <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>policies.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The application is realized in Maule Region (Chile), where at present a strong agrarian economy co-exists with a weak rurality.

40|$|Structured Abstract Purpose – The study aims at {{explaining}} that sustaining <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> helps to support entrepreneurship combining {{social and economic}} business leading to design hybrid organizations. Rural resources as entrepreneurial milieu shape the entrepreneurial process. European <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> support the economic growth of rural areas driving new business opportunities for rural entrepreneurs creating social and economic value. Design/methodology/approach – Social entrepreneurs address new social needs in entrepreneurial ways showing a high social responsible orientation by aligning the activities that generate profit, environmental and social benefits building hybrid organizations focusing on social value creation within or outside the organization’s boundaries. The study relies on archival and qualitative data drawn by review of literature on social entrepreneurship and hybrids organizations, {{on the role of}} <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> by describing the European framework and policies promoting the sustainable <b>development</b> of <b>rural</b> areas and communities. Originality/value – <b>Rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> help to revitalize rural economies and communities. Rurality as dynamic concept and synonym of diversity, history, landscape, heritage, traditions and values related to renewal of agriculture within post-industrial society where rural entrepreneurs emerge as partners for driving local economic development by promoting wealth, environmental and social benefits.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between multifunctionality in agriculture and <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> {{in the light of the}} ongoing debate in Europe on possible strategies to enhance the secondary functions of agriculture. More in details, it examines the widespread but ambiguous identification of the so-called CAP “second pillar” policies as the strategy tout court for the valorisation of multifunctionality, especially in their territorial component. Actually, if one accepts the definition of multifunctionality as the joint production of primary (agricultural) and secondary (externalities) goods, it is rather the sector-based component of <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> that can contribute to the enhancement of the multifunctional role of agriculture. The paper compares the way multifunctionality has been enhanced within the <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> programmes of three member States (Italy, United Kingdom and France) on the basis of three parameters: the beneficiaries of the specific actions; the nature of the explicit goals pursued; possible constraints imposed on the goals.
