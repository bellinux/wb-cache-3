50|$|With CAV LaserDiscs {{the user}} can jump {{directly}} to any individual frame {{of a video}} simply by entering the frame number on the <b>remote</b> <b>keypad,</b> a feature not common among DVD players. Some DVD players have cache features which stores {{a certain amount of}} the video in RAM which allows the player to index a DVD as quickly as an LD, even down to the frame in some players.|$|E
50|$|Control {{systems are}} a variety of <b>remotes</b> and <b>keypads</b> that allow the users to operate their speaker systems. SpeakerCraft control systems include MODE, Multi Zone Controllers, EZ-Pad System, and SmartPath.|$|R
50|$|A TAD {{may offer}} {{a remote control}} facility, whereby the {{answerphone}} owner can ring the home number and, by entering a code on the <b>remote</b> telephone's <b>keypad,</b> can listen to recorded messages, or delete them, even when away from home.|$|R
5000|$|User Interface - The User Interface {{receives}} {{input from}} a user wanting {{to control the}} system. UI devices include touch panels, <b>keypads,</b> <b>remotes,</b> and mobile apps.|$|R
5000|$|Aside {{from early}} hobbyist/kit/home {{computers}} and some video game consoles, membrane-based QWERTY keyboards {{are used in}} some industrial computer systems, and are also found as portable, even [...] "rollable-collapsible" [...] designs for PDAs and other pocket computing devices. Smaller, specialised membrane keyboards, typically numeric-and-a-few-control-keys only, {{have been used in}} access control systems (for buildings and restricted areas), simple handheld calculators, domestic <b>remote</b> control <b>keypads,</b> microwave ovens, and other similar devices where the amount of typing is relatively small or infrequent, such as cell phones.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, {{the company}} became the {{exclusive}} distributor of Dance Battle VS. In addition, they released the PlayStation 3 Remotext, a Blu-ray <b>remote</b> control and <b>keypad</b> game controller hybrid, and a battery-expanding attachment for the Nintendo 3DS called the Powerplus. They also created the Supaboy, a handheld Super Nintendo.|$|R
50|$|To {{allow for}} {{wireless}} <b>keypads,</b> <b>remote</b> switches, motion sensors, et cetera, an RF protocol is also defined. X10 wireless devices send data packets that are {{nearly identical to}} the NEC IR protocol used by many IR remotes, and a radio receiver then provides a bridge which translates these radio packets to ordinary X10 power line control packets. The wireless protocol operates at a frequency of 310 MHz in the U.S. and 433.92 MHz in European systems.|$|R
50|$|Window blinds can be {{manually}} drawn using a cord, or automated through motorization. Controls for motorized blinds can {{be from a}} wall switch or <b>keypad,</b> <b>remote</b> control, or computer, {{eliminating the}} need for cords and allowing control of otherwise inaccessible windows. A number of modern homes are integrating blind control with central C-Bus solutions. This control provides ease-of-use and is effective for controlling blind operation to reduce heat loss during winter or minimize heat from the sun during summer.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{idea was to}} persuade consumers to buy a modified television set with an inbuilt modem and a <b>keypad</b> <b>remote</b> control in order to access the service, {{but no more than}} a handful of models were ever marketed and they were prohibitively expensive. Eventually set-top boxes were made available, and some organisations made these available as part of their subscription, for example branded Tandata terminals were provided by the Nottingham Building Society for its customers, who could make financial transactions via Prestel.|$|R
50|$|Such {{developments}} could literally {{change the}} face of current machines and have far-reaching implications on how users interact with them. Hand-held devices would be designed with larger, easier-to-view screens, as no keyboard would be required. Touch-screen devices would no longer need to split the display between content and an on-screen keyboard, thus providing full-screen viewing of the content. Laptop computers could essentially be cut in half in terms of size, as the keyboard half would be eliminated and all internal components would be integrated behind the display, effectively resulting in a simple tablet computer. Desktop computers would consist of a CPU and screen, saving desktop space otherwise occupied by the keyboard and eliminating sliding keyboard rests built under the desk's surface. Television <b>remote</b> controls and <b>keypads</b> on dozens of other devices, from microwave ovens to photocopiers, could also be eliminated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{explored}} {{the applicability of}} gesture commands in a PDA to the operation of DVD players, video tape players and TVs. Firstly, 58 {{subjects were asked to}} write the appropriate gesture commands for each of the 11 pre-selected commonly used operations in controlling video equipments. From this set of written gesture commands as well as the gesture commands used in the PalmRemote for Palm OS, five commands were screened for each operation by experts with the consideration on frequency been written, compliance with the one stroke writing rule and ease of writing. Another 50 subjects then were recruited to select the most appropriate command from the set of five commands for each of operation. With minor adjustment, a most appropriate set of gesture commands for the 11 operations was summarized. In the second phase of this study, three tasks were designed to simulated the commonly operations on video equipments. Eighteen subjects were asked to execute the three tasks by using conventional remote controller, <b>remote</b> control <b>keypads</b> on Sony CLIE PDA, and the devised gesture commands on Sony CLIE PDA in random sequence. Time and error rate on execution these tasks with three different operation approaches were compared and analyzed. Due to our familiarity with conventional remote controllers, it can be most effectively used to operate video devises. However, gesture commands can be performed more effective than control keypads, if we want to use a PDA to replace a remote controller in operating video equipments...|$|R
