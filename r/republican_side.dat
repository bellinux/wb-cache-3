5|$|In the at-large races, the two {{incumbent}} Democratic candidates, Victor E. Moore and Paul D'Ortona, led the ticket. Three other Democrats {{were also}} elected: John F. Byrne, Sr., {{who had previously}} been councilman for the 10th district; Henry W. Sawyer, a civil rights lawyer; and Marshall L. Shepard, a clergyman who had served as Commissioner of Records. On the <b>Republican</b> <b>side,</b> incumbent at-large councilman Louis Schwartz was re-elected. The other Republican incumbent, Donald C. Rubel, who had won a special election as an independent Republican backed by Democrats, lost his spot to Thomas M. Foglietta, a young lawyer and son of former councilman Michael Foglietta. Also losing bids for the Republican at-large seats were real estate assessor F. Raymond Heuges and former magistrate Hobson R. Reynolds.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Army of Africa {{crossed the}} Gibraltar Strait, using Junkers Ju 52 {{transport}} planes provided by Nazi Germany, without any loyalist Air Force interference {{owing to the}} confusion and lack of decision of the Spanish <b>Republican</b> <b>side.</b> The massive airlift of troops from Spanish Morocco was the world's first long-range combat airlift and it allowed Franco's troops to join General Queipo de Llano's forces in Seville. Their quick movement allowed them to meet General Mola's Northern Army and secure most of northern and northwestern Spain, as well as central and western Andalusia. The Republican Government ended up with controlling {{almost all of the}} Eastern Spanish coast and central area around Madrid, as well as Asturias, Cantabria and part of the Basque Country in the north. Mola was keen {{to create a sense of}} fear within Nationalist-controlled areas. There was a massive purge of freemasons, and a wide part of the left, including some moderate socialists.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{was left}} to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of {{thousands}} of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the <b>republican</b> <b>side</b> with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land. There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former. There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.|$|E
50|$|During the Spanish Civil War, {{both the}} right-wing Nationalist and left-wing <b>Republican</b> <b>sides</b> of the {{conflict}} made use of this execution method on their prisoners, though the practice was far more widespread {{on the part of}} the Nationalists.|$|R
50|$|Like much of Belfast, the Shore Road saw {{a number}} of {{paramilitary}} attacks during the Troubles. Paramilitaries from both the Ulster loyalist and Irish <b>republican</b> <b>sides</b> were both active on the Shore Road, {{both in terms of}} recruiting members and in carrying out attacks.|$|R
40|$|In French Position of Nationalist and <b>Republican</b> <b>sides</b> given; {{both sides}} wish to end {{struggle}} and have appealed to Pope and England to help moderate negotiations; little difference between views of moderates in both camps; soldiers of one camp often fraternize with {{soldiers of the}} other; both sides wish {{to get rid of}} German and Italian influence and eliminate from power all Communists and extremists...|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} tumultuous primary {{election}} seasons ever began as the Tet Offensive was launched, followed by the withdrawal of President Johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly in the New Hampshire primary; it concluded with the assassination {{of one of the}} Democratic candidates, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, just moments after his victory in the California primary. On the <b>Republican</b> <b>side,</b> Nixon's main opposition was Michigan Governor George Romney, though New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention. Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot. He selected Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.|$|E

5000|$|However, a {{large number}} of Hispanics and Latinos, who {{predominantly}} reside in District 23, had expressed disdain for Bonilla by stating that he had fallen {{out of touch with the}} needs and concerns of minorities. His reputation even earned him the nickname [...] "Henry Vanilla," [...] as some Hispanics claimed that Bonilla no longer could relate to his culture. In a year of war, illegal immigration issues, and a proposed border fence, Latinos left the <b>Republicans</b> <b>side</b> in droves.|$|R
25|$|During the Irish War of Independence, {{the area}} was rocked by sectarian violence, partly {{prompted}} by the guerilla war raging between the Irish Republican Army and British forces, but also influenced by economic and social pressures. By mid-1920 there was severe sectarian rioting in the city. Many lives were lost and in addition many Catholics and Protestants were {{expelled from their homes}} during this communal unrest. After a week's violence, a truce was negotiated by local politicians on both unionist and <b>republican</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Alsedo {{class was}} a Spanish class of destroyer. Three ships were built, {{based on a}} British design, {{entering}} service from between 1924 and 1925. They all served through and survived the Spanish Civil War, two on the <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> and one with the Nationalists, with the class finally retired in 1957–61.|$|E

25|$|Basques: They were gudaris (Basque nationalists {{and other}} Basque Government battalions) who had {{escaped from the}} siege of Santander and, {{transferred}} by sea to the <b>Republican</b> <b>side,</b> had continued fighting outside of their homeland. Due to the proximity of Gurs to their homeland, practically all managed to find local backing that permitted them to abandon the camp and find work and refuge in France.|$|E
25|$|South Armagh {{has a long}} Irish republican tradition. Many men in {{the area}} served in the Fourth Northern Division of the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence (1919–21) and, unlike {{most of the rest}} of the Northern Ireland IRA, on the <b>republican</b> <b>side</b> in the Irish Civil War (1922–23).

2500|$|Political {{rallies in}} celebration of the former leader are now banned by the Historical Memory Law, voted on by the Congress of Deputies on 16 October 2007. This law {{dictated}} that [...] "the management organisation of the Valley of the Fallen should aim to honor the memory {{of all of those}} who died during the civil war and who suffered repression". It has been suggested that The Valley of the Fallen be re-designated as a [...] "monument to Democracy" [...] or as a memorial to all Spaniards killed in conflict [...] "for Democracy". Some organisations, among them centrist Catholic groups, question the purpose of these plans, on the basis that the monument is already dedicated to all of the dead, civilian and military of both Nationalist and <b>Republican</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R
25|$|Spain {{was ranked}} as the 30th coal {{producing}} {{country in the}} world in 2010. The coal miners of Spain were active in the Spanish Civil War on the <b>Republican</b> <b>side.</b> In October 1934, in Asturias, union miners and others suffered a fifteen-day siege in Oviedo and Gijon. There is a museum dedicated to coal mining in the region of Catalonia, called Cercs Mine Museum.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} Liam Devlin in the Jack Higgins 1975 thriller The Eagle Has Landed {{seems to}} be based on Frank Ryan. Higgins's Devlin, like Ryan, is an IRA man who has fought on the <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> in Spain, was captured and was afterwards passed on to the Germans – but in the book he is then recruited to join a (fictional) commando raid into England, aimed at capturing Winston Churchill.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, the <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> of the House {{voted to}} block a $150million loan {{guarantee}} for Cape Wind, acknowledging that the block was narrowly targeted. The block may not be effective, as an agreement may be reached before the block comes into place. The project has a $600million loan guarantee from the Danish export credit agency (their biggest ever) and another $200million from PensionDanmark, and the combined funding amounted to $1.45billion.|$|E
5000|$|The Iowa Democratic Presidential Caucus {{occurred}} on January 3, 2008, {{and was the}} state caucuses of the Iowa Democratic Party. It was the first election for the Democrats of the 2008 presidential election. Also referred to as [...] "the First in the Nation Caucus," [...] {{it was the first}} election of the primary season on both the Democratic and <b>Republican</b> <b>sides.</b> Of the eight major Democratic presidential candidates, then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois received the most votes and was ultimately declared the winner of the Iowa Democratic Caucus of 2008, making him the first African American to win the caucus. Former U.S. Senator John Edwards of North Carolina came in second place and then-U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton of New York finished third, though Clinton received more delegates than Edwards. Campaigning had begun as early as two years before the event.|$|R
25|$|In 1993, Santorum {{was one of}} 17 House <b>Republicans</b> who <b>sided</b> {{with most}} Democrats to support {{legislation}} that prohibited employers from permanently replacing striking employees.

As a member of the Gang of Seven, Santorum was involved in exposing members of Congress involved in the House banking scandal.|$|R
50|$|Her {{family was}} deeply {{political}} {{and supported the}} <b>Republican</b> (anti-Treaty) <b>side</b> during the Irish Civil War. Both of her parents, Patrick and Elizabeth (née Mulligan) Flanagan, both served as Lord Mayor of Sligo. She was good friends with fellow Irish actresses Joan O'Hara and Paddy Croft. Flanagan {{spent much of the}} early 1950s touring with Anew McMaster, where she met Harold Pinter at the Gate's Pinter Festival.|$|R
25|$|One of de Valera's finest hours was his {{regrouping}} of the <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> after {{defeat in}} the civil war, and setting his followers on an exclusively peaceful and democratic path, along which he later had to confront both domestic Fascism and the IRA. He became a democratic statesman, not a dictator. He did not purge the civil service {{of those who had}} served his predecessors, but made best use of the talent available.|$|E
25|$|The armies kept growing. The {{principal}} {{source of}} manpower was conscription; both sides continued and expanded their schemes, the Nationalists drafting somewhat more aggressively, {{and there was}} little room left for volunteering. Foreigners contributed little to further growth; on the Nationalist side the Italians scaled down their engagement, while on the <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> the influx of new interbrigadistas did not cover losses suffered by these units on the front. At the turn of 1937/1938 both armies achieved numerical parity and equalled about 700,000 each.|$|E
25|$|The party {{came close}} to expressing support for the <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> of the Spanish Civil War – on grounds of {{supporting}} defence of democracy (some writers initially took Spain {{as an example of}} what could happen if the capitalists class tried to use force to overturn the result of a socialist electoral revolution). This led to a debate within the party and resulted in an official statement that fell short of supporting the pro-capitalist republican government, but offering general support to workers in their struggle for democracy.|$|E
