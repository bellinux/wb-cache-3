5|$|HMS Audacious was {{the lead}} ship of the s built for the Royal Navy in the late 1860s. They were {{designed}} as second-class ironclads suitable for use on foreign stations and the ship spent the bulk of her career on the China Station. She was decommissioned in 1894 and hulked in 1902 {{for use as a}} training ship. The ship was towed to Scapa Flow after the beginning of the First World War {{to be used as a}} <b>receiving</b> <b>ship</b> and then to Rosyth after the war ended. Audacious was sold for scrap in 1929.|$|E
5|$|In October 1811, Aigle {{was sent}} to the Mediterranean where she and her crew raided the island of Elba before being asked to provide naval support during the {{invasion}} and occupation of Genoa. Refitted in January 1820, her square stern was replaced with a circular one, giving her a wider angle of fire and improved protection at the rear. Converted to a corvette in 1831, she returned to the Mediterranean under Lord Paget. From 1852, she became a coal hulk, then a <b>receiving</b> <b>ship</b> before being used as a target for torpedoes and broken up in 1870.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} substantial repairs, Temeraire {{was employed}} blockading the French fleets and supporting British operations off the Spanish coasts. She {{went out to}} the Baltic in 1809, defending convoys against Danish gunboat attacks, and by 1810 was off the Spanish coast again, helping to defend Cadiz against a French army. Her last action was against the French off Toulon, when she came under fire from shore batteries. The ship returned to Britain in 1813 for repairs, but was laid up. She was converted to a prison ship and moored in the River Tamar until 1819. Further service brought her to Sheerness as a <b>receiving</b> <b>ship,</b> then a victualling depot, and finally a guard ship. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1838, and she was towed up the Thames to be broken up.|$|E

5|$|HMS Penelope was a central-battery ironclad {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the late 1860s and was rated as an {{armoured}} corvette. She was designed for inshore work with a shallow draught and this severely compromised her performance under sail. Completed in 1868, the ship spent the next year with the Channel Fleet before she {{was assigned to the}} First Reserve Squadron in 1869 and became the coast guard ship for Harwich until 1887. Penelope was mobilised as tensions with Russia rose during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 and participated in the Bombardment of Alexandria during the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882. The ship became a <b>receiving</b> <b>ship</b> in South Africa in 1888 and then a prison hulk in 1897. She was sold for scrap in 1912.|$|E
5|$|A large repair {{was carried}} out at Plymouth Dock (i.e. Devonport) for the sum of £78,909 between March 1814 and March 1816, but {{with the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars she was laid up for a number of years. Canopus was fitted for sea at Devonport in May 1834, and {{underwent}} further repairs between December 1839 and May 1842. She was prepared for sea again in early 1845, spending time under the command of Fairfax Moresby, before being laid up at Devonport in 1848. She was fitted out there as a <b>receiving</b> <b>ship</b> between June and October 1862, and served as a tender to , the Devonport guardship. Canopus became a mooring hulk in 1869, with her masts being removed in April 1878. She was finally sold after 89 years service with the Royal Navy in October 1887 to J. Pethick, and was broken up.|$|E
5|$|Built {{during the}} American War of Independence {{she spent the}} last three years of the war off the American coast, and saw action at the Battle of Cape Henry and at the Battle of the Chesapeake. The years of peace were spent either in the Caribbean or off Nova Scotia, before the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolutionary Wars saw her commissioned for service in the Leeward Islands and off the British coast. It was while serving in British waters that she became caught up in the mutiny at the Nore. As one of only two two-decker ships to remain in action during the mutiny she had to maintain the Dutch blockade by creating the illusion of being part of a larger fleet, which she managed successfully. Adamant then went on to fight at the Battle of Camperdown, after which she moved to the English Channel, and then the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope. Here she took part in the destruction of the French commerce raider Preneuse, and in her later years captured a number of privateers. She became a <b>receiving</b> <b>ship</b> and flagship of a port admiral during the last years of the Napoleonic Wars, until being broken up in June 1814.|$|E

50|$|On 12 August, Pioneer sortied for the {{invasion}} of southern France. Again minesweepers led the way, clearing the assault area, ignoring shore battery attacks while completing their complex and vital task.

5|$|Her {{career began}} as the {{flagship}} of Rear-Admiral Armand Blanquet du Chayla, {{second in command}} at the Battle of the Nile, where she distinguished herself with her fierce resistance before being forced to surrender with over half her crew dead or wounded, and most of her guns disabled. Taken into British service she was refitted and served as the flagship of several admirals. Commanded by Francis Austen Canopus was Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis's flagship in the Mediterranean under Nelson, and narrowly missed the fighting at Trafalgar. She saw action with Duckworth's fleet at the Battle of San Domingo, and remained with him during the attempt to force the Dardanelles, and the operations {{in support of the}} Alexandria expedition in 1807. She remained active against the French in the Mediterranean {{for the rest of the}} Napoleonic Wars, helping to drive ashore two large French ships of the line in a notable incident in 1809. Canopus remained in service after the end of the wars, serving as a flagship into the mid-nineteenth century, but as sail gave way to steam, she was relegated to support duties in Devonport, becoming a <b>receiving</b> <b>ship,</b> tender and a mooring hulk. She was eventually sold for breaking up in 1887, after nearly ninety years in British service.|$|E
5|$|Penelope was {{completed}} at Devonport Dockyard on 27 June 1868 {{for the cost}} of £196,789 and served in the Channel Fleet until June 1869. She was then guard ship at Harwich until 1882, which included summer cruises in company {{with the rest of the}} reserve fleet. She was part of the Particular Service Squadron mobilised during the Russian war scare of June–August 1878. In 1882, she was at Gibraltar on the summer cruise when the Anglo-Egyptian War began and her shallow draught caused her to be sent to Egypt. Upon arrival in Alexandria, she assisted with the evacuation of European refugees for several days before the bombardment of the city began on 11 July. Penelope was the ship closest to the Egyptian forts and fired 231 rounds during the battle. The ship was only lightly damaged by Egyptian shells, with eight men wounded, one eight-inch gun damaged and one mainyard needing to be replaced. She became Rear-Admiral Anthony Hoskins's flagship when the British seized the Suez Canal to allow their troop transports to land at Ismailia. Penelope returned home after the war for a further five years service at Harwich. She was paid off in 1887, refitted, and sent to Simonstown, South Africa, as a <b>receiving</b> <b>ship</b> the following year. In January 1897, Penelope was converted to a prison-hulk and then sold for scrap on 12 July 1912 for the price of £1,650. The ship was broken up at Genoa, Italy, in 1914.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{remained}} largely inactive in Philadelphia {{for the next}} three years. On 22 January 1917, she became a <b>receiving</b> <b>ship</b> for naval recruits. Alabama was transferred to the southern Chesapeake to begin training recruits in the middle of March. Shortly thereafter, on 6 April, the United States declared war on Germany. Two days later, Alabama became the flagship of the 1st Division, Atlantic Fleet, {{and for the rest of}} the war she continued her training mission of the east coast of the United States. During this period, she made one cruise to the Gulf of Mexico from late June to early July 1918. On 11 November, Germany signed the Armistice that ended the fighting in Europe; Alabama continued training naval recruits, though at a reduced level of intensity. She took part in fleet maneuvers in February and March 1919 in the West Indies before returning to Philadelphia in April for repairs. A summer training cruise for midshipmen from the US Naval Academy followed; Alabama departed Philadelphia on 28 May bound for Annapolis, where she arrived the next day. After taking on a contingent of 184 midshipmen, she steamed out of Annapolis on 9 June. The cruise went to the West Indies and passed through the Panama Canal and back. By mid-July, the ship was cruising off the coast of New England. She returned south in August for maneuvers, and at the end of the month she returned the midshipmen to Annapolis before docking in Philadelphia.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, the Royal Navy housed {{training}} and other support facilities in hulks—old wooden ships of the line—moored in ports as <b>receiving</b> <b>ships,</b> depot ships, or floating barracks. The Admiralty regarded shore accommodation as expensive and liable {{to lead to}} indiscipline. These floating establishments kept their names while the actual vessels housing them changed. For example, the gunnery training school at Portsmouth occupied three ships between its foundation in 1830 and its move ashore in 1891 but all were named (or renamed) HMS Excellent.|$|R
50|$|<b>Receiving</b> <b>ships</b> were {{typically}} older vessels that {{could still be}} kept afloat, but were obsolete or no longer seaworthy. The practice was especially common {{in the age of}} wooden ships, since the old hulls would remain afloat for many years in relatively still waters after they had become too weak to withstand the rigors of the open ocean.|$|R
