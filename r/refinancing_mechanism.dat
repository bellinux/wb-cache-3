40|$|In Germany, {{small firms}} are financed chiefly by small banks, which are grouped into two systems: the savings banks (Sparkassen) and the credit cooperatives. The {{government}} actively supports {{the financing of}} investments in small industry - especially business start-ups. The author explains how small firms are financed in Germany. The author contends that small and meduim-size firms contribute {{a lot to the}} German economy. Small firms are not subject to the control institutions - such as supervisory board seats, proxy voting and equity holdings - that shape the relationships between large firms and large banks. The author also points out that small banks, which are part of a decentralized market structure, over come imperfections in the financial market by building institutions that supersede the market mechanism. The savings bank and credit cooperatives systems have each developed an internal capital, not unlike those within large banks operating nationwide. Only central institutions participate in the domestic money market, to place the system's excess liquidity or to raise funds to cover the systems deficits. Also, the funding programs of the government banks {{can be seen as a}} <b>refinancing</b> <b>mechanism</b> that especially helps small banks. The same is true for rediscountable trade bills.

40|$|Lienau’s book on ‘Rethinking Sovereign Debt’ delves into {{international}} finance {{to shed light}} on its background rules, overarching ideologies and interacting actors, disentangling the social norm of sovereign debt continuity and its institutional foundations. What a formalistic legal reasoning would interpret as a self-contained bilateral contract is then situated in historical time and social space populated by a variety of actors (debtors and creditors), co-existing legal regimes and evolving principles of reference. Her focus on odious debt highlights situations where debt continuity is challenged by major events in the sovereign borrower status (such as major political regime change, corruption and human rights abuse) which challenge debt legitimacy. This comment expands on her thoughtful analysis by linking debt continuity to the borrowing sovereign entity as a going concern. Sovereign borrowing makes lenders involved with this ongoing entity through time and circumstances. Ongoing sovereign debt management is featured by both debt securities market trading and the <b>refinancing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In turn, refinancing involves public finances with their public benefit missions, central banking and the monetary base management. In this context, socially responsible lending and borrowing may be facilitated by acknowledging the bonding relationship between the borrowing sovereign entity and its creditors, including when default occurs...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} link between {{sovereign}} debt and financial sustainability in central governments, clarifying sustainability mechanisms specific to the public sector. They refer to the connection between public debt and the monetary basis, {{as well as the}} general interest missions performed by the public sector to cover collective and long-term obligations and guarantees. By examining matters raised to this specificity, we offer an original position on the financial sustainability of central governments. In recent decades, there has been a trend toward convergence between the private and the public modes of accounting and finance, including related financial sustainability criteria. Financial sustainability of central governments was then allegedly aligned with that of business firms. Our approach argues that some financial mechanisms that {{lie at the heart of}} sustainability of public entities are specific and pertain to the public sector sphere. To illustrate this specificity, three issues are especially addressed: (i) the taxing power; (ii) the public debt management and its <b>refinancing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and (iii) the collective engagement represented by pay-as-you-go pension obligations. A theoretical framework is then developed and corroborated by numerical illustration and case studies in practice and regulation. One case study concerns the sustainability measures adopted under “the Excessive Debt Procedure Criteria” by the European Union (EU), which may show inconsistency between management by financial indicators and sovereign sustainability. Some received questions will be renewed, such as: are sustainability and funding linked? Shall governments fully repay their debt one day? Central government is deemed to be financially sustainable when it can pursue its ongoing public benefit missions while fulfilling its financial obligations when they become due in time and amount. This financial capacity depends on both tax revenues and public debt management. In this context, governmental debt capacity consists in placing sovereign debt for sake of debt issuance and refinancing – with governmental entities, resident and foreign debt-holding investors, monetary financial institutions and central banking. The latter two placements relate to the monetary base management. Financial markets may facilitate some of these ongoing transactions on sovereign debt. Therefore, fiscal policies, welfare policies and public debt management are linked, while governmental debt capacity constitutes an integral part of its financial sustainability...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} economists warned that a {{political}} union was {{a prerequisite for}} a viable currency union. This paper disputes the feasibility of such a political union. A fully fledged federal union, which would likely please peripheral Europe, is impracticable since it implies a degree of fiscal solidarity that does not exist. A Hayekian minimal federal state, which would appeal to core Europe, would be refused by peripheral members, since residual fiscal sovereignty would be surrendered without any clear positive economic and social return. Even an intermediate solution based on coordinated Keynesian policies would be unfeasible, since {{it would be at}} odds with German ‘monetary mercantilism’. The euro area is thus trapped between equally unfeasible political perspectives. In this bleak context, austerity policies are mainly explained by the necessity to readdress the euro area balance-of-payments crisis. This crisis presents striking similarities to traditional financial crises in emerging economies associated with fixed exchange regimes. Therefore, the delayed response of the European Central Bank (ECB) to the sovereign debt crisis cannot be seen as the culprit of the euro area crisis. The ECB’s monetary <b>refinancing</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> Target 2 and the ECB’s belated Outright Monetary Transactions intervention impeded a blow-up of the currency union, but could not solve its deep causes. The current combination of austerity policies and moderate ECB intervention aims to rebalance intra-eurozone foreign accounts and to force competitive deflation strategy...|$|R
