The important causes of air pollution are the <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter, <b>respirable</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. As limited information is available enumerating the effect of these pollutants on liver physiology of the population living near the polluted sites; in the present study, we tried to investigate their effect on liver of the population residing near the oil drilling sites since birth. In this study, a randomly selected 105 subjects (46 subjects from oil drilling site and 61 subjects from control site) aged above 30 years were taken under consideration. The particulate matter as well as the gaseous pollutants, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, were analyzed through a respirable dust sampler. The level of alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase enzymes in serum were measured by spectrophotometer. The generalized regression model studies suggests a higher concentration of <b>respirable</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter, <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter and nitrogen dioxide lowers the alkaline phosphatase level (p< 0. 0001) by 3. 5 times (95 % CI 3. 1 - 3. 9), 1. 5 times (95 % CI 1. 4 - 1. 6) and 12 times (95 % CI 10. 74 - 13. 804), respectively in the exposed group. The higher concentration of <b>respirable</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter and nitrogen dioxide in air was associated with increase in alanine transaminase level (p< 0. 0001) by 0. 8 times (95 % CI 0. 589 - 1. 049) and by 2. 8 times (95 % CI 2. 067 - 3. 681) respectively in the exposed group.

A total of 62 roadside sites in 14 districts covering the most urbanized and densely populated areas were selected.

Further, the air quality studies revealed high <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter as well as <b>respirable</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter in the ambient air of Aizawl. Biomonitoring through plant leaves has been recognized as a recent thrust area {{in the field of}} particulate matter science.

The quantity of <b>respirable</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter and <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter at four different sites were much higher than the prescribed limits of Central Pollution Control Board of India during the summer and winter seasons. The dust deposition of L.  camara leaves was 1. 01  mg/cm 2 and, pertaining to the biochemical parameters: pH was 7. 49; relative water content 73. 74 %; total chlorophyll 1. 91  mg/g; ascorbic acid 7. 06  mg/g; sugar 0. 16  mg/g; protein 0. 67  mg/g; catalase 30. 76  U/mg protein; peroxidase 0. 16  U/mg protein; and air pollution tolerance index was 12. 91.

40|$|Objective: To examine an {{industry}} funded and controlled study of in Right air quality (IFAQ). Methods: Systematic search of internal tobacco industry documents {{available on the}} internet and at the British American Tobacco Guildford Depository. Results: Individuals from several tobacco industry companies, led by Philip Morris, designed, funded, conducted, and controlled the presentation of results of a study of IFAQ for the Scandinavian airline SAS in 1988 while attempting to minimise the appearance of industry control. Industry lawyers and scientists deleted results unfavourable to the industry's position from the study before delivering it to the airline. The published version of the study further downplayed the results, particularly with regard to <b>respirable</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates.</b> The study ignored the health implications of the results and instead promoted the industry position that ventilation could solve problems posed by secondhand smoke. Conclusions: Sponsoring IFAQ studies was one of several tactics the tobacco industry employed in attempts to reverse or delay implementation of in-flight smoking restrictions. As a result, airline patrons and employees, particularly flight attendants, continued to be exposed to pollution from secondhand smoke, especially particulates, which the industry's own consultants had noted exceeded international standards.

This study investigates the feasibility of a screening process for presumptive detection of unrecognised IAQ problems in an indoor environment.

The results show that an RSP objective of < 20 μg/m 3 could be met by removing RSP from both the return air and outdoor air supply simultaneously.

However, technical difficulties have been reported during the full assessment of these pollutants. This study hence investigates the feasibility of a preliminary screening process for presumptive detection of IAQ problems in an air-conditioned environment. Specifically, a simple screening test at certain probability of unsatisfactory IAQ for air-conditioned offices, together with an ‘IAQ index ’ which employs the average fractional dose to certain exposure limits of a few ‘most representative ’ air pollutants (rather {{than all of the}} listed nine) was proposed. This is an alternative for routine inspection in determining the asymptomatic IAQ unsatisfactory for some air-conditioned offices of Hong Kong. And it was evaluated in terms of the test sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. The screening test would be a useful tool for policymakers, building owners and professionals to identify offices with probable IAQ problems and to make decisions on resources for efficient mitigation actions...|$|E
40|$|This substudy of a randomized, controlled, forced switching, open-label, parallel-group {{clinical}} study {{in a total}} of 100 healthy adult male and female smokers compared environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) produced from smoking a second generation electrically heated cigarette smoking system (EHCSS), two conventional cigarettes, and no-smoking. Concentrations of air constituents including <b>respirable</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter (RSP), carbon monoxide (CO), and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) and ETS markers including solanesol-related particulate matter (Sol-PM), ultraviolet absorbing particulate matter (UVPM), fluorescing particulate matter (FPM), nicotine and 3 -ethenylpyridine (3 -EP) were measured in a ventilated, furnished conference room over a period of 2 hours on separate occasions. Except for TVOCs, concentrations of air constituents and ETS markers were reduced by 40 % to more than 90 % when adult smokers were smoking the EHCSS as compared to smoking conventional cigarettes. CO and most ETS marker concentrations were in the same range as no-smoking...|$|R
50|$|Pollution is a {{major concern}} in Patna. According to the CAG report, tabled in the Bihar Legislative Assembly in April 2015, <b>respirable</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter (RSPM) level (PM-10) in Patna was 355, three-and-a-half times higher than the {{prescribed}} limit of 100 micro-gram per cubic metre, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions and construction activities in the city. In May 2014, a World Health Organization survey declared Patna the second most air polluted city in India, only after Delhi, with the survey calculating the airborne particulate matter in the state capital's ambient air (PM-2.5) to be 149 micro-grams, six times more than the safe limit, which is 25 micro-grams. Severe air pollution in the city has caused a rise in pollution-related respiratory ailments, such as lung cancer, asthma, dysentery and diarrhoea. The dense smog in Patna during winter season results in major air and rail traffic disruptions every year.|$|R
25|$|<b>Respirable</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter, of {{less than}} 10 {{micrometers}} (µm) in size, can {{be present in the}} drift from cooling towers. Larger particles above 10µm in size are generally filtered out in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than 10µm, referred to as PM10, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems. Similarly, particles smaller than 2.5µm, (PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung, and very small particles (less than 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Though the total particulate emissions from wet cooling towers with fresh water make-up is much less, they contain more PM10 and PM2.5 than the total emissions from wet cooling towers with sea water make-up. This is due to lesser salt content in fresh water drift (below 2,000ppm) compared to the salt content of sea water drift (60,000ppm).|$|R
