50|$|Yusuf's army ravaged {{the rest}} of Armenia as it {{advanced}} toward Berd Kapoyt (Blue Fortress), where Smbat had taken refuge, and besieged it for some time. Smbat finally decided to surrender himself to Yusuf in 914 in hopes of ending the Arab onslaught; Yusuf, however, showed no compassion toward his prisoner as he brought him to Yernjak, tortured the Armenian king to death, beheaded him, and put the headless body on display on a cross in Dvin. Smbat's contemporary, Hovhannes Draskhanakerttsi, writes that the ground where the crucifix was <b>raised</b> became <b>a</b> <b>site</b> for pilgrimage for both Christians and non-Christians. Information provided by later Armenian authors suggested that Smbat's body was taken down and brought to the monastery at Artsvanist.|$|R
50|$|The idea of {{building}} a second link between Malaysia and Singapore was first raised in July 1980 by then-Menteri Besar of Johor, Othman Saat. Gelang Patah was <b>raised</b> as <b>a</b> viable <b>site</b> due to its distant proximity from Johor Bahru, and the suggestion was raised to tackle growing traffic jams on the causeway.

50|$|The museum {{collection}} has far outgrown {{the capacity of}} the existing buildings so much so that only a small fraction is on display at any point in time. With several ongoing excavations and constant new finds, the issue of relocation to more spacious premises has been <b>raised</b> but <b>a</b> suitable <b>site</b> has yet to be decided on.

40|$|AbstractTo {{explore the}} {{structural}} basis {{required for the}} holoenzyme formation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, we have prepared rabbit anti-peptide antibodies that can block the holoenzyme formation without affecting the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The antibodies were <b>raised</b> against <b>a</b> specific <b>site</b> in the catalytic (C) -subunit, termed IDA (Inter-DFG-APE) region, which lies between the kinase subdomains VII and VIII. Although the C-subunit immunoprecipitated with anti-IDA antibodies could not form a stable complex with regulatory (R) -subunit, it was still susceptible to inhibition by the R-subunit or by PKI, a specific inhibitor peptide containing <b>a</b> pseudosubstrate <b>site.</b> These results indicate that there exists an IDA regionmediated interaction between the R- and C-subunits, which is distinct from that mediated through the substrate site and substrate binding site. In accordance with this idea, association of synthetic IDA peptides with the R-subunit was directly demonstrated by resonance mirror analysis. The calculated association constants of IDA peptides were high enough to suggest a possible involvement of the IDA region in the initial step of holoenzyme formation...|$|R

40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Its primary focus is an impact of ASD {{diagnosis}} on <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child and secondary it also introduces {{the basic principles}} of intervention, which are broadly used in <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with ASD. Literature review part of this thesis defines current approach of ASD. It also describes the impact of impairments in communication, social interaction and imagination on <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with ASD. Important principles of intervention in <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with this diagnosis, which are individualization, structuralization, visualization and motivation, are presented there as well. The second part of this thesis presents a proposal for qualitative research that aims to point out differences between how mothers and fathers accept the diagnosis, perceive the impact on family relationships and use the principles of <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with ASD. Proposed research should provide hypotheses which would serve as a foundation for future research...|$|R

40|$|The {{heterogeneity}} of a pepsin extract of type- 24 M protein (pep M 24) was demonstrated by absorption of type-specific and cross-reactive human antisera with M protein fragments and heterologous serotypes of M proteins, pepsin extract of type- 5 M protein (pep M 5) and pepsin extract of type- 6 M protein (pep M 6). 2 of 12 individuals immunized with pep M 24 developed significant rises in antibody titers against pep M 5 and pep M 6, {{as measured by}} the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The sam individuals also developed opsonic antibodies against type- 6, but not type- 5, streptococci, which suggested the development of cross- protective immunity. Inhibition studies of one of these sera with the heterologous pep M proteins showed that the cross-reactive antibodies against pep M 6 could not be blocked by high concentrations of pep M 24, the immunizing antigen; these antibodies could be blocked, however, by cyanogen bromide-derived peptide fragments of pep M 24, which suggested that the cross-reactive antibody was <b>raised</b> against <b>an</b> inaccessible <b>site(s)</b> in the pep M 24 molecule. Inhibition studies of type-specific immune sera with pep M 24 and peptides derived therefrom indicated that the M protein molecule contained multiple distinct as well as identical type-specific antigenic determinants that are unequally distributed among the seven derived peptide fragments...|$|R
5000|$|Almost {{a century}} after her father founded the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Nancy Susan Reynolds Bagley Verney, his {{youngest}} daughter and last surviving child, decided {{to give back to}} the region of her father's boyhood. In 1969, she deeded Virginia Tech 710 acre of Rock Spring Plantation. In 1980, she deeded them another 7 acre, where Reynolds' childhood home and a continuing education center stand. She created an endowment of $1.7 million to provide cultural programming to the surrounding community, to run a forestry research center on the site, and to fund a scholarship program for Patrick County high school students. She financed this in part by selling her Quarry Farm, designed by architect Frank Forster, in Greenwich, Connecticut, to actor Frank Gorshin in 1977 for $650,000 [...] He would later sell it in 1980 to Diana Ross formerly of the Supremes. She also headed the effort to turn the Virginia farmstead where her father was <b>raised</b> into <b>a</b> historic <b>site.</b> Now called the Reynolds Homestead, it is a State and National Historic Landmark listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
