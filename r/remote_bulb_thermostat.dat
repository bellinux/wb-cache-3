40|$|Anywhere from 20 to 40 billion devices {{connected}} {{by the end}} of the decade. Economic benefits in the trillions of dollars. Projections for the Internet of Things (IoT) vary, depending on how it is defined and the analyst doing the prognosticating, but all agree — it’s going to be huge. Much of the conversation, however, has been around Internet-enabling households with connected refrigerators and light <b>bulbs,</b> <b>thermostats</b> and weight scales. However, there are also plenty of business applications — and many of them are more than theories, or predictions in some-one’s crystal ball. The fact is, the IoT is already here. Unattended, machine-to-machine applications have been part of the Internet fabric for more than 20 years. It has been estimated that more than a billion connected machines and devices are already in use, doing the sorts of tasks that are associated with the IoT. Whether those devices consist of a simple sensor plus a communications uplink, or are built around a fully loaded CPU with a mainstream operating system, they are all IoT. So why all the buzz — and why now? In short, the explosive growth in mobil...|$|R

50|$|A common {{technique}} {{to reduce the}} time-to-response of a thermostat is to mill a slot into the bottom side of a griddle plate and “embed” the <b>thermostat</b> <b>bulb</b> in closer proximity to the griddle surface. This construction reduces the thermostat response time in approximate proportion to {{the distance to the}} griddle surface. Specification sheets or product literature will indicate embedded construction through use of key words like ‘embedded’ or indicate a specific probe proximity to the plate surface that is less than the plate thickness.|$|R
50|$|Snap action {{control systems}} are often run with electricity, where a {{stand-alone}} thermostat {{acting as a}} switch is activated by the capillary <b>bulb</b> fluid. The <b>thermostat</b> switches an electrical signal on-or-off to an associated solenoid valve, controlling gas flow to the burner. This construction allows integration of other control mechanisms into the system, such as pilot flame failure, but {{requires the use of}} components known to be sensitive to high temperatures and water damage. Solenoids and associated wiring are known to degrade over time, even if operating within their design parameters, due to the cumulative effects of thermal cycling and ambient grease and oil coating their surfaces - environmental aspects known to attack the integrity of plastics.|$|R
50|$|Snap action {{thermostats}} are {{the most}} common control used in heavy duty commercial griddles with medium-to-heavy production demands. These controls are called “snap action” because the control mechanism will turn the burner valve or electrical element fully on or completely off, with no modulation or intermediate heat source operation - effectively ‘snapping’ the heat source on or off. While not as responsive as solid state controls, snap action controls can maintain a griddle surface temperature within +/- 15°F (8°C) of set point if the <b>thermostat</b> <b>bulb</b> is embedded assuming a 1-inch (25mm) thick steel plate. This operating temperature range may be pushed to +/- 20 to 25°F (10°C to 13°C) if the probe is bottom mounted due to the additional thermal hysteresis introduced by the plate material.|$|R
5000|$|Thermostats {{are used}} to {{regulate}} the griddle surface around a temperature set point established by the operator. Ranges of operation can {{vary depending on the}} controls used and the construction of the griddle, but [...] is most common.Other than solid state controls, which are very sensitive across their entire range of control, snap-action and modulating (aka - throttling) thermostats have peak sensitivity across the middle two-thirds of their operating range. This can limit their overall performance {{at the low end of}} their temperature spectrum (at or below [...] ). This is due to the nature of the temperature control mechanism, which consists of a fluid-filled bulb (typically an oil) connected to the thermostat control via a long narrow capillary tube. The fluid in the bulb expands and contracts with temperature, activating a control response from the thermostat. There is a time lag between sensing the temperature change from the surface of the griddle plate to the response of the fluid within the <b>bulb,</b> to the <b>thermostat</b> control and turning the heat source on or off, up or down. This lag is referred to as hysteresis, and is a primary aspect of recovery time - an important griddle performance metric.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this article is the {{measurement}} of thermal flow under laboratory conditions. We can define thermal flow as the amount of heat transmitted through the surface of rock over a certain period of time. According to the Atlas of Geothermal Energy the thermal flow ranges from 40 to 120 mW/m 2; {{it is not possible to}} measure directly on the surface of the rock. The conventional method of measurement is the use of separation bar thermic conduction measurement system or to measure the temperature of the rock in two different places at selected underground depth intervals. The method of measurement suggested by us combines these two techniques. The measurement is based on a sample of processed store from the Slovak Academy of Science. This sample represents the rock massiv:The complex model includes:- a heating system to imitate the thermal flow,- an isolation box to maintain stable conditions,- temperature stabilizing components (<b>thermostat,</b> <b>bulbs,</b> electric conductors),- a heat accumulator including a temperature sensor. A special computer program to measure the thermal flow was created using the Borland Delphi 3. 0 programming language. The role of the program is to process extensive data quickly. The results of the measured temperatures and modelled thermal flow are displayed graphically in this article. As seen from the graph, the course of measurement thermal flow is linear. In our geographical location this value is cca 120 m W. m- 2. This value proves, that at the projection physical model we are approximating to the reality in areas of sensitive elements. Another fact is that Joule heat which rose into a heater system of transformer straps under muster would thermal flow 2, 25 W. m- 2. From the present results that by follow the sensitivity measurement scanners it is needed to measure a minimum threefold during a longer time or to improve the sensitivity measurement chains. These measurements and analyses are not sufficient to make a final conclusion. It is necessary to repeat the measurements under real conditions...|$|R
40|$|This thirty-month {{project was}} {{successful}} in attaining its ambitious objectives of demonstrating a radically novel 'remote-phosphor' LED light source that can out-perform conventional conformal coated phosphor LED sources. Numerous technical challenges were met with innovative techniques and optical configurations. This product development program {{for a new generation}} of solid-state light sources has attained unprecedented luminosity (over 1 kilo-lumen) and efficacy (based on the criterion lumens per 100 mw radiant blue). LPI has successfully demonstrated its proprietary technology for optical synthesis of large uniform sources out of the light output of an array of separated LEDs. Numerous multiple blue LEDs illuminate single a phosphor patch. By separating the LEDs from the phosphor, the phosphor and LEDs operate cooler and with higher efficiency over a wide range of operating conditions (from startup to steady state). Other benefits of the system include: better source uniformity, more types of phosphor can be used (chemical interaction and high temperatures are no longer an issue), and the phosphor can be made up from a pre-manufactured sheet (thereby lowering cost and complexity of phosphor deposition). Several laboratory prototypes were built and operated at the expected high performance level. The project fully explored two types of remote phosphor system: transmissive and reflective. The first was found to be well suited for a replacement for A 19 type incandescent bulbs, as it was able to replicate the beam pattern of a traditional filament bulb. The second type has the advantages that it is pre-collimate source that has an adjustable color temperature. The project was divided in two phases: Phase I explored a transmissive design and Phase II of the project developed reflective architectures. Additionally, in Phase II the design of a spherical emitting transmissive <b>remote</b> phosphor <b>bulb</b> was developed that is suitable for replacement of A 19 and similar light bulbs. In Phase II several new reflective remote phosphor systems were developed and patents applied for. This research included the development of reflective systems in which the short-pass filter operated at a nominal incidence angle of 15 {sup o}, a major advancement of this technology. Another goal of the project was to show that it is possible to align multiple optics to multiple LEDs (spaced apart for better thermal management) to within an accuracy in the z-direction of 10 microns or less. This goal was achieved. A further goal was to show it is possible to combine and homogenize the output from multiple LEDs without any flux loss or significant increase in etendue. This goal also was achieved. The following color-coded computer drawing of the Phase 2 reflective remote phosphor prototype gives an idea of the accuracy challenges encountered in such an assembly. The actual setup has less functional clarity due to the numerous items of auxiliary equipment involved. Not only did 10 degrees of freedoms alignment have to be supplied to the LEDs and component prisms as well, but there were also micro-titrating glue dispensers and vacuum hoses. The project also utilized a recently introduced high-index glass, available in small customized prisms. This prototype also embodies a significant advance in thin-film design, by which an unprecedented 98 % single-pass efficiency was attained over a 30 degree range of incidence angle (Patents Pending). Such high efficiency is especially important since it applies to the blue light going to the phosphor and then again to the phosphor's light, so that the 'system' efficiency associated with short-pass filter was 95. 5 %. Other losses have to be kept equally small, towards which a new type of ultra-clear injection-moldable acrylic was discovered and used to make ultra-transparent CPC optics. Several transmissive remote phosphor prototypes were manufactured that could replace screw-in type incandescent bulbs. The CRI of the white light from these prototypes varied from 55 to 93. The system efficiency achieved was between 27 to 29. 5 lumens per 100 mw radiant blue. For blue LEDs providing 200 mw blue for 1 watt electrical input, these prototypes produced 54 to 59 lumens per watt. The latest blue LEDs (from several manufacturers) are more than twice as efficient as this. So in this case the efficiency of the systems (exclusive of driver losses) would be minimally 108 to 118 lumens per watt. So the systems efficiency of the transmissive remote phosphor was proven to be equal to or greater than if the same LEDs use conformal coated phosphor; with the stated advantages of the remote phosphor system...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{temperature}} rise during recent decades (IPCC 2013) is causing permafrost in the Arctic to warm and thaw. This thaw exposes previously frozen soil organic carbon (SOC) to microbial decomposition, generating greenhouse gases methane (CH 4) {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) in a feedback process that leads to further warming and thaw. A growing number of studies model the future permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) to climate warming [Koven et al., 2015, Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015]. However, despite observations of widespread permafrost thaw during recent decades and forecasts of thaw during the next 25 - 100 years [Koven et al., 2015], no research has quantified the PCF for recent decades. This is {{in part due to}} the difficulty of detecting the net movement of old carbon from permafrost to the atmosphere over years and decades amidst large input and output fluxes from ecosystem carbon exchange. In contrast to terrestrial environments, thermokarst lakes provide a direct conduit for processing and emission of old permafrost carbon to the atmosphere, and these emissions are more readily detectable. Results here are based on Walter Anthony et al. [submitted], whereby we quantified the permafrost SOC input to a variety of thermokarst and glacial lakes in Alaska and Siberia in thermokarst zones, defined as areas where land surfaces have transitioned to open lakes due to permafrost thaw during the past 60 years, the historical period most commonly covered by remote-sensing data sets. We also quantified the resulting methane emitted from these active thermokarst lake zones. Using field work, numerical modeling of thaw <b>bulbs,</b> <b>remote</b> sensing and spatial data analysis we will report on the relationship between methane emissions from thermokarst zones and SOC inputs to lakes across gradients of permafrost and climate in Alaska. We will also define the relationship between radiocarbon ages of methane and permafrost soil carbon entering into lakes upon thaw. We will report on the presentday PCF relationship between thaw of permafrost SOC and resulting greenhouse gas release. An extrapolation of our results to the panarctic permafrost region will be presented and compared to permafrost carbon mass balance approaches. The fraction of the terrestrial permafrost carbon pool that has been released as methane from thermokarst along lake margins during the past 60 years will be evaluated relative to early Holocene thermokarst lake emissions and projected permafrost carbon emissions by year 2100. The data will be placed in the context of large regional temperature increases in the Arctic, up to 7. 5 °C by 2100, and thicker, organic-rich Holocene-aged deposits subject to thaw and aerobic decomposition as active layer deepens. We will report on the inflection of large permafrost carbon emissions that is imminently expected to occur and whether or not it has commenced. References: Koven, C. D.; Schuur, E. A.
