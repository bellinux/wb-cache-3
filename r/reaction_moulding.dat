The technique is based on polymer UV <b>reaction</b> <b>moulding</b> using a modified contact mask aligned where mask and wafer are replaced by the replication tool and an arbitrary substrate, respectively.

The replication masters are nickel shims, etched Silicon wafers or uv-transparent fused silica tools. The latter ones allow for replication on opaque substrates. Additionally, polymer elements with unique properties can be obtained by the combination of replication and resist technology using partially transparent replication tools. Wafer scale hybrid integration of microoptical subsystems is accomplished by replication of polymer elements like lenses, lens arrays, micro prisms etc. onto semiconductor wafers containing detectors or VCSELs, or by combini ng microoptical elements on both sides of a glass wafer. The use of thin layers of uv cured (crosslinked) polymers on inorganic substrates results in good thermal and mechanical stability compared to all-polymer devices...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} fluid {{viscoelasticity}} on {{the expansion of}} gas bubbles in polymer foams for both non-reactive and reactive polymers are investigated. Polymer foams are used extensively in consumer products, from car parts to upholstery. They are produced either by injection moulding (of non-reactive polymeric fluids) or <b>reaction</b> injection <b>moulding.</b> We use standard rheological models (Oldroyd B and Pompom) to investigate bubble growth driven by gas diffusion {{as a model for}} injection <b>moulding.</b> To model <b>reaction</b> injection <b>moulding,</b> we develop a new fluid model based on existing linear theory for a gelling liquid. In this case gas is produced as a by-product of the polymer reaction. At small bubble volume fractions gas bubbles remain spherical and isolated from neighbouring bubbles during expansion. In this regime we demonstrate the effects of rheology and gelation on the bubble growth. At high bubble volume fractions neighbouring bubbles compete for the available gas and become distorted in shape. The effects of viscoelasticity on the expansion of gas bubbles arranged in a two-dimensional hexagonal array in a non-reacting polymeric fluid are investigated. In addition to a full finite element calculation of the two-dimensional flow, two one-dimensional approximations valid in the limits of small and large gas area fractions are presented. We show that these approximations give accurate predictions of the evolution of the bubble area, but give less accurate predictions of the bubble shape. Finally we consider how bubbles of different sizes evolve in an expanding foam. We illustrate how the surface tension driven phenomenon known as Ostwald Ripening causes large bubbles to grow at the expense of smaller ones. For the case of bubbles of two different sizes we examine the effects of viscoelasticity on the shapes of the bubbles within the structure and show that viscoelasticity has a different effect on the bubble size distribution depending upon the initial geometry.

50|$|The {{reacting}} {{system is}} formulated {{in such a}} way that two components need to be mixed at equal volume (1:1 ratio). Both components contain mainly DCPD with some additional additives. The difference between both components is crucial, but constitutes only a small fraction of the total formulation: the catalyst system is divided into two parts, each part going into a separate component. When both components are mixed, the complete catalyst system is recombined and becomes active. This is an important difference from other <b>Reaction</b> Injection <b>Moulding</b> (RIM) systems like polyurethane, since the reaction is not stoichiometric. The 1:1 ratio for DCPD moulding is not critical since this is not a combination of two different chemical elements to form a specific matrix. Significant changes in ratio will slow down the system's reactivity because fewer active reaction nuclei are being formed. This also changes the final properties somewhat. The current industrial pumps used on RIM equipment are accurate enough to ensure that the mixing ratio stays within the necessary limits.|$|R

The extent of the <b>reaction</b> between the <b>mould</b> hot face and the molten metal has been studied by varying parameters such as soaking temperature and mould hot face composition, and examining their effects on the <b>reaction</b> with the <b>mould.</b> An increase in the soaking temperature had an effect on the alpha case, both in appearance and hardness, but had no effect on contamination levels by carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen.

The micro-hardness profiles provided insight into the effect of the alpha case on the mechanical properties of the Ti- 64 alloy by displaying hardness values of 1000 HV 0. 1 and above, but could not be solely utilized to determine the alpha case penetration depth due to microstructural differences in the unaffected Ti- 64, in particular the martensitic microstructure that formed with a fast cooling rate from a higher temperature.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{interest}} {{has grown in}} the use of composite components within the automotive industry. Fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) components are of particular interest to the industry, since lower tooling costs and part consolidation can be utilised, whilst lighter, stiffer components can be produced. Several methods are available to produce FRP components at high volumes, including compression moulding (using dough and sheet <b>moulding</b> compounds), reinforced <b>reaction</b> injection <b>moulding</b> (RRIM) and liquid moulding processes (resin transfer moulding (RTM) and structural <b>reaction</b> injection <b>moulding</b> (SRIM)). RTM is a closed mould process, which is widely used to produce components economically in low volumes using matched moulds to produce two good surfaces. The absence of a high volume manufacturing technology, however, has impeded the acceptance and advance of RTM within the automotive industry. A research programme was established at the University of Nottingham to address the problems {{associated with the use of}} RTM for high volume manufacture. This programme has considered the topics of process technology, processing characteristics of polyester resin systems and fibre preforms, fibre wet-out and interfacial bonding, mould design, microwave pre-heating of reactive resin systems and process modelling. This thesis concerns the research which was undertaken to identify the causes of void formation during the impregnation and polymerisation stages of RTM, and methods of reducing the final void content within the component. The impregnation phase of the RTM process was identified as being the stage where the majority of voids were formed. A study of oil impregnation (having a similar viscosity to that of resin) into reinforcement was undertaken to determine the reasons for uneven flow and air entrapment. The dry reinforcements were studied to assess the microstructure of the preforms in order to determine reasons for obstruction of the resin flow. Fabric stitching, thermoplastic binder and size deposits were identified as potential causes of flow impediment. Fibre orientation and preform stacking were also assumed to assist in the development of uneven flow, leading to air entrapment. A major factor determining the formation of microvoids within fibre bundles was identified as the transverse impregnation of resin into high Tex fibre bundles. The major moulding process variables of injection pressure, vent pressure, fibre volume fraction, mould temperature and resin pre-heating have been assessed, to determine their effect on the void content within unidirectional and CFRM reinforced polyester laminates. It was observed that vacuum assistance during impregnation reduced void formation, although higher exotherm pressures and the possibility of monomer boiling arise from its use. A simple impregnation model was developed to assess the microscopic impregnation rates between fibre bundles, in the capillary between fibres and transversely into fibre bundles. The results from this model were compared with actual moulding histories. The findings of the overall work are discussed and suggestions proposed for the reduction of void content in RTM automotive components...|$|R

40|$|Recurrent airway {{obstruction}} (RAO) is {{a common}} condition in stabled horses characterised by small airway inflammation, airway neutrophilia and obstruction following exposure of susceptible horses to mouldy hay and straw and is thus regarded as a hypersensitivity <b>reaction</b> to <b>mould</b> spores. However, the role of IgE-mediated reactions in RAO remains unclear. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate with a serological IgE ELISA test (Allercept), an in vitro sulfidoleukotriene (sLT) release assay (CAST) and with intradermal testing (IDT) whether serum IgE and IgE-mediated <b>reactions</b> against various <b>mould,</b> mite and pollen extracts are associated with RAO. IDT reactions were evaluated at different times in order to detect IgE-mediated immediate type reactions (type I hypersensitivity reactions, 0. 5 - 1 h), immune complex-mediated late type reactions (type III reactions, 4 - 10 h) and cell-mediated delayed type reactions (type IV hypersensitivity reactions 24 - 48 h). In the serological test, overall the control horses displayed more positive reactions than the RAO-affected horses but the difference was not significant. Comparison of the measured IgE levels showed that the RAO-affected horses had slightly higher IgE levels against Aspergillus fumigatus than controls (35 and 16 AU, respectively, p< 0. 05), but all values were below the cut off (150 AU) of the test. In the sLT release assay, seven positive reactions were observed in the RAO-affected horses and four in the controls but this difference was not significant. A significantly higher proportion of late type IDT reactions was observed in RAO-affected horses compared to controls (25 of 238 possible reactions versus 12 of 238 possible reactions, respectively, p< 0. 05). Interestingly, four RAO-affected but none of the control horses reacted with the recombinant mould allergen A. fumigatus 8 (rAsp f 8, p< 0. 05), but only late phase and delayed type reactions were observed. In all three tests the majority of the positive reactions was observed with the mite extracts (64 %, 74 % and 88 % of all positive reactions, respectively) but none of the tests showed a significant difference between RAO-affected and control animals. Our findings do not support that IgE-mediated reactions are important in the pathogenesis of RAO. Further studies are needed to investigate whether sensitisation to mite allergens is of clinical relevance in the horse and to understand the role of immune reactions against rAsp f 8...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium - lithium alloys are {{specialist}} alloys used {{exclusively by}} the aerospace industry. They have properties that are favourable {{to the production}} of modern military aircraft. The addition of approximately 2. 5 percent lithium to aluminium increases the strength characteristics of the new alloys by 10 percent. The same addition has the added advantage of decreasing the density of the resulting alloy by a similar percentage. The disadvantages associated with this alloy are primarily price and castability. The addition of 2. 5 weight percent lithium to aluminium results in a price increase of 100 % explaining the aerospace exclusivity. The processability of the alloys is restricted to ingot casting and wrought treatment but for complex components precision casting is required. Casting the alloys into sand and investment moulds creates a metal - <b>mould</b> <b>reaction,</b> the consequences of which are intolerable in the production of military hardware. The primary object of this project was to investigate and characterise the reactions occurring between the newly poured metal and surface of the mould and to propose a method of counteracting the metal - <b>mould</b> <b>reaction.</b> The constituents of standard sand and investment moulds were pyrolised with lithium metal in order to simplify the complex in-mould reaction and the products were studied by the solid state techniques of powder X-Ray diffraction and magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results of this study showed that the order of reaction was: Organic reagents> > Silicate reagents> Non silicate reagents Alphaset and Betaset were the two organic binders used to prepare the sand moulds throughout this project. Studies were carried out to characterise these resins {{in order to determine the}} factors involved in their reaction with lithium. Analysis revealed that during the curing process the phenolic hydroxide groups are not reacted out and that a redox reaction takes place between these hydroxides and the lithium in the molten alloys. Casting experiments carried out to assess the protection afforded by various hydroxide protecting agents showed that modern effective, protecting chemicals such as bis-trimethyl silyl acetamide and hexamethyldisilazane did not inhibit the metal - <b>mould</b> <b>reaction</b> to a sufficiently high standard and that tri-methylchlorosilane was consistently the best performer. Tri-methyl chlorosilane has a simple functionalizing mechanism compared to other hydroxide protecting reagents and this factor is responsible for its superior inhibiting qualities. Comparative studies of 6 Li and 7 Li N. M. R. spectra (M. A. S. and `off angle') establish that, for solid state (and even solution) analytical purposes 6 Li is the preferred nucleus. 6 Li M. A. S. N. M. R. spectra were obtained for thermally treated laponite clay. At temperatures below 800 oC both dehydrated and rehydrated samples were considered. The data are consistent with mobility of lithium ions from the trioctahedral clay sites at 600 oC. The superior resolution achievable in 6 Li M. A. S. N. M. R. is demonstrated in the analysis of a microwave prepared lithium exchanged clay where 6 Li spectroscopy revelaed two lithium sites in comparison to 7 Li M. A. S. N. M. R. which gave only a single lithium resonance...|$|R
