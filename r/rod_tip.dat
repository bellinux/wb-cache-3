25|$|Beginners tend {{to point}} with the rod {{to where they}} want to throw, but the {{movement}} of the hand has to be a controlled speed-up and then come to an abrupt stop. The rod will then start to unfurl and the tip of the rod will reach a high speed in the required direction. The high speed of the <b>rod</b> <b>tip</b> toward the target gives the impulse to make the cast, the abrupt stop and retreat of the <b>rod</b> <b>tip</b> is essential for the formation of a loop. Experienced fishermen also improve the speed of the line leaving the <b>rod</b> <b>tip</b> by a technique called hauling, applying a quick fast pull with the hand holding the line. At the end of the cast when the line is stretched the line as a whole will still have speed and the fisherman can let some extra line through their fingers making a false throw, either forward or backward or to finish the cast and start fishing.|$|E

25|$|When {{actively}} fishing, the angler {{may want}} to keep the fly line lightly pressed against the rod handle with the index finger of the casting arm. The free arm is used to pull line from the reel or to retrieve line from the water. If a fish strikes, the angler can pinch the line with the index finger against the rod handle and lift the <b>rod</b> <b>tip,</b> setting the hook.|$|E
25|$|The {{physics of}} flycasting can be {{described}} by the transfer of impulse, the product of mass and speed through the rod from base to top and from the transfer of impulse through the fly line {{all the way to}} the tip of the leader. Because both the rod and the fly line are tapered the smaller amount of mass will reach high speeds as the waves in rod and line unfurl. The waves that travel through the fly line are called loops. Determining factors in reaching the highest speeds are the basal frequency of a rod and the transfer of the speed from the tip of the rod to the fly line. At the moment the <b>rod</b> <b>tip</b> reaches its highest velocity the direction of the cast is determined.|$|E
2500|$|The type of cast {{used when}} fishing varies {{according}} to the conditions. The most common cast is the forward cast, where the angler whisks the fly into the air, back over the shoulder until the line is nearly straight, then forward, using primarily the forearm. The objective of this motion is to [...] "load" [...] (bend) the <b>rod</b> <b>tip</b> with stored energy, then transmit that energy to the line, resulting in the fly line (and the attached fly) being cast for an appreciable distance. However, just bending the rod and releasing it to jerk the fly line forward (like a bowstring or a catapult) will not propel the fly line and fly very far. More important is {{the movement of the}} rod through an arc acting as a lever, magnifying the hand movement of the caster (of about a foot) to an arc at the <b>rod</b> <b>tip</b> of several feet. Here the rod acts as a lever. In fact, one of the Class 3 types of lever, where The force is applied between the fulcrum and the load (like tweezers). The fulcrum in the fly cast is below the caster's hand gripping the rod; the load is at the rod tip; between the hand exerts the force. The caster's [...] "stroke" [...] backwards and forwards, for the backcast and the forward cast, operates the rod as a (slightly flexible) lever. Casting without landing the fly on the water is known as 'false casting', and may be used to pay out line, to dry a soaked fly, or to reposition a cast. Other casts are the roll cast, the single- or double-haul, the tuck cast, and the side- or curve-cast.|$|E

2500|$|Ultra-light {{spinning}} and casting rods are generally shorter ( [...] is common) lighter, and more limber than normal <b>rods.</b> <b>Tip</b> actions vary from slow to fast, depending upon intended use. These rods usually carry 1 to 6 pound (4.5 to 27N) test fishing line. Some ultra-light rods {{are capable of}} casting lures as light as 1/64th of an ounce (0.4g) – typically small spinners, wet flies, crappie jigs, tubes, or bait such as trout worms. Originally produced to bring more excitement to the sport, ultra-light spin fishing is now widely used for crappie, trout, bass, bluegill ,Roach, Perch, Bream,Pumpkin-seed, Tench {{and other types of}} pan fish.|$|R
2500|$|Dropping the fly {{onto the}} water and its {{subsequent}} movement on or beneath the surface is one of fly fishing's most difficult aspects; the angler is attempting to cast {{in such a way}} that the line lands smoothly on {{the water and}} the fly appears as natural as possible. At a certain point, if a fish does not strike, depending upon the action of the fly in the wind or current, the angler picks up the line to make another presentation. On the other hand, if a fish strikes, the angler pulls in line while raising the <b>rod</b> <b>tip.</b> This [...] "sets" [...] the hook in the fish's mouth. The fish is played either by hand, where the angler continues to hold the fly line in one hand to control the tension applied to the fish, or by reeling up any slack in the line and then using the hand to act as a drag on the reel. Most modern fly reels have an adjustable, mechanical drag system to control line tension during a fish's run.|$|E
2500|$|Dry {{fly fishing}} on small, clear-water streams can be {{especially}} productive if the angler stays as {{low to the ground}} and as far from the bank as possible, moving upstream with stealth. Trout tend to face upstream and most of their food is carried to them on the current. For this reason, the fish's attention is normally focused into the current; most anglers move and fish [...] "into the current", fishing from a position downstream of the fish's suspected lie. Trout tend to strike their food at current [...] "edges", where faster- and slower-moving waters mix. Obstructions to the stream flow, such as large rocks or nearby pools, provide a [...] "low energy" [...] environment where fish sit and wait for food without expending much energy. Casting upstream to the [...] "edge" [...] of the slower water, the angler can see the fly land and drift slowly back downstream. The challenge in stream fishing is placing the fly with deadly accuracy, within inches of a protective rock for instance, not long range casting. Done properly, the fly seems to be just floating along in the current with a [...] "perfect drift" [...] as if not connected to the fly line. The angler must remain vigilant for the [...] "take" [...] in order to be ready to raise the <b>rod</b> <b>tip</b> and set the hook.|$|E
2500|$|Once hooked, a small trout can {{be easily}} {{retrieved}} [...] "on the reel" [...] or by simply pulling in the fly line with the reel hand while pinching {{the line between the}} rod handle and the index finger of the rod hand. It is important to keep the <b>rod</b> <b>tip</b> high, allowing the bend of the rod to absorb the force of the fish's struggles against the line. Larger trout will often take line in powerful runs before they can be landed. Unlike spin fishing where the line is already on the reel, playing a large fish with fly line and a fly reel can present a special challenge. Usually, when a fish is hooked, there will be extra fly line coiled between the reel and the index finger of the rod hand. The challenge is to reel up the loose fly line onto the reel without breaking off a large fish (or getting the line wrapped up around the rod handle, one's foot, a stick or anything else in the way). With experience, really large trout can be put on the reel simply by applying light pressure on the outgoing line using the fisher's fingers. Once the extra line is on the reel, an angler can use the reel's drag system to tire the fish. It is important to use heavier tippet material if it won't spook the fish. The reason why this is important is an exhausted fish can easily die if released too soon. Heavier tippet material enables the angler to land the fish while not over exhausting it.|$|E
40|$|To analyse {{transport}} effects at {{the control}} <b>rod</b> <b>tips</b> {{in a nuclear}} reactor the more accurate SP 3 approximation for neutron transport is compared to the usually applied mulitigroup diffusion equations. This has been done as a master thesis project at Studsvik Scandpower, and a previously two-dimensional solution method for SP 3 theory has been generalised to three-dimensions and implemented in a independent code. Computations for one- to three-dimensional systems have been done and the results given for diffusion theory and SP 3 theory compared. The thesis work has indicated that there are possible differences between the diffusion and SP 3 solutions in an non-neglectable magnitude for computations in three-dimensions but with generally no negative implications in regards to reactor safety and fuel pin integrity. For the analysed partial cores the diffusion solution over estimated the power at and around control <b>rod</b> <b>tips</b> with around 2 - 8 % compared to the SP 3 solution. Further studies {{will be necessary to}} show that this is the case in general as only a limited amount of cases was analysed. This order of magnitude is relatively large in comparison to the expected difference between diffusion theory and actual measurements in a real reactor. These usually differ by {{no more than a few}} percent. The exact order of magnitude for an actual nuclear reactor is not possible to determine with the partial cores and the code developed. For this a more sophisticated code computing with or without SP 3 for a complete core would be necessary...|$|R

Make sure you're facing downstream with the <b>rod</b> <b>tip</b> pointing down or the rod just off the water level. 3. Hold the lower grip of the rod with your hand {{that is on the}} downstream side (your left hand); the right hand is on the upper grip. 4. Lift the rod up at a steady pace so almost all of the line in the river is {{out of the water and}} being brought up towards you, and gently rotate your body to face more across the river & towards your target of the cast.5. As you lift the line with the above move, this is followed by gently dropping the <b>rod</b> <b>tip</b> down in a small arc as you lift it upstream, and smoothly pull the rod up and upstream at the same time.6. The end of the fly line, the nylon leader and the fly should come back upstream towards you, and you should aim for the fly and some of the leader to gently kiss the water about a rod length out in the river and a little upstream of your casting position; right before the fly kisses the water, raise the <b>rod</b> <b>tip</b> as if you were going to make a roll cast, and make a powerful forward stroke in the direction you are facing out across the river.7. You should be able to achieve and angle change (the angle between where the fly line ended up downstream before the next cast, and where you want to cast to target) of around 45 degrees with ease. 8. As you make the forward casting stroke, the upper hand (right hand in this case) will push the rod and tip forwards towards the target, and the aerialised loop of line (from the <b>rod</b> <b>tip</b> to the water) will then be re-energised in the new direction of the casting stroke. The fly line will then progress over the river, unfurling the energised loop (the D Loop) as it goes, and the line, leader and the fly should end up towards the other side of the river (target).|$|E

30|$|We {{propose a}} novel mirror-image nanoepsilon (MINE) {{structure}} to achieve highly localized and enhanced near field at its gap and systematically investigate its plasmonic behaviors. The MINE {{can be regarded}} as a combination of two fundamental plasmonic nanostructures: a nanorod dimer and nanoring. By adapting a nanoring surrounding a nanorod dimer structure, the nanorod is regarded as a bridge pulling the charges from the nanoring to the nanorod, which induces stronger plasmon coupling in the gap to boost local near-field enhancement. Two resonance peaks are identified as the symmetric and anti-symmetric modes according to the symmetries of the charge distributions on the ring and rod dimer in the MINE. The symmetric mode in the MINE structure is preferred because its charge distribution leads to stronger near-field enhancement with a concentrated distribution around the gap. In addition, we investigate the influence of geometry on the optical properties of MINE structures by performing experiments and simulations. These results indicate that the MINE possesses highly tunable optical properties and that significant near-field enhancement at the gap region and <b>rod</b> <b>tips</b> can be realized by the gap and lightning-rod effects. The results improve understanding of such complex systems, and it is expected to guide and facilitate the design of optimum MINE structures for various plasmonic applications.|$|R
