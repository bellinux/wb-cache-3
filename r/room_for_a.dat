5|$|In 1867 the Cambridge and Colchester {{branch line}} of the Great Eastern Railway was built through the castle, cutting across and largely {{destroying}} the inner bailey {{in order to make}} <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new station.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the lower Hill District, an area {{inhabited}} predominantly {{by people of}} African descent, was completely destroyed. Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain, forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 black families, 312 white), to make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cultural center that included the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961. Other than one apartment building, {{none of the other}} buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built.|$|E
5|$|Initial works {{commenced}} in August 2007, when Pastasentralen was demolished to make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> temporary {{bus terminal}} {{that would allow}} Kaigaten to be closed for construction. Contracts for building the line were awarded to Svein Boasson, NCC Construction, Fyllingen Maskinstasjon and Veidekke Entreprenør. The contract for laying the tracks was awarded to Baneservice.|$|E
5|$|On May 31, 2013, it was {{announced}} that Sandstorm would close on June 2 to make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new attraction. About two weeks later, on June 11, Busch Gardens Tampa announced plans for Falcon's Fury and construction began that month. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the park drove steel piles for the ride's foundation nightly for about a month.|$|E

5|$|The Alan B. Shepard Civic Center ("The Dome"), a {{significant}} {{building in the}} city's history, was constructed in 1958, and was dedicated to the career of former Virginia Beach resident and astronaut Alan Shepard. As the area changed, the Dome was frequently used as a bingo hall. The building was razed in 1994 to make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> municipal parking lot and potential future development.|$|E
5|$|The King's Cross fire in 1987 {{started in}} the machine <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wooden {{escalator}} between the main line station and the London Underground station's Piccadilly line platforms. The escalator burnt up {{and much of the}} tube station caught fire with smoke spreading to the main line station, killing 31 people.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} was converted into {{housing in the}} 1950s, and in May 1970 the station building was demolished to make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new bus station. The cargo building was refurbished {{to serve as a}} station building for passengers and as offices. The wharf was sold by the municipality in 1987, and the last train to serve the station departed on 31 December 1990. Most of the line and infrastructure is however intact.|$|E

5|$|While {{entering}} the landing pattern, crash trucks would {{travel to the}} runway and await landing. This was standard procedure for all Head Start landings. After landing, the crew was interrogated prior to being released, so that maintenance, intelligence, and other crews could be alerted {{to the performance of}} the plane and other items that the crew might have noticed during their flight. After release, they would typically go to the Physical Conditioning <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> steam bath and rubdown.|$|E
5|$|A full upgrade of {{the station}} {{was carried out in}} 1987. A main {{incentive}} was that the Norwegian Public Roads Administration wanted the station building removed to make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new interchange towards Jar. Therefore, Kielland's station building was demolished in 1987. The new station building, designed by NSB Arkitektkontor and Arne Henriksen, was built in glass and concrete with a dominant portal presenting the staircases. On the island platform a new ticket booth was built in steel and glass. The platform was covered by a roof of laminated wood and plywood held up by galvanized steel columns. The roof followed the shape of the curved platform and featured a gable.|$|E
5|$|After Groundskeeper Willie {{takes away}} Bart's {{skateboard}} for destroying his leaf pile, Bart fills up Willie's shack with creamed corn {{as he is}} sleeping, destroying it. As Willie is taken away for medical attention, he swears revenge on Bart. Meanwhile, Krusty the Clown's show comes under criticism by the Federal Communications Commission for not being educational enough for children. The Channel 6 executive proposes that Krusty cut ten minutes from his three-hour show to make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> kids' news program, Kidz News, where children deliver and report news items. Lisa is recruited as a news anchor along with other Springfield Elementary School children. Bart is not chosen at first, but is made sportscaster after he complains to Marge.|$|E

5|$|Bergen Street is {{laid out}} similar to other subway {{stations}} located below narrow streets, with two levels. The upper level—the only one used in regular service—serves local trains, while the lower level has formerly seen express service. As {{a result of the}} station's proximity to ground level, there is no <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> mezzanine, making it one of only three as-built express stations in the system that do not allow free transfers between directions. As a result passengers wishing to transfer from a Brooklyn-bound G to a Manhattan-bound F, and vice versa, cannot do so at this station.|$|E
5|$|From the 12th {{century the}} manor of Muchland was {{administered}} from Aldingham Castle. Muchland {{became known as}} Aldingham manor and in 1291 it came into the ownership of the Harrington family. In the 14th century, the Scots attacked the Furness peninsula during the Scottish Wars of Independence; {{around the same time}} coastal erosion threatened Aldingham Motte. These factors may have led to the Harrington family abandoning Aldingham and establishing the administrative centre of the manor at the newly built Gleaston Castle, though the construction work could have been the result of their growing social status, and they may have needed more <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> greater number of servants.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde {{reflects}} a more humorous world-view than Boccaccio's poem. Chaucer {{does not have}} his own wounded love to display and therefore allows himself an ironic detachment from events and Criseyde is more sympathetically portrayed. In contrast to Boccaccio's final canto, which returns to the poet's own situation, Chaucer's palinode has Troilus looking down laughing from heaven, finally aware of the meaninglessness of earthly emotions. About {{a third of the}} lines of the Troilus are adapted from the much shorter Il Filostrato, leaving <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more detailed and characterised narrative.|$|E

5|$|Greer Stadium's {{original}} scoreboard was a black, non-descript, rectangular {{unit with}} a two line reader panel. In 1985, it {{was moved to}} beside the left field foul pole to make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new rectangular 4-line scoreboard 10 feet (3m) high with a fully animated reader panel. The original unit was then used as an out-of-town scoreboard, displaying the scores of other baseball games. When the guitar display was installed in 1993, the original scoreboard was removed and replaced by the second scoreboard, which became the new out-of-town board. From 2008 to 2014, the out-of-town scoreboard {{was not used to}} display scores; instead it was used only as a support for additional advertising signage.|$|E
5|$|Many {{artefacts}} {{are displayed}} at the Mutsu Memorial Museum in Tōwa-chō. This is a successor to a local museum funded by the town of Suō-Ōshima which opened in July 1970. To make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new road, this museum was moved in April 1994 to a new building. Since 1963, a memorial service has been held here every year on 8 June in honour of the crew. A very {{large portion of the}} bow was located at Suo-Oshima until at least 2012, but it may have been moved or lost.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, TGS star Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) {{dressing}} room {{is now a}} temporary <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> technician (Meng Ai) as Jack is renting space on the TGS floor in the 30 Rock building to keep the budget down, as a result Jenna is forced to share a {{dressing room}} with her TGS co-star Danny Baker (Cheyenne Jackson). Immediately, the two start behaving like an old married couple. NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) gets upset about Jenna and Danny fighting and decides to stop their bickering. Kenneth interrupts one of their arguments by showing them a childish picture he drew of the two. This works to no avail as Jenna and Danny continue arguing. To {{put a stop to}} this, Danny moves out from his dressing room and into the Y.|$|E
