40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of the saturable reactor on the reverse recovery process. This was done by PSPICE (MicroSim Inc.) simulation of an equivalent circuit that represents the problem on hand including a qualitative account of all major losses. The simulation results that were verified by experimental results. point out to the merit of connecting a bypass resistor in parallel with the saturable reactor. The simulation methodology developed in the paper could be helpful in studying other reverse recovery problems. I. INTRODUCI 10 N Auxiliary-switch assisted soft switchers were shown to retain the desirable characteristics of PWM converters with relatively minor penalty for the soft commutations gained. The soft switching strategy (Fig. 1) proposed in [1] offers an optimal design of the auxiliary switch circuitry by decoupling the extra capacitance (Cr 1), needed to achieve ZVS at turn off, from the turn on snubber (Lr and Q 2). Consequently, the energy stored in Cr 2 does not funnel into the <b>resonance</b> <b>inductor</b> (Lr), averting thereby the problem of large peak currents through the auxiliary switch. A thorough analysis of the switcher of Fig. 1 [2] shows that this strategy ensures soft switching of all power devices leaving but one problem: the reverse recovery of diodes D 2 and D 3. The problem arises at the end of the discharge cycle of Lr (Fig. 2 a) due the snapping of the reverse current through these diodes. This difficulty could be alleviated by introducing a saturable reactor (SR) in series with Lr to block the reverse current of the diodes (Fig. 2 b). However, the design of the SR is far from being simple since it has to accommodate conflicting objectives: low overall losses, low SR losses (to prevent overheating of the small device), and fast discharge of the Lr- Ls assembly...|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} size of inductors in resonant converters {{was examined}} {{in terms of}} inductor to transformer size ratio. Following the general discussion of the issue, the inductor size in series resonant DC-DC converter is examined in detail. It is shown that the inductor to transformer size ratio {{is a function of}} the peak voltage of the inductor to the rms voltage of the transformer and is independent of the inductance. The physical size of the inductor could be much larger than the transformer when the converter operates near resonance. Away from <b>resonance,</b> the <b>inductor</b> size becomes close to, and even smaller, than the transformer. Leakage inductance of the transformer can be used as the resonant inductance but if the leakage is associated with the secondary windings of the transformer, it will increase the peak reverse voltage of the rectifier diodes when a center-tapped rectifier topology is used. To solve this problem, an integrated transformer-inductor element with high primary leakag [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Miniaturization of {{electronic}} gadgets and rapid development of technology have placed novel challenges {{in front of}} power design engineers for an efficient delivery of power at high power density. Next generation microprocessors will require a reductionin power consumption which will result in lower supply voltages for these microprocessors. Thus, power conversion will be guided by objectives such as low voltage, high power density, and high current and high efficiency. To fulfil the requirement of smaller size units {{as a result of}} technology scaling, high operating frequencies is the need of the hour. But such high frequencies bring forth the problem of increased switching losses. In this work, a simple buck converter with soft switching ZCS topology in full wave mode which includes a <b>resonance</b> circuit of <b>inductor</b> and a capacitor is proposed to optimize efficiency and reduce switching loss at a very high operating frequency. As high frequency operation is commanded, the size and weight of the power supply unit practically gets reduced and thus it becomes a better candidate for portable electronics equipment and personal digital assistants (PDAs). Also extended battery life which is a must for such handheld gadgets is directly dependent on the efficiency of the power conversion. Hence, a high efficiency circuit is expected to meet the ends. The system analysis for ZCS full wave mode is presented. Its advantage over the traditional hard switched PWM converter is well shown. The mathematical modeling of the configuration along with its modes of operation is described extensively. The feasibility of this circuit is supported by simulation results...|$|R
40|$|LCL-filters are {{preferred}} over conventional L-filters for grid-connected {{voltage source}} inverters (VSI) {{due to their}} superior harmonic attenuation, smaller filter size and weight. The LCL-filter design process is complex and takes an iterative approach due to the coherence between the filter parameters and design requirements. The main aim of this thesis is to analyse different design variables that contribute to an efficient LCL-filter. The study carried out, falls under two sections. The first study {{was to understand the}} importance of ratio between the grid-side and inverter-side <b>inductors,</b> <b>resonance</b> frequency, reactive power production and attenuation of higher order harmonics in an LCL-filter. Based on the analysis, this thesis proposes a generalised LCL-filter design algorithm which avoids uncertainty in determining resonance frequency as the exact position of the resonance frequency is determined based on the design requirements. The proposed design method considers the LCL-filter as a single filtering unit rather than individual filtering contributions from passive components. The second study is extended to understand the limits of passive components based on the reactive power production limits (based on control structure), IEEE- 519 harmonic limitations and the allowable switching losses or voltage drop across the entire filter. Based on the analysis, the thesis proposes an optimum operating point for an LCL-filter where the minimum inductance is realised to meet IEEE- 519 harmonic current limitations for a given reactive power production while ensuring reasonable switching losses. Simulations and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed two methods in terms of total harmonic distortion, harmonic attenuation and reactive power compensated.

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical & Electronic Engineering) Switching {{losses in}} power {{electronic}} converters {{can be reduced}} by using snubbers, or resonant circuits. Simple snubbers can be implemented without much effort, but then energy is still dissipated, which reduces {{the efficiency of the}} converter. Regenerative snubbers are known, but these usually require complicated additional circuits. The use of nonlinear capacitors as turn-off snubbers has been investigated, and proved profitable. The main reason for this is the much smaller amount of energy which is stored in the the nonlinear capacitors, compared to linear capacitors. Resonant circuits reduce switching losses by allowing switchings to occur when the voltage across the switching device, or the current through the switching device is zero. This effect is called soft-switching and to obtain this, <b>resonance</b> between an <b>inductor</b> and capacitor is usually involved. Resonant circuits have the disadvantage that the installed switching power cannot be used optimally. This drawback has been reduced by using a saturable inductor in the resonant circuit. This thesis considers the use of both nonlinear capacitors and nonlinear inductors in a resonant phase arm. It was found that the nonlinear resonant elements lead to very low overdimensioning of the switching devices, and minimal switching losses in such a phase arm. Very few additional components are used, which keeps the cost of the converter down. A 1. 5 kW converter was constructed in which the double nonlinear resonant phase arm was implemented. This converter was investigated both experimentaly, and by means of computer simulations. The converter is also compared with {{the current state of the}} art. It is concluded that resonant phase arms with both. nonlinear inductors and nonlinear capacitors can function effectively in power electronic converters. Some important advantages are also assosiated with the use of the double nonlinear resonant circuit...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} a {{piezoelectric}} transducer in energy conversion is rapidly expanding in several applications. Some of the industrial applications for which a high power ultrasound transducer can be used are surface cleaning, water treatment, plastic welding and food sterilization. Also, a high power ultrasound transducer plays a great role in biomedical applications such as diagnostic and therapeutic applications. An ultrasound transducer is usually applied to convert electrical energy to mechanical energy and vice versa. In some high power ultrasound system, ultrasound transducers are applied as a transmitter, as a receiver or both. As a transmitter, it converts electrical energy to mechanical energy while a receiver converts mechanical energy to electrical energy as a sensor for control system. Once a piezoelectric transducer is excited by electrical signal, piezoelectric material starts to vibrate and generates ultrasound waves. A portion of the ultrasound waves which passes through the medium will be sensed by the receiver and converted to electrical energy. To drive an ultrasound transducer, an excitation signal should be properly designed otherwise undesired signal (low quality) can deteriorate {{the performance of the}} transducer (energy conversion) and increase power consumption in the system. For instance, some portion of generated power may be delivered in unwanted frequency which is not acceptable for some applications especially for biomedical applications. To achieve better performance of the transducer, along with the quality of the excitation signal, the characteristics of the high power ultrasound transducer should be taken into consideration as well. In this regard, several simulation and experimental tests are carried out in this research to model high power ultrasound transducers and systems. During these experiments, high power ultrasound transducers are excited by several excitation signals with different amplitudes and frequencies, using a network analyser, a signal generator, a high power amplifier and a multilevel converter. Also, to analyse the behaviour of the ultrasound system, the voltage ratio of the system is measured in different tests. The voltage across transmitter is measured as an input voltage then divided by the output voltage which is measured across receiver. The results of the transducer characteristics and the ultrasound system behaviour are discussed in chapter 4 and 5 of this thesis. Each piezoelectric transducer has several resonance frequencies in which its impedance has lower magnitude as compared to non-resonance frequencies. Among these resonance frequencies, just at one of those frequencies, the magnitude of the impedance is minimum. This resonance frequency is known as the main resonance frequency of the transducer. To attain higher efficiency and deliver more power to the ultrasound system, the transducer is usually excited at the main resonance frequency. Therefore, it is important to find out this frequency and other resonance frequencies. Hereof, a frequency detection method is proposed in this research which is discussed in chapter 2. An extended electrical model of the ultrasound transducer with multiple resonance frequencies consists of several RLC legs in parallel with a capacitor. Each RLC leg represents one of the resonance frequencies of the ultrasound transducer. At <b>resonance</b> frequency the <b>inductor</b> reactance and capacitor reactance cancel out each other and the resistor of this leg represents power conversion of the system at that frequency. This concept is shown in simulation and test results presented in chapter 4. To excite a high power ultrasound transducer, a high power signal is required. Multilevel converters are usually applied to generate a high power signal but the drawback of this signal is low quality in comparison with a sinusoidal signal. In some applications like ultrasound, it is extensively important to generate a high quality signal. Several control and modulation techniques are introduced in different papers to control the output voltage of the multilevel converters. One of those techniques is harmonic elimination technique. In this technique, switching angles are chosen in such way to reduce harmonic contents in the output side. It is undeniable that increasing the number of the switching angles results in more harmonic reduction. But to have more switching angles, more output voltage levels are required which increase the number of components and cost of the converter. To improve the quality of the output voltage signal with no more components, a new harmonic elimination technique is proposed in this research. Based on this new technique, more variables (DC voltage levels and switching angles) are chosen to eliminate more low order harmonics compared to conventional harmonic elimination techniques. In conventional harmonic elimination method, DC voltage levels are same and only switching angles are calculated to eliminate harmonics. Therefore, the number of eliminated harmonic is limited by the number of switching cycles. In the proposed modulation technique, the switching angles and the DC voltage levels are calculated off-line to eliminate more harmonics. Therefore, the DC voltage levels are not equal and should be regulated. To achieve this aim, a DC/DC converter is applied to adjust the DC link voltages with several capacitors. The effect of the new harmonic elimination technique on the output quality of several single phase multilevel converters is explained in chapter 3 and 6 of this thesis. According to the electrical model of high power ultrasound transducer, this device can be modelled as parallel combinations of RLC legs with a main capacitor. The impedance diagram of the transducer in frequency domain shows it has capacitive characteristics in almost all frequencies. Therefore, using a voltage source converter to drive a high power ultrasound transducer can create significant leakage current through the transducer. It happens due to significant voltage stress (dv/dt) across the transducer. To remedy this problem, LC filters are applied in some applications. For some applications such as ultrasound, using a LC filter can deteriorate the performance of the transducer by changing its characteristics and displacing the resonance frequency of the transducer. For such a case a current source converter could be a suitable choice to overcome this problem. In this regard, a current source converter is implemented and applied to excite the high power ultrasound transducer. To control the output current and voltage, a hysteresis control and unipolar modulation are used respectively. The results of this test are explained in chapter 7...|$|R
