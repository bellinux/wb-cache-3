5|$|In 1940 Alvarez {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory (MIT), where he {{contributed to a}} number of World War II radar projects, from early {{improvements}} to Identification friend or foe (IFF) radar beacons, now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars. Enemy submarines would wait until the <b>radar</b> <b>signal</b> was getting strong and then submerge, escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a <b>radar</b> <b>signal</b> whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached the sub, the signal—as measured by the sub—got progressively weaker, and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and didn't submerge. The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has {{played a major role in}} aviation, most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Alvarez spent a few months at the University of Chicago working on nuclear reactors for Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos to work for Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan project. Alvarez worked on the design of explosive lenses, and the development of exploding-bridgewire detonators. As a member of Project Alberta, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress, and later the bombing of Hiroshima from the B-29 The Great Artiste.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} is turned on before it turns off so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo from the target is received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs {{would not be able to}} see returns from a target less than 150m away, because the <b>radar</b> <b>signal</b> travelling at the speed of light would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} largely at {{the urging}} of the Admiralty, who saw it as a solution to detecting the conning towers of partially submerged U-Boats. After a visit by Tizard to GEC's Hirst Research Centre in Wembley in November 1939, and a follow-up visit by Watt, the company took up development and developed a working 25cm set using modified VT90s by the summer of 1940. With this success, Lovell and a new addition to the Airborne Group, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, began experimenting with horn-type antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy. Instead of broadcasting the <b>radar</b> <b>signal</b> across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft and listening to echoes from everywhere in that volume, this system would allow the radar to be used like a flashlight, pointed in the direction of observation. This would greatly increase the amount of energy falling on a target, and improve detection capability.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With the {{increasingly}} complex electromagnetic environment and continuous appearance of advanced system <b>radars,</b> <b>signals</b> received by <b>radar</b> reconnaissance receivers {{become even more}} intensive and complex, because scanning time of radar reconnaissance of each direction is very small, composition of the signals received are very complex, number of <b>signals</b> from different <b>radar</b> emitters differ greatly, traditional radar sorting methods can’t process the signals effectively. Aiming at solving the above problem, a novel <b>radar</b> multi-parameter <b>signal</b> sorting method based on data field and hierarchical clustering is proposed. Data field is introduced to reduce compute capacity and determine the parameters of hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering is known that can obtain multi-level clustering structure of different particle size, by which, we can get small number of <b>radar</b> <b>signals</b> drown in many <b>radar</b> <b>signals.</b> Experimental results show that method {{presented in this paper}} can sort <b>radar</b> <b>signals</b> in complex electromagnetic environment effectively...|$|R

25|$|Other {{mathematical}} {{developments in}} <b>radar</b> <b>signal</b> processing include time-frequency analysis (Weyl Heisenberg or wavelet), {{as well as}} the chirplet transform which makes use of the change of frequency of returns from moving targets ("chirp").|$|E
25|$|The <b>radar</b> <b>signal</b> {{was locked}} on target and its data was {{wirelessly}} transmitted to a ground receiver that {{was connected to}} the artillery servomechanism feedback control system, causing the servo to accurately modify its angular position and maintain it for an optimum amount of time, long enough to fire at the calculated (predicted) coordinates of the target and thus successfully track the target.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, {{additional}} tests {{began to be}} made, starting with Irwin Shapiro's measurement of the relativistic time delay in <b>radar</b> <b>signal</b> travel time near the sun. Beginning in 1974, Hulse, Taylor and others have studied the behaviour of binary pulsars experiencing much stronger gravitational fields than {{those found in the}} Solar System. Both in the weak field limit (as in the Solar System) and with the stronger fields present in systems of binary pulsars the predictions of general relativity have been extremely well tested locally.|$|E

25|$|In all {{electromagnetic}} radiation, {{the electric}} field is {{perpendicular to the}} direction of propagation, and the electric field direction is the polarization of the wave. For a transmitted <b>radar</b> <b>signal,</b> the polarization can be controlled to yield different effects. Radars use horizontal, vertical, linear, and circular polarization to detect different types of reflections. For example, circular polarization is used to minimize the interference caused by rain. Linear polarization returns usually indicate metal surfaces. Random polarization returns usually indicate a fractal surface, such as rocks or soil, and are used by navigation radars.|$|E
25|$|As more {{information}} about the signal became available, its purpose as a <b>radar</b> <b>signal</b> became increasingly obvious. In particular, its signal contained a clearly recognizable structure in each pulse, which was eventually identified as a 31-bit pseudo-random binary sequence, with a bit-width of 100 μs resulting in a 3.1 ms pulse. This sequence is usable for a 100μs chirped pulse amplification system, giving a resolution of 15km (10mi) (the distance light travels in 50μs). When a second Woodpecker appeared, this one located in eastern Russia but also pointed toward the US and covering blank spots in the first system's pattern, this conclusion became inescapable.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the new project was that Director T-10 {{encountered}} difficulties in calculating the target velocity by differentiating the target position. Due to discontinuities, variations and noise in the <b>radar</b> <b>signal,</b> the position derivatives sometimes fluctuated wildly and this caused erratic motion in the servomechanisms of the gun because their control signal {{was based on the}} value of the derivatives. This could be mitigated by smoothing or averaging out the data but this caused delays in the feedback loop that enabled the target to escape. As well, the algorithms of Director T-10 required a number of transformations from cartesian (rectangular) to polar coordinates and back to Cartesian, a process that introduced additional tracking errors.|$|E

25|$|Clutter {{may also}} {{originate}} from multipath echoes from valid targets caused by ground reflection, atmospheric ducting or ionospheric reflection/refraction (e.g., anomalous propagation). This clutter type is especially bothersome since {{it appears to}} move and behave like other normal (point) targets of interest. In a typical scenario, an aircraft echo is reflected from the ground below, appearing to the receiver as an identical target below the correct one. The radar may try to unify the targets, reporting the target at an incorrect height, or eliminating it {{on the basis of}} jitter or a physical impossibility. Terrain bounce jamming exploits this response by amplifying the <b>radar</b> <b>signal</b> and directing it downward. These problems can be overcome by incorporating a ground map of the radar's surroundings and eliminating all echoes which appear to originate below ground or above a certain height. Monopulse can be improved by altering the elevation algorithm used at low elevation. In newer air traffic control radar equipment, algorithms are used to identify the false targets by comparing the current pulse returns to those adjacent, as well as calculating return improbabilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{transponder}} {{problem had}} been growing before the introduction of AIS. IFF worked {{on the basis of}} a small receiver/transmitter set that listened for pulses from a radar and produced a low-power pulse broadcast on the same frequency but slightly delayed. The signal returned to the radar-equipped aircraft along with the original <b>radar</b> <b>signal.</b> When the two were amplified and displayed, the IFF signal caused the blip seen on the radar screen to stretch out. The original 1.5m radar system had by this time been adapted to a wide range of roles including AI, ASV and acting as the basis for both the CHL and the new AMES Type 7 ground control interception radars. To avoid interference problems, each of these operated on slightly different frequencies, from about 180 to 210MHz. The Navy and Army added their own variations. The IFF Mk. II, originally designed to respond to the Mk. IV, had to be repeatedly modified to respond to new radar frequencies, and none of the many models were able to respond to all of these.|$|E

25|$|A {{radar system}} has a {{transmitter}} that emits radio waves called <b>radar</b> <b>signals</b> in predetermined directions. When these {{come into contact}} with an object they are usually reflected or scattered in many directions.

Some of these make the use of radar altimeters possible. The <b>radar</b> <b>signals</b> that are reflected back towards the transmitter are the desirable ones that make radar work. If the object is moving either toward or away from the transmitter, there is a slight equivalent change in the frequency of the radio waves, caused by the Doppler effect.|$|R

However, beam riding also means that the missile has to fly directly at its target, and therefore cannot [...] "lead" [...] it to a calculated intercept point.
