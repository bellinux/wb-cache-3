40|$|This work aims {{to develop}} a smart LED {{lighting}} system, which is remotely controlled by Android apps via handheld devices, e. g., smartphones, tablets, and so forth. The status of energy use is reflected by readings displayed on a handheld device, and it is treated as a criterion in the lighting mode design of a system. A multimeter, a wireless light dimmer, an IR learning <b>remote</b> <b>module,</b> etc. are connected to a server by means of RS 232 / 485 and a human computer interface on a touch screen. The wireless data communication is designed to operate {{in compliance with the}} ZigBee standard, and signal processing on sensed data is made through a self adaptive weighted data fusion algorithm. A low variation in data fusion together with a high stability is experimentally demonstrated in this work. The wireless light dimmer as well as the IR learning <b>remote</b> <b>module</b> can be instructed directly by command given on the human computer interface, and the reading on a multimeter can be displayed thereon via the server. This proposed smart LED lighting system can be remotely controlled and self learning mode can be enabled by a single handheld device via WiFi transmission.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} extensions to {{the functional}} language Erlang which provide a secure execution environment for remotely sourced code. This {{is in contrast}} to much existing work which has focused on securing procedural languages. Using a language such as Erlang provides a high degree of inherent run-time safety, which means effort can be focused on providing a suitable degree of system safety. We found that the main changes needed were the use of unforgeable (capability) references with access rights to control the use of system resources; the provision of a hierarchy of execution nodes to provide custom views of the resources available and to impose utilisation limits; and support for <b>remote</b> <b>module</b> loading. We then discuss prototype implementations of these changes, used to evaluate their utility and impact on visibility for the users of the language, and mention work in progress using this foundation to specify safety policies by filtering messages to server processes. 1 Introducti [...] ...|$|R
