If the blip was slightly longer on the <b>right</b> <b>than</b> left side of the azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|E

However, {{the success}} of the {{conservative}} opposition forced the moderate Bush to move further to the <b>right</b> <b>than</b> in the previous election, and to incorporate many socially conservative planks in the party platform. Bush allowed Buchanan to give the keynote address at the Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas, and his culture war speech alienated many moderates.|$|E
25|$|The attack {{prompted}} the Government of Finland, Parliament of Finland representatives and the President of Finland Sauli Niinistö to discuss fast-tracking the intelligence bill. The bill {{was intended to}} enhance national security against serious threats, such as terrorism, with both civilian and military intelligence. New powers granted with the bill would include network traffic intelligence and intelligence gathering abroad. Prime Minister of Finland Juha Sipilä said {{on the need for}} intelligence gathering reform that it should be “obvious from a constitutional standpoint that the right to life is a more precious fundamental <b>right</b> <b>than</b> the right to privacy in light of the Turku events".|$|E

25|$|If the point, A {{had been}} chosen {{to the right of}} the {{azeotrope}} rather than to the left, the distillate at point C would be farther to the <b>right</b> <b>than</b> A, which is to say that the distillate would be richer in X and poorer in Y than the original mixture. So in this case too, the distillate moves away from the azeotrope and the residue moves toward it. This is characteristic of negative azeotropes. No amount of distillation, however, can make either the distillate or the residue arrive on the opposite side of the azeotrope from the original mixture. This is characteristic of all azeotropes.|$|E
25|$|A hernia is the {{abnormal}} exit {{of tissue}} or an organ, {{such as the}} bowel, through {{the wall of the}} cavity in which it normally resides. Hernias come {{in a number of different}} types. Most commonly they involve the abdomen, specifically the groin. Groin hernias are most common of the inguinal type but may also be femoral. Other hernias include hiatus, incisional, and umbilical hernias. Symptoms are present in about 66% of people with groin hernias. This may include pain or discomfort especially with coughing, exercise, or going to the bathroom. Often it gets worse throughout the day and improves when lying down. A bulging area may occur that becomes larger when bearing down. Groin hernias occur more often on the <b>right</b> <b>than</b> left side. The main concern is strangulation, where the blood supply to part of the bowel is blocked. This usually produces severe pain and tenderness of the area. Hiatus or hiatal hernias often result in heartburn but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating.|$|E

500|$|Additional {{issues have}} been raised over Curtis's {{depiction}} of the neoconservatives. Davis's article in National Review showed his displeasure with Curtis's depiction of Leo Strauss, claiming, [...] "In Curtis's world, it is Strauss, not Osama bin Laden, who is the real evil genius." [...] Peter Bergen claimed the film exaggerated the influence of Strauss over neoconservatism, crediting the political philosophy more to Albert Wohlstetter. A 2005 review on Christopher Null's Filmcritic.com took issue with Curtis's retelling of the attacks on Bill Clinton in 'The Phantom Victory', crediting these more to the American Religious <b>Right</b> <b>than</b> the [...] "bookish university types" [...] of the neoconservative movement.|$|E
500|$|During the campaign, Leslie's {{opponent}} Republican John Marshall Harlan was blasted as a [...] "political weathercock" [...] {{for having}} changed his stance on many issues. In one joint debate, Leslie quoted an antebellum speech wherein Harlan {{had called the}} Republican platform [...] "revolutionary, and if carried out, {{would result in the}} destruction of our free government." [...] Harlan admitted his inconsistent stands, declaring that he would rather be <b>right</b> <b>than</b> consistent. Meanwhile, Leslie began moving closer to the [...] "New Departure" [...] wing of his party {{during the course of the}} campaign. Ultimately, Leslie's supporters deemed him [...] "sober, conservative, and safe", and this perception enabled him to defeat Harlan by a considerable margin in the first election in which blacks were allowed to vote.|$|E

500|$|Once the {{abolition}} of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: [...] "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing <b>right,</b> <b>than</b> I do in signing this paper." [...] For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors' Conference; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.|$|E
500|$|On the Declaration of Independence {{the colonies}} became {{sovereign}} states.

It is the received opinion that the colonies succeeded to {{the title of the}} crown to all the ungranted lands within their respective boundaries, with the exclusive right to extinguish by purchase the Indian title, and to regulate dealings with the Indian tribes. ‘There was no territory in the United States,’ said JOHNSON, J., in Harcourt v. Gaillard, 12 Wheat. 523, ‘that was claimed in any other <b>right</b> <b>than</b> that of one of the confederated states; therefore there could be no acquisition of territory made by the United States distinct from or independent of some one of the United States.’ ...|$|E
500|$|Winslet had {{roles in}} two period dramas of 1996Jude and Hamlet. As with her Heavenly Creatures part, her roles in these films {{were those of}} women with a [...] "mad edge". In Michael Winterbottom's Jude, {{based on the novel}} Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy, she played Sue Bridehead, a young woman with suffragette leanings who falls in love with her cousin, Jude (played by Christopher Eccleston). Roger Ebert {{believed}} that the part allowed Winslet to display her acting range, and praised her for [...] "making Sue into a sassy, defiant woman who would rather be <b>right</b> <b>than</b> happy". After unsuccessfully auditioning for Kenneth Branagh's 1994 film Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Winslet was cast for the part of Ophelia, the doomed lover of the title character, in Branagh's adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet. Winslet, at 20 years old, was intimidated by the experience of performing Shakespeare with established actors such as Branagh and Julie Christie, saying that the job required her to [...] "hit a certain level of intellect that I don't believe I have". Even so, Mike Jeffries of Empire believed that she had played the part [...] "well beyond her years". Despite the acclaim, Jude and Hamlet earned little at the box office.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{awareness}} of children's developmental needs and rights {{has led to}} a global move toward giving children and adolescents a greater degree of autonomy in the decisions affecting their own lives. This article presents two studies examining the role of culture and religion in 12 -year-old children's perceptions of their rights across three cultures. The first study showed that U. S. and Swiss children advocated for more self-determination <b>rights</b> <b>than</b> Chinese-Malaysian children; U. S. and Chinese-Malaysian children advocated for more nurturance <b>rights</b> <b>than</b> Swiss children. Within the Chinese-Malaysian sample, Buddhist children were more likely to advocate for self-determination rights as compared to Christian children. Using a revised Children's Rights Interview (rCRI), the second study showed that on average U. S. and Chinese-Malaysian children were more likely to advocate for self-determination <b>rights</b> <b>than</b> nurturance <b>rights.</b> However, {{there were no significant differences}} between the two cultural groups in terms of the overall responses. The results of the studies are discussed in terms of the cultural orientation and constructivist frameworks...|$|R
