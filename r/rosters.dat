40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a shift <b>rostering</b> problem that surprisingly {{has not been}} studied in literature: the weekend shift <b>rostering</b> problem. It is motivated by our experience that employees’ shift preferences predominantly focus on the weekends, since many social activities happen during weekends. The Weekend <b>Rostering</b> Problem (WRP) addresses the <b>rostering</b> of weekend shifts, for which we design a problem specific heuristic. We consider the WRP as {{the first phase of}} the shift <b>rostering</b> problem. To complete the shift <b>roster,</b> the second phase assigns the weekday shifts using an existing algorithm. We discuss effects of this two-phase approach both on the weekend shift <b>roster</b> and on the <b>roster</b> as a whole. We demonstrate that our first-phase heuristic is effective both on generated instances and real-life instances. For situations where the weekend shift <b>roster</b> is one of the key determinants of the quality of the complete <b>roster,</b> our two-phase approach shows to be effective when incorporated in a commercially implemented algorithm...|$|R
