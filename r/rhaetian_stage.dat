5000|$|Coloradisaurus (meaning [...] "Colorados Los Colorados Formation lizard") is a genus of massospondylid sauropodomorph dinosaur. It lived {{during the}} Late Triassic period (Norian to <b>Rhaetian</b> <b>stages)</b> {{in what is}} now La Rioja Province, Argentina. It is known from the holotype PVL 5904, nearly {{complete}} skull. It was discovered and collected from the upper section of the Los Colorados Formation. Originally named Coloradia by Jose F. Bonaparte in 1978, this name had already been assigned to a moth, and so the animal was renamed. The genus was first named by David Lambert in 1983 and the type species is Coloradisaurus brevis. It may in fact be an adult specimen of Mussaurus. Cladistic analyses by Yates (2007), Yates et al. (2010, 2011) and Novas et al. (2011) found that Coloradisaurus is basal to the Glacialisaurus-Lufengosaurus clade within Massospondylidae.|$|R

5000|$|Allokotosauria is a clade {{of early}} archosauromorph {{reptiles}} from the Middle to Late Triassic known from Asia, Africa, North America and Europe. Allokotosauria was first described and named {{when a new}} monophyletic grouping of specialized herbivorous archosauromorphs was recovered by Sterling J. Nesbitt, John J. Flynn, Adam C. Pritchard, J. Michael Parrish, Lovasoa Ranivoharimanana and André R. Wyss in 2015. The name Allokotosauria is derived from Greek meaning [...] "strange reptiles" [...] in reference to unexpected grouping of early archosauromorph with a high disparity of features typically associated with herbivory. Nesbitt et al. (2015) defined {{the group as a}} stem-based taxon containing Azendohsaurus madagaskarensis and Trilophosaurus buettneri and all taxa more closely related to them than to Tanystropheus longobardicus, Proterosuchus fergusi, Protorosaurus speneri or Rhynchosaurus articeps. Therefore, Allokotosauria includes the families Azendohsauridae and Trilophosauridae by definition, as well as the potentially more basal Pamelaria which is closer to them than to other early archosauromorphs. Pamelaria is the earliest known allokotosaur, dating to the Anisian of India. Azendohsauridae is currently represented by a single genus Azendohsaurus known from the Ladinian to Carnian of Africa, while trilophosaurids are known from the Carnian to <b>Rhaetian</b> <b>stages</b> of North America, England and potentially European Russia.|$|R
50|$|Ichthyosauridae is an extinct {{family of}} thunnosaur ichthyosaurs {{from the latest}} Triassic and Early Jurassic (<b>Rhaetian</b> to Pliensbachian <b>stages)</b> of Europe, and {{possibly}} also from the middle Early Cretaceous (Hauterivian or Barremian stage) of Iraq. Named by Charles Lucien Bonaparte, in 1841, it is usually thought to contain a single genus, Ichthyosaurus, which is known from several species from the Early Jurassic. In 2013, Fischer et al. named and described Malawania anachronus from the middle Early Cretaceous of Iraq. It was found to share several synapomorphies with the type species of this family, Ichthyosaurus communis, and a large phylogenetic analysis recovered these species as sister taxa. Despite its geologically younger age, M. anachronus was also assigned to Ichthyosauridae.|$|R

50|$|While most traversodonts were {{relatively}} large cynodonts, some Late Triassic European forms like Maubeugia and Habayia were very small. These traversodonts lived during the <b>Rhaetian</b> <b>stage</b> {{of the latest}} Triassic when rising sea levels divided western Europe into an island archipelago. Traversodontids on these islands likely became smaller {{as a result of}} insular dwarfism.|$|E
5000|$|Conodonts are an extinct {{class of}} animals whose feeding {{apparatuses}} called teeth or elements are common microfossils found in strata {{dating from the}} Stage 10 of the Furongian, the fourth and final series of the Cambrian, to the <b>Rhaetian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Late Triassic.

50|$|Habayia is a genus of traversodontid cynodont {{from the}} Late Triassic of Belgium. A single postcanine tooth {{was found in}} Habay-la-Vieille in {{southern}} Belgium. Based {{on the size of}} the tooth, Habayia was very small. Habayia lived during the <b>Rhaetian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Late Triassic at a time when western Europe was an island archipelago due to high sea levels. The small size of Habayia may be a result of insular dwarfism.|$|E

G. pulcherrimus may have remained unchanged for so long because it could tolerate {{a wide range of}} ecological conditions. Although it always needed to live in an aquatic habitat, G. pulcherrimus may have been able to live in a variety of different water bodies {{with a wide range of}} salinity.|$|E
5000|$|Smok (meaning [...] "dragon" [...] in Polish) is an extinct genus {{of large}} {{carnivorous}} archosaur. It lived during the latest Triassic period (latest Norian to early <b>Rhaetian</b> <b>stage,</b> between 205-200 Ma). Its remains {{have been found}} in Lisowice, southern Poland. The type species is Smok wawelski (after the Wawel Dragon) and was named in 2012. It is larger than any other known predatory archosaur from the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic of central Europe. The relation of Smok to other archosaurs has not yet been thoroughly studied; it may be a rauisuchid, prestosuchid or ornithosuchid crurotarsan (part of the crocodile line of archosaurs) or a theropod dinosaur (part of the bird line of archosaurs).|$|E
50|$|While Antetonitrus {{is not the}} {{earliest}} sauropod from a phylogenetic standpoint, it currently {{one of the oldest}} known sauropod chronologically, or rather tied for that distinction with other early sauropods from the same formation, like Melanorosaurus and Blikanasaurus. Fossils of these animals were recovered from the Elliot Formation. Initially it was though to be recovered from the Lower Elliot Formation which dates to the Norian stage of the Late Triassic, or approximately 221 to 210 million years ago. Later studies indicate that it was actually recovered from the Early Jurassic Upper Elliot Formation. Before Antetonitrus and the other animals recovered from the Lower Elliot Formation were recognized as sauropods, the oldest known sauropod had been Isanosaurus from the <b>Rhaetian</b> <b>stage</b> of Thailand.|$|E
50|$|The {{remains of}} the type {{specimen}} of Lophostropheus airelensis was recovered in the Airel Quarry locality of the Moon-Airel Formation, in Basse-Normandie, France.

50|$|The {{specimens}} of Liliensternus, {{designated as the}} syntype series HMN BM.R.2175, were recovered near Großen Gleichberg in the Trossingen Formation of the Middle Keuper Group in Thuringia, Germany, together with remains of Ruehleia. The syntypes were discovered by Count Hugo Rühle von Lilienstern {{in the winter of}} 1932/1933 in marlstone (lime-rich mudstone) deposited in the Norian stage of the Late Triassic period, approximately 228 to 208 million years ago. A left metatarsal later assigned to this genus, also deposited in the Norian, was collected in 1834 in the sandstone of the Trossingen Formation in Bayern, Germany. This metatarsal was originally described as a manual or pedal element by Meyer (1855) and a pubic fragment by Huene (1908) of Plateosaurus, and the material was re-identified as a proximal metatarsal belonging to Liliensternus by Moser in 2003. Sander (1992) referred additional material to Liliensternus, which was thought to have been collected in 1961 grey/green marlstone from the Löwenstein Formation in Aargau, Switzerland, which is considered to also be from the Norian stage of the Late Triassic period. A tooth referred to this Liliensternus, deposited in the Norian, and collected in 1913 in dark red mudstone from the Löwenstein Formation in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The only material assigned to this genus from later strata was discovered in 1913 in blue claystone from the <b>Rhaetian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Late Triassic, in the Trossingen Formation from Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany, approximately 208 to 201 million years ago. The Liliensternus specimens remained in Hugo Rühle von Lilienstern's castle until 1969 when they were transferred to the collection of the Humboldt Museum in Berlin, their present location.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNew {{calcareous}} nannofossil analyses {{from the}} Northern Calcareous Alps of Austria are herein used to update {{and improve the}} state {{of knowledge about the}} oldest occurrence of coccolithophores reported in the literature. Previously reported Norian occurrences of coccoliths were based on an obsolete Triassic chronostratigraphy, in which the <b>Rhaetian</b> <b>stage</b> was subsumed into the Norian (‘Sevatian 2 ’). The oldest stratigraphical record of coccoliths spp. lies just below the Norian-Rhaetian boundary and the first coccolith species, Crucirhabdus minutus, is recorded from the base of <b>Rhaetian</b> <b>stage.</b> The latter bio-event is located just above the First Occurrence of the conodont Misikella posthersteni and the first occurrence of the ammonoid Paracochloceras suessi in the Steinbergkogel section (Austria), Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) candidate for the Norian–Rhaetian boundary. The appearance of the coccolith Crucirhabdus minutus is seen as a robust biochronological datum that will provide useful constraints for Triassic biostratigraphy, palaeoclimatic modelling and phylogenetic reconstructions. The new calcareous nannofossil biochronology of Steinbergkogel that we present herein completes the existing biostratigraphic characterization of the Norian-Rhaetian transition based on conodonts and ammonoids and strengthens the position of Steinbergkogel as the best GSSP proposed section for the base of the Rhaetian. The record of coccolithophores across the Norian–Rhaetian boundary at Steinbergkogel takes place along with a discernible increase in abundance of Prinsiosphaera triassica, as well as the appearance of Euconusphaera zlambachensis, which are the two most important Rhaetian pelagic carbonate producers. This succession of bio-events is interpreted as the initiation of the pelagic carbonate production driven by the successful spreading of calcareous nannofossils in the Western Tethys during the Rhaetian...|$|E

40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{reported}} from {{an investigation of}} the conodont associations found in the Late Triassic carbonate succession of the so-called "Catena Costiera Calabrese" that crops out in the tectonic window of Monte Cocuzzo. The succession of Colle del Crapio consists of alternating carbonate mud, breccia and calciturbidites deposited in a toe-of-slope to basin setting and contains rich and well-preserved conodont faunas pertaining to two biozones. The lower zone is characterised by the occurrence of Epigondolella slovakensis and may be referred to the Late Norian (Sevatian). The upper zone is characterised by Misikella hernsteini associated with M. posthernsteini. The chronostratigraphic setting of the latter zone is more controversial, as it may be regarded as latest Sevatian (Upper Norian) according to Krystyn (1990) and Golebiowski (1990), while according to the zonation of Kozur & Mock (1991) the first occurrence of M. posthernsteini marks the beginning of the <b>Rhaetian</b> <b>stage.</b>     <hr class="abstract-testo" /...|$|E
