5|$|This {{exothermic}} reaction is very slow below 100°C, but at temperature above 900°C {{the reaction is}} rapid. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979, but at that time, the containment building was not damaged. The same reaction occurred in the reactors 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011 leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents.

50|$|Abraham Whistler's {{background}} in the animated series {{is the same as}} that in the films, although he appears younger and with a much more kempt appearance than the cinematic interpretation of the character. Whistler was a vampire hunter who took on a young Blade and trained him in martial arts and as a vampire hunter. Blade, who was half-vampire himself, was given a serum developed by Whistler that would stop him from craving human plasma. When Blade hunted Morbius the Living Vampire, a young human student who was accidentally mutated into a vampire-like creature, Blade discovered the Neogenic <b>Recombinator,</b> which could transform humans into vampires. Whistler told him not to destroy it, as it could also be used to cure Blade of his vampirism. Morbius was eventually driven into hibernation.|$|E
5000|$|Scorpion {{appeared}} in the 1990s Spider-Man animated series, voiced initially by Martin Landau (until his Academy Award win and subsequent lack of availability) and later by Richard Moll. Mac Gargan is initially depicted as a neurotic, plump, and balding private eye working for J. Jonah Jameson. In an attempt to discover Spider-Man's real identity, Jameson convinces Gargan to {{be transformed into a}} capable superhero by Dr. Stillwell using the Neogenic <b>Recombinator.</b> As Scorpion, he is able to defeat Spider-Man by pulling a water tower onto Spider-Man, but before he can unmask the wall-crawler, he is overcome with pain as he undergoes further uncontrolled mutations that give him green skin, yellow eyes, and talon-like fingers which also drives him insane. Believing more radiation may stop his transformation and return him to normal, he attempts to gain access to a nuclear reactor (where he plans to release it would have destroyed all of New York City) but is found and defeated by Spider-Man, resulting in Scorpion being sent to jail. Scorpion reappears {{as a member of the}} Kingpin's supervillain team (alongside the Chameleon, the Rhino, Mysterio and Doctor Octopus) to kill Spider-Man though he is again defeated by Spider-Man. Desperate to find a cure to his condition, Scorpion kidnaps Stillwell but Stillwell destroys the Neogenic <b>Recombinator</b> to prevent the creation of other beings like Scorpion. After meeting the Vulture, Scorpion kidnaps Vulture from an exploding building to hold hostage, believing Vulture to be smart enough to undo his Scorpion transformation. Eventually, Alistair Smythe, requiring Scorpion's genetic code to further his own experiments, holds the Black Cat hostage to coerce Spider-Man into bringing Scorpion. Scorpion eventually manages to escape Smythe's clutches due to Vulture attacking and attempts to stay away from crime. Scorpion's final appearance is again as a member of the Insidious Six who attempt to locate the Red Skull's doomsday device for Kingpin. At the end of the episode, he is shown to have escaped the police.|$|E
40|$|The Moran {{model with}} {{recombination}} is considered, which describes {{the evolution of}} the genetic composition of a population under recombination and resampling. There are n sites (or loci), a finite number of letters (or alleles) at every site, and we do not make any scaling assumptions. In particular, we do not assume a diffusion limit. We consider the following marginal ancestral recombination process. Let S = { 1, [...] . c,n} and A={A_ 1, [...] . c, A_m} be a partition of S. We concentrate on the joint probability of the letters at the sites in A_ 1 in individual 1, [...] . c, at the sites in A_m in individual m, where the individuals are sampled from the current population without replacement. Following the ancestry of these sites backwards in time yields a process on the set of partitions of S, which, in the diffusion limit, turns into a marginalised version of the n-locus ancestral recombination graph. With the help of an inclusion-exclusion principle, we show that the type distribution corresponding to a given partition may be represented in a systematic way, with the help of so-called <b>recombinators</b> and sampling functions. The same is true of correlation functions (known as linkage disequilibria in genetics) of all orders. We prove that the partitioning process (backward in time) is dual to the Moran population process (forward in time), where the sampling function plays the role of the duality function. This sheds new light on the work of Bobrowski, Wojdyla, and Kimmel (2010). The result also leads to a closed system of ordinary differential equations for the expectations of the sampling functions, which can be translated into expected type distributions and expected linkage disequilibria.

Hydrogen gas was vented into the reactor maintenance halls and the resulting explosive mixture of hydrogen with air oxygen detonated. The explosions severely damaged external buildings {{and at least one}} containment building. The reaction also occurred during the Chernobyl Accident, when the steam from the reactor began to escape. Many water cooled reactor containment buildings have catalyst-based <b>recombinator</b> units installed to rapidly convert hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the explosive limit is reached.|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Farley Stillwell {{appeared}} in the 1990s Spider-Man episode [...] "Sting of the Scorpion", voiced by Michael Rye. J. Jonah Jameson hired him to turn Mac Gargan into the Scorpion. When Scorpion wanted Farley to restore him later on, Farley ended up knocked out and hospitalized. In a flashback in [...] "Make a Wish", Farley was the scientist that led the experiment involving neogenic research, an accident during this enabled Peter Parker to become Spider-Man. In [...] "The Final Nightmare," [...] Farley was abducted from the hospital by the Scorpion who {{took him to the}} laboratory where Spider-Man, Dr. Curt Connors, and Vulture were. While a fight ensued between Spider-Man, Vulture, and Scorpion, Stillwell planned to destroy the Neogenic <b>Recombinator.</b> His motivations were to make sure that monsters like the Scorpion were never created again. Dr. Curt Connors tried to intervene saying that it would help cure him. When Farley asks him what it would cure him of, Curt turned into the Lizard and attacked. Spider-Man took down Lizard as Farley overloaded the Recombinator's transfomer causing it to explode. Farley later explains to Curt that neogenic research is too dangerous and states that its secrets will stay with him forever. He then vows to disappear, never to be seen again.|$|E
5000|$|Felicia Hardy/Black Cat {{appeared}} in the 1990s Spider-Man: The Animated Series, voiced by Jennifer Hale. Her character was originally depicted as Peter Parker's first love interest before being eventually replaced in this role by Mary Jane Watson, but dates Michael Morbius instead. It is revealed her father the Cat was fooled into sneaking into an American lab during World War II, to memorize the super soldier formula that created Captain America and report back to the Red Skull. At the last moment, the Cat realized the deception and ran away {{to a life of}} crime. In the present, the Cat is in a S.H.I.E.L.D. prison but is then broken out by the Kingpin. Doctor Octopus (working for the Kingpin) kidnaps Felicia as leverage and {{to be used as a}} guinea pig for an improved super soldier formula. The formula proves a success, making her overall physical prowess comparable to Spider-Man and also gives her the ability to switch between her normal blond haired form and her empowered well-muscled white haired form at will; she then recruited Spider-Man to assist in a rescue attempt for her father. After Kraven the Hunter was believed to be creating havoc in New York City, Black Cat helped make Spider-Man realize that Kraven was trying to help Dr. Crawford. She was also featured in a smaller story arc where she was again kidnapped this time by Alistair Smythe to be used as leverage to get Spider-Man to kidnap either the Scorpion or the Vulture. It was later revealed that Smythe had developed a machine reversed engineered from the Time Tablet and Vulture's talons and that data extracted from the genetic and molecular structure of Scorpion (both Vulture and Scorpion suffered heavy exposure to Vulture's earlier prototypes) was needed. The three components were used in conjunction in an attempt to swap age and abilities of the baby Silvermane and Spider-Man but a rescue attempt by Black Cat, Vulture, and the freed Scorpion destroyed the machine and returned Silvermane to his proper age. After Morbius awakens as a vampire, she struggles at figuring out how to stop Morbius because of her personal feelings. She then finds herself teaming up with Blade, Spider-Man, and Morbius to take down Blade's vampire mother who was using Dr. Connors's genetic <b>recombinator</b> to create an army of vampires. She then decides to leave Spider-Man to work for Blade along with Morbius, but not before she admits her love for the web-slinger. She does come back however to help Spider-Man defeat Hydro-Man and also appears at Peter's and Mary Jane's wedding. Black Cat allies herself with Spider-Man and Kingpin fighting droids created by Smythe that are crashing the wedding. After Blade, Morbius, and Black Cat nearly succeeded in capturing Blade's mother, Black Cat was brought into the Secret War due to an effort by Storm, Iron Man, and Spider-Man. She is initially angry and wants to return to Earth. She nearly fell into a river of lava, but Spider-Man saved her by webbing Black Cat's ankle. When Red Skull's stronghold is attacked, she goes after Red Skull while the others are distracted trying to destroy the Cyber-Skulls. However she is seized by Doctor Octopus, covering her mouth. The other heroes are unable to attack with her hostage, but she is freed, though the two villains escape. She is later seen fighting them with other heroes before Doctor Doom sends them back to Earth. After the Secret War was over she was sent back to the exact time and place she was taken from with no memory of the war. Despite her aristocratic background she flirts, kisses, or dates other characters in her age range. She does so more than once with Spider-Man while dating another person. It is alluded to that her promiscuous nature is rooted in her relationship with her father. With him having left her when she was young, she constantly tries to fill that void and if a man disappoints her, leaves, dies, etc.; she turns to Spider-Man because he tends to [...] "always be there" [...] unlike her father.|$|E

40|$|Chi (5 '-GCTGGTGG) is a <b>recombinator</b> in RecA- RecBC-mediated {{recombination}} in Escherichia coli. In bacteriophage λ vegetative recombination, Chi {{is fully}} active {{only when it}} is correctly {{oriented with respect to}} cos, the site that defines the ends of the packaged chromosome. Here we demonstrate that packaging from cos is not necessary for this cos-Chi interaction. Our evidence suggests that correctly oriented cos is an activator of Chi. cos, as an activator, is (1) dominant over cos-, (2) active opposite an extensive heterology, (3) able to interact with Chi only when on the same (cis) chromosome, and (4) able to interact with Chi at distances as far as ≥ 20 kb. Thus, cos and Chi form a two-component <b>recombinator</b> system for general recombination. cos may serve as an asymmetric entry site for a recombination enzyme that recognizes Chi in an asymmetric way...|$|E

M. & Stahl, F. W. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79, 5981 - 5985]. Chi in an inactive state is activated by the in vivo action of a restriction endonuclease at a distant site. This result supports a model for Chi activation in which a recombination machine enters a DNA duplex at an end and travels until it encounters a Chi properly oriented with respect to the direction of enzyme movement.

These events are stimulated by Chi, a <b>recombinator</b> specific to the RecBC pathway.

This opportunity derives from use of a Pretzel magnet as a <b>recombinator</b> and mass filter in the injector to the accelerator.

40|$|The first gas-fed {{ion source}} for {{radiocarbon}} AMS applications (without sputtering) has been operated at the Woods Hole NOSAMS Facility. A three-year, off-line test program resulted in positive carbon ion currents up to 1 mA and negative ion currents up to 80 µA. Recently, the compact, permanent-magnet microwave plasma ion source and magnesium vapor charge-exchange canal were coupled to the <b>recombinator</b> injector of the 2. 5 MV Tandetron. When the ion source was operated on CO_ 2 at a flow {{rate of about}} 200 µ 1 per minute, negative carbon ion beams up to 20 µA were obtained, at an energy of 35 keV. Radiocarbon measurements were performed on standard reference gases and the dynamic response to square-wave pulses of gas was determined. Time constants in the ion source are less than 1 s, which should allow analysis of chromatographic peaks of CO_ 2 with very little broadening. A combustion device has been constructed to generate CO_ 2 for direct injection into the source. Argon carrier gas is used to buffer the pressure at one atmosphere in the sample gas injector. A dedicated ion-beam injector, with higher angular acceptance and higher transmitted currents, is being constructed for the AMS system...|$|E
40|$|Chi (χ, 5 '-GCTGGTGG) is a <b>recombinator</b> in RecA- and RecBC-mediated {{recombination}} in Escherichia coli. In vegetative recombination {{between two}} bacteriophage lambda strains, one with {{and the other}} without Chi (a+χ+b- x a-χob+), the χ-containing recombinant (a-χ+b -) is less abundant than the non-χ-containing recombinant (a+χob+). Previously this was taken was evidence for nonreciprocality of χ-stimulated exchange. This inequality, however, is now seen to result from an event at cos (λ's packaging origin) that both activates Chi and initiates DNA packaging. An event at rightward cos leads to activation of leftward χ on the same chromosome for an exchange to its left. From the resulting circulating dimer (—cos-a+-χo-b +-cos-a [...] χ+-b-—), the cos that activated χ {{is more likely to}} be used for rightward packaging initiation than is the cos from the other parent. Consistent with this coupling model is "biased packaging" in λ carrying two cos sites per monomer genome. When their maturation is dependent on dimerization by χ-stimulated exchange, the phage particles result more often from packaging from the cos that activates χ than from packaging from the other cos. Since Chi activation and packaging can be uncoupled, we infer that some early and reversible step in packaging activates χ. A strong candidate for this step is a double-strand break at cos that provides an oriented entry site for a recombinase...|$|E
40|$|Deep neural {{networks}} with alternating convolutional, max-pooling and decimation layers {{are widely used}} in {{state of the art}} architectures for computer vision. Max-pooling purposefully discards precise spatial information in order to create features that are more robust, and typically orga-nized as lower resolution spatial feature maps. On some tasks, such as whole-image classification, max-pooling de-rived features are well suited; however, for tasks requiring precise localization, such as pixel level prediction and seg-mentation, max-pooling destroys exactly the information re-quired to perform well. Precise localization may be pre-served by shallow convnets without pooling but at the ex-pense of robustness. Can we have our max-pooled multi-layered cake and eat it too? Several papers have proposed summation and concatenation based methods for combin-ing upsampled coarse, abstract features with finer features to produce robust pixel level predictions. Here we intro-duce another model — dubbed <b>Recombinator</b> Networks — where coarse features inform finer features early in their formation such that finer features can make use of several layers of computation in deciding how to use coarse fea-tures. The model is trained once, end-to-end and performs better than summation-based architectures, reducing the er-ror from the previous state of the art on two facial keypoint datasets, AFW and AFLW, by 30 % and beating the current state-of-the-art on 300 W without using extra data.

40|$|Crowdsourcing is {{increasingly}} being adopted to solve simple {{tasks such as}} image labeling and object tagging, {{as well as more}} complex tasks, where crowd workers collaborate in processes with interdependent steps. For the whole range of complexity, research has yielded numerous patterns for coordinating crowd workers in order to optimize crowd accuracy, efficiency, and cost. Process designers, however, often don't know which pattern to apply to a problem at hand when designing new applications for crowdsourcing. In this article, we propose to solve this problem by systematically exploring the design space of complex crowdsourced tasks via automated recombination and auto-experimentation for an issue at hand. Specifically, we propose an approach to finding the optimal process for a given problem by defining the deep structure of the problem in terms of its abstract operators, generating all possible alternatives via the (re) combination of the abstract deep structure with concrete implementations from a Process Repository, and then establishing the best alternative via auto-experimentation. To evaluate our approach, we implemented PPLib (pronounced “People Lib”), a program library that allows for the automated recombination of known processes stored in an easily extensible Process Repository. We evaluated our work by generating and running a plethora of process candidates in two scenarios on Amazon's Mechanical Turk followed by a meta-evaluation, where we looked at {{the differences between the two}} evaluations. Our first scenario addressed the problem of text translation, where our automatic recombination produced multiple processes whose performance almost matched the benchmark established by an expert translation. In our second evaluation, we focused on text shortening; we automatically generated 41 crowd process candidates, among them variations of the well-established Find-Fix-Verify process. While Find-Fix-Verify performed well in this setting, our recombination engine produced five processes that repeatedly yielded better results. We close the article by comparing the two settings where the <b>Recombinator</b> was used, and empirically show that the individual processes performed differently in the two settings, which led us to contend that there is no unifying formula, hence emphasizing the necessity for recombination...|$|E
