5|$|Coffelt's {{account was}} {{reviewed}} by the FBI, which concluded that it differed in significant details from information {{that had not been}} made public, and was therefore a fabrication. Brown, undeterred, continued peddling the story long after Coffelt died in 1975. Multiple media venues, including the television news program 60 Minutes, considered and <b>rejected</b> <b>it.</b> In a 2008 book about Lincoln's descendants, author Charles Lachman revisited Coffelt's tale although it had been discredited 36 years before.|$|E

Hagen belonged to the Oslo chapter, but {{the leader of the}} chapter, Peter N.

On 7 February, Hagen confirmed his leadership candidacy for the electoral committee.|$|E

5|$|The Greek philosopher Zeno {{considered}} {{the problem of}} summing an infinite series to achieve a finite result, but <b>rejected</b> <b>it</b> as an impossibility: the result was Zeno's paradox. Later, Aristotle proposed a philosophical resolution of the paradox, but the mathematical content was apparently unresolved until taken up by Archimedes, {{as it had been}} prior to Aristotle by the Presocratic Atomist Democritus. It was through Archimedes's method of exhaustion that an infinite number of progressive subdivisions could be performed to achieve a finite result. Liu Hui independently employed a similar method a few centuries later.|$|E

She was also unable to include Ian and Tokage's newfound friendship, because Rin and Ian's romantic relationship served as the focus of the story.|$|E

5|$|After he {{graduated}} {{with a degree in}} civil engineering from Siddhartha Engineering College in Vijayawada, Ram Gopal Varma opened a video-rental shop in Ameerpet. Noting his son's interest in films, Penmatsa Krishnamraju (a former sound recordist for Annapurna Studios) helped Varma join the teams of Collector Gari Abbai (1987) and Rao Gari Illu (1988) as an assistant director. Varma befriended actor Akkineni Nagarjuna, and filmmakers Akkineni Venkat and Yarlagadda Surendra. He presented his script for Raathri to them. When Nagarjuna <b>rejected</b> <b>it,</b> Varma presented another script based on his life as a student in Vijayawada. He earlier narrated this script to filmmaker Kovelamudi Raghavendra Rao who suggested few changes because of its serious tone. Varma watched Rao's Kaliyuga Pandavulu (1986) and backed out after understanding Rao's point of view.|$|E
5|$|After the {{financial}} success of Saw, a sequel was immediately green-lit. Leigh Whannell and James Wan were busy preparing {{for their next}} film and were unable to write or direct.

It was decided that, with some changes, it could be made into Saw II. Whannell became available to provide rewrites of the script. The film was given a larger budget and was shot from May to June 2005 in Toronto.|$|E

On June 30, {{a deal to}} Edmonton was finalized, but Heatley <b>rejected</b> <b>it</b> by refusing to waive his no-trade clause. On September 12, 2009, Heatley was traded, along with a fifth-round pick in 2010 NHL Entry Draft, to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for forwards Milan Michalek and Jonathan Cheechoo, {{as well as a}} second-round pick in the 2010 NHL Draft. Michalek would play well for the Senators, but Cheechoo struggled and was demoted to the Binghamton Senators before having his contract bought out in the off-season.|$|E

5|$|All of the spaceships in {{the film}} were miniatures, as visual effects {{supervisors}} believed CGI was not effective enough to create realistic spaceships. The USM Auriga was originally designed by artist Nigel Phelps and resembled a medical instrument. This design proved to be too vertical for the film's opening shot, in which the camera pans out to show the ship, and did not appear satisfactory {{in the film}}'s 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Three days before the design had to be finalized, Jeunet <b>rejected</b> <b>it.</b> Phelps, production illustrator Jim Martin, and concept artist Sylvain Despretz were tasked to redesign the ship. Jeunet felt Martin's design was too much like a space station, while he accepted Despretz's design due to its streamlined and horizontal appearance.|$|E

The movement was pacifist, and while it sought independence for Madagascar, it embraced the French vision of the island {{as part of the}} global Francophone economic and cultural community. Their platform garnered mass support that cut across geographic, ethnic and class divisions, and in November 1946 the trio were elected to represent Madagascar as deputies (députés) in the French National Assembly. The Malagasy deputies submitted a bill to liberate Madagascar from French rule, but French deputies <b>rejected</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{story of}} the poem's origin claimed that Helmer's funeral was held {{on the morning of}} May 2, after which McCrae wrote the poem in 20 minutes. A third claim, by Morrison, was that McCrae worked on the poem as time allowed between arrivals of wounded {{soldiers}} in need of medical attention. Regardless of its true origin, McCrae worked on the poem for months before considering it ready for publication. He submitted it to The Spectator in London but it was <b>rejected.</b> <b>It</b> was then sent to Punch, where it was published on December 8, 1915. It was published anonymously, but Punch attributed the poem to McCrae in its year-end index.|$|E
