25|$|This {{can also}} {{be viewed as a}} high-pass {{electronic}} filter. It is a filter with a single zero at DC (i.e., where angular frequency nbsp&radians) and gain. The high-pass characteristics of a differentiating amplifier (i.e., the low-frequency zero) can lead to stability challenges when the circuit is used in an analog servo loop (e.g., in a PID controller with a significant derivative gain). In particular, as a <b>root</b> <b>locus</b> analysis would show, increasing feedback gain will drive a closed-loop pole toward marginal stability at the DC zero introduced by the differentiator.|$|E

A geometric technique provides direct realization of these asymptotic Butterworth patterns. Since integer {{as well as}} non-integer orders of these patterns can be determined, the method {{can be used to}} identify undesirable design conditions. Finally, the proposed method is extended to linear quadratic regulator problems where optimal <b>root</b> <b>loci</b> are identified.

40|$|A new {{geometric}} way {{of computing}} the asymptotic behavior of unbounded <b>root</b> <b>loci</b> of a strictly proper linear time-invariant control system as loop gain goes to infinity is presented. Properties of certain restricted linear maps and nested restrictions of linear maps are developed, and formulas are {{obtained for the}} leading coefficient of the asymptotic values of the unbounded multivariable <b>root</b> <b>loci</b> are obtained in terms of eigenvalues of those maps. Published results and a certain simple null structure assumption are used to relate these asymptotic values to the structure at infinity of the Smith-McMillan form of the open loop transfer function. Explicit matrix formulas for the more abstract derived formulas are given and additional geometric insights are developed with orthogonal projections and singular value decomposition.

40|$|This thesis {{research}} uses closed-loop pole {{analysis to}} study the dynamic behavior of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controlled feedback systems with time delay.
