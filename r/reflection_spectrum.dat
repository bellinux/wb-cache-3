50|$|The {{scattering}} {{and reflection}} spectra of a material {{are influenced by}} both its index of refraction and its absorption spectrum. In an optical context, the absorption spectrum is typically quantified by the extinction coefficient, and the extinction and index coefficients are quantitatively related through the Kramers-Kronig relation. Therefore, the absorption spectrum {{can be derived from}} a scattering or <b>reflection</b> <b>spectrum.</b> This typically requires simplifying assumptions or models, and so the derived absorption spectrum is an approximation.|$|E

50|$|Reflectivity is {{the ratio}} {{of the power of the}} {{reflected}} wave to that of the incident wave. It is a function of the wavelength of radiation, and is related to the refractive index of the material as expressed by Fresnel's equations. In regions of the electromagnetic spectrum in which absorption by the material is significant, it is related to the electronic absorption spectrum through the imaginary component of the complex refractive index. The electronic absorption spectrum of an opaque material, which is difficult or impossible to measure directly, may therefore be indirectly determined from the <b>reflection</b> <b>spectrum</b> by a Kramers-Kronig transform. The polarization of the reflected light depends on the symmetry of the arrangement of the incident probing light with respect to the absorbing transitions dipole moments in the material.|$|E
50|$|Many morpho {{butterflies}} are colored in metallic, shimmering {{shades of}} blues and greens. These colors {{are not a}} result of pigmentation, but are an example of iridescence through structural coloration. Specifically, the microscopic scales covering the morpho's wings reflect incident light repeatedly at successive layers, leading to interference effects that depend on both wavelength and angle of incidence/observance. Thus, the colors appear to vary with viewing angle, but they are actually surprisingly uniform, perhaps due to the tetrahedral (diamond-like) structural arrangement of the scales or diffraction from overlying cell layers. The wide-angle blue reflection property {{can be explained by}} exploring the nanostructures in the scales of the morpho butterfly wings. These optically active structures integrate three design principles leading to the wide-angle reflection: alternative lamellae layers, Christmas tree-like shape, and zigzag pattern of the ridges. The <b>reflection</b> <b>spectrum</b> is found to be broad (about 90 nm) for alternating layers and can be controlled by varying the design pattern. The Christmas tree-like pattern helps to reduce the directionality of the reflectance by creating an impedance matching for blue wavelengths. In addition, the zigzag pattern of ridges destroys the unwanted interference for other wavelengths in wide angle. This structure may be likened to a photonic crystal. The lamellate structure of their wing scales has been studied as a model in the development of biomimetic fabrics, dye-free paints, and anticounterfeit technology used in currency.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{authors have}} {{developed}} a novel technique to detect debonding in honeycomb sandwich structures using small-diameter fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. A small-diameter FBG sensor {{is embedded in the}} adhesive layer between the core and the facesheet during the curing process of the adhesive layer. After the curing process, the <b>reflection</b> <b>spectrum</b> from the small-diameter FBG sensor is distorted because the formation of fillets induces a non-uniform strain distribution in the adhesive layer. However, after debonding, the core with the fillets peels off the facesheet, and, as a result, the <b>reflection</b> <b>spectrum</b> recovers its original shape due to the release of the non-uniform strain. Debonding can thus be detected with high sensitivity in real time from the recovery {{in the shape of the}} <b>reflection</b> <b>spectrum.</b> In addition, a more reliable debonding detection technique using a small-diameter chirped FBG sensor is proposed, in which two indicators in the <b>reflection</b> <b>spectrum</b> have been successfully used for a more reliable judgment of debonding...|$|E

40|$|The relativistically-broadened <b>reflection</b> <b>spectrum,</b> {{observed}} in both AGN and X-ray binaries, {{has proven to}} be a powerful probe of the properties of black holes and the environments in which they reside. Being emitted from the inner-most regions of the accretion disk, this X-ray spectral component carries with it information not only about the plasma that resides in these extreme conditions, but also the black hole spin, a marker of the formation and accretion history of these objects. The models currently used to interpret the <b>reflection</b> <b>spectrum</b> are often simplistic, however, approximating the disk as an infinitely thin, optically thick plane of material orbiting in circular Keplerian orbits around the central object. Using a new relativistic ray tracing suite (Fenrir) that allows for more complex disk approximations, we examine the effects that disk thickness may have on the <b>reflection</b> <b>spectrum.</b> We find that finite disk thickness can have a variety of effects on the <b>reflection</b> <b>spectrum,</b> including a truncation of the blue wing (from self-shadowing of the accretion disk) and an enhancement of the red wing (from the irradiation of the central 'eye wall' of the inner disk). We make a first estimate on the systematic errors on black hole spin and height that may result from neglecting these effects. Comment: 19 pages, 10 figures, Submitted for publication in Ap...|$|E
