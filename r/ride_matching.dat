40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for a dynamic ridesharing {{mechanism}} using {{the combination of}} several modern information and communication technologies. The increased personal usage of automobiles has caused several undesirable consequences. Waste of time, fuel and effort due to traffic congestion and scarcity of parking areas are the most obvious. Ride-sharing for routine travelling has been an accepted practice {{in the developed world}} as a solution. However, today's travelling needs are more complex and therefore traditional ride-share systems are no longer adequate. The concept of instant ride-sharing has emerged consequently. The objective of the propose technology for instant <b>ride</b> <b>matching</b> between drivers and riders. Interaction between dedicated agents takes care of matching rides and possible uncertainties. Effective communication of users with the service provider is achieved through their mobile devices. The architecture of this system targets a robust rideshare application, which constantly takes care of users' ride requirements without the need for frequent interventions...|$|E
40|$|Ridesharing {{can save}} energy, reduce pollution, and {{alleviate}} congestion. Ridesharing systems allow peer-to-peer <b>ride</b> <b>matching</b> through mobile-phone applications. In many systems people have little {{information about the}} driver and co-riders. Trust heavily influences the usage of a ridesharing system, however, {{work in this area}} is limited. In this paper, we investigate the role of social media in shaping trust and delineate factors that influence the decisions of trust placed on a driver or co-rider. We design a ridesharing system where a rider can see the Instagram profile and 10 recent pictures of a co-rider and ask them to make judgments on six trust related questions. We discovered three important factors that shape trust forming: social proof, social approval, and self-disclosure. These three factors account for 40 %, 33 %, and 13 % of the variance, and subsequent factors extracted accounted for substantially less variance. Using these three factors, we successfully build a trust prediction model with F-measure of 87. 4 %, an improvement from 78. 6 % on using all factors collected.

40|$|Ride-sharing schemes {{attempt to}} reduce road traffic by {{matching}} prospective passengers to drivers with spare seats in their cars. To be successful, such schemes require {{a critical mass of}} drivers and passengers. In current deployed implementations, the possible matches are based on heuristics, rather than real route times or distances. In some cases, the heuristics propose infeasible matches; in others, feasible matches are omitted. Poor <b>ride</b> <b>matching</b> is likely to deter participants from using the system. We develop a constraint-based model for acceptable ride matches which incorporates route plans and time windows. Through data analytics on a history of advertised schedules and agreed shared trips, we infer parameters for this model that account for 90 % of agreed trips. By applying the inferred model to the advertised schedules, we demonstrate that there is an imbalance between riders and passengers. We assess the potential benefits of persuading existing drivers to switch to becoming passengers if appropriate matches can be found, by solving the inferred model with and without switching. We demonstrate that flexible participation has the potential {{to reduce the number of}} unmatched participants by up to 80 %...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the past}} few years, we have {{witnessed}} {{a rise in the}} popularity of ride-hailing services (RHSs), an on-line marketplace that enables accredited drivers to use their own cars to drive ride-hailing users. Unlike other transportation services, RHSs raise significant privacy concerns, as providers are able to track the precise mobility patterns of millions of riders worldwide. We present the first survey and analysis of the privacy threats in RHSs. Our analysis exposes high-risk privacy threats that do not occur in conventional taxi services. Therefore, we propose PrivateRide, a privacy-enhancing and practical solution that offers anonymity and location privacy for riders, and protects drivers' information from harvesting attacks. PrivateRide lowers the high-risk privacy threats in RHSs to a level that is at least as low as that of many taxi services. Using real data-sets from Uber and taxi rides, we show that PrivateRide significantly enhances riders' privacy, while preserving tangible accuracy in <b>ride</b> <b>matching</b> and fare calculation, with only negligible effects on convenience. Moreover, by using our Android implementation for experimental evaluations, we show that PrivateRide's overhead during ride setup is negligible. In short, we enable privacy-conscious riders to achieve levels of privacy that are not possible in current RHSs and even in some conventional taxi services, thereby offering a potential business differentiator...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} efficient {{solutions to}} maximize profit for commercial ridesharing services, under a pricing model with detour-based discounts for passengers. We propose greedy heuristics for real-time <b>ride</b> <b>matching</b> that offer different trade-offs between optimality and speed. Simulations on New York City (NYC) taxi trip {{data show that}} our heuristics are up to 90 % optimal and 10 ^ 5 {{times faster than the}} (necessarily) exponential-time optimal algorithm. Commercial ridesharing service providers generate significant savings by matching multiple ride requests using heuristic methods. The resulting savings are typically shared between the service provider (in the form of increased profit) and the ridesharing passengers (in the form of discounts). It is not clear a priori how this split should be effected, since higher discounts would encourage more ridesharing, thereby increasing total savings, but the fraction of savings taken as profit is reduced. We simulate a scenario where the decisions of the passengers to opt for ridesharing depend on the discount offered by the service provider. We provide an adaptive learning algorithm IDFLA that learns the optimal profit-maximizing discount factor for the provider. An evaluation over NYC data shows that IDFLA, on average, learns the optimal discount factor in under 16 iterations. Finally, we investigate the impact of imposing a detour-aware routing policy based on sequential individual rationality, a recently proposed concept. Such restricted policies offer a better ride experience, increasing the provider's market share, but at the cost of decreased average per-ride profit due to the reduced number of matched rides. We construct a model that captures these opposing effects, wherein simulations based on NYC data show that a 7 % increase in market share would suffice to offset the decreased average per-ride profit.
