5|$|The <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws was {{met with}} resentment and {{violence}} in Vincennes. An effigy of Jesse Bright was burnt in the street, and Rice Jones, a popular abolitionist, was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1812 {{agitation}} for <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orders in Council increased. After {{riots in}} Manchester in April, Perceval consented to a House of Commons enquiry into {{the operation of}} the Orders; hearings began in May. Perceval was expected to attend the session on 11 May 1812; among the crowd in the lobby awaiting his arrival was a Liverpool merchant, John Bellingham.|$|E
5|$|Many of Priestley's {{political}} writings {{supported the}} <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted {{the rights of}} Dissenters. They could not hold political office, serve in the armed forces, or attend Oxford and Cambridge unless they subscribed to the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England. Dissenters repeatedly petitioned Parliament to repeal the Acts, arguing {{that they were being}} treated as second-class citizens.|$|E

5|$|Ryan opposes {{same-sex}} marriage, {{had previously}} supported a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, opposed the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> don't ask, don't tell policy, voted against same-sex couples adopting children in Washington D.C., and voted against {{a bill that}} would expand federal hate crime laws to cover offenses based on a victim's sexual orientation. Unlike most of his fellow Republicans, Ryan voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in 2007, which would have prohibited employment {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression and the {{election}} of Democratic party candidates in 1932 ended widespread national support for Prohibition. Franklin D. Roosevelt, who included <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eighteenth Amendment as a major issue of his presidential campaign in 1932, made good on his promise to American voters. On December 5, 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and ended nationwide Prohibition. However, Indiana's legislature continued to regulate alcohol within the state through allocation of state liquor licenses and prohibition of sales on Sunday.|$|E
5|$|The President of the Board of Trade, William Gladstone, {{resigned}} from the cabinet over the Maynooth Grant. The Corn Laws imposed a tariff on imported wheat, protecting British farmers from foreign competition, but making the cost of bread artificially high. Peel hoped that the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corn Laws and the resultant influx of cheaper wheat into Britain would relieve {{the condition of the}} poor, and in particular the suffering caused by successive failure of potato crops in Ireland—the Great Famine.|$|E
50|$|Bikalpa Dhara opposed <b>the</b> <b>repealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thirteenth Amendment that {{abolished}} the caretaker government system in Bangladesh, and stated their liking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{system to the}} Chief Election Commissioner during a formal dialogue. The party also has agreed to join former foe BNP in a movement to reinstate the caretaker government.|$|R
25|$|On 21 January 1659 Elizabeth Lilburne petitioned Richard Cromwell for <b>the</b> {{discharge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fine {{imposed on}} her husband by <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> 30 Jan. 1652, and her request was granted. Parliament on a similar petition recommended <b>the</b> <b>repealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> act, and the recommendation was carried by the restored Long Parliament on 15 August 1659.|$|R
2500|$|After <b>the</b> {{financial}} crisis <b>of</b> 2007–2008, some commentators argued that <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> Sections 20 and 32 had {{played an important}} role in leading to the housing bubble and {{financial crisis}}. Economics Nobel prize laureate Joseph Stiglitz, for instance, argued that [...] "hen <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> Glass-Steagall brought investment and commercial banks together, the investment-bank culture came out on top", and banks which had previously been managed conservatively turned to riskier investments to increase their returns. Another laureate, Paul Krugman, contended that <b>the</b> <b>repealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> act [...] "was indeed a mistake"; however, it was not <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial crisis.|$|R
5|$|The Ryan White CARE Act was set {{to expire}} on September 30, 2009, {{although}} efforts began to obtain an extension to the act. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 was signed on October 30, 2009 by President Barack Obama, who announced that implementation was progressing on <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ban on travel and immigration to the U.S. by individuals with HIV that had been passed by Congress.|$|E
5|$|The {{inaugural meeting}} of the Women's Franchise League (WFL) was held on 25 July 1889, at the Pankhurst home in Russell Square. William Lloyd Garrison spoke at the meeting, warning the {{audience}} that the US abolition movement had been hampered by individuals advocating moderation and patience. Early members of the WFL included Josephine Butler, leader of the Ladies National Association for the <b>Repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Contagious Diseases Acts; the Pankhursts' friend Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy; and Harriot Eaton Stanton Blatch, daughter of US suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} {{criminal}} cases, the Supreme Court held (in 1896) that Judiciary Act of 1891 operated as an implied <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authorization to hear cases on certificates of division. But, the Court retained its authority hear civil cases via certificates of division until {{the abolition of}} the circuit courts by the Judicial Code of 1911. A different, and rarely used, certified question procedure was adopted in 1925 and is currently codified at 28 U.S.C. § 1254(2).|$|E
2500|$|PNŢ-CD {{strongly}} opposed <b>the</b> <b>repealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article. Its leader, Corneliu Coposu, argued that its Christian stance led it [...] "to combat every deviation from <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> nature and from <b>the</b> moral principles <b>of</b> a future balanced society", while deputy Emil Popescu said that [...] "incest was preferable to homosexuality {{since at least}} the former preserved <b>the</b> chance <b>of</b> procreation".|$|R
50|$|Iemma {{immediately}} faced {{a number}} of resignations. Deputy Premier and Treasurer Andrew Refshauge, and senior minister Craig Knowles, once considered a potential leader himself, both declared they would leave politics. Iemma took the Treasury portfolio for himself. Among his first policy moves as new Premier, Iemma announced <b>the</b> immediate <b>repealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vendor tax (a tax on investment property) that was introduced by the Carr government in 2003.|$|R
50|$|Another {{trend is}} to stage earlier and earlier primaries, given impetus by Super Tuesday and the mid-1990s move (since <b>repealed)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> California primary and its bloc of votes—the {{largest in the}} nation—from June to March. To retain its {{tradition}} as the first primary in the country (and adhere to a state law which requires it to be), New Hampshire moved their primary forward, from early March to early January.|$|R
5|$|After {{some initial}} resistance, the Duke yields to Süß's {{request for the}} <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law prohibiting Jews from living in Württemberg; a horde of dirty, disreputable Jews are then shown moving into the city. Süß enables them to enrich {{themselves}} {{at the expense of}} the populace. The aged Rabbi Loew (Werner Krauss) criticizes Süß for his excessively opulent lifestyle as the Duke's finance minister and warns that it could be his downfall, warning that, “The Lord punishes Jews who forget who they are!” but Süß pays him no heed.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new duties on various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them. Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E
500|$|The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network {{was founded}} as a nonprofit legal services, watchdog, and policy {{organization}} {{founded in the}} United States in 1993. The organization was dedicated to ending discrimination and harassment {{of gay and lesbian}} U.S. military personnel. [...] Lady Gaga received the Randy Shilts Visibility Award in 2011, for raising the [...] "Don't Ask, Don’t Tell" [...] campaign to the public and for actively supporting <b>the</b> <b>repealing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law in 2010.|$|R
50|$|However, Parliament may {{theoretically}} {{withdraw from}} commitments {{it has made}} or <b>repeal</b> any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constraints it has imposed {{on its ability to}} legislate.|$|R
25|$|Sullivan {{was barred}} {{for many years}} from {{applying}} for United States citizenship because of his HIV-positive status. Following the statutory and administrative <b>repeals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HIV immigration ban in 2008 and 2009, respectively, he announced his intention to begin <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> becoming a permanent resident and citizen. On The Chris Matthews Show on 16 April 2011, Sullivan confirmed that {{he had become a}} permanent resident, showing his green card. On 1 December 2016, Sullivan became a naturalized American citizen.|$|R
5|$|By early 1896, {{many in the}} Democratic Party were bitterly {{opposed to}} President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by then {{in the third year}} of a deep recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm {{supporter}} of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman's act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman strike, led to the Democrats losing control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.|$|E
5|$|Finally in 1909, Stanley {{attached}} {{his proposed}} <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tobacco tax as a rider to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act. The bill passed the House, but the Senate stripped Stanley's provision. Kentucky Senator Ollie M. James reintroduced the repeal into the Senate {{version of the}} bill, and it survived when the bill was passed into law. The repeal resulted in higher tobacco prices, and although Stanley had not been alone in getting the repeal passed, he received much of the credit. In 1911, Stanley's fight against the American Tobacco Company bore fruit, as the Supreme Court ruled the company to be in violation of antitrust laws and broke it into separate companies. Both the tax repeal and the breakup of American Tobacco helped quell the violence perpetrated by the Night Riders.|$|E
5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E
50|$|Article 2 {{formerly}} {{defined the}} state boundaries; after <b>the</b> 1990 <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> section 3, <b>the</b> legislature holds {{the power to}} define the state boundaries.|$|R
50|$|A {{company would}} create a superannuation fund, with an {{associate}} as the trustee. The company paid money into the fund, ostensibly for <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> particular employees. Under section 82AAE (now <b>repealed)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 such contributions were tax deductible (to a limit of 5% of initial salary or $400, whichever was greater). But <b>the</b> trustee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fund would immediately lend the money back to the company on favourable terms, such as a low interest rate and unsecured. So the company got a tax deduction but kept its money.|$|R
2500|$|Connolly {{supports}} gay rights, having campaigned {{against the}} Marshall-Newman Amendment to the Virginia Constitution, which banned all gay unions from being performed or recognized in Virginia. In Congress, he {{voted in favor}} <b>of</b> <b>repealing</b> <b>the</b> contentious [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" [...] law that prohibited gays from serving openly in the military, and has co-sponsored a few bills that would <b>repeal</b> portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Federal Defense <b>of</b> Marriage Act.|$|R
5|$|Garrow {{also became}} {{involved}} in the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corn Laws, voting for the measure, and sponsored legislation to control surgical practice in the United Kingdom; the bill did not, however, pass into law. In the early 19th century animal cruelty was widespread; Garrow {{was one of those who}} found it appalling, and sponsored a bill in 1816 to increase the penalties for riding horses until their severe injury or death. While defeated, his actions were vindicated by a bill of 1820 introduced by Thomas Erskine, which was given the Royal Assent and came into law. Garrow eventually resigned as Attorney General and as a member of parliament in 1817, when he was appointed one of the Barons of the Exchequer.|$|E
5|$|In {{his address}} to the state {{legislature}} in January 1898, Bradley advocated the <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state's Separate Coach Law, which provided separate streetcars for whites and blacks. He appointed substantial numbers of blacks to patronage positions in government beyond the janitorial jobs they usually received. He named Edward E. Underwood as the first black person {{on the board of}} trustees for Kentucky State College (later the University of Kentucky). Because of his devotion to black advancement, Bradley was the only white person included in William Decker Johnson's 1897 compilation Biographical Sketches of Prominent Negro Men and Women of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln ran for {{election}} as governor {{in his own}} right in 1809, but he was perceived by moderate Federalists as overly partisan and lacked the charisma of Sullivan. His support for Jefferson's economic policy, particularly that of embargoing trade with Great Britain and France (who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars) was costly. Federalists, who had regained control of the Massachusetts legislature in 1808, attacked his statements in support of Jefferson, and he lost the election to Christopher Gore, amid a complete Federalist takeover of the Massachusetts government (the outgoing Jefferson administration's <b>repeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embargo before the election notwithstanding).|$|E
50|$|Following <b>the</b> {{handing out}} <b>of</b> several {{controversial}} penalties and extensive debate over <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> amendments to <b>the</b> sporting regulations, <b>the</b> FIA <b>repealed</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rules restricting pit-to-car communications.|$|R
50|$|Corazon Aquino <b>repealed</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> repressive {{laws that}} had been enacted during Marcos's dictatorship. She {{restored}} <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> access to habeas corpus, repealed anti-labor laws and freed hundreds of political prisoners.|$|R
