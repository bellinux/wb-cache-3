40|$|Fish {{consumption}} {{is a potential}} <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>exposure</b> to the hepatotoxic microcystins, especially in lakes and reservoirs that routinely experience significant toxic Microcystis blooms. Understanding the rates of uptake and elimination for microcystins {{as well as the}} transfer efficiency into tissues of consumers are important for determining the potential for microcystins to be transferred up the food web and for predicting potential human health impacts. The main objective of this work was to conduct laboratory experiments to investigate the kinetics of toxin accumulation in fish tissue. An oral route of exposure was employed in this study, in which juvenile yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were given a single oral dose of 5 or 20 μg of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) via food and accumulation in the muscle, liver, and tank water were measured over 24 h. Peak concentrations of the water soluble fraction of microcystin were generally observed 8 – 10 h after dosing in the liver and after 12 – 16 h in the muscle, with a rapid decline in both tissues by 24 h. Up to 99 % of the total recoverable (i. e., unbound) microcystin was measured in the tank water by 16 h after exposure. The relatively rapid uptake and elimination of the unbound fraction of microcystin in the liver and muscle of juvenile yellow perch within 24 h of exposure indicates that fish consumption may not be a major <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>exposure</b> to microcystin, particularly in the Great Lakes...|$|E

In addition, some PFASs can impair different metabolic functions, thus posing a risk to human health, especially during the early stages of life. Despite recent scientific and regulatory attention, most of the data available thus far on PFASs come from studies of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), although both compounds have largely been replaced by other shorterbut also longer-chain compounds, some of which can be degraded to PFOA and PFOS.

The first step in the metabolic deg-radation of NDEA by cytochrome oxidase (CYPs) enzymes is the introduction of a hydroxyl group and in human esophage and liver CYP 2 A 3 and CYP 2 E 1 participate on this metabolism. Measuring cytotoxic-ity in female rat primary hepatocytes cultures, were used to understand the CYP induction and metaboli-zation correlated with low NDEA concentrations. W...|$|R
40|$|Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) {{are manufactured}} worldwide {{in large quantities}} {{for use in a}} wide range of applications. TiO 2 NPs possess different physicochemical properties compared to their fine particle (FP) analogs, which might alter their bioactivity. Most of the literature cited here has focused on the respiratory system, showing the importance of inhalation as the primary route for TiO 2 NP exposure in the workplace. TiO 2 NPs may translocate to systemic organs from the lung and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) although the rate of translocation appears low. There have also been studies focusing on other potential <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>exposure.</b> Oral exposure mainly occurs through food products containing TiO 2 NP-additives. Most dermal exposure studies, whether in vivo or in vitro, report that TiO 2 NPs do not penetrate the stratum corneum (SC). In the field of nanomedicine, intravenous injection can deliver TiO 2 nanoparticulate carriers directly into the human body. Upon intravenous exposure, TiO 2 NPs can induce pathological lesions of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and brain. We have also shown here that most of these effects may be due to the use of very high doses of TiO 2 NPs. There is also an enormous lack of epidemiological data regarding TiO 2 NPs in spite of its increased production and use. However, long-term inhalation studies in rats have reported lung tumors. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the toxicology of TiO 2 NPs and points out areas where further information is needed...|$|R
40|$|Incidences of Staphylococcus aureus and {{methicillin}} resistant S. aureus (MRSA) {{have risen}} worldwide prompting {{a need to}} better understand <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>exposure</b> and whether standard bacterial water quality monitoring practices adequately account for this potential threat. Beach water and sand samples were analyzed during summer months for S. aureus, enterococci, and MRSA at three southern California beaches (Avalon, Doheny, Malibu Surfrider). S. aureus frequently was detected in samples of seawater (59 %, n = 328) and beach sand (53 %, n = 358). MRSA sometimes was detected in seawater (1. 6 %, n = 366) and sand (2. 7 %, n = 366) at relatively low concentrations. Site specific differences were observed, with Avalon Beach presenting the highest concentrations of S. aureus and Malibu Surfrider the lowest in both seawater and sand. S. aureus concentrations in seawater and sand were correlated {{to each other and}} to a variety of other parameters. Multiple linear regression on the combined beach data indicated that significant explanatory variables for S. aureus in seawater were S. aureus in sand, water temperature, enterococci in seawater, and the number of swimmers. In sand, S. aureus concentrations were related to S. aureus in seawater, water temperature, enterococci in seawater, and inversely to surf height classification. Only the correlation to water temperature held for individually analyzed beaches and for S. aureus concentrations in both seawater and sand. To provide context for these results, the prevalence of S. aureus in sand was compared to published fomite studies, and results suggested that beach prevalence was similar to that in homes...|$|R
