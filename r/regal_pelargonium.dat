5000|$|Pelargonium 'Clorinda' - A hybrid between P.quercifolium and {{an unknown}} <b>regal</b> <b>pelargonium.</b> It has sweet, very {{aromatic}} oak shaped leaves. Its large pink flowers are {{courtesy of the}} regal in its parentage {{and it goes on}} flowering for months (spring - summer).|$|E
50|$|There are a {{group of}} 7 pelargoniums bred by Edna Popperwell (UK plantswoman) which all have P.quercifolium and a <b>Regal</b> <b>Pelargonium</b> in their parentage. They range in scents from Almond/Cedar like P.quercifolium to Mint and Rose. They are 'Ashby' (Rose Scented), 'Brunswick' (Cedar), 'Copthorne' (Cedar), Fairlop (Mint/Spicy), 'Hemley', 'Orsett' and 'Welling' (All Sweetly scented).|$|E

25|$|Unique in {{sense of}} not fitting {{into any of}} the above categories. The {{parentage}} of Unique pelargoniums is confused and obscure. One theory being a derivation from P.fulgidum, but a derivation from an older cultivar 'Old Unique’, also known as or ‘Rollinson’s Crimson’, in the mid-19th century is also claimed. Unique pelargoniums resemble upright Scented Leaf pelargoniums in being shrubby and woody evergreens. They have distinctly scented leaves, and small flowers with blotched and feathered petals. They may have bicolour foliage. Some types, popularly known in the hobby as hybrid Uniques, have been crossed with <b>Regal</b> <b>pelargoniums</b> and, {{as a result of this}} cross, are much more floriferous.|$|R

40|$|Studies on {{the biology}} of {{geranium}} bronze butterfly were conducted in Milan (nothern Italy) on Pelargonium spp. from April {{to the end of}} December, observing directly the presence of adult, larvae eggs or damage. To test the susceptibility to the attack of the butterfly, 40 different ornamental geraniums were used (see the table) : 10 cvs of zonal pelargoniums (Pelargonium × hortorum); 3 cvs of ivy-leafed pelargoniums (P. peltatum); 3 cvs of <b>regal</b> <b>pelargoniums</b> (P. × domesticum); and 16 species or cvs of scented-leafed pelargoniums. The plants were exposed to the pest from the end of May to the end of September, in two different localities. The plants were observed every week, and data on damage and their symptomatology were collected. Different cvs of Pelargonium Larvae on cv Lady plymout...|$|R
25|$|There {{was little}} attempt at any {{rational}} grouping of Pelargonium cultivars, the growing {{of which was}} revived in the mid twentieth century, and the origins of many if not most were lost in obscurity. In 1916 the American botanist Liberty Hyde Bailey (1858–1954) introduced two new terms for zonal and <b>regal</b> <b>pelargoniums.</b> Those pelargoniums which were largely derived from P.zonale he referred to as P.×hortorum (i.e. from the garden), while those from P.cucullatum he named P.×domesticum (i.e. from the home). In the late 1950s a list (the Spalding List) was produced in the United States, based on nursery listings and the 1897 list of Henri Dauthenay. It described seven groups, listing each cultivar with the list of its originator, {{and in most cases}} a date. These were Species, Zonals, Variegated-Leaved, Domesticum (Regals), Ivy-Leaved, Scented-Leaved and Old. In the 1970s the British Pelargonium and Geranium Society produced a checklist and the Australian Geranium Society started to produce a register but it was not completed till its author, Jean Llewellyn's death in 1999. None of these were published. The most complete list in its time was the 2001 compilation by The Geraniaceae Group, which included all cultivars up to 1959.|$|R

2500|$|Angel pelargoniums {{are similar}} to <b>Regal</b> <b>pelargoniums</b> but more closely {{resemble}} P.crispum in leaf shape and growth habit. The majority of Angel cultivars originate from a cross between P.crispum and a Regal variety {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. Angels have grown in popularity in the last 30 years or so due mainly to an explosion of new varieties being released by specialist nurseries resulting from the work done by dedicated amateur hybridisers. These hybrisers have managed to obtain many new flower colour breaks and tighter growth habits resulting in plants suitable for all sorts of situations. Angels basically have the appearance of a small Regal with small serrated leaves and much smaller flowers and are more compact and bushy. The group extends to include similar small-leaved and -flowered types but usually with P.crispum in their parentage. They are mostly upright bush-type plants but there are some lax varieties that can be used for basket or hanging pot cultivation. Often called [...] "pansy-faced" [...] in the US. Some varieties have bicolour foliage. Other terms include ‘Langley-Smith Hybrids’.|$|R
