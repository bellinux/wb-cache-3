5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{is situated}} on a hillock. There are 70 masonry steps {{to reach the}} tower. The Lighthouse is an unattended station. A rain water tank and a rest room have been provided for the maintenance staff.A third order <b>revolving</b> <b>optic,</b> on a mercury trough with DA (dissolved acetylene) gas burner and gas motor to revolve the optic, all supplied by M/s BBT, Paris were installed inside the lantern house over the CI tower [...] The light was commissioned on 14 April 1969. Due to frequent failures of the rotation system, the <b>revolving</b> <b>optic</b> assembly was removed and a 500 mm cut-and-polished drum optic was placed in position in 1978. The DA gas burner {{was replaced by a}} DA gas flasher with sun valve. This reduced the consumption of DA gas but the intensity of the light went down.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, the {{installation}} of a 4th Order electrically operated <b>revolving</b> <b>optic</b> replaced the original 2nd Order optic with a pressurised vapour kerosene [...] "Hood" [...] mantle burner. The light source was changed to a 100-volt/1,000-watt incandescent bulb producing 350,000 candelas of light intensity with a visibility range of [...] The power supply came {{from one of the}} three generators installed in a generator room built close to the keeper's room. As the rotation was electrically driven by motors, the crew was reduced to four men.|$|E
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was further}} modernised in 1914: a new <b>revolving</b> <b>optic</b> was installed (which remained in use for 99 years), {{and a new}} additional light was installed along with fixed lenses at a level below the lantern, so the sector lights now shone from windows on the tower. The lighthouse was electrified in 1959, and in 1964 it became the first lighthouse to be monitored by telemetry from Harwich, ushering {{in a process of}} lighthouse automation which continued around England over the next 35 years. The keepers were withdrawn from Orfordness the following year.|$|E
50|$|A new {{aluminium}} tower {{came into}} operation on 1969-12-02, about 100 metres {{from the previous}} lighthouse. The fully automatic <b>revolving</b> electric <b>optic</b> is powered by triple mutual diesel/alternator sets. The lighthouse is monitored at Cape Columbine.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the main}} {{buildings}} were completed in 1875, the site {{did not become}} operational until 1878. The original light characteristic consisted of six or seven flashes of white light within sixteen seconds every minute. This {{was due to the}} operation of a <b>revolving</b> octagonal <b>optic,</b> combined with a light powered by coal gas burners that were switched on and off every two seconds or so. With a range of [...] in clear conditions, {{it was one of the}} most powerful lights of its time.|$|R
50|$|Three single-wick lamps {{fitted with}} {{parabolic}} reflectors were used. Incandescent oil dioptric light with ‘Hood’ burner {{was used in}} 1931 with a 3rd Order 500 mm optic. (The Order is a system of classifying the type of lenses used based on the focal length of the lens). This <b>optic</b> <b>revolved</b> on mercury, producing an intensity of 670,000 candelas with a visibility range of 22 nautical miles (about 40 km). This kerosene burning lighting equipment was replaced in 1967 by an electrically operated 100-volt/1,000-watt light source. A generator room {{was built on the}} east side of the lighthouse to house three generators. With the generators, the seven-men lighthouse crew was reduced to four.|$|R
5000|$|Alappuzha, {{the place}} where India's Alleppey Lighthouse stands, {{was one of the}} busiest ports and trade centers of Kerala. Alappuzha, a part of Travancore, was ruled by Rajas of Erstwhile Travancore before India's independence. After the arrival of the Portuguese, Dutch and English traders, Vizhinjam, Kollam, Travancore and Purakad were the main ports of Erstwhile Travancore through which foreign trade flourished. The decline of the Port of Purakkad necessitated the {{rehabilitation}} of the traders for which Alappuzha was selected as a port and an infrastructure was developed. The port was opened to foreign traders in 1792. There was no regular lighthouse provided in the 18th century-only a light, provided on the pier head served the mariners. As port activities increased, the authorities had to provide for a lighthouse. The construction of the present lighthouse began in the reign of His Highness Marthanda Varma-II Maharaja (ruler of Travancore) and was completed during the reign of His Highness Rama Varma Maharaja of Travancore. The first stone was laid by Mrs. Mough Crawford on April 26, 1860. The 30' high lighthouse has a teak spiral staircase. A 1st order optical equipment with coconut oil double wick lamp light-source supplied by M/s. Chance Bros. Birmingham was installed and commissioned into service on 28 March 1862. The same equipment continued to serve till 1952 when it was replaced by 500 mm drum optic and DA gas flasher of AGA make. The current 4th order optic with a 1000 watt electric lamp was installed in 1960. The mains supply was extended to the station in 1960, this enabled the installation of an electrically operated 4th order <b>revolving</b> <b>optic</b> system supplied by M/s BBT, Paris, this replaced the old equipment and was commissioned on 4 August 1960. The direct drive system was incorporated on 8 April 1998 and a separate emergency light in 300 mm lantern on 30 December 1998. The incandescent lamp was replaced by 230V 150W Metal halide lamp on 28 February 1999. The lighthouse is still a manned station. and ...|$|E
