40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{document}} the perceived and actual mental health and <b>substance</b> abuse issues <b>of</b> residents living on a remote reservation in the Northwestern United States. Surveys were completed by 138 Native Americans, who reported on mental health status and problems, perceptions of personal and community health issues on the <b>reservation,</b> and patterns <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use and abuse (e. g., how often respondents use alcohol, what drugs present the most serious problems on the reservation). The respondents perceived their own mental health to be quite good. However, they reported that several mental health problems were prevalent in their community including alcohol/drug abuse, mood disorders, and spousal abuse/domestic violence. In addition, although respondents themselves reported little substance abuse, the most serious perceived problems in both their families and the community were related to substance abuse. Respondents not only recognized the problems caused by substance abuse on the reservation; they also had valuable suggestions for how to reduce this problem, including recreational/after school programs, education about substance abuse, cultural activities, and appropriate treatment services, including traditional or faith-based healing methods...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{decision}} of the Court of Appeal in the Romalpa case in the mid 1970 's there has been an ever growing use <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> property (Romalpa) clauses in commercial contracts for the sale of goods. The concept <b>of</b> a <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> property clause is grounded in sections 19 and 21 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 but its widespread use is a recent phenomenon. The problem to be addressed here concerns the relationship of such clauses to the Chattels Transfer Act 1924. The question is whether such clauses fall within the ambit of the definition in section 2 of the Chattels Transfer Act of "instrument" or the exclusions from the term "instrument". If they fall within the latter then they are exempt from the registration provisions of the Chattels Transfer Act. If this is so, it enables those purchasing on such terms to give a misleading impression <b>of</b> their <b>substance</b> to other creditors who may extend credit facilities in reliance on what appears to be ownership by the purchaser of substantial stock in trade. In the event of the purchaser's bankruptcy, the supplier under a contract containing a <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> property clause can recover his goods possibly leaving very little property to be realised {{for the benefit of the}} unsecured creditors...|$|R
