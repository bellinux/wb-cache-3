We know several technologies and materials used for cleaning the sludge deposits, iron and manganese oxides, dross, stone, etc. de {{on the inner}} walls of drinking water pipes or industries. For the oil industry, methods of removal of waste materials and waste pipes and liquid and gas transport networks are operations known long, tedious and expensive. The main methods and associated problems can be summarized as follows: 1) Blowing with compressed air. 2) manual or mechanical brushing, sanding with water or dry. 3) Wash with water jet of high pressure, solvent or chemical solution to remove the stone and hard deposits. 4) The combined methods of cleaning machines that use water jets, <b>cutters,</b> chains, <b>rotary</b> <b>heads</b> <b>cutters,</b> etc...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>cutter</b> {{is a tool}} {{generally}} used by quilters to cut fabric. It {{consists of}} a handle with a circular blade that rotates, thus the tool's name. <b>Rotary</b> <b>cutter</b> blades are very sharp, can be resharpened, and are available in different sizes: usually smaller blades are used to cut small curves, while larger blades are used to cut to straight lines and broad curves. Several layers of fabric can be cut simultaneously with a sharp (fresh) blade, {{making it easier to}} cut out patchwork pieces of the same shape and size than with scissors. Quilters use <b>rotary</b> <b>cutters</b> with specially designed templates and rulers made of approximately 1/8-inch thick clear or color-tinted plastic.|$|R

5000|$|The first <b>rotary</b> <b>cutter</b> was {{introduced}} by the Olfa company in 1979 for garment making, however, it was quickly adopted by quilters. Prior to {{the invention of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>cutter,</b> quilters traced handmade templates of the necessary shapes onto the wrong side of fabric and added 1/4-inch seam allowances all around. Templates were often handmade of (cereal box type) cardboard and the pencil wore down the edges with repeated tracings, rendering them inaccurate; new templates would be made several times until all the patchwork pieces were cut. Pieces were usually cut one at a time with dressmaking scissors, which were often heavy and had long blades that were designed for cutting large pieces for garments but were cumbersome to use for cutting small pieces for patchwork. The <b>rotary</b> <b>cutter</b> gained almost immediate widespread use among quilters after its introduction and, along with the accompanying development of strip techniques, revolutionized quilting.|$|R

25|$|With {{large-scale}} projects like quilts, {{it is often}} advantageous to have a <b>rotary</b> <b>cutter</b> and mat. A <b>rotary</b> <b>cutter</b> is a cutting tool with a round blade, {{making it easy to}} cut a smooth, continuous line. <b>Rotary</b> <b>cutters</b> come with different sized blades: a larger blade is useful for large projects with straight lines, while a smaller blade is helpful for small areas or curved lines. A rotary mat protects tables and surfaces from the blade, while also protecting the cutting edge from damage. A quilting ruler can also be used, to help ensure that all pieces are cut to consistent sizes. Quilting rulers are made of clear plastic and have marked grid-lines {{across the surface of the}} ruler. This type of ruler makes it possible to cut a piece of fabric in the correct width or length without having to use a measuring tape and fabric chalk.

In order to prevent some geological and geotechnical hazards during tunneling, selecting the most appropriate tunneling machine is very important. In this research study the main geotechnical hazards of tunneling by roadheader with their common mitigation measures are discussed.
