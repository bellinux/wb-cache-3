5|$|Unlike the oval-shaped {{eye socket}} of Tanystropheus, the eye socket of Dinocephalosaurus {{appears to be}} peach-shaped, with a narrow {{anterior}} end. On {{the top of the}} skull, the parietal is broad and flattened, bearing no trace of the midline crest found in Tanystropheus. The jugal only has two processes, missing the third backward-projecting process present in most other reptiles. Also missing are the retroarticular process of the posterior (<b>rear)</b> <b>lower</b> jaw (another point of distinction from Tanystropheus), as well as additional teeth and a cavity between the pterygoid bones on the palate.|$|E
25|$|Newly {{available}} for the Mustang GT for 2010 were two performance packages. The 3.73 Axle Package featured higher performance front brake pads, a more aggressive 3.73:1 rear axle, and a recalibrated AdvanceTrac system. The Track Package featured higher performance front and rear brake pads, stabilizer bars and <b>rear</b> <b>lower</b> control arms from the GT500, uniquely tuned shocks and struts, Pirelli summer tires (includes automatic upgrade to 19-inch wheels), a 3.73:1 rear axle with carbon plates in the differential, and a recalibrated AdvanceTrac system.|$|E
25|$|The holotype, HMNH 001 (later HMNS 14), {{was found}} in the Windy Hill Member, stratigraphic zone 1 of the lower Morrison Formation, dating from the early Kimmeridgian, about 156 million years old. In 2001, it {{represented}} the oldest known American stegosaur. It consists of a nearly complete skull and much of the skeleton. It includes the disarticulated elements of the skull, the <b>rear</b> <b>lower</b> jaws, an hyoid, thirteen neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae, three sacrals, forty-four tail vertebrae, neck ribs, dorsal ribs, chevrons, a left shoulderblade, a complete pelvis, ossified tendons and ten neck and back plates. The skeleton was partly articulated and, in view of healed fractures, belongs to an old individual. It was obtained by the Japanese Hayashibara Museum of Natural Science at Okayama.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rear</b> admiral (<b>lower</b> half) is a one-star flag officer, {{with the}} pay grade of O-7 in the United States Navy, the United States Coast Guard, the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps. The {{abbreviation}} for personnel from the USN, USCG, and NOAA is RDML, whereas for the USPHS, the rank abbreviation is RADM. <b>Rear</b> admiral (<b>lower</b> half) ranks above captain and below rear admiral. <b>Rear</b> admiral (<b>lower</b> half) {{is equivalent to}} the rank of brigadier general in the other uniformed services, and equivalent to the rank of commodore in most other navies. In the United States uniformed services, <b>rear</b> admiral (<b>lower</b> half) replaced the rank of commodore in 1983.|$|R

500|$|On 27 May 1768, Cook took {{command of}} Earl of Pembroke, valued in March at £2,307. 5s. 6d. but {{ultimately}} purchased for £2,840. 10s. 11d. and assigned {{for use in}} the Society's expedition. She was refitted at Deptford on the River Thames for the sum of £2,294, almost the price of the ship itself. The hull was sheathed and caulked to protect against shipworm, and a third internal deck installed to provide cabins, a powder magazine and storerooms. The new cabins provided around [...] of floorspace apiece and were allocated to Cook and the Royal Society representatives: naturalist Joseph Banks, Banks' assistants Daniel Solander and Herman Spöring, astronomer Charles Green, and artists Sydney Parkinson and Alexander Buchan. These cabins encircled the officer's mess. The Great Cabin {{at the rear of the}} deck was designed as a workroom for Cook and the Royal Society. On the <b>rear</b> <b>lower</b> deck, cabins facing on to the mate's mess were assigned to Lieutenants Zachary Hickes and John Gore, ship's surgeon William Monkhouse, the gunner Stephen Forwood, ship's master Robert Molyneux, and the captain's clerk Richard Orton. The adjoining open mess deck provided sleeping and living quarters for the marines and crew, and additional storage space.|$|E
500|$|The forward {{fuselage}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, with a fully glazed nose. Early variants were labelled the [...] "flying pencil" [...] owing to its sleek and continuous [...] "stick-like" [...] lines. As {{a result of}} the lessons learned in the Spanish Civil War, the cockpit roof was raised and the lower, or bottom half, of the crew compartment was a typical under-nose [...] "Bodenlafette" [...] (abbreviated Bola) inverted-casemate design ventral defensive armament position, a common feature of most German medium bombers. The Bola was extended back to {{the leading edge of the}} wings where the lower-rear gunners position and upper-rear gunner position were level with each other. As with contemporary German bombers, the crew were concentrated in a single compartment. The cockpit layout consisted of the pilot seat and front gunner in the forward part of the cockpit. The pilot sat on the left side, close up to the Plexiglas windshield. One of the gunners sat on the right seat, which was set further back to provide room for the [...] MG 15 machine gun to be traversed in use. The Do 17 usually carried a crew of four: the pilot, a bombardier and two gunners. The bomb-aimer also manned the MG 15 in the nose glazing and Bola-housed <b>rear</b> <b>lower</b> position. The two gunners operated the forward-firing MG 15 installed in the front windshield, the two MGs located in the side windows (one each side) and the rearward firing weapon. The cockpit offered a bright and panoramic view at high altitude. The standard ammunition load was 3,300 rounds of 7,92mm ammunition in 44 double-drum magazines.|$|E
2500|$|A new sports-oriented model, the AMX, was {{introduced}} to appeal to young, performance-oriented car buyers. The AMX was available only as a hatchback with the six or the V8 engine (automatic only) featuring a floor-shifted four-speed manual or automatic transmission. Standard was an upgraded black or tan interior with a floor console, [...] "rally" [...] instrumentation with tachometer, and [...] "soft-feel" [...] sports steering wheel. The special [...] "Hornet AMX" [...] was only available in four exterior colors that included matching painted bumpers with a wraparound rubber guard strip, body side rubber guard strip and contrasting AMX model identification bodyside decals ahead of the rear wheels. The exterior included a front spoiler integrated into the front lower fender extensions, <b>rear</b> <b>lower</b> fender flares, sport-styled road wheels, brushed aluminum [...] "Targa top" [...] band over the B-pillars and roof, black left and right outside mirrors, and louvers for the rear hatch window. Options included bright aluminum road wheels and large Hornet-graphic decals on the hood and on the decklid. This model marked the return of a famous name that evoked AMC's original AMX two-seat sports car.|$|E
