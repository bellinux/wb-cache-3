25|$|As f {{decreases}} progressively during condensation, {{the remaining}} vapor {{becomes more and}} more depleted of the heavy isotopes, and the magnitude of depletion becomes larger as f approaches zero. The <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>distillation</b> process can explain some first-order spatial patterns observed in the isotopic composition of precipitation across the globe, including isotopic depletion from the tropics to the poles, isotopic depletion from coastal to inland regions, and isotopic depletion with elevation over a mountain range, all of which are associated with progressive moisture loss during transport. The <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>distillation</b> model {{can also be used to}} explain the strong correlation between δD and δ18O observed in global precipitation, expressed as the global meteoric water line (GMWL): δD=8δ18O+10 (later updated to δD=8.17±0.07 δ18O+11.27±0.65) The slope of the GMWL reflects the relative magnitude of hydrogen and oxygen isotope fractionation during condensation. It should be noted that the intercept of GMWL is non-zero (called deuterium-excess, or d-excess), which means ocean water does fall on GMWL. This is associated with the kinetic isotope effect during evaporation when water vapor diffuses from the saturated boundary layer to the unsaturated transition zone, and cannot be explained by the Rayleigh model. Nevertheless, the robust pattern in GMWL strongly suggests a single dominant moisture source to the global atmosphere, which is the tropical western Pacific. It should also be pointed out that a local meteoric water line can have a different slope and intercept from the GMWL, due to differences in humidity and evaporation intensity at different places. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water thus serve as an excellent tracer of the hydrological cycle both globally and locally.|$|E

40|$|The Eocene hyperthermals, {{including}} the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) and Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM 2), represent extreme global warming events ~ 56 and 54 {{million years ago}} associated with rapid increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. An initial study on PETM characteristics in the Arctic region argued for intensification of the hydrological cycle and {{a substantial increase in}} poleward moisture transport during global warming based on compound-specific carbon and hydrogen isotopic (2 H/ 1 H) records from sedimentary leaf-wax lipids. In this study, we apply this isotopic and hydrological approach on sediments deposited during ETM 2 from the Lomonosov Ridge (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 302). Our results show similar 2 H/ 1 H changes during ETM 2 as during the PETM, with a period of 2 H-enrichment (~ 20 ‰) relative to "pre-event" values just prior to the negative carbon isotope shift (CIE) that is often taken as the onset of the hyperthermal, and more negative lipid δ 2 H values (~ - 15 ‰) during peak warming. Notably, lipid 2 H-enrichment {{at the base of the}} event is coeval with colder TEX 86 H temperatures. If 2 H/ 1 H values of leaf waxes primarily reflect the hydrogen isotopic composition of precipitation, the observed local relationship between temperature and 2 H/ 1 H values for the body of ETM 2 is precisely the opposite of what would be predicted using a simple <b>Rayleigh</b> isotope <b>distillation</b> model, assuming a meridional vapor trajectory and a reduction in equator-pole temperature gradients. Overall, a negative correlation exists between the average chain length of n-alkanes and 2 H/ 1 H suggesting that local changes in ecology could have impacted the hydrogen isotopic compositions of leaf waxes. The negative correlation falls across three separate intervals - the base of the event, the initial CIE, and during the H 2 hyperthermal (of which the assignment is not fully certain). Three possible mechanisms potentially explain 2 H-enriched signals at the base of the event, including (1) intense local drying and cooling leading to evaporative 2 H-enrichment; (2) changes in frequency/intensity of storm events and its impact on high latitude amount effects; and (3) changes in low-latitude temperatures. Evidence for hydrological shifts at the base of both hyperthermals suggests that hydrological change or the factors promoting hydrological change played a role in triggering the release of greenhouse gases. Generation of similar high-resolution isotopic- and temperature records at other latitudes is crucial for understanding the causal links between temperature and hydrological changes and may help constrain the source and mechanism of carbon release that triggered the early Eocene hyperthermals. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|The stable silicon isotopic {{composition}} d 30 Si of silicic acid and of biogenic opal {{is used as}} a proxy for investigating the marine silicon cycle and silicic acid utilization by diatoms both at present and in the geological past. The marine biogeochemical and physical processes involved in determining the modern d 30 Si distribution have not been fully understood. Hence, the usage of d 30 Si as a proxy for reconstruction of the marine silicon cycle and paleoproductivity by diatoms is hampered. This work is aimed at providing a comprehensive view and systematic approaches for understanding the oceanic d 30 Si distribution and its controlling mechanisms under both present and the last glacial maximum (LGM) climate conditions. A coupled ocean (MPI-OM) -biogeochemical (HAMOCC 5. 1) model is applied to simulate the marine silicon cycle and the silicon isotopic fractionation processes during biogenic opal production and dissolution. In the present-day simulation, the surface d 30 Si increases along a <b>Rayleigh</b> type <b>distillation</b> curve during the utilization of silicic acid by diatoms, which demonstrates the primary control of biological fractionation on the surface d 30 Si distribution. The variations between the Rayleigh curves in different ocean basins, on the other hand, show the impact of physical transport of water on determination of the surface d 30 Si. In the deep ocean, our model captures a significant silicon isotopic gradient between the North Atlantic and the North Pacific. The advection related to the thermohaline circulation is thought to be the essential controlling factor of deep ocean d 30 Si. The model-data comparison implies that the usage of fractionation during biogenic opal dissolution as explanation to d 30 Si distribution is still speculative. The modeled silicic acid concentrations and d 30 Si show good agreement with the observations, when only fractionation during opal production is considered. The capability of the model to reproduce the large-scale modern oceanic d 30 Si distribution gives us confidence in simulating the d 30 Si during the LGM. In the LGM simulation, the extension of sea-ice cover in both the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere may cause a reduction of phytoplankton growth due to low light under the ice. The silicic acid utilization by diatoms especially around Antarctica is therefore inhibited, in line with reduced biogenic opal export fluxes. Our preliminary model results of the glacial Si {{isotopic composition}} agree with the interpretation from sediment core data that silicic acid utilization by diatoms in the Southern Ocean during the LGM was diminished relative to the present interglacial. The sensitivity of d 30 Si to glacial-interglacial ocean physical variations such as the strength of overturning circulation and ocean surface mixing is tested, using a simple seven-box model. The results indicate that the changes in global average d 30 Si due to the glacial-interglacial ocean physical variation may be of a similar magnitude as the total glacial-interglacial d 30 Si variation. The modeling approach is a valid and powerful tool of promoting a mechanistic understanding of the marine biogeochemical proxy d 30 Si. One important advantage over common interpretation of local field studies is that models calculate isotopic fractionation without application of Rayleigh or open system approximation. In addition, the sensitivity of d 30 Si to various biogeochemical and physical factors can be tested systematically...|$|R

The {{performance of the}} regional model, with a resolution of 0. 5 ° (∼ 55 km), is compared to simulations by the global circulation model ECHAM iso at two coarser resolutions and evaluated against observations of precipitation and δ 18 O.

This paper explores further insights of δ 18 O as a climate proxy, based on REMO iso ’s improvements as compared to ECHAM iso. In particular, the authors focus on the seasonal variation of the amount effect (δ 18 O decrease with precipitation amounts) and the anomalous δ 18 O continental gradient across the Amazon basin, as inferred from the REMO iso, ECHAM iso, and GNIP datasets.

Depth profiles of 13 C from uncultivated control soils show a strong relationship between the natural logarithm of soil organic carbon concentration and its isotopic composition, consistent with a model <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>distillation</b> of 13 C in decomposing soil due to kinetic fractionation during decomposition. Laboratory incubations showed that initially respired CO 2 had a relatively constant 13 C content, despite large differences in the 13 C content of bulk soil organic matter.

The validation of this reconstruction relies on an accurate understanding of the 18 Op and the associated regional climate change {{in response to the}} uplift of the western North America. Here we study this response using a global climate model (GCM) with explicit 18 Op diagnostics (ECHAM 5 -wiso) focusing on the isotopic effects of different types of precipitation, vapor mixing, recycling and moisture source and compare the response against estimates made using a <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>distillation</b> models of moist adiabatic condensation (RDM). Four experiments are performed with Eocene topography inferred from terrestrial stable isotope paleoaltimetry records to investigate how southward propagation of topography affects regional climate (temperature, precipita-tion and circulation pattern) and 18 Op over North America. Our experiments predict 18 Op patterns that are broadly consistent with maps of temporally binned prox...|$|E
40|$|Geochemical {{records of}} {{biogenic}} carbonates provide {{some of the}} most valuable records of the geological past, but are often difficult to interpret without a mechanistic understanding of growth processes. In this experimental study, Halimeda algae are used as a test organism to untangle some of the specific factors that influence their skeletal composition, in particular their Ca-isotope composition. Algae were stimulated to precipitate both calcite and aragonite by growth in artificial Cretaceous seawater, resulting in experimental samples with somewhat malformed skeletons. The Ca-isotope fractionation of the algal calcite (− 0. 6 ‰) appears to be much smaller than that for the algal aragonite (− 1. 4 ‰), similar to the behaviour observed in inorganic precipitates. However, the carbonate from Halimeda has higher Ca-isotope ratios than inorganic forms by approximately 0. 25 ‰, likely because of <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>distillation</b> within the algal intercellular space. In identifying specific vital effects and the magnitude of their influence on Ca-isotope ratios, this study suggests that mineralogy has a first-order control on the marine Ca-isotope cycle...|$|E
40|$|Fe, Ni, and Cr abundances in Type I cosmic spherules {{recovered}} from the deep sea, and also the isotopic fractionation of these elements during passage of the spherules through the terrestrial atmosphere was determined. Isotopic fractionation for all three elements is typically large, approx. 16 %o/amu, corresponding to evaporative mass losses of approx. 80 - 85 %, assuming <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>distillation</b> from an open system. The corrected, pre-atmospheric, Cr/Ni and Fe/Ni ratios are shown, where they are compared to these ratios in bulk chondrites and chondritic metal. Although the calculated pre-atmospheric Fe/Ni ratio for the spherules is relatively constant at 19 plus or minus 4 (sigma (sub mean)), the calculated pre-atmospheric Cr/Ni ratios vary by about two orders of magnitude. The Cr/Ni ratios are thus powerful discriminators for possible modes of origin of the spherules. For example, iron meteorites typically have low Cr contents and low Cr/Ni ratios, {{less than or equal}} to 3 x 10 (exp - 4). Thus, Type I spherules do not appear to be ablation products of iron meteorites, in contrast to an earlier suggestion. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} {{the results of}} the {{analysis}} of two high-resolution time-series of water vapour 18 O/ 16 O ratio (δv) in surface air observed in Connecticut, USA. On an annual time-scale, δv is a linear function of ln w, where w is water vapour mixing ratio, and is approximated by a <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>distillation</b> model with partial (80 %) rainout. On time scales a few days, δv shows considerable variations, often exceeding 20 per mil, and is higher in the wetting phase than in the drying phase of a weather cycle. In precipitation events, the vapour in the surface layer is in general brought to state of equilibrium with falling raindrops but not with snowflakes. On a diurnal time-scale, a peak-to-peak variation of 1 – 2 per mil is observed at a coastal site. At an interior site, evidence of a diurnal pattern is present only on days of low humidity. Our results suggest that the intercept parameter of the Keeling plot is an ambiguous quantity and should not be interpreted as being equivalent to the isotopic signature of evapotranspiration. 1...|$|E

40|$|The H 2 18 O {{stable isotope}} was {{previously}} {{introduced in the}} three coupled components of the Earth System Model i LOVECLIM: atmosphere, ocean and vegetation. The results of a long (5000 yr) pre-industrial equilibrium simulation are presented and evaluated against measurement of H 2 18 O abundance in present-day water for the atmospheric and oceanic components. For the atmosphere, {{it is found that}} the model reproduces the observed spatial distribution and relationships to climate variables with some merit, though limitations following our approach are highlighted. Indeed, we obtain the main gradients with a robust representation of the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>distillation</b> but caveats appear in Antarctica and around the Mediterranean region due to model limitation. For the oceanic component, the agreement between the modelled and observed distribution of water δ 18 O is found to be very good. Mean ocean surface latitudinal gradients are faithfully reproduced as well as the mark of the main intermediate and deep water masses. This opens large prospects for the applications in paleoclimatic context...|$|E
40|$|Sulfur isotope {{studies of}} base metal sulfide {{deposits}} have mostly focussed on sulfide minerals, but elemental sulfur and organic sulfur are also potentially significant components of the sulfur cycle during ore deposition. The δ 34 S of elemental sulfur and organic sulfur isolated from the Paleoproterozoic Here's Your Chance (HYC) Pb/Zn/Ag deposit (McArthur Basin, northern Australia) were measured to be between + 5 and + 8 ‰, approximately 6 to 7 ‰ heavier than the median values of first-generation HYC sulfides. Elemental sulfur and organic sulfur {{are thought to have}} been formed contemporaneously with the first generation of metal sulfides. The δ 34 S of organic sulfur showed an increasing trend along the path of the mineralising fluid, as sulfate was progressively 34 S-enriched due to <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>distillation.</b> The δ 34 S data support a model in which bacterial sulfate reduction produced dissolved sulfide with δ 34 S of 0 to + 5 ‰. The subsequent oxidation of sulfide produced reactive sulfur species such as polysulfide ions, which were then incorporated into organic matter...|$|E
