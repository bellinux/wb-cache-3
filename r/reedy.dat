5|$|The Baylor Bears {{football}} {{program is a}} college football team that represents Baylor University in the Big 12 Conference in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The team has had 25head coaches since it started playing organized football in 1899. Baylor was a charter member of the Southwest Conference (SWC), joining in 1915. They later became a charter member of the Big 12 in 1996 when the SWC disbanded. After playing without a nickname for 15years, the school chose Bears as the team nickname in 1914. There were three seasons where Baylor did not field a team. In 1906, the university banned football due to the violent nature of the sport. However, student protests persuaded school officials to reinstate it the next year. In 1943 and 1944, the school cancelled the {{football program}} due to World War II. The Bears have played in 1,099games during their 108seasons. In those seasons, sevencoaches have led Baylor to postseason bowl games: Bob Woodruff, George Sauer, Sam Boyd, John D. Bridgers, Grant Teaff, Chuck <b>Reedy,</b> and Art Briles. Fivecoaches have won conference championships with the Bears: Charles P. Mosley, Frank Bridges, Teaff, <b>Reedy</b> and Briles.|$|E

Several species of penguin also nest along the coast, notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin (hoiho), as do other seabirds including mollymawks and Australasian gannets, and the estuaries of the rivers {{are home to}} herons, stilts, godwits and oystercatchers.

5|$|DE 9 was {{extended}} north to US 13 Alt. (now US 13) in Wilmington by 1959, being rerouted off Smyrna-Leipsic Road to follow its current alignment to New Castle, passing through that city on 6th Street before continuing along its current alignment to Wilmington. At this point, the entire route was paved. The current <b>Reedy</b> Point Bridge carrying DE 9 over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal {{was completed in}} 1968. By 1971, DE 9 {{was extended}} north to its current terminus at DE 2. DE 9 was realigned to bypass New Castle by 1984 by following Washington Street and DE 273. The intersection at the southern terminus with DE 1 was rebuilt into an interchange in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in helium is nearly three times the {{speed of sound}} in air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to {{the speed of sound}} in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a <b>reedy,</b> duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E
5|$|Upon leaving Port Penn, DE 9 heads through {{marshland}} {{with some}} fields and woods within the Augustine Wildlife Area. The route rises onto the <b>Reedy</b> Point Bridge, which carries {{it over the}} Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. After crossing over the canal, the road crosses over Fort DuPont State Park, curving northwest and passing to the southwest of Fort DuPont and the Governor Bacon Health Center. DE 9 continues into Delaware City and becomes 5th Street, crossing the Delaware City Channel on a drawbridge. Past the drawbridge, the road heads through residential {{areas of the city}} and intersects Clinton Street, which leads northeast to the Forts Ferry Crossing which provides access to Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island, part of Fort Delaware State Park.|$|E

5|$|H-58 {{follows a}} gravel roadway through the forested northwestern corner of Luce County. The roadway turns northeasterly and runs closer to Lake Superior as it {{approaches}} Deer Park. The road also carries the County Road407 (CR407) designation {{and the name}} Grand Marais Truck Trail. Near the Blind Sucker Flooding, a man-made reservoir, the truck trail turns south to intersect Deer Park Road. H-58 turns east on Deer Park Road and runs between Rainy and <b>Reedy</b> lakes {{to the south and}} Lake Superior to the north. The east end of H-58 is at an intersection with H-37 near Muskallonge Lake State Park in Deer Park, north of Newberry. Deer Park is the location of a trio of resorts and remnants of a community that once included a sawmill, hotel and store. The state park is located on the shore of Muskallonge Lake and is visited by about 71,000people each year.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Reedy</b> Creek Improvement District (RCID), {{established}} in 1967, operates six-lane freeways in the Walt Disney World area near Orlando, Florida.

25|$|Like other Governors, Truitt was {{concerned}} about issues like slavery, penal reform, and public education. A new issue arose during his term, however. Due to increasing tensions with Great Britain, the U.S. government had directed Delaware to create and equip a militia of 1300 men. The General Assembly, in turn requested Federal fortification of Wilmington, New Castle, Port Penn, <b>Reedy</b> Island, and Lewes.|$|E
25|$|On February 2, 1967, Roy O. Disney held a {{press conference}} at the Park Theatres in Winter Park, Florida. The role of EPCOT was {{emphasized}} in the film that was played. After the film, it was explained that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the <b>Reedy</b> Creek Improvement District with two cities inside it, Bay Lake and <b>Reedy</b> Creek, now Lake Buena Vista. In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include the issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be property taxes and elevator inspections. The legislation forming the district and the two cities was signed into law by Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967. The Supreme Court of Florida then ruled in 1968 that the district was allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds for public projects within the district, despite the sole beneficiary being Walt Disney Productions.|$|E
