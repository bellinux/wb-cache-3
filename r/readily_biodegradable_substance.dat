30|$|It {{might be}} that the shift of one methyl group to the next {{adjacent}} carbon atom makes 5 -TTri, in contrast to 4 -TTri, a <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> <b>substance.</b> This effect fits the reported behavior in WWTP [9, 27]. Why {{the position of the}} methyl group has such a dramatic influence on biodegradation is still unknown and topic to further research. Steric hindrance of the enzyme(s) catalyzing degradation of 4 -TTri might play a role. Enzymes are known for discriminating substrates due to different substitution patterns [31 – 34]. As 4 - and 5 -TTri are constitutional isomers, {{it seems likely that the}} position of the methyl group effects enzymatic biodegradability.|$|E
40|$|The ready {{biodegradability}} of four chelating agents, N,N -(S,S) -bis[1 -carboxy- 2 -(imidazol- 4 -yl) ethyl]ethylenediamine (BCIEE), N - ethylenedi-L-cysteine (EC), N,N -bis (4 -imidazolymethyl) ethylenediamine (EMI) and 2, 6 -pyridine dicarboxylic acid (PDA), was tested {{according to the}} OECD guideline for testing of chemicals. PDA {{proved to be a}} <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> <b>substance.</b> However, none of the other three compounds were degraded during the 28 days of the test. Chemical simulations were performed for the four compounds in order to understand their ability to complex with some metal ions (Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) and discuss possible applications of these chelating agents. Two different conditions were simulated: (i) {{in the presence of the}} chelating agent and one metal ion, and (ii) in the simultaneous presence of the chelating agent and all metal ions with an excess of Ca. For those compounds that were revealed not to be readily biodegradable (BCIEE, EC and EMI), applications were evaluated where this property was not fundamental or even not required. Chemical simulations pointed out that possible applications for these chelating agents are: food fortification, food process, fertilizers, biocides, soil remediation and treatment of metal poisoning. Additionally, chemical simulations also predicted that PDA is an efficient chelating agent for Ca incrustations removal, detergents and for pulp metal ions removal process...|$|E
30|$|Since {{the purpose}} of the {{biological}} treatment is the reduction of <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> <b>substances</b> and DOC concentration, no process monitoring was performed. The weighted mean of the COD was 222 mg L- 1. The mean dried matter content of 2.1 g L- 1, the reactor volume of 107 L, and a load of 315 L raw waste water in 10 days resulted in a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) load of 16 mg BOD 5 (g TS)- 1 day- 1 (assuming a COD/BOD 5 ratio of 2 : 1). The membrane flux was approximately 21 L (h bar m 2)- 1. The detention period of theoretically 80 h was much higher than the typical 8 h of a municipal waste water treatment plant.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a new urban {{wastewater}} treatment plant scheme for the sustainable agricultural wastewater reuse. The reclamation is obtained modifying an activated sludge process. In the proposed system, the influent is split into several separate streams which are then sent to the various treatment units to perform a partial, selective and modular removal of agronomically useful substances. Numerical simulations have been carried out by implementing the ASM 1 model (by IWA). The model has been verified by the IWA and COST BSM 1. The developed model allows us to run simulations for two distinct periods: the non-irrigated and the irrigated periods. The simulation results show that the effluent concentrations of the various substances are highly variable depending on the plant configuration. The new simplified process will allow the removal of <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> <b>substances</b> harmful to the environment, while releasing the slowly biodegradable nutrients, which are useful for soil irrigation. The advantage is that, with the same system, setting up a plant configuration rather than another, we can define the quality level of the sewage outflows that may be more suitable for irrigation or for protection of receiving water...|$|R

30|$|Whereas the {{toxicity}} of dispersions {{can only be}} expressed {{on the basis of}} nominal concentrations, {{the toxicity}} of filtrates can be expressed in terms of either nominal or analytical concentrations. Therefore, the toxicity results for the small TiO 2 particles varied from no toxicity at all, to EC 20 values of several mg/L (dispersions or filtrates expressed as nominal concentrations) to EC 20 values of several µg/L (filtrates expressed as analytical concentrations). Effect concentrations are used to trigger hazard statements, and according to Directive 67 / 548 /EEC, not <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> <b>substances</b> with a low solubility in water (≤ 1  mg/L) and a log Kow ≤  3 are classified as harmful for the aquatic environment if the ErC/LC 50 is between 10 and 100  mg/L. If the ErC/LC 50 is below 1  mg/L they are classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. Therefore, the conclusions drawn with respect to the toxicity of nanomaterials and the resulting consequences will differ depending on whether total concentrations from dispersion testing or concentrations in filtrates are used to calculate toxicity indicators. Because information on the toxic fraction of dispersed nanomaterials is still limited, nominal concentrations currently appear to be more suitable for effect characterization. This may be revised, and recalculation of the toxicity may be possible, when more information about the toxic fractions of nanomaterials becomes available. We recommend that short-term dispersion procedures are used to characterize the aquatic ecotoxicity of nanomaterials, since long-term stirring appears unsuitable and inappropriate for this purpose.|$|R

40|$|Phenol is a {{pollutant}} {{found in}} many industrial wastewaters, which diminishes biogas formation in anaerobic digesters. In this study, a two-stage (acidogenic and methanogenic) anaerobic digester (TSAD) was compared to a single stage digester (SSD), in treating a synthetic wastewater contaminated with phenol. Both systems were operated in batch-dilution and semi-continuously at 35 °C, and were loaded with a synthetic wastewater containing a constant concentration of <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> organic matter and an increasing concentration of phenol. The TSAD had greater biogas production, and its acidogenic reactor fermented the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> matter without inhibition by accumulation of phenol (up to 1 450 mg∙ℓ- 1).

40|$|Includes bibliography. This {{investigation}} {{was concerned with}} two problems: (1) verification of the bisubstrate concept proposed by Dold, Ekama and Marais (1980), in which the biodegradable component of wastewater consists of <b>readily</b> and slowly <b>biodegradable</b> fractions, and (2) physical separation techniques for estimating the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> fraction. Intensive research, since 1970, into the behaviour of activated sludge systems at the University of Cape Town has culminated {{in the formulation of}} a general kinetic model, by Dold and Marais (1986). The model is highly complex, incorporating a number of different processes; however extensive simulation {{studies have shown that the}} model simulates the behaviour of activated sludge systems very closely. A crucial concept incorporated in the general model is that the biodegradable fraction of a wastewater can be subdivided into two fractions with sharply different characteristics (bisubstrate concept), a <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> fraction which is directly utilized by the organism mass at a high rate and a slowly biodegradable fraction which requires to be solubilized extracellularly to <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> material for subsequent use by [...] the organism. Solubilization is hypothesized to be a relatively slow process. These characteristics were inferred from the oxygen utilization rate response of a system fed in a cyclic square wave fashion. No work has been done to verify if substrates of specific chemical structures can be allocated to one or the other of the fractions. One of the objectives of this {{investigation was}} to check if pure and mixtures of specific selected substrates reflected these fractions when fed to activated sludge systems. Glucose and maize starch were selected as representative of <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> and slowly biodegradable substrate respectively. Systems were run under steady state and square wave cyclic state with glucose only, starch only and glucose/starch mixtures. From the steady state response the specific yield values could be determined and the reliability of the data checked by doing mass balances on the COD. From the cyclic response the specific rate constants for growth and solubilization respectively could be determined by trial simulation using the general model and specifying the concentrations of <b>readily</b> and slowly <b>biodegradable</b> fractions equal to the stoichiometric concentrations of glucose and starch in the feed. The constants thus determined were compared with the "standard" constants for municipal wastewaters...|$|R

To model the biodegradation in the filters, the model developed by Rauch et at. (1999) was used.

This model was extended with equations for the production and the pH-dependent liquid-phase equilibrium for inorganic carbon (IC).

40|$|Three {{continuously}} {{stirred tank}} reactors (CSTR) were operated in semi continuous mode treating swine waste using anaerobic digestion. The reactors {{were used to}} test the effect of solid retention time (SRT) on CH 4 yield, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentrations, % volatile solids (VS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and volatile fatty acids (VFA) removal, <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> COD concentration and the denitrification potential for the effluent in a biological nutrient removal (BNR) system. During Phase I of the study, the three reactors were operated at the same 28 day SRT for 16 weeks. SRTs were then changed during the 12 week Phase II period. The SRTs studied were 14, 21 and 28 days, with the same organic loading rate (OLR) of 1. 88 ± 0. 2 kg VS/ m 3 -day. The reactor with the lowest SRT (14 days) had the highest VS and VFA removal at 73. 6 and 67. 6 % and lowest TAN concentration at 0. 78 g NH 4 +-N/L, followed by the 21 day and 28 day reactors. This was likely due to the fast microbial growth rates and substrate utilization rates in this reactor compared with the other two. The 14 day reactor had the highest CH 4 yield at 0. 33 m 3 CH 4 /kg VS added and <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> COD concentration at 0. 93 COD/L. The variations in CH 4 yield and <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> COD concentrations between the three reactors were not statistically significant. Denitrification potential for the reactors was 1. 20, 0. 73 and 0. 56 g COD/g N for 14, 21 and 28 day reactors, respectively, and the differences were statistically significant. None of the reactors achieved a denitrification potential of 5 g COD/g N, the amount required to use effluent of anaerobically digested swine waste as an internal carbon source in a BNR. This was attributed to operating conditions such as freezing and thawing of the raw swine waste that maximized CH 4 yield and lowered the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> COD concentration.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the performance of a conventional and a modified plug-flow digester for scraped dairy cattle manure based on results from 12 -month studies to characterize the performance of each design with respect to waste stabilization and biogas production and utilization. Both are full-scale digesters located on commercial dairy farms. The primary objective of this comparison was to determine if either design approach provides superior performance with respect to waste stabilization and biogas production. The modified plug-flow digester was found to provide a higher reduction in total volatile solids (TVS), 39. 6 versus 29. 7 percent, a higher biogas yield, 3. 08 versus 2. 21 m 3 per cow-day, and higher electricity production, 13, 896 versus 9, 380 kJ per cow-day. However, these differences were found to be directly related to the difference in the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> fraction of influent TVS, 47 versus 30 percent and were reflected in the rate of electricity generated, 13, 896 kJ per cow-day from the modified versus 9, 380 kJ per cow-day from the conventional plug-flow digester design. In contrast, specific biogas and methane yields on a kg TVS destroyed basis were essentially the same for both digester designs as was the thermal efficiency of converting biogas to electricity. This comparison suggests that neither design is superior. The observed differences in TVS reduction, biogas yield, and electricity generated appear to be solely a reflection of the difference in the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> fraction of influent TVS. This suggests that an estimate of the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> fraction of influent TVS is a necessary prerequisite for a reliable prediction of anaerobic digester performance...|$|R
