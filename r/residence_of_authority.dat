40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the <b>residences</b> <b>of</b> public <b>authority</b> across Europe from the {{emergence}} of the state system to the present. It is concerned with the addresses, the buildings, their surroundings and the symbolic significance {{from the point of view}} of builders and the public. The building styles have been heavily influenced by the examples of imperial and papal Rome, and a dominant model of a European capital city building has evolved. There are also some systematic differences, particularly for those countries with a dramatic history of constitutional change and for those with a decentralized process of state-building in the early stages of the process. In the second half of the 19 th century, and probably again currently, the <b>residences</b> <b>of</b> public <b>authority</b> should be read in conjunction with the positioning of a series of civic institutions. The display <b>of</b> state <b>authority</b> has been increasingly accompanied by the representation of national identity. More recently, however, a touch of cosmopolitanism has been added in many capitals. The reading of these capitals is therefore now more ambiguous. This will probably intensify under the impact of the emerging European multilevel governance system. At the same time, this governance system has become increasingly based in Brussels. For this city to symbolically represent Europe is a very difficult ambition in the context of its multiple capital roles. However, Brussels has a long history of dealing successfully with such urban challenges in spite of major conflicts and drawbacks. ...|$|R

5000|$|All of {{that said}} however, castles were rarely {{forcibly}} invaded. It was considered more honorable, and more appropriate, for a defender's army to sally {{forth from the}} castle to confront his attackers. When this did not happen, sieges were most often performed not {{through the use of}} siege weapons or other methods of forced entry, but by surrounding the enemy castle and simply denying food, water, or other supplies to the fortress. As this tactic could often take months or even years to see results, the besieging army sometimes even built their own castle or fortress nearby. This being the case, [...] "the castle was less a defensive fortress than a symbol of defensive capacity with which to impress or discourage the enemy". It of course also served as the lord's <b>residence,</b> a center <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> and governance, and in various ways a similar function to military barracks.|$|R

50|$|Those two {{previous}} cases {{are only two}} cases in which Dikmen’s presence has been suggested; he has been implicated in many more transactions, but those accusations {{have yet to be}} proven. However, in 1997, former colleagues of Dikmen helped the authorities arrest Dikmen and raid his many apartments. In these apartments, some of which Dikmen rented under false names and used as storage space, the authorities found a surplus of icons, frescoes, early Bibles, ancient pottery, statues, and coins from Cyprus. After learning <b>of</b> another <b>residence</b> <b>of</b> Dikmen’s, the <b>authorities</b> found 30 to 40 more crates filled with icons, frescoes, mosaics, and artifacts. Also in one <b>of</b> the <b>residences,</b> the <b>authorities</b> found drawings containing information on how to cut out mosaics to keep the faces of the religious figures intact, while still taking the piece away from the original space; this shows how systematic and planned out the looting of the churches and monasteries was for Dikmen and his associates {{in the northern part of}} Cyprus. The organization and the intense planning involved brings up the issue of possible aid coming from Turkish authorities in the northern part of Cyprus; there are rumors that the government and military knew about the looting and chose to not do anything about it. This discomforting idea is continually straining the ties between Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus.|$|R
