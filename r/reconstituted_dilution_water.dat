5000|$|This {{standard}} method is recognized by U.S. EPA, which is labeled Method 5210B in the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater [...] In {{order to obtain}} BOD5, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in a sample must be measured {{before and after the}} incubation period, and appropriately adjusted by the sample corresponding dilution factor. This analysis is performed using 300 ml incubation bottles in which buffered <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> is dosed with seed microorganisms and stored for 5 days in the dark room at 20 °C to prevent DO production via photosynthesis. In addition to the various dilutions of BOD samples, this procedure requires <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> blanks, glucose glutamic acid (GGA) controls, and seed controls. The <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> blank is used to confirm the quality of the <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> that is used to dilute the other samples. This is necessary because impurities in the <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> may cause significant alterations in the results. The GGA control is a standardized solution to determine the quality of the seed, where its recommended BOD5 concentration is 198 mg/l ± 30.5 mg/l.For measurement of carbonaceous BOD (cBOD), a nitrification inhibitor is added after the <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> has been added to the sample. The inhibitor hinders the oxidation of ammonia nitrogen, which supplies the nitrogenous BOD (nBOD). When performing the BOD5 test, it is conventional practice to measure only cBOD because nitrogenous demand does not reflect the oxygen demand from organic matter. This is because nBOD is generated by the breakdown of proteins, whereas cBOD is produced by the breakdown of organic molecules.|$|R
40|$|<b>Dilution</b> <b>water</b> demand (DWD) {{can cause}} a {{positive}} error when the dilution biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) method is used. <b>Dilution</b> <b>water</b> demand {{may be attributed to}} oxidation of organic impurities in the <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> and nitrification of ammonia added as a nutrient. To minimize the error associated with these sources, the standard BOD method requires that DWD be less than 0. 2 mg/L in 5 days and does not allow correction for DWD when calculating test results. This study derives a set of theoretical equations to analyze the uncorrected errors with and without seeding. The authors concluded that DWD can be completely corrected if seeded <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> is used for the sample dilution. When seeding individual bottles, the uncorrected error approaches 8. 3 to approximately 8. 8 % at a 5 -day depletion of 2 mg/L for a typical secondary effluent. Tests without seeding show an almost 1 % higher uncorrected error than seeded tests. The analysis also suggests that these errors can be effectively reduced to less than 3 % when the 5 -day depletion approaches 6 mg/L, even for 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand concentrations exceeding 1 X 10 (4) mg/L. Further analysis indicates that, if not inhibited, the ammonium added to <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> as a nutrient may contribute additional error due to nitrification...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{toxicity}} of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) was evaluated {{in the marine}} microalga Isochrysis galbana using data of growth inhibition toxicity tests at 96 -h exposure time. Toxicity was examined in standard conditions and {{by means of the}} modification of two variables of the test media: (1) the <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> and (2) the content of nutrients in the test medium.

40|$|The {{present study}} used a system {{identification}} ARMAX modeling approach to analyze how the pulp properties can be predicted {{from the traditional}} input variables such as hydraulic pressures and <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> feed rates at stable production. As a complement internal states from the refining zones are used as inputs in a commercial production line comprising two serially linked Twin refiners. It is shown that neither the hydraulic pressures and <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> feed rates nor the motor loads from primary and secondary refiners are sufficient as inputs to the ARMAX model to describe the dynamics in the pulp properties. Instead, the temperature profile measurements from the refining zones outperform these traditional inputs and capture the major dynamics in the pulp property studied. It is also shown that the process should be controlled {{in a way that}} reduces as much variations inside the refining zones as possible. It is not only necessary to include the maximum temperatures in the refining zones as internal states when estimating pulp properties but also the periphery temperature since temperature profiles are affected differently depending on whether the changes are made in the hydraulic pressure, production or the <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> feed rates. From a control perspective, refining zone temperature control is preferable to any concepts based on specific energy for minimization of pulp quality variations...|$|R

40|$|The Liffey Estuary and Dublin Bay, Ireland {{are of a}} great {{recreational}} and conservational value. Until recently, the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) plant at Poolbeg, Dublin, abstracted <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> from the estuary for cooling purposes and subsequently discharged this water back to the estuary at temperatures that were sometimes 7 - 9 oC above ambient values.

40|$|Hypoxic blackwater events {{occur when}} {{large amounts of}} organic {{material}} are leached into a water body (e. g., during floodplain inundation) and rapid metabolism of this carbon depletes oxygen from the water column, often with catastrophic effects on the aquatic environment. River regulation may have increased the frequency and severity of hypoxic blackwater events in lowland river systems, necessitating management intervention to mitigate the impacts of these events on aquatic biota. We examine {{the effectiveness of a}} range of mitigation interventions that have been used during large-scale hypoxic blackwater events in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia and that may be applicable in other environments at risk from hypoxic blackwater. Strategies for hypoxia mitigation include: delivery of dilution flows; enhancement of physical re-aeration rates by increasing surface turbulence; and diversion of blackwater into shallow off-channel storages. We show that the impact of <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> delivery is determined by relative volumes and water quality and can be predicted using simple models. At the <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> inflow point, localized oxygenated plumes may also act as refuges. Physical re-aeration strategies generally result in only a small increase in dissolved oxygen but may be beneficial for local refuge protection. Dilution and natural re-aeration processes in large, shallow lake systems can be sufficient to compensate for hypoxic inflows and water processed in off-channel lakes may be able to be returned to the river channel as dilution flows. We provide a set of predictive models (as electronic supplementary material) for estimation of the re-aeration potential of intervention activities and a framework to guide the adaptive management of future hypoxic blackwater events.

40|$|The initial {{step in the}} {{remediation}} {{of nuclear}} waste stored at Hanford and the Savannah River Site (SRS) involves the retrieval and transfer of the waste to another tank or to a treatment facility. The retrieved waste can range from a filtered supernatant to a slurry. Nearly all of the recent solid formation problems encountered during waste transfers and subsequent treatment steps have involved decanted or filtered supernatants. Problems with slurry transfers have not yet surfaced, because tank farm operations at Hanford and the SRS have focused primarily on supernatant transfers and treatment. For example, the interim stabilization program at Hanford continues to reduce the level of supernatants and interstitial liquids in its single-shell tanks through saltwell pumping of filtered liquid. In addition, at present, the cross-site transfer lines at Hanford can be used only to transfer liquids. Another reason for fewer problems with slurry transfers involves the additions of large quantities of <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> prior to the transfer. When the waste is transferred, a drop in temperature is expected because most transfer lines are not heated. However, the <b>dilution</b> <b>water</b> reduces or eliminates solid formation caused by this temperature drop. In sharp contrast, decanted or filtered supernatants are near or at saturation for certain compounds. In such cases, tank farm operators must continue to evaporate their liquid waste since available tank space is quite limited. Solid formation can occur when the temperature of saturated solutions drops even slightly. The evaporation step {{can also lead to}} the formation of problematic solids. At the SRS, the evaporation of a relatively dilute waste stream was suspended due to the formation of deposits in the evaporator system. Therefore, small drops in temperature or evaporation can lead to problematic solid formations...|$|R
