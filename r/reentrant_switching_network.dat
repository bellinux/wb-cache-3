40|$|L (Logarithmic space) versus NL (Non-deterministic {{logarithmic}} space) {{is one of}} {{the great}} open problems in computational complexity theory. In the paper "Bounds on monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity", we separated monotone analogues of L and NL using a model called the <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> model. In particular, by considering inputs consisting of just a path and isolated vertices, we proved that any monotone <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> solving directed connectivity on N vertices must have size at least N^Ω((N)) and this bound is tight. If we could show a similar result for general <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> solving directed connectivity, then this would prove that L ≠ NL. However, proving lower bounds for general <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> solving directed connectivity requires proving stronger lower bounds on monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity. To work towards this goal, we investigated a different set of inputs which we believed to be hard for monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> to solve and attempted to prove similar lower size bounds. Instead, we found that this set of inputs is actually easy for monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity to solve, yet if we restrict ourselves to certain-knowledge <b>switching</b> <b>networks,</b> which are a simple and intuitive subclass of monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity, then these inputs are indeed hard to solve. In this paper, we give this set of inputs, demonstrate a "weird" polynomially-sized monotone <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> for directed connectivity which solves this set of inputs, and prove that no polynomially-sized certain-knowledge <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> can solve this set of inputs, thus proving that monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity are strictly more powerful than certain-knowledge <b>switching</b> <b>networks.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

An enhanced self-routing <b>switch</b> <b>network</b> {{with only one}} barrel shifter permutation structure and a shifter-based two-way duplicated <b>switch</b> <b>network</b> are proposed to support 19 and 3 different submatrices defined in IEEE 802. 16 e and IEEE 802. 11 n. These proposed <b>switch</b> <b>networks</b> can route the decoding message in parallel by different sizes without signal congestion. The enhanced self-routing <b>switch</b> <b>network</b> can <b>switch</b> the messages at different expansion factors with the lowest hardware complexity. Under the condition of a smaller expansion factor, the decoder throughput can be enhanced from the two-way duplicated <b>switch</b> <b>network</b> by increasing the parallelism.

Based on different target applications: we categorize WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> into two connection models: the wavelength-based model and the fiberlink-based model. Most of existing WDM optical switching networksbelongtothefirst category. In this paper we present new designs for WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> under both models by using sparse crossbar switches instead of full crossbar switches in combination with wavelength converters.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade or so, many {{bandwidth}} intensive applications have evolved and the demand for telecommunications as well as computational power has increased dramatically. Consequently, optical communication, and in particular Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology, has become a versatile transmission medium for many applications. ^ The introduction of WDM technology has resulted in increasing the dimensionality of switching by addition of the wavelength switching domain. A main challenge in designing WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> is to provide a nonblocking space wavelength switching capability with optimum hardware and switching complexity. In this dissertation, we address this challenge, and accordingly investigate the problem of designing nonblocking WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> with reduced hardware complexity. ^ We propagate a new design philosophy that exploits the unique capability of optical technologies to reduce switching complexity and enhance scalability, and show that such a design philosophy enables novel classes of WDM <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> with many interesting and useful features. ^ We introduce a novel concept of Wavelength-Exchanging WDM <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> that are capable of switching signals simultaneously and seamlessly both in space and wavelength domains. This concept leads to <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> that have the following advantages: (1) reduced size and complexity, (2) a shorter signal path, (3) strict wavelength conversion between two predefined and fixed wavelengths, and (4) transparency to routing algorithms. ^ We introduce a new design approach for multicast WDM <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> based on concentrators and multi-wavelength converters (MWCs) technologies to enhance the design flexibility of nonblocking multicast <b>switching</b> <b>networks.</b> For example, we show {{that it is possible to}} design a nonblocking WDM <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> with full-multicast capability without using 2 ̆ 2 any 2 ̆ 2 power splitters. ...|$|R

The models are used to analyse adaptive routing and flow control in fully connected circuit switched and sparsely connected packet <b>switched</b> <b>networks.</b> In particular the performance of routing algorithms derived from the L(_R-I) linear learning automata model are assessed for both types of network. A novel architecture using the INMOS Transputer is constructed for simulation of both circuit and packet <b>switched</b> <b>networks</b> in a loosely coupled multi- microprocessor environment. The network topology is mapped onto an identically configured array of processing centres to overcome the processing bottleneck of conventional Von Neumann architecture machines.
