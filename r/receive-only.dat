5|$|The {{hardware}} for {{the original}} combat system was based around the Motorola 68000 family of processors. The replacement combat system consists of the tactical and fire control components from the Raytheon CCS Mk2 system, combined with the sonar interfaces developed for the improved combat system used aboard Sheean and Dechaineux. Countermeasures include a Condor CS-5600 ESM intercept and warning unit, and two SSE decoys. The boats are fitted with a Marconi SDG-1802 degaussing system, and a <b>receive-only</b> Link 11 combat information exchange datalink. In October 2006, Sagem Défense Sécurité was selected to fit the Collins class with SIGMA 40XP gyrolaser inertial navigation systems.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its life, the platform's {{software}} {{has been}} upgraded {{several times and}} although these upgrades were due to be stopped as part of plans to retire the A-10 in February 2014, Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James ordered that the latest upgrade, designated Suite 8, continue in response to Congressional pressure. Suite 8 software includes IFF Mode 5, which modernizes the ability to identify the A-10 to friendly units. Additionally, the Pave Penny pods and pylons are being removed as their <b>receive-only</b> capability {{has been replaced by}} the AN/AAQ-28(V)4 LITENING AT targeting pods or Sniper XR targeting pod, which both have laser designators and laser rangefinders.|$|E

25|$|The SPI bus is a {{de facto}} {{standard}}. However, {{the lack of a}} formal standard is reflected {{in a wide variety of}} protocol options. Different word sizes are common. Every device defines its own protocol, including whether it supports commands at all. Some devices are transmit-only; others are <b>receive-only.</b> Chip selects are sometimes active-high rather than active-low. Some protocols send the least significant bit first.|$|E
25|$|Channel spacing for voice {{communication}} on the airband was originally 200kHz until 1947, providing 70 channels from 118 to 132MHz. Some radios {{of that time}} provided <b>receive-only</b> coverage below 118MHz {{for a total of}} 90 channels. From 1947–1958 the spacing became 100kHz; from 1954 split once again to 50kHz and the upper limit extended to 135.95MHz (360 channels), and then to 25kHz in 1972 to provide 720 usable channels. On 1 January 1990 the frequencies between 136.000 and 136.975MHz were added, resulting in 760 channels.|$|E
25|$|The {{television}} programmes {{prepared by}} the Indian government at the four studios were transmitted at 6GHz to ATS 6 from one of two ground stations located in Delhi and Ahmedabad. These signals were then re-transmitted at 860MHz by the satellite, which were directly received in 2000 villages by community television receivers with 3m parabolic antennas. Regular television stations also received the signals and broadcast them to another 3000 villages in the standard VHF television band. Each television signal had two audio channels to carry audio in two major languages of each cluster. This setup was called the Direct Reception System (DRS). Apart from the direct broadcasts, the earth station at Ahmedabad was micro-wave linked to the TV transmitter built {{in the village of}} Pij. The Delhi studio was linked to the terrestrial TV transmitters of AIR. A <b>receive-only</b> station was built in Amritsar and linked to the local TV transmitter.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} method of {{reception}} is direct-broadcast satellite television (DBSTV), {{also known as}} [...] "direct to home" [...] (DTH). In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a direct broadcast satellite on the Ku wavelength and are completely digital. Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as television <b>receive-only.</b> These systems received analog signals transmitted in the C-band spectrum from FSS type satellites, and required the use of large dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed [...] "big dish" [...] systems, and were more expensive and less popular.|$|E
2500|$|HBO became {{involved}} in several lawsuits during the 1980s, involving legal statutes imposed by state and city laws that {{would have resulted in}} some programs on HBO and other pay television networks being censored by cable systems, if not forcing the pay services to edit inappropriate content from the programming they aired. In January 1986, HBO became the first satellite-delivered television network to encrypt its signal from unauthorized viewing by way of the Videocipher II system; this initially resulted in a mass lodge of complaints from television <b>receive-only</b> (TVRO) satellite users that previously received HBO's programming without a subscription. The objections by TVRO users over having to now pay for HBO as cable subscribers had long done (requiring dish subscribers to purchase an expensive descrambler to unencrypt the signal) came to a head four months later, as HBO became a victim of broadcast signal intrusion when satellite television dealer John R. MacDougall, a Florida man calling himself [...] "Captain Midnight", redirected a receiver dish towards the network's transponder on Galaxy 1 and intercepted its signal during a movie presentation of The Falcon and the Snowman; MacDougall overrode the telecast of the film with a text-based message placed over SMPTE color bars in protest of the channel's decision to scramble its signal for home satellite subscribers. The Federal Communications Commission subsequently prosecuted MacDougall for committing the intrusion.|$|E

5000|$|A reed {{receiver}} or tuned reed receiver (US) {{was a form}} of {{multi-channel signal}} decoder used for early radio control systems.

50|$|Growth of {{grey market}} {{television}} <b>receive-only</b> dishes by 1980 led the Canadian government under {{the administration of}} Pierre Trudeau to allow for pay television in Canada, and {{that there would be}} hearings to licence pay television networks in Canada.

The system also supports units that just {{want to listen to}} a network, called <b>receive-only</b> units, which have the capability to request access to the network, but are not allocated any transmission capacity. In addition, the system also supports units that only want to listen to a network without performing any transmissions at all (silent join units).|$|E
5000|$|The Global Broadcast Service (GBS) is a {{combined}} United States space and Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) system, {{that provides a}} one-way Wideband/high-Throughput of information to forces garrisoned, deployed, or on the move.An advancement in satellite communications, GBS fills the two key Military communications requirements: 1) high data rates to many users at once; and 2) high data rates to very small, low-cost user <b>receive-only</b> terminals. GBS consists of Transmit Sites (TS), Broadcast satellite payloads, and receive suites (RS).|$|E
5000|$|Modern systems {{signals are}} relayed from a {{communications}} satellite on the Ku band frequencies (12-18 GHz) requiring {{only a small}} dish less than a meter in diameter. [...] The first satellite TV systems were an obsolete type now known as television <b>receive-only.</b> These systems received weaker analog signals transmitted in the C-band (4-8 GHz) from FSS type satellites, requiring the use of large 2-3 meter dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed [...] "big dish" [...] systems, and were more expensive and less popular.|$|E

50|$|The DECwriter LA30 was a 30 character/second {{dot matrix}} {{printing}} terminal introduced in 1970 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of Maynard, Massachusetts. It printed 80 columns of uppercase-only 7×5 dot matrix characters across a unique-sized paper. The printhead {{was driven by}} a stepper motor and the paper was advanced by a noisy solenoid ratchet drive. The LA30 was available with both a parallel interface (LA30-P) and a serial interface (LA30-S); however, the serial LA30 required the use of fill characters during the carriage-return. In 1972, a <b>receive-only</b> variation named LA30A became available as well.|$|E
50|$|An antenna {{such as the}} one {{described}} above is usable for both local and medium-long distance communication across a frequency range of about 1:6. For example, an antenna for the lower portion of shortwave (say, 3-18 MHz) will be roughly 33 m (110 feet) long, with conductors spaced 1 m (3.3 feet). For the higher portion of shortwave (5-30 MHz), this antenna will be roughly 20 m (66 feet) long, with a spacing of 60 cm (24 inches). If such long spans cannot be accommodated, smaller antennas will still give adequate <b>receive-only</b> performance down to about half of their lowest design frequency.|$|E
