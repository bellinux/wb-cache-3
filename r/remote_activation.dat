Dark photons with large value of Planck constant coming as integer multiple of ordinary Planck constant propagate along flux quanta connecting biomolecules: this realizes the idea about wave DNA. Biomolecules act as quantum antennas and those with common antenna frequencies interact resonantly.

40|$|In {{pyramidal}} cells, induction {{of long-term}} potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory synaptic transmission by coincidence of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity is considered relevant to learning processes in vivo. Here {{we show that}} temporally correlated spiking activity of a pyramidal cell and an inhibiting interneuron may cause LTD or LTP of unitary IPSPs. Polarity of change in synaptic efficacy depends on timing between Ca 2 � influx induced by a backpropagating train of action potentials (APs) in pyramidal cell dendrites (10 APs, 50 Hz) and subsequent activation of inhibitory synapses. LTD of IPSPs was induced by synaptic activation {{in the vicinity of}} the AP train (� 300 msec relative to the beginning of the train), whereas LTP of IPSPs was initiated with more <b>remote</b> synaptic <b>activation</b> (� 400 msec relative to the beginning of the AP train). Solely AP trains induced neither LTP nor LTD. Both LTP and LTD were prevented by 5 mM BAPTA loaded into pyramidal cells. LTD was prevented by 5 mM EGTA, whereas EGTA failed to affect LTP. Synaptic plasticity was not dependent on activation of GABA B receptors. It was also not affected by the antagonists of vesicular exocytosis, botulinum toxin D, and GDP-�-S.

40|$|A {{composite}} material {{consisting of a}} thermally-sensitive hydrogel and optically active nanoparticles would possess the temperature sensitive characteristics of the NA copolymer {{as well as the}} absorption spectrum of the nanoshells. The combination of these two properties in a single material opens up several very interesting opportunities in a number of applications. Composite hydrogels consisting of either Au-Au 2 S or SiO 2 -Au nanoshells or gold colloid embedded in a N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylamide copolymer collapse upon exposure to light that matches the peak extinction wavelength of the nanoparticles. These {{composite material}}s have successfully delivered a wide range of molecular weight compounds, from methylene blue (MW 345) to bovine serum albumin (MW 66, 000), in a pulsatile fashion in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, insulin that has been released from the composite hydrogels in this manner retains its activity. Due to the ability of the nanoshell-composite to provide on-demand release of a therapeutic agent, such a system may prove to be beneficial in the treatment of diseases that require a flexible therapeutic regimen, such as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. The collapse of the composite hydrogels has also been investigated for use as valves or gates in microfluidic devices. Hydrogels containing different nanoparticles exhibit independent optical addressibility, and were polymerized in situ within existing microfluidic chambers. Composite materials of optically active nanoparticles and thermally sensitive hydrogels should prove useful {{in a wide range of}} applications where <b>remote</b> optical <b>activation</b> of a mechanical device, such as a gate or switch, is desired, in particular where large relative displacements of such a structure are desirable...|$|R
40|$|DNA strand {{displacement}} {{systems have}} proven {{themselves to be}} fertile substrates {{for the design of}} programmable molecular machinery and circuitry. Domain-level reaction enumerators provide the foundations for molecular programming languages by formalizing DNA strand displacement mechanisms and modeling interactions at the "domain" level - one level of abstraction above models that explicitly describe DNA strand sequences. Unfortunately, the most-developed models currently only treat pseudo-linear DNA structures, while many systems being experimentally and theoretically pursued exploit a much broader range of secondary structure configurations. Here, we describe a new domain-level reaction enumerator that can handle arbitrary non-pseudoknotted secondary structures and reaction mechanisms including association and dissociation, 3 -way and 4 -way branch migration, and direct as well as <b>remote</b> toehold <b>activation.</b> To avoid polymerization that is inherent when considering general structures, we employ a time-scale separation technique that holds in the limit of low concentrations. This also allows us to "condense" the detailed reactions by eliminating fast transients, with provable guarantees of correctness for the set of reactions and their kinetics. We hope that the new reaction enumerator will be used in new molecular programming languages, compilers, and tools for analysis and verification that treat a wider variety of mechanisms of interest to experimental and theoretical work. We have implemented this enumerator in Python, and it is included in the DyNAMiC Workbench Integrated Development Environment.

This work, divided in three experimentally interconnected chapters, will highlight {{the importance of this}} approach with the syntheses of taiwaniaquinoid and icetexane natural products. A protecting-group-free route to (−) -taiwaniaquinone F based on a Wolff-rearrangement ring contraction and subsequent aromatic oxidation of a sugiol derivative was deviced following a proposed biogenetic pathway. In addition, the first synthesis of (+) -taiwaniaquinol A is reported via short time exposure of (−) -taiwaniaquinone F to sunlight triggering a remote C−H functionalization. The hypothesis that the biogenesis of several methylenedioxy bridged natural products could proceed via similar nonenzymatic mechanisms is presented. A divergent synthesis of thirteen members of icetexane natural products based on a proposed biogenetic cationic ring expansion of a reduced carnosic acid derivative is described. Among these members, (+) -salvicanol, (−) -cyclocoulterone, (−) -coulterone, (−) -obtusinone D, (−) -obtusinone E, and (−) -euolutchuol E are synthesized for the first time.
