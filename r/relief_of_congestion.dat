40|$|Congestion, due {{in large}} part to hypervolemia, is the primary driver of heart failure (HF) admissions. <b>Relief</b> <b>of</b> <b>congestion</b> has been {{traditionally}} achieved through the use of loop diuretics, but there is increasing concern that these agents, particularly at high doses, may be deleterious in the inpatient setting. In addition, patients with HF and the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) have diminished response to loop diuretics, making these agents less effective at relieving congestion. Ultrafiltration, a mechanical volume removal strategy, has demonstrated promise in achieving safe and effective volume removal in patients with cardiorenal syndrome and diuretic refractoriness. This paper outlines the rationale for ultrafiltration in CRS and the available evidence regarding its use in patients with HF. At present, the utility of ultrafiltration is restricted to selected populations, but a greater understanding of how this technology impacts HF and CRS may expand its use...|$|E

We call this dual robustness property of multiscale networks “ultrarobustness. ” Furthermore, we find that multiscale networks attain most of their robustness with surprisingly few link additions, suggesting that ultrarobust organizational networks can be generated in an efficient and scalable manner.

Monitoring of response to therapy through the assessment of daily weights and net fluid loss is the current standard of care, yet the relationship between commonly used markers of decongestion and both patient reported symptom relief and clinical outcomes are unknown. Methods and Results—We performed a retrospective analysis of the randomized clinical trial-Diuretic Optimization Strategy Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure (DOSE-AHF), enrolling patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Dyspnoea and {{peripheral}} oedema, {{caused by}} fluid redistribution to the lungs and/or by fluid overload, {{are the main}} causes of hospitalization in patients with heart failure and are associated with poor outcomes. Treatment of fluid overload should relieve symptoms and have a neutral or favorable effect on outcomes. AREAS COVERED: We first consider the results obtained with furosemide administration, which is still the mainstay of treatment of congestion in patients with heart failure. We then discuss important shortcomings of furosemide treatment, including the development of resistance and side effects (electrolyte abnormalities, neurohormonal activation, worsening renal function), {{as well as the}} relationship of furosemide - and its doses - with patient prognosis. Finally, the results obtained with potential alternatives to furosemide treatment, including different modalities of loop diuretic administration, combined diuretic therapy, dopamine, inotropic agents, ultrafiltration, natriuretic peptides, vasopressin and adenosine antagonists, are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: <b>Relief</b> <b>of</b> <b>congestion</b> is a major objective of heart failure treatment but therapy remains based on the administration of furosemide, an agent that is often not effective and is associated with poor outcomes. The results of the few controlled studies aimed at the assessment of new treatments to overcome resistance to furosemide and/or to protect the kidney from its untoward effects have been mostly neutral.

40|$|There is {{currently}} a wave of high speed rail proposals sweeping through Europe, amounting to some 7000 route kilometres of new construction and 8000 of upgraded track and costing {{of the order of}} 58 billion ecu (in 1985 prices). There is therefore an urgent need for a careful assessment of the costs and benefits, both of the network as a whole and of the individual component parts of it. The principal benefits of high speed rail are taken to be the revenue, traffic and time savings it generates; <b>relief</b> <b>of</b> <b>congestion,</b> accidents and environmental effects of other modes of transport and its alleged local and regional development benefits. Clearly many of these benefits depend on how far it really does divert traffic from these modes as opposed to generating totally new trips. At the same time, high speed rail schemes have significant environmental costs. Evidence on all of these issues is examined, and it is concluded that the evidence for environmental and development benefits is limited, although in the former case in particular much depends on the exact circumstances. Given the wide variety of options in terms of speeds and mix of upgrading versus new construction, careful appraisal is very important, and a traditional transport cost-benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment appear well equipped to capture the main costs and benefits. The conclusion is that there {{is likely to be a}} good case for a core network linking the major cities of Western Europe in the middle distance range, but beyond that, upgrading of existing infrastructure and development of new technology may provide a more cost-effective solution...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effects of serelaxin on {{short-term}} changes in markers of organ damage and congestion and relate them to 180 -day mortality in patients with acute heart failure. BackgroundHospitalization for acute heart failure is associated with high post-discharge mortality, and this may be related to organ damage. MethodsThe Pre-RELAX-AHF (Relaxin in Acute Heart Failure) phase II study and RELAX-AHF phase III study were international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in which patients hospitalized for acute heart failure were randomized within 16 h to intravenous placebo or serelaxin. Each patient was followed daily to day 5 or discharge and at days 5, 14, and 60 after enrollment. Vital status was assessed through 180 days. In RELAX-AHF, laboratory evaluations were performed daily to day 5 and at day 14. Plasma levels of biomarkers were measured at baseline and days 2, 5, and 14. All-cause mortality was assessed as a safety endpoint in both studies. ResultsSerelaxin reduced 180 -day mortality, with similar effects in the phase II and phase III studies (combined studies: N = 1, 395; hazard ratio: 0. 62; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 43 to 0. 88; p = 0. 0076). In RELAX-AHF, changes in markers of cardiac (high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T), renal (creatinine and cystatin-C), and hepatic (aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase) damage and of decongestion (N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide) at day 2 and worsening heart failure during admission were associated with 180 -day mortality. Serelaxin administration improved these markers, consistent with the prevention of organ damage and faster decongestion. ConclusionsEarly administration of serelaxin was associated with a reduction of 180 -day mortality, and this occurred with fewer signs of organ damage and more rapid <b>relief</b> <b>of</b> <b>congestion</b> during the first days after admission...|$|E

FDEs are common types of drug eruptions amongst all cutaneous drug-induced side effects, mostly by intermittent exposure. Multiple drugs with common chemical structure can cause same type of lesions at same site called as cross sensitivity. There are many causative agents and the incidence of FDEs for a particular drug depends on the frequency of its use. Though usually not severe or fatal, cosmetic embarrassment is main problem, especially when they recur on the previously affected sites leaving behind residual hyperpigmentation. Phenylephrine is a sympathomimetic agent, given orally for the symptomatic <b>relief</b> <b>of</b> nasal <b>congestion.</b> It is also commonly combined with other ingredients in preparations intended for the <b>relief</b> <b>of</b> cough and cold symptoms. Considering the frequent use of Phenylephrine, associated drug eruptions generally appear to be rare, cross sensitivity with pseudoephedrine is even rarer.
