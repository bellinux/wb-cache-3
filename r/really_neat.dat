The episode {{was shot in}} the second half of July 2010. Hunt later tweeted on-set photos in January 2011. At San Diego Comic-Con International during the summer leading up to the season premiere, actress Jasika Nicole told the audience they would finally be able to see her character's apartment, which has previously been only alluded to in an early season two episode. She explained, [...] "It's <b>really</b> <b>neat!</b> [...] There's all these tiny little things that give you insight into how things are.

500|$|For the new songs, Madonna {{worked with}} David Foster, a {{well-known}} producer {{who had worked}} with the likes of Barbra Streisand, Al Jarreau and Earth, Wind & Fire. Foster initially did not expect Madonna would collaborate with him, as he believed that his music would not [...] "really [...] hip enough for her". The recording session with Foster resulted in two new songs to the final track list, [...] "You'll See" [...] and [...] "One More Chance". Foster commented: [...] "At the end of the day, the songs we did were not particularly impressive, though one of them, 'You'll See', was <b>really</b> <b>neat.</b> Madonna had written a great lyric ('You think that I can't live without your love / You'll see') and I thought my music was great". The track was produced and arranged by Madonna and Foster, who worked on the song during the third weekend of September 1995.|$|E
500|$|Producer Glen Morgan was {{disappointed}} with the resolution regarding the Crew Cut Man, saying [...] "My feeling is that to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen. I thought 'Geez, {{this is the guy}} who killed Deep Throat, who the audience loved, and it's kind of tossed away.' The episode just seems like half of one thing for a while, then half of something else. I think that was a curious choice for Chris [...] He wanted to take a real left turn, but I'd rather have seen a whole episode about that guy showing up and Mulder getting back at him." [...] X-Files writer James Wong also had a negative view of the episode, saying [...] "I think {{that was one of the}} most confusing episodes I've ever seen. It had some <b>really</b> <b>neat</b> ideas in it, but I don't think it pulled together finally." ...|$|E

You know the crowd that started coming to this music in '77, it was maybe a peak of their scene, or the scene at that time. They were not normal kinds of clubs, they weren't places like the Stone, or even the Mabuhay, <b>really.</b> They were <b>neat</b> places to play; often good audiences, and good energy going on." ...|$|R
500|$|Madonna's {{recording}} {{session with}} David Foster resulted two new songs {{to the final}} track listing, [...] "You'll See" [...] and [...] "One More Chance". Foster commented: [...] "At {{the end of the}} day, the songs we did were not particularly impressive, though one of them, [...] "You'll See", was <b>really</b> <b>neat.</b> Madonna had written a great lyric (You think that I can't live without your love / You'll see) and I thought my music was great." [...] "You'll See" [...] is a low bass track featuring wind chimes and a Spanish guitar. Throughout the chord changes progression to give Madonna's vocals dominance in the song, and after a minute the percussion starts with a tremolo guitar added later. Lyrically, the song talks of independence after the end of a love affair stating that Madonna will go onto greater things. Madonna was asked whether the track was about revenge to which she replied [...] "No, it's about empowering yourself." [...] Madonna later recorded the Spanish version of [...] "You'll See" [...] in Gloria and Emilio Estefan's studio in Miami. Titled [...] "Verás", the song was adapted into Spanish by Paz Martinez. The next original song, [...] "One More Chance", is an acoustic ballad, whose lyrics are about attempting to win a lost lover back. The song was inspired by Madonna's real life experience, but she wrote it from the opposite point of view. Its composition has an organic arrangement, devoid of any synths and sequencing, and only based on guitars with plenty of chord changes and subdued strings.|$|E

I began to let my hair grow and become a real New York hippie", he recalled.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{performed}} the song {{at the opening}} of the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards as her debut performance on the ceremony. During the performance, the singer ripped open her top to expose a black bra underneath, and became highly controversial in the media for its provocative nature, considered to usher in [...] "a new age of sexual spontaneity." [...] It was viewed as the first [...] "shocking" [...] performance of her career due to Jackson having a virginal teenage image, in addition to the portrayal of female sexuality considered taboo at the time. MTV News explained halfway through her performance, Jackson [...] "Although this was no wardrobe malfunction, it was a nonetheless shocking move." [...] It was ranked among [...] "10 Amazing, Shocking Unscripted Moments From ’90s MTV," [...] saying [...] "Janet Jackson ushered in a new age of sexual spontaneity on live television [...] It seems tame now, but it was just the beginning of the more sexualized image she took on in the ’90s." [...] VH1 also called it a [...] "fiery rendition." [...] Regarding the performance, Jackson explained, [...] "In the concert, I normally open up my blouse, but for the MTV Awards we found this <b>really</b> <b>neat</b> top that had snaps instead of buttons. So when I undid it - the whole thing went!" ...|$|E

But the thing that killed the Tarpon {{was the fact that}} we didn't have a V-8 for it at that time.... Roy Abernethy didn't like little cars. Never did. He liked big cars, because he was a big guy -- hell of a nice guy. And he felt that this car was too small, so he said, [...] "Well, heck, Teague, why don't you just put it on the Rambler Classic wheel-base? That way you've got V-8 availability and you've got more room inside it." [...] And then on top of that he added an inch to the roof while I was in Europe.

Davidson, the first local owner in the team's history, said [...] "When I was first approached with this, I {{saw it as a}} great way to give back to a tennis community that has meant so much to me. My dad Gary was involved with World TeamTennis during its inception in 1973, so coming full circle now and owning the Breakers is <b>really</b> pretty <b>neat.</b> I look forward to putting a championship-caliber product on the court and providing our fans with a first-class environment to watch professional tennis." [...] WTT CEO/Commissioner Ilana Kloss said, [...] "From a league perspective, {{it is very important to}} have strong local ownership with someone who has a passion for tennis and the community.

500|$|Diane Hamer likens Bannon's {{work to the}} Mills and Boon of lesbian literature, {{but unlike}} {{conventional}} romance novels, her stories never <b>really</b> have <b>neat</b> and tidy conclusions. Hamer also takes note of Bannon's use of Freudian symbolism: in I Am a Woman, Jack frequently mentions that he is being psychoanalyzed, and his friends react with interest. Jack labels Laura [...] "Mother" [...] and continues to refer to this nickname instead of her real name throughout the series, as though Bannon—through Jack—is vaguely mocking Freud and the ideas that have framed the construction of sexuality in the 1950s. Scholar Michele Barale remarks that Bannon's literary devices in Beebo Brinker defy {{the expectations of the}} audience for whom the novel was specifically marketed: heterosexual males. Bannon chooses the first character, an [...] "everyman" [...] named—significantly—Jack Mann, with whom the male audience identifies, only to divulge that he is gay and has maternal instincts. His interest turns to Beebo, whom he finds [...] "handsome" [...] and lost, and he takes her home, gets her drunk, and becomes asexually intimate with her. Barale writes that Bannon manipulates male readers to become interested in the story, then turns them into voyeurs and imposes homosexual desires upon them, though eventually places them in a safe position to understand a gay story from a heterosexual point of view.|$|R

500|$|... "The Front" [...] {{was written}} by Adam I. Lapidus and {{directed}} by Rich Moore. In the early 1990s, Lapidus saw a news report on television about three 13-year-old girls - Renee Carter, Sarah Creef, and Amy Crosby - who had written a script for Tiny Toon Adventures, titled [...] "Buster And Babs Go Hawaiian". The show's executive producer, Steven Spielberg, liked the script {{so much that he}} brought the three to Hollywood to work with the show's writing staff. Upon seeing the report, Lapidus thought, [...] "That would <b>really</b> be a <b>neat</b> idea for Bart and Lisa." [...] He wrote a spec script, which made its way via executive producer James L. Brooks to the Simpsons staff, who hired Lapidus to write the episode. [...] "The Front" [...] is the only Simpsons episode written by Lapidus, causing some dispute among the show's fans as to whether he actually exists or was perhaps a pseudonym. Lapidus' mother-in-law came upon one such debate on an Internet forum.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{question}} of what are we trying to achieve in teaching business ethics at undergraduate university level. The dominant normative model of business ethics suggests that the aim of business ethics (including the teaching of business ethics) is to move businesspeople from an egotistic position to an altruistic position. According to the latter position, the greater good of society is served by unselfish, other-regarding action, instead of by the narrow, self-centred interests of individuals or corporations acting on their own behalf (i. e. egoism).

[...] "I think that's a <b>really</b> <b>neat</b> way to tell stories and something that could be utilized in comics more often." [...] Kirkman put together a team of four other writers, beginning with Nick Spencer, to rotate different story arcs.

For another, this episode built directly on recent romantic tribulations in Barry and Kara's lives. I was a bit concerned coming into 'Duet,' as I worried the writers might attempt to use the crossover as an attempt to force in a romantic subplot involving Barry and Kara. As their 'Super Friends' number showed, they're better as friends than lovers." [...] Schedeen added, [...] "Instead, Barry's musical nightmare was a means of repairing the rifts between Barry/Iris and Kara/Mon-El. It turns out Music Meister isn't such a bad dude after all. In the case of Kara and Mon-El, I hope future Supergirl episodes don't simply let the matter of his deception drop, but we'll see. For now, anything less than happy endings all around would have left a sour note on a lovely, upbeat episode." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1977 {{the program}} hired former player Doug Beal {{as a full}} time coach of the U.S. Men’s National Team. He became the driving force for {{establishing}} a full-time, year-around volleyball training center. The facility was created in Dayton, Ohio, in 1978. However, California was the hot bed of volleyball talent at the time, {{and many of the}} nation's top players were not willing to participate on the national team if it meant they had to relocate to Dayton. In 1981 the training center was moved to San Diego, California, along with the national team program. Now a veteran, Sunderland had developed into a solid all-around player. In San Diego he was joined on the national team by a collection of the top collegiate talent from the California area, including Karch Kiraly, Dusty Dvorak, Steve Timmons, Craig Buck, Steven Salmons, Pat Powers and Doug Partie. By 1983 the U.S. squad was among the world's elite teams. The turnaround culminated with the Gold Medal at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Playing at the Olympic games and winning the gold medal were lifetime achievements for Sunderland, earned at the end of many long years of effort.
