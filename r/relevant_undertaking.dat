40|$|To my Wife and Family. This thesis {{emphasizes}} {{the utility of}} applying new media cartography to political issues. To this end news space and Internet colinkage network mapping was undertaken {{in relation to the}} North Korean nuclear crisis over time. The presence of semantic organizing frameworks in news coverage related to the North Korean issue in English, Chinese and Japanese were mapped and analyzed with the aid of software. The thesis presents, through visualization methodology, a statistically significant measurement of how public diplomacy efforts related to North Korea resonate on the Internet. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) development and application is not disassociated from or incidental to the constitution of the body politic in modern society. Therefore, Web-based study of conflict and information politics such as that presented in this thesis is an increasingly <b>relevant</b> <b>undertaking</b> within international relations scholarship.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} dual role - {{exemplified}} by the ideal-types of the consumer and the citizen - individuals' face in contemporary environmental policy. As crowding-out theory highlights the implications of using ‘wrong' incentives or controlling means, examining the match between policy and those value-systems guiding individuals' decision-making process in practice should indeed be a <b>relevant</b> <b>undertaking.</b> Sweden provides the empirical example for the article, in which a text analysis of policy documents is compared {{with the results of}} a mail-out survey to 4000 individuals in four different counties. The article finds that external motivations are perceived as being highly relevant for the promotion of ecological sustainability in Sweden and, thus, that the notion of the consumer-role as guiding individuals' behaviour in the environmental field is rather strong. However, at the same time people tend to ascribe the motivational values included in the Self-transcendence cluster (altruism) a far greater importance as guiding principles in life than the opposing values of Self-enhancement (egoism), indicating that the citizen-role indeed is important to account for in policy-making. Hence, clearly there is a mismatch between Sweden's contemporary policy documents and the general value orientation held by Swedish people in general. Godkänd; 2006; 20080826 (simon_m...|$|E

40|$|Universities in Latin America are {{increasingly}} considered instruments {{of social and}} economic development and face rising expectations in regard to supplying <b>relevant</b> skills, <b>undertaking</b> applied research, and engaging in commercial activity. The paper discusses trends and challenges within Latin American universities, as well as policy options available for strengthening their contributions to social and economic development. The so-called third mission of universities is often equated with knowledge transfer narrowly defined as licensing and commercialization of research. The paper adopts a broader approach and explores how the new role of universities affects all aspects of academic practice in Latin America, including advanced education and research. It concludes that policymakers and university managers in Latin America face an important challenge of defining a legal framework, sound management procedures, and notably, incentive systems that stimulate outreach and entrepreneurship among students and staff while recognizing and preserving the distinct roles of universities.
