Not far off they saw a tuft of trees, which appeared as if {{there might be a}} spring of water beneath them. They went thither to fetch some, leaving Cadmus stretched on the ground along with the brindled cow; for, now that he had found a place of rest, it seemed as if all the weariness of his pilgrimage, ever since he left King Agenor's palace, had fallen upon him at once. But his new friends had not long been gone, when he was suddenly startled by cries, shouts, and screams, and the noise of a terrible struggle, {{and in the midst of}} it all, a most awful hissing, which went right through his ears like a <b>rough</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tule (Schoenoplectus acutus {{also called}} bulrushes) have a thin (~1 cm or 0.5 inch) diameter, rounded green stems that grows to 1 to 3 metres (3-10 ft) tall. They grow well in marshes, {{wetlands}} {{or at the}} edges of bodies of water. The tule stem has a pithy interior filled with spongy tissue packed with air cells—this makes it float well on water as well as a good insulator. Native Americans used tule for making and thatching huts, baskets, mats, boats, decoys, hats, clothing and shoes. Tule was typically cut using deer scapula saws that had <b>rough</b> <b>saw</b> like edges cut into them. Tule has to be handled with care when green to avoid breaking the stem and gains strength when it is partially dried.|$|E

50|$|Wall {{construction}} differs {{across the}} coach house complex. In the kitchen building {{the wall to}} the semi enclosed southern verandah is constructed from <b>rough</b> <b>sawn</b> vertical timber slabs spanning from the ground to the pitching point of the lean-to roof. In the boarding house {{the southern end of}} the east facing verandah has been enclosed with butt jointed pit sawn hardwood boards spanning vertically from floor level to the pitching point of the lean-to verandah roof. The eastern exterior wall to the boarding house is clad with dressed tongue and groove timber boards.|$|R
50|$|The coach house {{complex is}} {{established}} on a floor framing system consisting of hardwood stumps, <b>rough</b> <b>sawn</b> hardwood drop log bearers, pit sawn hardwood joists and floor boards. Exterior walls to both buildings are timber framed {{with the dominant}} wall construction for both structures being a system of vertically expressed hardwood posts housed into bed log bearers and extended up to meet a hardwood top plate. Smaller twin sections of timber are fixed to posts to create rebates running {{the length of the}} post. Pit sawn timber slabs are stacked horizontally into these rebates to create the wall membrane.|$|R
50|$|Internal framing is {{provided}} by substantial timber columns, bearers and joists, with ceilings lined with galvanised ripple iron {{to the ground and}} first floors. Steel box beams are also used in some areas to increase clear spans. Flooring consists of <b>rough</b> <b>sawn</b> timber boards, some areas of which have been sheeted over, and piers to the basement and sub-floor are masonry. The roof has timber framed trusses with bolted connections, forming a saw-tooth profile, with glass louvred clerestory windows. Ceilings are lined on the rake with beaded tongue and groove boarding, and the roof is sheeted with corrugated iron.|$|R
5000|$|Also in North America, {{hardwood}} lumber is commonly sold in a [...] "quarter" [...] system, {{when referring to}} thickness; 4/4 (four quarter) refers to a 1 in board, 8/4 (eight quarter) is a 2 in board, etc. This [...] "quarter" [...] system is rarely used for softwood lumber; although softwood decking is sometimes sold as 5/4, {{even though it is}} actually one-inch thick (from milling 1/8th inch off each side in a motorized planing step of production).The [...] "quarter" [...] system of reference is a traditional (cultural) North American lumber industry nomenclature used specifically to indicate the thickness of <b>rough</b> <b>sawn</b> {{hardwood lumber}}.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This is {{the second}} {{in a series of}} three papers {{concerned}} with the removal mechanisms of workpiece materials during the grinding of natural granite with diamond abrasive tools. In Part 1, the morphological features were examined for the granite surfaces and three main mineral compositions during grinding under machining parameters widely ranging from <b>rough</b> <b>sawing</b> to fine grinding. This second part is devoted to studying the formation mechanisms for surface gloss through monitoring the surface roughness and gloss readings on the granite surfaces during vertical spindle grinding with six different diamond mesh sizes. As a comparison, experiments were also conducted for two manually grinding methods. Coupled with an XRD detection of the ground surfaces and a measurement of the temperatures reached at the workpiece-tool contact zone, the gloss reading on a granite surface was found to be closely associated with the value of roughness generated on the granite surface. The gloss reading was found to increase with reducing surface roughness in an exponential curve, which provides an important basis for more efficiently producing better gloss finish on granite surfaces...|$|R
50|$|The street {{elevation}} of See Poy House {{was typical of}} an interwar Queenslander house; however its materials and special features reflect the wealth and standing of the family. It was noticeably larger than a standard house at 670 m2 in area and featured specially selected timbers (black bean, white hickory and silky oak), brass fittings and leadlight windows. During construction, <b>rough</b> <b>sawn</b> hardwood timber was transported from Maryborough and dressed on site. The use of mortised joints and anchor bolts cyclone-proofed the house. Leadlight windows and 12 ft (3.65 m) high ceilings were notable features of {{the interior of the}} house. It comprised a typical room format for a large interwar house being formal dining and lounge rooms, main bedroom, bathroom, second bedroom, study and kitchen. Verandahs were located on both sides and {{at the rear of the}} house. Balustrades were solid, other than decorative timber batten panels centred beneath timber bracket arches with side openings. The battening pattern used was consistent throughout: below arched openings and on the front stair balustrade in the infill latticework. The house cost between £1,200 and £2,000.|$|R
5000|$|At first only {{displayed}} in the Vermeil Room in a museum like setting, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy on recommendation of her friend Rachel Lambert Mellon began using the collection for the display of flowers and fruit in the rooms on the state floor.During the Kennedy White House restoration, interior designer Stéphane Boudin proposed painting the room in a style used in 17th and 18th century England and Normandy. Boudin had used a similar treatment in the Blue Bedroom at Leeds Castle in Kent, England. Rather than attempting to putty and polish the <b>rough</b> <b>sawn</b> timbers he chose to highlight the porous texture of the paneling. The walls were first rubbed down with wire brushes {{to bring up the}} grain and create an [...] "aged" [...] surface. Next a solid coat of off-white paint was applied, and that was followed by a [...] "dragged" [...] coating of blue paint. This was sealed using a bar of wax dabbed in pure dry blue pigment, and finally the surface was lightly distressed to tiny specks of white in the underlying base coat.|$|R

5000|$|The fence {{construction}} generally {{consists of}} 3 or 4 parts: uprights {{put together in}} pairs, round poles laid horizontally or diagonally between the two uprights, and binding cord usually made from young saplings - and sometimes also diagonal bracing. The fence is usually 1.5-2 metres tall. The fencing can also incorporate specially made stiles and gates. The fence requires an abundance of wood, which was never a problem in Scandinavia, as the trees generally came from the owners' own forests {{in the process of}} thinning them out. The term ″roundpole fence" [...] is somewhat misleading, as the rails between the pairs of uprights are usually split spruce logs. However, the upright poles are always round, young spruce trees with a diameter of 5 to 7 cm. For the diagonals, larger trees with a diameter up to 20 cm were split into four or eight rails of suitable dimensions. Very young saplings were used to bind the rails to the uprights, the idea being to utilize trees of different ages. In more recent times, <b>rough</b> <b>sawn</b> boards have also been used, preferably the outer boards of a log, with one curved side. The binding of saplings have also been replaced by steel wire.|$|R

40|$|A project {{recording}} {{an image}} based interpretive educational program informing regional {{communities of the}} potential for preservation of important historical farm buildings has stimulated a great deal of interest. This paper reflects on the project which identified a distinctive series of iconic farm buildings along the New South Wales Pacific Highway for their heritage value and developed a tourist route to promote them to visitors and residents. The 40 km section of the Pacific Highway from Maclean to Grafton is quite rare. There are well over 40 farm sheds visible from the Highway, most just metres away from passing traffic. While few sheds are individually of high heritage value, as a collection of sheds and in the particular landscape they are located, they provide an opportunity to recognise, interpret and manage a significant cultural resource. In this densely settled and diverse cultural setting visitors as well as residents are engaged by the humble 2 ̆ 7 rude 2 ̆ 7 shed. The materials are diverse. While <b>rough</b> <b>sawn</b> hardwood and corrugated iron predominates there is evidence of brick, block, fibro, sawn timber, wire mesh and more The sheds are the link to a formal regional identity through rural pursuits and diverse collaborative endeavours The project documents over 40 farm buildings through photography, drawing, story telling and design dimensions underpinned by research {{on the history of the}} buildings, through interviews with property owners and extensive recording of oral history of district settlers describing their experience of primary production; develops interpretive material for touring exhibitions; and prepares print collateral through partnerships with numerous individuals and groups.
