40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{a lesson}} developed to help {{junior high school}} students understand <b>rocks</b> <b>and</b> minerals.

The students of the control group received a normal lesson on <b>rocks</b> <b>and</b> minerals. The students of the experimental group recieved the normal lesson as well as an additional lesson on the differences between material structure and the terminological structure of <b>rocks</b> <b>and</b> minerals.

5|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> roll {{developed}} out of country, blues, and R Rock's exact {{origins and}} early influences have been hotly debated, {{and are the}} subjects of much scholarship. Though squarely in the blues tradition, rock took elements from Afro-Caribbean and Latin musical techniques. Rock was an urban style, formed in the areas where diverse populations resulted in the mixtures of African American, Latin and European genres ranging from the blues and country to polka and zydeco. <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> roll first entered popular music through a style called rockabilly, which fused the nascent sound with elements of country music. Black-performed <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> roll had previously had limited mainstream success, {{but it was the}} white performer Elvis Presley who first appealed to mainstream audiences with a black style of music, becoming one of the best-selling musicians in history, and brought <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> roll to audiences across the world.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the roles of the two ROCK isoforms, <b>ROCK</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ROCK</b> 2, in these responses. Methods: Wildtype mice <b>and</b> heterozygous <b>ROCK</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ROCK</b> 2 knockout mice (<b>ROCK</b> 1 +/- <b>and</b> <b>ROCK</b> 2 +/- respectively) were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin. <b>ROCK</b> expression <b>and</b> activation were assessed by Western blotting.

Results: Compared to wildtype mice, <b>ROCK</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ROCK</b> 2 expression were 50 % lower in lungs of <b>ROCK</b> 1 +/- <b>and</b> <b>ROCK</b> 2 +/- mice, respectively, without changes in the other isoform.
