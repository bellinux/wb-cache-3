5|$|Physicians: There are {{multiple}} aspects as to why, financially, hospice care {{may be difficult}} to access. The first would relate to physician reluctance. As stated previously, when enrolled in hospice, the patient transitions from their primary insurance to having most of their care managed directly by the hospice. As hospices typically have a limited budget, expensive care may not be permitted by the hospice. Additionally, <b>reimbursement</b> <b>for</b> physician visits can be complicated and result in non-payment to physicians. Therefore, difficulty in authorizing expensive treatments and lack of payment for visits can be reasons for non-referral from a physician.|$|E

When he went bankrupt in 1958, Schindler left his wife and returned to Germany, where he failed at several business ventures and relied on financial support from Schindlerjuden ("Schindler Jews") – the people whose lives he had saved during the war. He was named Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government in 1963.

5|$|During the war, all {{the uranium}} from the Congo {{had gone to}} the United States, as had that {{captured}} in Europe by the Alsos Mission, even though some of it passed through British hands. The entire output of the Shinkolobwe mine was contracted to the Combined Development Trust until 1956, but in March 1946 there were fears that the mine might be exhausted in 1947, resulting in a severe uranium shortage. After some negotiation, Groves and Chadwick agreed on a division of uranium ore production, with everything up to March 1946 going to the United States, and supplies being shared equally thereafter. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 31 July 1946, the financial arrangements were adjusted. Previously, the two countries had split the costs equally; henceforth each would only pay for what they actually received. Britain was therefore able to secure the uranium it needed without having to outbid the United States, and paid for it in sterling, while receiving <b>reimbursement</b> <b>for</b> the supplies allocated to the United States in dollars, thus easing Britain's dollar shortage.|$|E
