2500|$|In {{addition}} to these accidents, MARTA trains have derailed four times in recent years. The most recent incident occurred at the Medical Center station on December 4, 2006 when a train carrying passengers was moved over a <b>rail</b> <b>switch.</b> [...] No injuries were reported. A previous derailment occurred in July 1996 during Atlanta's hosting of the Olympics. A paired car on a train which had developed mechanical problems was uncoupled from other cars at Indian Creek station (the last station on the east line). The train began rolling, crashing through the bumper {{at the end of}} the rail line and running off of the track. The train operator, the only person on board, received minor injuries. In June 1996 a minor derailment occurred at the junction between the North and Northeast lines; MARTA estimated 150 people were aboard. The derailment occurred when a rail supervisor told the train driver to reverse the train after realizing the train had gone the wrong way at a track split; a MARTA investigation of the incident showed the derailment caused $125,000 of damage to the train and track and caused injury to 16 passengers. And in August 1994 a minor derailment occurred at a switch between Candler Park and Inman Park. Approximately 20 passengers were on board and no one was injured.|$|E

50|$|The {{cause was}} that the {{locomotive}} for freight train No. 722 broke down between Phatthalung Station and Pak Khlong Station, so the locomotive for international express No. 35 uncoupled with its carriages (on platform 1) and went to couple with the freight cars of No. 722, to be pulled back to Phatthalung Station. However, as the train approached (to enter platform 2), the <b>rail</b> <b>switch</b> failed and No. 722 collided with the carriages of No. 35 on platform 1. The carriages of No. 35 derailed and collided with carriages of No. 457.|$|E

From Sullivan Square north, it is exposed to the weather and largely built on an embankment, rendering it more vulnerable. That section is receiving new heated third <b>rail,</b> <b>switch</b> heaters, and snow fences to reduce the impacts of inclement weather. The work requires bustitution of the line from Sullivan Square to Oak Grove on many weeknights.|$|E
50|$|It {{would be}} possible, at least theoretically, {{to build a}} <b>rail</b> <b>switch</b> with {{linkages}} strong enough {{that they would not}} bend under the force of the flanges of train wheels pushing one of the points away from the adjacent fixed rail, so that the points would never move during a trailing-point movement, at least as long as the speed of the train was not excessive. Then, in a trailing-point movement along the route that the points were not set to, the switch would not be damaged, but instead the train would derail. Obviously, it is preferable for the switch to give way and be damaged than for the train to derail, causing damage to it and possible injury or loss of life to people aboard the train or nearby.|$|E

50|$|Turnouts were {{originally}} built with straight switch blades, which ended at the pointed {{end with a}} sharp angle. These switches cause a bump when the train traverses in the turnout direction. The switch blades could be made with a curved point which meets the stockrail at a tangent, causing less of a bump, but the disadvantage is that the metal at the point is thin and necessarily weak. A solution to these conflicting requirements {{was found in the}} 1920s on the German Reichsbahn. The first step was to have different rail profile for the stock <b>rails</b> and <b>switch</b> <b>rails,</b> with the <b>switch</b> <b>rails</b> being about 25 mm less high, and stockier in the middle.|$|R
25|$|Where {{the signals}} and points (UK term) or <b>rail</b> <b>switches</b> (US) are power-operated, {{it can be}} {{worthwhile}} to signal each line in both directions, so that the double line becomes a pair of single lines. This allows trains to use one track where the other track is out of service due to track maintenance work, or a train failure, or for a fast train to overtake a slow train.|$|R
50|$|At 4:29 p.m. EST (21:29 UTC) on Wednesday, January 13, 1982, an {{eastbound}} train (Train 410) on the Orange Line derailed while {{backing up}} from an improperly closed <b>rail</b> <b>switch</b> called the Smithsonian Interlocking. The derailment occurred after the front wheelset followed one track and the rear wheelset followed another, after the train entered a track normally used to switch trains between the parallel tracks. The resulting derailment saw the train {{move in a}} diagonal fashion for 150 ft before coming to a stop {{just east of the}} Federal Triangle station. Due to its occurrence during the evening rush hour, 1,200 persons were reportedly aboard the train. The accident resulted in three fatalities and 25 injured. Both Orange and Blue Line service was suspended between McPherson Square and the Federal Center SW stations. The response to the incident was slowed due to emergency personnel already responding to the crash of Air Florida Flight 90 into the 14th Street Bridge thirty minutes earlier. Full service along the Metro did not reopen until the evening of January 15 following the removal of the wreckage from the tunnel.|$|E

5000|$|Shaw's {{landmark}} {{opinion in}} favor of labor was incongruous with his politics and other jurisprudence. Shaw wrote his opinion in Hunt just one week after he decided another landmark labor case, Farwell v. Boston & Worcester R.R. Corp. In that case, Shaw upheld the fellow-servant rule by deciding that a railroad company could not be held liable when a mistake by an employee operating a <b>rail</b> <b>switch</b> caused an injury to another employee. [...] As the outcome in Farwell would suggest, Shaw was not ordinarily considered a friend of labor. [...] Walter Nelles wrote that, “The constituency to which Shaw was keenest comprised State Street and Beacon Hill, the bankers, the textile manufacturers, the railway builders.” [...] Nelles theorized that Shaw was more concerned with tariff protection than with labor concerns, and that his decision in Hunt {{was a product of}} strategic consideration. Nelles notes that in 1842, {{in the middle of a}} depression, labor unrest in the textile mills that drove much of Boston’s economy was very unlikely. [...] However, Whigs like Shaw may have been concerned that agitating the working class would help bring the Democratic party to power in the election of 1844. [...] Whigs worried that the Democrats would abolish the tariffs protecting the weakened textile industry. Shaw’s decision in Hunt, therefore, may have been motivated by a desire to placate Boston’s working class.|$|E

40|$|The utility {{communications}} equipment market consists of conservative adopters of new technology, who {{have started to}} embrace Ethernet technology for their substation distribution communications. GE Lentronics is developing an industrial Ethernet switch for this developing market. Examination of external factors reveals a market that is in a growth phase.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a two-step technique for real-time track detection in single-track railway sidings using low-cost MEMS gyroscopes. The {{objective is to}} reliably know the path the train has taken in a switch, diverted or main road, immediately after the train head leaves the switch. The signal delivered by the gyroscope is first processed by an adaptive low-pass filter that rejects noise and converts the temporal turn rate data in degree/second units into spatial turn rate data in degree/meter. The conversion {{is based on the}} travelled distance taken from odometer data. The filter is implemented to achieve a speed-dependent cut-off frequency to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. Although direct comparison of the filtered turn rate signal with a predetermined threshold is possible, the paper shows that better detection performance can be achieved by processing the turn rate signal with a filter matched to the <b>rail</b> <b>switch</b> curvature parameters. Implementation aspects of the track detector have been optimized for real-time operation. The detector has been tested with both simulated data and real data acquired in railway campaigns...|$|E
