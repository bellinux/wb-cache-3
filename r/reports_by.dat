5|$|Due to its sharp {{turns with}} {{restricted}} headroom, high-sided vehicles can only use the left-hand lane {{of the western}} tunnel, {{so it was not}} possible to reverse the tidal flow in the evening. On 20 April 2007 the morning tidal flow was discontinued, after <b>reports</b> <b>by</b> TfL and the Metropolitan Police (MPS) of an increase in dangerous motoring behaviour; these blamed poor driving, such as overtaking, for the decrease in safety during counterflow operations. The decision to end the counterflow was controversial, particularly as TfL and the MPS had been considering it since 2005, without properly informing affected borough councils, and an independent committee was set up to evaluate the decision. The ending of the counterflow system has brought protests from users of the tunnel and those experiencing increased congestion due to the change.|$|E

5|$|French {{casualties}} {{are hard}} to calculate, as the best available source is the vague totals submitted by Duckworth in his account to the Admiralty. He estimates, apparently based on <b>reports</b> <b>by</b> the senior remaining French officers on Alexandre, Jupiter and Brave, that those three ships suffered 760 casualties in total. These accounts were subsequently called into question by historian William James, who considered them too high. James also criticised the assumed totals for Impérial and Diomède, which are even less certain but reportedly totalled 500 and 250 respectively. In addition to those killed and wounded, the entire surviving crews of Alexandre, Jupiter and Brave were taken prisoner, as were 150 men from Diomède and six from Impérial seized by British boarding parties on 8 February.|$|E

30|$|To {{calculate}} {{recall and}} precision, we considered that true positives are instances (classes or methods) {{present in the}} code smell reference list that are also <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> the tool being assessed. False positives are instances that are not present in the reference list, but they were <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> the tool. False negatives are instances present in the reference list that were not <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> the tool. Finally, true negatives are instances that are not present in the reference list and were also not <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> the tool. Therefore, recall {{is the number of}} true positives divided by the number of instances in the reference list (true positives + false negatives), while precision in the number of true positives divided by the number of instances <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> the tool (true positives + false positives).|$|R
