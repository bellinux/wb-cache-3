5|$|Some {{nuclear safety}} {{agencies}} make recommendations {{about the use}} of thorium mantles and have raised safety concerns regarding their manufacture and disposal; the <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> from one mantle is not a serious problem, but that from many mantles gathered together in factories or landfills is.|$|E
5|$|Exposure {{is raised}} {{for people who}} live near thorium deposits, {{radioactive}} waste disposal sites, those who live near or work in uranium, phosphate, or tin processing factories, {{and for those who}} work in gas mantle production. Thorium is especially common in the Tamil Nadu coastal areas of India, where residents may be exposed to a naturally occurring <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> ten times higher than the worldwide average.|$|E
5|$|The decay {{products}} of 232Th include more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon. Although relatively little of those products is created {{as the result}} of the slow decay of thorium, a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of 232Th must include the contribution of its daughters, some of which are dangerous gamma emitters, and which are built up quickly following the initial decay of 232Th due to the absence of long-lived nuclides along the decay chain. As the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thorium dioxide, they are volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use. In the first hour of use large fractions of the thorium daughters 224Ra, 228Ra, 212Pb, and 212Bi are released. Most of the <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> by a normal user arises from inhaling the radium, resulting in a <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> of up to 0.2millisieverts per use, about a third of the dose sustained during a mammogram.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{variability}} of erythemal ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from Hradec Králové (Czech Republic) in the period 1964 – 2013. The EUV radiation time series was reconstructed using a radiative transfer model and additional empirical relationships with the {{root mean square error}} of 9. 9  %. The reconstructed time series documented the increase in EUV <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> in the 1980 s and the 1990 s (up to 15  % per decade), which is linked to the steep decline in total ozone (10  % per decade). The changes of cloud cover were the major factor affecting the EUV <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> especially in the 1960 s, 1970 s, and {{at the beginning of the}} new millennium. The mean annual EUV <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> in the decade 2004 – 2013 declined by 5  %. The factors affecting the EUV <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> differed also according to the chosen integration period (daily, monthly, and annually) : solar zenith angle was the most important for daily doses, cloud cover for their monthly means, and the annual means of EUV <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> were most influenced by total ozone column. The number of days with very high EUV <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> increased by 22  % per decade, the increase was statistically significant in all seasons except autumn. The occurrence of the days with very high EUV doses was influenced mostly by low total ozone column (82  % of days), clear-sky or partly cloudy conditions (74  % of days) and by increased surface albedo (19  % of days). The principal component analysis documented that the occurrence of days with very high EUV <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> was much affected by the positive phase of North Atlantic Oscillation with an Azores High promontory reaching over central Europe. In the stratosphere, a strong Arctic circumpolar vortex and also the meridional inflow of ozone-poor air from the south-west were favorable for the occurrence of days with very high EUV <b>radiation</b> <b>doses.</b> This is the first analysis of the relationship between the high EUV <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> and macro-scale circulation patterns, and therefore more attention should be given also to other dynamical variables that may affect the solar UV radiation on the Earth surface...|$|R

5|$|Thallium has 25 {{isotopes}} {{which have}} atomic masses {{that range from}} 184 to 210. 203Tl and 205Tl are the only stable isotopes and make up nearly all of natural thallium. 204Tl is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 3.78 years. It is made by the neutron activation of stable thallium in a nuclear reactor. The most useful radioisotope, 201Tl (half-life 73 hours), decays by electron capture, emitting X-rays (~70–80keV), and photons of 135 and 167keV in 10% total abundance; therefore, it has good imaging characteristics without excessive patient <b>radiation</b> <b>dose.</b> It {{is the most popular}} isotope used for thallium nuclear cardiac stress tests.|$|E
5|$|Without the {{protection}} of the Earth's atmosphere, cosmonauts were exposed to higher levels of radiation from a steady flux of cosmic rays and trapped protons from the South Atlantic Anomaly. The station's crews were exposed to an absorbed dose of about 5.2cGy {{over the course of a}} 115-day expedition, producing an equivalent dose of 14.75cSv, or 1133µSv per day. This daily dose is approximately that received from natural background radiation on Earth in two years. The radiation environment of the station was not uniform; closer proximity to the station's hull led to an increased <b>radiation</b> <b>dose,</b> and the strength of radiation shielding varied between modules; Kvant-2's being better than the core module, for instance.|$|E
40|$|Both bisphosphonates and {{radiotherapy}} {{are highly}} effective {{for the management}} of bone metastases. Our in vitro study examined the cytotoxic effects resulting from combinations of ibandronate and ionising radiations (RX) in various sequences on breast cancer cells. Single <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> were given before, at halftime of, or after acute ibandronate incubation (48 h). Single or fractionated <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> were applied at the end of chronic ibandronate incubation (5 weeks). Combination of acute ibandronate exposure and single <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> led to synergistic cytotoxic effects in MDA-MB- 231 cell line, but only with low ibandronate concentrations in MCF- 7 cell line. In both cell lines, synergy was more marked when ibandronate followed RX. After long-term ibandronate exposure, only high single <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> induced synergistic effects in MDA-MB- 231 cell line. Synergy was only detected with low ibandronate concentrations in MCF- 7 cell line. In both cell lines, fractionated <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> exerted similar effects. The combination of ibandronate with radiation can exert synergistic effects on the inhibition of breast cancer cells growth, depending on cell line, drug sequence and dosage. Our data might provide a rationale for associating bisphosphonates and radiotherapy for the treatment of bone metastases from breast cancer. Evaluation StudiesJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

5|$|Another {{major issue}} {{is the amount of}} {{radiation}} to which a space probe is subjected, due to the harsh charged-particle environment around Jupiter (for a detailed explanation see Magnetosphere of Jupiter). For example, when Pioneer 11 made its closest approach to the planet, the level of radiation was ten times more powerful than Pioneers designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probes would not survive. With a few minor glitches, the probe managed to pass through the radiation belts, but it lost most of the images of the moon Io, as the radiation had caused Pioneers imaging photo polarimeter to receive false commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the radiation levels. Over the eight years the Galileo spacecraft orbited the planet, the probe's <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> far exceeded its design specifications, and its systems failed on several occasions. The spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors, and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and non-rotating parts, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileos ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E
25|$|As a result, the <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> {{from nuclear}} {{medicine}} imaging varies greatly {{depending on the}} type of study.

40|$|Background: Radiation {{exposure}} due to {{computed tomography}} (CT) {{has become an}} important issue, {{as the number of}} CT examinations has been increasing worldwide. <b>Radiation</b> <b>doses</b> associated with CT are higher in comparison to other imaging procedures. CT-related <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> should be monitored and controlled in order to ensure reduction of radiation exposure and optimization of image quality. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> in adult patient who underwent routine CT brain examinations, and to assess how CT scanning protocols affect patient doses in practice. Material/Methods: A total of 118 patients underwent brain CT at two radiology departments equipped with 64 -slice CT scanners, Khartoum, Sudan. Patient doses regarding weighted CT dose index (CTDIw) and dose length product (DLP) values were recorded. Quality control tests were performed for both scanners. Results: The mean CTDIw values ranged from 62. 9 to 65. 8 mGy, DLP values ranged from 1003. 7 to 1192. 5 mGy, and the effective dose varied from 2. 4 to 3. 7 mSv. Conclusions: Patient doses in this study was higher compared to previous research, suggesting that patients exposed to unnecessary radiation. Therefore, optimization of <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> with the use of specified imaging protocols, well-documented indications for CT, training of technicians, and quality control programs will reduce the necessary <b>radiation</b> <b>doses.</b> Establishment of the diagnostic reference level is recommended for further dose reduction...|$|R
