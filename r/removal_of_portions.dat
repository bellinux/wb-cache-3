The result was Metavid's <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>portions</b> of the archive produced with C-SPAN's cameras, while preserving its archive of government-produced content. C-SPAN also engaged in actions to stop parties from making unauthorized uses of its content online, including its video of House and Senate proceedings. Most notably, in May 2006, C-SPAN requested the removal of Stephen Colbert's performance at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner from YouTube. After concerns by some webloggers, C-SPAN gave permission for Google Video to host the full event. On March 7, 2007 C-SPAN liberalized its copyright policy for current, future, and past coverage of any official events sponsored by Congress and any federal agency and now allows for attributed non-commercial copying, sharing, and posting of C-SPAN video on the Internet, excluding re-syndication of live video streams.

2500|$|Docking is the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>portions</b> of an animal's tail. While docking and bobbing {{are more}} {{commonly}} {{used to refer to}} removal of the tail, the term cropping [...] is used in reference to the ears. Tail docking occurs in one of two ways. The first involves constricting the blood supply to the tail with a rubber ligature for a few days until the tail falls off. The second involves the severance of the tail with surgical scissors or a scalpel. [...] The length to which tails are docked varies by breed, and is often specified in the breed standard.|$|E

50|$|The last {{option for}} TM {{treatment}} includes surgical <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>portions</b> of the thyroid {{which can also}} be performed to restore thyroid homeostasis. This treatment option usually is done when overproduction of TM is caused by multinodular goiters. Since these goiters enlarge the thyroid and can cause the patient to become physically disfigured surgical treatment can alleviate both the aesthetic and physiological effects simultaneously.|$|E
5000|$|Cropping {{of large}} {{portions}} of the pinnae of other animals is rare, although the clipping of identifying shapes in the pinnae of livestock, called earmarks, was common prior {{to the introduction of}} compulsory ear tags. [...] <b>Removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>portions</b> of the ear of laboratory mice for identification, i.e. ear-notching, is still used. The practice of cropping for cosmetic purposes is rare in non-canines, although some selectively bred animals have naturally small ears which can be mistaken for cropping.|$|E
50|$|In 1922, Glen Lake Sanatorium doctors first {{adopted and}} {{performed}} a surgical procedure known as artificial pneumothorax, which collapsed the lung affected by pulmonary tuberculosis. Collapse inhibited {{the proliferation of}} tubercle bacilli and stimulated the formation of scar tissue that controlled the disease. Another method, called extrapleural thoracoplasty, involved <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>portions</b> of several ribs to collapse the chest wall. Phrenic nerve interruption was introduced to Glen Lake in 1924. This paralysis of the diaphragm reduced movement of the affected lung.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} prevent further cysts and infections from forming, the thyroglossal duct {{and all of its}} {{branches}} are removed from the throat and neck area. A procedure, known as the Sistrunk procedure, is considered to be the standard procedure and involves <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>portions</b> of the hyoid bone and core tissue of the suprahyoid region. Cysts will often reoccur if the entire duct is not removed, so reoccurrence requires a wider range of tissue to be removed in a subsequent surgery.|$|E

The film was reduced from 100 to 93 minutes. Both {{the original}} and Redux versions can still be found on Asian markets, while only the Redux version is available to western markets. Several criticisms of the Redux version have been noted, such as poor image quality and color mastering from the source material, cropping and <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>portions</b> of the bottom image, poor English translations, and the re-scoring.|$|E

5000|$|Fibular hemimelia or {{longitudinal}} fibular deficiency is [...] "the congenital {{absence of}} the fibula {{and it is the}} most common congenital absence of long bone of the extremities." [...] It is the shortening of the fibula at birth, or the complete lack thereof. In humans, the disorder can be noted by ultrasound in utero to prepare for amputation after birth or complex bone lengthening surgery. The amputation usually takes place at six months with <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>portions</b> of the legs to prepare them for prosthetic use. The other treatments which include repeated corrective osteotomies and leg-lengthening surgery are costly and associated with residual deformity.|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{geologic}} mapping on a {{scale of}} 1 : 24, 000 has better defined the recharge areas of the Upper Floridan, Claiborne, Clayton and Cretaceous aquifers between the Flint River and the Chattachoochee River. Mapping over an eight year period that covered twenty-four 7. 5 ” quadrangles was funded, in part, by the U. S. Geological Survey’s STATEMAP program. In addition to classical field mapping, interpretive geologic maps of each quadrangle were derived and developed as GIS coverages. Field observations suggest the aquifer recharge areas are more complex than previous studies of ideal geologic sections. Several periods of extensive weathering and erosion in the geologic record, particularly in the current recharge areas of the Upper Floridan, Claiborne, Clayton and Cretaceous aquifers, have resulted in <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>portions</b> of the stratigraphic units that host these aquifers, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>portions</b> of the confining units, and adversely altered the porosity and permeability of the updip portions of these aquifers. Multiple episodes of paleo-groundwater movement recorded as cross-cutting alteration patterns in outcrops may further degrade optimal aquifer recharge in these areas. Previously unrecorded folding during the Tertiary may alter groundwater flow patterns, also. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division U. S.

40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} natural evolution of right diaphragmatic injury after the surgical <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> a <b>portion</b> from hemi diaphragm. Methods: {{the animals were}} submitted to a surgical <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>portion</b> from right hemi diaphragm by median laparotomy. The sample consists of 42 animals being 2 animals from pilot project and 40 operated animals. And the variables {{of the study were}} herniation, liver protection, healing, persistent diaphragm injury, evaluation of 16 channels tomography and the variables "heart rate" and "weight". Results: we analyzed 40 mice, we had two post-operative deaths; we had 17 animals in this group suffered from herniation (42. 5 %) and 23 animals didn't suffer from herniation (57. 5 %). Analyzing the tomography as image method in the evaluation of diaphragmatic hernia, we had as a method with good sensitivity (78. 6 %), good specificity (90. 9 %), and good accuracy (86. 1 %) when compared to necropsy. Conclusion: there was a predominance of healing of right hemi diaphragm, the size of initial injury didn't have influence on occurrence of the liver protection or hernia in mice...|$|R

40|$|Produced {{waters are}} {{characterized}} {{with respect to}} the amounts and chemical constituents generated in oil and gas production. <b>Removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>portions</b> of total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, volatile organic chemicals, and adsorbable organic chemicals were simulated and costs associated with each treatment scenario have been estimated. Treatment facility size is a key parameter in determining unit cost. Desalination was the most costly process evaluated. Produced water treatment costs range from 0. 25 to 35. 00 /m 3 and are dependent on the nature and level of treatment. Under the most cost-effective scenario, the industry-wide cost of removing emulsified oils and dissolved organic materials to a level suitable for coastal discharge is approximately 4. 00 /m 3. This translates to an annual industry-wide cost of some twenty billion dollars. Costs for reclaiming produced water for agricultural purposes may be as high as 35. 00 /m sp 3 due to desalting costs...|$|E
