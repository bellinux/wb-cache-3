5|$|Interstitial <b>radium</b> <b>therapy</b> {{was common}} in the 1930s. Gold seeds filled with radon were used as early as 1942 until at least 1958. Gold shells were {{selected}} by Gino Failla around 1920 to shield beta rays while passing gamma rays. Cobalt needles were also used briefly after world war II. Radon and cobalt were replaced by radioactive tantalum and gold, before iridium rose in prominence. First used in 1958, iridium is {{the most commonly used}} artificial source for brachytherapy today.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Rona {{was born}} on 20 March 1890 in Budapest, Hungary, to Ida, (née Mahler) and Samuel Róna. Her father was a prosperous Jewish {{physician}} who worked with Louis Wickham and Henri-August Dominici, founders of <b>radium</b> <b>therapy,</b> to introduce the techniques to Budapest, and installed {{one of the first}} x-ray machines there. Elizabeth wanted to become a physician like her father, but Samuel believed that it would be too difficult for a woman to attain. Though he died when she was in her second year of university, Rona's father had encouraged her and spurred her interest in science from a young age. She enrolled in the Philosophy Faculty at the University of Budapest, studying chemistry, geochemistry, and physics, receiving her PhD in 1912.|$|E

5000|$|Soon {{after the}} {{discovery}} of radium in 1898 by Marie Curie, there was speculation in whether the radiation {{could be used for}} therapy {{in the same way as}} that from x-rays. The physiological effect of radium was first observed in 1900 by Otto Walkhoff, and later confirmed by what famously known as the [...] "Becquerel burn". In 1901, Henri Becquerel had placed a tube of radium in a waistcoat pocket where it had remained for several hours; a week or two after which there was severe inflammation of his skin underneath where the radium had been kept. Ernest Besnier, a dermatologist, examined the skin and expressed the opinion that it was due to the radium, leading to experiments by Curie which confirmed it. Besnier suggested the use of <b>radium</b> for <b>therapy</b> along the same purposes as x-rays and ultraviolet rays.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of radioisotopes in healthcare {{is one of}} the prominent peaceful applications of atomic energy. Natural radioactivity was discovered by Henri Becquerel in 1896 and subsequently radioactive elements radium and polonium were discovered by Madam Curie in 1898. The value of treatment of cancerous conditions by radioactivity of radium was first demonstrated in 1901. Henri Alexandre Danlos and Eugene Bloch attempted treatment of tuberculosis skin lesions by placing radium in contact in the same year. In 1913 Frederick Proescher published the first study on the intravenous injection of <b>radium</b> for <b>therapy</b> of various diseases. Herrman Blumgart and Soma Weiss performed the first {{application of}} radioactive tracers in medical research in a study of the velocity of circulating blood in 1925. But the effective use of radioactivity in healthcare application had to wait the invention of artificial radioactivity by J. F Joliot-Curie and Irene Joliot-Curie in Paris in 1934 and production of radioisotopes by cyclotron invented by Ernest O. Lawrence in Berkeley in 1930 and by nuclear reactor demonstrated by Enrico Fermi and co-workers in Rom...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of men treated {{for prostate cancer}} will eventually develop castrate resistant disease (CRPC) with metastases (mCRPC). There are several options for further treatment: chemotherapy, third-line hormone <b>therapy,</b> <b>radium,</b> immunotherapy and palliation. Current ASCO guidelines for survivors of prostate cancer recommend that an individual’s information needs at all stages of disease are assessed, and that patients are provided with or referred to the appropriate sources for information and support. Earlier reviews have highlighted the dearth of such services and we wished {{to see if the}} situation had improved more recently. Unfortunately we conclude that there is still a lack of good quality congruent information easily accessible specifically for men with mCRPC and insufficient data regarding the risks, harms and benefits of different management plans.

40|$|DURING {{the past}} year there have been {{numerous}} allusions to the role to be played in medicine by the developments in atomic fission. The uninitiated reader might infer that such applications are something solely to be looked for in the future, contingent on a considerable amount of developmental re-search. There is no need to argue the need for fundamental investigation in this field. The need will always exist regardless of our progress. How-ever, {{for the better part of}} 10 years, methods and tools of nuclear physics have been applied to medicine. In general, this application has been in two directions. First, isotopes offer much promise in solving the mysteries of metabolic processes in the animal and human body. Second, the artificially produced radioactive isotopes have opened up such broad horizons in the treatment of malignant disease that they will ultimately in all likelihood far surpass x-ray and <b>radium</b> together in <b>therapy.</b> The metabolic use of isotopes and their diagnostic applications embrace such wide fields in physiology, biochemistry, medicine, surgery and biolog...|$|R

As for the amount of irradiation, an individual case receives 3 to 4 times of 33 mg. hour of irradiatiou for six hours at a time at the interval of seven days, which is considered as a round of teeatment. Usually only one round of such treatment has been given, but in some cases two or three rounds have been administered with 2 to 5 months' interval between the rounds. 2) Out of the 216 ears examined by an an audiometer 144 ears (66. 7 %) have recovered to the normal hearing; and the 61 ears given infant speech tests have likewise yielded approximately the same results. 3) In order to obtain a better result in the radium treatment, it is necessary to give first such treatments as the treatment for the fluid in the middle-ear cavity, adenoid, or sinusitis. 4) Out of 156 ears, 104 (60, 6 %) improed by the irradiation treatment. In these 104 cases the majority of them showed granular change of the Eustachian orifice or residual adenoid in the nasopharynx, and furthermore, these types were the ones to whom the irradiation treatment proved to be most effective. 5) As for the patency of the Eustachian tube, 63 ears (60 %) of 105 cases with severe stenosis showed improvement after the irradiation, while 38 ears (80 %) of 47 cases with mild stenosis improved, 6) As the relapse is apt to occur even more than one year after the treatment, it is necessary to carry on the periodical follow-up examinations...|$|R
5000|$|The Serafimerlasarett {{set up a}} radium {{diagnosis}} {{laboratory in}} 1903. In 1906 it was transferred from the medical department to the surgical department, whose chief, , appointed as its director Gösta Forssell, who had been researching radiotherapy. In 1910, this was succeeded by Radiumhemmet, which was established by charitable gifts as an independent institution for <b>radium</b> and X-ray <b>therapy</b> under Svenska Cancerforeningen, the Swedish Cancer Society. It was housed in an 8-room rented flat at 10 Scheelegatan on Kungsholmen, and had sixteen beds and one X-ray therapy unit. The name, which means [...] "Radium Home", was chosen to reassure patients. After promising results in gynaecological patients, the Stockholm Municipality provided funds for its expansion, with Queen Victoria matching them. Numbers of patients climbed steadily, from 342 to 742 between 1911 and 1914. Forssell hired as associates [...] and , and in 1916 the clinic moved to a building at 23 Fjällgatan, doubling the number of beds and {{increasing the number of}} X-ray units. At Forssell's request, the Swedish government promised patients free transportation from anywhere in Sweden; this is still in effect. In 1917 a separate gynaecological division was created with Heyman as its director, and Berven became head of the general clinic. In 1924 research divisions for tumour pathology and radiophysics were created.In celebration of King Gustav V's seventieth birthday in 1928, a fund of more than 5 million kronor, the , was created; the royal couple decided to dedicate it to clinics and medical research, which led to the establishment of institutions in Gothenburg and Lund on the model of Radiumhemmet, and the foundation of the Karolinska Hospital, now the Karolinska University Hospital. In 1936 Radiumhemmet and its Institutes of Radiopathology (directed by [...] ) and Radiophysics (directed by Rolf Maximilian Sievert) moved to the new university complex. With this move, Radiumhemmet became state-owned.|$|R

50|$|X-rays and radium {{were noted}} by {{physicians}} {{to have different}} advantages in different cases. The most marked effects produced with <b>radium</b> <b>therapy</b> were with lupus, ulcerous growths, and keloid, particularly because they could be applied more specifically to tissues than with x-rays. Radium was generally to be preferred when a localized reaction was desired, while for x-rays when a large area needed to be treated. Radium was also believed to be bactericidal, while x-rays were not. Because {{they could not be}} applied locally, x-rays were also found to have worse cosmetic effects than radium when treating malignancies. In certain cases, a combination of x-ray and <b>radium</b> <b>therapy</b> was suggested. In many skin diseases, the ulcers would be treated with radium and the surrounding areas with x-rays so it would positively affect the lymphatic systems.|$|E

50|$|The {{publication}} {{has undergone}} several changes throughout its history. The initial publication in 1906 was entitled the American Quarterly of Roentgenology, and was officially {{associated with the}} ARRS in 1909. In 1913, journal was renamed the American Journal of Roentgenology, and publication frequency was increased to a monthly basis under editor Preston M. Hickey. Hickey would remain editor-in-chief for approximately 10 years, and became a pioneering voice for evolution of radiologic education and reporting. With the advent of radiation therapy and nuclear medicine {{under the auspices of}} radiology, there was a period from 1920 to 1970's during which the ARRS began publishing articles on topics of radiation oncology and nuclear medicine in addition to diagnostic radiology. Accordingly, the journal was renamed American Journal of Roentgenology and <b>Radium</b> <b>Therapy</b> in 1922, and later the American Journal of Roentgenology, <b>Radium</b> <b>Therapy,</b> and Nuclear Medicine. Finally in 1976, the journal was once again renamed back to American Journal of Roentgenology at which time mandatory peer-review was implemented.|$|E
