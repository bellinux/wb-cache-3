5|$|Audioslave was an American rock {{supergroup}} {{formed in}} Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and <b>Rage</b> <b>Against</b> the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave {{as a combination}} of Soundgarden and <b>Rage</b> <b>Against</b> the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, {{it was noted that}} they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with <b>Rage</b> <b>Against</b> the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>Rage</b> <b>Against</b> the Machine and Soundgarden have {{reformed}} since Audioslave's breakup. <b>Rage</b> <b>Against</b> the Machine {{has performed}} at several live venues and other festivals since its initial {{performance at the}} Coachella Music Festival in April 2007, although the band currently {{has no plans to}} make a new album. Soundgarden announced a reunion in 2010 and recorded a new album, King Animal, which was released in November 2012.|$|E

5|$|And matters {{continued}} {{thus for}} a considerable time. But a sedition and civil war came upon the wretched people and turned their cruelty toward us against one another. So we breathed {{for a little while}} as they ceased from their <b>rage</b> <b>against</b> us. But presently the change from that milder reign was announced to us, and great fear of what was threatened seized us.|$|E

5|$|Peter Hitchens, with {{particular}} reference to events which {{occurred in the}} Soviet Union, argues that his brother's verdict on religion is misguided, and that faith in God is both a safeguard against the collapse of civilisation into moral chaos and the best antidote to what he views as the dangerous idea of earthly perfection through utopianism. The <b>Rage</b> <b>Against</b> God received a mostly favourable reception in the media.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Rage</b> <b>Against</b> God (subtitle in US editions: How Atheism Led Me to Faith) is {{the fifth}} book by Peter Hitchens, first {{published}} in 2010. The book describes Hitchens's journey from atheism, far-left politics, and bohemianism, to Christianity and conservatism, detailing the influences on him {{that led to his}} conversion.

Other notable Western performers, including Sting, have previously cancelled performances in the country over human rights concerns. West was reportedly paid US$3 million for his performance. West had previously participated in cultural boycotts, joining Shakira and <b>Rage</b> <b>Against</b> The Machine in refusing to perform in Arizona after the 2010 implementation of stop and search laws directed against potential illegal aliens.|$|E
5|$|Initial rumors {{suggested}} that Cornell {{took issue with}} having two managers {{actively involved in the}} project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled <b>Rage</b> <b>Against</b> the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rage</b> <b>Against</b> the Machine {{released}} its final studio album, {{a collection of}} cover versions called Renegades, in 2000, reaching number 14 on the Billboard 200.

5|$|To {{promote their}} album, {{in the summer}} of 1992 the band went on two two-week tours of the Western area of the United States. In the fall, they {{embarked}} on a two-and-a-half month national tour. Due to the commercial failure of their album, Interscope refused to support the tour, leaving the band to finance it themselves. They played alongside bands such as <b>Rage</b> <b>Against</b> the Machine, Ugly Kid Joe, Sublime, Dance Hall Crashers, 311, Public Enemy, Pato Banton and The Special Beat.|$|E
5|$|By 27 April, Berlin was cut {{off from}} the rest of Germany. Secure radio {{communications}} with defending units had been lost; the command staff in the bunker had to depend on telephone lines for passing instructions and orders and on public radio for news and information. On 28 April, a BBC report originating from Reuters was picked up; a copy of the message was given to Hitler. The report stated that Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler had offered to surrender to the western Allies; the offer had been declined. Himmler had implied to the Allies that he had the authority to negotiate a surrender; Hitler considered this treason. During the afternoon his anger and bitterness escalated into a <b>rage</b> <b>against</b> Himmler. Hitler ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's headquarters in Berlin) shot.|$|E
