5|$|In {{order to}} resolve {{the problem of the}} {{excessive}} growth of phumdis that affects the lake ecosystem and local community, a study sponsored by the IndiaCanada Environment Facility was undertaken by the Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) to examine efficient ways of converting phumdis into briquettes as fodder and fuel pellets, which could be used to meet both energy demands within the region. Two options for the biomass conversion were studied. The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel. The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher crude fibre and crude protein content, but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose. The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12% de-oiled <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> was found to be feasible for using them as fodder. The lower portion, which was densified to make fuel pellets, was found to be suitable for use as fuel. Such pellets were found to have an average calorific value of 3,400calories per kilogram (14,200kJ/kg) with ash content of 27%. Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population.” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake, thus converting the waste into wealth. The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners; this is reported to have been implemented.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In 2010, 50 {{indica rice}} {{varieties}} were cultivated in three sites in southwestern China along a contamination gradient (background, moderately-contaminated and highly-contaminated sites) to determine environment and genotype controls on MeHg accumulation in polished white <b>rice</b> and <b>bran.</b> <b>Rice</b> grain MeHg concentrations {{were significantly higher}} in the moderately-contaminated site {{compared to the other}} two sites (ANOVA, p< 0. 0001). Lower rice grain MeHg concentrations in the highly-contaminated site possibly reflected differences in surface water pH (highly-contaminated site: pH 11, other two sites: pH 7. 6 - 8. 0). More alkaline conditions at the highly-contaminated site possibly decreased the bioavailability of MeHg and/or other trace elements, thus lowering the uptake of MeHg from paddy soil to rice grain. Polished white rice MeHg concentrations were significantly associated with rice genotype (p< 0001), indicating there may be genetic markers associated with the translocation of MeHg from the maternal tissue to the filial tissue (i. e., from the bran to the polished grain). Additionally, low MeHg-accumulating rice varieties were identified, which decreased MeHg exposure up to 69 %, and may be recommended to farmers to mitigate MeHg accumulation in rice grain...|$|R
25|$|Vitamin B was {{originally}} {{considered to have}} two components, a heat-labile vitamin B1 and a heat-stable vitamin B2. In the 1920s, vitamin B2 {{was thought to be}} the factor necessary for preventing pellagra. In 1923, Paul Gyorgy in Heidelberg was investigating egg-white injury in rats; the curative factor for this condition was called vitamin H (which is now called biotin or vitamin B7). Since both pellagra and vitamin H deficiency were associated with dermatitis, Gyorgy decided to test the effect of vitamin B2 on vitamin H deficiency in rats. He enlisted the service of Wagner-Jauregg in Kuhn’s laboratory. In 1933, Kuhn, Gyorgy, and Wagner found that thiamin-free extracts of yeast, liver, or <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> prevented the growth failure of rats fed a thiamin-supplemented diet.|$|E

In Japan in 1968, 280kg of PCB-contaminated <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> oil was used as chicken feed, resulting in a mass poisoning, known as Yushō disease, in over 1800 people. Common symptoms included dermal and ocular lesions, irregular menstrual cycles and lowered immune responses. Other symptoms included fatigue, headaches, coughs, and unusual skin sores. Additionally, in children, there were reports of poor cognitive development. Women exposed to PCBs before or during pregnancy can give birth to children with lowered cognitive ability, immune compromise, and motor control problems.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{nightingale}} excrement {{dates back}} to the Heian period (AD7941185) when it was introduced to the Japanese by the Koreans. Koreans used the guano to remove dye from kimono fabric, allowing them to make intricate designs on the clothing. The Japanese used the bird droppings to remove stains from silk garments such as kimonos. Then, during the Edo period (AD 16031868), the Japanese expanded its use by using it as a beauty treatment. Some sources, however, report that as early as the third century Japanese women used bags of <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> and supplies of nightingale droppings to whiten their skin. Geishas and kabuki actors used heavy white makeup that contained zinc and lead, which likely caused many issues such as skin diseases. Uguisu no fun was used to thoroughly remove this makeup and to whiten and balance skin tone. Also, Buddhist monks used the droppings to polish and clean their bald scalps.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{total and}} phytic phosphorus and endogenous phytase activity in cereals, oilseeds and by-products, feed ingredients used in animal {{production in the}} tropics were evaluated.

In five samples of each ingredient, phytic acid was measured by a colorimetric procedure and phytase activity with an enzymatic-colorimetric method. In addition, mineral and chemical components were determined by conventional methods. Crude protein, ether extract, ash and mineral content were similar to values reported in feed composition tables. Total P concentration in cereal grains and by-products ranged from 0. 12 to 1. 57 %, and in oilseeds and by-products, from 0. 43 to 1. 34 %. In cereals and oilseeds, phytic acid concentrations varied from 0. 08 to 0. 49 %, and in by-products, from 0. 24 to 1. 13 %. Significant regressions were found between total and phytic P in cereals and by-products, and in oilseeds and by-products.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{a range of}} anti-diabetic related properties and some consumer preferred physicochemical properties of selected Sri Lankan traditional rice varieties. Methods: Sudu Heeneti, Goda Heeneti, Masuran and Dik Wee varieties were used in this study. Anti-diabetic related properties of bran extracts of selected varieties were studied for methylglyoxal mediated protein glycation inhibition, acetyl and butyryl-cholinesterase inhibition in vitro and anti-hyperglycemic activity in vivo. Further, selected varieties were studied for starch hydrolysis rate in vitro. Physicochemical properties including grain color, size, shape, crude protein, crude fat, ash, dietary fiber and total carbohydrate contents were studied. Results: Brans of selected varieties had significant (P < 0. 05) and dose dependent methylglyoxal mediated protein glycation inhibition [IC 50 : (174. 77 ± 6. 65) to (342. 87 ± 0. 43) µg/mL] and acetyl [(IC 50 : (37. 00 ± 0. 68) to (291. 00 ± 3. 54) µg/mL] and butyryl-cholinesterase [IC 50 : (18. 50 ± 0. 60) to (96. 60 ± 0. 56) µg/mL] inhibitory activities. Further, Sudu Heeneti, Masuran and Dik Wee had low starch digestion rate (52. 40 ± 1. 44 to 53. 76 ± 1. 19) indicating that these varieties may be low glycemic index <b>rices.</b> <b>Brans</b> of Masuran tested in rat model showed anti-hyperglycemic activity.
