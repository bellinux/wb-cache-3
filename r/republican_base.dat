5|$|McCain had {{fundraising}} {{problems in}} the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was unpopular among the <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> electorate. Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race. Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed. McCain slumped badly in national polls, often running third or fourth with 15percent or less support.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 1873, {{the state}} {{legislature}} passed a bill re-enfranchising ex-Confederates, {{to the delight of}} much of the state population and the concern of the Minstrels. The legislature called a special election in November to replace 33 members, mostly Minstrels, who had left for patronage jobs in the Baxter government. Baxter refused to let the Minstrels manipulate the election, declaring that free, honest elections would be held during his term. With the help of the newly re-enfranchised voters, conservative Democrats swept the election and gained a small majority in the legislature. Baxter was about to erode his <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> out from under him.|$|E
5|$|The Arizona senator {{subsequently}} {{resumed his}} familiar {{position as a}} political underdog, riding the Straight Talk Express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events. By December 2007, the Republican race was unsettled, {{with none of the}} top-tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> electorate. McCain was showing a resurgence, in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire– the scene of his 2000 triumph– and was bolstered further by the endorsements of The Boston Globe, the New Hampshire Union Leader, and almost two dozen other state newspapers, as well as from Senator Lieberman (now an Independent Democrat). McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3, 2008, Iowa caucuses, which saw a win by former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee.|$|E

25|$|McCain's {{second quarter}} 2007 {{fundraising}} results and campaign financials were poor. Both McCain supporters and political observers pointed to McCain's {{support for the}} Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, very unpopular among the <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> electorate, as a primary cause of his fundraising problems.|$|E
25|$|With the {{election}} of Ulysses S. Grant in 1868, the Radicals had control of Congress, {{the party and the}} army and attempted to build a solid <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> in the South using the votes of Freedmen, Scalawags and Carpetbaggers, supported directly by U.S. Army detachments. Republicans all across the South formed local clubs called Union Leagues that effectively mobilized the voters, discussed issues and when necessary fought off Ku Klux Klan (KKK) attacks. Thousands died on both sides.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> in Virginia {{consists}} of the state's traditional Republican heartland in the Blue Ridge Mountains, social conservatives in the Shenandoah Valley and suburbanites in the east. McCain closely matched George W. Bush's numbers among the first group and only did slightly worse than Bush amongst the second group. However, in 2008, suburbanites in Northern Virginia and in the Richmond/Hampton Roads areas abandoned the Republican Party in droves, and it was simply impossible for McCain to win the state without their support.|$|E

25|$|Historically speaking, the <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> {{initially}} {{consisted of}} northern white Protestants and African-Americans nationwide, {{with the first}} Presidential candidate, John C. Fremont, receiving almost no votes in the South. This trend continued into the 20th century, with 1944 Republican presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey having only 10% of his popular votes in the South. After the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the core base shifted considerably, with the Southern United States becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics, and the Northeastern United States becoming more reliably Democratic, especially since 1992. Every Northeastern state except for New Hampshire has voted Democratic six straight elections or more.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party {{nominated}} Stevenson for the United States Congress in 1874. Stevenson was well-liked by Republicans and levied {{influence in}} the local Masonic lodge. Stevenson also received the nomination of the Independent Reform Party, a state party that fought monopolies following the Panic of 1873. Stevenson campaigned against Republican incumbent John McNulta. He attacked McNulta's support for high tariffs and {{what became known as}} the Salary Grab Act, where congressmen increased their salaries by 50%. He spoke little of his own positions other than railroad regulation. McNulta attacked back, accusing Stevenson membership in the Knights of the Golden Circle. Thanks to the votes siphoned away from the <b>Republican</b> <b>Base</b> by the Independent Reform Party, Stevenson won the election with 52% of the vote, though he did not carry his hometown of Bloomington. He was elevated to the 44th United States Congress, the first under Democratic control since the Civil War.|$|E
500|$|As his {{eventual}} entrance neared, Thompson spent {{additional time}} in Iowa {{and announced that}} his campaign strategy would focus on {{the state and its}} nonbinding straw poll held in August. Former Iowa State Representative Steve Grubbs was added as the campaign's consultant for the state. [...] Grubbs had planned to work on the presidential campaign of Senator George Allen, but his usage of an offensive term prevented him from entering the race. Though Thompson was not yet considered a [...] "viable candidate", Grubbs felt that the frontrunners John McCain, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney were unacceptable to the <b>Republican</b> <b>base.</b> He believed that Thompson [...] "had more experience" [...] than any other candidate, and could unify the party.|$|E
5000|$|When the {{legislature}} met in November, it rejected a proposal by Sullivan that popular elections determine the state's electoral slate, and instead chose a Federalist slate supporting Charles Cotesworth Pinckney {{for president in}} a vote boycotted by many <b>Republicans.</b> <b>Based</b> on widespread opinion that the Federalists were likely to lose the presidential election, Sullivan, his health failing, forwarded the electoral votes on to Congress. [...] He died in office on December 10, 1808, aged 64, and was interred in Boston's Granary Burying Ground in a tomb shared by colonial governor Richard Bellingham.|$|R
25|$|The United Mexican States are a {{federation}} whose {{government is}} representative, democratic and <b>republican</b> <b>based</b> on a presidential system {{according to the}} 1917 Constitution. The constitution establishes three levels of government: the federal Union, the state governments and the municipal governments. According to the constitution, all constituent states of the federation must have a republican form of government composed of three branches: the executive, represented by a governor and an appointed cabinet, the legislative branch constituted by a unicameral congress and the judiciary, which will include a state Supreme Court of Justice. They also have their own civil and judicial codes.|$|R

2500|$|Romney's loss {{prompted}} the Republican National Committee {{to try to}} appeal to the American Latino population by concentrating on different approaches to immigration. [...] These were short-lived due to activity and anger from the <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> and {{may have contributed to the}} selection of Donald Trump as their presidential candidate four years later.|$|E
2500|$|The {{airport was}} founded in 1935 as a venture by the Aeroclub de Reus. It served as a <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> during the Spanish Civil War and after the fascist victory served as a Spanish Air Force base. [...] The base was demilitarised in the early 1990s and became a fully {{civilian}} airport administered by AENA, the Spanish airports authority.|$|E
2500|$|Romney's victory {{method was}} {{established}} by performing strongly with the (modest) <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> vote in the state, capturing many independent voters in the belt between Route 128 and [...] I-495, almost running even in smaller working-class cities, and holding down Democratic margins in large urban areas. [...] The conclusion represented the fourth win in a row for Republicans in the state gubernatorial contest.|$|E

50|$|Faced with a war {{situation}} the <b>Republican</b> Army <b>based</b> its {{organization in the}} mixed brigades (brigadas mixtas). Each of these was composed of four battalions. Every battalion included a number of companies. A regular brigada mixta would not exceed 3,000 men.|$|R
25|$|The revolutionary leader Simón Bolívar {{arrived in}} the island of Margarita in May 1816. On 6 May 1816 Bolívar {{declared}} the Third Republic of Venezuela and an Assembly of Notables recognized Simón Bolívar as Supreme Chief in the church of Santa Ana. Bolívar {{then went on to}} the mainland. That year the Republicans were generally successful in their struggle with the Royalist forces. The Spanish general Pablo Morillo returned to Venezuela in December 1816, and decided to first take Margarita, then move on to Guayana Province, both important <b>Republican</b> <b>bases.</b> After some difficulties in collecting supplies and troops, Morillo sailed to Margarita in late June 1817, where he steadily gained control in a hard-fought campaign.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{initially}} {{heralded as}} a victory for Clinton and Democrats in congress, it proved costly. The bill energized the NRA and <b>Republican</b> <b>base,</b> {{and contributed to the}} Republican takeover of both houses in the 1994 mid-term elections. [...] Many Democrats who had supported Clinton's gun control measures were ousted, including Speaker Tom Foley. [...] Clinton acknowledged that he had hurt Democrats with his victories.|$|E
2500|$|McCain {{began the}} {{campaign}} as the apparent frontrunner among Republicans, with {{a strategy of}} appearing as the establishment, inevitable candidate; his campaign website featured an Associated Press article describing him as [...] " [...] political celebrity". He made substantial overtures towards elements of the <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> that had resisted his 2000 insurgency campaign. However, he soon fell behind in polls and fundraising; by July 2007 his campaign was forced to restructure its size and operations. The tide of Republican sentiment against immigration reform legislation he sponsored also led to the erosion of his lead.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} time since 1994, he drew a primary challenger. Republican James Brodbelt Harris, a {{financial}} analyst from Zanesville, Ohio, decided to challenge him in 2006. Harris did not campaign, and collected less than $5,000 in campaign contributions. On May 2, 2006, Ney defeated him 68%–32%. On the day of the election, Greg Giroux of Congressional Quarterly noted: [...] "I'd be surprised if Harris got more than 20 or 25 percent. That would be a sign that there is a chunk of the <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> that's disenchanted with the incumbent." [...] Commenting on his situation after the primary, Ney said [...] "I have a healthy campaign account, in contrast to the Democratic Party, which is deeply divided and has a candidate with almost no campaign cash." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{revolution}} {{began with}} the armed Wuchang Uprising {{and the spread of}} republican insurrection through the southern provinces, and culminated in the abdication of the Xuantong Emperor after lengthy negotiations between rival imperial and <b>republican</b> regimes <b>based</b> in Beijing and Nanjing respectively.|$|R
50|$|Al-Taji airfield, in the {{volatile}} Sunni Triangle, was originally an Iraqi <b>Republican</b> Guard <b>base</b> during the Saddam era. It {{was once a}} center for the manufacture of chemical weapons. Taji was also {{the location of the}} largest tank maintenance facility in Iraq.|$|R

2500|$|Fans of NASCAR are {{generally}} {{considered by the}} media of the United States to fall within the <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> as an [...] "almost exclusively white, conservative racing crowd", the [...] "white, middle-aged, working-class Southern men" [...] who were coveted in {{the first decades of}} 21st century during electoral campaigns. Joe Gibbs, a NASCAR team owner, spoke at the 2008 Republican National Convention. Almost 90 percent of political contributions from those affiliated with NASCAR go to Republican candidates. Texas Governor, Rick Perry sponsored 2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series Champion Bobby Labonte's car for an election campaign in 2010. Labonte was reported to have been paid $225,000 to carry the [...] "rickperry.org" [...] logo. Two years later, Rick Santorum sponsored Tony Raines' car. In 2000, then Republican primary candidate Rudy Giuliani made an appearance at the Daytona International Speedway.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the onset}} of the campaign, Giuliani had held a {{significant}} lead in the nationwide polls by January 2007. [...] His runner up in the polls, Senator John McCain, had his candidacy falter, and throughout 2007, Giuliani maintained his lead in both national polls and fundraising. Political observers predicted that Giuliani's position would fall, either due to <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> voters discovering his liberal positions on certain social issues, his personality, management style or the entrance of former Senator Fred Thompson into the race. Giuliani did not campaign actively in the early voting states, hoping to simply survive in these states, and focused instead on the later, larger states. He campaigned in Florida throughout the primary season, hoping a win in the state's primary on January 29, 2008, would give him enough momentum to win the primaries on Super Tuesday (February 5), where he had also campaigned heavily.|$|E
2500|$|Although Atwater clearly {{approved}} {{of the use of}} the Willie Horton issue, the Bush campaign never ran any commercial with Horton's picture; instead they ran a similar but generic ad. The original commercial was produced by Americans for Bush, an independent group managed by Larry McCarthy, and Republicans benefited from the coverage it attracted in the national media. Referring to Dukakis, Atwater declared that he would [...] "strip the bark off the little bastard" [...] and [...] "make Willie Horton his running mate". Atwater's challenge was to counter the [...] "where was George?" [...] campaign slogan Democrats were using as a rallying cry in an effort to create an impression that Bush was a relatively inexperienced and unaccomplished candidate. Furthermore, Bush had critics in the <b>Republican</b> <b>base,</b> who remembered his pro-choice positions in the 1980 primary, and that the harder the campaign pursued Dukakis's liberal positions, the bigger his base turnout would be.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Individuals' faces {{communicate}} a {{great deal}} of information about them. Although some of this information tends to be perceptually obvious (such as race and sex), much of it is perceptually ambiguous, without clear or obvious visual cues. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we found that individuals' political affiliations could be accurately discerned from their faces. In Study 1, perceivers were able to accurately distinguish whether U. S. Senate candidates were either Democrats or <b>Republicans</b> <b>based</b> on photos of their faces. Study 2 showed that these effects extended to Democrat and <b>Republican</b> college students, <b>based</b> on their senior yearbook photos. Study 3 then showed that these judgments were related to differences in perceived traits among the Democrat and Republican faces. Republicans were perceived as more powerful than Democrats. Moreover, as individual targets were perceived to be more powerful, they were more likely to be perceived as Republicans by others. Similarly, as individual targets were perceived to be warmer, they were more likely to be perceived as Democrats. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data suggest that perceivers' beliefs about who is a Democrat and <b>Republican</b> may be <b>based</b> on perceptions of traits stereotypically associated with the two political parties and that, indeed, the guidance of these stereotypes may lead to categorizations of others' political affiliations at rates significantly more accurate than chance guessing...|$|R
