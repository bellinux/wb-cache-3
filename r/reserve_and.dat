40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this article is}} to present the role of <b>reserves</b> <b>and</b> {{provisions}} in determining the level of profitability of Polish public companies, especially the level of ROE (Return on Equity).

This paper describes three kinds of reserves: reserves as the liability (reserve for income tax, social security <b>reserves</b> <b>and</b> other <b>reserves),</b> accruals <b>and</b> deferred income, <b>and</b> capital <b>reserves,</b> such as reserve capital, revaluation <b>reserve</b> capital <b>and</b> other <b>reserve</b> capital. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} demand for {{international}} <b>reserves</b> (<b>and</b> foreign exchange <b>reserves)</b> during fixed <b>and</b> floating exchange rates periods in three developing countries: Kenya, Mexico and Philippines. Based on theoretical models, three factors are identified as important for the demand of international <b>reserves</b> <b>and</b> foreign reserves: average propensity to import, volume of imports <b>and</b> variability of <b>reserves.</b> The paper employs the cointegration methodology and error correction method to investigate the relationships. Cointegration tests results indicate a reliable long-run stationary relationship between the international <b>reserves</b> (<b>and</b> foreign exchange <b>reserves)</b> <b>and</b> the stated explanatory variables across countries and sub-periods of fixed and clean float. The error correction results indicate causality from the explanatory variables to the reserves during both the short and long run. This is true during both the fixed and the floating period...|$|R
