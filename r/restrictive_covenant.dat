40|$|This article {{addresses}} multiple {{issues surrounding}} {{the use of}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants</b> {{as a basis for}} opposing the construction of cellular towers. Given the current proliferation of cell towers, and the frequent failure of zoning and land use regulations to address such construction in a comprehensive fashion, opponents of such towers often must turn to other options if they wish to avoid placement of towers in their neighborhoods. As a predicate for the discussion of a number of common <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants,</b> and their potential application to cell towers, the article addresses {{the question of whether the}} Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempts reliance on <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants</b> in this context. The article also considers standing to enforce covenants and the potential application of waiver since wireless service providers are likely to locate towers in areas where other towers or similar structures have already been built. The article concludes that federal law should not preempt state law causes of action such as those which might be based on <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants</b> and suggests that <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants</b> may be a useful option for opponents of cell towers...|$|R
25|$|Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, – This was {{recognized}} as a critical case even before it reached the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Earl Warren, realizing how controversial the case {{would be for the}} public, very much wanted to avoid any dissents in the case. But Reed was the lone hold-out. Other members of the Supreme Court worried about Reed's commitment to civil rights, as {{he was a member of}} the (then) all-white Burning Tree Club in Washington, D.C., and his Kentucky home had an all-white <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenant</b> (a covenant which had led Reed to recuse himself from a civil rights case in 1948). Yet, Reed had written the majority decision in Smith v. Allwright and joined the majority in Sweatt v. Painter, , which barred separate but equal racial segregation in law schools. Reed originally planned to write a dissent in Brown, but joined the majority before a decision was issued. Many observers, including Chief Justice Warren, believed a unanimous decision in Brown was necessary to win public acceptance for the decision. Reed was the last holdout and reportedly cried during the reading of the opinion.|$|E

He framed the complex question of the case as: [...] "Can a racially <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenant</b> be enforced at law by a suit for damages against a co-covenantor who allegedly broke the covenant?"

2500|$|Historically the [...] United States of America {{has been}} defined by racially {{segregated}} neighborhoods.

[...] Through the use of the <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenant,</b> and the establishment of zoning laws between World War I and World War II, and the use of urban renewal between the 1940s and 1960s, urban planners have aided in the development of racially segregated neighborhoods.

2500|$|Segregation {{was also}} {{pervasive}} in housing. State constitutions (for example, that of California) had clauses giving local jurisdictions {{the right to}} regulate where members of certain races could live.

In response, whites resorted to the <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenant,</b> a formal deed restriction binding white property owners in a given neighborhood not to sell to blacks. Whites who broke these agreements could be sued by [...] "damaged" [...] neighbors. In the 1948 case of Shelley v. Kraemer, the U.S. Supreme Court finally ruled that such covenants were unenforceable in a court of law. However, residential segregation patterns had already become established in most American cities, and have often persisted up to the present (see white flight and Redlining).|$|E

2500|$|By way of exception, {{alternative}} remedies to {{compensatory damages}} are available {{depending on the}} contract's nature. If damages would be an inadequate remedy, for instance, because the subject matter was a unique painting, {{or a piece of}} land, or was to deliver petrol during an oil crisis, a court may compel literal or specific performance of the contract's terms. It can also compel a defendant to refrain from actions that would continue a breach of contract. Injunctions are discretionary remedies, and so they are not awarded in cases where it might cause hardship, like compelling conveyance of property when it would mean an unexpectedly disabled inhabitant would lose her home. Additionally, the courts have, at least since the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, refused to grant specific performance of contracts involving personal services. This is part of a more general principle that two (potentially hostile) parties to litigation should not be made to work in a long term relationship. In Cooperative Insurance Ltd v Argyll Ltd although a shop broke its contract with a shopping centre to keep its business operating, and actual performance was important to keep flagship businesses and so attract more customers to the centre generally, specific performance was not granted because compelling a potentially loss making business to keep operating was draconian and probably not capable of being policed by the court. No award can be made which punishes, or makes an example of a defendant, even for a cynical and calculated breach of contract. However, in limited situations, a claimant may succeed in a claim for restitution of the contract breaker's gains, as is routinely available in cases involving trustees or other fiduciaries who profit from transactions where they have a conflict of interest. In the leading case, Attorney General v Blake a former secret service agent's profits from book sales, which recounted government information in breach of Blake's employment contract, were stripped. While Lord Nicholls stated, other than compensatory damages are not an adequate remedy, that [...] "no fixed rules can be prescribed" [...] and their Lordships were eager to not hamper the development of the law, the cases where such awards have been made in contract have all involved some quasi-proprietary element. In an earlier case, Wrotham Park Ltd v Parkside Homes Ltd, Brightman J awarded a percentage of gains resulting from building a lot of homes in breach of a <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenant,</b> based on a sum that the parties would have been likely to contract for had they struck a bargain. More recently in Experience Hendrix LLC v PPX Enterprises Inc Mance LJ held that a percentage of profits made by PPX breaching the intellectual property rights on songs by Jimi Hendrix would have to be paid up. So if {{in the course of a}} contract one party is in a position to take advantage of another's rights without their fully informed consent, a restitutionary remedy can be awarded.|$|E
