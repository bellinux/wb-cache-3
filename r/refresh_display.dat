40|$|The Interactive Graphics Finite Element System, IGFES, is {{described}} {{along with its}} supporting analysis software, graphics terminal support package and hardware configurations. IGFES provides an interactive design tool for structural engineers via pre- and postprocessing of finite element data. The system currently runs on an IBM 360 / 44 OS-MFT system or a PDP 11 / 40 DOS/BATCH system. Graphics devices are supported using an inhouse developed, device independent terminal support package. Support is available for the Calcomp 563 drum plotter, Tektronix 4002 A storage display terminal and the Lundy Electronics 20 inch standalone <b>refresh</b> <b>display</b> system. IGFES and its associated systems are written in FORTRAN IV...|$|E

This will only turn on vertical synchronization when the frame {{rate of the}} software exceeds the <b>display's</b> <b>refresh</b> rate, disabling it otherwise.

50|$|A vector-mode display {{directly}} draws {{lines on}} the face of a cathode-ray tube under control of the host computer system. The lines are continuously formed, but since the speed of electronics is limited, the number of concurrent lines that can be displayed at one time is limited. Vector-mode displays were historically important but are no longer used.Practically all modern graphic displays are raster-mode, descended from the picture scanning techniques used for television, in which the visual elements are a rectangular array of pixels. Since the raster image is only perceptible to the human eye as a whole for a very short time, the raster must be refreshed many times per second to give the appearance of a persistent display. The electronic demands of <b>refreshing</b> <b>display</b> memory meant that graphic terminals were developed much later than text terminals, and initially cost much more.|$|R
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "#GetItRight" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who appreciated its overall production. Mariah Eakin from The A.V. Club complimented its placement on Bangerz, describing the song as [...] "perfectly appropriate for an early-twentysomething, albeit {{one who has}} no problem with nudity." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly opined that the track is [...] "every bit as immodest as you'd expect from a young lady who recently spawned a craze for swinging unattired on public pendulums", and further commented that it [...] "solved the riddle [...] what the grinning naked women in Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines' video were thinking". Writing for Slant Magazine, Kyle Fowler appreciated [...] "#GetItRight" [...] for being a [...] "sexy slice of pop-funk whose lyrics boast a raunchy but <b>refreshing</b> <b>display</b> of female sexual agency". Mark Jacobs from V described the track as [...] "a sure Top 40 diamond with a whistling hook and clever sweetness that partially obscures the frank sexual nature of its lyrics." ...|$|R

50|$|The Data Processing {{department}} {{had already been}} experimenting with an IBM 704 computer displaying points on the IBM 780 display which were recorded to 8 mm film. One early use was plotting traffic simulations. However, the displays were not based on storage tubes, so the images disappeared shortly after they were drawn. In {{order to keep the}} image on the screen, the program had to be put into a loop, continually <b>refreshing</b> the <b>display.</b> While this was happening the computer could not be used for other tasks. Although it was suitable for demonstration purposes, a real-world system would need additional hardware to offload this task from the CPU.|$|R
50|$|LCD {{technology}} {{is not usually}} rated by frames per second but rather {{the time it takes}} to transition from one pixel color value to another pixel color value. Normally, a 120 Hz <b>refresh</b> is <b>displayed</b> for a full 1/120 second (8.33 milliseconds) due to sample-and-hold, regardless of how quickly an LCD can complete pixel transitions. Recently, it became possible to hide pixel transitions from being seen, using strobe backlight technology, by turning off the backlight between refreshes, to reduce crosstalk. Newer LCD televisions, including high end Sony and Samsung 3D TVs, now utilize a strobed backlight or scanning backlight to reduce 3D crosstalk during shutter glasses operation.|$|R
50|$|Vector {{displays}} do {{not suffer}} from the display artifacts of aliasing and pixelation (especially, B&W ones; color displays keep some artifacts, due their discrete nature). But they are limited in that they can display only a shape's outline (advanced vector systems can provide {{a limited amount of}} shading). Text is crudely drawn from short strokes. <b>Refresh</b> vector <b>displays</b> are limited in how many lines or how much text can be shown without refresh flicker. Irregular beam motion is slower than steady beam motion of raster displays. Beam deflections are typically driven by magnetic coils, and those coils fight against rapid changes to their current.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>refresh</b> vector <b>displays</b> use {{a normal}} {{phosphor}} that fades rapidly and needs constant refreshing 30-40 times per second {{to show a}} stable image. These displays such as the Imlac PDS-1 require some local refresh memory to hold the vector endpoint data. Other storage tube displays such as the popular Tektronix 4010 use a special phosphor that continues glowing for many minutes. Storage displays do not require any local memory. In the 1970s, both types of vector displays were much more affordable than bitmap raster graphics displays when megapixel computer memory was still very expensive. Today, raster displays have replaced nearly all uses of vector displays.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an inkjet-printed electrochromic(EC) paper display {{integrated}} with passive UHF-RFID tag is introduced {{as a solution}} for passive electronic shelf labels (ESL). To address the system challenges of the limited power budget of passive UHF-RFID tags and the material aging of EC display, a feedback comparator integrated digital displaydriver is proposed based {{on the study of}} electrochromic, bi-stable and aging features of the EC display. Modularized baseband with different enableconditions and clock domains is implemented in the system design level. Moreover, to maintain the system functions when the input power is lower than the <b>display</b> <b>refresh</b> power, a duty-cycled power management unit (PMU) is activated to reduce the load current during energy scavenging and drive the display in short intervals, enabling the fast charging of the voltage rectifier and the correct output of the regulated supply for the core circuit.
