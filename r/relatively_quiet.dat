5|$|Research {{involving}} {{the reaction was}} <b>relatively</b> <b>quiet</b> in subsequent years, until in the mid-1980s when several syntheses employing the Nazarov cyclization were published. Shown below are key steps in the syntheses of Trichodiene and Nor-Sterepolide, the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual alkyne-allene isomerization that generates the divinyl ketone.|$|E

Katniss is assigned to a squad and sent to a <b>relatively</b> <b>quiet</b> sector so that a film crew can shoot propaganda. President Coin sends Peeta along, {{even though he is}} still dangerous and unpredictable. From this, Katniss suspects Coin wants her dead because she has too much influence and has not shown much support for Coin.|$|E

For the era, it offered a <b>relatively</b> <b>quiet,</b> comfortable passenger cabin and showed signs of being a commercial success at its 1952 debut.|$|E
5|$|The loud goose-like honking call is a {{familiar}} sound, particularly during the breeding season; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry {{on for some time}} when perched. The male's call is higher-pitched and more rapid than that of the female.

5|$|All {{historical}} eruptions at Kīlauea {{have occurred}} {{at one of}} three places: its summit caldera, its eastern rift zone, or its southwestern rift zone. Half of Kīlauea's historical eruptions have occurred at or near Kīlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous {{for much of the}} 19th century, capped by a massive explosive eruption in 1924 before petering out by 1934. Recent activity has mostly shifted to Kīlauea's eastern rift zone, the site of 24 historical eruptions, located mostly on its upper section; by contrast, the volcano's southwestern rift zone has been <b>relatively</b> <b>quiet,</b> and has only been the site of five events to date.|$|E

5|$|Although Virginia Tech's {{selection}} via automatic bid was <b>relatively</b> <b>quiet,</b> Kansas' selection {{caused a}} great deal of controversy. Kansas had lost to Big12 runner-up Missouri and had a lower Bowl Championship Poll ranking than the Tigers. Some believed that Missouri should have been selected ahead of Kansas because they had defeated Kansas and because they had played in the Big12 Championship Game. According to BCS officials, however, Missouri's two losses were more of a detriment than Kansas's one loss and subsequent championship game absence.|$|E
5|$|During 6 April, the Ban (governor) of the Drava Banovina, Marko Natlačen {{met with}} representatives of the major Slovene {{political}} parties, and created the National Council of Slovenia, whose aim was to establish a Slovenia independent of Yugoslavia. When he heard the news of fifth column-led revolts within the flanking 4th Army, Trifunović was alarmed, and proposed withdrawal from the border areas, but this was rejected by Petrović. The front along the border with Italy was <b>relatively</b> <b>quiet,</b> with only patrol clashes occurring, some sporadic artillery bombardments of border fortifications, and an unsuccessful raid by the Italians on Mount Blegoš.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August, Colonel David E. Lownds {{took over}} as {{commander}} of the 26th Marine Regiment.

This proved to be the last overland attempt at resupply for Khe Sanh until the following March. During December and early January there were numerous sightings of NVA troops and activities in the Khe Sanh area, but the sector remained <b>relatively</b> <b>quiet.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{process in}} the rock cycle which forms shale is called compaction. The fine {{particles}} that compose shale can remain suspended in water long after the larger particles of sand have deposited. Shales are typically deposited in very slow moving water and are often found in lakes and lagoonal deposits, in river deltas, on floodplains and offshore from beach sands. They can also be deposited in sedimentary basins and on the continental shelf, in <b>relatively</b> deep, <b>quiet</b> water.|$|R
5000|$|The {{train is}} {{equipped}} with LHB coaches. They {{are considered to be}} [...] "anti-telescopic", which means they do not get turned over, if the train derails or gets involved in a collision. These coaches are made of stainless steel and the interiors are made of aluminium which make them lighter as compared to conventional rakes. Each coach also has an [...] "advanced pneumatic disc brake system" [...] for efficient braking at higher speeds, [...] "modular interiors" [...] that integrate lighting into ceiling and luggage racks with wider windows. The improved suspension system of LHB coaches ensures more riding comfort for the passengers compared to conventional rakes. The air conditioning system of the LHB coaches is of higher capacity compared to the older rakes and is controlled by a microprocessor which is said to give passengers better comfort than the older coaches during summer and winter seasons. They are <b>relatively</b> <b>quieter</b> as each coach can produce a maximum noise level of 60 decibels while conventional coaches can produce 100 decibels. Each LHB coach costs between Rs 15 million to 20 million, whereas the power car which houses a generator costs about 30 million.|$|R
5|$|On 14 September, the {{squadron}} began flying missions to escort B-24 Liberator bombers.

The {{first couple of}} missions that {{the squadron}} undertook were <b>relatively</b> <b>quiet</b> but, on 16 September, VMF-214 was attacked {{by a group of}} 35 Japanese A6M Zeros. The squadron repelled the strike, destroying 11 Japanese aircraft for the loss of only one of their own. Several costly engagements with the strong Japanese forces in the area followed. Bolt did not score any victories during this time, but was promoted to first lieutenant that month.|$|E
5|$|Spring {{migration}} is <b>relatively</b> <b>quiet,</b> although sightings of ring ouzel and firecrest are possible amongst {{the more common}} arrivals.

The small grey heron colony has been joined by little egrets, and, from 2010, by Eurasian spoonbills. The pines may occasionally have nesting siskins or common crossbills, and parrot crossbills bred in 1984 and 1985.|$|E
5|$|The life of {{the royal}} family was <b>relatively</b> <b>quiet</b> and withdrawn.

Summers were spent on vacation at Aix-les-Bains in France, visiting relatives in the Russian capital or at Fredensborg and Bernstorff in Denmark, and relaxing at Mon Repos, Corfu.|$|E
5000|$|The first movement, titled Poco animato, {{begins with}} a <b>relatively</b> peaceful, <b>quiet</b> {{introduction}} that slowly develops and becomes increasingly agitated throughout {{the remainder of the}} movement. It is full of violent, stark and almost feral brass outbursts in the midst of suppressed violence. Just as the first movement reaches its climactic point, it collapses into the second movement, a threateningly sinister Scherzo that gradually builds up to a terrifying, volcanic climax which eventually declines into the depths of the orchestra.|$|R

5|$|In the {{subsequent}} battles of Ginchy and Morval, the 1/10th {{was engaged in}} a purely supporting role: trench networks were constructed and improved near Delville Wood, and the dead collected and buried. A party of two officers and 100 other ranks {{was attached to the}} Third West Lancashire Field Ambulance during the Battle of Morval. After bivouacking at Pont Rémy, the battalion transferred with its division to the <b>relatively</b> <b>quiet</b> Ypres Salient in October. The routine of alternating between the front line, being in support, and in reserve preoccupied the battalion until the Third Battle of Ypres in July 1917. Casualties were nevertheless sustained by the battalion during this period, invariably as a result of shelling and sniping.|$|E
50|$|The footballers {{have had}} a <b>relatively</b> a <b>quiet</b> history playing in III and IV level circles, winning their first title of any sort when they claimed the Amateurliga Lower Saxony (IV) {{championship}} in 1961.

In what was formerly Monobe, Kōchi Prefecture (now Kami), someone named Nakao received a takakibi (morokoshi) seed from a yamauba, and by sowing it, a great harvest resulted. At the end of the year, a yamajijii appeared, and it wanted mochi, so it was given a lot of it. The next year also had a great harvest, and even more mochi was given to the yamajijii. In the end {{as a result of this}} repeating many times, the yamajijii became able to eat 3 to (about 54.5 liters) of mochi, and Nakao who feared for his family finances, gave him burned stones which he presented as mochi, and yamajijii who was feeling hot was given hot oil which was presented as tea. The yamajijii was surprised at that and fled back, and died on the way. After that, the Nakao family, who once had abundant crops, declined at once.|$|R
