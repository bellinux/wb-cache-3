40|$|A {{wideband}} spectrometer of 500 MHz {{instantaneous bandwidth}} is described that includes an im-plementation of the Spectral Kurtosis (SK) algorithm for automatic {{radio frequency interference}} (RFI) detection. An SK spectrometer accumulates both power and power-squared, which are then used to develop the SK estimator. The SK spectrometer of the Korean Solar <b>Radio</b> Burst <b>Locator</b> (KSRBL) has a 2 GHz instantaneous bandwidth that is time multiplexed over the 0. 24 - 18 GHz radio frequency range, {{for the study of}} solar bursts. We use a novel presentation of the data from the spectrometers to classify types of RFI. It is found that the algorithm is especially useful for excising highly intermittent RFI but is less successful for RFI due to digital signals.

40|$|The {{operation}} of a <b>radio</b> beacon position <b>locator</b> {{during and after the}} remotely controlled transport aircraft is discussed. The radio beacon transmission was actuated and was picked up by the Navy P- 3 A chase aircraft for a short time, after which reception was lost. The pilot reported that he received a signal on both 121. 5 MHz and 243 MHz for a period of approximately 5 seconds. Five minutes after the crash a portable direction finding unit located {{on the roof of the}} NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility, 4 miles distant from the crash, was unable to pick up the beacon transmission. The fire crews started fighting the fires approximately 90 seconds after the time of impact. Navy personnel access to the crash site was allowed on the morning of December 2, 1984. <b>Radio</b> beacon <b>locator</b> was found resting top side up, 15 feet forward and 13 feet perpendicular from the tray location the starboard side of the aircraft. An immediate inspection indicated the airfoil suffered moderate fire damage with paint peeling but not intumescing. The visual marker strobe lamp housings were intact but extensively burned such that it was impossible to see if the lamps had survived. The airfoil suffered minor structural damage, with assorted dents, etc. The extended plunger on the ARU- 21 release unit indicated that the pyrotechnic deployment system operated. The radio beacon base (tray) suffered some heat and fire damage, and was charred and blackened by smoke. The frangible switch in the nose survived and the switch in the belly was recovered and found to have actuated. It is assumed that this switch fired the ARU- 21 squib. There were no other release switches installed in the normally open system in the aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{communication}} systems rely heavily upon microwave, radio, and other electromagnetic frequency bands {{as a means}} of providing wireless communication links. Although convenient, wireless communication is susceptible to electromagnetic interference. Solar activity causes both direct interference through electromagnetic radiation as well as indirect interference caused by charged particles interacting with Earth's magnetic field. The Solar <b>Radio</b> Burst <b>Locator</b> (SRBL) is a United States Air Force radio telescope designed to detect and locate solar microwave bursts as they occur on the Sun. By analyzing these events, the Air Force hopes {{to gain a better understanding}} of the root causes of solar interference and improve interference forecasts. This thesis presents methods of searching and analyzing events found in the previously unstudied SRBL data archive. A new web-based application aids in the searching and visualization of the data. Comparative analysis is performed amongst data collected by SRBL and several other instruments. This thesis also analyzes events across the time, intensity, and frequency domains. These analysis methods can be used to aid in the detection and understanding of solar events so as to provide improved forecasts of solar-induced electromagnetic interference...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{report on}} the design and {{construction}} of a wideband spectrometer of 500 MHz instantaneous bandwidth that includes automatic radio frequency interference (RFI) detection. The implementation is based on hardware developed at the Center for Astronomical Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER). The unique aspect of the spectrometer is that it accumulates both power and power-squared, which are then used to develop a spectral kurtosis (SK) estimator. The SK estimator statistics are used for real-time detection and excision of certain types of RFI embedded in the received signal. We {{report on the}} use of this spectrometer in the Korean Solar <b>Radio</b> Burst <b>Locator</b> (KSRBL). This instrument utilizes four of these 500 MHz bandwidth SK spectrometers in parallel, to achieve a 2 GHz instantaneous bandwidth that is time multiplexed over the entire 0. 24 â€“ 18 GHz radio frequency range, to study solar bursts. The performance of the spectrometers for excising RFI over this range is presented. It is found that the algorithm is especially useful for excising highly intermittent RFI but is less successful for RFI due to digital signals. A method we call multiscale SK is presented that addresses the known blindness of Kurtosis-based estimators to 50 % duty-cycle RFI. The SK algorithm can also be applied to spectral channels prior to correlation to remove unwanted RFI from interferometer data...|$|R
50|$|The NTSB {{has asked}} for the {{installation}} of cockpit image recorders in large transport aircraft to provide information that would supplement existing CVR and FDR data in accident investigations. They have recommended that image recorders be placed into smaller aircraft that {{are not required to}} have a CVR or FDR. The rationale is that what is seen on an instrument by the pilots of an aircraft is not necessarily the same as the data sent to the display device. This is particularly true of aircraft equipped with electronic displays (CRT or LCD). A mechanical instrument is likely to preserve its last indication, {{but this is not the}} case with an electronic display. Such systems, estimated to cost less than $8,000 installed, typically consist of a camera and microphone located in the cockpit to continuously record cockpit instrumentation, the outside viewing area, engine sounds, radio communications, and ambient cockpit sounds. As with conventional CVRs and FDRs, data from such a system is stored in a crash-protected unit to ensure survivability. Since the recorders can sometimes be crushed into unreadable pieces, or even located in deep water, some modern units are self-ejecting (taking advantage of kinetic energy at impact to separate themselves from the aircraft) and also equipped with <b>radio</b> emergency <b>locator</b> transmitters and sonar underwater locator beacons to aid in their location.|$|R
40|$|The Solar <b>Radio</b> Burst <b>Locator</b> (SRBL) is a {{spectrometer}} {{that can}} observe solar microwave bursts {{over a wide}} band (0. 1 â€“ 18 GHz) as well as detect the burst locations without interferometry or mechanical scanning. Its prototype has been operated at Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) since 1998. In this study, we have evaluated the capability of the SRBL system in flux and radio burst location measurements. For this, we consider 130 microwave bursts from 2000 to 2002. The SRBL radio fluxes of 53 events were compared with the fluxes from USAF/RSTN and the burst locations of 25 events were compared with the optical flare locations. From this study, we found: (1) there is a relatively good correlation (r = 0. 9) between SRBL flux and RSTN flux; (2) the mean location error is about 8. 4 arcmin and the location error (4. 7 arcmin) of single source events is much smaller than that (14. 9 arcmin) of multiple source events; (3) the minimum location error usually occurred just after the starting time of burst, mostly within 10 seconds; (4) there is a possible anti-correlation (r = âˆ’ 0. 4) between the pointing error of SRBL antenna and the location error. The anti-correlation becomes more evident (r = âˆ’ 0. 9) for 6 strong single source events associated with X-class flares. Our {{results show that the}} flux measurement of SRBL is consistent with that of RSTN, and the mean location error of SRBL is estimated to be about 5 arcmin for single source events...|$|R
40|$|We found {{systematic}} microwave source motions along a flare-arcade using Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) 17 GHz images. The motions {{were associated}} with a X-class disk flare which occurred on 15 th February 2011. For this study, we also used EUV images from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and magnetograms from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory, and multi-channel microwave data from Nobeyama Radiopolarimeters (NoRP) and Korean Solar <b>Radio</b> Burst <b>Locator</b> (KSRBL). We traced centroids of the microwave source observed by NoRH 17 GHz during the flare and found two episodes of the motion with several facts: 1) The microwave source moved systematically along the flare-arcade, which was observed by the AIA 94 A in a direction parallel to the neutral line. 2) The period of each episode was 5 min and 14 min, respectively. 3) Estimated parallel speed was 34 km/s for the first episode and 22 km/s for the second episode. The spectral slope of microwave flux above 10 GHz obtained by NoRP and KSRBL was negative for both episodes, {{and for the last}} phase of the second episodes, it was flat with the flux of 150 sfu. The negative spectrum and the flat with high flux indicate that the gyrosynchrotron emission from accelerated electrons was dominant during the source motions. The sequential images from the AIA 304 A and 94 A channels revealed that there were successive plasma eruptions and each eruption was initiated just before the start time of the microwave sources motion. Based on the results, we suggest that the microwave source motion manifests the displacement of the particle acceleration site caused by plasma eruptions. Comment: 14 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
