Local (at a given latitude) spectra are similar to the X-ray burst spectra and are described by a diluted black body.

They depend slightly on the inclination angle and on the luminosity. These spectra also can be fitted by a diluted black body with the color temperature depending mainly on a neutron star compactness. Owing to the fact that the flux from {{the spreading}} layer is close to the critical Eddington, we can put constraints on a neutron star radius without the need to know precisely the emitting region area or the distance to the source. The boundary layer spectra observed in the luminous low-mass X-ray binaries, and described by a black body of color temperature Tc= 2. 4 +- 0. 1 keV, restrict the neutron star radii to R= 14. 8 +- 1. 5 km (for a 1. 4 -Msun star and solar composition of the accreting matter), which corresponds to the hard equation of state.

40|$|Context. The close-in planet {{orbiting}} GJ 436 {{presents a}} puzzling orbital eccentricity (e ' 0. 14) considering its very short orbital period. Given {{the age of}} the system, this planet should have been tidally circularized a long time ago. Many attempts to explain this were proposed in recent years, either involving abnormally weak tides, or the perturbing action of a distant companion. Aims. In this paper, we address the latter issue based on Kozai migration. We propose that GJ 436 b was formerly located further away from the star and that it underwent a migration induced by a massive, inclined perturber via Kozai mechanism. In this context, the perturbations by the companion trigger high amplitude variations to GJ 436 b that cause tides to act at periastron. Then the orbit tidally shrinks to reach its present day location. Methods. We numerically integrate the 3 -body system including tides and General <b>Relativity</b> <b>correction.</b> We use a modified symplec-tic integrator as well a fully averaged integrator.

Conversely, starting from 5 - 10 times further away allows the onset of Kozai cycles. The tides act in peak eccentricity phases and reduce the semi-major axis of the planet.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThis thesis {{utilizes}} the Lorentz transformation formulas {{from the}} special theory of relativity {{in dealing with the}} law of reflection from a moving mirror. It was found necessary in the proof to consider the source of the light ray and its final destination. For this reason the mirror was taken to be one side of a square. The light source was at one corner of {{the opposite side of the}} square and the light ray was so directed that it would be reflected to the other corner. For a physical treatment of the problem a cubical box would be necessary, but for the mathematical treatment the square was sufficient. In the first part of the thesis the square was moving away from the earth at a fixed angle and a constant velocity. The earth was considered to be the stationary system. If an observer was placed on the square he would note that the light would be reflected to the corner of the square. The problem was to investigate the effect of the <b>relativity</b> <b>correction</b> on the law of reflection from a moving mirror and as a subsidiary problem the effect of a moving or stationary ether upon reflection from a mirror at rest. A medium, called the ether, for the light to pass through was brought into the problem. It was assumed stationary with respect to the earth. The first formula derived was the law of reflection from a moving mirror using the methods of classical physics. This law was general in that it did not involve the source of light. It dealt entirely with the angles of incidence and reflection, and the velocity of the mirror with respect to the earth. Next, a classical treatment of the moving square was made. This was treated as a geometrical problem. It was assumed for this case and the next that the quantities that could be measured physically were the velocity of the square, the angle at which it was moving, and the angle of incidence from the point of view of an observer on the mirror. It was assumed in the construction that the reflected ray would hit the corner of the square. Thus the formula for the angle of reflection was derived. For this angle to be correct it would have to agree with the angle given by the law of reflection from a moving mirror. To show that the two angles were not identical a numerical example was worked out. The angles were widely divergent. Then the Lorentz transformation formulas were applied. Actually, the only formula needed was the one which showed how much a length would apparently be shortened in its direction of motion. This shortening is from the stationary observer's point of view. The effect of this apparent shortening was to alter the angles in the geometric construction. The equations for the angles of incidence and reflection were then formulated in terms of the quantities assumed to be known. This angle of reflection to be correct must agree with the angle from the law of reflection from a moving mirror for the same angle of incidence. The <b>relativity</b> <b>correction</b> was applied to the law of reflection. It was assumed that the two angles of reflection were identically equal. It was then proven that this assumption was correct. It should be noted that the normal that the stationary observer uses for calculating the angles of incidence and reflection is the normal from his point of view and not that of the observer on the square. The stationary ether had no effect upon the outcome of the problem. In the second part of the thesis the square was considered to be stationary and the ether moving with a constant velocity. The problem was to find out what effect this moving ether has upon the light being reflected to the corner of the square. This problem was divided into two cases which were assumed to be independent. They were (1) the effect of the ether upon the light and (2) the effect of the ether upon the mirror. In the first case the ether can change the velocity and the direction of the light ray. By taking a particular orientation of the square it was shown that if a transformation was applied that would lead to the correct results the velocity of the ether would have to reduce to zero. However, this gives a result that the observer has already obtained without considering a moving ether and transformations. In the second case the ether can distort the square. To get the correct results the transformation would have to bring it back to a square. Again the velocity of the ether would have to reduce to zero. The observer would have measured his apparatus as a square without taking into account any distortions. Thus in both cases a moving ether is artificial and meaningless. Therefore in both parts of the problem the ether whether moving or stationary adds nothing to the solution. It is well known that light reflects from a mirror in a square according to the formula i = r and the light is reflected to the corner of the square if the mirror is at rest relative to an observer. If this is true then light reflected from a mirror in a square in motion relative to an observer should lead the observer from his calculations to predict that the light will be reflected to the corner of the square. This paper shows that it is necessary to apply the <b>relativity</b> <b>correction</b> to the law of reflection from a moving mirror to have theory agree with facts...|$|E

The timescale of this process appears in most cases much longer than the standard circularization time of the planet by a factor larger than 50. This model can provide a solution to the eccentricity paradox of GJ 436 b. Depending on the various orbital configurations, it can take several Gyrs to GJ 436 b to achieve a full orbital decrease and circularization. According to this scenario, we could be witnessing today {{the second phase of the}} scenario where the semi-major axis is already reduced while the eccentricity is still significant. We then explore the parameter space and derive in which conditions this model can be realistic given {{the age of the}} system.

Appreciating a detailed theoretical and observational study of relativistic binary pulsar systems, especially the system of Hulse and Taylor, we conclude that general relativity and astrophysical observations rule out the existence of gravitational radiation. Thus, {{the force of gravity}} is not a local gauge force. The discovery of the binary pulsar B 1913 + 16 by Hulse and Taylor [1] represents a milestone in astrophysics because relativistic binary pulsar systems are perfect laboratories to study general relativity.

We then evaluate the location of all Lagrangian points in the Earth-Moon system within the framework of general relativity. For the points L 4 and L 5, the corrections of coordinates are of order a few millimeters. After that, we set up a scheme where the theory which is quantum corrected has as its classical counterpart the Einstein theory, instead of the Newtonian one. By virtue of the effective-gravity correction to the longdistance form of the potential among two point masses, all terms involving the ratio between the gravitational radius of the primary and its separation from the planetoid get modified.

Both objects {{are assumed to be}} deformed due to their own rotations, as well as due to the mutual tidal interactions. The general <b>relativity</b> <b>corrections</b> are considered in terms of the post-Newtonian approximation. Besides the conservative contributions to the perturbing forces, there are also taken into account non-conservative effects, i. e., the dissipation of the mechanical energy. This dissipation {{is a result of the}} tidal perturbation on the velocity field in the internal zones with non-zero turbulent viscosity (convective zones). Our main goal is to derive the equations of the orbital motion as well as the equations governing time-evolution of the spin vectors (angular velocities). We derive the Lagrangian equations of the second kind for systems which do not conserve the mechanical energy. Next, the equations of motion are averaged out over all fast angles with respect to time-scales characteristic for conservative perturbations. The final equations of motion are then used to study the dynamics of the non-conservative model over time scales of the order of the age of the star. We analyze the final state of the system as a function of the initial conditions. Equilibria states of the averaged system are finally discussed.

We focus on hierarchical planetary systems. A survey regarding model parameters (the masses, semi-major axes, spin rate of the star) reveals a rich and non-trivial dynamics of the secular system. Our study is focused on its equilibria. Such solutions predicted by the classic secular theory, which correspond to aligned (mode I) or anti-aligned (mode II) apsides, may be strongly affected by the gravitational corrections. The so called true secular resonance, which is a new feature of the classic two-planet problem discovered by Michtchenko & Malhotra (2004), may appear in other, {{different regions of the}} phase space of the generalized model. We found bifurcations of mode II which emerge new, yet unknown in the literature, secularly unstable equilibria and a complex structure of the phase space.

These formulas then reduce to the standard definitions of Newtonian kinetic energy and momentum. This is as it should be, for special relativity must agree with Newtonian mechanics at low velocities. Computer modeling has to be as real as possible. Classical physics would introduce an error as in the superfluidity case. In order to produce reliable models of the world, we can not use classic physics. It is true that quantum theories consume time and computer resources, and the equations of classical physics could be resorted to provide a quick solution, but such a solution would lack reliability.|$|R

The modified system is gauge invariant under the PoincarÃ© group enlarged by an Abelian ideal. Although the resulting action naively looks like general <b>relativity</b> plus <b>corrections</b> due to matter sources, it is shown that the non-minimal couplings produce a radical departure from GR. Indeed, the dynamics is not continuously connected to the one obtained from EinsteinâHilbert action. In a matter-free configuration and in the torsionless sector, the field equations are too strong a restriction on the geometry as the metric must satisfy both the Einstein and pure GaussâBonnet equations. In particular, the five-dimensional Schwarzschild geometry fails to be a solution; however, configurations corresponding to a brane-world with positive cosmological constant on the worldsheet are admissible when one of the matter fields is switched on. These results can be extended to higher odd dimensions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the concept of {{simultaneity}} in classical and relativistic physics as construed in terms of group-invariant equivalence relations. A full examination of Newton, Galilei and PoincarÃ© invariant equivalence relations in ^ 4 is presented, which provides alternative proofs, additions and occasionally corrections of results in the literature, including Malament's theorem and some of its variants. It is argued that the interpretation of simultaneity as an invariant equivalence relation, although interesting for its own sake, does not cut in the debate concerning the conventionality of simultaneity in special <b>relativity.</b> Comment: Some <b>corrections,</b> mostly of misprints.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a general approximation scheme {{in order to}} calculate gauge invariant observables in the canonical formulation of general relativity. Using this scheme we will show how the observables and the dynamics of field theories on a fixed background or equivalently the observables of the linearized theory {{can be understood as}} an approximation to the observables in full general <b>relativity.</b> Gauge invariant <b>corrections</b> can be calculated up to an arbitrary high order and we will explicitly calculate the first non [...] trivial correction. Furthermore we will make a first investigation into the Poisson algebra between observables corresponding to fields at different space [...] time points and consider the locality properties of the observables.
