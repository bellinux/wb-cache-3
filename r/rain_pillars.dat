50|$|One iron {{pillar of}} about 40 feet length is planted erect {{in front of}} Moola Mookambika Temple near peak of Kodachadri and it is {{compared}} with massive similar historic iron pillars located at Dhar, Mount Abu etc. Devotees {{believe that this is}} the trishula used by goddess Mookambika to slay a demon called Mookasura as per local tradition. Indian scientists from IGCAR Kalpakkam and KREC(Now NITK), Suratkal, Mangalore conducted a test on the Iron pillar and found that it was made from traditional Indian metallurgical skills and not from modern casting methods. It is found made of pure iron. It is also found to be less affected by corrosion, despite of humid conditions prevailing there due to heavy <b>rains.</b> This iron <b>pillar</b> is considered as testimony of ancient Indian iron craftmanship.|$|R
