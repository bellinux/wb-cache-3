5|$|After {{competing}} in a bat'leth tournament {{on the planet}} Forcas III, Lieutenant Worf returns to the Enterprise and is treated to a surprise birthday party, much to his annoyance. As he attends the party, he starts to notice subtle changes, such as {{the flavor of the}} cake changing, and a painting given to him by Data appearing on a different wall. The changes start to become more pronounced; as a Cardassian vessel attacks the Enterprise, unfamiliar controls result in Worf failing to raise the shields, leading to the death of Geordi La Forge. Despite retaining his initial memories, Worf has no evidence that <b>reality</b> <b>has</b> changed, and his own personal logs support the stories given by the other crew members. Other major changes occur: Riker is Captain of the Enterprise in a reality wherein Picard was killed by the Borg, the Bajorans became the oppressors of the Cardassians and enemies of the Federation, Wesley Crusher is a lieutenant on the Enterprise, Alyssa Ogawa is the Chief Medical Officer, and Worf finds himself married to Deanna Troi.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to dualism, monism {{does not accept}} any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally disparate nature of <b>reality</b> <b>has</b> been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia. In Indian and Chinese philosophy, monism is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are physicalist. Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science. However, a variety of formulations (see below) are possible. Another form of monism, idealism, states that the only existing substance is mental. Although pure idealism, {{such as that of}} George Berkeley, is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called panpsychism, according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and David Ray Griffin.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of Titanics wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at 12,000 feet down would preserve the ship virtually intact. The water is bitterly cold at only about , there is no light and the high pressure was thought to be likely to lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms {{would not be able to}} gain a foothold on the wreck. Titanic would effectively be in a deep freeze. The <b>reality</b> <b>has</b> turned out to be very different, and the ship has increasingly deteriorated since she sank in April 1912. Her gradual decay is due to a number of different processes– physical, chemical and biological. She is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in Titanic Canyon which is swept by the Western Boundary Current. Eddies from the current flow constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull. The current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ship's hull. Salt corrosion eats away at the hull and it is also affected by galvanic corrosion.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Jain {{references}} to this parable {{are found in}} Tattvarthaslokavatika of Vidyanandi (9th century) and it appears twice in the Syādvādamanjari of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). According to Mallisena, whenever anyone takes a partial, unconditional view of the ultimate reality, and denies the possibility of another aspect of that reality, it is an instance of the above parable and a defective view. Mallisena goes further in his second reference to the above parable and states that all <b>reality</b> <b>has</b> infinite aspects and attributes, all assertions can only be relatively true. This does not mean scepticism or doubt is the right path to knowledge, according to Mallisena and other Jain scholars, but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally, partially true. Any and all viewpoints, states Mallisena, that do not admit an exception are false views.|$|E
25|$|Assuming {{counterfactual}} definiteness, <b>reality</b> <b>has</b> been enlarged, {{and there}} is a non-locality problem. On the other hand, in the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, reality consists only of a deterministically evolving wave function and non-locality is a non-issue.|$|E

25|$|On {{the cutting}} edge of what many are calling the new media {{revolution}} of form and content, or in other words of the mediation of experience, Bolter and Grusin provide an important insight into the interdependency of media and its integral role in understanding how “the remediation of <b>reality</b> <b>has</b> been built into our technologies of representation” (p.62).|$|E
25|$|Virtual reality {{can be used}} to {{simulate}} the original conditions of a traumatic event for use in exposure therapy. This is particularly useful when patients believe the memories of their experience are too strong for them to actively search for and retrieve. Virtual <b>reality</b> <b>has</b> been used to treat individuals with PTSD symptoms stemming from the terrorist attacks of 9/11.|$|E
25|$|The romantic idea of {{enlightenment}} as insight into a timeless, transcendent <b>reality</b> <b>has</b> been popularized especially by D.T. Suzuki. Further popularization {{was due to}} the writings of Heinrich Dumoulin. Dumoulin viewed metaphysics as the expression of a transcendent truth, which according to him was expressed by Mahayana Buddhism, but not by the pragmatic analysis of the oldest Buddhism, which emphasizes anatta. This romantic vision is also recognizable in the works of Ken Wilber.|$|E

25|$|Blade Runner {{depicts a}} future whose fictional {{distance}} from present <b>reality</b> <b>has</b> grown sharply smaller as 2020 approaches. The film delves {{into the future}} implications of technology {{on the environment and}} society by reaching into the past using literature, religious symbolism, classical dramatic themes and film noir. This tension between past, present and future is apparent in the retrofitted future of Blade Runner, which is high-tech and gleaming in places but elsewhere decayed and old.|$|E
25|$|Virtual <b>reality</b> <b>has</b> {{been shown}} to improve the social skills of young adults with autism. In one study, {{participants}} controlled a virtual avatar in different virtual environments and maneuvered through various social tasks such as interviewing, meeting new people, and dealing with arguments. Researchers found that participants improved {{in the areas of}} emotional recognition in voices and faces and in considering the thoughts of other people. Participants were also surveyed months after the study for how effective they thought the treatments were, and the responses were overwhelmingly positive. Many other studies have also explored this occupational therapy option.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} is {{further complicated by}} the fact that the physicians staffing the SMUR units are among the lowest-paid in Europe. Although salaries have recently improved somewhat, in 2002 it was reported that these physicians who are, for the most part, full-time employees of public hospitals, had a starting salary of only €1300 (£833; $1278) per month. This economic <b>reality</b> <b>has</b> resulted in understandably high turnover and some difficulty in staffing positions. It has been suggested, however, that the recognition of emergency medicine as an in-hospital specialty in France and elsewhere in Europe is likely to result in the evolution of that system towards more comprehensive in-hospital emergency services.|$|E

500|$|Wieman's words proved prophetic. [...] Though Process and <b>Reality</b> <b>has</b> {{been called}} [...] "arguably the most {{impressive}} single metaphysical text of the twentieth century," [...] it has been little-read and little-understood, partly because it demands – as Isabelle Stengers puts it – [...] "that its readers accept the adventure {{of the questions that}} will separate them from every consensus." [...] Whitehead questioned western philosophy's most dearly held assumptions about how the universe works, but in doing so he managed to anticipate a number of 21st century scientific and philosophical problems and provide novel solutions.|$|E

[...] After winning the pennant, the Giants lost to the Yankees in the World Series four games to two. The Brooklyn Dodgers rebounded to win the National League pennant in 1952, but lost the 1952 World Series to the Yankees four games to three.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book Deep Space and Sacred Time: Star Trek in the American Mythos state that the episode [...] "Deadlock," [...] which {{featured}} the death of Kim, {{was one of several}} examples in the Star Trek franchise where the death of a major character is reversed by a parallel existence. Other examples included in The Next Generation with the return of Tasha Yar in [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] and the death of Miles O'Brien in the Deep Space Nine episode [...] "". They felt that Kim also shared another similarity with [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] in that in the episode [...] "Non Sequitur", he feels that <b>reality</b> <b>has</b> been changed – which was similar to the experience that Guinan felt in The Next Generation episode.|$|E

500|$|The {{starship}} [...] {{encounters a}} rift in spacetime {{while on a}} routine mission. As they monitor the anomaly, the heavily damaged USS Enterprise-C, a ship {{believed to have been}} destroyed more than two decades earlier, emerges. Instantly, the Enterprise-D undergoes a sudden and radical change from its current timeline: it is now a warship, and the United Federation of Planets is at war with the Klingons. Neither Worf nor Counselor Troi are seen or referred to, and Tasha Yar– who was killed years before– is now running the tactical station. None of the crew notice the change, but [...] senses that <b>reality</b> <b>has</b> shifted, and has a meeting with Captain Picard to discuss her concerns. She senses that there are supposed to be children on the ship, which of course is completely impractical on a warship. She suggests that the Enterprise-C does not belong in their time and must return to the past. Picard, who knows {{that this would be a}} suicide mission, refuses to give such an order on Guinan's intuition alone.|$|E
2500|$|Eli Siegel (August 16, 1902 – November 8, 1978) was the poet, critic, and {{educator}} {{who founded}} Aesthetic Realism, {{the philosophy that}} sees reality as the aesthetic oneness of opposites.
