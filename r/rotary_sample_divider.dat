30|$|Sixty {{samples were}} {{processed}} for coccolith analysis (at ~[*] 3  m intervals). Sediment samples were freeze-dried and prepared following combined dilution and filtering (Andruleit 1996), which enabled {{estimates of the}} absolute numbers of coccoliths per gram of dry sediment. Between 61 and 129  mg of dry bulk sediment was suspended in buffered water and treated ultrasonically for ~[*] 30  s. Samples were wet-split using a <b>rotary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>divider,</b> and 1 / 100 of the original solution was filtered through polycarbonate filters (0.45  μm pore size) with a vacuum pump.

Following a counting routine, a minimum of 400 coccoliths per sample were identified and classified under SEM at ×[*] 3000 magnification. However, in a few cases, this minimum number was not reached. Identification of coccoliths followed Young et al.

40|$|The {{filtration}} {{technique is}} a widely applied method to calculate absolute coccolith abundances in paleoceanographic, paleoclimatic and ecological studies. Here, we have tested the accuracy and reproducibility of absolute coccolith abundance estimates obtained with the filtration method in combination with a <b>rotary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>divider.</b> The examination of two different filtration devices, a funnel and an in-line system, analysing a known number of microbeads per weight, revealed that counts obtained with funnel systems are up to Ø 18. 6 % too high. Repeated analyses (15 ×) of a fine-fraction sediment sample revealed {{a standard deviation of}} ± 11. 4 % for the in-line system and ± 15. 2 % for the funnel system, respectively. The comparison between three sub-samples (three splits of 1 / 30) showed a standard deviation of 4. 6 % for the in-line system and 9. 9 % for the funnel system, respectively. Therefore, we assume that the potential split error for the rotary splitter is ? 4. 6 %. The comparison of our results with estimates for the same samples analysed with the random settling and the “spiking with microbeads and spraying method” (SMS method) reveal that only the data obtained with the SMS and in-line filter method are statistically equal. The results obtained with the settling method are too low, whilst the results obtained with funnel filtration are too high in terms of coccolith absolute abundances. Our results confirm that the filtration method, including sample splitting with a rotary splitter, is a suitable method for the analysis of absolute coccolith abundances. However, the use of different filtration devices appears to affect the accuracy and reproducibility of the results. Furthermore, the number of splitting steps should be as small as possible to avoid an increase of error due to error propagation. In order to increase the reliability of the filtration method, we suggest calibrating a filtration device with microbeads as a standard measure. The reported reproducibility of the various preparation techniques may help to compare data sets obtained with different methods. <br/...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a novel unequal {{broadband}} out-of-phase {{power divider}} (PD) is presented. Double-sided parallel-strip lines (DSPSLs) are employed {{to achieve an}} out-of-phase response. Also, an asymmetric dual-band matching structure with two external isolation resistors is utilized to obtain arbitrary unequal power division, in which the resistors are directly grounded for heat sinking. A through ground via (TGV), connecting {{the top and bottom}} sides of the DSPSLs, is used to short the isolation components. Additionally, this property can efficiently improve the broadband matching and isolation bandwidths. To investigate the proposed divider in detail, a set of design equations are derived based on the circuit theory and transmission line theory. The theoretical analysis shows that broadband responses can be obtained as proper frequency ratios are adopted. To verify the proposed concept, a <b>sample</b> <b>divider</b> with a power division of 2 : 1 is demonstrated.

The Operating Envelop defines the maximum downward force, maximum rotational speed and minimum purge gas flow allowed during operation of the RMCSS. The original values of 1170 lb. down force, 55 RPM rotational speed, and 30 SCFM nitrogen purge gas were determined during original envelope testing. This envelope was determined by observing the temperature rise on the bitface while drilling into waste simulants. The maximum temperature in single-shell tanks (SSTS) is considered to be approximately 9 O C and the critical drill bit temperature, which is the temperature at which an exothermic reaction could be initiated in the tank waste, was previously determined to be 150 C. Thus, the drill bit temperature increase was limited to 60 C. Thermal properties of these simulants approximated typical properties of waste tank saltcake. Later, more detailed envelope testing which used a pumice block simulant, showed a notably higher temperature rise while drilling. This pumice material, which simulated a ``worst case`` foreign object embedded in the waste, has lower thermal conductivity and lower thermal diffusivity than earlier simulants. These properties caused a slower heat transfer in the pumice than in the previous simulants and consequently a higher temperature rise. The maximum downward force was subsequently reduced to 750 lb (at a maximum 55 RPM and minimum 30 SCFM purge gas flow) which was the maximum value at which the drill bit could be operated and still remain below the 60 C temperature rise...|$|R

40|$|Quality of {{oat flakes}} is {{dependent}} on end-use. Specific weight is used to steer the flaking process, and is important in ensuring that the correct pack weight is achieved. It is also related to flake thickness. Flake thickness in turn may affect other quality parameters such as water absorption, colour and breakage of the flakes. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the effect of specific weight on the quality parameters of oat flakes. Oat flakes were prepared from locally grown oats by a commercial mill. Five flake thickness levels were obtained by adjusting the gap between the rolls. According to usual practice, specific weight was used as an indicator of thickness. For determination of moisture content and pasting properties, samples were ground using a pin mill and cyclone mill. Thickness was measured from 10 randomly selected flakes. Moisture content was determined by air-drying. Water absorption was determined by weighing 50 g of flakes into a beaker and adding 200 ml of water at 24 °C. After 5 min the mixture was spread over a pre-weighed 0. 85 mm screen, tilted at 28 ° from the horizontal and allowed to drain. Flake colour was measured with a tri-stimulus instrument. Flake size distribution was measured using 5 and 2. 5 mm round-holed sieves, from a representative sample obtained with a <b>sample</b> <b>divider.</b> Pasting properties were measured using a Rapid Viscoanalyzer. There was a positive correlation between specific weight and flake thickness. Specific weight showed strong negative correlations with water absorption and the peak viscosity of flakes ground in a pin mill, however there were no significant difference between finely ground flakes, which suggests differences in the particle size distribution or extractability of starch. Thin flakes were whiter. The relationship between specific weight and breakage was less clear, although thin flakes were more susceptible to breakage. These results suggest some methods for measuring the quality of oat flakes and show the effect of a milling parameter (specific weight) on these quality parameters. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R

Moreover, the specific feature, micro-channels of the porous tips, allows efficient sample loading and facilitates electrospray ionization (ESI), which is beneficial for the direct sample analysis. Systematic study on the influences of the physical and chemical factors of various porous materials (polyester, polyethylene and wood) on the detection sensitivity and ionization efficiency was firstly investigated. It was found that the chemical interaction between the porous materials and analytes could significantly affect the detection sensitivity for analytes. Hydrophobic spraying tips showed better detection sensitivity for polar analytes while better detection for non-polar analytes was obtained when hydrophilic spraying tip was used. Moreover, the electrostatic properties of spraying tips could also affect the detection sensitivity for analytes. Hydrophobic materials (i. e., polyethylene and polyester) which tend to form negative charge on the surface could facilitate the ionization of analytes in negative ion mode. With a clear understanding of the effect of porous spraying materials on detection sensitivity, tip spray ionization mass spectrometric method was developed and successfully applied to direct analysis of pharmaceutical, forensic, clinical and food <b>samples.</b> <b>Rotary</b> <b>sample</b> stages compatible to the ion source of two commercial mass spectrometers were designed and constructed for the automation of tip spray ionization mass spectrometry, which allowed the analysis of 12 samples in less than 15 minutes.
