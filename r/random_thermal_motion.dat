Although some artificial molecular machines have been synthesized 2 - 4 and used collectively to perform mechanical tasks 5 - 7, so far {{there have been no}} direct measurements of mechanical processes at the single-molecule level. Here we report measurements of the mechanical work performed by a synthetic molecule less than 5 nm long. We show that biased Brownian motion of the sub-molecular components in a hydrogen-bonded [2]rotaxane 8 -a molecular ring threaded onto a molecular axle-can be harnessed to generate significant directional forces. We used the cantilever of an atomic force microscope to apply a mechanical load to the ring during single-molecule pulling-relaxing cycles. The ring was pulled along the axle, away from the thermodynamically favoured binding site, and was then found to travel back to this site against an external load of 30 pN. Using fluctuation theorems, we were able to relate measurements of the work done at the level of individual rotaxane molecules to the free-energy change as previously determined from ensemble measurements. The results show that individual rotaxanes can generate directional forces of similar magnitude to those generated by natural molecular machines...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the properties of}} quantum radiation produced by a uniformly accelerating charged particle undergoing <b>thermal</b> <b>random</b> <b>motions,</b> which originates from the coupling to the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Because the <b>thermal</b> <b>random</b> <b>motions</b> are regarded to result from the Unruh effect, this quantum radiation is termed Unruh radiation. The energy flux of Unruh radiation is negative and smaller than that of Larmor radiation by one order in a/m, where a is the constant acceleration and m is {{the mass of the}} particle. Thus, the Unruh radiation appears to be a suppression of the classical Larmor radiation. The quantum interference effect {{plays an important role in}} this unique signature. The results is consistent with the predictions of a model consisting of a particle coupled to a massless scalar field as well as those of the previous studies on the quantum effect on the Larmor radiation.

40|$|The {{ionosphere}} {{is considered}} as a dissipative medium in which the <b>random</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>motions</b> of the charged particles act {{as a source of}} thermal radiation. Attention has been focused on the electrons colliding with ions and neutral particles in the ionosphere. A method of analysis has been developed with the aid of the Maxwell and Langevin equations based on a linear, macroscopic, fluctuating electromagnetic field theory. The spectral density of the randomcurrent source function is derived in terms of the conductivity tensor of the ionosphere. The ionosphere is divided into a large number of incremental volume elements, each containing an ionized medium which represents an anisotropic elementary radiating system, characterized by the spectral density of the source function. The radiation characteristic of the radiating system observed at a point located outside of the source region is obtained with the aid of the potential functions which relate the thermal electromagnetic fields at the observation point to their source function. Based on the superposition principle, general expressions have been derived for w 0, the thermal noise power generated per unit volume, per unit bandwidth, from any given source region Vs of the ionosphere, and for P 0 ([function of (italic small f) ], Vs), the available thermal noise per unit bandwidth at a receiving antenna. These expressions are valid for most regions of interest in the ionosphere where the electron collision process {{plays a major role in}} the thermal radiation and they are not limited in frequency range...|$|R
5000|$|Redshift-space distortions {{can cause}} the spacial {{distributions}} of cosmological objects to appear elongated or flattened out, depending on {{the cause of the}} peculiar velocities. Elongation, sometimes referred to as the [...] "Fingers of God" [...] effect, is caused by <b>random</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>motion</b> of objects; however, correlated peculiar velocities from gravitational infall are the cause of a flattening effect. The main consequence is that, in determining the distance of a single galaxy, a possible error must be assumed. This error becomes smaller as distance increases. For example, in surveys of type Ia supernovae, peculiar velocities have a significant influence on measurements out to redshifts around 0.5, leading to errors of several percent when calculating cosmological parameters.|$|E
50|$|Although Johnson-Nyquist noise shares many {{similarities}} with phonon noise (e.g. {{the noise}} spectral density {{depends on the}} temperature and is white at low frequencies), these two noise sources are distinct. Johnson-Nyquist noise arises from the <b>random</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>motion</b> of electrons, whereas phonon noise arises from the random exchange of phonons. Johnson-Nyquist noise is easily modeled at thermal equilibrium, where all components of the circuit are held at the same temperature. A general equilibrium model for phonon noise is usually impossible because different components of the thermal circuit are nonuniform in temperature and also often not time invariant, as in the occasional energy deposition from particles incident on a detector. The transition edge sensor typically maintains the temperature through negative electrothermal feedback associated with changes in internal electrical power.|$|E
50|$|Consider the {{particles}} emitted by Brown's pollen grain moving randomly in water: {{we know that}} a water molecule is about 0.1 by 0.2 nm in size, whereas {{the particles}} which Brown observed were {{of the order of}} a few micrometres in size (these are {{not to be confused with}} the actual pollen particle which is about 100 micrometres). So a particle from the pollen may be likened to the balloon, and the water molecules to the fans, except that in this case the balloon is surrounded by fans. The Brownian motion of a particle in a liquid is thus due to the instantaneous imbalance in the combined forces exerted by collisions of the particle with the much smaller liquid molecules (which are in <b>random</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>motion)</b> surrounding it.|$|E
40|$|The outer atmospheres {{of stars}} must be heated by some non-thermal energy flux to produce chromospheres and coronae.

The apparent failure of this long held mechanism and the growing appreciation of the importance of strong magnetic fields in the chromosphere and corona have led to hypotheses of heating by the dissipation of currents (both oscillatory and quasi-steady). This follows discoveries in laboratory and ionospheric plasmas and work on solar flares, that instabilities can concentrate currents into thin high current density filaments where they dissipate rapidly...|$|R
50|$|Aside from {{inevitable}} {{losses and}} imperfections in the engine, incomplete combustion, etc., after specific reaction energy, the main theoretical limit reducing the exhaust velocity obtained is that, {{according to the}} laws of thermodynamics, a fraction of the chemical energy may go into rotation of the exhaust molecules, where it is unavailable for producing thrust. Monatomic gases like helium have only three degrees of freedom, corresponding to the three dimensions of space, {x,y,z}, and only such spherically symmetric molecules escape this kind of loss. A diatomic molecule like H2 can rotate about either of the two axes perpendicular to the one joining the two atoms, and as the equipartition law of statistical mechanics demands that the available thermal energy be divided equally among the degrees of freedom, for such a gas in thermal equilibrium 3/5 of the energy can go into unidirectional motion, and 2/5 into rotation (actually, the vibration of the molecule should not be neglected, see gas heat capacity). A triatomic molecule like water has six degrees of freedom, so the energy is divided equally among rotational and translational degrees of freedom. For most chemical reactions the latter situation is the case. This issue is traditionally described in terms of the ratio, gamma, of the specific heat of the gas at constant volume to that at constant pressure. The rotational energy loss is largely recovered in practice if the expansion nozzle is large enough to allow the gases to expand and cool sufficiently, the function of the nozzle being to convert the <b>random</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>motions</b> of the molecules in the combustion chamber into the unidirectional translation that produces thrust. As long as the exhaust gas remains in equilibrium as it expands, the initial rotational energy will be largely returned to translation in the nozzle.|$|R
40|$|Evolution {{has created}} a class of {{proteins}} that {{have the ability to}} convert chemical energy into mechanical force. Some of these use the free energy of nucleotide hydrolysis as fuel, while others employ ion gradients. Some are “walking motors, ” others rotating engines. Some are reversible, others are unidirectional. Could there be any common principles amongst such diversity? The conversion of chemical energy into mechanical work {{is one of the main}} themes of modern biology. Biochemists characterize energy transduction schemes by free energy diagrams. But thermodynamics tells us only what cannot happen. Recent advances in laser trap and optical technology, along with advances in molecular structure determination can augment traditional biochemical kinetic and thermodynamic analyses to make possible a more mechanistic view of how protein motors function. The result of these advances has been data that yield load-velocity curves and motion statistics for single molecular motors. This sort of data enables a more detailed, mechanistic level of modeling. At Þrst, the mechanics of proteins may seem counterintuitive because their motions are dominated by Brownian motion, the name given to the frequent changes in velocity of a macromolecule as it is buffeted about by <b>random</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>motions</b> of surrounding water molecules. In addition to “smearing out ” deterministic trajectories, Brownian motion serves an effective “lubricant, ” allowing molecules to pass over high energy barriers that would arrest a deterministic system. More subtly, it makes possible “uphill” motions against an opposing force by “capturing ” occasional large thermal ßuctuations. In this chapter we will discuss protein motions on the molecular scale and derive a mathematical formalism to model such motions. To illustrate the formalism, in the next chapter, we will analyze (i) a “switch ” controlling the direction of the bacterial ßagellar motor, (ii) a polymerization ratchet, and (iii) a “toy ” model related to the F o This is page 32...|$|R

40|$|The pore {{structural}} changes associated with Cys-loop receptor gating are currently {{the subject of}} considerable interest. Several functional approaches have shown that surface exposure of pore-lining side chains does not change significantly during activation. However, a disulfide trapping study on alpha 1 (T 6 2 ̆ 7 C) beta 1 (T 6 2 ̆ 7 C) gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors (GABA(A) Rs), which showed that adjacent beta subunits cross-link in the open state only, concluded that channel gating is mediated by beta subunits contra-rotating through a summed angle of similar to 120 (o). Such a large rotation is not easily reconciled with other evidence. The present study initially sought to investigate an observation that appeared inconsistent with the rotation model: namely that alpha 1 (T 6 2 ̆ 7 C) beta 1 (T 6 2 ̆ 7 C) GABA(A) Rs expressed in HEK 293 cells form 6 2 ̆ 7 cysteine-mediated disulfide bonds in the closed state. On the basis of electrophysiological and Western blotting experiments, we conclude that adjacent beta(T 6 2 ̆ 7 C) subunits dimerise efficiently in the closed state via cross-links between their respective 6 2 ̆ 7 cysteines and that this locks the channels closed. This questions the beta. subunit contra-rotation model of activation and {{raises the question of}} how the closed state cross-links form. We propose that beta subunit 6 2 ̆ 7 cysteines move into sufficiently close proximity for disulfide formation via relatively large amplitude <b>random</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>motions</b> that appear to be a unique feature of beta subunits. Because dimerized channels are locked closed, we conclude either that the spontaneous beta subunit movements or asymmetries in the movements of adjacent beta subunits during activation are essential for pore opening.
