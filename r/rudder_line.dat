50|$|The initial tail {{configuration}} was unusual, the <b>rudder</b> hinge <b>line</b> being vertical {{when the}} aircraft {{was on the}} ground rather than when in flight.

50|$|The Grüne Post had a near {{rectangular}} horizontal tail {{of constant}} chord and slightly angled tips. A straight tapered, narrow fin was placed far enough aft that the <b>rudder</b> hinge <b>line</b> was almost beyond the elevator trailing edge; the rudder was also straight tapered, square tipped and {{reached down to}} the keel. The Grüne Post landed on a rubber sprung skid {{on the bottom of}} the fuselage platform, assisted by a small tail skid.|$|R

50|$|All the Schlesierland {{variants}} had a ply covered fuselage; {{most were}} hexagonal in cross-section, though {{that of the}} 1931 ESG 31B had a rounded, streamlined form. Early Schlesierlands had open cockpits and landed on a skid that reached from the nose to the lift strut attachment point but the 1931 Stanavo introduced a monowheel aft of the skid. At some point it was fitted with a multi-transparency cockpit canopy. The wing pedestal slowly deceases in height rearwards above the fuselage, ending about halfway to the tail. The narrow, swept tailplane is mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage; on the later 1931 variants, the ESG 31A and B, the tailplane was braced {{to the top of the}} fin. On all models except possibly the Commodore, this was ply covered and only about a third the height of the balanced rudder. Both rudder and elevators are fabric covered with rounded trailing edges; the rudder extends down to the keel and operated between the elevators. There is a small, partly faired sprung tailskid immediately ahead of the <b>rudder</b> hinge <b>line.</b>|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{aerodynamic}} investigations {{were conducted}} on a sting mounted 0. 0405 -scale representation of the - 140 A/B inner mold line (IML) space shuttle orbiter in 7. 75 x 11 foot low speed wind tunnel, during the time period from 18 March 1974 to 20 March 1974. The primary test objectives were to establish basic longitudinal and lateral-directional stability and control characteristics for the IML orbiter. Additional configurations investigated were sealed elevon hingeline gaps, sealed <b>rudder</b> split <b>line</b> and hingeline gaps, larger radius leading edge on the vertical tail, and sealed speedbrake base. Aerodynamic force and moment data for the orbiter were measured in the body-axis system by an internally mounted, six-component strain gage balance. The model was sting mounted with the center of rotation located at approximately the wing trailing edge. The nominal angle of attack range was from - 4 to + 30 degrees. Yaw polars were recorded over a nominal yaw angle range from - 14 to + 14 degrees at constant angles of attack of 0, + or - 5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees...|$|R
50|$|The Senior had a {{completely}} ply covered fuselage {{with a narrow}} ovoid cross section which was deep in the cockpit area but tapered progressively to the tail. The cockpit was {{just ahead of the}} wing, covered by a multipart glazing which, attached to a small area of the upper forward fuselage, hinged to the right for access. The rear of the canopy was above the fuselage line and a long, ply covered fairing reaching well behind the wing blended it in. A tapered, round tipped and largely fabric covered horizontal tail was mounted on top of the fuselage, far enough forward to place the trailing edges of its elevators at the <b>rudder</b> hinge <b>line.</b> The latter was mounted on a narrow ply covered fin, carefully faired into the fuselage and extending below it to form a tail bumper. The mostly fabric covered rudder was full, curved and slightly pointed, likewise extending below the fuselage.

40|$|The {{scope of}} the paper is to assess the {{potential}} of using circulation control at the vertical tail plane {{in order to increase}} the maximum rudder side force. Therefore, a numerical study on the rudder design is carried out, consisting of a 2 D sensitivity study, an estimation of the 3 D forces and moments via lifting line method, and a verification by 3 D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. Compared to the baseline <b>rudder,</b> the lifting <b>line</b> method yields a 138 % increase of the rudder yawing moment due to the use of circulation control. 3 D RANS simulations verify the lifting line results. The deviation between yawing moments from the RANS computations and the lifting line method is less than 11 %...|$|R
40|$|The XF- 12 {{airplane}} is {{a high-performance}} photo-reconnaissance aircraft {{designed for the}} Army Air Forces by the Republic Aviation Corporation. An investigation of a 1 / 8. 33 - scale powered model {{was made in the}} Langley l 9 -foot pressure tunnel to obtain information relative to the aerodynamic design of the airplane. The model was tested with and without the original vertical tail. and with two revised tails. For the revised tail no. 1, the span of the original vertical. tail was increased about 15 percent and the portion of the vertical tail between the stabilizer and fuselage behind the <b>rudder</b> hinge <b>line</b> was allowed to deflect simultaneously with the main rudder. Revision no. 2 incorporated the increased span, but the lower rudder was locked in the neutral position. For all the tail arrangements investigated it was indicated that the airplane will possess positive effective dihedral and will be directionally stable regardless of flap or power condition. The rudder effectiveness is greater for the revised tails than for the original tail, but this is offset by the increase in directional stability caused by the revised tail. All the rudder arrangements appear inadequate in trimming out the resultant yawing moments at zero yaw in a take - off condition with the left-hand outboard propeller windmilling and the remaining engines developing take-off power...|$|R
6000|$|He {{went on with}} {{a painful}} {{evenness}} of speech. [...] "When I read those words, I had only one thought--to reach them; I ran down to the river, and chose out the lightest boat. Just as I was starting, Tor came running. 'You dropped this letter, sir,' he said. 'Two pair of arms are better than one.' He came into the boat. I took the sculls and I pulled out into the stream. I pulled like a madman; and that great man, with his bare arms crossed, was like a huge, tawny bull sitting there opposite me. Presently he took my place, and I took the <b>rudder</b> <b>lines.</b> I could see his chest, covered with hair, heaving up and down, {{it gave me a}} sort of comfort--it meant that we were getting nearer. Then it grew dark, there was no moon, I could barely see the bank; there's something in the dark which drives one into oneself. People tell you there comes a moment when your nature is decided--'saved' or 'lost' as they call it--for good or evil. That is not true, your self is always with you, and cannot be altered; but, sir, I believe that in a time of agony one finds out what are the things one can do, and what are those one cannot. You get to know yourself, that's all. And so it was with me. Every thought and memory and passion was so clear and strong! I wanted to kill him. I wanted to kill myself. But her--no! We are taught that we possess our wives, body and soul, we are brought up in that faith, we are commanded to believe it--but when I was face to face with it, those words had no meaning; that belief, those commands, they were without meaning to me, they were--vile. Oh yes, I wanted to find comfort in them, I wanted to hold on to them--but I couldn't. You may force a body; how can you force a soul? No, no--cowardly! But I wanted to--I wanted to kill him and force her to come back to me! And then, suddenly, I felt as if I were pressing right on the most secret nerve of my heart. I seemed to see her face, white and quivering, as if I'd stamped my heel on it. They say this world is ruled by force; it may be true--I know I have a weak spot in me.... I couldn't bear it. At last I Jumped to my feet and shouted out, 'Turn the boat round!' Tor looked up at me as if I had gone mad. And I had gone mad. I seized the boat-hook and threatened him; I called him fearful names. 'Sir,' he said, 'I don't take such names from any one!' 'You'll take them from me,' I shouted; 'turn the boat round, you idiot, you hound, you fish!...' I have a terrible temper, a perfect curse to me. He seemed amazed, even frightened; he sat down again suddenly and pulled the boat round. I fell on the seat, and hid my face. I believe the moon came up; {{there must have been a}} mist too, for I was cold as death. In this life, sir, we cannot hide our faces--but by degrees the pain of wounds grows less. Some will have it that such blows are mortal; it is not so. Time is merciful.|$|R
40|$|In {{designing}} a ship, propulsive efficiency is a parameter which always is {{tried to be}} kept as optimum as possible. An investigation in full scale and model scale of a ship including propeller and rudder, regarding the effect of changing rudder position on variation of propeller characteristics has been carried out. SHIPFLOW software was utilized to apply Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) techniques in order to compute the flow around the ship hull, propeller and <b>rudder.</b> Lifting <b>line</b> method which is coupled with RANS solver module of SHIPFLOW is used to simulate and also compute the propeller characteristics. Five different longitudinal rudder positions were investigated and compared {{to each other in}} order to determine the optimum longitudinal position of rudder. Furthermore, in model scale, for optimum longitudinal rudder position, one different transverse position of rudder was also evaluated. For computing propeller characteristics, SELFPROPULSION command was applied into computations in order to achieve balance between drag and thrust by adjusting the shaft RPM. In order to evaluate the accuracy of results for these two different scales, computed results for original rudder position in model scale and full scale were compared with test results and predicted results by ITTC 1978 method, respectively. Computed results in model scale, thrust and torque, show a good agreement with test results but obtained results from computations for full scale, such as delivered power and effective power seem to be over predicted compared to predicted results by ITTC 1978 method. Consequently, optimum rudder position was determined based on model scale results which are reasonably accurate compared to full scale computed results. The reason which made full scale computation results over predicted can be described regarding to grid resolution at the aft part of ship hull which is not compatible with propeller grids. This causes inaccurate interpolation between propeller and hull/rudder grids which concludes over predicted results for full scale...|$|R
50|$|It was a {{shoulder}} wing aircraft {{with a double}} straight tapered gull wing, built around two spars and fabric covered apart from the leading edge from the front spar forward and the wing roots, which were plywood skinned. The wing roots were carefully faired into the fuselage. The inner panels, filling about {{one third of the}} span had only slight taper, the sweep entirely on the trailing edge; the inner parts of them carried about 10° of dihedral but they flattened outboard. Spoilers were mounted on the bend, behind the front spar and opening above the wing. The outer panels had no dihedral but were strongly tapered, swept mostly on the trailing edge with a taper ratio of 0.42. Ailerons occupied the whole of the outer panels' trailing edges. The Junior had a completely ply covered fuselage with a narrow ovoid cross section which tapered progressively to the tail. The cockpit was just ahead of the wing, under a largely ply fairing smoothly integrated into the nose and fuselage; its only transparencies were portholes in its slightly concave sides. The cockpit fairing was removable for access; aft, it blended immediately into the fuselage line without the long fairing of the Sperber Senior. A tapered, round tipped and largely fabric covered horizontal tail was mounted on top of the fuselage, far enough forward to place the trailing edges of its elevators at the <b>rudder</b> hinge <b>line.</b> The latter was mounted on a narrow ply covered fin, carefully faired into the fuselage and extending below it to form a tail bumper. The mostly fabric covered rudder was full, curved and slightly pointed, likewise extending below the fuselage.

5000|$|To {{control the}} airplane, the lines must remain in tension. Centrifugal force is {{generally}} sufficient to maintain line tension if the airplane is properly [...] "trimmed" [...] (adjusted), but sometimes additional {{features such as}} rudder offset and engine offset are added to provide extra tension. Weight in the outboard wing tip is usually used to balance {{the weight of the}} lines. Top aerobatics models typically have a large number of adjustable features like tip weight boxes, adjustable <b>rudder</b> offset, adjustable <b>line</b> sweep, and adjustable elevator and flap controls. Some aerobatics models use a variable rudder system (commonly called the Rabe rudder after its inventor, Al Rabe) to vary the rudder offset during flight. The adjustment of the various adjustable features on a modern stunt model can become quite complex.Many models also feature a longer inboard wing; aerobatics models use this to balance the lift from side-to-side, compensating for the difference in velocity from inboard to outboard wing, while some speed models use a very exaggerated longer inboard wing to provide streamlining of the flying lines. On small speed models the drag of the flying lines can be three times the drag {{of the rest of the}} model.|$|R
40|$|Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is {{currently}} being used for scientific research, commercial and military underwater applications. AUV requires autonomous guidance and control systems to perform underwater applications. This Thesis is concerned with position and heading control of AUV using Model Predictive Control. Position control is a typical motion control problem, which {{is concerned with the}} design of control laws that force a vehicle to reach and maintain a fixed position. The position control of body fixed x-axis to a fixed point using MPC toolbox of MATLAB is done here. System is modelled Using INFANTE AUV hydrodynamic parameters. There is physical limitation on thruster value. Heading control is concerned with the design of control laws that force a vehicle to reach and maintain a fixed direction. There are physical limitations on control input (Rudder deflection) in heading control also a high yaw rate can produce sway and roll motion, which makes it necessary to put constraint on yaw rate. The MPC have a clear advantage in case of control and input constraints. To avoid constraint violation and feasibility issues of MPC for AUV heading control Disturbance Compensating (DC) MPC scheme is used. The DC-MPC scheme is used for ship motion control and gave better results so we are using the proposed scheme to AUV heading control. A 2 DOF AUV model is taken with yaw rate and <b>rudder</b> deflection constraints. <b>Line</b> of sight (LOS) guidance scheme is utilised to generate the reference heading, which is to be followed. Two types of disturbances are taken constant and sinusoidal. Then simulation has been done for standard MPC, M-MPC and DC-MPC. A (DC) MPC algorithm is used to satisfy the state constraints in presence of disturbance to get a better performance. Standard MPC gives good result without disturbance. But in case of disturbance yaw constraint is violated. At many time steps the standard MPC has no solution for given yaw rate constraint at those time steps the constraints have been removed. The M-MPC satisfies the constraints. The DC-MPC gives better result in comparison to standard MPC and Modified MPC. The steady state oscillations are less in DC-MPC as compared to M-MPC for sinusoidal disturbances. The minimization of extra cost function in DC-MPC makes the result better than M-MPC. By solving the extra cost function we try to make response close to that of without disturbance. The only added complexity in DC-MPC is ni-dimensional optimization problem. Which is very less compared to Np*ni, complexity of M-MPC. Where ni is the dimension of control input and Np is value of prediction horizon. The feasibility of DC-MPC scheme largely depends on the magnitude of disturbance. If disturbance is too large then this scheme is not feasible. ...|$|R
