25|$|When the {{diagonal}} tiles {{were replaced by}} a <b>repetitive</b> <b>pattern</b> of horizontal polychrome tiles, one could obtain a new design with different motifs, interlacing Mannerist drawings with representations of roses and camelias (sometimes roses and garlands). An inset votive usually depicts {{a scene from the}} life of Christ or a saint. These carpet compositions (azulejo de tapete), as they were called, elaborately framed with friezes and borders, were produced in great numbers during the 17th century. The best examples {{are to be found in}} the Igreja do Salvador, Évora, Igreja de S. Quintino, Obral de Monte Agraço, Igreja de S. Vicente, Cuba (Portugal) and the university chapel in Coimbra.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{gameplay}} received polarized reception. Marc Camron from Electronic Gaming Monthly {{called it}} [...] "basic", {{and thought that}} despite the [...] fluid and smooth combat, {{and the addition of}} the reward system which added a layer of strategy to the game, the game's execution system hindered the flow of the game by slowing down the overall pace of combat. He added that the game's combat lacked complexity and depth, and was too repetitive for players to enjoy. Albert also thought that the combat system was too basic. In addition, he noted the <b>repetitive</b> <b>pattern</b> of enemies. He also criticized the game's over-emphasis on graphics, which led to the simple gameplay. Cooper thought that the game's combat was satisfying, and thought that the game's swordplay had successfully captured the sense of weight and impact. However, he also considered the system repetitive. Reiner criticized the execution sequences, which he considered excessive and over-simplistic. Shoemaker also thought that the game lacked both variety and depth. Mark Walton from GameSpot thought that the game design was too linear, and that the game discouraged any form of exploration.|$|E

40|$|Finding <b>repetitive</b> <b>patterns</b> is {{important}} to many applications such as bioinformatics, finance and speech processing, etc. <b>Repetitive</b> <b>patterns</b> can be either cyclic or acyclic such that the patterns are continuous and distributed respectively. In this paper, {{we are going to}} find <b>repetitive</b> <b>patterns</b> in a given motion signal without prior knowledge about the type of motion. It is relatively easier to find <b>repetitive</b> <b>patterns</b> in discrete signal that contains a limited number of states by dynamic programming. However, it is impractical to identify exactly matched states in a continuous signal such as captured human motion data. A point cloud similarity of the input motion signal itself is considered and the longest similar patterns are located by tracing and extending matched posture pairs. Through pattern alignment and autoclustering, cyclic and acyclic patterns are identified. Experiment results show that our approach can locate repetitive movements with small error rates...|$|R

ApEn reflects the likelihood that similar patterns of observations will not be followed by additional similar observations. A time series containing many <b>repetitive</b> <b>patterns</b> has a relatively small ApEn; a less predictable process has a higher ApEn.|$|R
500|$|In 1910, Smith {{published}} Songs of a Little Child’s Day, {{which included}} 66 songs of original compositions by Smith and text by Emilie Poulsson. The songs {{focused on a}} limited range {{to make it easy}} for high-pitched children's voices to sing the works and most of the songs contained sixteen bars or less. Accompaniment lines for the piano, duplicated the vocal lines, but had artistic flourishes, such as a section in the piece [...] "The Busy Wind", which used a <b>repetitive</b> <b>pattern</b> of sixteenth notes to imitate the sound of blowing wind. In honor of the 25th anniversary of Hull House, in 1915, five of Smith's compositions were published as The Hull-House Songs. The themes represented social issues which were prevalent at the time including [...] "The Land of the Noonday Night" [...] about mining safety, the [...] "Suffrage Song" [...] about women's voting, and [...] "The Shadow Child" [...] about child labor with words penned by poet, Harriet Monroe. As early as 1901, she had written compositions for poems with social themes, such as the work she created for Morris Rosenfeld's poem [...] "Sweat Shop". Other works Smith authored include: [...] "Song Pictures"; [...] "Twelve Songs for Twelve Boys"; [...] "The Golden Asp" [...] (cantata); [...] "Wedding Music" [...] (No. 1 and No. 2); [...] "Trolls' Holiday" [...] (operetta); and [...] "Twelve Songs". Her works continued to be popular into the 1980s, attesting to the quality of their composition.|$|E
500|$|To {{deal with}} these limitations, Frye {{simplified}} the maze's intricate pattern of corridors to a more <b>repetitive</b> <b>pattern.</b> The small tan pellets in the arcade original were changed to rectangular [...] "wafers" [...] that shared the wall color on the 2600, a change necessitated because both the pellets and walls were drawn with the 2600's Playfield graphics, which have a fixed width. To achieve the visual effect of wafers disappearing as Pac-Man eats them, the actual map of the maze was updated as the data was written into the Playfield registers, excluding those pellets that had been eaten. The 2600's Player-Missile graphics system (sprites) {{were used for the}} remaining objects, the one pixel-wide Missiles were used to render the flashing power pills and the center of the vitamin. [...] Pac-Man and ghost characters were implemented using the 2600's two Player objects, with one being used for Pac-Man and the other being used in for all four ghosts, with the result that each ghost only appears once out of every four frames, which creates a flickering effect. This effect takes advantage of the slow phosphorescent fade of CRT monitors and the concept of persistence of vision, resulting in the image appearing to linger on screen longer, but the flickering remains noticeable, and makes each individual ghost's color nearly impossible to discern. Frye chose to abandon plans for a flicker-management system to minimize the flashing in part because Atari didn't seem to care about that issue in its zeal to have the game released. His game also did not conform to the arcade game's color scheme in order to comply with Atari's official home product policy that only space type games should feature black backgrounds. [...] Another quality-impact was his decision that two-player gameplay was important, which meant that the 23 bytes required to store the current difficulty, state of the dots on the current maze, remaining lives, and score had to be doubled for a second player, consuming 46 of the 2600's meager 128 byte memory, which precluded its use for additional game data and features.|$|E

40|$|Discovering <b>repetitive</b> <b>patterns</b> is {{important}} {{in a wide range}} of research areas, such as bioinformatics and human movement analysis. This study puts forward a new methodology to identify, visualise and interpret <b>repetitive</b> motion <b>patterns</b> in groups of Moving Point Objects (MPOs). The methodology consists of three steps. First, motion patterns are qualitatively described using the Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC). Second, a similarity analysis is conducted to compare motion <b>patterns</b> and identify <b>repetitive</b> <b>patterns.</b> Third, <b>repetitive</b> motion <b>patterns</b> are represented and interpreted in a continuous triangular model. As an illustration of the usefulness of combining these hitherto separated methods, a specific movement case is examined: Samba dance, a rhythmical dance will? many repetitive movements.

As in linear GP, <b>repetitive</b> <b>patterns</b> are present in large numbers. Size fair crossover limits bloat in automatic programming, preventing the evolution of recurring motifs.

We relate this emergent phenomenon to considerations about building blocks in GP and how GP works. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{algorithm}} for structural analysis of audio to detect <b>repetitive</b> <b>patterns</b> that {{are suitable for}} content-based audio information retrieval systems, since <b>repetitive</b> <b>patterns</b> can provide valuable information {{about the content of}} audio, such as a chorus or a concept. The Audio Spectrum Flatness (ASF) feature of the MPEG- 7 standard, although not having been considered as much as other feature types, has been utilized and evaluated as the underlying feature set. Expressive summaries are chosen as the longest patterns by the k-means clustering algorithm. Proposed approach is evaluated on a test bed consisting of popular song and speech clips based on the ASF feature. The well known Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are also considered in the experiments for the evaluation of features. Experiments show that, all the <b>repetitive</b> <b>patterns</b> and their locations are obtained with the accuracy of 93 % and 78 % for music and speech, respectively. 1...|$|R
