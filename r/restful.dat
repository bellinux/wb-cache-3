5|$|Human {{eyes have}} color receptors known as cone cells, {{of which there}} are three types. In some cases, one is missing or faulty, which can cause color blindness, {{including}} the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green, known as deuteranopia or redgreen color blindness. Green is <b>restful</b> to the eye. Studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th century, {{green was}} {{associated}} with the romantic movement in literature and art. The French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau celebrated the virtues of nature, The German poet and philosopher Goethe declared that green was the most <b>restful</b> color, suitable for decorating bedrooms. Painters such as John Constable and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot depicted the lush green of rural landscapes and forests. Green was contrasted to the smoky grays and blacks of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1906, Mahler had been {{director}} of the Vienna Hofoper for nine years. Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna {{at the close of}} the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this haven had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these <b>restful</b> surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No.4, No.5, No.6 and No.7 symphonies, his Rückert songs and his song cycle Kindertotenlieder ("Songs on the Death of Children").|$|E
5|$|Individuals with {{breathing}} difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality sleep {{that can be}} addressed by specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations. Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep, reducing the ability to stay asleep and to achieve <b>restful</b> sleep. For individuals with allergies or asthma, additional considerations {{must be given to}} potential triggers in the bedroom environment. Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways, so there must be careful management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines.|$|E

25|$|Since version 2.0, Ruby on Rails offers both HTML and XML as {{standard}} output formats. The latter is the facility for <b>RESTful</b> web services.|$|E
25|$|Plex Media Server via its web-based {{structure}} has a <b>RESTful</b> API returning either XML or JSON responses. This API {{provides a way}} for clients to browse and manage media libraries, as well as rich transcode functionality for video, images, and audio and synchronization.|$|E
25|$|The API {{provides}} a suitable method for retrieving {{data in a}} programmatic way. It uses a <b>RESTful</b> system that allows users to query URI endpoints and receive XML as results. The API has URI endpoints {{for a number of}} different types of requests. These requests can be used to, find specific samples, find specific groups, search for groups, search for samples and to search for samples within a group.|$|E
25|$|Dietary and {{nutritional}} choices affect sleep duration and quality. Research is being conducted {{in an attempt}} to discover what kinds of nutritional choices result in better sleep quality. A study in the Western Journal of Nursing Research in 2011 compared how sleep quality was affected by four different diets: a high-protein diet, a high-fat diet, a high-carbohydrate diet, and a control diet. Results indicated that the diets high in protein resulted in fewer wakeful episodes during night-time sleep. The high carbohydrate diet was linked to much shorter periods of quiescent or <b>restful</b> sleep. These results suggest that ingested nutrients do play a role in determining sleep quality. Another investigation published in Nutrition Research in 2012 examined the effects of various combinations of dietary choices in regard to sleep. Although {{it is difficult to determine}} one perfect diet for sleep enhancement, this study indicated that a variety of micro and macro nutrients are needed to maintain levels of healthful and <b>restful</b> sleep. A varied diet containing fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat proteins, and whole grains can be the best nutritional option for individuals seeking to improve the quality of their sleep.|$|E
25|$|Beaver Lake is a <b>restful</b> space nestled {{among the}} trees. The lake is almost {{completely}} covered with water lilies (introduced for the Queen’s Jubilee in 1938) {{and home to}} beavers, fish, and water birds. As of 1997, its surface area was just short of , but the lake is slowly shrinking in size. One of Vancouver's few remaining free-flowing streams, Beaver Creek, joins Beaver Lake to the Pacific Ocean {{and is one of}} two streams in Vancouver where salmon still return to spawn each year.|$|E
25|$|The {{sleeping}} car or sleeper is a railroad passenger car that can accommodate passengers in beds, primarily to make nighttime travel more <b>restful.</b> The first such cars saw sporadic use on American railroads in the 1830s {{and could be}} configured for coach seating during the day. The pioneer of this new mode of traveling transcontinental was the Cumberland Valley Railroad which introduced service of the first {{sleeping car}} {{in the spring of}} 1939. The sleeping car did not become commercially practical until 1857 when George Pullman invented the Pullman sleeping car.|$|E
25|$|NREM Stage 3 (N3 – deep sleep, slow-wave sleep – 15–25% {{of total}} sleep in adults): Formerly divided into stages 3 and 4, {{this stage is}} called slow-wave sleep (SWS) or deep sleep. SWS is {{initiated}} in the preoptic area and consists of delta activity, high amplitude waves at less than 3.5Hz. The sleeper is less responsive to the environment; many environmental stimuli no longer produce any reactions. Slow-wave sleep {{is thought to be}} the most <b>restful</b> form of sleep, the phase which most relieves subjective feelings of sleepiness and restores the body.|$|E
25|$|Fatigue is {{generally}} considered a more long-term condition than sleepiness (somnolence). Although sleepiness can be a symptom of medical issues, it usually results from lack of <b>restful</b> sleep, {{or a lack of}} stimulation. Chronic fatigue, on the other hand, is a symptom of a greater medical problem in most cases. It manifests in mental or physical weariness and inability to complete tasks at normal performance. Both are often used interchangeably and even categorized under the description of 'being tired.' Oftentimes fatigue is described as an uncomfortable tiredness, whereas sleepiness is comfortable and inviting.|$|E
25|$|You {{hear a lot}} {{of third}} baseman raving about the hard chances they get, but any time the shortstop is looking for a berth that is nice and quiet and <b>restful</b> in {{comparison}} to his own he casts longing glances at third. Look up the records and see what becomes of the shortstops who get too old to cover all the ground between second base and the foul line. A lot of them camp on third for a while. And why shouldn't they? A man can play third when he can't play short. That's a cinch.|$|E
25|$|Ruby on Rails is also {{noteworthy}} for its {{extensive use}} of the JavaScript libraries, Prototype and Script.aculo.us, for scripting Ajax actions. Ruby on Rails initially utilized lightweight SOAP for web services; this was later replaced by <b>RESTful</b> web services. Ruby on Rails 3.0 uses a technique called Unobtrusive JavaScript to separate the functionality (or logic) from {{the structure of the}} web page. jQuery is fully supported as a replacement for Prototype and is the default JavaScript library in Rails 3.1, reflecting an industry-wide move towards jQuery. Additionally, CoffeeScript was introduced in Rails 3.1 as the default Javascript language.|$|E
25|$|Published in February 2014 by the OpenID Foundation, {{the third}} {{generation}} of OpenID technology, OpenID Connect, is an authentication layer that sits {{on top of the}} OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. It allows computing clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain the basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner. In technical terms, OpenID Connect specifies a <b>RESTful</b> HTTP API, using JSON as a data format. OpenID Connect allows a range of organizations, including web-based, mobile and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. The OpenID Connect specification is extensible, supporting optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID providers, and session management.|$|E
25|$|A {{controller}} is a server-side {{component of}} Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application, by determining which view file to render. The controller {{may also have}} to query one or more models for information and pass these on to the view. For example, in an airline reservation system, a controller implementing a flight-search function would need to query a model representing individual flights to find flights matching the search, and might also need to query models representing airports and airlines to find related secondary data. The controller might then pass some subset of the flight data to the corresponding view, which would contain a mixture of static HTML and logic that use the flight data to create an HTML document containing a table with one row per flight. A controller may provide one or more actions. In Ruby on Rails, an action is typically a basic unit that describes {{how to respond to}} a specific external web-browser request. Also, note that the controller/action will be accessible for external web requests only if a corresponding route is mapped to it. Rails encourages developers to use <b>RESTful</b> routes, which include actions such as create, new, edit, update, destroy, show, and index. These mappings of incoming requests/routes to controller actions can be easily set up in the routes.rb configuration file.|$|E

A private eating club used {{to operate at}} the top of the building. Called the Midday Club, it was {{intended}} [...] "to provide in the heart of the financial district, removed from the noise and activity of the street, a place where businessmen can dine in a <b>restful</b> atmosphere with their business associates". The Midday Club opened in 1929 and closed in 1978.|$|E

[...] In his interview on Parkinson he stated that if he could go back in time to do one thing, it would be to go to the building of Stonehenge, to ask them [...] "why they were bothering". He is a cricket and snooker fan, and also plays the occasional game of squash and tennis. He is a user of Twitter, and does not drive. He is an agnostic.|$|E
500|$|The Apostle {{garden is}} aligned {{on the front}} door in the East front of the house and a {{building}} which {{has been described as a}} water tower, built by the Jenners in imitation of the dovecote at Avebury Manor, which was wrongly identified as a Dovecote by English Heritage. The garden is a severe, formal approach, flanked by topiarised yews, and is [...] "deliberately low-key and simple so as not to distract from the beauty of the building". The main border is [...] long and at its best in midsummer. The flowers grade from blues and yellows, through creams and apricots to pinks, mauves and reds. There is a <b>restful</b> White Garden beyond for contrast.|$|E
500|$|Lafayette {{arrived at}} New York on 15 August 1824, {{accompanied}} by his son Georges Washington and his secretary Auguste Levasseur. On arrival, Lafayette was greeted {{by a group of}} Revolutionary War veterans, who had fought alongside him many years before. [...] New York erupted for four continuous days and nights of celebration. When he departed for what he thought would be a <b>restful</b> trip to Boston, he instead found the route lined by cheering citizens, with welcomes organized in every town along the way. According to Unger, [...] "It was a mystical experience they would relate to their heirs through generations to come. [...] Lafayette had materialized from a distant age, the last leader and hero at the nation's defining moment. They knew they and the world would never see his kind again." ...|$|E
500|$|Iron Rattler has {{generally}} been well received. Keith Miller of Funworld Magazine described the ride as [...] "wonderfully smooth" [...] highlighting the slow cresting of the lift hill as an [...] "enjoyable element". He concludes by stating [...] "there's not one <b>restful</b> moment on this ride". Arthur Levine of About.com gave the ride 4.5 out of 5 stars. Levine applauded Six Flags for replacing a bad wooden roller coaster with [...] "a wonderful, remarkably smooth, thoroughly fun and enjoyable ride". He also gives kudos to Rocky Mountain Construction who manufactured the I-Box track and redesigned the ride. Brenda Solis of KLQB described the ride as [...] "the most intense, craziest roller coaster ever". She also compared the renovated ride to the original ride, stating [...] "the old Rattler wasn't as scary or intense or fast as the new one".|$|E
500|$|Johansson transitioned from teen {{to adult}} roles with two films in 2003: the romantic comedy-drama Lost in Translation and the drama Girl with a Pearl Earring. In the former, {{directed}} by Sofia Coppola, she plays Charlotte, a listless and lonely young wife, opposite Bill Murray. Coppola had first noticed Johansson in Manny & Lo, and compared {{her to a}} young Lauren Bacall; Coppola wrote the film's story based {{on the relationship between}} Humphrey Bogart and Bacall in The Big Sleep (1946). Johansson immediately accepted the part and found the experience of working with a female director different because of Coppola's ability to empathize with her. Made on a budget of $4million, the film earned $119million at the box office and received positive reviews from critics. Roger Ebert was pleased with the film and described the lead performances as [...] "wonderful", and Entertainment Weekly wrote of Johansson's [...] "embracing, <b>restful</b> serenity". The New York Times praised Johansson, then 18, for playing an older character.|$|E
500|$|Another Green World {{represents}} {{a turning point}} in Eno's musical career. While his previous albums contained quirky rock songs, only five of the fourteen tracks on the album have lyrics. Music critic Jim DeRogatis called it an [...] "ambient/art-pop" [...] album. According to eMusic's Richard Gehr, the album's music veers from the guitar-oriented experimental rock of Eno's 1974 albums Here Come the Warm Jets and Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) to the synth-oriented ambient minimalism of his subsequent work. Its minimalist instrumentals are scattered among more structured art-rock songs. According to AllMusic's Steve Huey, most of the album has [...] "paced instrumentals that, while often closer to ambient music than pop, are both melodic and rhythmic", and are accompanied by few pop songs, including [...] "St. Elmo's Fire", [...] "I'll Come Running", and [...] "Golden Hours". The instrumental tracks explore a new kind of sound that is more quiet and <b>restful,</b> marking the change between Eno's earlier rock songs and his later instrumental works in which texture and timbre are the most important musical elements. Dave Simpson described the album as creating a [...] "largely song-based electronic pop." ...|$|E
500|$|Seiken Densetsu: Rise of Mana Original Soundtrack was {{released}} on April 23, 2014 through Square Enix's music label. Andrew Barker of RPGFan was cautiously positive about the album: he described [...] "Believe in the Spirit" [...] as being [...] "hit-or-miss" [...] for different listeners while evoking memories of earlier Mana games. The rest of the soundtrack was generally praised: the first half's <b>restful</b> melodies were the stand-out tracks and {{said to be the}} strongest, while the later upbeat tracks were praised for their various energizing qualities. Some tracks, such as [...] "The Drip Drip Drip of Memory", being fairly weak and forgettable.Barker generally compared the music to that of Final Fantasy XII, recommending it for fans of the latter and finishing that the album was generally good despite some unmemorable pieces. Chris Greening of Video Game Music Online gave the album a 2.5-star rating: he was most positive about the tracks from the guest composers like Ito and Shimomura. While he praised Sekito for moving away from his traditional musical style, he felt that the result was fairly mixed, with some tracks lacking the proper emotional drive and others [...] "falling flat". [...] "Believe in the Spirit" [...] was praised for avoiding J-pop elements and sticking with its Celtic style, being favorably compared to the theme songs of Xenogears. Overall, Green felt that, while it had good production value and was substantially better than other mobile game soundtracks, but lacked the emotional impact of previous Mana titles in the majority of its tracks. Many reviewers of the game also praised the soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|Jaws 3-D had two 3D consultants: the {{production}} started with Chris Condon, president of StereoVision, and Stan Loth was later {{added to the}} team for the Arrivision 3D. Production began using the StereoVision, but this was dropped after {{a week for the}} Arrivision system, [...] "which Alves believed was a superior system because it has a wider variety of lenses". According to Alves, inferior systems lead to ghosting and blurring, leaving audiences with headaches. He says that [...] "the left and right images [...] are very well-matched, and the photography is very clean; it's <b>restful</b> to the eye, and though we do have the occasional effects where things do emerge toward the audience from the plane of projection, you come out of the film without a headache." [...] Historian R. M. Hayes says that the film was shot using both the Arrivision and StereoVision single strip-over-and-under units. Both cameras were used in conjunction with each other. This is a means of shooting 3D movies in normal color with a single camera and single strip of film: the Arrivision 3D technique uses a special twin-lens adapter fitted to the film camera, and divides the 35mm film frame in half along the middle, capturing the left-eye image in the upper half of the frame and the right-eye image in the lower half – this is known as [...] "over/under". This allows filming to proceed as for any standard 2D film, without the considerable additional expense of having to double up on cameras and film stock for every shot. When the resultant film is projected through a normal projector (albeit one requiring a special lens that combines the upper and lower images), a true polarised 3D image is produced. This system allows 3D films to be shown in almost any cinema since it does not require two projectors running simultaneously through the presentation – something most cinemas are not equipped to handle. What is required of the theatre is both the special projection lens and a reflective [...] "silver" [...] screen to enable the polarized images to reflect back to the viewer with the appropriate filter on each eye blocking out the wrong image, thus leaving the viewer to see the film from two angles as the eyes naturally see the world. According to the company that built the underwater camera housings for Jaws 3-D, the underwater sequences were shot using an Arriflex 35–3 camera with Arrivision 18mm over/under 3D lens.|$|E

2500|$|Ross {{works in}} a variety of moods—simple, elegant portraits; soft, earth-toned landscapes; and studies of {{historical}} work based on old master paintings. [...] The latter are not literal copies but rather abstract compositions that [...] "show the power of the old master's sense of composition and form." [...] (Keefer 2005, pp. G3-G4) [...] As time goes on, Ross is increasingly interested in scenes of contemporary working class life. [...] He approaches such subjects without a shrill, messianic desire to foment action, but to work with the idea of expressing an abstract notion of social harmony. [...] So, Ross's subject matter is strong, but <b>restful,</b> while his style and handling of paint convey a gestural energy that keeps each canvas lively.|$|E
2500|$|Shabbat ( [...] ; [...] , [...] "rest" [...] or [...] "cessation") or Shabbos ( [...] , [...] ) or the Sabbath is Judaism's day of {{rest and}} seventh day of the week, on which {{religious}} Jews and certain Christians (such as Seventh Day Adventists and Seventh Day Baptists) remember the Biblical creation of the heavens and the earth in six days and the Exodus of the Hebrews, {{and look forward to}} a future Messianic Age. Shabbat observance entails refraining from work activities, often with great rigor, and engaging in <b>restful</b> activities to honor the day. Judaism's traditional position is that unbroken seventh-day Shabbat originated among the Jewish people, as their first and most sacred institution, though some suggest other origins. Variations upon Shabbat are widespread in Judaism and, with adaptations, throughout the Abrahamic and many other religions.|$|E
