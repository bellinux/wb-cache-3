60|$|The man wrote a {{few lines}} on his card. Perhaps the lady would be kind {{enough to say that}} he had sent her. The lady, thanking him, partly lifted her veil to show a charming smile, and {{gracefully}} withdrew. The photographer was pleased. Miss Brown had evidently got another sitter, and, from that momentary glimpse of her face, it would be a picture as beautiful and attractive as the man's. But what was the odd idea that struck him? She certainly reminded him of some one! There was the same heavy hair, only this lady's was golden, and she was older and more mature. And he <b>remained</b> for a <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> knitted brows musing over his counter.|$|R
60|$|Then {{came the}} moment of the evening which, of all the moments, was the most trying to her. Luke Rowan came to claim her hand for the next quadrille. She had already spoken to him,--or rather he to her; but that had been in the {{presence}} of a third person, when, of course, nothing could be said about the sunset and the clouds,--nothing about that promise of friendship. But now she would have to stand again with him in solitude,--a solitude of another kind,--in a solitude which was authorized, during which he might whisper what words he pleased to her, and from which she could not even run away. It had been thought to be a great sin on her part to have <b>remained</b> a <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> him by the stile; but now she was to stand up with him beneath the glare of the lights, dressed in her best, on purpose that he might whisper to her what words he pleased. But she was sure--she thought that she was sure, that he would utter no words so sweet, so full of meaning, as those in which he bade her watch the arm in the clouds.|$|R

Let us speak of Amina, your wife, with whom I was acquainted before her marriage. I was aware that she was a magician, and she knew too that I had studied the same art, under the same mistress. We met often going to the same baths, but we did not like each other, and never sought to become friends.

40|$|Using {{high-resolution}} {{neutron diffraction}} measurements for Mn-rich hexagonal Mn-Fe-P-Si compounds, {{we show that}} the substitution of Mn for Fe on the 3 f sites results in a linear decrease of the Fe/Mn(3 f) magnetic moments, while the Mn(3 g) magnetic <b>moments</b> <b>remain</b> constant. <b>With</b> increasing temperature, the Mn(3 g) magnetic moments show almost no change, while the Fe/Mn(3 f) moments decrease quickly when the transition temperature is approached. The reduction of the magnetic moments at the transition temperature and in the high-temperature range is discussed based on changes in interatomic distances and lattice parameters and high-temperature magnetic-susceptibility measurement. © 2012, American Physical Society...|$|R
60|$|Brigadier-General Clarence Brant <b>remained</b> for a <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> {{his head}} bent in {{thoughtful}} {{contemplation of the}} coolness of his veteran chief under this exciting disclosure, and the strategy with which he had frustrated the traitor's success. Then his eye caught the sealed packet in his belt. He mechanically drew it out, and broke the seal. The envelope was filled with papers and memorandums. But {{as he looked at}} them his face darkened and his brow knit. He glanced quickly around him. The staff had trotted away; the captain and his detail were continuing their work at a little distance. He took a long breath, for he was holding in his hand a tracing of their camp, even of the position he was to occupy tomorrow, and a detailed account of the movements, plans, and force of the whole division as had been arranged in council of war the day before the battle! But there was no indication of the writer or his intentions.|$|R
60|$|But {{he did not}} {{hesitate}} for one breath. He {{was on his feet}} and running along the narrow coping that went across the house under the third floor windows, running there on that narrow footing away above the street, straight to the flag. He had got it--he had clutched it in his hand, a handful of it. Exactly like a great flame rose the simultaneous yell of the crowd as the boy jerked and got the flag loose. He had torn it down. A tremendous prolonged yell, touched with a snarl of triumph, and searing like a puff of flame, sounded as the boy <b>remained</b> for one <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> the flag in his hand looking down at the crowd below. His face was odd and elated and still. Then with the slightest gesture he threw the flag from him, and Aaron watched the gaudy remnant falling towards the many faces, whilst the noise of yelling rose up unheard.|$|R

[...] "She's a good girl, and I never {{want to see a}} more uncomplainin'; but I know it's duller and duller here all the while for her, with us two old folks, and no young company; and I d'know as it's been any better the two winters she's taught in the Mill Village. That's what reconciles me, on Lyddy's account, as much as anything. I ain't one to set much store on worldly ambition, and I never was; and I d'know as I care for Lyddy's advancement, as you may call it. I believe that as far forth as true {{happiness}} goes she'd be as well off here as there. But I don't say but what she would be more satisfied in the end, and as long as you can't have happiness, in this world, I say you'd better have satisfaction. Is that Josiah Whitman's hearse goin' past?" [...] she asked, rising from her chair, and craning forward to bring her eyes on a level with the window, while she suspended the agitation of the palm-leaf fan which she had not ceased to ply during her talk; she <b>remained</b> a <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> the quiescent fan pressed against her bosom, and then she stepped out of the door, and down the walk to the gate. [...] "Josiah!" [...] she called, while the old man looked and listened at the window. [...] "Who you be'n buryin'?" ...|$|R

Even for higher {{education}} institutions (HEIs) experienced with accreditation evaluations, they <b>remain</b> a key <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> high stakes. In Flanders, accreditation is based on periodic program evaluations by an external body. A positive advice by a commission of external experts, appointed by a government organization, is a necessary condition for further accreditation. Evaluation commissions heavily depend on interviews with stakeholder groups to determine whether applicable standards are met. Time for interviews, however, is exceedingly limited. Getting the intended impression across can be difficult, especially if the stakeholders are not skilled speakers. Moreover, stakeholders’ perceptions may be misinformed. Coaching stakeholders to communicate efficiently has accordingly become crucial for HEIs to receive an accurate evaluation. This paper describes an approach to coaching based on scientific insights from the fields of social psychology and communication. The approach was adopted for an engineering program located at six campuses, to be visited within the time constraints of four days, including fourteen group interviews with a total of 150 individuals. The subsequent steps in the coaching process are described with reference to supporting scientific theories. status: publishe...|$|R
