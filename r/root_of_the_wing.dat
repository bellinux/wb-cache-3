60|$|The Wings of {{all kinds}} of Insects, are, for the most part, very {{beautifull}} Objects, and afford no less pleasing an Object to the mind to speculate upon, then to the eye to behold. This of the blue Fly, among the rest, wants not its peculiar ornaments and contrivances; it grows out of the Thorax, or middle part of the body of a Fly, and is seated a little beyond the center of gravity in the body towards the head, but that Excentricly is curiously balanc'd; first, by the expanded Area of the wings which lies all more backwards then the root, by the motion of them, whereby the center of their vibration is much more backwards towards the tail of the Fly then the <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> is. What the vibrative motion of the wings is, and after what manner they are moved, I have endeavoured by many trials to find out: And first for the manner of their motion, I endeavoured to observe several of those kind of small Spinning Flies, which will naturally suspend themselves, as it were, pois'd and steady in one place of the air, without rising or falling, or moving forwards or backwards; for by looking down on those, I could by a kind of faint shadow, perceive the utmost extremes of the vibrative motion of their wings, which shadow, whil'st they so endeavoured to suspend themselves, was not very long, but when they endeavour'd to flie forwards, it was somewhat longer; next, I tried it, by fixing the leggs of a Fly upon the top of the stalk of a feather, with Glew, Wax, &c. and then making it endeavour to flie away; for being thereby able to view it in any posture, I collected that the motion of the wing was after this manner. The extreme limits of the vibrations were usually somewhat about the length of the body distant from one another, oftentimes shorter, and sometimes also longer; that the formost limit was usually a little above the back, and the hinder somwhat beneath the belly; between which two limits, if one may ghess by the sound, the wing seem'd to be mov'd forwards and backwards with an equal velocity: And if one may (from the shadow or faint representation the wings afforded, and from the consideration {{of the nature of the}} thing) ghess at the posture or manner of the wings moving between them, it seem'd to be this: The wing being suppos'd placed in the upmost limit, seems to be put so that the plain of it lies almost horizontal, but onely the forepart does dip a little, or is somewhat more deprest; in this position is the wing vibrated or mov'd to the lower limit, being almost arrived at the lower limit, the hinder part of the wing moving somewhat faster then the former, the Area, of the wing begins to dip behind, and in that posture seems it to be mov'd to the upper limit back again, and thence back again in the first posture, the former part of the Area dipping again, as it is moved downwards by means of the quicker motion of the main stem which terminates or edges the forepart of the wing. And these vibrations or motions to and fro between the two limits seem so swift, that 'tis very probable (from the sound it affords, if it be compar'd with the vibration of a musical string, tun'd unison to it) it makes many hundreds, if not some thousands of vibrations in a second minute of time. And, if we may be allow'd to ghess by the sound, the wing of a Bee is yet more swift, for the tone is much more acute, and that, in all likelihood, proceeds from the exceeding swift beating of the air by the small wing. And it seems the more likely too, because the wing of a Bee is less in proportion to its body, then the other wing to the body of a Fly; so that for ought I know, it may be one of the quickest vibrating spontaneous motions of any in the world; and though perhaps there may be many Flies in other places that afford a yet more shrill note with their wings, yet 'tis most probable that the quickest vibrating spontaneous motion is to be found in the wing of some creature. Now, if we consider the exceeding quickness of these Animal spirits that must cause these motions, we cannot chuse but admire the exceeding vividness of the governing faculty or Anima of the Insect, which is able to dispose and regulate so the the motive faculties, as to cause every peculiar organ, not onely to move or act so quick, but to do it also so regularly.|$|E

50|$|In aerodynamics, {{angle of}} attack {{specifies}} the angle between the chord line of the wing of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vector representing the relative motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere. Since a wing can have twist, a chord line of the whole wing may not be definable, so an alternate reference line is simply defined.

50|$|The D.II was {{the only}} fighter built by Naglo but it was {{designed}} by Ing. Gnädig, {{who at the time}} was an employee of Albatros Flugzeugwerke and it partly reflected their practice. It was, though, one of the few quadruplanes of World War I. The three upper wings were all similar, having constant chord, squared tips, no sweep and the same span. The lowest of these was attached to the lower fuselage, the middle one to the upper fuselage with a cutout for downward vision. Inboard N-form interplane struts held the upper plane high over the fuselage in place of a cabane. Outboard there was one more N-interplane strut between each wing, four in all. Ailerons were fitted on all three upper wings. The fourth wing, lowest of all, was quite different, much shorter in span. It was mounted independently of the other three, fixed to a dorsal keel extension and braced on each side with a V-strut from about mid-span to the <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> above.

However, in this case the generated thrust is either very small, or even negative, depending on the wing shape. Further, results show that morphing of the wing enables {{a significant increase in the}} thrust and propulsive efficiency. This indicates that the birds actually utilize some sort of active wing twisting and bending to produce enough thrust.

40|$|Volumetric three-component {{velocimetry}} measurements {{have been}} performed on low aspect ratio wings subjected to a small amplitude pure plunging motion. The paper focuses on the near surface vortex flows generated by rectangular and elliptical wings set to a fixed geometric angle of attack of α = 20 °. The highly three-dimensional leading edge vortex structure is shown to be highly dependent on the oscillating frequency. A comparison with computational results shows good agreement, both demonstrating reorientation of the leading edge vortex filament. At low frequencies the vortex evolves quickly into an arch-type structure with an anchor point that progressively moves from the tip to the <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> At larger frequencies, this anchor point is forced to remain closer to the tip. The study elucidates that the deformation of the leading edge vortex is significantly influenced by planform shape, creating large undulations along the span of the elliptical wing. At a sufficiently high Strouhal number a tip vortex ring may develop causing a spanwise expansion of the vortex system. The complex interaction of these 3 D unsteady vortex structures is characteristic of oscillating low aspect ratio wings...|$|E

40|$|Civil {{transport}} aircraft {{is used for}} ferrying passengers {{from one place to}} another. Aircraft is a highly complex flying structure. Generally {{transport aircraft}} undergoes nominal maneuring flights. During the flight when the maximum lift is generated, the wings of the aircraft will undergo highest bending moment. The bending moment will be maximum at the <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> which caused highest stress at this location. Wings are attached to the fuselage structure through wing-fuselage attachment brackets. The bending moment and shear loads from the wing are transferred to the fuselage through the attachment joints. In this project bending load transfer joint is considered for the analysis. First one needs to ensure the static load carrying capability of the wing-fuselage attachment bracket. Stress analysis will be carried out for the given geometry of the wing-fuselage attachment bracket. Finite element method is used for the stress analysis. In the current project, an attempt will be made to predict the fatigue life of wing-fuselage attachment bracket in a transport airframe. In a metallic structure fatigue manifests itself {{in the form of a}} crack which propagates. Fatigue cracks will appear at the location of high tensile stress locations.

40|$|The {{fracture}} {{process in}} heterogeneous materials (e. g., concrete, rock, aggregate composites) under uniaxial compression proceeds {{in three stages}} differing in the scale levels involved. Stage 1 is the accumulation of wing cracks formed under compression from pre-existing defects. The wing cracks themselves cannot grow to an extent sufficient to cause failure. However, they produce an additional self-equilibrating and, in general, spatially random stress field. Therefore, some places {{can be found in}} the sample subjected to tensile stress components acting in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the applied compression and hence not getting suppressed by it. The magnitude of these tensile stresses increases as a square <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> crack concentration and, as the wing cracks accumulate, becomes sufficient to produce new tensile fractures. This starts Stage 2 in which these tensile fractures grow in a stable manner parallel to the direction of compression and become mesocracks (i. e., their sizes are now larger than the ones of the wing cracks, but still small compared to the sample dimensions). It is assumed that meso cracks grow in such a way to avoid wing cracks. Thus, the mean value of the part of the wing crack-produced random stress field that affects each mesocrack is positive (tensile), which eventually initiates the unstable grows of meso cracks and causes failure. This constitutes Stage 3 of the fracture process. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Estimation of {{the choice}} impact of {{statistics}} data at {{the phase of}} conceptual design settings for unmanned aerial vehicle. The article is dedicated to analyzing the usage of composite technologies {{in the construction of}} unmanned aircraft. There were examined the modern construction technologies and were compared to technologies that underpin statistical material. Currently, in methodological literature there were given an example of relative weight of aircraft parts that were built based on outdated technology. Nowadays, UAVs are built on modern technologies with composite materials as a result the relative weight parts of the UAV need a recalculation. Consequently, having used the collected statistical database of existing UAVs, with mass characteristics of each unit the relative weight of the UAV airframe parts have been calculated in analytical method. After analyzing the results, we can see the redistribution of relative masses in toward increasing the mass of the payload (up to 68 %), a significant decrease in the mass of individual units UAV. The project criteria of the useful to takeoff load ratio that describes the payload UAV was totally researched in the article. In analyzing the characteristic dependences there were found the factor of increasing influence of take-off weight and increasing the coefficient of mass return. This is due to the possibility of usage the necessary concrete section of power elements, rather than constructively or technologically based on. With the increasing of aerodynamic quality the useful to takeoff load ratio decreases, {{this is due to the}} necessity of improvements of the aircraft aerodynamic efficiency, which inevitably leads to augmentation weight of airframe. With the increasing of aspect ratio of wing the useful to takeoff load ratio is reduced. This is caused by increasing of bending moment at the <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> and the necessity to strengthen this node, thus the mass of the aircraft is increased.

40|$|Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) are {{a critical}} component of many military operations. Over the last few decades, <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> UAVs has given rise to increasingly smaller aircraft. Along with <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> smaller UAVs, termed mini UAVs, has come issues involving <b>the</b> endurance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. Endurance in mini UAVs is problematic because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limited size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuel systems that can be incorporated into the aircraft. A large portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total mass <b>of</b> many electric powered mini UAVs, for example, is the rechargeable battery power source.

AMR BAZ (ref l) details the work in which SMA is embedded in sleeves located at the neutral planes and arranged parallel to the longitudinal axis of the composite beam. Here {{emphasis is placed on}} describing quasi-static theory of shape control and implementation of this theory to composites incorporated with SMA. Emphasis has been placed on full utilization of shape memory effect without compromising on structural stiffness of the composite beam. Koryo Miura et a 1 (ref. 2) explain about adaptive structures and their use in aerospace applications. Here a variable geometry (VG) truss concept is presented. Comparison is made between tetrahedral and octahedral truss elements. Since octahedral is richer in symmetry, it is considered to be adequate for adaptive structures. DC motor is used as an actuator. It is shown that VG truss is the basic form of adaptive structures. The basic formulations for its geometrical as well as vibrational properties are established. Some applications such as second generation manipulator arm, support architecture for a space station and others are discussed here. Deepak. S. Ramrakhyani et a 1 (ref. 3) explains about the use of compliant cellular truss where tendons are used as active elements. This tendon actuated elements can be used for local or global shape changes. Here an octahedral unit cell is developed for bending deformations and compliant joints are made of cylindrical elements of superelastic shape memory alloys. Several concepts of morphing skin were also presented. Tendon actuators are presently under development. The tendons could be actuated locally or combined from a remote location such as the <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> Since we are looking for large deflection of thin beams we have deliberately embedded the SMA wires off the neutral axis of the beam. In the literatures there is hardly any material that deals with this type of an approach. In this the effect of embedding the thermal SMA wires off the neutral plane of thin beams was studied. These wires were prestrained and embedded off the neutral axis to produce high amount of recovery forces when electrically energized. Superelastic SMA (SESMA) wires were used {{on the other side of}} the beam so as to increase the spring back effect of the beam when de-energized. Thus we were able to obtain large deflection together with faster return back to original position when de-energized...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{illustrate}} a new wing morphing concept and to compare its performance with the conventional wing-flap configuration. While there is no formal definition for the word "morphing", it is usually considered to mean large shape change or transfiguration. In the field of aeronautics, "shape morphing" {{has been used to}} identify those aircraft that undergo significant geometrical changes to enhance or adapt to their mission profiles. This investigation aims {{to find out more about}} non conventional solutions over the classical wing structural design. The main goal in this research is to replace the ordinary wing structure adopted on a model aircraft with a new morphing wing. In this way, aerodynamic performances during different flight conditions may be improved thanks to the prevention of typical aerodynamic losses caused by geometrical discontinuities in conventional designs. The ability of a wing surface to change its geometry during flight has interested researchers and designers over the years as this reduces the design compromises required. Conventional flap systems inevitably contain discontinuous sections that cause aerodynamic losses, and this is the point where using a morphing technology that would prevent those aerodynamic losses makes sense. Wing morphing concepts can be classified into three major shape changing types: planform alternation, out-of-plane transformation, and airfoil adjustment. An example of planform alteration is wing span resizing through telescopic structures. The morphing wing in the telescopic designs is sectioned longitudinally to form several segments with reducing cross sectional area, such that each segment can be accommodated in the adjacent inner segment with a minimum sliding clearance. Given the required length change, the number of segments can be determined. Neal et al. designed and demonstrated a variable planform aircraft capable of such wing span resizing. Airfoil profile adjustment has been the less explored way of morphing. Austin et al. examined variable length trusses to reshape the airfoil. They attached linear displacement actuators inside the wing section in a diagonal manner. The airfoil shape could therefore be modified by the expansion or contraction of the actuators. Although the idea of changing the wing camber was born with the first airplanes, it is far from simple to design devices capable of achieving the necessary deformation and suitable control systems. Airfoil adjustment is mainly concerned with camber variation, although there is also some research concerned with thickness change. In this research, a new morphing mechanism using rapidly prototyped structural elements and a bio-inspired geometry is proposed to perform an out of plane transformation through profile chord wise bending. A rotating mechanism created by means of a rod connected to a linear actuator positioned at the <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing,</b> led each rib to de ect at least up to 40 degrees.

In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swept-back <b>wing</b> <b>the</b> pressure distributions remain qualitatively similar at subsonic and supersonic speeds. Thus a distribution similar to <b>the</b> Ackeret type <b>of</b> distribution appears on <b>the</b> <b>root</b> sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swept-back <b>wing</b> at Mach= 0. The resulting positive pressure drag on the root section is balanced by negative drags on outboard sections...|$|R
40|$|Tests {{were made}} in the NACA gust tunnel to {{determine}} <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> a torsionally flexible <b>wing</b> with <b>the</b> torsion axis ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> section aerodynamic centers in reducing airplane accelerations due to atmospheric gusts. For three gust shapes, a series of flights was made with the airplane model equipped with either a torsionally flexible or a rigid <b>wing.</b> <b>The</b> results indicated that <b>the</b> torsionally flexible <b>wing</b> reduced <b>the</b> maximum acceleration increment 5 percent for the sharp-edge gust and about 17 percent for gust shapes with gradient distances of 6. 8 and 15 chord lengths. The analysis indicated that <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> this method of gust alleviation was independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gust velocity and that, for the same total load increment, <b>the</b> torsionally flexible <b>wing</b> would have 10 percent less bending-moment increment at <b>the</b> <b>root</b> section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> than a rigid wing in all but the sharpest gusts. The results also indicated that <b>the</b> torsionally flexible <b>wing</b> slightly increased <b>the</b> longitudinal stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airplane model in a gust...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{aeroelastic}} model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing/engine system <b>of</b> a large {{commercial aircraft}} is established. Taking {{into account the}} engine inertia force and thrust, static aeroelastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> structure and load distributions including shear force, bending moment and torque are studied. Models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clean <b>wing</b> and <b>the</b> wing/engine system are compared and effects of chordwise and spanwise locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing-mounted engines on <b>the</b> <b>wing's</b> natural vibration and flutter characteristics are analyzed. The research indicates that the bending moment at <b>the</b> <b>root</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> is alleviated by the engine, and <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine inertia force and thrust will change the torque there remarkably, while not affect the bending and torsion deformations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> structure much. <b>The</b> results also show that wing-mounted engines will affect <b>the</b> <b>wing's</b> natural frequency <b>of</b> vibration, consequently having great effects on <b>the</b> flutter characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> Besides <b>the</b> classic <b>wing</b> flutter induced by <b>the</b> coupling <b>of</b> bending and torsion modes, a low-damping flutter type appears from <b>the</b> coupling <b>of</b> engine-pitch mode and the bending and torsion modes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> Variations in chordwise and spanwise position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing-mounted engines will change <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine-pitch mode, and further affect the low-damping flutter characteristics mentioned above, to which much attention should be paid in engineering application...|$|R
40|$|The paper shows {{preliminary}} results of aeroelastic analyses of two half-wing models, having curved and swept planform, {{carried out at}} <b>the</b> Aerospace Section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Civil and Industrial Engineering <b>of</b> Pisa University. <b>The</b> curved planform causes a variable angle <b>of</b> sweep along <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> span, so, as demonstrated in previous papers regarding rigid models <b>of</b> <b>wings,</b> in <b>the</b> transonic flight conditions wave drag effects are strongly reduced. The present numerical comparison, between curved and traditional swept <b>wing,</b> includes <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> structure’s deformability (<b>the</b> <b>wings</b> have <b>the</b> same aspect ratio). <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planform shape on drag polar curves are confirmed (for fixed values of Lift Coefficient (CL) <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> Drag Coefficient (CD) reaches 7 %- 10 %). Moreover the curved planform configuration improves <b>the</b> <b>wing’s</b> aeroelastic behavior: in the paper some results obtained by using Star-CCM+® 6. 04. 14 and Abaqus® 6. 11 in “co-simulation” are summarized. As an example, adopting similar wing box metallic structures for the two half-wing models, for a fixed value <b>of</b> CL <b>the</b> reaction moments and stress values at <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curved <b>wing</b> are reduced by about 5 ÷ 8 % with respect the data obtained for <b>the</b> traditional swept <b>wing</b> at <b>the</b> same flight conditions...|$|R

Agreement regarding static longitudinal stability {{as indicated by the}} elevator-fixed neutral points and by <b>the</b> variation <b>of</b> elevator deflection in both straight and turning flight was found to be good except at speeds approaching the stall. At these low speeds the airplane possessed noticeably improved stability, which was attributed to pronounced stalling at <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production <b>wing.</b> <b>The</b> pronounced root stalling did not occur on the smooth, well-faired model wing. Elevator tab effectiveness determined from model tests agreed well with flight-test tab effectiveness, but control-force variations with speed and acceleration were not in good agreement. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> model hinge-moment data obtained at zero sideslip appeared to be satisfactory for <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> aileron forces in sideslip. Fairly good correlation in aileron effectiveness and control forces was obtained; fabric distortion may have been responsible to some extent for higher flight values of aileron force at high speeds. Estimation of sideslip developed in an abrupt aileron roll was fair, but determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rudder deflection required to maintain zero sideslip in a rapid aileron roll was not entirely satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made in}} the Cal Tech-Merrill low speed wind tunnel at Pasadena City College to determine the lift and moment characteristics of a sweptback wing and a comparable delta wing, both with a 65 ° sweptback leading edge and a double wedge symmetrical airfoil section. Both wings were tested with and without a fuselage. Leading edge flaps and slats, trailing edge plain flaps, split flaps, Fowler type flaps, and fillets were tried to determine their effects on these characteristics. The complete airplane was designed with the idea that it should be a tailless airplane. 	 The results showed unfavorable longitudinal static stability characteristics which could be improved but which could never be completely overcome at the stall when <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> were tested with the fuselage. A horizontal tail surface was necessary for longitudinal static stability at the stall but proved ineffective at <b>the</b> lower angles <b>of</b> attack. <b>The</b> maximum lift coefficients for both wings of about 1. 3 were higher than for a two dimensional double wedge airfoil section of approximately 0. 8. <b>The</b> angles <b>of</b> attack at which these were reached were about twice as high as for the two dimensional section. Tuft surveys showed <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> two strong vortices from <b>the</b> leading edge <b>of</b> both wings first appearing at an angle of attack of approximately 10 °. These vortices separated from <b>the</b> upper surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> before reaching <b>the</b> trailing edge. Comparison <b>of</b> results for <b>the</b> two <b>wings</b> indicated that <b>the</b> discontinuity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trailing edge at <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sweptback <b>wing</b> was detrimental to the maximum lift. There was an optimum deflection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trailing edge split flap as a high lift device. On <b>the</b> delta <b>wing</b> alone <b>the</b> plain flaps were very effective in increasing the maximum lift while the split flaps were ineffective. Ailerons on <b>the</b> sweptback <b>wing</b> wore effective at all angles <b>of</b> attack through <b>the</b> stall...|$|R
