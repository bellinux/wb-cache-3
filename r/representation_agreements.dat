Three groups of individuals were interviewed: capable <b>representation</b> <b>agreement</b> holders (n= 48), representatives of capable agreement holders (n= 38), and representatives of agreement holders no longer capable (n= 7). Study participants differed from the general population of seniors in BC in terms of income and education but were similar to those using advance care planning tools in the United States. The data revealed interesting gender differences suggesting that men and women may enter into agreements for different reasons and have dissimilar expectations of how their wishes are to be carried out.

40|$|On several {{occasion}} the European Commission {{has come}} to examine reciprocal <b>representation</b> <b>agreements</b> under which the national collecting societies typically mandate to one another the management of their own repertories. Although it has not questioned {{the validity of the}} whole <b>representation</b> <b>agreements,</b> the Commission’s intervention highlighted the anti-competitive nature of the clauses and of the conclusive conduct aimed at preserving the existence of territorial barriers within the market and, therefore the existence of national monopolies which appeared to be no longer justifiable in light of the cross-border circulation of intellectual property and the new technologies that enable the remote monitoring of the actual use of said works. The CISAC case is particularly interesting because the General Court has partially reversed the Commission’s finding of art. 101 TFEU infringement by holding that collecting societies’ parallel conduct, allegedly aimed at partitioning the market, was not a concerted practice as it was justified by reasons related to a better enforcement of rights on a local level...|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of music rights is currently {{carried out in}} a collective manner, by national organisations known as collecting societies. These organisations issue licences to commercial users, monitor their uses, collect royalties and distribute remuneration to rights holders. Collecting societies emerged {{as a response to}} the difficulty for authors to authorise personally every use of their work. They subsequently evolved into large and highly structured institutions that aggregate the interests of a wide and scattered array of rights holders. Collecting societies perform their activities within their national boundaries, as enforcers of territorial entitlements granted under copyright or droit d’auteur legislation. Cooperation between them has led to the establishment of a valuable network of reciprocal <b>representation</b> <b>agreements</b> for the exploitation of foreign repertoires. It is submitted, however, that the territorial connotation of collecting societies’ activities does not match the borderless character of music uses taking place via the internet. Technological and business solutions are open to cross-border uses but even such solutions still rely, to a large extent, on territorial licensing practices. It has been argued that this is an obstacle to the full development of online music services in the European Union. The problem for music rights management lies in the response to calls for new licensing models to arise, and in the challenge that such a response could bring to the existence of collecting societies. The query that this thesis tackles is whether the problem can be resolved via copyright instruments, or whether strategies based on competition are required to drive the market towards the desired outcome. It is observed that, in order to adapt to the changed environment, collecting societies have updated their reciprocal <b>representation</b> <b>agreements</b> to fit internet uses. The results of this process of adaptation have mostly been unsuccessful, due to their incompatibility with competition rules. Other models have been proposed, which envisage the elimination of reciprocal <b>representation</b> <b>agreements</b> and the implementation of mono-repertoire multi-territorial licences. These models also raise anti-competitive concerns. This study shows that the preferred solution to the defined problem is to be found in the assessment of rights management institutions from the point of view of the law and economics analysis, and more specifically through the lens of Industrial Organisation theories. The assessment conducted according to this approach highlights the strategic interactions in which rights managers engage, and demonstrates that multi-territorial licensing solutions now adopted for the internet function as by two-sided platforms competing in a market that remains highly concentrated.
