25|$|Prior to the ban, {{asbestos}} {{was widely}} used {{in the construction industry}} in thousands of materials. Some are judged to be more dangerous than others due to the amount of asbestos and the material's friable nature. Sprayed coatings, pipe insulation and Asbestos Insulating Board (AIB) are thought to be the most dangerous due to their high content of asbestos and friable nature. Many older buildings built before the late 1990s contain asbestos. In the United States, there is a minimum standard for asbestos surveys as described by ASTM Standard E 2356–04. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency includes some but not all asbestos-contaminated facilities on the Superfund National Priorities list (NPL). Renovation and demolition of asbestos contaminated buildings is subject to EPA NESHAP and OSHA Regulations. Asbestos is not a material covered under CERCLA's innocent purchaser defense. In the UK, the <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> <b>disposal</b> of asbestos and of substances containing it are covered by the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 February 1930, Thiepval was {{on patrol}} when she struck an uncharted {{rock in the}} Broken Islands of Barkley Sound on British Columbia's coast. Because the vessel had come to rest on a rock ledge, there was some hope {{that she could be}} salvaged, and Armentières came to the ship's assistance. The damage proved too great, however, and she sank the {{following}} day in the channel that now bears her name. In 1962, three years after the wreck had been located, divers recovered Thiepvals deck gun, which is now displayed in the fishing village of Ucluelet. Lying in just [...] of water, the wreck is accessible to sport divers and has become a popular dive site. In 1970, the wreck was made a part of Parks Canada's Pacific Rim National Park Reserve as a Shipwreck of National Historical Significance. In 2011, the Department of National Defence organized a survey of the wreck site following reports of unexploded munitions being seen by divers. In March 2017, The Royal Canadian Navy sent divers to conduct a survey of the wreck and develop a plan to remove the unexploded munitions. <b>Removal</b> <b>and</b> <b>disposal</b> of the unexploded ordnance is expected to occur during the summer of 2017.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{describe}} effective legislation that regulates collecting fees for <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> other <b>disposal</b> of municipal waste organised by municipalities. There are used also various socioeconomic approaches and the thesis seeks for the best solution how to collect the fees for the service. The study is mainly focused on Municipal Fees Act and its regulations because they cause most of problems in practice. Author's opinion is that such a regulation is completely wrong. According to {{the author of the}} thesis, there were found features of The Tragedy of the Commons theory in the regulations which means in practice that the whole system is going to either collapse or cost even more money to be kept. The next negative of the legislation is the possibility to circumvent paying the fees. Then, it was proved in the study that the main principle which is the legislation built on, does not work in practice. The principle is that costs paid for the <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> other <b>disposal</b> of municipal waste are supposed to be equivalent to a number of inhabitants living in a town.

40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) Hanford site 327 Building, {{built in}} 1953, {{played a key}} role in reactor {{material}} and fuel research programs. The facility includes nine shielded hot cells, a fuel storage basin, dry sample storage, and a large inerted hot (SERF) cell. In 1996, the 327 Building was transferred from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to Fluor Hanford, Inc., to begin the transition from the mission of irradiated fuel examination to stabilization and deactivation. In 2001, a multi-contractor team conducted a review of the concept of intact (one piece) <b>removal,</b> packaging, <b>and</b> <b>disposal</b> of the 327 hot cells. This paper focuses on challenges related to preparing the 327 Building hot cells for intact one-piece disposal as Low Level Waste (LLW) at the Hanford Site. These challenges, described in this paper, are threefold and include: Sampling and characterization of the cells for low level waste designation; Packaging of the cells for transportation and waste disposal; Transportation from the facility to the disposal site. The primary technical challenges in one-piece <b>removal,</b> packaging, <b>and</b> <b>disposal</b> of the hot cells involve the techniques required to characterize, remove, handle, package and transport a large (approximately up to 12 -feet long and 8 -feet high) contaminated object that weighs 35 to 160 tons. Specific characterization results associated with two hot cells, G and H cells will be reported. A review of the activities and plans to stabilize and deactivate the 327 Building provides insight into the technical challenges faced by this project and identifies a potential opportunity to modify the baseline strategy by removing the hot cells in one piece instead of decontaminating and dismantling the cells...|$|R
