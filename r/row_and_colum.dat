40|$|We {{identify}} an im ortant {{class of}} symmetries in constraint programming, arising from matrices of decision variables where rows and columns can be swapped. Whilst lexicographically ordering the rows (columns) breaks all the row (colum n) symmetries, lexicographically ordering both the rows and the colum' fails to break all the com {{positions of the}} <b>row</b> <b>and</b> <b>colum</b> n sym m etries. Nevertheless, our experim ental results show that this is effective at dealing with thesecom ositions of symR 9 RP es. We extend these results to cope with sym 4 G 6 P es in any num ber of dimM sions, with partial symC 4 ries, and with sym 6 R ric values. Finally, we identify special cases where all com ositions of the <b>row</b> <b>and</b> <b>colum</b> symCM ries can beelim' ated {{by the addition of}} only a linear num ber of symmetry-breaking constraints...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{combinatorial}} optimization problems arise in many circumstances, {{and we need}} to be able to solve these problems e ciently. Unfortunately, many of these problems are proven to be NP-hard, but problems can be related in some way. Analysing di erent combinatorial problems we can see some similarities between them. If we work with this similarities, we could improve the search process of an algorithm, because there exists some concurrent knowledge about solving a problem that could be exploited. For example, if an algorithm can solve an instance X for Sudoku puzzle ensuring uniqueness in blocks before <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>colums,</b> this strategy can be useful for another instance Y when the algorithm is in a local optimum. In other words, some heuristics that can nd interesting candidate solutions can be reused in future during the execution of an algorithm. To do this, an algorithm should learn over time to determine how, when and which heuristic apply. The idea of this investigation is to create strategies to design life-long learning heuristic based algorithms. There have been some investigations in this area applied to 1 -D Bin Packing problem, for Traveling Sales Problem and the most important thing, is that can be applied in different kinds of problem.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{properties}} of polarized electron beams are investigated {{in view of}} an application to polarized beta-rays emitted from nuclei with aligned spins. The state of polarization of electron beams, polarized or unpolarized, can be characterized by a density matrix ρ with two <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>colums</b> õ = (ρ 11 ρ 12 ρ 21 ρ 22), for a certain pair of fundamental (orthogonal) states (ψ 1, ψ 2), which serve to characterize the spin orientation. As orientation coefficient with respect to (ψ 1, ψ 2) we define P (ψ 1, ψ 2) = ρ 11 - ρ 22; the degree of polarization is defined as P = | P (ψ 1, ψ 2) | if ρ is in diagonal form for the basis (ψ 1, ψ 2). It is proved that scattering experiments can give an observation of P (ψ 1, ψ 2) for certain pairs of fundamental states (ψ 1, ψ 2). In a single-scattering experiment of an entirely polarized beam we give the intensity ratio of two beams in opposite directions, obtained after scattering over a right angle by (1 + a) /(1 - a). The intensity ratio of the final beams (in opposite directions) in a double-scattering experiment of an unpolarized beam is written as (1 + δ) /(1 - δ). It is shown {{that we have the}} relation a 2 = δ. Further it is found that in order to determine completely the polarization of a beam the determination of three independent orientation coefficients is necessary. The polarizations of light and of electron beams have been compared...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the decisive}} {{influence}} of the carbide distribution on the mechanical properties of high speed steels its estimation {{is an important step}} of steel quality inspection. Currently metallographers classify the distributions by assigning micrographs to a standard chart consisting of 28 reference images arranged in 4 <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> 7 <b>colums.</b> These classifications as well as the standard chart itself are not based on quantitative measures but on the qualitative visual impression of the metallographers. We present image analysis methods, which model the visual classification process. Apart from various features, which reflect parameters used in the visual decision process, additional features are extracted in frequency domain to improve the automatic classification. First promising results of classification experiments based on these quantitative features are discussed and a prototype of an `active inspection system' for fully-automatic steel specimen classification using the described met [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Convergence of the Iterative Proportional Fitting {{procedure}} is analyzed. The input comprises a nonnegative weight matrix, and positive target marginals for <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> columns. The output sought {{is what is}} called the biproportional fit, a scaling of the input weight matrix by means of <b>row</b> <b>and</b> column divisors so as to equate <b>row</b> <b>and</b> column sums to target marginals. The procedure alternates between the fitting of <b>rows,</b> <b>and</b> the fitting of columns. We monitor progress with an L 1 -error function measuring the distance between current <b>row</b> <b>and</b> column sums <b>and</b> target <b>row</b> <b>and</b> column marginals. The procedure converges to the biproportional fit if and only if the L 1 -error tends zero. In case of non-convergence the procedure appears to oscillate between two accumulation points. The oscillation result is contingent on the "IPF conjecture" that <b>row</b> <b>and</b> column divisors are always convergent. The conjecture is established in the specific case when the even-step subsequence admits an accumulation point that is connected, but remains open in general...|$|R
