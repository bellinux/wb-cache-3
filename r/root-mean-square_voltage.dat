The experiments on recording of partial discharges in transformer oil {{have been carried out}} in the “point-plane” electrode system at alternating current. The instantaneous voltage and the apparent charge have been measured depending on the <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage</b> and the phase angle of partial discharges. This paper aimes at carrying out a statistical analysis of the obtained experimental results, in particular, the construction of a parametric probabilistic model of the dependence of the partial discharge inception voltage distribution on the value of the <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage.</b> It differs from usual discharges which occur in liquid dielectric materials in case of sharp inhomogeneous electrode system.

The study aims to investigate the effect of aldosterone antagonists on the P-wave SAECG in patients with paroxysmal AF. Material and methods. The study included 58 patients with coronary heart disease and compensated chronic heart failure with preserved left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction ≥ 45 %) who had a history of paroxysmal AF and sinus rhythm at baseline. All patients received ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, statins, antithrombotic and antiarrhythmic drugs and were randomly assigned to either standart therapy only (control group, 30 patients) or aldosterone antagonist spironolactone 25 mg (spironolactone group, 28 patients) added to standart treatment. The SAECG was obtained at sinus rhythm at the baseline and after 6 months treatment. The atrial late potentials (ALP) were defined as total filtered P-wave duration of ≥ 125 ms and a <b>root-mean-squared</b> <b>voltage</b> of the terminal 20 ms of ≤ 3. 5 μV. The AF recurrence rate during 6 months was measured. Results. At the baseline ALP were found in 25 (83 %) patients of the control group and in 24 (86 %) patients of the spironolactone group (р= 0. 977). After 6 months treatment the ALP rate was significantly decreased in the spironolactone group (57 %, χ 2 = 4. 27, р= 0. 03 compared to the baseline) but remained high in control (80 %, χ 2 = 0. 00; р= 1. 0). During 6 months AF recurrences were documented in 5 (18 %) participants of the spironolactone group and in 14 (47 %) patients of the control one (χ 2 = 4. 23; р= 0. 04).

The measurement uncertainty of the stochastic sampling method is analysed and the influence of dominant factors is quantitatively derived. Special consideration is given to the influence of dispersion of A/D converter outputs and the waveforms of the two input signals as contributors to the measurement uncertainty.

40|$|Abstract—The {{proposed}} {{line voltage}} recovery (LVR) {{and the total}} harmonic distortion improvement (THDI) technique improve power factor (PF) and total harmonic distortion (THD) over a wide line voltage range in boundary conduction mode controlled power factor corrector (PFC). The LVR detects the input line <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage</b> to generate the digital equivalent code to the THDI for optimizing the THD by tuning the on-time value at different line voltages. In addition, the LVR and the THDI provide a feedforward path to reduce the ripple of the feedback voltage for further improving the THD. Therefore, the PFC controller can keep high PF and low THD over a wide line voltage. Experimental results demonstrate that the peak PF value is 0. 998 and the minimum THD is 1. 7 % by the test circuit fabricated in a TSMC 800 -V ultrahigh-voltage process with the universal line voltage range of 90 – 264 V.

A new power-quality (PQ) index is then proposed to combine the effects of voltage unbalance and harmonic distortions. This new index is easily implemented into existing electronic power meters. This PQ index is determined from the analysis of temperature rise in induction motor windings, which were tested for long periods of time. This paper also shows that these voltage disturbances, which are harmful to the lifetime expectancy of motors, can be measured by alternative ways in relation to conventional methods.

In patients with first acute myocardial infarction, filtered QRS duration was significantly shorter when treated with streptokinase (95 +/- 11 ms, n = 53) than when treated with conventional therapy (99 +/- 12 ms, n = 77, p < 0. 05). The low-amplitude signal (D 40) was shorter after thrombolysis (28 +/- 11 vs 33 +/- 12 ms, p < 0. 02).

Standard deviation of measured value over a specified measuring period is defined as an error. When finding expressions for the measured quantity and its error, time is treated as an independent uniform random variable; therefore, probability theory and statistical theory of samples can be applied.

The proportion (thermal transfer coefficient kp) of the arc energy leading to the pressure rise in the container is about 44. 9 %.

AMD was withdrawn at 24 h because of prolonged QTc interval (716 ms), which persisted {{for a further}} 48 h (661 ms). Ventricular premature contraction (VPC) was significantly decreased at 7 h; however, VPC increased again after discontinuing AMD.

We prospectively obtained SAECGs in 114 patients with dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Twelve-lead ECGs, left ventricular ejection fractions, hemodynamic measurements, and peak exercise oxygen consumption (Vo 2) also were measured. An SAECG was defined as abnormal by any one of the three following criteria: filtered QRS duration> 120 msec, <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage</b> in the last 40 msec 38 msec at 40 Hz.

The study examines the effects of dielectric material and thickness, applied voltage amplitude and frequency, voltage waveform, exposed electrode geometry, covered electrode width, and multiple actuator arrays. The metric used to evaluate the performance of the actuator in each case is the measured actuator-induced thrustwhich is proportional to the total body force. It is demonstrated that actuators constructedwith thick dielectric material of lowdielectric constant produce abody force that is an order ofmagnitude larger than that obtained by the Kapton-based actuators used inmanyprevious plasmaflow control studies.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{significant}} change in the power grid for the distribution of electrical energy have been observed. Thanks to liberalization of the electrical market and the incentives offered to the production of energy from renewable sources, the number of medium and small producers has increased. Moreover, with the development of communication technology, the transmission grid has been increasingly equipped with automated devices capable of monitoring and transmitting some information about the grid and, in some cases, to control the actuation devices connected to the grid itself. In this scenario, the term smart grid was born, used to describe energy networks that can automatically monitor energy flows and adjust to changes in energy supply and demand accordingly. When coupled with smart metering systems, smart grids reach consumers and suppliers by providing information on real-time consumption. As an example, consumers can adapt their energy usage to different energy prices throughout the day with personal smart meters, saving money on their energy bills by consuming more energy in lower price periods. As it can be expected, the wider the grid, the larger the number of smart meters required for its monitoring. However, deploying thousands of such devices turns rapidly to be too expensive. Consequently, the realization of the distributed measurement system could not be economically sustainable. To overcome the considered limitations, the research activities have been focused on the possibility to move towards a different approach for monitoring grid deployed on wide geographical areas, exploiting the advantages of an innovative acquisition paradigm: the Compressed Sampling (CS). CS is a signal processing technique for efficiently acquiring and reconstructing a signal from far fewer samples than those required by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem. In particular, the proposed architecture consists of low cost nodes mandated only to sample and digitize a limited number of input signal samples and transmit them to a central measurement unit, thus saving the costs related to large memory supports and expensive digital processing units. Once the samples are received, the central unit recovers the signal spectrum thanks to CS-based algorithm and carries out the desired measurements. Thanks to the CS-based approach, it is possible to design and realize a measurement node, characterized by reduced memory depth and only one ADC, suitable for poly-phase system with neutral wire that allows meeting the requirements of a distributed measurement system. Numerical and experimental test verified highlight the capability of CS-based acquisition approach of correctly measuring the <b>root-mean-square</b> amplitude of <b>voltage</b> waveforms and assuring simultaneous multi-channel acquisitions. Finally, the compliance of the measurement node based on CS approach with the current Power Quality standards is assessed and discussed...|$|R

In 7 patients with AF, these parameters were compared before and after the catheter ablation. The FPD was significantly longer and the RMS 20 was smaller in the patients with AF than those without AF. Because RMS 30 was widely distributed between 2 and 10 µV, the AF group was sub-divided into two groups; Group 1 was comprised of the patients with an RMS 30 ≧ 5. 0 µV, and group 2, < 5. 0 µV. In group 1, short-coupled PACs were more frequently documented on Holter monitoring, and exercise testing more readily induced AF. After successful electrical disconnection between the LA and PVs, each micropotential parameter was significantly attenuated. These results indicate that the high frequency signal amplitude of the last component of the P wave is relatively high in patients with AF triggered by focal repetitive excitations most likely originating from the PVs. That is, attenuation by the LA-PV electrical isolation, and thus the high frequency P signals of the last component, may contain the electrical excitation of the PV musculature...|$|E

For magnetic sensing, the sensor employs a magnetic–mechanical–piezoelectric configuration (which uses magnetic force and torque, a compact, single, mechanical mechanism, and the piezoelectric effect) to convert x-axis and y-axis in-plane and z-axis magnetic fields into piezoelectric voltage outputs. Under the x-axis magnetic field (sine-wave, 100 Hz, 0. 2 – 3. 2 gauss) and the z-axis magnetic field (sine-wave, 142 Hz, 0. 2 – 3. 2 gauss), the voltage output with {{the sensitivity of}} the sensor are 1. 13 – 26. 15 mV with 8. 79 mV/gauss and 1. 31 – 8. 92 mV with 2. 63 mV/gauss, respectively.

Fifteen patients presented with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (sustained ventricular arrhythmias), 23 with other minor arrhythmias. SAECG variables and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) were statistically correlated with the extent of myocardial fibrosis on biopsy in ARVC. An increased percentage of fibrous tissue (> or = 30 %) was a significant univariate predictor of late potentials (p = 0. 004) and reduced RVEF (p = 0. 02). The 18 patients with late potentials had an increased percentage of fibrous tissue (p = 0. 01), a reduced RVEF (p = 0. 0004), and a higher risk for sustained ventricular arrhythmias (p = 0. 05) than the 20 patients without late potentials.

Signal-averaged ECGs obtained at intervals of 16. 4 ± 22. 3 days were analyzed in the time domain before and after high pass filtering at 25 and 70 Hz. Frequency domain analysis was performed with use of a fast Fourier transform algorithm. Sixteen severe rejection episodes requiring treatment were observed. These episodes induced significant decreases in peak and root-mean-square voltages of both filtered and unfiltered QRS complexes, {{as well as in the}} total spectral area. Conversely, QRS duration and 50 - to 250 -Hz or 70 - to 110 -Hz spectral areas were not significantly altered. In 14 cases mild rejection episodes were observed that did not significantly alter any of the variables studied. The <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage</b> of the 70 -Hz high pass filtered QRS complex was found to be the most accurate variable in detecting rejection. Moreover, this variable was also the most reproducible in 10 healthy control subjects. The optimal rejection criterion was defined as an 11 % decrease in voltage between two consecutive recordings. It provided 87. 5 % sensitivity with 78. 4 % specificity. In conclusion, the signal-averaged ECG is helpful in the management of heart transplant rejection.

Here {{we report on}} experiments for CO 2 conversion {{by means of a}} cold atmospheric plasma using a cylindrical flowing dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. A detailed comparison of this DBD ignited in a so-called burst mode (i. e. where an AC voltage is applied during a limited amount of time) and pure AC mode is carried out to evaluate their effect on the conversion of CO 2 {{as well as on the}} energy efficiency. Decreasing the duty cycle in the burst mode from 100 % (i. e. corresponding to pure AC mode) to 40 % leads to a rise in the conversion from 16 - 26 % and to a rise in the energy efficiency from 15 to 23 %. Based on a detailed electrical analysis, we show that the conversion correlates with the features of the microfilaments. Moreover, the <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage</b> in the burst mode remains constant as a function of the process time for the duty cycles < 70 %, while a higher duty cycle or the usual pure AC mode leads to a clear voltage decay by more than 500 V, over approximately 90 s, before reaching a steady state regime. The higher plasma voltage in the burst mode yields a higher electric field. This causes the increasing the electron energy, and therefore their involvement in the CO 2 dissociation process, which is an additional explanation for the higher CO 2 conversion and energy efficiency in the burst mode.

METHODSTwenty-four post-Fontan patients and 15 age-matched healthy subjects were prospectively studied with PSAECG, and the following measurements were made: filtered P wave duration (FPWD), P wave vector integrals (PINTs), <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage</b> for the initial 30 ms (RMSi 30), and duration of persistent amplitude signals < 4 μV {{from the beginning of the}} P wave (Di 4). RESULTSThe FPWDs were significantly longer in the study group patients with ATs when compared with the study group patients without ATs (p < 0. 01) and compared with the controls (p < 0. 001). An FPWD cut point of 135 ms resulted in a sensitivity of 71 % and a specificity of 81 % in differentiating patients with ATs from patients without ATs among the postoperative Fontan patients. The PINT was significantly greater in Fontan patients with AFF and also without AFF when compared with controls (p < 0. 01, p < 0. 05, respectively). The RMSi 30 and the Di 4 were not significantly different between study and control groups. CONCLUSIONSSignal-averaged P wave duration is significantly prolonged in postoperative Fontan patients. A prolonged signal-averaged P wave duration may be an effective noninvasive marker to predict risk of development of ATs in this patient group...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} {{the link between the}} flow induced pressure fluctuations and atherosclerosis is reported in this thesis. A model of a C-shape tortuous channel was used to simulate a contorted cervical portion of the human internal carotid artery (ICA) and air was used as the flow medium. The experiment was carried out under steady flow conditions and pressure fluctuations at various positions along the wall of the ICA model were measured with a calibrated condenser microphone and a digital voltmeter. Dynamic similarity between air flow in the model and blood flow in the artery was scaled by the Reynolds number and characteristic frequencies of the pressure fluctuations scaled by the Strouhal number. A Fast Fourier Transform of the measured pressure fluctuations was performed {{with the aid of a}} Strobe Aquisition Unit and the resultant frequency spectra analysed. The <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage</b> of the dominant characteristic frequency of the fluctuating pressure was measured and converted to a fluctuating pressure coefficient. The overall results were presented as a map of pressure distribution at various positions on the model. A dominant characteristic frequency of 34 Hz, as well as periodic doubling and band-broadening were observed. The dominant characteristic frequency was found to increase with flowrate. These pressure fluctuations may be attributed to the inherant instability in the separation/reattachment shear layer. High amplitude and high frequency pressure fluctuations were found to occur at the proximity of the bends along the flow path and matched the clinically reported sites of atherosclerosis. It could therefore be inferred that flow induced pressure fluctuations influenced the initiation and perhaps the progression of atherosclerosis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCO 2 {{conversion}} into value-added products {{has gained}} significant interest over the few last years, as the greenhouse gas concentrations constantly increase due to anthropogenic activities. Here {{we report on}} experiments for CO 2 conversion {{by means of a}} cold atmospheric plasma using a cylindrical flowing dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. A detailed comparison of this DBD ignited in a so-called burst mode (i. e. where an AC voltage is applied during a limited amount of time) and pure AC mode is carried out to evaluate their effect on the conversion of CO 2 {{as well as on the}} energy efficiency. Decreasing the duty cycle in the burst mode from 100 % (i. e. corresponding to pure AC mode) to 40 % leads to a rise in the conversion from 16 – 26 % and to a rise in the energy efficiency from 15 to 23 %. Based on a detailed electrical analysis, we show that the conversion correlates with the features of the microfilaments. Moreover, the <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage</b> in the burst mode remains constant as a function of the process time for the duty cycles < 70 %, while a higher duty cycle or the usual pure AC mode leads to a clear voltage decay by more than 500 V, over approximately 90 s, before reaching a steady state regime. The higher plasma voltage in the burst mode yields a higher electric field. This causes the increasing the electron energy, and therefore their involvement in the CO 2 dissociation process, which is an additional explanation for the higher CO 2 conversion and energy efficiency in the burst mode...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the relation between signal-averaged electrocardiographic (ECG) variables {{and the extent of}} right ventricular disease, as estimated by right ventricular enlargement during detailed echocardiography, in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Background. In patients with ventricular tachycardia of right ventricular origin, a normal signal-averaged ECG is indicative of “idiopathic” ventricular tachycardia, whereas an abnormal signal-averaged ECG is a specific marker for right ventricular disease, especially dysplasia. Signal-averaged ECGs in these patients are mildly to grossly abnormal. Methods. Ten patients with the clinical diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia were included. All patients had documented, sustained ventricular tachycardia, no coronary artery disease and a normal QRS duration of ≤ 110 ms on routine 12 -lead electrocardiography. Signal-averaged ECGs were recorded using time-domain analysis. Right ventricular cavity dimensions recorded during two-dimensional echocardiography were measured {{at the level of the}} inflow tract, midcavity and outflow tract. Signal-averaged ECG variables and echocardiographic measurements were correlated using linear regression analysis. Results. Nine of 10 patients had abnormal signal-averaged ECGs. There was a consistent correlation between all signal-averaged ECG variables and the right ventricular cavity dimensions at the level of the midcavity. The correlation was most significant with the duration of the filtered QRS complex (p < 0. 001 for QRS duration, p < 0. 01 for late potential duration and p < 0. 05 for <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage</b> of the last 40 ms). There was no consistent correlation between the signal-averaged ECG variables and right ventricular dimensions at the level of the inflow and outflow tracts. Conclusions. The majority of patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia have abnormal signal-averaged ECGs. In the absence of bundle branch block, the extent of abnormality of signal-averaged ECG variables is in proportion to right ventricular cavity enlargement, and thus is indicative of the severity of right ventricular dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of action of moricizine, a new antiarrhythmic agent used in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial, is incompletely characterized. In addition, because moricizine is extensively metabolized, plasma moricizine concentration has an unknown relation to myocardial drug effect. Signal-averaged and standard electrocardiograms (ECGs) were used to monitor moricizine's myocardial effects in 16 patients with frequent ventricular premature complexes taking 600 to 900 mg daily. Three signal-averaged ECG variables were measured: total filtered QRS duration (fQRS), <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage</b> in the terminal 40 ms or the QRS complex (V 40) and the terminal low amplitude duration < 40 μV (LAS). At steady state, plasma samples were collected and serial recordings of signal-averaged and standard ECGs were taken at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after moricizine administration. A 24 h ambulatory ECG was recorded throughout the test period. Moricizine prolonged the fQRS (p < 0. 05) and decreased the V 40 (p < 0. 05) of the signal-averaged ECG and prolonged the QRS (p < 0. 05) and corrected JT (JTc) intervals (p < 0. 05) of the standard ECG. The time course of the signal-averaged and standard ECG variables paralleled plasma moricizine concentration; that is, the maximal changes occurred at 1 to 2 h and declined to time 0 values at 8 h. The maximal changes were: fQRS (+ 8 %), V 40 (− 33 %), QRS (+ 8 %) and JTc (+ 4 %). Thus, dynamic changes were observed for intraventricular conduction (fQRS, QRS) and ventricular repolarization (JTc) over the dosing interval. In a subset of seven patients with ≥ 6 ventricular premature complexes/h at steady state on moricizine, the frequency of ventricular premature complexes related inversely with plasma moricizine concentration and changes on the signal-averaged and standard ECGs. Noninvasive evaluation of moricizine provided insight into the relation between drug concentration and myocardial effect...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the ability of the signal-averaged {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) to predict the efficacy of procainamide. Background. The main role of the signal-averaged ECG has been the identification of postinfarction patients at risk of sudden death. Prediction of the efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs represents another potential clinical application of this technique. Methods. The study examined the effects of procainamide on the time domain and spectral temporal analysis of the signalaveraged ECG in relation to the results of programmed ventricular stimulation studies in 31 patients with inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Results. Procainamide significantly prolonged the total and the initial QRS complex and low amplitude signal durations (mean ± SD 135 ± 30 vs. 161 ± 46 ms, p < 0. 0001; 87 ± 16 vs. 98 ± 20 ms, p < 0. 0001, and 48 ± 23 vs. 63 ± 36 ms, p < 0. 001, respectively) whereas the <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage</b> of the total QRS complex and of the last 40 ms of the QRS complex was significantly reduced (mean ± SD 112 ± 36 vs. 87 ± 36 μV, p < 0. 0001; 21 ± 19 vs. 13 ± 12 μV, p < 0. 002, respectively). The results of spectral temporal mapping of the signal-averaged ECG were similar before and after procainamide administration. Procainamide prevented the inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia or prolonged the cycle length of ventricular tachycardia by ≥ 100 ms in 16 patients (52 %) (responders). The fractional prolongation of the total QRS duration was significantly greater in responders (26 ± 15 %) than in nonresponders (10 ± 10 %) (p < 0. 002) and, when this prolongation was ≥ 15 %, identified responders with a sensitivity of 94 %, a specificity of 87 % and an overall predictive accuracy of 90 %. Conclusions. The effects of procainamide on inducibility of ventricular tachycardia during programmed ventricular stimulation can be predicted by the degree of drug-induced prolongation of the signal-averaged QRS complex...|$|E
40|$|An AC {{voltmeter}} is {{a device}} that measures the (peak) oscillating current I 0 across a large resistor R 0 that is attached to leads whose tips, 1 and 2, may be connected to some other circuit. The reading of the voltmeter (if properly calibrated) is Vmeter = I 0 (R 0 + Rleads) where Rleads ≪ R 0. AC voltmeters typically report the <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage</b> Vrms = I 0 (R 0 + Rleads) / √ 2 rather than I 0 (R 0 + Rleads). Discuss {{the relation of the}} meter reading to the difference V 1 − V 2 in the scalar potential V between points 1 and 2, and to the line integral ∫ 2 1 E · dl along the circuit being probed, {{in the absence of the}} voltmeter. First consider “ordinary ” circuits operating at angular frequency ω for which: 1. The size of the circuit (and of the voltmeter leads) is small compared to the wavelength λ = 2 πc/ω, wherec is the speed of light. In this case there is no spatial variation to the current in any segment of a loop between two nodes; 2. Effects of wave propagation and radiation can be ignored; 3. Magnetic flux through the circuit is well localized in small inductors (coils). Then, consider cases in which these restrictions are relaxed. Show that while in general the meter reading is not equal to either V 1 − V 2 or ∫ 2 1 E · dl, to a good approximation the reading is ∫ 2 1 E · dl if the conditions 1 and 2 are satisfied, and to a similar approximation the reading is V 1 − V 2 if all three conditions are satisfied. 1 To give a well-defined meaning to the potentials, work in the Lorenz gauge [2] (and SI units) where the vector potential A(r,t) is related to the scalar potential V (r,t) b...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} signal-averaged electrocardiography and 24 -h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in 53 {{patients with}} myotonic dystrophy {{to determine the}} incidence and clinical significance of ventricular late potentials. Patients were followed up for a mean period of 31 ± 17 months (range 11 – 68 months). At entry, none of the patients had bundle branch block on 12 -lead electrocardiogram and none had wall motion abnormalities on routine echocardiogram. Also, no patient had history of syncope or clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease or a documented sustained ventricular tachycardia. A group of 47 healthy subjects matched for age and sex also underwent signal-averaged electrocardiography for comparison with the patient group. Late potentials were diagnosed {{in the presence of}} {{at least two of the}} following measures: duration of the filtered QRS > 114 ms, <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage</b> of the terminal 40 ms of the filtered QRS 38 ms. Late potentials were more frequent in patients than in controls: 18 of the 53 patients (34 %) showed late potentials compared with four of the 47 controls (8. 5 %) (P < 0. 01). In 45 patients (85 %) no ventricular ectopy (40 cases) or infrequent premature ventricular complexes (five cases) were detected on Holter monitoring. Complex ventricular arrhythmias were traced in the remaining eight patients. These were six of the 18 patients with, and two of the 45 patients without late potentials (33 % vs. 6 %, respectively; P < 0. 01). Only two of the eight patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias were documented to have repeated three-beat runs of ventricular tachycardia; both patients also had late potentials. During the period of observation there were no sudden deaths. Two patients required permanent pacemakers for appearance of serious conduction defects and recurrent syncope. Therefore, ventricular late potentials are a frequent finding in patients with myotonic dystrophy. In our series they were sensitive in predicting complex ventricular arrhythmias being present in 75 % of cases and correctly identifying the patients with ventricular tachycardia. However, specificity and positive predictive value were unacceptable due to the high false-positive rate. Also, the absence of cardiac catastrophic events during follow-up calls in question the prognostic value of ventricular late potentials in myotonic dystroph...|$|E
40|$|AC Analog {{voltmeters}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular electronic measuring instruments in use today. They are used to measure the RMS voltage of the many waveforms commonly found in electronics. This article will provide you with the basics of AC analog voltmeters. It will give you a better understanding of their operation, allowing you to select the right one for your particular measurement. The RMS or <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>voltage</b> is measured because this value gives us the most information about the waveform. The RMS voltage is equivalent to a DC voltage which produces the same heating effect as the AC signal being measured. For example, 1 volt of DC across a 1 ohm resistor will dissipate 1 watt. If we substitute any periodic waveform in place of the DC source and adjust its amplitude so that we again have 1 watt of power dissipated in the load, then our AC signal has an RMS or effective value of 1 volt. In addition to its RMS value, a waveform also has a peak and average voltage value. See Figure 1. ov This sine wave has an RMS value of 1 volt. Its peak value is 1. 4 times its RMS value, or 1. 4 volts. Its rectified average or DC value is. 636 times the peak or. 9 volts in the above example. AC voltmeters are designed to respond to one of these three values. This classifies the meters into true RMS responding, average responding and peak responding. The average and peak responding voltmeters are designed to measure only sine waves. Average Responding With an average responding voltmeter, a sine wave being measured is fed through a DC blocking capacitor, amplified or attenuated, rectified by the diode bridge and fed to the meter. The meter then responds to this rectified average or DC value. The average value of a sine wave is zero, so when we say average responding we mean the rectified average or DC component after rectification. This DC component deflects a d’Arsonval (moving coil) meter to indicate the RMS value of a sine wave...|$|E
