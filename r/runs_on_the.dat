5|$|The Queens Boulevard line {{is served}} by four {{overlapping}} routes. The E train serves the section between 50th Street and Briarwood, normally running express west of 71st Avenue. The F runs express from 36th Street to 71st Avenue and local east of 71st Avenue. The M and R serve local stops on the route west of 71st Avenue, with the M diverging from the line west of Fifth Avenue/53rd Street and the R splitting west of Queens Plaza. The E and F serve the line at all times, while the M <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line during weekdays only and the R <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line at all times except late nights. During late nights, the E makes local stops west of Briarwood to provide local service along the line. The routes experience frequent overcrowding during weekdays, and the Queens Boulevard line has among the highest rush-hour train frequencies in the system. A proposed upgrade to the line, to replace its signals with a communications-based train control system, would add capacity to the line.|$|E

50|$|Signals are {{normally}} placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of <b>the</b> line: <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left if <b>the</b> trains <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left. But in the Départements of Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin) and Moselle, trains normally <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right and so signals are placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right. This area {{was part of}} Germany from 1870 to 1918; trains <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right in Germany and the railways were built during that period. When the area became French again in 1918, the railway network was almost complete, and trains <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right. Reversing the direction would be too expensive, in particular for interlocking, so circulation and signals remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right.|$|R
