50|$|The Peugeot design {{works by}} varying the {{effective}} {{length of the}} con-rods connecting the piston to the crank. When the con-rod is shorter, the compression ratio is lower and vice versa. On the left hand-side of the diagram is the conventional piston of an internal combustion engine. On the right is an hydraulic cylinder with double-acting piston. This acts through a <b>rod-crank</b> <b>system</b> with a gear wheel, whose movement adjusts the effective con-rod length and thus the compression ratio in the left cylinder.|$|E
40|$|The UE {{investments}} for the renewable source development, {{in order to}} achieve the set goals (Kyoto protocol and “ 20 - 20 - 20 ” targets), push to investigate in new technologies and to develop the existing. In this context, the cogeneration (CHP) plays a fundamental role, and in particular, the micro-CHP has wide development margins. Among the different cogeneration process, the systems driven by a free-piston Stirling engine {{are one of the most}} significant challenges in the research area. In such systems, the thermal energy, coming from primary energy source (for example renewable energy), is converted into mechanical energy through a Stirling engine, and then a linear generator converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy, finally, the generator is connected to the electric grid or to the load by means of an electric converter. The use of the linear generator, instead of the traditional systems of linear to alternating motion conversion (<b>rod-crank</b> <b>system),</b> allows achieving several advantages, including: improving the system reliability, noise and cost reduction. Finally, this kind of system, if well-designed, allows improving the system efficiency. In this thesis a linear generator, directly coupled to a free-piston Stirling engine in a CHP system, was developed and analysed. It was found, after a first phase of the study and literature review, that the most convenient choice, from the technical and economic point of view, is a single-phase tubular permanent magnet linear generator. In particular, the magnets are made of plasto-neodymium, while, for the realization of the stator magnetic circuit, due to the geometrical complexity, soft magnetic composites (SMC) materials have been considered. In order to determine the generator performance, an analysis method based on FEAs was developed. This simplified method (HFEA) allows the study and the comparison of different magnetization patterns and current supply strategies. The proposed methodology exploits the representation of the magnetization spatial harmonics through an analytical processing that allows taking into account different magnetization profile of the permanent magnets. Thus, it was possible to reconstruct the most important quantities, such as the flux density and the flux linkage, superposing the effect of each harmonic obtained through the Fourier analysis. Furthermore, a procedure, able to reproduce the effects of magnetic saturation of the mover, generally not negligible in such kind of machines, was developed. For this purpose, an appropriate surface current distribution on the yoke of the mover was introduced, in order to reproduce the demagnetizing effect due to the saturation. By means of the air gap flux density, the force provided by linear generator was calculated, while, by means of the flux density sampled on suitable points on the stator and mover yokes, the iron losses were estimated and then the machine efficiency. By means of the flux linkage the emf provided by linear generator was determined. The results show a very good agreement with corresponding FEAs. The proposed analysis method allows carrying out a parametric analysis with a lower computational effort. Thanks to this feature, different magnetization patterns, supply strategies and SMC materials can be compared in order to optimize the machine design. A prototype based on the design guidelines was built; then, a procedure based on experimental measurement was developed to characterize the electromagnetic parameters. To determine the magnetization profile of the magnets, the flux density on the mover surface was carried out by means of a Gaussmeter. As regards the SMC materials that compose the stator core, a calculation method was developed from suitable experimental elaborations, in order to determine the most important magnetic properties, such as the BH curve and core loss coefficients. From experimental results, it can be noted that the actual characteristics are poorer than those provided by the manufactured datasheets, likely due to the manufacturing processes and spurious air gaps between the SMC modules. The update electromagnetic parameters are used to determine the actual performance of the machine, particularly to estimate the efficiency, the emf and the force. Finally, a simplified model of the cogeneration system was developed in order to predict the dynamic behaviour and particularly, the actual values of the speed, output power and efficiency. This model allows developing the control strategy of the linear generator acting on the electric converter...|$|E
