40|$|The {{bright red}} berries of this native Hawaiian species are most {{commonly}} harvested from wild plants for jam. However, the plant has {{potential as a}} potted ornamental. Propagation from seed and raising of seedlings to size were covered in detail. Work with a clonally propagated cultivar, 'Kilauea', was described. Powdery mildew and the Mexican leaf <b>roller</b> <b>caterpillar</b> were the major pests...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of 56 Eucalyptus species (119 provenances) at two exposed, seasonally dry, hill country {{sites in the}} Wairarapa district was assessed at age 5 years. There were significant differences among species in height and diameter growth, Eucalyptus tortoise beetle (Paropsis charybdis Stal) and leaf <b>roller</b> <b>caterpillar</b> (Strepsicrates macropetana Meyrick) damage, wind damage, stem straightness, crown width, crown density, and branch size. Eucalyptus cordat...|$|R
5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a host plant for the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens. Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton stainer bug, a pest of cotton crops, and the kurrajong leaf <b>roller</b> <b>caterpillar</b> that chews on the foliage and rolls individual leaves, within which it then pupates. Bottle tree scrub is a key habitat of the near threatened black-breasted buttonquail. Brachychiton rupestris can withstand bushfires and responds by flowering and putting forth new foliage afterwards.|$|R

It can solve the wheeled vehicle the question which in the soft wet slippery location work ability drops. Based on the loader the {{rubber conversion}} track wheel design analysis results, has carried on the overall concept design to the loader track wheel. This plan uses the middle brace structure, the design absorption of shock stretching device, has solved the problem which track wheel bearing power small, the vibration and the <b>caterpillar</b> <b>band</b> tighten. Through to the loader track wheel straight line travel, climbing power, obstacle negotiation ability, changes ability the simulation analysis, has carried on the confirmation to the design proposal. The simulation result indicated that the loader track wheel road surface compatible, the climbing and obstacle crossing ability are good, change nimbly...|$|R

This study investigated compaction meter value (CMV), {{also known as}} Caterpillar compaction value (CCV), and machine drive power (MDP) from <b>Caterpillar</b> <b>rollers,</b> and kB stiffness from an Ammann roller...|$|R

They broke up in December 2003, with Jeff and Kevin {{going on to}} join Haram as well as forming the bands Malady and Verse En Coma (the latter also {{featuring}} Ryan Parrish), and Brandon and Pat forming Ghastly City Sleep.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked about}} his {{influences}} {{at the time of}} writing As the Roots Undo, Drew Speziale referred to bands that were innovating punk and hardcore through incorporating a lot of melody, including their tour-mates Majority Rule, Pg. 99 and City of <b>Caterpillar</b> and <b>bands</b> who had [...] "really dark melodies going on underneath an overtly pretty brutal sound" [...] such as Orchid and His Hero Is Gone, besides less intense artists such as Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Modest Mouse and Built to Spill.|$|R
40|$|A field {{investigation}} on the seasonal incidence of frequently occurring leaf eating pests of mulberry {{was carried out}} for two annual cycles from Aurangabad district of Maharashtra state. The present survey was conducted during June 2009 to May 2011. The result shows that, different pests are damaging the Mulberry cop from the study area which causes heavy economical loss to sericulture farmers. The pests occurred were leaf <b>roller,</b> Bihar hairy <b>caterpillar,</b> cutworms, Red hairy caterpillar, Jassid / leaf hopper, Southern green stink bug / Pentatomid bug, Tree hoppers, Litchi bug, wasp moth and wingless grasshopper etc. In the present study classification, occurrence and type of damage and symptoms of the defoliator insect communities was also worked out in the mulberry field from various sites in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra state, India...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} {{comprised}} of experimental testing and statistical analyses {{was conducted to}} evaluate the Caterpillar machine drive power (MDP) and Geodynamik compaction meter value (CMV) compaction monitoring technologies applied to <b>Caterpillar</b> <b>rollers.</b> The study was comprised of three projects, all of which wee conducted at the Caterpillar Edwards Demonstration facility near Peoria, IL. The first project investigated the feasibility of using MDP applied to a Caterpillar self-propelled non-vibratory 825 G roller. A test strip was constructed, compacted using the prototype 825 G roller, and tested with in situ test devices. The second project also consisted of experimental testing on one-dimensional test strips. This project, however, used five cohesionless base materials, which were compacted using a CS- 533 E vibratory smooth drum roller with both MDP and CMV measurement capabilities. The independent roller measurements were compared and {{described in terms of}} soil engineering properties. The final project was conducted with only one cohesionless material. Four test strips (three uniform strips at different moisture contents and one with variable lift thickness) were constructed and tested to develop relationships between roller measurements and soil engineering properties. Using the material of the test strips, two-dimensional test areas with variable lift thickness and moisture content were then tested. Spatial analyses of the in situ measurements were performed to identify the spatial distribution of soil properties. The interpretation of the ground condition was then compared to machine output for evaluating the roller measurement systems and the proposed roller calibration procedure...|$|R
60|$|Now, I {{know that}} cantankerous person, the {{universal}} objector, has all along been bursting to interrupt me and declare {{that he himself}} frequently finds no end of caterpillars, and has not the slightest difficulty at all in distinguishing them {{with the naked eye}} from the leaves and plants among which they are lurking. But observe how promptly we crush and demolish this very inconvenient and disconcerting critic. The caterpillars he finds are almost all hairy ones, very conspicuous and easy to discover--'woolly bears,' and such like common and unclean creatures--and the reason they take no pains to conceal themselves from his unobservant eyes is simply this: nobody on earth wants to discover them. For either they are protectively encased in horrid hairs, which get down your throat and choke you and bother you (I speak as a bird, {{from the point of view}} of a confirmed caterpillar eater), or else they are bitter and nasty to the taste, like the larva of the spurge moth and the machaon butterfly. These are the ordinary brown and red and <b>banded</b> <b>caterpillars</b> that the critical objector finds in hundreds on his peregrinations about his own garden--commonplace things which the experienced naturalist has long since got utterly tired of. But has your rash objector ever lighted upon that rare larva which lives among the periwinkles, and exactly imitates a periwinkle petal? Has he ever discovered those deceptive creatures which pretend for all the world to be leaves of lady's-bedstraw, or dress themselves up as flowers of buttonweed? Has he ever hit upon those immoral caterpillars which wriggle through life upon the false pretence that they are only the shadows of projecting ribs on the under surface of a full-grown lime leaf? No, not he; he passes them all by without one single glance of recognition; and when the painstaking naturalist who has hunted them every one down with lens and butterfly net ventures tentatively to describe their personal appearance, he comes up smiling with his great russet woolly bear comfortably nestling upon a green cabbage leaf, and asks you in a voice of triumphant demonstration, where is the trace of concealment or disguise in that amiable but very inedible insect? Go to, Sir Critic, I will have none of you; I only use you for a metaphorical marionette to set up and knock down again, as Mr. Punch in the street show knocks down the policeman who comes to arrest him, and the grimy black personage of sulphurous antecedents who pops up with a fizz through the floor of his apartment.|$|R
