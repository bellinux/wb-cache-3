40|$|Changes {{of the pore}} {{structure}} of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibers</b> and the strength properties of papers produced by old corrugated container (OCC) <b>recycled</b> <b>fibers</b> were studied, after they were subjected to different stock preparation and papermaking processes. In this paper, the effects of beating, sizing, pressing, and drying on fiber properties were investigated, and the porous structure of fibers was analyzed by nitrogen adsorption technique. The results showed that beating, pressing, and other physical processes significantly influenced the fiber properties, whereas the effects of sizing were minor. Significant changes of water retention value (WRV), crystallinity index, and paper strength were observed after those processes. Further, an effort {{has been made to}} show relationships between {{pore structure}} and macroscopic properties (WRV, crystallinity index) of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to examine how swelling treatments affect the hydroxyl avail-ability and surface chemistry of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibers.</b> It also assessed the use of organic liquids in mitigating fiber hornification, the loss of hydrogen-bonding ability in <b>recycled</b> <b>fibers.</b> Hardwood bleached ha f t pulp <b>fibers</b> were <b>recycled,</b> swollen, and subsequently analyzed for water retention value (WRV), dy-namic contact angle, and hydroxyl number. Results show that the relative swelling powers of the liquids were: 12 % NaOH> formamide> dimethyl sulfoxide = 2 % NaOH = ethylene glycol. These liquids resulted in WRVs that were 23 - 72 % higher than the control, i. e. the water-swollen <b>recycled</b> <b>fibers</b> (WRV 1. lo). Swelling increased the hydroxyl number of the fibers except for those treated with 12 % NaOH. Fibers that were swollen to a greater extent had a higher total surface-free energy and a lower water contact angle. By swelling the fibers in organic liquids, polar surface-free energy increased with an increase in hydroxyl numbers. Such a relationship was obscured for the alkaline treatments, which presumably altered the chemical composition of the fibers. These findings promote understand-ing for a more effective formulation of treatment methods for <b>recycled</b> <b>fibers.</b> An immediate impli-cation from this study is the strong fiber swelling power of formamide whose concentration and cost efficiency should be optimized in future studies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of <b>recycled</b> {{polyester}} <b>fiber,</b> produced from polyethylene (PET) bottles, in combination with nano-SiO 2 as a new stabilizer to improve the mechanical properties of soils. We intend to study {{the effect of}} adding nano-SiO 2 and <b>recycled</b> polyester <b>fiber</b> on soil engineering properties, especially the shear strength and unconfined compressive strength (UCS), using clayey soil with low liquid limit. Three different combinations of fiber-soil ratios ranging between 0. 1 % and 0. 5 % as well as three different combinations of nano-soil ratios ranging between 0. 5 % and 1 % are used. The shear strength and UCS of treated specimens are obtained from direct shear test and unconfined compression test, respectively. Results of this study show that the addition of <b>recycled</b> polyester <b>fiber</b> and nano-SiO 2 increases the strength of soil specimens. Both the shear strength and UCS are improved by increasing the contents of <b>recycled</b> polyester <b>fiber</b> and nano-SiO 2 in the soil mixture. The increase in the nano-SiO 2 content leads to a reduction in failure strain, but the increase in the content of <b>recycled</b> polyester <b>fiber</b> leads to an increase in failure strain. The increase in the contents of <b>recycled</b> polyester <b>fiber</b> and nano-SiO 2 leads to an increase in elastic modulus of soils. Based on the test results, the addition of <b>recycled</b> polyester <b>fiber</b> improves the mechanical properties of soils stabilized with nano-SiO 2 as well as the <b>recycled</b> polyester <b>fiber</b> has a positive effect on soil behaviors...|$|R

50|$|There are upper {{limits on}} the {{percentage}} of the world's newsprint that can be manufactured from <b>recycled</b> <b>fiber.</b> For instance, some of the fiber that enters a recycled pulp mill is lost in pulping, due to inefficiencies inherent in the process. According to the web site of the U.K. chapter of Friends of the Earth, wood fiber can normally only be recycled up to five times due to damage to the fiber. Thus, unless the quantity of newsprint used each year worldwide declines in line with the lost fiber, a certain amount of new (virgin) fiber is required each year globally, even though individual newsprint mills may use 100% <b>recycled</b> <b>fiber.</b>|$|E
