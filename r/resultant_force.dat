5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the contact patch. The <b>resultant</b> <b>force</b> of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the side-slip, away from the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E

The work-energy {{principle}} states that an increase in the kinetic energy of a rigid body is caused by an equal amount of positive work done on the body by the <b>resultant</b> <b>force</b> acting on that body.

However, Newton's laws are not more fundamental than momentum conservation, because Newton's laws are merely consistent with the fact that zero <b>resultant</b> <b>force</b> acting on an object implies constant momentum, while a <b>resultant</b> <b>force</b> implies the momentum is not constant. Momentum conservation is always true for an isolated system not subject to resultant forces.|$|E

Although the magnitudes of values for forces varied considerably between specimens for a given test condi-tion, the patterns of loading with respect to direction of loading and the angle of flexion of the knee were re-markably consistent.

40|$|China is {{currently}} building {{the largest single}} dish radio telescope in the world, which is called the Five-hundred meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The feed support system in the FAST is composed of a cable-driven parallel manipulator, an A-B rotator, and a Stewart platform. Since the stiffness of the cable-driven parallel manipulator is low, the feed support system is prone to vibrate under {{the action of the}} Stewart platform. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to study the self-excited vibration of the feed support system. Self-excited vibration involves the natural frequencies of the system and the <b>resultant</b> <b>forces</b> produced by the motion of the Stewart platform. This paper linearizes the dynamic equations of the system at an operating point and determines the configuration-dependent natural frequencies in the given workspace. This paper obtains the <b>resultant</b> <b>forces</b> from the legs due to the motion of the Stewart platform by using the numerical method. According to the natural frequencies and the <b>resultant</b> <b>forces,</b> the condition of self-excited vibration is given and verified by simulations. In order to verify the linearization method, an experimental platform of a cable-driven parallel manipulator is set up. The experimental results match well with the theoretical arithmetic.

25|$|A kite is a {{tethered}} {{air foil}} that creates both lift and drag, {{in this case}} anchored to a vehicle with a tether, which guides {{the face of the}} kite to achieve the best angle of attack. The lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air flows around the kite's surface, producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings. The interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind. The <b>resultant</b> <b>force</b> vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of {{one or more of the}} lines or tethers to which the kite is attached, thereby powering the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The main {{mechanism}} for sorting is {{the arrangement of}} the optical lattice points. As the cell flow through the optical lattice, there are forces due to the particles drag force that is competing directly with the optical gradient force (See Physics of optical tweezers) from the optical lattice point. By shifting {{the arrangement of the}} optical lattice point, there is a preferred optical path where the optical forces are dominant and biased. With the aid of the flow of the cells, there is a <b>resultant</b> <b>force</b> that is directed along that preferred optical path. Hence, there is a relationship of the flow rate with the optical gradient force. By adjusting the two forces, one will be able to obtain a good optical sorting efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of cutting conditions on temperature of CBN cutting tool edge during dry hard machining of hardened AISI D 2 tool steel (62 ± 1 HRC) is investigated in this paper. Measuring cutting tool edge temperature with experimental methods is time-consuming and diseconomy in dry hard machining.

25|$|In {{the case}} of distant objects and a {{rotating}} reference frame, what {{must be taken into}} account is the <b>resultant</b> <b>force</b> of centrifugal and Coriolis force. Consider a distant star observed from a rotating spacecraft. In the reference frame co-rotating with the spacecraft, the distant star appears to move along a circular trajectory around the spacecraft. The apparent motion of the star is an apparent centripetal acceleration. Just like in the example above of the car in circular motion, the centrifugal force has the same magnitude as the fictitious centripetal force, but is directed in the opposite, centrifugal direction. In this case the Coriolis force is twice the magnitude of the centrifugal force, and it points in centripetal direction. The vector sum of the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force is the total fictitious force, which in this case points in centripetal direction.|$|E
500|$|Newton's First Law of Motion {{states that}} objects {{continue}} to move {{in a state of}} constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force (<b>resultant</b> <b>force).</b> This law is an extension of Galileo's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force (see a more detailed description of this below). Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium [...] "natural state" [...] in place of the Aristotelian idea of the [...] "natural state of rest". That is, Newton's empirical First Law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity. By making rest physically indistinguishable from non-zero constant velocity, Newton's First Law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities. Specifically, in systems where objects are moving with different velocities, it is impossible to determine which object is [...] "in motion" [...] and which object is [...] "at rest". The laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference, that is, in all frames related by a Galilean transformation.|$|E

3000|$|Unlike the {{electric}} field and shear strain shown in Figs.  3 and 4, the shear stress exhibits a somewhat complicated distribution, {{as shown in}} Fig.  5. Due to the antisymmetry of the surface electric potential described by Eq. (27), the shear stresses in the [...] y [...] and θ directions {{cancel each other out}} around [...] y = 0 therefore, the <b>resultant</b> shear <b>force</b> in [...] y [...] direction, [...] N_y, and the resultant twisting moment around [...] z -axis, [...] M_z, are absent, as predicted by Eq. (42).

40|$|ABSTRACT. The article {{discusses}} a contour element method {{applied to}} numerical simulations of crack propagation trajectories in elastic structures. Because the boundary integral equation degenerates for a body with two crack-surfaces occupying {{the same location}} one of the forms of the displacement discontinuity method is implemented. According to the implemented method, <b>resultant</b> <b>forces</b> and dislocation densities, which are placed at mid-nodes of contour segments {{on one of the}} crack surfaces, are characterized by the indirect boundary integral equation. Contrarily to internal crack problems, for edge crack problems an edge-discontinuous element is used at the intersection between a crack and an edge to avoid a common node at the intersection. New numerical formulations that are built up on analytical integration are implemented. Therefore, all regular and singular integrals are evaluated only analytically. Tractions and <b>resultant</b> <b>forces</b> at a mid-node of any contour segment are regularized by a nonlocal characterization function. Hence, values of their components are obtained from the modified form of Somigliana’s identity that embraces nonlocal elements and standard elements of kernel matrices used in the boundary element analysis...|$|R
40|$|Discontinuities {{in a rock}} mass can {{intersect}} an excavation {{surface to}} form discrete blocks (keyblocks) which can be unstable. Once a potentially unstable block is identified, the forces affecting it can be calculated to assess its stability. The normal and shear stresses on each block face before displacement are calculated using elastic theory and are modified in a nonlinear way by discontinuity deformations as the keyblock displaces. The stresses are summed into <b>resultant</b> <b>forces</b> to evaluate block stability. Since the <b>resultant</b> <b>forces</b> change with displacement, successive increments of block movement are examined {{to see whether the}} block ultimately becomes stable or fails. Two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) analytic models for the stability of simple pyramidal keyblocks were evaluated. Calculated stability is greater for 3 D analyses than for 2 D analyses. Calculated keyblock stability increases with larger in situ stress magnitudes, larger lateral stress ratios, and larger shear strengths. Discontinuity stiffness controls blocks displacement more strongly than it does stability itself. Large keyblocks are less stable than small ones, and stability increases as blocks become more slender...|$|R
