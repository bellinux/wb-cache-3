40|$|Abstract. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) {{process can}} be used to produce the rapid tooling {{directly}} or indirectly. However, rapid tooling application demands good surface finish since the poor surface finish of FDM parts has become a limitation for its tool application. So there is need to improve the surface finish of FDM made tools. In this study, surface roughness of FDM tools are drastically reduced by a post processing technique called chemical treatment process. Surface finish was improved by filling the gap between layers by diffusion of parent material. Thus FDM made tools can be used as direct as well as indirect tools after the chemical treatment. Comparative study was made between Silicon <b>Rubber</b> <b>Moulding</b> and FDM Tooling towards the cost, time, life of mould, quality and feasibility aspects. It was found that FDM tooling is more economical, easy to use, reduced cycle time, improved quality, long life of mould and more feasibility towards complex parts etc...|$|E

By using a method of centrifugal casting large-volume components can be fabricated to near net shape dimensions without limiting the outer contour's complexity.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work is to offer a unique procedure of integrated Reverse Engineering (RE) and Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies through implementation of a comprehensive experimental study to present an extensive comparison between applicable rapid technologies for blade rapid investment casting. Different direct and indirect AM techniques were used to produce sacrificial investment casting patterns. In addition, an aluminium mould of a blade for wax injection was fabricated using Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining to compare conventional investment casting with the proposed rapid investment casting process. Dimensional inspection of cast blades showed that the MultiJet Modelling (MJM) method has the most economic justification and compatibility with blade rapid investment casting {{and it can be}} considered as an alternative to conventional wax precision CNC machining. On the other hand, sacrificial patterns produced by the Perfactory system showed lower applicability for investment casting due to pattern flexibility and difficulties in burn-out step.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is to present a part complexity, based on basic {{information}} of the STL data. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a few methods of evaluating the complexity of the shape, based on the parts STL data. Methods vary from very simple based on the number of triangles in STL file and the parts volume, to the more complex mathematical determination based on the relations of the basic STL data. Findings: We discovered that evaluation of shape complexity based only on basic data of STL data gives us some basic view on part complexity. Research limitations/implications: For parts with large block volume/part volume ratio and thinner parts with free form surfaces only the first method is suitable and gives suitable results. Practical implications: The complexity of the shape of a part is an important factor for all manufacturing procedures. When using conventional machining, the parts complexity presents a key factor in determining the optimal way of manufacturing. Also, when using rapid tooling (for example silicon <b>rubber</b> <b>moulding)</b> the complexity of the part determines the parting plane layout and eventual tool construction (inserts, cores, etc.). Even when using certain rapid prototyping procedures, the support material consumption depends highly on the complexity of the part and together with the problem of optimal orientation and position of the part, significantly influences the manufacturing costs. At the end of the article a few test method are presented that try to determine the complexity regarding to the procedure by which the part will be manufactured. Originality/value: Choosing maximum efficient manufacturing processes on base of part complexity is a new perspective in manufacturing, which, properly evolved and complied can cause revolution in manufacturing optimization, especially in hybrid manufacturing processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} scale on shear {{strength}} is studied by performing direct shear tests on different sized samples of large joints. A <b>rubber</b> <b>moulding</b> system {{is used to}} obtain impressions of the roughness {{from a variety of}} natural joint surfaces. A brittle model material is developed and used to cast several sets of identical interlocking specimens, which are in turn subdivided into sets of equidimensional joint block samples, each of the sets representing a different average block size or joint length. All sample sizes are tested in the same relative direction of shearing and under precisely the same level of normal stress. A total of eleven joints displaying a large variety of surface roughness is included in the experimental programme. The results from those tests show that peak shear strength is a strongly scale-dependent variable. Scale effects are most pronounced in cases of rough undulating joints, whereas they are virtually absent for relatively planar joints. The key factor behind the changing behaviour and strength with increasing scale is the involvement of different sizes of asperities in controlling the peak behaviour of different lengths of joints. An important consequence is a decrease in the value of roughness coefficient (JRC) and wall strength (JCS) operating at larger scale. Use of those indices may enable realistic allowance to be made. for the scale effect in peak shear strength. The normal deformability of rock joints is investigated by conducting loading/unloading and repeated load cycling tests on a wide ranging variety of fresh and weathered joints in five different rocks. The shear deformability is studied by performing direct shear tests at different levels of normal stress in a portable shear box. Several mismatched joints are also tested under compression. In the present work the analytical representation of the stress deformation curves is considered in detail. Quantitative relationships between maximum closure, aperture, wall strength and roughness are defined...|$|E
40|$|Compression {{moulding}} is {{the ideal}} candidate for large series production of thermoplastic composite parts. Improvements in this production technique will make it more appealing for those markets that are reluctant to use composites because of their development costs. Unlike other composites processing systems, the compression moulding press is capable of producing fibre-reinforced plastic parts in significant volumes, with the accuracy, repeatability and speed to which, for example, the automotive industry has been accustomed in the stamping of metal parts. This thesis aims at {{a better understanding of}} the behaviour of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mould</b> during compression moulding of thermoplastics and consequently at the reduction of the development costs and improving the design of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mould.</b> The classical problems that need to be addressed when designing a <b>rubber</b> <b>mould</b> are the correct dimensions to accommodate the laminate and the positions of the details. The standard process, though, does not take into account the temperature changes in the mould during production and in particular the effect of the coefficient of thermal expansion of the rubber. In this thesis, an envisioned method to reduce this problem is to add a certain amount of aramide in the <b>rubber</b> <b>mould,</b> in order to restrict the expansion due to increased temperature. The second issue that has to be considered is the friction between the melted thermoplastic and the <b>rubber</b> <b>mould.</b> The use of lubricant is extremely effective, but can be used only in a prototyping phase, as the lubricant affects the mechanical properties of the thermoplastic composite. Proper modelling of the rubber forming process, considering the correct rubber parameters, allows identification of the problems that might occur during manufacturing. The way to eliminate those problems numerically, though, is computationally challenging as well as uncertain and time consuming. With those results in mind, an improved method was developed which substitutes the flexible <b>rubber</b> <b>mould</b> with a collection of rubber particles. The collection of rubber particles acts in a way similar to that of a fluid and has the advantage of filling the mould completely so that there is always contact between the rigid and the flexible mould. The new method allows the manufacturing of a wider range of products and allows the reduction of development costs related to the definition of the proper <b>rubber</b> <b>mould</b> shape. To be able to describe the collection of rubber particles as a homogeneus material, a series of tests has been designed for the determination of some of their physical parameters. The obtained material has a very variable stiffness, from a very low modulus when the particles are not compressed, to two orders of magnitude higher values when compaction is almost complete. Bulk and shear modulus are related to the Poisson’s ratio that does not vary much during the entire process, having a value always slightly below 0. 5. This value is consistent with the fluid-like behavior in the beginning of the process and with the, almost incompressible, solid rubber block at the end of the process. Finally, the parameters found have been used to model the compression moulding process with a collection of rubber particles. Modeling is not strictly necessary because most of the existing problems in the conventional production method have been eliminated. However it might become useful when the limitations of the new production technique will be explored and in particular for those geometries that are not possible with the conventional method.

Aims: This study conducted to determine the effect of different curing temperatures on the accuracy of fit of a complete maxillary denture and to compare with that of fiber-reinforced acrylic resins. Materials and Methods : An ideal maxillary <b>rubber</b> <b>mould</b> used to make an edentulous cast. Forty-eight stone casts made from the ideal <b>rubber</b> <b>mould.</b> Out of 48 identical stone casts, 44 stone casts with wax adapted processed using simple acrylic resin. The remaining four stone casts were processed using fiber-reinforced acrylic resin. However, processing time for 12 hrs was maintained constant for all the samples.
