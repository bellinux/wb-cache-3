The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the current LKMR density on lands managed by the United States Navy, Naval Air Station Key West and evaluate how vegetation structure and patch elevation effect LKMR population density. I conducted fecal pellet counts to determine LKMR density, collected vegetation data using percent composition of ground cover, Robel <b>range</b> <b>pole,</b> and point-centered quarter methods, and obtained data on patch area and elevation. I used simple linear regression to assess the relationship between LKMR density and 9 measured vegetation characteristics, patch area, and patch elevation to determine which variables have an influence on LKMR density and the relationship between them. In my examination of the simple regression models, 6 out of the 11 variables appeared to influence LKMR population density. The average per patch percent composition of nonliving material and grasses, maximum height of vegetation at the <b>range</b> <b>pole,</b> distance to nearest woody vegetation, patch elevation, and visual obstruction readings (VOR) individually accounted for 26. 4 %, 30. 4 %, 18. 1 %, 8. 5 %, 6. 8 %, and 1. 4 % of the variability in LKMR density, respectively. According to the regression models, LKMR density increased in patches with greater amounts of grasses and with greater distance to woody vegetation.

Initially these were made of light, thin and straight bamboo or of well seasoned wood such as teak, pine or deodar.

The rods are usually 3 cm in diameter and 2 m or 3 m long, painted alternatively either red and white or black and white in lengths of 20 cm (i.e. one link length of metric chain). These colours are used so that the rod can be properly sited in case of long distance or bad weather. Ranging rods of greater length, i.e., 4 m to 6 m, are called <b>ranging</b> <b>poles</b> and are used in case of very long survey lines.

40|$|A mobile mapping system (MMS) is {{a mobile}} {{multi-sensor}} platform {{developed by the}} geoinformation community to support the acquisition of huge amounts of geodata {{in the form of}} georeferenced high resolution images and dense laser clouds. Since data fusion and data integration techniques are increasingly able to combine the complementary strengths of different sensor types, the external calibration of a camera to a laser scanner is a common pre-requisite on today's mobile platforms. The methods of calibration, nevertheless, are often relatively poorly documented, are almost always time-consuming, demand expert knowledge and often require a carefully constructed calibration environment. A new methodology is studied and explored to provide a high quality external calibration for a pinhole camera to a laser scanner which is automatic, easy to perform, robust and foolproof. The method presented here, uses a portable, standard <b>ranging</b> <b>pole</b> which needs to be positioned on a known ground control point. For calibration, a well studied absolute orientation problem needs to be solved. In many cases, the camera and laser sensor are calibrated in relation to the INS system. Therefore, the transformation from camera to laser contains the cumulated error of each sensor in relation to the INS. Here, the calibration of the camera is performed in relation to the laser frame using the time synchronization between the sensors for data association. In this study, the use of the inertial relative movement will be explored to collect more useful calibration data. This results in a better intersensor calibration allowing better coloring of the clouds and a more accurate depth mask for images, especially on the edges of objects in the scene...|$|R

Six spatial dimensions expected to have three different perceptual structures in terms of the point and range nature of O 1, INT and O 2 were analysed. Presented with images, the participants were instructed to identify each region (O 1, INT, O 2), first by looking at the region, and then circumscribing it using the computer mouse. We measured the eye movements, identification times and various characteristics of the drawings such as the relative size of the three regions, overlaps and gaps. Three main results emerged. Firstly, generally speaking, intermediate regions were not different from the poles on any of the indicators: overall identification times, number of fixations, and locations. Some differences emerged with regard to the duration of fixations for point INTs and the number of fixations for range INTs between two <b>range</b> <b>poles</b> (O 1, O 2). Secondly, the analyses of the fixation locations showed that the poles support the identification of the intermediate region as much as the intermediate region supports the identification of the poles. Finally, the relative size of the three areas selected in the drawing task were consistent with the classification of the regions as points or ranges. The analyses of the gaps and the overlaps between the three areas showed that the intermediate is neither O 1 nor O 2, but an entity in its own right...|$|R

Machine Guidance technology {{has the ability}} to tell the grader operator what height he is cutting to compared to the road design and even control the height of the Graders Blade if required. This research project analyses the accuracy of a Machine Guided Grader that is used in the formation of roads we use every day. The author demonstrates the accuracy by comparing heights recorded from the grader to heights surveyed in the field. For ease of use and convenience a Trimble Guided Grader is studied with the most up to date grader control system. The Trimble Guided Grader is supported by a Trimble SPS 930 total station achieving 1 ” of error in the Vertical and Horizontal circles. Teaming up of both these systems gives the best opportunity for accurate results whilst eliminating the likelihood of bias creeping in. Modern Trimble Guided Grader technology {{has the ability to}} record the finished surface constructed through a simple push of a button. This surface can then be used in quality and production reports replacing the need for a surveyor to manually survey the area every time. Field Tests were carried out using this surface to compare against what is surveyed off the <b>range</b> <b>pole</b> producing a set of differences between the two approaches. Two field tests were carried out with results showing an average difference of 0. 3 mm in one test and 3. 9 mm in the second giving the author confidence to conclude that the accuracy generated from a machine guided grader blade was demonstrated to within 4 mm of the actual surveyed surface. The 4 mm accuracy demonstrated that opportunities do exist in using the recorded surface as a formal document at times replacing the conformance report that is used for quality assurance purposes. The vision of this occurring would only be achieved through education and research that demonstrated the accuracy to clients like the Department of Transport and Main Roads. ...|$|R

I evaluated changes in species abundance and community parameters in relation to distance to the interface, {{as well as the}} relationship between small mammal communities and environmental variables. I used pitfall arrays and Sherman live traps to sample small mammals along 9 traplines at the land-use interface and on a gradient extending 375 m into each land-use. I used point-centered-quarter, <b>range</b> <b>pole,</b> and line-transect sampling to characterize plant community structure. Two generalist small mammal species had increased abundance as distance into the sugarcane increased. Two species with wide geographic ranges appeared to select areas within 75 m of the interface. Four species with restricted habitat tolerances or diets were negatively affected by sugarcane, as was 1 species that selects for low ground cover. Two species may have avoided the interface. For the majority of species in the Lowveld, sugarcane does not provide habitat. Sugarcane monocultures > 375 m in width may form a barrier to movement of small mammal species. Species richness and diversity significantly decreased at the interface of 2 sites, however, 1 site had increased diversity associated with the interface. My analysis indicated a difference in community composition between the 2 land-uses and differences between the farthest interior conservation area (375 m) -interface (0 m) and the farthest interior sugarcane (375 m). There was no difference in community composition between seasons or distances within the conservation area. The farthest interior sugarcane trapline had distinctness from other traplines within the sugarcane, and may be of importance for minimizing the effects of habitat fragmentation in lowveld savanna. The effects of sugarcane did not extend into adjoining natural vegetation. My results indicated grass biomass, litter depth and shrub density played important roles in structuring the communities.
