50|$|Molar mass {{determination}} of copolymers {{is a much}} more complicated procedure. The complications arise from the effect of solvent on the homopolymers and how this can affect the copolymer morphology. Analysis of copolymers typically requires multiple characterization methods. For instance, copolymers with short chain branching such as linear low-density polyethylene (a copolymer of ethylene and a higher alkene such as hexene or octene) require the use of Analytical Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation (ATREF) techniques. These techniques can reveal how the short chain branches are distributed over the various molecular weights. A more efficient analysis of copolymer molecular mass and composition is possible using GPC combined with a triple-detection system comprising multi-angle light scattering, UV absorption and differential <b>refractometry,</b> if the copolymer is composed of two base polymers that provide different responses to UV and/or refractive index.|$|E
5000|$|When a sugar {{solution}} {{is measured by}} refractometer or density meter, the °Bx or °P value obtained by entry into the appropriate table only represents the amount of dry solids dissolved in the sample if the dry solids are exclusively sucrose. This is seldom the case. Grape juice (must), for example, contains little sucrose but does contain glucose, fructose, acids and other substances. In such cases, the °Bx value clearly cannot be equated with the sucrose content, but it may represent a good approximation to the total sugar content. For example, an 11.0% by mass D-Glucose ("grape sugar") solution measured 10.9 °Bx using a hand held instrument. For these reasons, the sugar content of a solution obtained by use of <b>refractometry</b> with the ICUMSA table is often reported as [...] "Refractometric Dry Substance" [...] (RDS) which could {{be thought of as}} an equivalent sucrose content. Where it is desirable to know the actual dry solids content, empirical correction formulas can be developed based on calibrations with solutions similar to those being tested. For example, in sugar refining, dissolved solids can be accurately estimated from refractive index measurement corrected by an optical rotation (polarization) measurement.|$|E
50|$|The ICUMSA Methods Book {{contains}} detailed {{instructions for}} analyzing raw, cane, white, beet, molasses, plantation white and specialty sugars. Among these are methods for determination of dry solids content by polarimetry, densimetry and <b>refractometry,</b> color (extinction coefficient at 420 nm), reducing sugars, {{and the presence}} of metals such as arsenic and copper. The Methods Book also contains polynomials and tables (derived from the polynomials) which relate the refractive index of solutions of pure sucrose, glucose, fructose and invert sugar to the strength of those solutions. These are to be used with the analysis methods that characterize sugars by refractometric means but find wide application outside the sugar industry as the sucrose polynomial is built into the firmware of modern refractometers and is the basis for calibration of purely optical refractometers which read in Brix. Temperature correction factors, also derived from the polynomials, are the basis for the Automatic Temperature Compensation features found in those instruments. Thus, a vintner measuring the Brix of juice from his grapes by means of a refractometer accepts a sugar content reading based on the refractive properties of sucrose {{despite the fact that the}} primary sugar in grape juice is fructose, not sucrose. This usually does not result in significant error.|$|E

Samples of MC (n = 827) were collected from 67 farms in 12 states. Colostrum was analyzed for IgG by radial immunodiffusion (RID) and refractive index (nD) by a digital refractometer.

40|$|Quality {{control of}} {{hospital}} pharmacy formulations {{is of the}} utmost importance to ensure constant quality and to avoid potential mistakes during formulation. In this study we investigated the applicability of <b>refractometry</b> as a fast, inexpensive and easy-to-use quality control measurement. Refractive indices (RI) of a multitude of different hospital formulations with varying concentrations of active compound were measured. The samples consisted of a number of binary aqueous solutions (one compound in water), complex aqueous solutions (multiple compounds in water or in a constant matrix), two suspensions and one emulsion. For all these formulations, linear regression analysis was performed, quality control limits determined and accuracy and repeatability were checked. Subsequently, actual hospital pharmacy samples were analyzed to check whether they were within the specified limits. For both binary and complex aqueous formulations, repeatability was good and a linear correlation for all samples could be observed on condition that the concentration of the active compound was sufficiently high. The refractometer was not sensitive enough for solutions of folic acid and levothyroxine, which had too low a concentration of active compound. Due to lack of homogeneity and light scattering, emulsions and suspensions do not seem suitable for quality control by <b>refractometry.</b> A mathematical equation was generated to predict the refractive index of an aqueous solution containing clonidine HCl as active compound. Values calculated from the equation were compared with measured values and deviations of all samples were found to be lower than 1. 3 %. In order to use <b>refractometry</b> in a hospital pharmacy for quality control of multicomponent samples, additional intermediate measurements would be required, to overcome the fact that <b>refractometry</b> is not compound specific.

40|$|Objective-To compare 4 assay {{procedures}} for prediction of passive transfer status in lambs. Animals-Thirty-one 1 -day-old Sardinian lambs. Procedure-Serum IgG concentration {{was determined by}} use of single radial immunodiffusion, The following were determined: serum total protein concentration as measured by <b>refractometry</b> (ie, <b>refractometry</b> serum total protein concentration), serum total protein concentration {{as determined by the}} biuret method (ie, biuret method serum total protein concentration), serum gamma-globulin concentration as determined by serum protein electrophoresis, and serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity as measured by spectrophotometry. Accuracy of these assays for estimation of serum IgG concentration in 1 -day-old lambs was established by use of linear regression analysis. Results-Refractometry serum total protein concentration, biuret method serum total protein concentration, and serum gamma-globulin concentration were closely and linearly correlated with serum IgG concentration. The natural logarithm (In) of serum GGT activity was closely and linearly correlated with serum IgG concentration (In) <b>Refractometry</b> serum total protein concentration, biuret method serum total protein concentration, and gamma-globulin concentration accounted for approximately 85 %, 91 %, and 95 % of the variation in serum IgG concentration, respectively.

MethodsA total of 450 eyes of 305 subjects in the age range of 23 – 34 years were recruited for the study. A distribution of refractions was examined using a traditional method of the subjective <b>refractometry</b> on the basis of point-like posterior focus notion. Correction of the results was made {{on the assumption that the}} emmetropic eye retains high visual acuity when applying convex lenses with values which are fewer or equal to the depth of focus values. The following values of the depth of focus were used: ± 0. 55 D, ± 0. 35 D and ± 0. 2 D for visual acuity 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0, respectively. ResultsApplication of the traditional method of <b>refractometry</b> produced the following occurrence of refractions: hypermetropia 59. 3 %, myopia 22 % and emmetropia 18. 7 %.

40|$|Objectives: Refractometric {{methods to}} measure total protein (TP) in serum and plasma {{specimens}} {{have been replaced}} by automated biuret methods in virtually all routine clinical testing. A subset of laboratories, however, still report using <b>refractometry</b> to measure TP in conjunction with serum protein electrophoresis. The objective of this study was therefore to conduct a modern performance evaluation of a digital refractometer for TP measurement. Design and methods: Performance evaluation of a MISCO Palm Abbeâ¢ digital refractometer was conducted through device familiarization, carryover, precision, accuracy, linearity, analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity, and reference interval verification. Comparison assays included a manual refractometer and an automated biuret assay. Results: Carryover risk was eliminated using a demineralized distilled water (ddH 2 O) wash step. Precision studies demonstrated overall imprecision of 2. 2 % CV (low TP pool) and 0. 5 % CV (high TP pool). Accuracy studies demonstrated correlation to both manual <b>refractometry</b> and the biuret method. An overall positive bias (+ 5. 0 %) was observed versus the biuret method. On average, outlier specimens had an increased triglyceride concentration. Linearity was verified using mixed dilutions of: a) low and high concentration patient pools, or b) albumin-spiked ddH 2 O and high concentration patient pool. Decreased recovery was observed using ddH 2 O dilutions at low TP concentrations. Significant interference was detected at high concentrations of glucose (> 267 Â mg/dL) and triglycerides (> 580 Â mg/dL). Current laboratory reference intervals for TP were verified. Conclusions: Performance characteristics of this digital refractometer were validated in a clinical laboratory setting.

METHODS: Fresh urine specimens were tested for urine pH and osmolality (U-pH, U-Osm) by a pH meter and an osmometer, and for U-SG by three different methods (<b>refractometry,</b> automatic readout of a dipstick (Clinitek- 50), and (visual) change of colour of the dipstick). RESULTS: The correlations between the visual U-SG dipstick measurements and U-SG determined by a refractometer and the comparison of Clinitek((R)) - 50 dipstick U-SG measurements with U-Osm were less than optimal, showing very wide scatter of values. Only the U-SG refractometer values and U-Osm had a good linear correlation.

40|$|Purpose : To {{determine}} whether the refractive index (RI) of a soft contact lens can be evaluated using <b>refractometry</b> while the lens remains on the eye and to compare this with more traditional ex vivo RI measurements. Methods : A slitlamp apparatus was modified to incorporate a customized Atago hand refractometer. With a double-masked study design, nine adapted symptomatic soft contact lens wearers wore a contact lens in each eye (lotrafilcon B and etafilcon A) in a randomized order. In vivo RI was determined from the relative Brix scale measurements immediately after lens insertion and after 1 and 10 hr of lens wear. Ex vivo <b>refractometry</b> was performed after 10 hr of lens wear for comparison. Means ± standard errors of the means are reported. Results : In vivo RI values at baseline were 1. 422 ± 0. 0004 (lotrafilcon B) and 1. 405 ± 0. 0021 (etafilcon A); after 1 hr of lens wear, values were 1. 423 ± 0. 0006 and 1. 408 ± 0. 0007, respectively; and after 10 hr of lens wear, values were 1. 424 ± 0. 0004 and 1. 411 ± 0. 0010, respectively. Ex vivo RI values {{at the end of}} the 10 hr wearing period were 1. 424 ± 0. 0003 (lotrafilcon B) and 1. 412 ± 0. 0017 (etafilcon A).
