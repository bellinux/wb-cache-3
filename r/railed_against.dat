5|$|Du Bois was bitterly {{disappointed}} {{that many of}} his colleaguesparticularly the NAACPdid not support him during his 1951 PIC trial, whereas working class whites and blacks supported him enthusiastically. After the trial, Du Bois lived in Manhattan, writing and speaking, and continuing to associate primarily with leftist acquaintances. His primary concern was world peace, and he <b>railed</b> <b>against</b> military actions, such as the Korean War, which he viewed as efforts by imperialist whites to maintain colored people in a submissive state.|$|E
5|$|Gingrich {{and others}} in the House, {{including}} the newly minted Gang of Seven, <b>railed</b> <b>against</b> what they saw as ethical lapses during the nearly 40 years of Democratic control for almost 40 years. The House banking scandal and Congressional Post Office scandal were emblems of the exposed corruption. Gingrich himself was among members of the House who had written NSF checks on the House bank. He had overdrafts on twenty-two checks, including a $9,463 check to the Internal Revenue Service in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Khanh {{returned}} to the palace and reported {{the result of his}} conversation to the Ngos. He recommended that Diệm resign due {{to the demands of the}} rebel forces and protestors outside the palace. Madame Nhu <b>railed</b> <b>against</b> Diệm agreeing to a power-sharing arrangement, asserting that it was the destiny of Diệm and his family to save the country. Madame Nhu's aggressive stance and persistent calls for Khanh to attack, prompted the general to threaten to leave. This forced Diệm to silence his sister-in-law, and Khanh remained with the president.|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{advocated}} {{more natural}} and less formal-looking plantings of hardy perennials, shrubs, and climbers, and reacted against the High Victorian patterned gardening, which used tropical materials grown in greenhouses. He <b>railed</b> <b>against</b> standard roses, statuary, sham Italian gardens, and other artifices common in gardening at the time. Modern gardening practices first introduced by Robinson include: using alpine plants in rock gardens; dense plantings of perennials and groundcovers that expose no bare soil; use of hardy perennials and native plants; and large plantings of perennials in natural-looking drifts.|$|E
5|$|Although Kennedy Martin's notion for {{the serial}} was {{influenced}} by real political events, he had {{for a long time}} <b>railed</b> <b>against</b> naturalism in television drama – most notably in a 1964 article for the theatre magazine Encore, titled “Nats Go Home. First Statement of a New Drama for Television”, in which he sought “to free the camera from photographing dialogue, to free the structure from natural time and to exploit the total and absolute objectivity of the television camera”. Edge of Darkness producer Michael Wearing has noted that “there is a mystical dimension to Troy's imagination. His instincts are visual and non-naturalistic”. Kennedy Martin, therefore, crafted a serial that on the one hand placed its events squarely within the real, present day world but on the other also placed itself within the realm of the mystical and the mythic. Realism and authenticity was provided by the appearances of real life television presenter Sue Cook and Labour MP Michael Meacher. There was also use of contemporary stock footage, such as Robin Day's interview with Margaret Thatcher and references to real persons like Michael Heseltine and places such as Sellafield, alongside the references to fictitious characters and places contained in the plot. The mystical dimension is provided by Emma's ghost while the mythic is provided by Craven himself and by Jedburgh and Grogan. Kennedy Martin, influenced by John Darragh's The Real Camelot (Thames and Hudson, 1981) which examined the pagan origins of the Arthurian legend, saw Craven as a modern-day Green Man who would confront the threats to the Earth on behalf of Gaia. Jedburgh was conceived by Kennedy Martin as a Knight of the Marches, one of the Teutonic Knights who defended the borders of Eastern Europe, opposed to Grogan, who Kennedy Martin saw as a descendant of the Knights Templar who, according to legend, had guarded a special wisdom in the Temple of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. These aspects would reach their apotheosis in the serial's conclusion in which Kennedy Martin envisaged that Craven, having found the plutonium stolen by Jedburgh, would be shot by a sniper and would be transformed into a tree.|$|E

25|$|At court Archer <b>railed</b> <b>against</b> del Aguila.

The arguments dragged on, but by March 1603 Archer appears to have been vindicated while del Aguila was restrained in his lodgings.|$|E
25|$|In 1840 Brownson {{published}} his semi-autobiographical work, Charles Elwood; Or, The Infidel Converted.

In 1842, Brownson ceased separate {{publication of the}} Boston Quarterly Review, and it was merged into The United States Magazine and Democratic Review, but his beliefs were once again evolving, and he {{found it necessary to}} break with the Review after a series of his essays created new scandal.|$|E

25|$|Woodhull <b>railed</b> <b>against</b> the {{hypocrisy}} of society's tolerating married men who had mistresses and engaged in other sexual dalliances. In 1872, Woodhull publicly criticized well-known clergyman Henry Ward Beecher for adultery.

Woodhull was prosecuted on obscenity charges for sending accounts of the affair through the federal mails, and was briefly jailed. This added to sensational coverage during her campaign that autumn for the United States presidency.|$|E

25|$|In {{a booming}} city that for decades had been {{predominantly}} Republican, fiscally frugal and business-oriented, Johnson's policies {{made him an}} extremely divisive figure. As his associate Frederic C. Howe put it, it was a 'Ten Years' War', and people were either strongly for the mayor or strongly against him. In winning his four terms, Johnson depended heavily on the vote from ethnic neighborhoods on the West Side, where his three-cent fare streetcars operated. In the middle and upper-class sections of the East Side, opponents <b>railed</b> <b>against</b> policies they called expensive and 'socialistic', pointing out that after only five years Johnson had nearly doubled the city's debt.|$|E
25|$|Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg {{occupies}} a unique place in Wagner's oeuvre.

It is the only mature Wagner opera based on an entirely original story, devised by Wagner himself, and in which no supernatural or magical powers or events are in evidence. It incorporates many of the operatic conventions that Wagner had <b>railed</b> <b>against</b> in his essays on the theory of opera: rhymed verse, arias, choruses, a quintet, and even a ballet.|$|E
