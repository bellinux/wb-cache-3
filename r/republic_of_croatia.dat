The president, following prior countersignature of the prime minister, appoints and recalls diplomatic representatives of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia,</b> at the proposal of the Government and upon receiving the opinion of an applicable committee of the parliament.

5|$|On 20 September Parliament {{enacted the}} Defence Act, specifying that the ZNG and the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) {{comprised}} the Armed Forces of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia.</b> At the same time, {{the armed forces}} were formally subordinated to the Ministry of Defence rather than the Ministry of the Interior. The legislation also designated the TO reserve units as a constituent part of the ZNG reserve force. The following day the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> was established, headed by Tus. On 8 October (the day Croatia declared its independence) the Defence Act was amended, with the ZNG redefined {{as a part of}} the HV. ZNG reserve units became the HV reserve, named the Home Guard (Domobranstvo), leaving the ZNG an all-professional force. The ZNG was renamed the HV on 3 November 1991.|$|E

5|$|From 1945, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was governed as {{a federal}} socialist state {{comprising}} six newly created republics– Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia. The current border between Serbia and Croatia was defined in 1945 by a Yugoslav federal government commission which assigned areas with a majority Serb population to the Socialist Republic of Serbia and those with a Croatian majority to the Socialist <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia.</b> This left a large Serb minority in Croatian territory.|$|E

No representatives from the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia's</b> Office for Missing Persons were present at the exhumation.

5|$|In late 1991, the Ministry of the Interior {{established}} the Special Police Department to facilitate efficient {{command and control}} of the special police. It was reorganised into the Special Police Sector of the ministry in 1994 due to the expanding scope of its operations, including planning and oversight of training processes. The Joint Special Police Force framework was set up by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> to integrate the special police into military operations. In major offensives, such as Operation Storm, when the force fielded 3,100 troops, the special police was directly subordinated to the General Staff of the Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that same}} year, on May 14, 1998, the {{government}} {{signed an agreement}} with Astaldi, regulating construction of the ZagrebGoričan motorway by 2000. On December 11, 1997, pursuant to the agreement, the government established the Autocesta RijekaZagreb company {{to take the place of}} the Autocesta RijekaZagrebGoričan company, and awarded it the 28-year concession to develop, maintain and operate the ZagrebRijeka motorway, effectively excluding the ZagrebGoričan motorway from the original concession. At the same time, the Transeuropska autocesta d.o.o. (TEA) company was established by the government and awarded concession for development, operation and maintenance of the ZagrebGoričan motorway. Astaldi owned 51% of TEA, with the remainder owned by the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia.</b> TEA was to secure financing of the project in 1998. Construction began as scheduled; however, financial and legal problems ensued, and by 1999, the press speculated that Astaldi had given up the project, but Astaldi repeatedly denied these claims. Ultimately, the government cancelled the contract and ceded the motorway to Croatian Roads Administration (ancestor of Hrvatske autoceste and Hrvatske ceste), leading Astaldi to turn to the commercial arbitration court in Vienna, which ruled in its favour. The <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> was subsequently required to pay Astaldi 44.3million euro in damages.|$|E
