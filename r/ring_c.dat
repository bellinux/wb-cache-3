25|$|The {{eastern part}} of the {{molecule}} BC (cyanobromide 37) and the western part AD (thiodextrolin 55, with the propionic acid ester group racemized) were then joined using potassium t-butoxide to thioether 56 (through a sulfide ion intermediate). A second sulfur contraction (cyanoethyl phosphine/ trifluoroacetic acid/sulfolane) yielded cyanocorrigenolide 57 with the propionic acid ester group of <b>ring</b> <b>C</b> also racemised. Due to the steric bulk of both reactants this contraction was the only successful method. The oxygen atoms in the lactam and the lactone group were replaced by sulfur (phosphorus pentasulfide/4-methylpyridine) in dithiocyanocorrigenolide 58 and the S-methyl derivate 59 was formed by reaction with trimethyloxonium fluoroborate. Dimethylamine addition opened the thiolactone ring with an exocyclic alkene group in 60 by elimination of the sulfide anion from the methyl group. In an early example of template-directed synthesis this compound was isolated as the cobalt adduct.|$|E

With position 10 sufficiently shielded reaction with chloromethyl benzyl ether produced the di(chloromethyl) adduct which was further converted to the dithiophenyl compound 63 using thiophenol, isolation of which required thin layer chromatography. Desulfurisation took place with Raney nickel and the reduction reaction also opened the lactone ring to the carboxylic acid which was converted to the ester 64 by reaction with diazomethane. At this stage {{the number of}} isomers in the mixture was reduced by HPLC to just two with the racemic propionic acid ester group at C13 (<b>ring</b> <b>C)</b> remaining in 65.
