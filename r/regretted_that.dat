5|$|After {{the battle}} the Grand Vizier forged bulletins in the Sultan's name, proclaiming victory. These {{announced}} that the Sultan <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> his current state of health prevented him from continuing with the successful campaign. His body was returned to Constantinople while the inner circle of officials pretended to keep up communication with him. Turkish sources state that the illusion was maintained for three weeks and that even the Sultan's personal physician was strangled as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|He {{added that}} while he <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> his message had been disowned by Lord Kenmare, that was of less consequence, since his {{manoeuvre}} had succeeded to admiration. Some believe that Sir Boyle, who was related to Lord Kenmare and often represented his views in Commons, was also stating Lord Kenmare's true views on this occasion and doing so with his full knowledge, {{but in a way}} that provided Kenmare plausible deniability.|$|E
5|$|The storyline {{was also}} criticized by GameBrink.Com for feeling {{secondary}} to the gameplay yet being told in long and numerous cut scenes; their amount was {{compared to that of}} the Xenosaga series. On the contrary, Siliconera praised the story and did not report any issue concerning it, although it <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> playing and reading the other installments of the franchise was necessary for a thorough understanding of all plot points.|$|E

5|$|While Star Trek {{in general}} {{features}} few overt references to religion, {{there is a}} clear recognition that a laying aside of past hurts is necessary for peace, similar to the concept of shalom in Judaism. Shatner <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> Kirk's angst at being outmoded was minimized in the final print. A scene where Spock asks Kirk if they have grown so old and inflexible they have outlived their usefulness had two meanings: it was as much Nimoy asking Shatner as it was their characters.|$|E
5|$|Dallin {{finished}} his models in August 1920 and the commission referred the designs to sculptor member James Earle Fraser. On examining Dallin's work, Fraser deemed the lettering crude, {{but in an}} undated letter to Moore (probably late August) <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> due to the tight timeline for production, there was no opportunity to make changes. He suggested that the Mint be urged to allow three months in future for CFA consideration. After the commission met on September 3, a letter to that effect {{was sent to the}} Director of the United States Mint, Raymond T. Baker. The letter was ignored, but the Treasury approved the designs.|$|E
5|$|During the 1934–35 offseason, Ruth {{circled the}} world with his wife; the trip {{included}} a barnstorming tour of the Far East. At his final stop in the United Kingdom before returning home, Ruth was introduced to cricket by Australian player Alan Fairfax, and after having little luck in a cricketer's stance, stood as a baseball batter and launched some massive shots around the field, destroying the bat in the process. Although Fairfax <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> {{he could not have}} the time to make Ruth a cricket player, Ruth had lost any interest in such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week.|$|E

25|$|It {{is to be}} <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> {{these men}} should have escaped unpunished. If the severest penalty of the law was inflicted on all crews of slavers, it would prove a {{considerable}} check to men engaged in that nefarious traffic.|$|E
25|$|He {{said that}} his {{omission}} of his sources was due solely to his desire for brevity, although he <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> he had not written a supplementary work citing his authorities for those halakot whose sources were not evident from the context. He would, however, should circumstances permit, atone for this error, however toilsome it might be to write such a supplement (Responsa, No. 140).|$|E
25|$|Many Rameau specialists have <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> the {{collaboration}} with Houdar de la Motte never took place, {{and that the}} Samson project with Voltaire came to nothing because the librettists Rameau did work with were second-rate. He made his acquaintance of most of them at La Pouplinière's salon, at the Société du Caveau, or {{at the house of}} the Comte de Livry, all meeting places for leading cultural figures of the day.|$|E

25|$|After that, German ceased {{composing}} {{new works}} regularly. Correspondence {{shows that he}} felt uncomfortable with the changing musical styles, such as jazz and modernist classical music. Like Sullivan before him, he <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> his popularity stemmed mostly from his comic operas. However, German was a perfectionist and continually revised his works and produced new arrangements for publication. He also recorded some of them and encouraged their production and broadcast on the radio.|$|E
25|$|Secret {{negotiations}} with Yasser Arafat's PLO organization {{led to the}} Oslo Accords, which won Peres, Rabin and Arafat the Nobel Peace Prize. But in 2002, members of the Norwegian committee that awards the annual Nobel Peace Prize stated they <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> Mr Peres' prize could not be recalled. Because he had not acted to prevent Israel's re-occupation of Palestinian territory, he had not {{lived up to the}} ideals he expressed when he accepted the prize, and he was involved in human rights abuses.|$|E
25|$|The {{book was}} not an {{enormous}} success, but has persisted. In 1965 a review by Bryan Magee for Encounter observed that the book had hung on in libraries as an adventure tale for children, but <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> it was neglected by adults. The review recognised that perhaps its greatest interest was now the insight it gave as to Churchill's beliefs as a young man. The character of Savrola identified precisely with Churchill himself, with what he wished to be and what he later became.|$|E

"I {{have just}} {{finished}} reading 'Afternoon Neighbors' and I closed the volume {{with the same}} feeling of <b>regret</b> <b>that</b> I have experienced when completing the reading of each of your books [...] <b>regret</b> <b>that</b> {{there were no more}} pages to read.

25|$|Lessing's novel The Golden Notebook is {{considered}} a feminist classic by some scholars, but notably not by the author herself, who later wrote that its theme of mental breakdowns {{as a means of}} healing and freeing one's self from illusions had been overlooked by critics. She also <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> critics failed to appreciate the exceptional structure of the novel. She explained in Walking in the Shade that she modelled Molly partly on her good friend Joan Rodker, the daughter of the modernist poet and publisher John Rodker.|$|E
25|$|The report {{concluded}} {{that there had been}} errors of judgment pertaining to the Rwanda Armed Forces, but before the genocide only; further errors of judgment about the scale of the threat, {{at the onset of the}} genocide; over-reliance on the UNAMIR mission without awareness that it would be undercut by the United States and other parties; and ineffective diplomacy. Ultimately, it concluded that France had been the foreign power most involved in limiting the scale of the genocide once it got started, though it <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> more had not been done.|$|E
25|$|Thomson's {{fears were}} {{realized}} when Whitehouse's apparatus proved insufficiently sensitive {{and had to}} be replaced by Thomson's mirror galvanometer. Whitehouse continued to maintain that it was his equipment that was providing the service and started to engage in desperate measures to remedy some of the problems. He succeeded only in fatally damaging the cable by applying 2,000V. When the cable failed completely Whitehouse was dismissed, though Thomson objected and was reprimanded by the board for his interference. Thomson subsequently <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> he had acquiesced too readily to many of Whitehouse's proposals and had not challenged him with sufficient energy.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of October 1939 Reynaud asked for a staff posting under de Gaulle, but in the event {{remained}} at his post as Minister of Finance. De Gaulle’s tanks were inspected by President Lebrun, who was impressed, but <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> {{it was too late}} to implement his ideas. He wrote a paper L’Avènement de la force mécanique (The coming of the Armoured Force) which he sent to General Georges (commander-in-chief on the North-East Front - who was not especially impressed) and the politician Leon Blum. Daladier, Prime Minister at the time, was too busy to read it.|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} {{released its}} final report on December 15, 1998. It documented ambiguities and confusion {{in both the}} French and UN responses. Regarding Opération Turquoise, it <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> the intervention took place too late, though it noted that this {{was better than the}} non-response from the UN and the opposition by the U.S. and U.K. governments to such a response. The report documented mixed success at disarming the Rwandan Army and militias, but a definite and systematic attempt (though not fast enough as far as then-General Paul Kagame of the opposing RPF forces was concerned, in documentation of the latter's communications with the French forces).|$|E
25|$|Byron's confidante {{and close}} friend was William Lamb's own mother, the {{colourful}} Elizabeth Lamb, Viscountess Melbourne. Lady Melbourne had {{been instrumental in}} bringing about the politically advantageous marriage of her son to Lady Caroline, despite disliking both her and her mother. However, once Lady Caroline began her affair with Byron, her mother-in-law began a long and blatant campaign to rid her son of his wife; as Lord David Cecil remarks, {{she had long since}} concluded that Caroline deserved all her misfortunes. William Lamb refused to submit and <b>regretted</b> <b>that</b> his mother had conspired against his wife with Byron. Calling Byron treacherous, William Lamb was supportive of his wife to her death.|$|E
