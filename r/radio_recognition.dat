This paper not only examines interference {{due to this}} noise source, but also that due to the output from a car radio. The speech recognition system, which is a state-of-the-art speaker-dependent isolated-word recognizer, is operated hands-free. Road noise suppression is based on spectral subtraction. A frequency domain LMS algorithm including a modification to control the convergence rate is used to compensate the output signal from the car <b>radio.</b> <b>Recognition</b> tests were performed with several speakers travelling at 100 km/h and 140 km/h with the radio switched on.

40|$|AbstractRecognizing human {{activities}} {{in their daily}} living enables the development and widely usage of human-centric applications, such as health monitoring, assisted living, etc. Traditional activity recognition methods often rely on physical sensors (camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.) to continuously collect sensor readings, and utilize pattern recognition algorithms to identify user׳s activities at an aggregator. Though traditional activity recognition methods have been demonstrated {{to be effective in}} previous work, they raise some concerns such as privacy, energy consumption and deployment cost. In recent years, a new activity recognition approach, which takes advantage of body attenuation and/or channel fading of wireless radio, has been proposed. Compared with traditional activity <b>recognition</b> methods, <b>radio</b> based methods utilize wireless transceivers in environments as infrastructure, exploit radio communication characters to achieve high recognition accuracy, reduce energy cost and preserve user׳s privacy.

40|$|Abstract — A {{cognitive}} radio system needs accurate {{knowledge of the}} radio spectrum it operates in. Blind modulation recognition techniques have been proposed to discriminate between single-carrier and multicarrier modulations and to estimate their parameters. Some powerful techniques use autocorrelation and cyclic autocorrelation based features of the transmitted signal applying to OFDM signals using a Cyclic Prefix time guard interval (CP-OFDM). In this paper, we propose a blind parameter estimation technique based on a power autocorrelation feature applying to OFDM signals using a Zero Padding time guard interval (ZP-OFDM) which in particular excludes {{the use of the}} autocorrelation and cyclic autocorrelation based techniques. The proposed technique leads to an efficient estimation of the symbol duration and zero padding duration in frequency selective channels, and is insensitive to receiver phase and frequency offsets. Simulation results are given for WiMAX and WiMedia signals using realistic Stanford University Interim (SUI) and Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) IEEE 802. 15. 4 a channel models respectively.
