William Kentridge, {{director of the}} former, held it in high regard but believed that it formed [...] "only a partial solution to the questions raised by the Commission. Because what the 'real' people give is not the evidence itself, but performances of the evidence. There is a huge gap between the testimony at the Commission and its <b>reperformance</b> on stage.

In particular, it highlights the literary ambitions of these prologues as texts probably composed to serve fourth- or early third-century <b>reperformances</b> of the play, and explores the disparaging opinion of {{the author of the}} Hypothesis, who considered one of the prologues bad enough to have been ‘composed by actors...|$|R

During the making of the film, donors and actors demanded that a black person be cast in the film, so the network CBS cast Diahann Carroll to appear as a hologram. Inspired by this figure, Acosta lip-synced the words Carroll's character, Mermeia, sang in the film. Speaking to Vice Magazine, Acosta says that through this <b>reperformance</b> of the piece, he explores sci-fi film with a [...] "specific focus on Black American experience, and then how I see and rework that as a queer, trans-identified person in the contemporary world." ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} issue of the production, {{performance}} and transmission of Greek Lyric poetry during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. It does so by examining a representative series of case-studies that include poems transmitted on papyrus, on stone, and texts known thanks to the indirect tradition. One of the outcomes of this examination is to show how, while the transmission of ‘classical’ Lyric poetry, produced up {{to the end of the}} fifth century BCE, normally involved scholarly editions that circulated on more or less standard ‘books’, meant as a rule for a reading public rather than for performance, the abundant, more recent lyric production followed different avenues of transmission and was only rarely meant for reading circulation (as opposed to sung performance, which was particularly popular throughout these periods). The paper also deals with {{the issue of}} the different kinds of <b>reperformance</b> of this later lyric repertoire, focusing on the different implications of cases of ‘diachronic’ continuity in the longue durée and cases of ‘synchronic’ intensive ritual <b>reperformance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Sappho builds her poetic {{discourse}} in the New Cologne papyrus on very specific cultural and visual patterns that through mental imagery help to shape the cognitive reception, particularly in oral performance contexts. Sappho draws on images and concepts of chorality and mythic dancing in a solar context. As cultural symbols they are in service to highlight the unifying themes of beauty, poetic and musical self-referentiality, and rejuvenation. The mention of Orpheus in the new Hellenistic poem O lends additional confirmation to the metapoetic and self-referential reading of Sappho’s poem on Tithonus. Death, night, lament, love, song, music, and the cosmos—in short, all that Orphism represents—are the decisive themes that unite the fragments. The deferral of love becomes its own song in the interruption and continuation of a <b>reperformance.</b> The original pedagogical-didactic reception gives way to secondary receptions, determined by changing occasions of <b>reperformance.</b> In the 4 th century BC the new performative practice even showcases a Hellenistic cult of poets and metapoetic self-consciousness. Cyclic rejuvenation and the erotic poetics of desire and absence are more constitutive than ever. Through its deep visualizing power Sappho’s songs have lived on indeed, even until they have reached us today...|$|E
40|$|One of the preoccupations of Dylan {{scholarship}} {{has had to}} do with his intertexts, where his songs come from, and what meanings they derive from their places of origin, be they textual or musical, secular or religious, ancient or modern. In this article, Thomas explores Dylan’s contact with the ancient worlds of Greece and Rome, evident in particular in the Dylan of the last decade—that is, on the last three albums and in his “autobiography,” *Chronicles: Volume One*. This article counters the attacks of those who cannot distinguish plagiarism—a charge also leveled against the poet Virgil in antiquity—from creative reuse. Thomas discusses Dylan’s <b>reperformance</b> and lyrical renovation and variation {{from the perspective of the}} Homeric rhapsode, who like Dylan himself varies his initial text in performance, so creating constant shifts in meaning and emphasis...|$|E
40|$|A {{performance}} {{is not a}} text, {{no more than an}} experience is an item or language is writing. At its very best a textual reproduction—with the palpable reality of the performance flattened onto a page and reduced to an artifact—is a script for <b>reperformance,</b> a libretto to be enacted and re-enacted, a prompt for an emergent reality. I start by recalling this self-evident truth because our culturally sanctioned ritual of converting performances into texts submerges the fact that in faithfully following out our customary editorial program we are doing nothing less radical than converting living species into museum exhibits, reducing the flora and fauna of verbal art to fossilized objects. In a vital sense textual reproductions become cenotaphs: they memorialize and commemorate, but they can never embody. Even the seemingly neutral and innocuous terminology associated with the performance-to-print ritual bespeaks its underlying process and goal, if we pay attention to what these terms really imply.

This article is {{an account of}} our first performance project using the archive in collaboration with student volunteers and Schweitzer herself, to explore the possibilities for activating the archive materials through <b>reperformance.</b> Through a process of devising new plays from the archived transcripts of elderly people’s memories, and then performing them in local Sheltered Housing units, the project was designed to enable an assessment of what ongoing benefits the archive might bring to the teaching, research, student experience and community engagement activities of the drama programme. The project has offered indications as to how Schweitzer’s well-known reminiscence theatre methods can be adapted for working with archived materials; and the research findings suggest some of the challenges and possible new directions that might be taken, in the continued reuse of the Reminiscence Theatre Archive...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{argues that}} the Kypris Song somehow represents the quintessential poetics of love. Through its self-reflective and religiously charged message, it reflects Sappho’s anthropological, ritual, and proto-philosophical pronouncement of the leading principle which guides her entire performance production. Like a motto, it bestrides general law and a very personal story of affection, passion and rationality, tackling both overwhelming affliction from external forces and the inner strife to maintain control over her extreme physical symptoms through self-awareness and a pure mind. This paper provides a brief analysis of the structure, texture, and meaning of the Kypris Song. First, it presents some recent reconstructions and addresses their problematic hermeneutical presuppositions in a monodic performance setting. Second, it develops some hypotheses regarding the original choral performance occasion as well as secondary <b>reperformance</b> contexts, and third, it elaborates thoughts on the metapoetic relevance of this song. Sappho’s audience envisages her body pierced and transfixed, and associates her with a heroic existence in an antagonistic relation to Aphrodite. Thus Aphrodite somehow becomes {{a reflection of a}} heroic Sappho. The image of the hero(ine) and Sappho merges through the performance of kleos and love, the medium and essence of Sapphic song...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} how compensation type and failure type explain the recovery effect of compensation, using a meta-analysis (Study 1) and an experiment (Study 2). Drawing on resource exchange theory, we propose new classifications for both compensation and failure type and find three major results. First, {{consistent with our}} matching hypothesis, the strongest recovery effect is generally observed when compensation represents a resource similar to the failure {{it is supposed to}} offset, that is, immediate monetary compensation for a monetary failure, exchange for a flawed product, <b>reperformance</b> for a failed service, and psychological compensation for lack of attention. Surprisingly, lack of attention may also be rectified by the other compensation types. Second, consistent with our intertemporal choice hypothesis, immediate monetary compensation is generally more effective than delayed monetary compensation. Yet, this effect also varies with failure type. Third, resource-based classifications explain the recovery effect of compensation better than current classifications of compensation and failure type. As a theoretical contribution, the resource-based classifications help to explain the fluctuating effect sizes of compensation reported in prior research. From a managerial point of view, practitioners can choose the appropriate compensation type for a failure, one that repays in kind what customers have lost. As a result, companies achieve stronger recovery effects without additional costs...|$|E
40|$|From July 1974 through November 1984, 92 {{patients}} with Hirschsprung's disease (congenital aganglionosis) {{have been treated}} at the University of Michigan-Mott Children's Hospital. This series includes 67 consecutive modified endorectal pull-through (ERPT) procedures in children. Fifty-one of these 67 patients had standard rectosigmoid disease and underwent a successful ERPT with only two major complications. One of these 51 children underwent a successful ERPT but died in the late postoperative period from severe congenital heart disease. Eighteen of the 92 patients suffered from total aganglionosis or long-segment disease. Sixteen of these have undergone an ERPT with no mortality or operative morbidity. The follow-up ranges from 6 months to 10 years. All {{of the children who}} have reached 3 years of age are continent. Of the remaining 23 patients, 12 were referred following an unsuccessful pull-through at another hospital. The 12 operations included five Swenson pull-throughs, five Duhamel procedures, one ERPT, and one subtotal colectomy. It was possible to redo or revise the pull-through procedures successfully in all but one patient, who required a permanent colostomy. Finally, 11 children were referred for management of a variety of complications following pull-through procedures performed at other institutions. None of these 11 patients required a <b>reperformance</b> of their pull-through, and all were successfully treated with lesser surgical procedures or with medical management. The excellent functional results and the low morbidity and zero operative mortality are attributed to the technical ease of performing the modified ERPT...|$|E
40|$|In {{contemporary}} culture, human-to-human {{communication is}} becoming mediated through digital screens and virtual communication 1. Our everyday lives are now lived in and between physical and virtual spaces, in a 'hybrid space', augmented with technologies, {{in which individuals}} increasingly perform online as digital versions of themselves: avatars. As a result, 'everyday life' has become 'everyday virtual life' in which new communication practices and social behaviours emerge. This research is a critique of everyday (virtual) life. As with Michel de Certeau’s analysis {{of the practice of}} everyday life in the 1980 ’s, in which the day-to-day practices of human behaviour were critiqued, the increased familiarity of 'everyday virtual life' necessitates new critical questioning: How do we live online? What are the common virtual communication practices? And how can this emergent 'hybrid space' be critically questioned through a participatory performance enquiry? This is an embodied practice, in which the contributions to knowledge are gained through the action and reflection of participatory performance; each raising new critical questioning and an embodied understanding of the critique of everyday (virtual) life: specifically the communication practices and human behaviours present in the digital, which are brought to the foreground through their re-framing and <b>reperformance</b> in a physical space. The research is presented as a textual-visual thesis and online platform, which together reveal the context, methodology, documentation and critical analysis of a body of practice-led research carried out by the author. The reader is invited to view both alongside each other: www. thepracticeofeverydayvirtuallife. com...|$|E
40|$|The {{liveness}} of theatre is a much-debated {{topic in}} playwriting, arts policy, and performance studies. Discussions of liveness, by {{scholars such as}} Peggy Phelan, Richard Schechner, and Herbert Blau, have historically suggested that performance is an ephemeral medium, defining “liveness” as a descriptor of theatre’s transient existence, a phenomenon which disappears {{at the same moment}} it is performed. More recently, scholars such as Philip Auslander, Rebecca Schneider, and Amelia Jones have reconsidered this historical debate, suggesting that performance does not simply occur once and then disappear, but that its temporality must include repetition, <b>reperformance,</b> and memory. However, these approaches continue to theorize liveness in terms of its temporality. This dissertation intervenes in two ways: firstly, I reorient the definition of “liveness” away from temporality and toward affect: “liveness”, from my perspective, is a felt quality of performance, but is not restricted to the moment that performance takes place. Secondly, I analyze the relationship between the ways that affective liveness is invoked in performance and the UK. ’s current socio-economic and political environment to suggest that the increasing desire for experiences which feel live is an index of that country’s neoliberal context. Informing my argument are theorists such as Bergson and Derrida, as well as affect theorists such as Massumi, Bennett, and Berlant. This dissertation addresses several case studies. Chapter one discusses playwright Martin Crimp’s Attempts on Her Life (1997) and The City (2008) as projections of capitalist promises and expectations of a “good life”, following Lauren Berlant. In chapter two, I analyze immersive theatre company Punchdrunk’s Sleep No More as a bodily, but purposefully individualistic, affective experience. The third and final chapter, I discuss ii several multi-form archival projects by performance collective Forced Entertainment, analyzing their attempts to make documentation live. In foregrounding their own liveness, these performances attempt to capitalize on the community feeling produced by collective experience. However, I conclude that liveness has been deployed in these performances in order to encourage a particularly neoliberal form of affective consumption, which privileges individual, entrepreneurial, and capitalistic forms of creation and spectatorship...|$|E
