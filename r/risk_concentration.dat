40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{application}} of the Pykhtin model to the Italian banking system to measure <b>concentration</b> <b>risk</b> by industry sector and geographic region. The proposed approach generalizes the portfolio model used in Pillar 1 for the calculation of the capital requirement, removing the assumptions of the existence of one systematic risk factor and of an infinitely granular portfolio. The difference between the unexpected loss stemming from the Pykhtin model and that calculated using the supervisory formula can be interpreted as a measure of <b>concentration</b> <b>risk.</b> The Pykhtin model is consistent with the Basel II framework. It accordingly generates an unexpected loss measure that is in line with the IRB capital requirements. The proposed model therefore has the advantage of Â“speaking the language of supervisorsÂ”. This approach makes it possible to interpret the difference between regulatory and economic capital. It also enables <b>concentration</b> <b>risk</b> to be broken down into its two components: single-name and sectoral/geographic <b>concentration</b> <b>risk.</b> The empirical results show the modelÂ’s ability to generate internally coherent rankings that are close to the economic intuition: exposure to sectoral/geographic <b>concentration</b> <b>risk</b> is negatively correlated to banksÂ’size.

Against the background of the ASRF model, we determine the number of credits up to which <b>concentration</b> <b>risk</b> leads to a significant estimation error so that the assumption of an infinitely fine grained portfolio is inadequate. We conclude that the critical portfolio size varies from 22 up to 35, 986 debtors, dependent on assets correlation and probability of default.

40|$|Credit <b>risk</b> <b>concentration</b> {{is one of}} {{the leading}} topics in modern finance, as the bank {{regulation}} has made increasing use of external and internal credit ratings. Concentration risk in credit portfolios comes into being through an uneven distribution of bank loans to individual borrowers (single-name concentration) or in a hierarchical dimension such as in industry and services sectors and geographical regions (sectorial concentration). To measure single-name concentration risk the literature proposes specific concentration indexes such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, the Gini index or more general approaches to calculate the appropriate economic capital needed to cover the risk arising from the potential default of large borrowers. However, in our opinion, the Gini index and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index can be improved taking into account methodological and theoretical issues which are explained in this paper. We propose a new index to measure single-name credit concentration risk and we prove the properties of our contribution. Furthermore, considering the guidelines of Basel II, we describe how our index works on real financial data. Finally, we compare our index with the common procedures proposed in the literature on the basis of simulated and real data.

A concentration method with XAD-resins was altered {{in such a}} way that water samples with suspended material could be concentrated with XAD without filtration. In total, 11 stations in the German and Dutch lower Rhine were sampled three times, with the interval of two months. (May, July and September 1990), whereas two stations located the most apart in the Netherlands (Lobith and Maassluis) were sampled every two weeks in 1990. In 1991 Maxau (Germany) and Lobith were sampled incidentically together whith station Eijsden (River Meuse). The river samples were concentrated by neutral adsorption on XAD-resins, followed by eluation with acetone. Toxicity is expressed as the pT-value, a relative value on log-scale, based on the first none toxic concentration of a dilution-serie of the organic concentrate. The scale has been chosen such to represent a maximal tolerable <b>risk</b> <b>concentration</b> at 0 and a neglegible <b>risk</b> <b>concentration</b> at 1. According to the results of the investigations in 1990, the quality of the River Rhine does not reach a tolerable level. An increase of toxicity was measured on the German part of the River Rhine, whereas there was no measurable effect of three of the most important side-Rivers (Main, Neckar and Moselle) on the toxicity of the River Rhine. An improvement in water quality was measured in the Dutch sedimentation areas. In 1991, no significant difference was observed between the toxicity of the Rivers Rhine and Meuse.
