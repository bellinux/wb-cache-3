50|$|While most Mesopotamian {{cylinder}} seals form {{an image}} {{through the use}} of depressions in the cylinder surface (see lead photo above), some cylinder seals print images using raised areas on the cylinder (see San Andrés image, below, which is not related to Mesopotamian cylinder seals). The former are used primarily on wet clays; the latter, sometimes referred to as <b>roller</b> <b>stamps,</b> are used to print images on cloth and other similar two dimensional surfaces.|$|R
500|$|The Olmecs {{were the}} first {{inhabitants}} of the Americas to construct monumental architecture and to settle in towns and cities. They were also the first people in the Americas to develop a sophisticated style of stone sculpture. In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century evidence emerged of Olmec writing, with the earliest examples of Olmec hieroglyphs dating to around 650 BC. Examples of script have been found on <b>roller</b> <b>stamps</b> and stone artefacts; the texts are short and have been partially deciphered based on their similarity to other Mesoamerican scripts. The evidence of complex society developing in the Olmec heartland has led to the Olmecs being regarded as the [...] "Mother Culture" [...] of Mesoamerica, although this concept remains controversial.|$|R

30|$|After the {{post-mortem}} examination, the veterinary officers pass a judgement on {{the slaughter}} stock {{on whether it}} is fit for human consumption or not. The judgement stage is marked {{by the use of}} an edible red marker ink on the carcass that is passed fit for human consumption being <b>roller</b> <b>stamped.</b> The veterinary officers can pass their judgement on whether meat is fit for human consumption in two ways: either passing the meat unconditionally or passing the meat conditionally. The meat is passed unconditionally, when the inspectors have examined the carcass and passed it fit for human consumption without any conditions attached. They can also pass the meat conditionally when examination reveals the presence of parasitic cysts like Cysticercus bovis. The conditions are that when 1 to 5 cysts of the parasites are found, the meat is passed on condition that it is treated first either through sterilization (treating by steaming, boiling in a closed vault for about two and half hours at 770 C or rendering especially for pork) by heat or a cold treatment (freezing for 10  days at −[*] 10 degrees centigrade) of the meat before consumption and the infested parts are removed from the meat as well.|$|R
5000|$|Deritend ware is a {{distinctive}} style of medieval pottery produced in Birmingham, England in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. There are {{three types of}} Deritend ware; a fine to moderately sandy, micaceous orange to red ware (Glazed Deritend ware), used mainly for jugs, with some examples of bowls, dripping trays and aquamaniles, dating to the 13th to early 14th centuries; a black or, less frequently, grey ware with a brown core, also micaceous, (Reduced Deritend ware) used mainly for cooking pots/jars and less commonly large unglazed jugs and skillets/pipkins, dating from possibly the late 12th century to the early 14th century.; a sandy brown ware with grey core (Deritend cooking pot ware) used for cooking pots, dating from possibly the late 12th century to 13th century. Wasters i.e. pottery misfires have been found for all three wares in Birmingham. [...] Glazed Deritend ware jugs were decorated with white slip (liquid clay)lines and applied white clay strips, often <b>roller</b> <b>stamped,</b> and white clay pads, The more complex (and later) decorative schemes are in the North French style (c. AD 1275-1325); The decorated jugs closely resemble London-type ware and it is distinctly possible that the Deritend ware industry included migrant potters from the London area in the thirteenth century.|$|R
50|$|The new {{union was}} also {{joined by the}} London Paperstainers' Trade Union and Benevolent Society, which appears to have become {{the core of the}} Wallpaper Blockprinters' Trade Union, a small union {{affiliated}} to the WPWU. The Wallpaper Blockprinters, the WPWU, and the Print Block, <b>Roller</b> and <b>Stamp</b> Cutters' Society continued to work together in the Wallpaper Stainers' Trade Union Federation and also the Wallpaper Makers' Industrial Council. This council-based strategy of negotiations with employers and avoidance of industrial action became central to the WPWU under Kean's leadership, and that of his successor, Cecil Heap.|$|R
5000|$|The {{collapse}} of the Trade Union Federation in 1951 gradually brought about a change in strategy. The Wallpaper Blockprinters was merged in to the WPWU in 1966, {{the same year that}} Duncan McIntosh became general secretary, and the Print, Block, <b>Roller</b> and <b>Stamp</b> Cutters' Society merged in 1969. In 1971, he attempted to attract more non-manual workers by creating their own affiliated union, the Wallcoverings Staff Association, but this never attracted enough members to be sustainable, and rejoined the union in 1975, which then changed its named to the [...] "National Union of Wallcoverings, Decorative and Allied Trades". [...] However, McIntosh resigned in 1974, following a censure vote by the union's Darwen branch.|$|R
40|$|Caribbean {{archaeology}} {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of unsolved mysteries that still need to be solved. One of these mysteries concerns the subject of pre-Columbian ceramic stamps, better known as ‘body stamps’, which have been primarily related to body painting in previous works. Archaeological and anthropological investigations dealing with the tropical lowlands of South America and the Caribbean have been carried out since the early 1900 s. What has come to my attention is the lack of research that has been carried out on the topic of body painting and ceramic stamps. This thesis aims to enhance our general knowledge about the relationship between ceramic stamps in the Caribbean and the practice of body painting among contemporary Amerindian societies in the tropical lowlands of South America. Methods used in this thesis to reach this aim consist of: (1) gathering of as many photographs of stamps as possible for comparative reasons, (2) analyzing the available ethnographical and ethno-historical information to support the archaeological data, and (3) using the South American Lowland traditions to make an analogy for the practice of body painting in the Caribbean. The use of these methods brings us to several conclusions concerning the relationship between ceramic stamps and body painting. Firstly, ethno-historical sources confirm the practice of body painting in the Caribbean. Secondly, ethnographical research carried out by Kaplan and Overing (1980), brings forward the contemporary use of wooden stamps among the Piaroa, which {{can be used to make}} a hypothesis about the function of ceramic stamps in the Caribbean. Thirdly, by analyzing the stylistic traits and their chronological context, we can determine that the ceramic stamps of the Caribbean were presumably related to the <b>roller</b> <b>stamps</b> of the Middle Orinoco belonging to the Arauquinoid pottery tradition. Lastly, by analyzing the stamp motifs and their relation to Amerindian mythology described by early ethnographers, we can determine whether these stamps played a role in the Amerindian worldview...|$|R
