40|$|Graduation date: 1969 A {{method of}} {{treating}} resonance captures for few energy group calculations is developed using the Narrow Resonance-Infinite Absorber approximation to the <b>resonance</b> <b>integral.</b> The {{application of this}} method is not restricted to this approximation, however, as other approximations to the <b>resonance</b> <b>integral</b> could also be used. The approach presented defines average parameters based on assuming that both the total dilute <b>resonance</b> <b>integral</b> and the total effective <b>resonance</b> <b>integral</b> are the sums over the individual resonances in the energy range under consideration. It is shown then that if the effective <b>resonance</b> <b>integral</b> equation for a single average resonance has the same functional form as the single resonances using the above definition for the total dilute <b>resonance</b> <b>integral,</b> then all parameters have been determined. The factor remaining to be calculated from these definitions is the averaged resonance peak height. This parameter, which {{is also in the}} form of a sum over the individual resonances, is then studied in some detail to see if any simpler form can be found. The first approach is to examine several simple cases representing basic types of resonance size combinations using only two resonances. These studies lead to considering several simplifications to the equation for the average resonance peak height, including a series form, a harmonic mean form, and several series corrections to harmonic mean. The range of applicability is examined and it is shown that none of these forms has universal applicability. Upon generalizing these approximations to include more resonances, several more forms based on correcting the mean value are postulated. Also based on this work, a functional form requiring curve fitting techniques is suggested. This curve fitting approach is not pursued here, however. These generalized equations for N resonances are applied to the resonances of several real isotopes. It is shown that the assumptions made in developing the approximations based on two resonances and then expanded to N resonances can be correlated with the results of applying these equations to the more complicated case of many resonances. This then forms a basis for predicting the behavior of group-averaged resonance parameters...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} estimate the error when the flat-flux approximation is used to compute the <b>resonance</b> <b>integral</b> for a single absorber element embedded in a neutron source. The {{investigation was}} initiated by assuming a parabolic flux distribution in computing the flux-averaged escape probability which occurs in the collision density equation. Furthermore, also assumed were both wide resonance and narrow resonance expressions for the <b>resonance</b> <b>integral.</b> The fact that this simple model demonstrated {{a decrease in the}} <b>resonance</b> <b>integral</b> motivated the more detailed investigation of the thesis. An integral equation describing the collision density as a function of energy, position and angle is constructed and is subsequently specialized to the case of energy and spatial dependence. This equation is further simplified by expanding the spatial dependence in a series of Legendre polynomials (since a one-dimensional case is considered). In this form, the effects of slowing-down and flux depression may be accounted for to any degree of accuracy desired. The resulting integral equation for the energy dependence is thus solved numerically, considering the slowing down model and the infinite mass model as separate cases. From the solution obtained by the above method, the error ascribable to the flat-flux approximation is obtained. In addition to this, the error introduced in the <b>resonance</b> <b>integral</b> in assuming no slowing down in the absorber is deduced. Results by Chernick for bismuth rods, and by Corngold for uranium slabs, are compared to the latter case, and these agree to within the approximations made. ...|$|E

The axial ligand field parameter, Δ, is quite insensitive to the ammine metal (M) and is mainly determined by the solvent matrix. Density functional calculations, together with a simplified MO model, show that: (a) The value of Δ is dominated by the interaction between the filled cyanide π-orbitals and the ammine–metal dxz,yz orbitals, (b) Δ decreases with increasing solvent donicity because the resulting positive shift of the d-orbital energies reduces this interaction, (c) the insensitivity of Δ to the ammine–metal arises because an increase in the energy mismatch between the cyanide π-orbitals and the d-orbitals in osmium compound is offset by an increase in the 5 d <b>resonance</b> <b>integrals</b> relative to those in the 4 d shell.
