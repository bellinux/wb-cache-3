5|$|As {{a result}} of the disaster, new safety {{legislation}} was proposed. The local economy declined because the factory was closed down. Imperial intended to <b>rebuild</b> <b>it</b> and return to production by the end of 2008, with replacement buildings to be completed by summer the following year. Some victims filed legal suits for damages against the owner and the company hired to clean up the refinery. Imperial said that the explosion was the main reason for a major loss {{in the first quarter of}} 2008.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1952, the bonfires were {{constructed}} entirely from fresh-cut logs. The event suffered its first fatality in 1955, {{when a student}} {{was struck by a}} swerving car. The same year (for unrelated reasons), Bonfire was moved from Simpson Drill Field in front of the Memorial Student Center to Duncan Field, near the dorms of the Corps of Cadets (whose leaders oversaw construction). In 1957, the structure collapsed two days before Bonfire was to be held, but students worked around-the-clock to <b>rebuild</b> <b>it,</b> and the bonfire burned as scheduled.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, Bath's abbey {{church was}} {{dilapidated}} and Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells, decided to <b>rebuild</b> <b>it</b> {{on a smaller}} scale in 1500. The new church was completed just a few years before Bath Priory was dissolved in 1539 by Henry VIII. The abbey church became derelict before being restored as the city's parish church in the Elizabethan era, when the city experienced a revival as a spa. The baths were improved and the city began to attract the aristocracy. A Royal charter granted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1590 confirmed city status.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, the State Roads Commission, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Public Roads (the {{predecessor}} of the Federal Highway Administration) (FHWA) created tentative {{plans to}} transfer the NPS segment of the parkway {{to the state of}} Maryland, who would then <b>rebuild</b> <b>it</b> to modern freeway standards, with trucks and buses permitted throughout. The plan collapsed due to the state's reluctance to spend the money necessary to reconstruct the parkway, {{which was one of the}} most dangerous roads in the NPS road system.|$|E
5|$|There are no rail {{links to}} Keswick; the line {{built in the}} 1860s for the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway closed in 1972. Since the 1990s a plan to <b>rebuild</b> <b>it</b> has been under discussion. Some 90 percent of the {{earthworks}} of the railway still exist, but according to 2000 estimates, a reopening would cost £25million. In 2014 the only public transport serving the towns and villages on the old railway route is a bus service operating at mostly hourly intervals. The bus journey from the main line station at Penrith to Keswick takes a scheduled 47 minutes.|$|E
5|$|From 1925, Bayern {{shared the}} Grünwalder Stadion with 1860 Munich. Until World War II, the stadium {{was owned by}} 1860 Munich, and is still colloquially known as Sechz'ger ("Sixties") Stadium. It was {{destroyed}} during the war, and efforts to <b>rebuild</b> <b>it</b> resulted in a patchwork. Bayern's record crowd at the Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against 1. FC Nürnberg in the 1961–62 season. In the Bundesliga era the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000 which was reached on several occasions, but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272. As was the case at most of this period's stadiums, {{the vast majority of}} the stadium was given over to terracing. Today the second teams of both clubs play in the stadium.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} was originally a town house, then a public house, {{and is now}} a shop. Plans for <b>rebuilding</b> <b>it</b> were prepared by the local architect John Douglas in 1873 but were never executed. More modest plans by the same architectural firm, then known as Douglas and Minshull, were submitted to Chester City Council in January 1899. These were amended and then approved in September of that year, and the re{{building was}} carried out the following year. At that time the rebuilding was unique in central Chester in that the new building is no higher than the building <b>it</b> replaced. Before <b>rebuilding</b> <b>it</b> had been a public house named the Harp and Crown; after <b>rebuilding</b> <b>it</b> was renamed the Grotto. It was converted into a shop in the 1980s.|$|R

5|$|In September, the UN Forces {{launched}} another counteroffensive {{with the}} 24th Infantry Division {{at the center}} of the line, west of the Hwachon Reservoir. Flanked by the South Korean 2nd and 6th Divisions, the 24th advanced past Kumwha, engaging the 20th and 27th CPV Armies. In November, the Chinese attempted to counter this attack, but were unsuccessful. It was at this point, after several successive counteroffensives that saw both sides fighting intensely over the same ground, that the two sides started serious peace negotiations. In late 1951, the 1st Cavalry Division, depleted after having suffered 16,000 casualties so far in the conflict, was relegated to the Far East reserve to <b>rebuild.</b> <b>It</b> was replaced by the 45th Infantry Division of the Oklahoma Army National Guard, which was newly arrived in the theater.|$|E
5|$|The {{sport was}} first {{developed}} at a bridge located in Ashdown Forest, {{close to the}} village of Upper Hartfield, East Sussex, England. Built in 1907 and originally called Posingford Bridge, it is considered to be the bridge on which Milne and his son first played the game. However, it is uncertain whether the sport was first played at the bridge then written into the story, or vice versa. The bridge maintained the public's interest and a campaign to <b>rebuild</b> <b>it</b> in the late seventies was considered important enough to feature on the BBC NineO'Clock News. The bridge was subsequently reopened by Christopher Robin Milne and officially renamed as Poohsticks Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Following the 39th Battalion's {{return to}} Australia, {{the men were}} given a period of leave before 30th Brigade was reconstituted on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. Initially, {{the plan was to}} reorganise the brigade and <b>rebuild</b> <b>it</b> prior to {{returning}} it to New Guinea, but in July it was decided that the 30th Brigade, along with its component battalions—the 39th, 49th, and 3rd Battalions—would be disbanded and used to reinforce the 6th Division, with reinforcements being sent to the 16th and 19th Brigades. This came into effect on 3 July 1943 {{and as a result of}} this decision, the Militiamen that had been called up for service were transferred to the 36th Battalion, a Militia battalion from New South Wales, while those who had volunteered for overseas service were sent to the 2/2nd Battalion; both of these units later saw further service in New Guinea.|$|E

5|$|Following the Olympics, {{there was}} extermely {{limited access to}} the {{waterways}} through the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and reconstruction of Carpenters Road Lock was delayed. However, the £1.8 million project to <b>rebuild</b> <b>it</b> and fit new radial gates was almost completed by May 2017, when the new gates were craned into position. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided £680,000 towards {{the cost of the}} project, with other grants coming from the London Legacy Development Corporation and the Inland Waterways Association. As well as acting as a lock, the radial gates allow water to be distributed around the Bow Back Rivers for flood prevention purposes. The gates were due to be tested during the summer months, with a formal opening scheduled for the East London Waterways Festival in August. Public access to the waterways around the Olympic Stadium was also due to begin in June or July.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{ceremonial}} role, the Golden Gate {{was one of}} {{the stronger}} positions along the walls of the city, withstanding several attacks during the various sieges. With the addition of transverse walls on the peribolos between the inner and outer walls, it formed a virtually separate fortress. Its military value was recognized by John VI Kantakouzenos (r. 1347–1354), who records that it was virtually impregnable, capable of holding provisions for three years and defying the whole city if need be. He repaired the marble towers and garrisoned the fort with loyal Catalan soldiers, but had to surrender it to John V Palaiologos (r. 1341–1391) when he abdicated in 1354. John V undid Kantakouzenos' repairs and left it unguarded, but in 1389–90 he too rebuilt and expanded the fortress, erecting two towers behind the gate and extending a wall some 350 m to the sea walls, thus forming a separate fortified enceinte inside the city to serve as a final refuge. In the event, John V was soon after forced to flee there from a coup led by his grandson, John VII. The fort held out successfully in the subsequent siege that lasted several months, and in which cannons were possibly employed. In 1391 however, John V was compelled to raze the fort by Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1382–1402), who otherwise threatened to blind his son Manuel, whom he held captive. Emperor John VIII Palaiologos (r. 1425–1448) attempted to <b>rebuild</b> <b>it</b> in 1434, but was thwarted by Sultan Murad II.|$|E
5|$|Muramasa was {{worked on}} by 16 people, {{over half the}} entire staff of Vanillaware, {{including}} Kamitani as the game's writer. The Wii {{was chosen as the}} game's platform of release as its specs were fairly close to that of the PlayStation 2, the console for which Odin Sphere was developed. This meant that the team could carry over their earlier experience rather than start from scratch learning about new hardware. Kamitani did create design proposals for versions on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but went undeveloped due to budget limitations. Using the Wii's motion controls was tested by the team, but due to the game's old-fashioned style there was little need to implement them. The biggest problem when developing for the Wii was the graphics, especially how to get the various pieces of artwork in the game's scenery to interact and respond properly. They also wanted to keep loading times down to a minimum, which was made possible due to the Wii's area pre-loading abilities. Technical tinkering of this kind went on until the end of development. The game's programmer was Kentaro Ohnishi, whose biggest challenge was creating a battle system which allowed for cancelling of attacks, while maintaining the appearance of smooth attack animation. The resultant code looked so strange that another programmer thought it was a fault and deleted it, forcing Ohnishi to <b>rebuild</b> <b>it.</b> The team was highly dedicated {{to the success of the}} project, putting a large amount of work to make it as good as it could be for players. By the time of release, funds for the company had been drained.|$|E

5|$|Peter {{continued}} to control Pevensey Castle after de Montford's defeat and {{death at the}} Battle of Evesham in August 1265. It became Crown property after Peter's death, when Henry III's queen Eleanor of Provence acquired the castle. It remained with the Crown for another century {{under the control of}} several queens consort, including Edward II's wife Isabella and Edward III's wife Philippa, who were responsible for appointing the castle's Constables. By this time, the silting of Pevensey Bay was evidently having an effect on the garrison's ability to resupply via the sea. Accounts from 1288 indicate that seaborne access was becoming increasingly difficult, causing problems in unloading goods. However, it {{continued to}} {{play a significant role in}} the defence of the south coast against French raids and was occupied through much of the 14th century by a garrison consisting of between twenty and thirty men. These usually comprised ten men-at-arms, twenty archers and a watchman, who were supplied with provisions and armour. The Duke of Lancaster, John of Gaunt, refused to garrison it in 1377 five years after he took possession of the castle, asserting that he was wealthy enough to <b>rebuild</b> <b>it</b> if a French attack destroyed it. His actions attracted public hostility which culminated during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 when a mob attacked the castle, burnt its court rolls and abused the steward.|$|E
25|$|The {{custom of}} purifying or consecrating a {{destroyed}} city {{with salt and}} cursing anyone who dared to <b>rebuild</b> <b>it</b> was widespread in the ancient Near East, but historical accounts are unclear {{as to what the}} sowing of salt meant in that process.|$|E
