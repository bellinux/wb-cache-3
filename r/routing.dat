5|$|M-21 was {{designated}} by July 1, 1919 on a <b>routing</b> from Ionia to Goodells. Along the way, it ran through Lyons and Pewamo, joining its current <b>routing</b> to Ovid. M-21 continued through Corunna to Lennon and Flint. There it joined its last <b>routing</b> between Flint and the Port Huron area. The highway {{was extended to}} Port Huron by 1924, and the west end was extended to Grand Rapids in 1925 along M-16 (later US16). The previous <b>routing</b> through Owosso and Lennon was redesignated as M-71 at this time when M-21 was shifted along the current <b>routing</b> between the two communities. The 1926 creation of the United States Highway System led to the extension of M-21 along US16 to Grand Rapids. From there west, M-21 replaced M-51 on Chicago Drive to Holland. The highway was {{moved to a new}} <b>routing</b> between Flint and Lapeer in 1929; the old route was renumbered M-21A. All in-city portions of M-21 were transferred to state control in 1931 {{with the passage of the}} Dykstra Act of 1931 (PA 131 of 1931).|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 1919, M-20 was routed from Ludington to Bay City, Michigan {{by way of}} Reed City and Clare. This <b>routing</b> was redesignated as US10 on November 11, 1926. M-20 {{would be}} {{moved to a new}} <b>routing.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) rerouted US2 in 1933 between Rogers Park and Sault Ste. Marie. The new <b>routing</b> {{followed}} Mackinac Trail {{instead of}} turning east to Cedarville and north to Sault Ste. Marie; the former <b>routing</b> {{was given the}} M‑121 designation.|$|E
5|$|The current {{highway that}} bears the M-57 moniker {{is the second}} to do so. The first is now M-75 in the Northern Lower Peninsula. This second highway was {{designated}} in the 1930s along a different, but parallel, <b>routing.</b> The first major changes shifted that <b>routing</b> southward to the current corridor in stages. Through additional extensions and truncations, the modern <b>routing</b> was formed by the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The current <b>routing</b> of Bus. US223 {{marks the}} second time the {{designation}} {{has been used in}} the Adrian area. The first was created in 1942 when the first bypass of Adrian was constructed. This bypass was built along Cadmus Road at Treat Highway west to M-52 (Adrian Highway). US223 then ran along M-52 to connect with the previous <b>routing.</b> Bus. US223 was designated along Church, Center, Beecher and Treat streets, the former <b>routing</b> of US223 through downtown. This incarnation of Bus. US223 would survive until March 26, 1956 when another new bypass of Adrian was built. The first Bus. US223 was deleted to allow the designation to be used on the <b>routing</b> of the first US223 bypass. This first bypass became the current alignment of Bus. US223.|$|E

50|$|A <b>rout</b> is {{a chaotic}} and disorderly retreat or {{withdrawal}} of troops from a battlefield, {{resulting in the}} victory of the opposing party, or following defeat, a collapse of discipline, or poor morale. A key feature of a true <b>rout</b> is that the <b>routed</b> forces abandon equipment, especially weapons.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>routed</b> army often disintegrates into a {{state of}} [...] "every man for himself" [...] or [...] as the {{survivors}} flee for safety. A <b>rout</b> often results in much higher casualties for the retreating force than an orderly withdrawal. On many occasions, more soldiers are killed in the <b>rout</b> than in the actual battle. Normally, though not always, <b>routs</b> either end a battle or provide the moment the winner needs to win decisively a battle (or even campaign).|$|R
5|$|The first <b>routing</b> of M-91 in Michigan {{was located}} between Menominee and Cedar River in the Upper Peninsula. This <b>routing</b> was {{designated}} by July 1, 1919. The designation remained until sometime before December 1927 {{when it was}} replaced by M-35.|$|E
5|$|The modern <b>routing</b> of this highway was {{originally}} defined in 1954. Since then, FM1957's western terminus {{has been extended}} to FM471 near Rio Medina, and the entire <b>routing</b> along Culebra Road was transferred to FM3487. Before the current <b>routing</b> was established, FM1957 was also the designation for a highway in Borden County from 1951 to 1954, now part of FM1610.|$|E

50|$|The {{combat system}} is very detailed; each unit amongst {{hundreds}} in an army has several values like morale, hit-points, strength, encumbrance, health problems due to previous battle wounds, protection separately for torso, head and legs, and precision. Most units will <b>rout</b> if their squad takes too many casualties, rather than fighting to the death. Logistics is important, with starving troops {{very likely to}} <b>rout,</b> and mindless creatures like controlled undead or magically summoned beings do not <b>rout</b> at all, they simply dissolve if their commanding unit dies or <b>routs.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{trunkline}} {{was first}} designated along {{a portion of}} its current alignment by 1919. M-61 was extended in segments through 1940, with a truncation {{at the end of}} the 1950s. One change in <b>routing</b> in the 1970s resulted in the current <b>routing</b> of the highway.|$|E
5|$|Two {{changes were}} made in the <b>routing</b> of US10 by 1929. As shown on the maps of the time, US10 was rerouted to bypass Flint. The former <b>routing</b> through the city was {{redesigned}} M-10. A second change moved the highway to its present <b>routing</b> west of Baldwin to the Lake–Mason county line. A bypass of downtown Midland was opened in 1934. The previous <b>routing</b> through town was initially renumbered US 10A. A rerouting project in Osceola County started in 1936. By the end of the year, a new roadway was opened between Sears and M-66. Until the second segment of the project was completed two years later, US10 was routed concurrently with M-66. When the new <b>routing</b> between M-66 and Lake in Clare County was opened, that concurrency was eliminated and all the previous routings were transferred to local control.|$|E
5|$|When M-35 was {{routed through}} {{downtown}} Negaunee, it joined Bus. M-28 northward {{from the east}} fork of Silver Street on to US41/M-28. This <b>routing</b> was moved to bypass the city in 1964 when iron ore mining activity destabilized {{a portion of the}} M-35 <b>routing</b> southeast of town. From this point on, Bus. M-28 has not shared its <b>routing</b> with any other state trunklines.|$|E

Standardized test of software is somehow impossible because the production and control of critical <b>routs</b> is difficult for software with average size. For creating control in the <b>routs</b> Finit Automate Machines (FAM) are used, in order to design a series of grammar and then the language for each <b>rout</b> by making use of FAM. Grammars create a chain sequences which should be followed through the program.

5|$|Before the {{designation}} of SR78, a road known as the Brawley-Westmorland-Julian-Oceanside Highway (connecting Oceanside, Escondido, Ramona, Julian, Westmorland, and Brawley) existed during the early twentieth century. This road roughly followed the current <b>routing</b> of SR78 from Escondido {{to the east of}} Brawley, although it traveled along a different <b>routing</b> from Westmorland into Brawley. No road connected Brawley with Glamis in 1919; it was necessary to travel north through Calipatria to reach Blythe. East of the Sand Hills, there was a road from Glamis passing by Smith Well into Palo Verde, which roughly follows the <b>routing</b> of SR78.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, the <b>routing</b> from Allegan to Martin {{was removed}} and renumbered M-118, and M-40 was {{extended}} to the north out of Allegan along M-89 and its modern <b>routing</b> to a new terminus in Holland ending at US31. By the middle of 1960, the US131 was opened {{as far south as}} Martin; the section of M-118 between the new freeway and the old <b>routing</b> was used as a connector until the next section south to Plainwell opened the next year. After this next freeway segment was opened, M-118 was truncated to end at the freeway.|$|E

5|$|M-52 is an {{original}} state trunkline highway, {{dating to the}} 1919 formation of the system. Other segments of the modern <b>routing</b> were designated M-92 and M-47 at the time.

5|$|NC98 Bus. {{was first}} created running along Wait Avenue through Downtown and met NC98 at the US1A roundabout. This was a {{renumbering}} of NC98 {{as the first}} sections of the Wake Forest bypass were put into place. As NC98 was expanded to US1, NC98 Bus. expanded to cover all of the previous NC98 <b>routing</b> east of US1 and west of Jones Dairy Road. In September 2010 the third segment of NC98 was opened from US1 to Thompson Mill Road with the old <b>routing</b> between Thompson Mill Road and Fawn Drive being torn up and replaced with new <b>routing</b> which became NC98 Business.|$|E
