5|$|Several {{rumors and}} misconceptions {{have grown up}} around the film, one being that <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} chosen to play Rick. This originated in a press release issued by the studio {{early on in the}} film's development, but by that time the studio already knew that he was going into the Army, and he was never seriously considered. George Raft claimed that he had turned down the lead role. Studio records make clear that Wallis was committed to Bogart from the start.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} days of the campaign, Douglas finally began to receive some of the support she had hoped for. Boddy's paper {{endorsed}} her, while Truman praised her. Douglas's actor husband, Melvyn Douglas, on tour with the play Two Blind Mice throughout the campaign, spoke out on behalf of his wife, as did movie stars Myrna Loy and Eddie Cantor. Nixon had several Hollywood personalities supporting him, including Howard Hughes, Cecil B. DeMille and John Wayne. Another actor, <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan,</b> <b>was</b> among Douglas's supporters, but when his girlfriend and future wife Nancy Davis took him to a pro-Nixon rally led by actress ZaSu Pitts, he was converted to Nixon's cause and led quiet fundraising for him. Douglas was apparently unaware of this—30years later she mentioned Reagan in her memoirs as someone who worked hard for her.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>was</b> elected {{president}} in November 1980, Scalia {{hoped for a}} major position in the new administration. He was interviewed for the position of Solicitor General of the United States, but the position went to Rex E. Lee, to Scalia's great disappointment. Scalia was offered {{a seat on the}} Chicago-based United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in early 1982 but declined it, hoping to be appointed to the highly influential United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit). Later that year, Reagan offered Scalia a seat on the D.C. Circuit, which Scalia accepted. He was confirmed by the US Senate on August 5, 1982, and was sworn in on August 17, 1982.|$|E

5|$|Jaruzelski's Poland {{depended}} on low-cost deliveries of industrial staple commodities from the Soviet Union and meaningful Polish reforms, economic or political, were not feasible during {{the rule of}} the last three conservative Soviet general secretaries. The perestroika and glasnost policies of the Soviet Union's new leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, were therefore a crucial factor in stimulating reform in Poland. Gorbachev essentially repudiated the Brezhnev Doctrine, which had stipulated that attempts by its Eastern European satellite states to abandon the communist bloc would be countered by the Soviet Union with force. The developments in the Soviet Union altered the international situation and provided a historical opportunity for independent reforms in Poland. The hardline stance of US President <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>was</b> also helpful. David Ost stressed the constructive influence of Gorbachev. With his support for Polish and Hungarian membership in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and for the East European pluralistic evolution in general, the Soviet leader effectively pushed East Europe toward the West.|$|E

25|$|The Birthplace of Ronald Reagan, {{also known}} as the Graham Building, is located in an {{apartment}} {{on the second floor of}} a late 19th-century commercial building in Tampico, Illinois, United States.

Running an aggressive campaign, Bush capitalized on a good economy and Reagan's popularity. Meanwhile, Dukakis's campaign suffered from several miscues, including failure to defend against Bush's attacks. This allowed Bush to win with a substantial margin of the popular vote, while winning the Electoral College by a landslide. Since the 1988 election, no candidate has managed to equal or surpass Bush's number of electoral votes won or popular vote percentage.|$|E
