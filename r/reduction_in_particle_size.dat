Methods: Solid dispersions (SDs) between CA and PVP K 30 /PEG 4000 were formed by dissolving both compounds in a common solvent, methanol, which were rotary evaporated at 40 °C for 12 h. Physical mixtures between CA and PVP K 30 /PEG 4000 were also formulated as to compare the efficiency of SDs. The physicochemical properties of CA and all its formulations were then characterized using differential scanning calorimetric analysis (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction studies (PXRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Results: All SD formulations were found to have a higher dissolution rate comparatively to pure CA, while only physical mixtures of PVP K 30 were found having a significantly higher dissolution rate. The enhancement of dissolution rate SD by PVP K 30 may be caused by increase wettability, solubility, <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> or the formation of CA β crystalline.

A number of reports have shown that gold particles often have a sharp absorbance peak observed between 500 – 520  nm [66 – 69]. This technique allowed for further assessment of the conjugated Au-CSCaCO 3 NPs size, concentration, and aggregation level [65]. The absorbance band is also known to shift to the smaller wavelengths indicating the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes,</b> and the symmetrical shape of the absorption spectra indicates a narrow <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution [70], thus confirming our conjugated Au-CSCaCO 3 NPs which displayed a wider absorption peak between 500 – 550  nm and highest point at 530  nm wavelength.

Also consistent with Srinath et al., who revealed that the position of the absorption band mostly depends on the color variation, aggregation and surface-adsorbed species [72].

Concurrently, it increased the water-extractable AX (WE-AX) level from 13 (untreated PSH) to 90 % of the total PSH AX While the WE-AX of the untreated PSH had a peak MM of 216 kDa and an arabinose to xylose (A/X) ratio of 0. 20, WE-AX fragments from ball mill-pretreated PSH had a peak MM of 22 kDa and an A/X ratio of 0. 31.

A Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) optical dust probe {{was used to measure}} optical transmittance through the dust cloud at various locations within the chamber. A total of 540 tests were performed, with triplicate tests at five nominal dust concentrations and six locations. The two standard dispersion nozzles (rebound and perforated annular nozzle) were compared. The transmissions corresponding to the normal ignition delay period were used to: (a) determine variations in spatial uniformity of dispersion obtained with both nozzles; (b) make comparisons between the experimental transmission data and those calculated from theory for the three dusts; and (c) make comparisons with transmission data measured in the PRI, 20 -L and Fike 1 -m 3 dust explosion chambers. The uniformity of dispersion for the three dusts was similar with both nozzles, despite the differences in nozzle geometry and mode of operation. Transmission data of the three dusts were all significantly lower than those calculated from theory. This was discovered to be, in part, due to significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> that occurred during dispersion. By measuring particle sizes before and after dispersion, values of 60 %, 50 %, and 20 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> (based on the surface weighted mean diameter) were obtained for Pittsburgh coal, Gilsonite, and purple K, respectively. Transmission data from the PRL 20 -L, Fike 1 -m 3 and the Siwek 20 -L chambers indicated comparable results in terms of uniformity of dispersion. However, transmission data from the Siwek 20 -L chamber were significantly lower than those of the PRL and Fike chambers.

Water pycnometry, typically used for testing soils was adapted for testing MSW using a large flask with 2000 mL capacity and specimens with 100 – 350 g masses. Tests were conducted on manufactured waste samples prepared using US waste constituent components; fresh wastes obtained prior and subsequent to compaction at an MSW landfill; and wastes obtained from various depths at the same landfill. Factors that influence specific gravity were investigated including waste <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> compaction, and combined decomposition and stress history. The measured average specific gravities were 1. 377 and 1. 530 for as-prepared/uncompacted and compacted manufactured wastes, respectively; 1. 072 and 1. 258 for uncompacted and compacted fresh wastes, respectively; and 2. 201 for old wastes. The average organic content and degree of decomposition were 77. 2 % and 0 %, respectively for fresh wastes and 22. 8 % and 88. 3 %, respectively for old wastes. The Gs increased with decreasing <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> compaction, and increasing waste age. For fresh wastes, <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and compaction caused occluded intraparticle pores to be exposed and waste particles to be deformed resulting in increases in specific gravity.
