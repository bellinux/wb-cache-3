5|$|The same Senate {{that had}} {{rejected}} the Tyler–Calhoun treaty {{by a margin}} of 2:1 in June 1844 reassembled in December 1844 in a short lame-duck session. (Though pro-annexation Democrats had made gains in the fall elections, those legislators – the 29th Congress – would not assume office until March 1845.) Lame-duck President Tyler, still trying to annex Texas in the final months of his administration, wished to avoid another overwhelming Senate rejection of his treaty. In his annual address to Congress on December 4, he declared the Polk victory a mandate for Texas annexation and proposed that Congress adopt a joint <b>resolution</b> <b>procedure</b> by which simple majorities in each house could secure ratification for the Tyler treaty. This method would avoid the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority in the Senate. Bringing the House of Representatives into the equation boded well for Texas annexation, as the pro-annexation Democratic Party possessed nearly a 2:1 majority in that chamber.|$|E

AWAs were individual written agreements on terms and conditions of employment between an employer and employee in Australia, under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. An AWA could override employment conditions in state or territory laws except those relating to occupational health and safety, workers’ compensation, or training arrangements. An AWA was required to meet only the most minimal Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. Agreements were not required to include effective dispute resolution procedures, and could not include prohibited content. Agreements were for a maximum of five years; approved, promoted and registered by the Workplace Authority; operated to the exclusion of any award; and prohibited industrial action regarding details in the agreement {{for the life of the}} agreement. The introduction of AWAs was a very controversial industrial relations issue in Australia.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] This paper {{investigates the}} adoption, structure, and {{function}} of dispute <b>resolution</b> <b>procedures</b> in the nonunion workplace. Whereas grievance procedures in unionized workplaces have been an important area of study {{in the field of}} industrial relations, research on dispute <b>resolution</b> <b>procedures</b> in nonunion workplaces has lagged behind. As a result, our knowledge of the development of nonunion procedures remains relatively limited. Similarly, with a few noteworthy exceptions (e. g. Lewin, 1987, 1990), our knowledge of workplace grievance activity is almost entirely based on research conducted in unionized settings. Given the major differences in the institutional contexts of union and nonunion workplaces in the United States, existing ideas about workplace dispute resolution developed in the unionized setting will likely require significant modification in order to understand dispute <b>resolution</b> <b>procedures</b> and activity in the nonunion workplace. Issues relating to dispute resolution in the nonunion workplace are of increasing importance to public policy given the combination of continued stagnation in levels of union representation and mounting concerns over rising levels of employment litigation in the courts. Knowing what nonunion dispute <b>resolution</b> <b>procedures</b> look like and how they function will help answer the question of what role these procedures may play in the future governance of the workplace...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the resolution of}} conflict in non-union workplaces. Employee participation in workplace decision making and organizational dispute <b>resolution</b> <b>procedures</b> are two factors hypothesized to influence the outcomes of conflicts in the non-union workplace. The adoption of high involvement work systems is found to produce an organizational context in which both triggering events for conflict, such as disciplinary and dismissal decisions, and dispute resolution activities, such as grievance filing and appeals, are reduced in frequency. Dispute <b>resolution</b> <b>procedures</b> have mixed impacts. Greater due process protections in dispute <b>resolution</b> <b>procedures</b> in non-union workplaces are associated with increased grievance filing and higher appeal rates but do not have significant impacts on the precursors to conflict. This study provides evidence of substantial organizational level variation in non-union conflict resolution, suggesting the importance of expanding the predominant individual and group-level focus of current conflict management research to include more organizational-level factors. It also supports the importance to non-union employee representation of direct participation strategies involving employee involvement in the workplace, in addition to procedures that provide for off-line representation...|$|R
50|$|The {{solution}} to this problem is that although blowing up the origin does not change the type of the singularity, it does give a subtle improvement: it breaks the symmetry between the two singular axes because one of them is an exceptional divisor for a previous blowup, so it is now permissible to blow up just one of these. However, in order to exploit this the <b>resolution</b> <b>procedure</b> needs to treat these 2 singularities differently, even though they are locally the same. This is sometimes done by giving the <b>resolution</b> <b>procedure</b> some memory, so the center of the blowup at each step depends not only on the singularity, but on the previous blowups used to produce it.|$|E

40|$|The author investigates factors {{influencing}} {{the adoption of}} dispute resolu-tion procedures in the nonunion workplace. Various explanations are tested using data from a 1998 survey of dispute <b>resolution</b> <b>procedures</b> in the telecom-munications industry. The results suggest that both institutional pressures and human resource strategies are factors driving the adoption of nonunion proce-dures. Among institutional factors, rising individual employment rights litiga-tion and expanded court deferral to nonunion arbitration have led to increased adoption of mandatory arbitration procedures in the nonunion workplace. At the same time, an older institutional factor-union substitution by nonunion employers aimed at avoiding union organizing-continues to inspire the adop-tion of nonunion dispute <b>resolution</b> <b>procedures,</b> especially peer review. Finally, the results provide some support for {{a link between the}} use of high performance work systems and the adoption of nonunion dispute <b>resolution</b> <b>procedures.</b> Conflict is an inherent part of the em-ployment relationship. Given the com-bination of common and opposing inter-ests and the ongoing nature of the relation-ship between employers and employees, it is inevitable that disputes will arise in the workplace. The procedures through which such disputes are resolved provide a basic indicator of the nature of governance of employment relations in the workplace. I...|$|R
