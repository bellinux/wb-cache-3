50|$|By 1924, {{the section}} from Tenterden to Headcorn was {{operating}} at a loss. Correspondence with the Southern Railway in 1930 led to Sir Herbert Walker stating {{that there was}} no chance of the line making a profit, and that even if passenger services were withdrawn, it was doubtful whether the <b>receipts</b> <b>from</b> <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> would cover operating expenses. It {{should be noted that the}} Southern Railway were liable to make up any operating losses, as the successor to the South Eastern and Chatham Railway under the terms of the Act of Parliament for the construction of that section of line.|$|E

50|$|The wartime {{depression}} {{started to}} ease gradually although many products were under control until the 1950s. <b>Freight</b> <b>traffic</b> started to increase {{and in the}} end of the 1940s, when 40 percent of turnover came <b>from</b> <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b> There were 49 bus stations and 310 agents. The number of employees was 320, of which almost 80 percent were women. A new financing method for bus stations was developed in 1954. Together with cities and other partners, property companies started to be established and thus, risks were diminished. In the end of the 1960s, the company started to claim to its possession kiosks and cafeterias but in the longer term, this was not an economically viable venture.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Data <b>from</b> <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> {{roadside}} {{surveys in}} Mexican highways are analyzed {{in order to}} find consistent patterns or systematic relationships between variables characterizing this traffic. Patterns traced are validated by contrasting against new data sets, allowing so a pattern’s description refinement. In a first stage truck traffic is characterized with respect to vehicle counting size, month of the year, geographical area and hourly behavior, yielding results similar to those of common analysis practices of traffic engineering. In a second stage the analysis of <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> variables like: traffic composition by type of freight vehicle or service class detected is followed. The prime objective in this analysis is to reveal variable relationships or tendencies of freight data sets providing helpful predictions for decision making under uncertainty. As a second objective, the analysis is extended for the most reliable patterns to statistical inference in order to support hypothesis characterizing freight variables with the typical confidence levels used in decision making for managing and controlling of road <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b> Techniques employed are those usual in the fields of Data Mining and Exploratory Data Analysis: frequency tables, histograms, box plots or correlation matrices.

40|$|Abstract: By {{means of}} {{establishing}} the continuous elastic three layer beam model for track structures with random irregularity {{of the track}} vertical profile, a methodology of analysing track vibration by Fourier transform technique is presented. First, the vibration equations of the track structure are transformed by Fourier transform. The vibration displacements in Fourier transform domain are solved with this transformed equation. Then, the vibration responses of the track structure are obtained by performing inverse Fast Fourier Transform. As an application example, vibration analysis of the track for railways with mixed passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> is car-ried out. Influences of different speeds of passenger and freight trains and different line grades of the track irregularity on track vibration are investigated. The {{studies show that the}} worst situation for railways with mixed passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> is <b>from</b> <b>freight</b> trains. The track displacement and the track acceleration as well as the track dynamic forces on the ground resulting <b>from</b> <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> are larger by 54 – 57, 39 – 47, and 52 – 56 per cent, respectively than those from the passenger trains when both passenger and freight trains are running at the same speed. Also, the irregu-larity of the track vertical profile has great impact on track vibration. With the development of track irregularity, dynamic responses induced by freight trains increase more rapidly than those induced by passenger trains...|$|R

50|$|The railroad's traffic {{consisted}} {{largely of}} potatoes. Five thousand carloads were carried {{in an average}} year. Other farming products made {{up the bulk of}} the rest of early <b>freight</b> <b>traffic,</b> including hay, fertilizer, grain, flour and starch, as well as logs and lumber for Gould's sawmill. During its early years, the railroad made about $60,000 a year <b>from</b> <b>freight</b> <b>traffic,</b> about twice the amount made from passenger service. Passenger travel declined through the 1920s and 1930s. Military <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> became significant with the onset of World War II. Military shipments to the airfield were as much as eight or ten carloads per day; and the railroad began carrying passengers in a highway bus to avoid passenger schedule conflicts with expedited military freight shipments. Freight was interchanged with the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad at Washburn, and with the Canadian Pacific at Washburn Junction, near Presque Isle. Inbound heating oil and coal were important car loadings in later years; and a few loads of road salt and farm machinery contributed additional income. The railroad served Skyway Industrial Airpark occupants on the former Presque Isle Air Force Base after the base closed in 1961, including International Paper Company and Indian Head Plywood Company.|$|R
40|$|The crucial {{dependence}} on intermodal transport {{of an open}} island economy, where almost all external trade passes through the seaports, is examined. The rapid growth of the Irish economy puts great strains on the transport supply chains, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} the principal port of Dublin where major congestion occurs. This adversely affects the competitiveness of small and medium sized exporting companies. Increasing prosperity has seen an explosion in the numbers of private cars, which puts great stain on an inadequate internal infrastructure. A review of Irish ports confirms that congestion on the access routes to Dublin port is the major bottleneck in the long transport chains for exporters. Relief <b>from</b> <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> transiting the city centre must await the completion of a dedicated port access tunnel and interim solutions are needed. In the case of food exporters, globalisation, the power of the retail multiples and peripheral location, demands a high level of supply chain efficiencies. A surve...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In {{comparison}} to North America, railway companies in Europe {{are confronted with}} strong economic issues in running their wagonload traffic. The {{purpose of this paper}} is an analysis how infrastructural and institutional differences affect planning issues and economic efficiency. Method: A particular decision problem <b>from</b> railway <b>freight</b> <b>traffic,</b> the Railroad Blocking Problem (RBP), is considered. It is a typical consolidation problem from wagonload traffic, where transport and reclassification costs have to be balanced. A short survey on corresponding optimization models is given. An analysis of the cost structures shows that the share of fix costs in the total transport costs is much higher in Europe than in North America. The objective functions of the models take this into account. They effect that North American models mainly focus on finding short ways for each wagon, while European ones focus on consolidation and high train utilization. The possibility to t ransfer North American planning concepts to Europe is discussed. Results: Due to institutional and infrastructural reasons, train capacities and cost structures in North American and European railway <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> differ <b>from</b> each other. This results in very centralized railway traffic in Europe. According to the different circumstances, the planning issues differ from each other, too. A direct transfer of decision concepts is not possible. Conclusion: Although the planning issues strongly differ from each other, Europe can learn a lot from North American railway planning models. The potentials of decentralized traffic in European railway <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> should be investigated...|$|R
5000|$|The Bennie Railplane {{was a form}} of rail {{transport}} invented by George Bennie (1891 - 1957), which moved along an overhead rail by way of propellers. Bennie, born at Auldhouse, near Glasgow, Scotland began work on the development of his railplane in 1921. In 1929-1930 he built a prototype on a trial stretch of track over a 130 yd line at Milngavie, off the Glasgow and Milngavie Junction Railway, with one railplane car to demonstrate the system to potential clients. The car ran along an overhead monorail, stabilised by guide rails below. It moved by propellers powered by on-board motors. It was intended to run above conventional railways, separating faster passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>from</b> slower <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b> Bennie believed his railplane cars had the capability of travelling up to 120 mph and would offer a [...] "fast passenger and mails and perishable goods service". Slow and heavy goods freight and local passenger services would continue on the traditional rail service below. Each car could carry a maximum of 48 people, although the prototype had seating for fewer.|$|R
