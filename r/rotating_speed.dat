2500|$|The {{spinning}} frame or water frame {{was developed by}} Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright. [...] For each spindle, the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher <b>rotating</b> <b>speed,</b> to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle. [...] The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length. [...] Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread. [...] The top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight. [...] The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length. [...] The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth {{to be made in}} Britain. [...] A horse powered the first factory to use the {{spinning frame}}. Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.|$|E

30|$|Dynamic {{characteristics}} of <b>rotate</b> <b>speed</b> and output torque were studied, considering they {{can affect the}} working condition and lifetime of the air-powered vehicle. <b>Rotate</b> <b>speed</b> is determined by output flow which is mainly created by extrusion of piston directly during the moving time, and the flow through hydraulic motor establishes pressure based on the outside mechanical load which determines the output pressure of the hydraulic system and then reflects the output torque. We take the average <b>rotate</b> <b>speed</b> and torque values during each working process under difference working condition which can directly reflect the dynamic capability of the power system. What’s more, variances of the output <b>rotate</b> <b>speed</b> and torque are calculated which can reflect the volatility of the dynamic characteristics and greatly affect the lifetime of the power system. In order to illustrate the influence, for the comparison, each parameter changes while other parameters keep constant. Then we get the final results as follows.|$|R

50|$|Flow {{switching}} {{is necessary}} when routing reagents into different chambers. A common method for flow switching in a centrifugal device is {{to utilize the}} Coriolis force within a Y-shaped structure. When the <b>rotating</b> <b>speed</b> is too low, the liquid flow will follow the original path; when the <b>rotating</b> <b>speed</b> is high enough, which is at almost {{the same level as}} centrifugal force, the liquid flow will be routed into another chamber.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of valves is {{the balance between}} centrifugal force and surface tension. When the centrifugal force is smaller than the surface tension, the liquid flow {{will be held in}} the original chamber; when the centrifugal force overbalances the surface tension due to a higher <b>rotating</b> <b>speed,</b> the liquid flow will break the valve and flow into the next chamber.

50|$|In {{order to}} achieve high delta-v, the {{structural}} mass of a launch vehicle should be as low as possible. Liquid fuel tanks can be constructed lighter if the pressure within those tanks is kept low. Typically, for pump-fed rocket engines, the propellant tank pressures (and masses) are 1/10 to 1/40 of those in a pressure-fed rocket. The structural weight constraint also makes the <b>rotating</b> <b>speed</b> of the turbopump rotor as high as possible. For example, the <b>rotating</b> <b>speed</b> of the oxygen turbopump of the Japanese LE-7 rocket engine is 18300rpm.
