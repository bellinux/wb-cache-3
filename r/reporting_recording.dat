50|$|Statistics on {{rape and}} other sexual assaults are {{commonly}} available in industrialized countries, and {{are becoming more}} common throughout the world. Inconsistent definitions of rape, different rates of <b>reporting,</b> <b>recording,</b> prosecution and conviction for rape create controversial statistical disparities, and lead to accusations that many rape statistics are unreliable or misleading. In some jurisdictions, male-female rape is the only form of rape counted in the statistics. Countries {{may or may not}} criminalize marital rape. The Centers for Disease Control and prevention maintains statistics for the US.Rape is a severely under-reported crime with surveys showing dark figures of up to 91.6%. Prevalence of reasons for not reporting rape differ across countries. They may include fear of retaliation, uncertainty about whether a crime was committed or if the offender intended harm, not wanting others to know about the rape, not wanting the offender to get in trouble, fear of prosecution (e.g. due to laws against premarital sex), and doubt in local law enforcement.|$|E
40|$|Sexual harm is a {{high profile}} issue, both nationally and internationally, {{with the number of}} {{perpetrators}} entering and being managed by the Criminal Justice System continually increasing. These increases in the sexual offender population are the result of a “perfect storm” of disclosures, <b>reporting,</b> <b>recording,</b> sentencing and community management. The ever increasing sex offender population places additional pressure on existing risk management services (i. e., Police, Probation, Prison, etc.) already under financial, political and practical strain.. Such strain ultimately means that sex offender risk management becomes about bureaucracy, cost saving, risk aversion and an audit culture rather than innovation and adaption. This chapter will consider the implications of this growing offender population {{and its impact on the}} current risk management system, posing the questions, are we looking at this from the correct perspective and are we getting the most out of the existing system...|$|E

The author seeks {{to answer the following}} questions: What are the effects of racism and the conditions that facilitate it? What types of hate crimes are experienced on campus and how does the university handle these issues? What does the administration do when approached about hate crimes? What actions do they take to investigate the crimes and protect the victims? What is the administration???s opinion about racism and how does that affect the university???s race climate? How do Muslim Americans fit into this climate? Based on interviews with university deans and housing administrators, this study concludes that hate crimes seem to be uncommon on campus because they are underreported by students who experience them and in response the university system needs to change in order to accommodate these issues. unpublishe...|$|E

Quality control includes data presentation of complete medical record documents which covers quantitative and qualitative review analyses. The benefit of a good medical record has is that it enhances the health service administration which records documents related to patients’ health. This research is aimed at analyzing the quality of medical records quantitatively based on the four aspects namely identification, <b>reporting,</b> <b>recording,</b> and authentication of Jamkesmas patients especially those who had sectio caesaria cases at Semarang General Hospital. The research is an archiving one by employing observation method. The method was conducted by examining the completeness of 71 medical records of sectio caesaria cases of Jamkesmas patients at Semarang General Hospital.

40|$|Purpose: Discuss {{problems}} with Continuing Medical Education (CME) and suggest reforms. Methods: Assimilation of literature, personal communications, and experience. Discussions with organizations and individuals, literature review, and extant perceptions in the CME community. Results: Recommendations {{for improvement of}} the CME process. Conclusions: Multiple stakeholders in CME must work together in implementation of change. That Continu-ing Medical Education (CME) needs reform is not news to those who read the educational literature. Classic CME (lectures in large dark halls) fails to produce change in physician behavior. However, most physicians are comfortable with present approaches. During a five-year dialogue and planning effort, 14 major stakeholders of CME in the US came {{together to form a}} Conjoint Committee (led by the author) and agreed both on the need for change and the initial plan to achieve it. Fundamental system wide changes must occur in CME affecting educational methodology and physician capability, particularly in self-assessment, as well as in: accreditation; certification; credentialing; licensure; and credit <b>reporting,</b> <b>recording</b> and funding. The multiple involved parties who “control ” various aspects of CME agreed to focus on the physician end-user and create a revised CME system.

40|$|This autoethnography is an {{exercise}} in <b>reporting,</b> <b>recording</b> and reflecting on the process of attempting to apply a public relations theoretical construct to a practice environment. I take a social constructionist approach where the practice of autoethnography presumes that reality is socially constructed and where I, as the autoethnographer, can contribute to the social construction of what is known as public relations practice. I applied an analytical autoethnographic approach and used my own experiences, reflections and memories to construct myself in my writing as an academic and practitioner working {{within the context of a}} pro bono public relations consultancy project. The aim of this research was to ascertain whether the Framework for Intentional Positioning in Public Relations could assist practitioners to develop positioning strategies for future programs and campaigns. I applied the positioning framework to the design of a positioning strategy for a small university-affiliated environmental organization. My work indicated that the framework could aid in designing a positioning strategy, however, applying the framework to organizational circumstances could be challenging. The framework was found to have two distinct sections to it when applied to practice and this was not evident in previous analytical work. The project also indicated that further research is needed on how to adapt the framework to the concept of emergent strategy. My hope is that this autoethnography shows that even seasoned practitioners/academics can be challenged in practice situations...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc., A Wiley CompanyBACKGROUND: This study {{examined}} the risk of congenital anomalies in infants born in South Australia to women with maternal diabetes in a population-based cohort study of births over a 15 -year period, 1986 - 2000. Differences in the <b>reporting,</b> <b>recording,</b> and diagnosis of preexisting diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus, and impaired glucose tolerance make comparisons between studies difficult. In order to compare published research, details of research methods and analytic approaches are required to understand the potential confounding, bias, and effect modification that may occur. METHODS: Data on congenital anomalies from the South Australian Birth Defects Register were linked to birth data from the Pregnancy Outcome Statistics Unit of the South Australian Department of Health. This enabled information on congenital anomalies {{to be linked to}} pregnancy details, including diabetes status. RESULTS: Between 1986 and 2000, the prevalence of congenital anomalies in the infants of mothers with preexisting diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus, or impaired glucose tolerance was significantly higher than in the total population; relative risk = 2. 01 (1. 66 - 2. 43) and 1. 19 (1. 08 - 1. 31), respectively. This increased prevalence was not modified by adjustments for maternal age, ethnicity, or other demographic factors, nor did the rate change over the 15 years of the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of congenital anomalies was found to be significantly higher in the infants of mothers with maternal diabetes. Larger population-based studies are needed to determine which anomalies are involved and how their occurrence can be reduced. Phillipa B. Sharpe, Annabelle Chan, Eric A. Haan and Janet E.

These activities include measures to alleviate damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused by the incident; protect public health and safety; restore essential government services; and provide emergency assistance to those affected. Scheduled to launch {{in the fall of}} 2009, Mars Science Laboratory is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, a long-term effort of robotic exploration of the red planet. Mars Science Laboratory is a rover that will assess whether Mars ever was, or is still today, an environment able to support microbial life. In other words, its mission is to determine the planet's "habitability. " The Mars Science Laboratory rover will carry a radioisotope power system that generates electricity from the heat of plutonium's radioactive decay. This power source gives the mission an operating lifespan on Mars' surface of a full Martian year (687 Earth days) or more, while also providing significantly greater mobility and operational flexibility, enhanced science payload capability, and exploration of a much larger range of latitudes and altitudes than was possible on previous missions to Mars. National Security Technologies, LLC (NSTec), based in Las Vegas, Nevada, will support the DOE in its role for managing the overall radiological contingency planning support effort.

40|$|The bulk of {{the thesis}} is focused on {{influenza}} A. The current theoretical knowledge in virological, epidemiological and clinical fields is summarized. Acute respiratory infections, including the influenza virus disorders, may be also caused by other agents. The most frequent agents which may be easily confused with influenza are also mentioned in the thesis {{in order to see}} the visible difference between these infections, which are often incorrectly referred to as influenza. The research part of the thesis deals with the epidemiological analysis of influenza incidence and its comparison in the district and regional levels. I have tried to evaluate the epidemiological situation within a two-year period. To compare the incidence of influenza A, I chose the Jindřichův Hradec region and compared the incidence in this region with that in the South Bohemian region. Both areas may be compared in terms of the diseases incidence, since all the data reported to the Regional Hygienic Station are standardized and calculated to the relative number of 100 000 inhabitants. I got the resources for the research at the Epidemiological department of the Regional Hygienic Station based in České Budějovice, where I used the EPIDAT program that is intended to ensure mandatory <b>reporting,</b> <b>recording</b> and analysis of infectious diseases in the Czech Republic, and looked up the necessary data for the 2009 and 2010 seasons. The data reported by general practitioners are divided into calendar weeks and age groups according to newly emerged diseases. However, individual types of influenza viruses are not mentioned, because not every acute respiratory disease is virologically verified in the laboratory or subsequent tests in the National Reference Laboratory are not carried out. Therefore, available data do not provide the exact incidence rates of influenza in a given period and place. Another important information resource was data on the tests frequency and the results of biological material laboratory tests which were conducted in the tracking period in the National Reference Laboratory for influenza. By analyzing available data it was possible to come to conclusion that in the tracking period influenza and influenza-like illness incidence rates did not reach the emergency epidemiological situation, even though in the region the epidemic threshold was crossed, it was only a short term condition...|$|E
40|$|Nursing, as a {{humanitarian}} science, offers its services, on the comprehensive care of patients. Each nurse handling, involves {{the possibility of}} error. Meurier appointed nursing error as "any act, any decision or omission by a nurse, assessed as incorrect, by more experienced colleagues, and have adverse consequences for patients". Medication errors {{are the most common}} category of nursing errors. They affect health, patient safety and also have a high economic impact to health systems of each country. Aim: The present study investigated the causative factors of nursing errors, the frequency of medication errors and the ways of <b>reporting,</b> <b>recording</b> and managing these errors in the hospitals of Greece. Method: For the purpose of this study, a descriptive cross-sectional design was used. The sample consisted of 176 registered nurses, from eight public and three private hospitals, working in the ICU and their duties included the administration of drugs. Data collection was performed using an anonymous structured questionnaire that included demographic characteristics of the sample and closed questions about the factors implicated in the occurrence of errors and their management. To investigate the existence of correlation between demographics and various questions referred to the management of errors by nurses, the criterion of heterogeneity X 2 of Pearson was used and to check for correlation between questions that reflect the participants' views on working conditions and management of errors, the non-parametric correlation coefficient of Spearman (Spearman rho) was applied. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17 software. Results: After statistical analysis of data, the most important causative factors for the occurrence of errors are the nursing workload (78. 9 %), the distraction of nurses (75. 8 %) and the burnout (56. 8 %). More than 9 out of 10 nurses have made errors in drug administration (91. 5 %), especially with the wrong dose (34. 7 %) and the wrong time of administration (32. 4 %). Finally, 86. 6 % of the respondents believed that the official record of nursing errors would improve health care provision. Conclusions: Nursing errors are a reality for Greek hospitals. The major causative factors are workload, burnout and frequent interruptions to nurses during preparation and administration of medication. Although nurses seem to want the official record of errors, much still refuses to reveal any, while in Greece there is no formal mechanism to manage these errors...|$|E
