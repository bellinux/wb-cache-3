Currently known are situations as described by SensorML 2.0 which, for example, allows describing mathematical models for estimating geolocations from <b>recorded</b> <b>camera</b> data such as L 0 swath imagery. Typically, some ground control points are stored out of which the transformation algorithm generates the concrete grid coordinates. This gives complete freedom in defining any sort of grid.|$|R

The research design is qualitative research. This study investigated the perceptions of student teachers to video <b>recording</b> mobile phone <b>camera</b> as the media in teaching micro teaching. The data were collected through in depth semi-structured interviews with 18 student teachers in English Department Programme of Faculty of Teacher Training Education of Islamic Kalimantan University MAB Banjarmasin.

5000|$|M {{had little}} {{success in the}} professional/industrial video {{production}} market. This might {{have been due to}} RCA's Broadcast Products division, which marketed the M format in the United States under the [...] "Hawkeye" [...] brand name, going out of business in 1984 (shortly after M was introduced). Thus NBC {{was one of the few}} Broadcasters to use the format. Weak marketing by Matsushita for M might have been a factor as well. M was also marketed by Panasonic (a division of Matsushita) and Ampex under the Recam (<b>REcording</b> <b>CAMera)</b> name.|$|E

Although the quality was less than desirable, television programs of all types from prestigious dramas to regular news shows were handled in this manner.|$|E

5000|$|Ronalds had a {{very modest}} and {{retiring}} nature and did little to publicise his work through his life. During his last years, however, his key accomplishments became well known and revered in the scientific community, aided in particular by his friends Josiah Latimer Clark and Edward Sabine and his brother-in-law Samuel Carter. He was knighted {{at the age of}} 82. Colleagues at the Society of Telegraph Engineers regarded him as [...] "the father of electric telegraphy", while his continuously <b>recording</b> <b>camera</b> was noted to be [...] "of extreme importance to meteorologists and physicists, and… employed in all first-rate observatories". His portrait was painted by Hugh Carter. Commemorative plaques have been installed on two of his former homes and a road was named after him in Highbury.|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} for machine vision is sketched {{in order to}} discuss current research problems in the evaluation of digitized images. The recognition and description of objects, of their shape, texture, and other properties, as well as a description of their static spatial relations with respect {{to each other and to}} the <b>recording</b> <b>camera,</b> all require complex system-internal representations. This framework is extended to discuss the investigation of image sequences which permit temporal developments within the field of view of a <b>recording</b> <b>camera</b> to be captured. The temporal variation of image intensities can be exploited to infer temporal variations of geometrical relations in space. Although this raises a number of very interesting research problems, this contribution emphasises a different research avenue: linking the results to be extracted from an image sequence to descriptions at the level of natural language sentences. In the field of computational linguistics, considerable experience ha s been accumulated in the construction of internal representations for natural language statements about the world. Tapping this experience for research into the evaluation of image sequences is expected to be of advantage...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine penetration peculiarities of rapeseed oil injected into the combustion chamber of a diesel engine. For conducting tests, a stand imitating conditions (air density) for the engine combustion chamber was designed. The analysis of pictures obtained using a fast <b>recording</b> <b>camera</b> determined fuel injection into the chamber volume and calculated the velocity of spray head. It was established that fuel spray of injected rapeseed oil proceeds deeper into the combustion chamber than that of mineral diesel fuel. The parameters of fuel spray are mainly influenced by injection pressure rather than by the density of compressed gases...|$|E
