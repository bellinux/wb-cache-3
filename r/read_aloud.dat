40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{determine}} how interactive <b>read</b> <b>alouds</b> effect student comprehension with the claim being that they increase comprehension scores. Through the use of observation, interviews, questionnaires, and comprehension questions, data was collected. When given questions after three <b>read</b> <b>alouds</b> and three independent readings, student comprehension scores were higher following the <b>read</b> <b>alouds</b> for below average and average readers. There was no difference in scores for the above average readers. The implications of this study include using <b>read</b> <b>alouds</b> as a support in intermediate grades, average and below average readers preferring <b>read</b> <b>alouds</b> to independent <b>reading,</b> and using interactive <b>read</b> <b>alouds</b> to help engage students and enhance the discussion of text...|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{the effects}} of word frequency, imageability and age of acquisition, on Italian {{children}}s <b>reading</b> <b>aloud,</b> are investigated. Two groups {{of children in the}} 3 rd and 5 th grades performed the task of single-word <b>reading</b> <b>aloud.</b> Children in both groups were faster when <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> high-frequency words and early-acquired words. They were also more accurate in <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> high-frequency words. Children in the 3 rd grade were influenced more by age of acquisition than children in the 5 th grade. Children in both grades were also faster at <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> highly imageable words, but only when they had low-frequency. These results confirm that lexical <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> is successfully used by young readers of a shallow orthography. Lexical-semantic variables have a smaller but significant role...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} pupils’ attitudes to and experiences of <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> by the teacher in grade 1. The study answers questions about how the pupils perceive the <b>reading</b> <b>aloud,</b> what they think they learn from it, and what books they prefer the teacher to read from. The study was conducted with the aid of semi-structured interviews with eleven pupils, six girls and five boys. The study shows that the pupils have a great deal to say about <b>reading</b> <b>aloud.</b> They have a positive view of <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> and believe, among other things, that they learn new words, they learn the letters and the sounds of the letters during <b>reading</b> <b>aloud,</b> but what they single out most is the importance of being able to sit still and listen.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to proceed from pupils’ {{thoughts}} and experiences of <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> in the classroom. There is some research in the field of reading aloud: the <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> that children encounter in the home, which prepares the child for reading, as the child discovers new words and how a story is built up. There is also some research about how school takes over and continues with <b>reading</b> <b>aloud,</b> how <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> in school differs from that in the home, and the importance of conversation and discussion. The study is based on sociocultural theory, which focuses on cooperation and social interaction. The study concerned a class of 20 pupils in grade three. In focus groups they discussed the teacher’s and their own <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> in the classroom. The result shows that most pupils appreciate the opportunities for <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> that occur in the classroom, but want to be able to influence the reading to a greater extent. The pupils wish for more variation between pupil and teacher as regards who is in charge of the <b>reading</b> <b>aloud,</b> and they wish to participate more in the process. The conclusion is that the pupils should be involved in the <b>reading</b> <b>aloud,</b> not just in the conversations about the book but also in the planning of the reading...|$|R
40|$|Why should {{teachers}} devote {{themselves to}} <b>reading</b> <b>aloud?</b> Reading aloud has a given place {{in most of}} the Swedish preschools. Many teachers read to children. Research on the subject has shown that it is very rewarding for preschoolers to have stories read to them. They hear how the language is constructed, becomes aware of matter of text, and they are able to take part of how other people live. This research has been the foundation for my qualitative study. The purpose of my investigation was to find out how four educators who are active in three different preschools reason about <b>reading</b> <b>aloud.</b> Do they practice <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> at their respective preschools and if so, why? What do they believe that <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> will contribute to the child's development? An examination of pre-school curriculum has also been done to see whether it contains any regulations regarding <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> to preschoolers. In order to answer these questions, interviews were held with the four teachers and a review of the curriculum has been done.   The interviews were then analyzed. The result of the interviews showed that all the respondents practice <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> and that they believe it will mainly benefit the development of the children's language. During the interviews the teachers highlighted that <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> helps to make children aware of how other people live and this enables them to bring our cultural heritage forward. The review of the curriculum led to a knowledge that it doesn’t contain any regulations on the practice of <b>reading</b> <b>aloud.</b> There is nothing in the curriculum that mentions <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> as being an important activity in preschool. However, the review revealed that many of the missions and quest objectives in the curriculum can be achieved by <b>reading</b> <b>aloud.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The Value of Reading Aloud” aims {{to provide}} a credible, {{thorough}} counter-argument to theories suggesting that <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> is detrimental to children developing literacy skills. Multiple topics are discussed throughout the piece including, but not limited to: literacy in the classroom, literacy and child development, literacies’ tie to the brain and psychological development. The argument shares theories regarding why some suggest <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> can be detrimental. Theories suggest that while <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> some children are inattentive, distracted, and inconsistently participate (Rhalmi, 2010, n. p.).

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} how teachers work with <b>reading</b> <b>aloud.</b> The aim also included examining their ideas about and motives for <b>reading</b> <b>aloud.</b> The study consisted of interviews with three teachers at the lower level of compulsory school along with observation of one of these teachers during a <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> session. The interviewed teachers work at three different schools in the same geographical area. The analytical tools chosen for the study were the theories of Rosenblatt. The three basic skills that Damber et al. showed children to develop through <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> were also used to interpret the result. The result showed that the teachers have two main purposes for the <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> sessions: relaxation and a structured occasion for learning. Two of the teachers use the project “A Reading Class”. The teachers say that the <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> creates a sense of community in the classroom when the children share the same reading experience. There are usually conversations during the sessions, but most conversations take place during the structured learning occasions. The teachers’ main motive for <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> is the ambition to develop an interest in books among the children, leading them into their own reading development. They want to give the children an entrance to the literary world. ...|$|R

These activities {{have been widely}} used in L 2 learning and teaching, and its effect has been reported in various Asian L 2 learning contexts. However, the reasons for its effectiveness have not been examined. In order to fill in this gap, two studies using a brain-imaging technique, near-infrared spectroscopy, were conducted in order to determine a cerebral basis for the effectiveness of <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> activities. Study 1 investigated learners with high L 2 proficiency to show the difference in cerebral activation between L 2 and L 1 learners as they <b>read</b> a passage <b>aloud.</b> The effect of material difficulty was also examined in this study. Study 2 then examined learners with both high and low L 2 proficiency to show the effect of material difficulty vis-à-vis the learners’ L 2 proficiency. The effect of repeated <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> activities was also investigated in this study. These studies show that (a) <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> in L 2 results in a higher degree of cerebral activation than <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> in L 1 does; (b) reading material beyond learners’ L 2 ability aloud results in low brain activation; (c) repetition of the same normal <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> activity in L 2 does not necessarily increase (or decrease) the level of cerebral activation; however, (d) including a repetitive cognitively demanding <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> activity does cause high brain activation.

The second paragraph demanded autonomy; the third outlined the means towards this goal that were deemed acceptable. The resistance was to be peaceful and passive. The fourth and final paragraph demanded that children be taught in their native language by teachers chosen by the people. The Seimas, unlike the 1917 Vilnius Conference, did not attempt to elect an institution that could carry out these resolutions and act as a Lithuanian government. After the Seimas, rural areas were left on their own without central guidance. After the resolution was adopted by the Seimas, near midnight, Jonas Basanavičius <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> his proposal to include an attachment condemning Polish ecclesiastical authorities for suppressing the use of the Lithuanian language in churches within the diocese of Vilnius.

The only work of his that was published in German during his American exile was a private printing of 250 copies of the Nocturno episode from November 1918. Döblin was embittered by his isolation and setbacks in exile, drawing a strong distinction between his own situation and that of more successful writers less oppressed by material concerns, such as Lion Feuchtwanger and Thomas Mann. In honor of his 65th birthday, Helene Weigel organized a party on 14 August 1943 in Santa Monica. In attendance were Thomas Mann, Franz Werfel, Lion Feuchtwanger, and Bertolt Brecht, among others.
