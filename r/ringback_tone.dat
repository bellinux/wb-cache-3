Social network <b>ringback</b> <b>tones</b> provide interactive social network content to subscribers. Mixcess is the first platform (social network) using IRRBTs in the United States.

50|$|A key {{requirement}} for the Service Broker functionality {{is to be able}} to bridge between the existing legacy networks, and the next-generation networks. For example, if the operator has a service platform that provides freephone (or reverse charging)-type services to its GSM subscriber, the service broker will enable the operator to extend this to the IMS environment without modifying the service platform or the service application. The service broker will also enable the Centrex-type services to be combined with existing GSM services, such as <b>ringback</b> <b>tones</b> or VPN.|$|R

50|$|In 1998, one of {{the first}} {{examples}} of distributing and selling media content through the mobile phone was the sale of ringtones by Radiolinja in Finland. Soon afterwards, other media content appeared, such as news, video games, jokes, horoscopes, TV content and advertising. Most early content for mobile phones tended to be copies of legacy media, such as banner advertisements or TV news highlight video clips. Recently, unique content for mobile phones has been emerging, from ringtones and <b>ringback</b> <b>tones</b> to mobisodes, video content that has been produced exclusively for mobile phones.|$|R

This automated service “listens” {{to check}} for <b>ringback</b> <b>tones,</b> busy signals, answered call, voice mail automated answering, or network operator injected messages such as “the number called is not in service”. This method benefits from being international and covering mobile phones. However, the check {{can take up to}} 30 seconds to complete (average time 9 seconds). This delay can be handled well by the use of AJAX background processes for example by allowing the user to continue filling in other fields in a form while the line test is performed.|$|R
50|$|The {{end of the}} 1990s {{and early}} 2000s were marked by a {{significant}} increase in the world, specially American music in the traditional dominance of Russian music. Russian popular performers in full acquainted with the world of music experiences, borrow a lot of it, especially in terms of arrangements.In the late 2000s, the Russian market of Pop joined the transitional period. Due to a serious drop in sales in the form of physical media (which is typical for the industry worldwide), there is a reclassification of labels to sell music through the Internet (mostly so-called digital singles).By 2009, album sales have dropped significantly when compared to 1990s and mid 2000s due to increasing sales of digital content (digital singles, ringtones, <b>ringback</b> <b>tones,</b> etc).|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of <b>RingBack</b> <b>Tone</b> Advertisement started with patent filings in 2000 by Jonathan Streitzel {{and is still}} ongoing. Based on Seelig’s patent filings and publishing in the Economist Magazine in August 2001, the first functional prototype for <b>RingBack</b> <b>Tone</b> Advertisement was developed by Karl Seelig in 2001. Commercial use of RBT advertisement started around 2008 with mobile carriers Turkcell, RingPlus, Orange's Yesss! and Peter Zahlts.

Soon most forms of media content were introduced on mobile phones, tablets and other portable devices, and today {{the total value of}} media consumed on mobile vastly exceeds that of internet content, and was worth over 31 billion dollars in 2007 (source Informa). The mobile media content includes over 8 billion dollars worth of mobile music (ringing <b>tones,</b> <b>ringback</b> <b>tones,</b> truetones, MP3 files, karaoke, music videos, music streaming services etc.); over 5 billion dollars worth of mobile gaming; and various news, entertainment and advertising services.

40|$|Inadequate blood {{donation}} {{is a major}} public health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study examines the influence of culture and communication on {{blood donation}} in Sub-Saharan Africa, with particular focus on Ghana. The literature was systematically reviewed for aspects of culture and communication that influence blood donation in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, key informant interviews and focus group discussions with physicians, media professionals, and voluntary blood donors in Ghana were used, both to identify barriers to blood donation and to obtain some recommendations for designing interventions to boost blood donation. Literature searching yielded 3020 publications, including conference abstracts. Of them, 41 publications?representing 36 studies?met inclusion criteria and were critically appraised. Aspects of culture that were identified as influencing blood donation in Sub-Saharan Africa included blood donation-related misconceptions, religious beliefs, and influence of relatives. Communication channels that were identified for increasing blood donation included mass media, mobile phones, and face-to-face contacts. In Ghana, beliefs and attitudes of the public that were identified as barriers to blood donations included misconceptions about blood donation, such as the erroneous belief that hospital authorities were using donated blood for rituals. Some respondents perceived that health professionals have not educated the public and journalists enough about blood donation. Another perceived barrier to blood donation was negative media reporting, such as indicating the percentage of blood donors found to be HIV-positive. The lack of mutual trust between health professionals and journalists {{also served as a}} barrier to using the mass media to promote blood donation. To promote blood donation, respondents in Ghana suggested several strategies, including broadcasting radio or television dramas about blood donation in English and local languages to engage both literate and illiterate populations; providing media recognition of donors who achieve blood donation-related milestones; having blood donors serve as ambassadors of blood donor drives; using social media to engage prospective younger blood donors; and using mobile telephone caller tunes or <b>ringback</b> <b>tones</b> to publicize blood donation. Thus, many culture- and communication-related factors influence blood donation in Sub-Saharan Africa. Those designing interventions to increase blood donation in this region should consider these factors, including misconceptions, religious beliefs, family influences, and language...|$|R
