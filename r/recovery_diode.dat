50|$|Microwave {{generators}} may use a step <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> {{impulse generator}} {{followed by a}} tunable YIG filter. The YIG filter has a yttrium iron garnet sphere that is tuned with a magnetic field. The step <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> impulse generator is driven at a subharmonic of the desired output frequency. An electromagnet then tunes the YIG filter to select the desired harmonic.|$|E
5000|$|Pulse {{generators}} {{capable of}} generating pulses with widths under approximately 100 picoseconds are often termed as [...] "microwave pulsers" [...] and typically generate these ultra-short pulses using Step <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> (SRD) or Nonlinear Transmission Line (NLTL) methods (for example http://amsacta.cib.unibo.it/archive/00001623/01/GAAS_98_081.pdf). Step <b>Recovery</b> <b>Diode</b> pulse generators are inexpensive but typically require several volts of input drive level {{and have a}} moderately high level of random jitter (usually undesirable variation in the time at which successive pulses occur).|$|E

25|$|The {{reverse current}} ceases {{abruptly}} when the stored charge is depleted; this abrupt stop is exploited in step <b>recovery</b> <b>diodes</b> for generation of extremely short pulses.|$|R
50|$|When diodes {{switch from}} forward {{conduction}} to reverse cut-off, a reverse current flows briefly as stored charge is removed. It is the abruptness with which this reverse current ceases which characterises the step <b>recovery</b> <b>diode.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{example in}} other areas of {{electronics}} is the generation of pulses where the rise time need to be short; one {{way to do this is}} to start with a slower-rising pulse, and decrease the rise time, for example with a step <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> circuit.|$|E
50|$|In electronics, a step <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> (SRD) is a {{semiconductor}} {{junction diode}} having {{the ability to}} generate extremely short pulses.

50|$|The Drift Step <b>Recovery</b> <b>Diode</b> (DSRD) was {{discovered}} by Russian scientists in 1981 (Grekhov et al., 1981). The principle of the DSRD operation {{is similar to the}} SRD, with one essential difference - the forward pumping current should be pulsed, not continuous, because drift diodes function with slow carriers.|$|E
5000|$|One classic {{design for}} a {{harmonic}} mixer uses a step <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> (SRD). The mixer's subharmonic input is first amplified to a power level that might be around 1 watt. That signal then drives a step <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> impulse generator circuit that turns the sine wave into something approximating an impulse train. The resulting impulse train has the harmonics of the input sine wave present to a high frequency (such as 18 GHz). The impulse train can then be used with a diode mixer (also called a sampler).The SRD usually has a very high frequency multiplication ratio, {{and can be used}} as the basis of a comb receiver, monitoring several harmonically related frequencies at once. This forms the basis of many simple 'bug detectors' where the intention is to detect transmission on any frequency, even if not known in advance. (This {{is not the same as}} a 'rake' receiver which is a correlation device.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{figure on}} the right shows a typical pulse {{generated}} by gain-switching with a sinusoidal injection current at 250 MHz producing a pulse of approximately 50 ps. The carrier density is depleted during the pulse, and subsequently rises due to continued current injection, producing a smaller secondary pulse. If the injection current is rapidly switched off at the proper time, for example using a step <b>recovery</b> <b>diode</b> circuit, a single 50 ps light pulse can be generated.|$|E

50|$|YIG {{multipliers}} often want {{to select}} an arbitrary harmonic, so {{they use a}} stateful distortion circuit that converts the input sine wave into an approximate impulse train. The ideal (but impractical) impulse train generates {{an infinite number of}} (weak) harmonics. In practice, an impulse train generated by a monostable circuit will have many usable harmonics. YIG multipliers using step <b>recovery</b> <b>diodes</b> may, for example, take an input frequency of 1 to 2 GHz and produce outputs up to 18 GHz. Sometimes the frequency multiplier circuit will adjust the width of the impulses to improve conversion efficiency for a specific harmonic.|$|R

Both ultra-short output pulses (with different polarity) are well approximated by a Gaussian function and show a width t p of about 50 ps and an amplitude of 3. 4 V, {{resulting in an}} amplitude at the differential output of 6. 8 V. Such short pulses are essential in sub-sampling TDR systems as t p limits the bandwidth and thus {{the resolution of the}} measurement applications.

40|$|AbstractThe incessant {{involving}} {{of smart}} grids associated with renewable energies increases the demand in high efficiency converters. So {{it is important}} to consider all possible improvements involving reliability and simple structures. In this study we demonstrate the improvement potentiality of a DC/DC step-up converter, connected to a HVDC bus, based on a MCB-RS model (Magnetically Coupled Boost with Recovery Stage). We suggest a new possibility of improvement of the converter by mastering its active switch allowing an easier control of the internal voltage inherent to the recovery stage. The suggested solution permits a saving of the internal energy and prevents the over heating of certain components, like <b>recovery</b> <b>diode.</b> In the MCB-RS converter, the losses are for a main part dissipated in the <b>recovery</b> <b>diode,</b> representing a non-negligible amount of power. Thus, we propose to save this energy by the insertion in the recovery circuit of an additional parallel switch. This solution offers an additional advantage by making possible the flow back of a certain amount of energy by keeping in the on state the parallel switch. Finally we compare the simulated results with a real system and validate this new performing structure...|$|E

40|$|PiN diodes {{are known}} to {{significantly}} contribute to switching energy {{as a result of}} reverse-recovery charge during turn-off. At high switching rates, the overlap between the high peak reserve-recovery current and the high peak voltage overshoot contributes to significant switching energy. The peak reverse-recovery current depends on the temperature and switching rate, whereas the peak diode voltage overshoot depends additionally on the stray inductance. Furthermore, the slope of the diode turn-off current is constant at high insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) switching rates and varies for low IGBT switching rates. In this paper, an analytical model for calculating PiN diode switching energy at different switching rates and temperatures is presented and validated by ultrafast and standard <b>recovery</b> <b>diodes</b> with different current ratings. Measurements of current commutation in IGBT/PiN diode pairs have been made at different switching rates and temperatures and used to validate the model.
