40|$|This work {{provides}} {{single cell}} durability tests of membrane electrode assemblies in dynamic operation regularly interrupted by recovery {{procedures for the}} removal of <b>reversible</b> <b>voltage</b> losses. Degradation rates at different loads in one single test can be determined from these tests. Hence, it is possible to report degradation rates versus current density instead of a single degradation rate value. A clear discrimination between reversible and irreversible voltage loss rates is provided. The irreversible degradation rate can be described by a linear regression of voltage values after the recovery steps. Using voltage values before refresh is less adequate due to possible impacts of reversible effects. The reversible contribution to the voltage decay is dominated by an exponential decay after restart, eventually turning into a linear one. A linear-exponential function is proposed to fit the <b>reversible</b> <b>voltage</b> degradation. Due to this function, the Degradation behavior of an automotive fuel cell can be described correctly during the first hours after restart. The fit parameters decay constant, exponential amplitude and linear slope are evaluated.

Analytical methods for the determination of component degradation will be presented and a new systematic approach {{for the analysis of}} reversible and irreversible degradation rates in an operating fuel cell will be introduced. A detailed description of voltage loss rates and particularly of the discrimination between <b>reversible</b> and irreversible <b>voltage</b> losses will be given. A major motivation of the presented work is the lack of common description procedures and determination approaches of voltage losses in durability tests of fuel cell. This issue results in severe difficulties in the comparison of results obtained by different testing facilities or within different research projects especially if only one value for a degradation rate is reported. In order to systematically analyze voltage losses we have performed single cell durability measurements of several hundreds of hours in 25 cm 2 lab-scale cells. Specific test protocols containing regular refresh procedures were used for this purpose (see Figure 1). This enables distinguishing between <b>reversible</b> and irreversible <b>voltage</b> losses. To test the refresh procedures and analyze their effect on cell performance, parameters such as the duration of e. g. a soak time step have been varied. Between these refresh steps the cells were typically operated for 50 to 150 h. Conventional 5 -layer MEAs with PFSA membranes, carbon supported Pt-catalysts and hydrophobized carbon fiber substrates with micro porous layers as GDLs were used for this study. For in-situ diagnostics of the operated cells polarization curves, impedance spectra, and CVs were recorded {{in order to determine the}} impact of the refresh procedures on the cells. Ex-situ methods were used to determine the causes for the <b>reversible</b> and irreversible <b>voltage</b> losses.

Since IK,n can be blocked by linopirdine, cholinergic effects might be better revealed in the presence of this compound. The aim of the present work was to study the effects of linopirdine on the ACh-evoked responses through α 9 α 10 -containing native and recombinant nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Responses to ACh were blocked by linopirdine in both OHCs and inner hair cells (IHCs) of rats at postnatal days 21 – 27 (OHCs) and 9 – 11 (IHCs). In addition, linopirdine blocked responses of recombinant α 9 α 10 nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChRs) in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC 50 of 5. 2  μM.

40|$|AbstractThe mitochondria-rich (mr) cell of {{amphibian}} skin epithelium is differentiated as {{a highly}} specialised pathway for passive transepithelial transport of chloride. The apical membrane of mr cells expresses several types of Cl− channels, of which the function of only two types has been studied in detail. (i) One type of channel is gated by voltage and external chloride concentration. This intriguing type of regulation leads to opening of channels only if [Cl−]o is in the millimolar range and if the electrical potential is of a polarity that secures an inwardly directed net flux of this ion. <b>Reversible</b> <b>voltage</b> activations of the conductance proceed with long time constants, which depend on V {{in such a way}} that the rate of conductance activation increases when V is clamped at more negative values (serosal bath grounded). The gating seems to involve processes that are dependent on F-actin localised in the submembrane domain in the neck region of the flask-shaped mr cell. (ii) The other identified Cl− pathway of mr cells is mediated by small-conductance apical CFTR chloride channels as concluded from its activation via β-adrenergic receptors, ion selectivity, genistein stimulation and inhibition by glibenclamide. bbCFTR has been cloned, and immunostaining has shown that the gene product is selectively expressed in mr cells.

We found that extracellular application of 10 - 20 μM Zn 2 + induced a reversible abolition of Ca 2 + action potential firing, which {{was accompanied by}} an hyperpolarisation of the resting membrane potential. Higher concentrations of Zn 2 +, in the tens to hundreds micromolar range, induced a reversible reduction of voltage-gated Ca 2 + and, to a lesser extent, K+ currents. Low-voltage-activated Ca 2 + currents were more sensitive to Zn 2 + block than high voltage-activated Ca 2 + currents. The Zn 2 +-induced hyperpolarisation arose from a dose-dependent increase in a voltage-independent K+ conductance that was pharmacologically identified as an ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) conductance. The effect was rapid in onset, readily <b>reversible,</b> <b>voltage</b> independent, and related to intracellular ATP concentration. In the presence of 1 mM intracellular ATP, half-maximal activation of KATP channels was obtained with extracellular application of 1. 7 μM Zn 2 +. Single channel analysis revealed that extracellular Zn 2 + increased the KATP channel open-state probability with {{no change in the}} single channel conductance. Our data support the hypothesis that Zn 2 + binding to KATP protein subunits results in an activation of the channels, therefore regulating the resting membrane potential and decreasing the excitability of RINm 5 F cells.

40|$|Two {{classes of}} {{amphiphilic}} compounds, lysophospholipids and arachidonic acid, {{have been suggested}} to produce opposite deformations of the lipid bilayer. We have found that their effects on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) responses are opposite, and resemble those of mechanical deformations of the plasma membrane. Lysophospholipids inhibited NMDA responses both in nucleated patches taken from cultured neurons and in cells expressing recombinant NMDA receptors. This inhibition was <b>reversible,</b> <b>voltage</b> independent and stronger at non-saturating doses of agonist. It was not linked {{to the charge of}} the polar head, and was not mimicked by lysophosphatidic acid or phosphatidylcholine. In outside-out patches, lysophospholipids reduced the open probability of NMDA-activated channels without changing their single-channel conductance. The inhibition produced by lysophospholipids occluded that produced by a mechanical compression induced by changes in osmotic or hydrostatic pressure. The potentiation of NMDA responses by arachidonic acid was observed both in native and recombinant receptors, including those in which the putative ‘fatty acid binding domain’ had been deleted. This suggests that, like lysophospholipids, arachidonic acid alters the NMDA receptor by insertion into the lipid bilayer. Recombinant receptors in which the cytoplasmic tails had been modified or deleted were still sensitive to mechanical deformation. A linkage to the cytoskeleton is therefore not required for NMDA receptor mechanosensitivity. The fact that the NMDA responses are depressed similarly by compression and lysophospholipids, and potentiated similarly by stretch and arachidonic acid supports the notion that the modulation of NMDA receptor activity by asymmetrical amphiphilic compounds involves pressure changes transmitted through the lipid bilayer. Compounds with a large hydrophilic head mimic the effects of a compression, and compounds with a small hydrophilic head mimic the effects of stretch...|$|E

During the operation when the anode exit is shut, gases that cross-over from the cathode accumulate and stratify in the anode channels above the liquid water when the gravity is {{acting in the}} flow direction. In this work, we present a transient two-dimensional along the channel model and simulations of the PEMFC operating with a dead-ended anode. The transport of gas species in flow channels and gas diffusion layers is modeled by Maxwell-Stefan equations. Flow in the channels is modeled by laminarized Navier-Stokes equations, where the inertial terms are dropped from the force balance, but the buoyancy effect due to the variation of the composition of gas mixture is included at the anode side. Flow in the gas diffusion layers is modeled by Darcy’s Law. Permeation of nitrogen in the membrane is considered since it can accumulate in the anode as opposed to instant reaction of oxygen (hydrogen) at the anode (cathode) catalyst layer(s). The membrane is considered as a resistance (interface) to transport of water vapor and nitrogen. Ohm’s Law is used to model the transport of charged particles, i. e. electrons in the electrodes and flow plates and protons in the membrane.

As the resistance increases with increasing flow, some energy is loss in the process which causes diffusion overvoltage. The cell voltage to be imposed is higher because of mass transport limitations. In PEM electrolyzer, the cell voltage is generally the sum of <b>reversible</b> <b>voltage</b> and the overpotentials. The ohmic, activation and mass transfer losses are the most prominent losses in a PEM electrolyser. In this manuscript, mathematical models related to PEM electrolyzer based {{on a combination of}} thermodynamics fundamental and electrochemical relations are presented. A single cell simple PEM electrolyzer is analyzed on the basis ofwell-known Butler- Volmer kinetic for electrodes and transport resistance in the polymer-electrolyte. In addition, the overpotential at the anode, cathode and overpotential due to ohmic resistances are analyzed as well. Then, the effect of temperature on operating cell voltage, resistance and ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte are examined with the developed model. Finally sensitivity analysis for different values of exchange current densities at anode and cathode are tested. The simulation results indicated that as temperature increases, there is a significant or sharp decrease in ohmic resistance from 0. 198 Ω/cm² at 40 °C to 0. 125 Ω/ cm² at 80 °C. Also at 40 °C and 2 A/ cm², an operating voltage of 2. 13 V has seen achieved, however at higher temperature (80 °C), the operating cell voltage drops to 1. 98 V at 2 A/ cm² and this constitutes about 7 % reduction in operating cell voltage.

40|$|Abstract—This paper unifies power {{optimization}} {{approaches in}} various energy converters, such as: thermal, solar, chemical, and electrochemical engines, in particular fuel cells. Thermodynamics leads to converter’s efficiency and limiting power. Efficiency equations serve {{to solve problems}} of upgrading and downgrading of resources. While optimization of steady systems applies the differential calculus and Lagrange multipliers, dynamic optimization involves variational calculus and dynamic programming. In reacting systems chemical affinity constitutes a prevailing component of an overall efficiency, thus the power is analyzed {{in terms of an}} active part of chemical affinity. The main novelty of the present paper in the energy yield context consists in showing that the generalized heat flux Q (involving the traditional heat flux q plus the product of temperature and the sum products of partial entropies and fluxes of species) plays in complex cases (solar, chemical and electrochemical) the same role as the traditional heat q in pure heat engines. The presented methodology is also applied to power limits in fuel cells as to systems which are electrochemical flow engines propelled by chemical reactions. The performance of fuel cells is determined by magnitudes and directions of participating streams and mechanism of electric current generation. Voltage lowering below the <b>reversible</b> <b>voltage</b> is a proper measure of cells imperfection. The voltage losses, called polarization, include the contributions of three main sources: activation, ohmic and concentration. Examples show power maxima in fuel cells and prove the relevance of the extension of the thermal machine theory to chemical and electrochemical systems. The main novelty of the present paper in the FC context consists in introducing an effective or reduced Gibbs free energy change between products p and reactants s which take into account the decrease of voltage and power caused by the incomplete conversion of the overall reaction.

40|$|Our {{presentation}} {{focuses on}} investigations of durability and of degradation of fuel cells at low Pt loadings for automotive application. Major motivations are {{problems related to}} the need {{to reduce the amount of}} Pt in MEAs down to values of e. g. 0. 2 mgPt/cm 2 in order to make PEMFC more competitive. The particular challenge is to maintain sufficiently high performance and long-term durability. Both requirements, however, are conflicting with the reduction of Pt loading. In this context, our study regarding the influence of Pt loading on PEMFC performance and on durability shows that for cathode loadings below 0. 2 mgPt/cm 2 and for current densities exceeding 1 A/cm 2 a sudden increase of mass transport resistance is observed. The same threshold value is found for the increase of irreversible voltage losses which lead to a dramatic reduction of PEMFC durability for cathodic loadings below 0. 2 mgPt/cm 2. Another durability issue at low cathodic Pt-loadings (< 0. 4 mgPt/cm 2) is the acceleration of reversible degradation, which leads to a dramatic voltage drop at fuel cell operation (without a recovery interruption). Such an increased reversible degradation is less important for automotive application where regular refresh (recovery of reversible losses) is performed by shutting down the system. Nevertheless, the accelerated <b>reversible</b> <b>voltage</b> decay may be very significant and is, of course, related to irreversible material changes that should not be neglected. A further aspect of this presentation is the lack of common procedures to reliably determine voltage loss rates in durability tests of fuel cell. This issue leads to severe difficulties in the comparison of results obtained by different institutions or within different projects. Accordingly, special attention is devoted to the discrimination between so called reversible and irreversible voltage losses. The first are permanent and determine the lifetime of a fuel cell. The latter strongly depends on the chosen operation conditions and can be recovered by specific procedures...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} reports {{work performed}} at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{that resulted in a}} major accomplishment by demonstrating the proof-of-concept of the use of a proton exchange membrane or PEM-type electrochemical cell to produce hydrogen via SO{sub 2 }-depolarized water electrolysis. For the first time sulfur dioxide dissolved in liquid sulfuric acid was used to depolarize water electrolysis in a modern PEM cell. The use of such a cell represents a major step in achieving the ultimate goal of an economical hydrogen production process based on the Hybrid Sulfur (HyS) Cycle. The HyS Process is a hybrid thermochemical cycle that may be used in conjunction with advanced nuclear reactors or centralized solar receivers to produce hydrogen by water-splitting. Like all other sulfur-based cycles, HyS utilizes the high temperature thermal decomposition of sulfuric acid to produce oxygen. The unique aspect of HyS is the generation of hydrogen in a water electrolyzer that is operated under conditions where dissolved sulfur dioxide depolarizes the anodic reaction, resulting in substantial voltage reduction. Sulfur dioxide is oxidized at the anode, producing sulfuric acid, that is sent to the acid decomposition portion of the cycle. The focus of this work was to conduct single cell electrolyzer tests in order to prove the concept of SO{sub 2 }-depolarization and to determine how the results can be used to evaluate the performance of key components of the HyS Process. A test facility for conducting SO{sub 2 }-depolarized electrolyzer (SDE) testing was designed, constructed and commissioned. The maximum cell current is 50 amperes, which is equivalent to a hydrogen production rate of approximately 20 liters per hour. The test facility was designed for operation at room temperature with pressures up to 2 bar. Feed to the anode of the electrolyzer can be water, sulfuric acid of various concentrations, or sulfuric acid containing dissolved sulfur dioxide. Provisions are included to allow variation of the operating pressure in the range of 1 to 2 bar. Hydrogen generated at the cathode of the cell can be collected for the purpose of flow measurement and composition analysis. The test facility proved to be easy to operate, versatile, and reliable. Two slightly different SDE's were designed, procured and tested. The first electrolyzer was based on a commercially available PEM water electrolyzer manufactured by Proton Energy Systems, Inc. (PES). The PES electrolyzer was built with Hastelloy B and Teflon wetted parts, a PEM electrolyte, and porous titanium electrodes. The second electrolyzer was assembled for SRNL by the University of South Carolina (USC). It was constructed with platinized carbon cloth electrodes, a Nafion 115 PEM electrolyte, carbon paper flow fields, and solid graphite back plates. Proof-of-concept testing was performed on each electrolyzer at near-ambient pressure and room temperature under various feed conditions. SDE operation was evidenced by hydrogen production at the cathode and sulfuric acid production at the anode (witnessed by the absence of oxygen generation) and with cell voltages substantially less than the theoretical <b>reversible</b> <b>voltage</b> for simple water electrolysis (1. 23 V). Cell performance at low currents equaled or exceeded that achieved in the two-compartment cells built by Westinghouse Electric Corporation during the original development of the HyS Process. Performance at higher currents was less efficient due to mass transfer and hydraulic issues {{associated with the use of}} cells not optimized for liquid feed. Test results were analyzed to determine performance trends, improvement needs, and long-term SDE potential. The PES cell failed after several days of operation due to internal corrosion of the titanium electrodes in the presence of sulfuric acid. Although it was anticipated that the titanium would react in the presence of acid, the rapid deterioration of the electrodes was unexpected. The USC cell was constructed of carbon-based components and had excellent corrosion resistance. However, it was a modified design originally based on gaseous reactants, and it had poor mass transfer characteristics when using liquid sulfuric acid feed with dissolved sulfur dioxide. This resulted in substantially increased polarization losses at higher current densities. Future work will focus on operation at higher temperature and pressure, as well as improved cell designs specifically considering the unique flow conditions for SDE operation...|$|E
