Other sources indicate that sisters Christine and Margarethe Kirsch assisted him. Christine is known for carefully keeping a diary of the weather for many years.

Our righteous “hero”, ie, the Research Integrity Editor, is in his tent, ie, the offices of the Croatian Medical Journal (CMJ). By a signal fire he’s been warned of another foe (a reviewer/co-editor has red-flagged a manuscript, instantly turning it into a “case”). A foe gaining in strength and number (hopefully not), a dark Lord whose forces are in the valley below, hidden by the fog and the rain (obfuscation of actual author contributions). But the hero has lit his torch, ie, computers with access to the journal’s databases and PubMed (1), WAME (2), ORI (3), and COPE (4) websites, sharpened his sword (gathered what little wit he has), and is ready to overcome (well, at least investigate, process, and advise) another foe, another arch-enemy (a possible case of research/publication misconduct). Ah, what a feat! It seems another skirmish is ahead. But greater things are at stake. Is our hero going to make it? Will righteousness prevail? Will he win the battle? Can it be won?
