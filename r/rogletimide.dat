50|$|<b>Rogletimide,</b> {{also known}} as pyridoglutethimide, is a drug related in {{chemical}} structure to the sedative glutethimide, but instead having pharmacological activity as a selective aromatase inhibitor similar to the related drug aminoglutethimide, but with no significant sedative effect. This makes it potentially useful {{in the treatment of}} some forms of cancer, and with less side effects than aminoglutethimide, but its lower potency caused it to be unsuccessful in clinical trials.|$|E

Seven patients received AG 1, 000 mg daily plus Hydrocortisone (HC) cover and six received RG as dose escalation of 200 mg bd, 400 mg bd and 800 mg bd. In vivo aromatase inhibition was investigated using the double bolus injection technique with [4 - 14 C] oestrone ([4 - 14 C]E 1) and [6, 7 - 3 H] androstenedione ([6, 7 - 3 H] 4 A) followed by a 96 h urine collection.
