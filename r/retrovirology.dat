2500|$|The {{earliest}} serum {{housed in}} the DoDSR was collected through the Armed Forces’ HLTV-III screening program, implemented in 1985 {{in response to the}} emergence of a new human virus, subsequently known as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Early laboratory testing was performed via contracted private laboratories. Screening soon expanded to all civilian applicants processed at Military Entrance Processing Stations. A condition of some early laboratory testing contracts specified that remnant serum were to remain in frozen storage. In 1989, the Army’s Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) awarded a contract to McKesson to consolidate and store accumulated residual serum specimens at a single facility, established in proximity to WRAIR in Rockville, Maryland. The HIV Research Program (established by Congressional Direction in 1986), under the WRAIR Division of <b>Retrovirology,</b> established the Walter Reed Army Serum Repository, which would evolve to become the Army/Navy Serum Repository in 1989. In 2001, the repository inventory was moved to its current location, a [...] facility in Silver Spring, Maryland. In recent years, the DoDSR has grown by approximately 1.9-2.3 million specimens annually. By 2007, the DoDSR inventory had grown to over 44 million specimens, and by the end of 2009, over 50,000,000 specimens.|$|E

50|$|A monthly intravaginal ring {{containing}} dapivirine {{has been}} developed {{as a form of}} HIV prevention for women. Two Phase 3 clinical trials of intravaginal dapivirine rings for HIV prevention were completed in 2015 and results were announced at the 2016 Conference on <b>Retrovirology</b> and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). The ASPIRE Study (MTN-020) reported a 27% reduction in HIV-1 acquisition (95% CI 12-57%, p=0.007), with a trend toward greater protection in women over age 21 and no significant protection for women under age 21. The Ring Study (IPM-027) reported a 31% reduction in HIV acquisition (95% CI 0.9-51.5%, p=0.040) also with a trend toward greater efficacy in women over age 21. In both trials, more than 80% of returned rings showed signs of drug depletion indicating at least some use, and more than 80% of blood samples from participants in the active arm had levels of dapivirine consistent at least 8 hours of continuous use preceding the blood test. Neither trial could evaluate whether the product was used consistently between study visits.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{researchers}} {{were concerned about}} contamination from the first reports of XMRV-disease associations, and these concerns spread as study after study failed to replicate WPI's results. In December, 2010, four independent articles {{published in the journal}} <b>Retrovirology</b> presented evidence that reported XMRV detection could be explained by contamination of laboratory reagents, tissue samples and blood. Samples that were positive for XMRV were also positive for mouse DNA contaminants. Furthermore, the striking identity of XMRV genomic sequences and their similarity to xenotropic MLVs in several human cell lines suggested that XMRV is not a transmissible human pathogen. The British Medical Journal responded with an article entitled, [...] "Chronic fatigue syndrome is not caused by XMRV virus, study shows". A fifth study supporting the contamination hypothesis was published in February, 2011, just ahead of the 18th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). At CROI, WPI representatives were absent, and a large amount of negative data was presented. Two groups showed evidence that XMRV is a recombinant of two mouse retroviruses, which infected a prostate cancer cell line during passage through nude mice. Virologist John Coffin, who had previously expressed optimism about the initial WPI data, declared, [...] "It's all contamination." [...] Robert Silverman, who was a co-author of the original XMRV-CFS article but is no longer collaborating with Mikovits, told the Chicago Tribune that he was [...] "concerned about lab contamination, despite our best efforts to avoid it".|$|E
