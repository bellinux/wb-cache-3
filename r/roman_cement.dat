It was {{designated}} in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme, comprising existing roads and streets, mostly historic, and later using stretches of purpose-built new roads in what is now the outer London borough of Barnet. The Archway Road section was built by Thomas Telford using <b>Roman</b> <b>cement</b> and gravel, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building. The route closely follows the historic route of the Great North Road, though from 1954 it has diverted round the congested suburbs of Finchley and High Barnet along modern roads constructed in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The A1 route was {{designated}} in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme. Through the inner boroughs of the City, Islington, and Haringey it uses existing roads and streets; {{when it reaches}} {{what is now the}} outer London borough of Barnet, some stretches of purpose-built new roads were built, and others have been widened and made into dual carriageways. In 1828, John Benjamin Macneill, chief engineer to Thomas Telford, used <b>Roman</b> <b>cement</b> and gravel to solve problems with wear and tear on the Archway Road section of what is now the A1, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building.|$|E

5000|$|But for the {{building}} of their [...] "ouvrages d’art", especially works related to water storage (cisterns, aqueducts), the Roman architects {{did not hesitate to}} use more sophisticated and expensive ingredients. These outstanding <b>Roman</b> <b>cements</b> are based on the calcic activation of ceramic aggregates (in Latin testa, analogue to our modern metakaolin MK-750) and alkali rich volcanic tuffs (cretoni, zeolitic pozzolan), respectively with lime. MAS-NMR Spectroscopy investigations were carried out on these high-tech <b>Roman</b> <b>cements</b> dating to the 2nd century AD. They show their geopolymeric make-up.|$|R
5000|$|An Austrian {{standard}} from 1880, {{providing a}} contemporary definition of <b>Roman</b> <b>cements,</b> reads: [...] "Roman cements are products obtained from argillaceous marlstones by burning below the sintering temperature. They do not slake {{in contact with}} water and must therefore be ground to a floury fineness." ...|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} recent {{resurgence}} {{of interest in}} Natural <b>cements</b> and <b>Roman</b> <b>cements</b> due mainly {{to the need for}} repair of façades done in this material in the 19th century. The major confusion involved for many people in this subject is the terminology used.Roman cement was originally the name given, by Parker, to the cement he patented which is a Natural cement (i.e. it is a marl (or limestone containing integral clay) dug out of the ground, burnt and ground to a fine powder).|$|R
25|$|At Lichfield Cathedral, the 18th {{century had}} been a period of decay: the 15th-century library was pulled down, most of the statues on the west front were removed, and the {{stonework}} covered with <b>Roman</b> <b>cement.</b> After some structural work early in the 19th century by James Wyatt, the ornate west front (pictured above) was restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott. It includes many ornate carved figures of kings, queens and saints, created from original materials where possible and new imitations and additions when the originals were not available. Wyatt's choir-screen had utilised medieval stone-work which Scott in turn used to create the clergy's seats in the sanctuary. A new metal screen by Francis Skidmore and John Birnie Philip to designs by Scott was installed, as was a Minton tile pavement stretching from choir screen to altar, inspired by medieval tiles found in the Choir foundations.|$|E
25|$|Many {{difficulties}} {{occurred in}} driving the piles which considerably retarded {{the progress of}} the work, and, among others, the peculiar effect of ebb and flow during this operation is worthy of note. At flood-tide the sand became so hard as almost totally to resist the utmost efforts of driving, while at ebb the sand was quite loose, and allowed of doing so with facility. It was therefore found necessary to abandon the driving on many occasions during high water. The difference between high and low water is 11 feet 6 inches. Another difficulty arose from the quicksands beneath the foundations. Although the piles were driven to the rock bottom, the water forced its way up, baffling the attempts to fill in between them; this, however, was remedied by using a concrete made of broken stone and <b>Roman</b> <b>cement,</b> which was continually thrown in until the bottom was found to be secure.|$|E
500|$|After the Archway roundabout, the A1 {{enters a}} cutting, and becomes Archway Road. The {{original}} road north {{went up the}} very steep Highgate Hill (now the B519) {{to the village of}} Highgate. By 1808 this was proving unsuitable for increasingly heavy traffic, and a road, crossing the hill through a tunnel at a shallower gradient, was proposed by a mining engineer, Robert Vazie; a turnpike trust – the Highgate Archway Company – was set up and work started in 1810. The brick built tunnel collapsed during construction on 13 April 1812, and John Nash constructed a brick bridge, using a series of arches like a canal viaduct, to carry Hornsey Lane over what was now a cutting. Nash's Archway Bridge, a little way south of the current bridge, and the new Archway Road were opened in 1813, though the road surface, being constructed of sand and gravel, proved difficult for heavy traffic. Parliamentary Commissioners took over the road, and John Benjamin Macneill, chief engineer to Thomas Telford, proposed using <b>Roman</b> <b>cement</b> and gravel, an innovative technique that was used {{for the first time on}} Archway Road, and is the basis for modern road building. The construction was financed by tolls which were abolished in 1876 – traffic increased substantially thereafter, particularly after the introduction of trams on the road. Between 1897 and 1900, Nash's bridge was replaced with the present cast-iron Hornsey Lane Bridge, designed by Sir Alexander Binnie, accessible from the Archway Road level by a steep flight of steps. [...] Hornsey Lane Bridge, designated a Grade II listed building by English Heritage in 1972, is informally called [...] "Suicide Bridge" [...] as it is a known suicide spot. It was the venue for the mental illness campaign group Mad Pride's inaugural vigil in 2000, and was the subject of Johnny Burke's 2006 film The Bridge. When, at the end of 2010, three men in three weeks committed suicide by jumping from the bridge, a campaign was set up by local residents for better anti-suicide measures to be put in place. Hornsey Lane and the bridge marks the boundary between the Inner London Borough of Islington and the Outer London Borough of Haringey.|$|E
5000|$|Natural {{pozzolanic}} reactions {{can cause}} mortars and concretes containing these materials to [...] "self-heal". The EMC Activation process can at times {{increase the likelihood}} of the occurrence of these pozzolanic reactions. The same tendency been noted and studied in the various supporting structures of Hagia Sophia built for the Byzantine emperor Justinian (now, Istanbul, Turkey). [...] There, in common with most <b>Roman</b> <b>cements,</b> mortars comprising high amounts of pozzolana were used — in order to give what was thought to be an increased resistance to the stress-effects caused by earthquakes.|$|R

5000|$|The {{setting of}} {{pozzolanic}} cements has {{much in common}} with setting of their modern counterpart, Portland cement. The high silica composition of <b>Roman</b> pozzolana <b>cements</b> is very close to that of modern cement to which blast furnace slag, fly ash, or silica fume have been added.|$|R
2500|$|The {{development}} of modern Portland cement (sometimes called ordinary or normal Portland cement) began in 1756, when John Smeaton experimented with combinations of different limestones and additives, including trass and pozzolanas, {{relating to the}} planned construction of a lighthouse, now known as Smeaton's Tower. In the late 18th century, <b>Roman</b> <b>cement</b> was developed and patented in 1796 by James Parker; <b>Roman</b> <b>cement</b> quickly became popular, but was largely replaced by Portland cement in the 1850s. [...] In 1811, James Frost produced a cement he called British cement. [...] James Frost {{is reported to have}} erected a manufactory for making of an artificial cement in 1826. [...] In 1843, Aspdin's son William improved their cement, which was initially called 'Patent Portland cement', although he had no patent. In 1818, French engineer Louis Vicat invented an artificial hydraulic lime considered the 'principal forerunner' of Portland cement and, '...Edgar Dobbs of Southwark patented a cement of this kind in 1811'. [...] Portland cement was used by Joseph Aspdin in his cement patent in 1824 because of the cement's resemblance to Portland stone. The name 'Portland cement' is also recorded in a directory published in 1823 being associated with a William Lockwood, a Dave Stewart, and possibly others. [...] However, Aspdin's cement was nothing like modern Portland cement, but was a first step in the {{development of}} modern Portland cement, called a 'proto-Portland cement'.|$|E
2500|$|The {{company was}} {{successful}} at first, although stressed by underfunding {{and the cost}} of the pier, and by 1866 an enquiry commission stated: [...] "The Company have already cleared about five square miles, and culched about one square mile of their grounds, and have laid down on parts of their beds many millions of oysters". However, as the company was still relatively new, they had not yet developed their oysters to quite the same market value as the long-established Whitstable ones. A sideline for the Hampton fishermen was cement stones, because they were found on the Hampton fishing grounds. These were boulders the size of a man's head, sold to manufacturers of <b>Roman</b> <b>cement.</b> There was a dispute with the rival Whitstable Oyster Company, and Whitstable was fined £1 per oyster taken from Hampton's grounds, while Hampton was accused of not fully exploiting its breeding ponds and of importing foreign oysters for resale. In 1869, local inshore fishermen complained that their traditional territory was now defended on the company's behalf by HMS Buzzard and that the company employed outsiders for long hours and low pay. In the 1870s the oyster trade went into decline and suffered over-fishing, and in 1876 the Government set up a select committee to enquire into scarcity and price. The result was the 1877 Act which prevented sale of dredged oysters in June to August, and freshwater pond oysters between May and August. In the following three severe winters, oysters died in the shallow Estuary waters and the company went into liquidation. The business passed into the hands of hotel owner Major Davis who closed it down when his operation went to Faversham. Company assets were sold on 20 July 1881 and it officially wound up in 1884.|$|E

5000|$|In the <b>Roman</b> Empire, <b>cements</b> {{made from}} {{pozzolanic}} ash/pozzolana and an aggregate made from pumice {{were used to}} make a concrete very similar to modern Portland cement concrete.

The Romans found out that insulated glazing (or [...] "double glazing") improved greatly on keeping buildings warm, and this technique was used in the construction of public baths.|$|R
40|$|NoHydration of five Roman and American natural cements was {{analyzed}} using X-ray diffraction, mercury intrusion porosimetry, and {{scanning electron microscopy}} of cement pastes. Two cements were prepared in the laboratory by burning marls from geological sources in Poland (Folwark) and Austria (Lilienfeld).

Three other cements are produced commercially: quick setting Prompt cement from Vicat, France, and Rosendale cements from Edison Coatings Inc., USA. The hydration of the cements studied was shown to comprise two distinct stages. The immediate setting and early strength is due to the formation of calcium aluminum oxide carbonate (or sulfate) hydroxide hydrates. The development of long-term strength is brought about by the formation of calcium silicate hydrates. Similarities and differences between the individual cements are discussed...|$|R

The stones were then moved along the bridge on the waggon to the building within reach of the balance-crane, with which they were laid in their respective places on the building. The masons immediately thereafter proceeded to bore the trenail-holes into the course below, and otherwise to complete the one in hand. When the first stone was to be suspended by the balance-crane, the bell on the beacon was rung, and all the artificers and seamen were collected on the building. Three hearty cheers were given while it was lowered into its place, and the steward served round a glass of rum, when success was drunk to the further progress of the building.|$|E

25|$|The {{greatest}} bridge {{builders of}} antiquity were the ancient Romans. The Romans built arch bridges and aqueducts that could stand in conditions that would damage or destroy earlier designs. Some stand today.

Recently, it has been found that it materially differs in several ways from modern concrete which is based on Portland <b>cement.</b> <b>Roman</b> concrete is durable due to its incorporation of volcanic ash, which prevents cracks from spreading. By the middle of the 1st century, the material was used frequently, often brick-faced, although variations in aggregate allowed different arrangements of materials. Further innovative developments in the material, called the Concrete Revolution, contributed to structurally complicated forms, such as the Pantheon dome, the world's largest and oldest unreinforced concrete dome.|$|R
