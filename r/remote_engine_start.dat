50|$|The Duster was {{introduced}} in Russia in 2012, as Renault Duster. Its off-road capabilities for the relatively modest price have made Duster very popular. Initial strong demand has caused preorder waiting times of up to 18 months. In {{the first half of}} 2013, Renault Duster sold 40710 units, making it the 4th best-selling car model in Russia overall. The Duster is adapted to the Russian consumers expectations with for example the Renault Start innovative system of <b>remote</b> <b>engine</b> <b>start,</b> useful during the cold days to heat the car's body and engine, which decreases polluting emissions. In June 2015, a renewed version of the Duster was launched in Russia with a new range of more powerful and low-consumption engines, an automatic gearbox, some new options, new interior ergonomics and materials of interior trim, and a new exterior design.|$|E

5000|$|For the US market, {{the second}} {{generation}} Honda Ridgeline was initially offered in seven different trim levels: RT, RTS, Sport, RTL, RTL-T, RTL-E, and Black Edition until the 2018 model year when Honda removed the RTS trim from the lineup. [...] In addition to the standard equipment found in the RT trim, {{it could also be}} ordered in FWD or AWD until the 2018 model year which removed the AWD option. The 2017 RTS trim added <b>remote</b> <b>engine</b> <b>start,</b> smart entry, tri-zone automatic climate control, and fog lights as well as an AWD option. The Sport trim takes the 2017 RTS and adds gray painted alloy rims, black painted exterior trim, and sport badging. The RTL trim takes a different approach with the 2017 RTS by adding a leather-trimmed interior, heated front seats, ten-way power driver's seat, and an acoustic windshield. The RTL-T trim takes the RTL and adds the 8 in infotainment touchscreen system, LaneWatch, additional front and rear Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.0 outlets, automatic dimming rearview mirror, and a few other features. RTL-E trim takes the RTL-T and replaces LaneWatch with blind spot monitoring and adds Honda Sensing, a 540W audio system with truck bed audio, the bed-mounted 115V/150W-to-400W AC inverter, high-intensity discharge (HID) headlights, heated steering wheel, conversation mirror, additional interior and exterior illumination, and a few other features as well as making AWD standard. The top trim, known as the Black Edition, adds a unique blackout treatment to the RTL-E trim.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an analytical study of the dynamics and control of turbofan lift engines, and proposes methods of meeting the response requirements imposed by the VTOL aircraft application. Two types of lift fan engines are discussed: the integral and <b>remote.</b> The integral <b>engine</b> is a conventional two-spool, high bypass ratio turbofan designed for low noise and short length. The <b>remote</b> <b>engine</b> employs a gas generator and a lift fan which are separated by a duct, and which need not be coaxial. For the integral engine, a control system design is presented which satisfies the VTOL response requirements. For the <b>remote</b> <b>engine,</b> two unconventional methods of control involving flow transfer between lift units are discussed...|$|R
