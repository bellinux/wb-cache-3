5|$|Despite {{their strong}} first half {{up to that}} point, Bolton went a goal behind in the 37th minute. Liverpool midfielder Steve McManaman {{received}} the ball from John Barnes, he <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> Bolton defender Alan Stubbs, then past Scott Green. His subsequent shot was not powerful, but Bolton goalkeeper Keith Branagan could not stop the ball from going into the goal, giving Liverpool a 1–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Liverpool {{had a chance to}} score. Callaghan took a throw-in, which he threw to Lawler, his cross into the Leeds penalty area was met by Hunt, but his header went wide of the goal. Liverpool {{continued}} to pressure and only an interception from Bremner, before Stevenson could reach the ball, prevented a Liverpool goal. Leeds had a free-kick a few minutes later, but Giles' effort was saved by Lawrence. A few minutes later, St. John found Peter Thompson, who <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> Bremner and shot, but it was diverted wide by Sprake. The ball found dropped to hunt, but his cross was gathered by the Leeds goalkeeper.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool pressed and Thompson forced Sprake into {{a number}} of saves. Leeds had another chance as Bremner had a shot saved by Lawrence after {{receiving}} the ball from Reaney. A few minutes later, Strong forced Sprake into a save, which resulted in a corner. St. John came close to scoring from the subsequent corner, but his shot went over the Leeds goal. However, with three minutes of extra time remaining, St. John scored. Smith found Callaghan, who <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> two Leeds defenders, his cross into the Leeds penalty area was headed into the goal by St. John to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead.|$|E

5|$|Messi's first goal, {{in which}} he <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> a number of opponents, was the runner-up in the FIFA Puskás Award for the year's best goal. Neymar was criticised for his showboating in the final minutes of the match, with Barcelona manager Luis Enrique excusing his Brazilian striker for {{cultural}} reasons. Both teams and the Royal Spanish Football Federation were given fines by the nation's government for security breaches and allowing separatist demonstrations at the match. As Barcelona won the 2014–15 La Liga, Athletic qualified automatically as the cup representative in the 2015 Supercopa de España.|$|E
5|$|When built, the {{surrounding}} area was composed of dirt roads and private residences. The Southern Pacific Railroad's 1868 west side rail line ran down Fourth Avenue past City Hall and the county courthouse. The city and county governments fought the railroad to remove the dirty and noisy steam locomotives from this route, succeeding in 1912. Southern Pacific's electric interurban line continued on the tracks until the 1930s. In 2007, work began on adding light rail tracks on Fifth Avenue for the planned MAX Green Line, and trains once again <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> City Hall starting in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Ajax {{opened the}} scoring {{in the third}} minute when Cees de Wolf, who was making his debut for Ajax, scored. A throw-in by Cruyff was headed into the air, Liverpool goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence came to collect the ball. Realising he could not reach it, he moved back towards his goal, but de Wolf outjumped defender Chris Lawler to head {{the ball into the}} Liverpool goal. The {{conditions}} were so poor, that the crowd celebrated in stages. Those closest to the goal celebrated immediately, while those {{at the other end of}} the stadium reacted to these celebrations. Liverpool striker Hunt had a chance to score in the 12th minute, but his shot was saved by Ajax goalkeeper Gert Bals. Following the goal Ajax continued to attack, midfielder Sjaak Swart <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> three Liverpool players before passing the ball to Klaas Nuninga, whose shot was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Lawrence. However, Lawrence dropped the ball near Johan Cruyff, who scored to give Ajax a 2–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|First class mourners {{entered through}} the {{driveway}} under {{the office building}} which turned sharply left to run beneath a glass canopy parallel to Westminster Bridge Road; this stretch was faced with glazed white brick and lined with palm and bay trees. The driveway <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> mortuaries and storerooms to the lifts and stairs to the platforms, and also to a secondary entrance on Newnham Terrace (off Hercules Road). Above the mortuaries and storerooms were the LNC's workshops. Lifts and an elaborate wrought-iron staircase led from the lower two floors to platform level on the second floor. This upper level housed a sumptuous oak-panelled Chapelle Ardente, intended for mourners unable to make the journey to Brookwood {{to pay their respects}} to the deceased. A short and wide pathway led to the first class platform, lined with waiting rooms and a ticket office; the first class platform was equipped with five separate waiting rooms to keep mourners from different funeral parties separate.|$|E
5|$|When Grace (Debra Messing) and {{her boyfriend}} Leo (Harry Connick Jr.) take a walk around Central Park, they notice a tent and a van parked nearby, after a bride and groom <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> them. Eager {{to know what is}} happening, Grace stops by the van, sees Katie Couric, and asks her what is going on. Katie tells Grace that The Today Show is having massive {{televised}} weddings in the park for ratings sweeps week. When Katie asks Grace and Leo if they would like to get married, Leo says yes, but Grace believes he is being sarcastic, only later realizing that he is serious. Leo explains to Grace that because they originally met in a park, they should also get married in a park. Leo proposes and Grace accepts, despite that the two have only known each other for two months.|$|E
25|$|With {{the opening}} of Princess Margaret Hospital on 31 August 1959 the route was altered to make the {{hospital}} a stop during visiting hours. The service's increasing popularity with visitors to the hospital ensured that by August 1965 all buses <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> the hospital.|$|E

25|$|Ryan and Walker <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> the {{critically}} wounded Hodson and commandeered a blue Standard Vanguard sedan on Sydney Road from its driver, Brian Mullins. With Walker driving and Ryan a passenger, the car travelled through an adjacent service station and then west along O'Hea Street.|$|E
25|$|His first {{action in}} a Patriots uniform came against the New York Jets in Week 1. He quickly quieted critics who claimed that his skills had {{deteriorated}} by hauling in 9 receptions for 181 yards, including a 51-yard touchdown pass in which he <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> 3 Jets defenders.|$|E

25|$|The Leeds to Wetherby Railway had {{a station}} at Scholes and passed under the turnpike to the northeast. The line {{was built by}} the North Eastern Railway and <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> the eastern border of Swarcliffe and Stanks. It opened on 1 May 1876 and closed in 1964. Services were {{withdrawn}} {{as part of the}} Beeching Axe; an informal name for the British Government's attempt to reduce the cost of running British Railways in the1960s.|$|E
25|$|In August 1918 the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) {{was working}} on {{building}} a level crossing at Smørstein {{as part of a}} realignment of a road. The earthwork from the construction was piled up close to the fjord. Its weight caused a landslide on 17 August, in which the masses slid into the fjord. This caused a series of successive smaller slides, each wave originating {{closer and closer to the}} railway tracks. All available maintenance of way crew were prescribed from the district. NSB originally operated trains past the section, but eventually chose to evacuate the trains while they <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> the site.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} Test of the 1988 Bledisloe Cup New Zealand scored three tries {{in the opening}} 12 minutes of the match. In the opening minutes of the game, Australian fullback Andrew Leeds failed to catch a high kick, the ball fell to All Black prop Steve McDowell, who <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> Campese to score a try. John Kirwan scored his first try of the Test in the eighth minute by running past Campese, after All Black flyhalf Grant Fox called a double cut-out pass. Kirwan scored a second time in the 12th minute after an overlap had been created for him.|$|E
25|$|From {{the line}} of the walls, there may have been another {{entrance}} on the west side, but this is uncertain. A bank of earth appears to have been erected some distance away {{to the north of the}} castle, either as a form of defence, or perhaps to obscure the castle from a former road that <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> it from that direction. The towers seem not to have had ground-floor entrances. Putlog holes suggest that they had upper floors. Putlog holes in the curtain walls suggest the presence of hoardings to protect defenders. This large, lime-washed, stone, moated castle would have been visually impressive.|$|E
25|$|The 17th-century {{road from}} Glasgow to Irvine <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> 'The Hill' farm on the {{opposite}} side to the existing road, which is itself on the line of the 18th-century turnpike. The house used to 'face' the other direction as can be seen by a slight asymmetry in the existing frontage and the old 'front door' is now a just a window, but with 'tell tale' ornamentation on the lintel. Then presence of the road running passed the farm would have made the transport of her cheeses that much easier in those days of transport by pack animal or sledge. Timothy Pont's map of Cunninghame (1604–1608) marks an 'O Hill', emphasising the age of this settlement.|$|E
