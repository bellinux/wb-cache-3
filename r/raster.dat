5|$|Robotron: 2084 {{features}} monaural {{sound and}} <b>raster</b> graphics on a 19-inch CRT monitor. It uses a Motorola 6809 {{central processing unit}} that operates at 1MHz. To produce multiple sounds on a single audio channel, the game uses a priority scheme to generate sounds in order of importance. A custom graphics coprocessor—which operates as a blitter chip—generates the on-screen objects and visual effects. The coprocessor increases the transfer speed of memory, which allows the game to simultaneously animate {{a large number of}} objects.|$|E
5|$|The game uses LaserDisc {{technology}} to stream pre-recorded animation, which {{was produced by}} Japanese studio Toei Animation. The game features <b>raster</b> graphics on a CRT monitor and amplified monaural sound. The protagonist's appearance was possibly derived from the main character, Lum, from the Japanese manga and anime series Urusei Yatsura. Several factors prevented an overseas release: {{a decline in the}} popularity of laserdisc arcade games in the mid-80s, the expensive price of laserdisc technology, and difficulty to translate. In the original Japanese Reika is voiced by Yuriko Yamamoto.|$|E
5|$|Joust was {{developed}} by Williams Electronics, with John Newcomer as the lead designer. Programmer Bill Pfutzenrueter and artists Jan Hendricks and Python Anghelo assisted him. Tim Murphy and John Kotlarik handled the audio design. The game features amplified monaural sound and <b>raster</b> graphics on a 19-inch color CRT monitor. Like other Williams arcade games, Joust was programmed in assembly language. A pack of three AA batteries provide power to save the game's settings and high scores when the machine is unplugged from an electrical outlet. The cabinet artwork, by Anghelo, is stenciled on a wooden frame. Anghelo also designed artwork for promotional materials; one such flyer featured archaic English, which was also incorporated into the game's onscreen instructions and game-over message.|$|E

30|$|In {{the fields}} of remote sensing, GIS, and {{landscape}} ecology, scientists often process remotely sensed data as 2 D <b>rasters</b> (images). Comparing to 2 D <b>rasters,</b> 3 D <b>rasters</b> are less common, despite the fact they explicitly preserve the 3 D relations in the data such as lidar point clouds.|$|R
30|$|The {{processing}} {{times and}} disk space will be typically higher for 3 D <b>rasters</b> simply {{because there is}} one more dimension to take care of in comparison to 2 D <b>rasters,</b> however the parallelization of the computations can be as straightforward as in 2 D. In general, 3 D <b>rasters</b> can be used for development of new remotely sensed data processing techniques and subsequent landscape ecology methodologies and measures such as landscape indices or connectivity metrics. Specifically 3 D <b>rasters</b> in GRASS GIS were used in past for modeling of evaporation processes in 3 D [46].|$|R
5|$|Slalom was {{originally}} released in 1986 in the arcades {{as part of}} the Nintendo VS. System and was titled Vs. Slalom. This release featured an upright cabinet, a joystick, one jump button, monaural sound, and standard <b>raster</b> graphics. There was also an optional controller upgrade that featured two physical ski poles and shortened skis that the player could stand on and use to control the skier onscreen. The NES version was released by Nintendo in North America in March1987 and in Europe on October15, 1987. Slalom was Rare's first video game developed as a new company. It was also the Stamper brothers' first video game console release.|$|E
5|$|Because {{microcomputers}} in Japan {{were not}} powerful enough {{at the time}} to perform the complex tasks involved in designing and programming Space Invaders, Nishikado had to design his own custom hardware and development tools for the game. He created the arcade board using new microprocessors from the United States. The game uses an Intel 8080 central processing unit, features <b>raster</b> graphics on a CRT monitor and monaural sound hosted by a combination of analog circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. Despite the specially developed hardware, Nishikado was unable to program the game as he wanted—the Control Program board was not powerful enough to display the graphics in color or move the enemies faster—and he considered the development of the hardware {{the most difficult part of}} the whole process. While programming the game, Nishikado discovered that the processor was able to render the alien graphics faster the fewer were on screen. Rather than design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he decided to keep it as a challenging gameplay mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal <b>raster</b> pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E
40|$|The visual {{inspection}} {{process in the}} casting industry is a subjective task. Inspectors are often required to make absolute judgments when deciding to classify a casting as acceptable or in need of re-work. Due to this subjectivity, castings can be incorrectly classified as acceptable or scheduled for unnecessary re-work, leading to longer production times or higher costs. It is of interest for both manufacturers and customers of the casting industry to improve the {{visual inspection}} process. This research was performed {{with the goal of}} using an inspection strategy based on <b>rastering</b> to improve the success of a visual inspection task. Paper and video training methods were used to present a <b>rastering</b> strategy to each participant. The results indicate that video assisted <b>rastering</b> training produced superior results when compared to basic <b>rastering</b> training...|$|R

5|$|Qwak! was {{released}} in a standard upright arcade cabinet with {{a black and white}} <b>raster</b> television monitor inset, with the rifle holster and start button below as the only controls. The reeds and tree branch overlay is screen printed in color onto a clear panel in front of the monitor, and is backlit by the screen; the screen is lit with a gray background instead of a black one in order to produce this effect. When the gun is triggered, the duck additionally flashes white briefly, so as to be detected by the light gun; the relative brightness of the screen makes this effect less obvious than with other similar light gun games. Qwak! was not the first light gun video game; it was preceded by the arcade game Balloon Gun (August 1974) and a light gun game for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console (1972), as well as non-video game light gun games since the 1936 Seeberg Ray-O-Lite.|$|E
5|$|The arcade game {{features}} <b>raster</b> graphics on a CRT monitor displaying 4096 {{colors and}} amplified stereophonic sound. The visuals are reflected into view via a {{mirror in the}} cabinet. The arcade cabinet is upright, with the marquee bearing the game's name protruding outward. There are large, blue plastic molds around the cabinet designed to resemble an alien cocoon. The music for Space Gun was composed by Norihiro Furukawa and Naoto Yagishita of Zuntata, Taito's music division. A soundtrack CD (a split release with the soundtrack for Taito game Liquid Kids) was released by Pony Canyon and Scitron on January 21, 1991. This album was also released as part of Taito 1500 Collector's Box on September 17, 1993. A track from the game is on the limited edition CD Zuntata History L'ab-normal 1st, released by Zuntata/Taito on April 1, 1999.|$|E

25|$|<b>Raster</b> hydrographs are pixel-based plots for {{visualizing}} {{and identifying}} variations {{and changes in}} large multidimensional data sets. Originally developed by Keim (2000) they were first applied in hydrology by Koehler (2004) {{as a means of}} highlighting inter-annual and intra-annual changes in streamflow. The <b>raster</b> hydrographs in WaterWatch, like those developed by Koehler, depict years on the y-axis and days along the x-axis. Users can choose to plot streamflow (actual values or log values), streamflow percentile, or streamflow class (from 1, for low flow, to 7 for high flow), for Daily, 7-Day, 14-Day, and 28-Day streamflow.

40|$|An {{isotope ratio}} imaging {{technique}} using the HokuDai isotope microscope {{system has been}} applied to in-situ survey for presolar grains in the type- 3 enstatite chondrite ALHA 81189. <b>Rastered</b> and static ion beam were used for primary beam. Lateral resolution of the isotope image was achieved to be 0. 4 μm for static ion beam mode and to be 0. 6 μm for <b>rastered</b> ion beam mode. As a result, the abundances of presolar grains are 150 to 200 % larger under the static ion beam mode than under the <b>rastered</b> ion beam mode. Development of image processing introducing isotopography of 32 S-, 24 Mg 16 O- and 56 Fe- succeeded to increase efficiency of presolar grain characterization. Using the static ion beam and introducing appropriate isotopography were very useful methods of in-situ characterization of presolar grains in meteorites...|$|R
25|$|Vector {{graphics}} formats are complementary to <b>raster</b> graphics. <b>Raster</b> graphics is {{the representation}} of images as an array of pixels and is typically used for {{the representation of}} photographic images.

40|$|Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} commercial tree species in northeastern Minnesota. The Lake County Forestry department is interested in assessing the quality of aspen stands on tax forfeit land. Knowing the quality of aspen is important for forest management decisions. Using handheld computers, data from 2, 231 plots was collected in stands labeled as aspen in the forest inventory. Five categories of data from this inventory were interpolated into <b>rasters</b> using ArcGIS 9. x Spatial Analyst Extension. Inverse Distance Weight (IDW), Spline, and Natural Neighbor with multiple combinations of parameters were all used to derive interpolations. Each of these interpolated <b>rasters</b> was statistically compared with each other to find the most appropriate method of interpolation. The IDW method using a power of 3 and a 140 m fixed radius was the most accurate. The interpolated <b>rasters</b> for each data category were then reclassed based on an index scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most desirable trait for aspen. The reclassed <b>rasters</b> were then added together to find the overall quality index. Based on the results from this study, aspen quality increases with distance from Lake Superior. No values greater than 23 out of 25 and no values less than 5 were generated. GIS can successfully be used to analyze quaking aspen quality.

40|$|While {{numerous}} studies find that deep-saline sandstone aquifers in the United States could store many decades {{worth of the}} nation's current annual CO 2 emissions, the likely cost of this storage (i. e. the cost of storage only and not capture and transport costs) has been harder to constrain. We use publicly available data of key reservoir properties to produce geo-referenced <b>rasters</b> of estimated storage capacity and cost for regions within 15 deep-saline sandstone aquifers in the United States. The <b>rasters</b> reveal the reservoir quality of these aquifers to be so variable that the cost estimates for storage span three orders of magnitude and average>$ 100 /tonne CO 2. However, when the cost and corresponding capacity estimates in the <b>rasters</b> are assembled into a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC), we find that ~ 75 % of the estimated storage capacity could be available for<$ 2 /tonne. Furthermore, ~ 80 % of the total estimated storage capacity in the <b>rasters</b> is concentrated within just two of the aquifers-the Frio Formation along the Texas Gulf Coast, and the Mt. Simon Formation in the Michigan Basin, which together make up only ~ 20 % of the areas analyzed. While our assessment is not comprehensive, the results suggest {{there should be an}} abundance of low-cost storage for CO 2 in deep-saline aquifers, but a majority of this storage is likely to be concentrated within specific regions of a smaller number of these aquifers. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Nowadays, modern {{electron}} microscopes deliver images at atomic scale. The precise {{atomic structure}} encodes information about material properties. Thus, an important {{ingredient in the}} image analysis is to locate the centers of the atoms shown in micrographs as precisely as possible. Here, we consider {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM), which acquires data in a <b>rastering</b> pattern, pixel by pixel. Due to this <b>rastering</b> combined with the magnification to atomic scale, movements of the specimen even at the nanometer scale lead to random image distortions that make precise atom localization difficult. Given a series of STEM images, we derive a Bayesian method that jointly estimates the distortion in each image and reconstructs the underlying atomic grid of the material by fitting the atom bumps with suitable bump functions. The resulting highly non-convex minimization problems are solved numerically with a trust region approach. Well-posedness of the reconstruction method and the model behavior for faster and faster <b>rastering</b> are investigated using variational techniques. The performance of the method is finally evaluated on both synthetic and real experimental data...|$|R

The STEMs use of SEM-like beam <b>rastering</b> simplifies annular dark-field imaging, and other analytical techniques, but also means that image data is acquired in serial rather than in parallel fashion. Often TEM can be equipped with the scanning option and then it can function both as TEM and STEM.|$|R
