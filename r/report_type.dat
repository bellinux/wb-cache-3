50|$|The revelation {{principle}} {{is a fundamental}} principle in mechanism design. It states that if a social choice function can be implemented by an arbitrary mechanism (i.e. if that mechanism has an equilibrium outcome that corresponds to {{the outcome of the}} social choice function), then the same function can be implemented by an incentive-compatible-direct-mechanism (i.e. in which players truthfully <b>report</b> <b>type)</b> with the same equilibrium outcome (payoffs).|$|E
5000|$|It is {{difficult}} to solve for Bayesian equilibria in such a setting because it involves solving for agents best-response strategies and for the best inference from a possible strategic lie.

Our paper investigated the relationship between audit <b>report</b> <b>type</b> and business termination for various types of business terminations including bankruptcy, voluntary liquidation and merger. The results reveal significant differences across the forementioned types of business terminations. One difference is that the self-fulfilling prophecy only holds when the audited firm has no decision power as to termination of is operations, that is for bankruptcy. It does not hold for voluntary liquidation nor merger. Another important difference relates to business termination through merger. No significant difference in performance exists between surviving and merging firms and no endogenous relationship exists between mergers and audit <b>report</b> <b>type.</b> For merging firms audit report qualifications are triggered by the weakness of the auditee's internal control system and not by substandard financial performance. Finally, our {{study provides}} some evidence on quality differentiation between Big Six and non Big Six auditors in the Belgian audit market. When financial difficulties are obvious, as is the case when a company is about to go bankrupt, both Big Six and non big Six auditors are as competent and/or independent to assess and report going concern problems. However, when financial difficulties are less apparent, as is the case for firms which are about to go into liquidation, our results indicate that Big Six auditors are more likely to issue a qualified audit opinion.

40|$|Background: International {{financial}} reporting standards have constantly been facing fast-growing significant development. This has mainly {{been driven by}} the aim of better serving {{the needs of the}} investors. Awareness that corporate {{financial reporting}} provides short-sighted information and measures has been rising among politicians, in the society and on the financial markets. Therefore, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting as a form of non-financial reporting has made it to limelight. Various <b>reporting</b> <b>types</b> developed, but the <b>type</b> of <b>reporting</b> is hardly codified. Objective: The goal {{of this paper is to}} identify the superior CSR <b>reporting</b> <b>type</b> from a stakeholder 2 ̆ 7 s perspective. After identifying and analyzing central guidelines on CSR reporting and presenting different approaches, the authors will apply a positive-empirical methodology.

Results: This study demonstrates the validity of the used methodology for the analysis of search and information browsing behavior in various <b>types</b> of sustainability <b>reports.</b> Conclusions: Overall our findings indicate that the <b>reporting</b> <b>type</b> "reference sustainability report" may not be advisable from a stakeholder’s perspective...|$|R
