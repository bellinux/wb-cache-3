I was interested in what I could learn from them concerning the timing and location of spawning aggregations of reef fishes, especially coral trout. Over the previous decade I had interviewed reef fishermen in numerous tropical Pacific: Islands and found among them many who were valuable sources of information on this subject...|$|R

Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital deafness, patellar luxation, ataxia, myasthenia gravis, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.|$|E
5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> dangerous, {{which made her}} extremely difficult to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal left at the zoo. Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, David Taylor, felt {{that she would not}} recover, and decided to call in a marksman to euthanise her.|$|E
40|$|There’s {{no reason}} why {{everyone}} shouldn’t understand the basics of quantum mechanics and relativity. These two cornerstones of 20 th-century physics have become a basis for our deepest understanding of reality, {{as well as of}} great practical importance to familiar technologies from lasers to the global positioning system. And, despite their <b>reputations</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> somewhat abstruse and inaccessible, the basic points of each theory can be stated simply enough that an interested person with no technical background in physics should be able to understand them. At a time when science seems both more central than ever and more removed from our everyday world, it is certainly worth the effort to share what we’ve learned about the workings of nature with interested nonscientists...|$|R

It {{is capable of}} striking at considerable range and occasionally may deliver a series of bites in rapid succession. Its venom is primarily composed of potent neurotoxins that may cause fast onset of symptoms. Despite its <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> formidable and highly aggressive, like most snakes, it usually attempts to flee from humans unless threatened or cornered.

5|$|Leigh {{appeared}} with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in A Yank at Oxford (1938), {{which was the}} first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing with the threat of a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martin's Lane (1938), with Charles Laughton.|$|E

The club toured across the UK, Europe and Israel throughout the 1990s and went as far as two memorable parties on the slopes of Mount Fuji in Japan and New York's Liberty Science Center. By 2001 the partners Chris Deckker, Mark Allen, Phil Ross and Janice Duncan were worn out and all but gone their separate ways. The last Return to the Source party was at Brixton Academy in 2002.|$|R

40|$|We {{conduct a}} series of {{laboratory}} experiments to understand what role commitment and reputation play in bargaining. The experiments implement the Abreu and Gul (2000) bargaining model that demonstrates how introducing behavioral types, which are obstinate in their demands, creates incentives for all players to build <b>reputations</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> hard bargainers. The data are qualitatively consistent with the theory, as subjects mimic induced types. Furthermore, we find evidence {{for the presence of}} complementary types, whose initial demands acquiesce to induced behavioural demands. However, there are quantitative deviations from the theory: subjects make aggressive demands too often and participate in longer conflicts before reaching agreements. Overall, the results suggest that the Abreu and Gul (2000) model can be used to gain insights to bargaining behavior, particularly in environments where the process underlying obstinate play is well established.

5|$|Māori cloaks {{are made}} of fine flax fibre and {{patterned}} with black, red and white triangles, diamonds and other geometric shapes. Greenstone was fashioned into earrings and necklaces, with the most well-known design being the hei-tiki, a distorted human figure sitting cross-legged with its head tilted to the side. Europeans brought English fashion etiquette to New Zealand, and until the 1950s most people dressed up for social occasions. Standards have since relaxed and New Zealand fashion has received a <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> casual, practical and lacklustre. However, the local fashion industry has grown significantly since 2000, doubling exports and increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels, with some labels gaining international recognition.|$|E

This has also created a humorous myth-like nature among players and journalists as to whether Half-Life 3 actually exists or not.|$|R
