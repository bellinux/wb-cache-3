5000|$|In 1724 a {{critical}} nine-day battle was fought at El Gran Cerro del Fierro (Great Mountain of Iron), {{resulting in a}} major defeat for the Apache. Within a few years, the last Apache settlements along the upper Arkansas River had disappeared. New Mexico historian Sherry Robinson doubts that the nine-day battle actually occurred. [...] "The hatred was real but probably not the battle. The teller of this tale, decades after it allegedly occurred, was the Apache-hating Texas Governor Domingo Cabello y Robles. Lipan anthropologist Enrique Maestas dismisses the story as folklore or one of many battles between Apaches and Comanches. Anthropologist Morris Opler wrote that 'authenticated nine-day battles between tribes are not too common in American Indian annals. Yet this bit of <b>recorded</b> <b>hearsay</b> — far removed {{in time and space}} from the putative event— has been cited with all earnestness again and again.'" ...|$|R

Although there are several accounts, current, <b>recorded</b> and <b>hearsay</b> about the commencement of the Kollam era, however in erstwhile North Malabar / Kolathunadu, the Kollam era is reckoned from the next month, Kanya-rasi (Virgo) (25 September) instead.

"There are fragmentary <b>records</b> {{and local}} <b>hearsay</b> which affirm that certain {{students}} of the (then) A and M College climbed the Organ Needle and the Rabbit Ears Plateau, two {{of the very few}} Organ peaks with walk-up routes, between 1900 and 1910; little San Agustin was probably climbed at or before this time, too. Technical climbing began only in the late 1940's, with some ascents by a group of German rocket scientists brought here to work at the White Sands Proving Grounds directly after the fall of Germany. In 1955 a group of local mountaineering enthusiasts banded together into a climbing club, which was briefly called the [...] "Tularosa Climbing Club" [...] before it took its present name of [...] "The Southwestern Mountaineers". From then on technical climbing went on apace, until today there are at least several routes up every peak." ...|$|R

60|$|Raleigh's chief prose {{works are}} the Discoverie of Guiana, a work which would {{certainly}} have been interesting enough had he told simply what he saw, but which was filled with colonization schemes and visions of an El Dorado to fill the eyes and ears of the credulous; and the History of the World, written to occupy his prison hours. The history is a wholly untrustworthy account of events from creation to {{the downfall of the}} Macedonian Empire. It is interesting chiefly for its style, which is simple and dignified, and for the flashes of wit and poetry that break into the fantastic combination of miracles, traditions, <b>hearsay,</b> and state <b>records</b> which he called history. In the conclusion is the famous apostrophe to Death, which suggests what Raleigh might have done had he lived less strenuously and written more carefully.|$|R
40|$|To be {{admissible}} {{under the}} <b>hearsay</b> rule's business <b>records</b> exception {{set out in}} Federal Rule of Evidence 803 (6), the record in question must have been “kept in the ordinary course of a regularly conducted business activity. ” Many electronic records, however, remain in a company's files only because the company had a duty to preserve them once it reasonably anticipated litigation or a government subpoena. The company otherwise typically would have deleted those electronically stored data in the regular operation of its business to make room on its burdened servers. This Article argues that such presumptive deletion undermines the trustworthiness and reliability of a business record, and thus the rationale of Rule 803 (6). Courts should therefore focus on the unique elements of the creation and preservation of electronic evidence, and consider whether a company truly kept the record at issue {{in the course of}} business, or simply because a duty to preserve required it...|$|R
40|$|One night, in {{the hours}} just before daybreak, the {{computer}} servers at Acme Corporation 2 ̆ 7 s headquarters quietly hum {{in the silence of}} the office 2 ̆ 7 s darkened hallways. Suddenly, they waken to life and begin haphazardly sifting through their files. Several states away, a hacker sits in his room, searching through the mainframe via an internet connection. His attack is quick-lasting only a short five minutes-but the evidence of invasion is apparent to Acme 2 ̆ 7 s IT employees when they come in to work the next morning. Nearly a year later, federal prosecutors bring suit in the federal district court against the person they believe to be the hacker. During the trial, several witnesses testify about the attack and its resulting damage. The only piece missing is the hacker 2 ̆ 7 s identity. In order to prove this, the prosecution wishes to introduce the mainframe 2 ̆ 7 s records of the attack, which document both the source of the invasion and the signature of the computer that conducted the entire event. A cursory check by computer specialists matched these records with the accused hacker 2 ̆ 7 s personal computer. The prosecutors lay sufficient foundation to authenticate the records and then move to have them admitted into evidence. 2 ̆ 2 Objection! 2 ̆ 2 states the defense counsel. 2 ̆ 2 On what grounds? 2 ̆ 2 replies the judge. 2 ̆ 2 <b>Hearsay,</b> your Honor. The computer <b>records</b> the prosecution is attempting to introduce do not satisfy the business records exception under Federal Rule of Evidence 803 (6). They were created in response to an attack, and were not maintained in the ordinary course of business. Consequently, they cannot be admitted under the Rules of Evidence and must be deemed inadmissible. 2 ̆ 2 The judge directs his attention to the prosecution. 2 ̆ 2 Counsel, are there any other exceptions these records fall under? 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 No, your Honor. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Objection sustained. 2 ̆ 2 This result may seem inequitable, but it is entirely possible given the current majority view on the nature of computer-generated records. This Note argues that the minority conception is the proper approach to judging computer-generated records 2 ̆ 7 admissibility. The minority approach recognizes the true nature of this type of record and is in accordance with the overall purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence: accuracy and truth in the fact-finding process. Part I demonstrates that a distinction exists between computer-stored and computer-generated records. A majority of courts largely ignore this distinction despite contravening precedent from several state courts. Part II then explains why computer-generated records as opposed to computer-stored records-should not be considered <b>hearsay</b> because these <b>records</b> do not fit into the definition of hearsay and they do not present the normal dangers associated with such statements. Part III advocates a test by which judges can distinguish between these two types of records. This Part also suggests ways in which federal and state judiciaries can reform faulty precedent and avoid the likely obstacles that will arise in such an endeavor...|$|R
