Classical results concerning the local isomorphism property and the “extraction preorder” for tilings are generalized to uniformly locally finite <b>relational</b> <b>structures.</b> Then, we define “equational structures”, which generalize both Cayley graphs of groups and <b>relational</b> <b>structures</b> associated to tilings, and for which we have an appropriate notion of free structure relative to a system of equations. For each finite system Σ of prototiles and local configurations, we give a finite set of local conditions characterizing the connected <b>relational</b> <b>structures</b> which are homomorphic images of Σ-tilings. It follows that tilings are free relative to finite systems of equations which express these conditions. We also prove that the theory of a tiling is superstable, model-complete, and can be axiomatized by ∀∃ sentences. One ∀∃ sentence suffices in the case of Penrose tilings or Robinson tilings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} paper, {{as we did}} {{previously}} in [5], we investigate {{the relations between the}} geometric properties of tilings and the algebraic and model-theoretic properties of associated <b>relational</b> <b>structures.</b> Our study is motivated by the existence of aperiodic tilings. In [5], we considered tilings of the euclidean spaces R k, and isomorphism was defined up to translation. Here, we consider, more generally, tilings of a metric space, and isomorphism is defined modulo an arbitrary group of isometries. The results of Sections 1 and 2 concern, in particular, the characterization of <b>relational</b> <b>structures</b> which can be represented by tilings of some given type, local isomorphism and the extraction preorder. In Section 3, we show that the notions of periodicity and invariance through a translation, defined for tilings of the euclidean spaces R k, can be generalized, with appropriate hypotheses, to <b>relational</b> <b>structures,</b> and in particular to tilings of non-euclidean spaces. In Section 4, we consider connected <b>relational</b> <b>structures</b> which are locally isomorphic to structures without non-trivial automorphism. We obtain a complete characterization in the case of uniformly locally finite structures which satisfy the local isomorphism property. We give several examples, some of them obtained by considering <b>relational</b> <b>structures</b> associated to tilings of euclidean or non-euclidean spaces...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} a general algebraic formulation {{for a wide}} range of combinatorial problems including Satisfiability, Graph Colorability and Graph Isomorphism In this formulation each problem instance is represented by a pair of <b>relational</b> <b>structures,</b> and the solutions to a given instance are homomorphisms between these <b>relational</b> <b>structures.</b> The corresponding decision problem consists of deciding whether or not any such homomorphisms exist. We then demonstrate that the complexity of solving this decision problem is determined in many cases by simple algebraic properties of the <b>relational</b> <b>structures</b> involved. This result is used to identify tractable subproblems of Satisfiability, and to provide a simple test to establish whether a given set of Boolean relations gives rise to one of these tractable subproblems...|$|R
50|$|A <b>relational</b> <b>structure</b> is {{different}} from a constraint satisfaction problem because a constraint is a relation and a tuple of variables. Also different {{is the way in}} which they are used: for a constraint satisfaction problem, finding a satisfying assignment is the main problem; for a relation structure, the main problem is finding the answer to a query.|$|E

We also provide a proof of concept for how our framework allows for cortically-inspired algorithms to perform analogical inference.
