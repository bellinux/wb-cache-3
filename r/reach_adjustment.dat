The new brakes make use of a hydraulic lever design with both lever <b>reach</b> <b>adjustment</b> and lever contact point adjustment, a first for road disc brakes. In May 2016 SRAM also released their new 1x12 drivetrain technology dubbed Eagle™ in both XX1 and X01 variants. It has received many awards globally {{in its first year}} of public availability from cycling publications due to its simplicity, versatility, and usable rider benefits. The new 1x12 drivetrain has a 500% gear range that is comparable to many 2x drivetrains on the market today. In October 2016 SRAM released the WiFLi version of its eTap rear derailleur to give eTap users wider cassette range options, including compatibility with cassettes with up to a 32-tooth large cog.|$|E
50|$|In August 2015 SRAM Corporation {{announced}} its wireless shifting system, eTap. The system had been extensively developed and secretly tested {{over several years}} from initial design to a stage win in the 2015 Tour de France. The front and rear derailleurs use direct-mount batteries and communicate wirelessly with the shifters through a proprietary wireless protocol developed by SRAM called, Airea (pronounced: area). A set of small satellite shifter buttons, called Blips, can {{be connected to the}} shift levers or aero shift module (BlipBox) and placed anywhere along the handlebars as part of the system. A maximum of four Blips can be used per bike. The company also took the opportunity to introduce a new shifting convention with this system. The right lever shifts the rear derailleur outboard, the left lever shifts the rear derailleur inboard, and pressing both levers together shifts the front derailleur. SRAM made the groupset available for purchase on complete bikes and as aftermarket components sold through dealers from Spring 2016. Eventually, extension of the system is expected to the company's lower group sets, such as SRAM Force. In May 2016 the company announced a hydraulic disc brake version of its wireless road group called SRAM RED eTap HRD. The new brakes make use of a hydraulic lever design with both lever <b>reach</b> <b>adjustment</b> and lever contact point adjustment, a first for road disc brakes.|$|E
40|$|The Adaptive Paddling Program at California Polytechnic State University has {{sponsored}} {{the construction of}} an adaptive kayak seat, the Tide Rider 360, to provide paddlers with disabilities sufficient trunk support while out on the water. In particular, this design focused on providing the least restrictive environment for all users while still providing sufficient lateral, neck, back, and hip support. This seat is intended for use in the quarterly Adaptive Paddling Program to allow people with disabilities to experience the joys of kayaking in the most comfortable and supportive environment possible. The following report details the background research, design development, manufacturing, and testing processes that went into designing this seat. It provides in-depth breakdowns on aspects such as the concept generation and material selection methods in order to prove that this kayak seat meets the requirements of the Adaptive Paddling Program. In particular, this seat was designed for use in marine environments with maximum levels of adjustability, support, and comfort. It was designed to fit to all different types of people in terms of weight, disability, and paddling ability. This kayak seat was manufactured out of aluminum tubing and joints, high density polyethylene sheets, and polyethylene foam. In addition to these materials, we added pre-manufactured wheelchair support components for the lateral supports, headrest, hip supports, and seat base. The total cost for the manufacturing of this prototype came out to be approximately $ 2100 and the final weight was just around 30 pounds. We conducted multiple levels of testing on the kayak seat, including a load test and in-pool assessment. Our load testing proved that the aluminum seat frame experiences minimal deflection and bending when subjected to a constant weight {{for an extended period of}} time. The in-pool testing verified that the seat is able to support a paddler while still allowing them a wide range of motion, if so desired. The prototype as is does have a few shortcomings, such as some hard to <b>reach</b> <b>adjustment</b> bolts, but the Adaptive Paddling Program still feels confident in the ability of this seat and the fulfillment of the preset requirements. We believe that with a few slight modifications to the seat back angle and some additional reach of the supports, this product would be able to change the lives of the participants in the Adaptive Paddling Program...|$|E

40|$|Online {{movement}} adjustments {{are crucial}} for daily life. This {{is especially true}} for leg movements in relation to gait, where failed adjustments can lead to falls, especially in elderly. However, most research has focused on <b>reach</b> <b>adjustments</b> following changes in target location. This arm research reports two categories of online adjustments (see Gaveau et al., Neuropsychologia 55 : 25 - 40, 2014 for review). Small, frequently undetected, target location shifts invoke fast, automatic adjustments, usually without awareness. In contrast, large target location shifts can lead to slow, voluntary adjustments. These fast and slow adjustments presumably rely on different neural networks, with a possible role for subcortical pathways for the fast responses. Do leg movement adjustments also fall into these two categories? We review the literature on leg movement adjustments and show that it is indeed possible to discern fast and slow adjustments. More specifically, we provide an overview of studies showing adjustments during step preparation, initiation, unobstructed, and obstructed gait. Fast adjustments were found both during stepping and gait. In the extreme case, even step adjustments appear to be further modifiable online, e. g., when avoiding obstacles during tripping. In older adults, movement adjustments are generally slower and of smaller magnitude, consistent with a greater risk of falling. However, fast responses seem less affected by aging, consistent with the idea of independent parallel mechanisms controlling movement adjustments (Gomi, Curr Opin Neurobiol 18 : 558 - 567, 2008). Finally, putative neural pathways are discussed...|$|R

40|$|For each of six old bipolar active regions, {{we present}} and {{interpret}} Yohkoh/SXT and SOHO/MDI {{observations of the}} development, over several days, of enhanced coronal heating {{in and around the}} old bipole in response to new magnetic flux emerge= within the old bipole. The observations show: 1. In each active region, new flux emerges in the equatorward side of the old bipole, around a lone remaining leading sunspot and/or on the equatorward end of the neutral line of the old bipole. 2. The emerging field is marked by intense internal coronal heating, and enhanced coronal heating occurs in extended loops stemming from the emergence site. 3. In five of the six cases, a "rooster tail" of coronal loops in the poleward extent of the old bipole also brightens in response to the flux emergence. 4. There are episodes of enhanced coronal heating in surrounding magnetic fields that are contiguous with the old bipole but are not directly connected to the emerging field. From these observations, we suggest that the accommodation of localized newly emerged flux within an old active region entails far <b>reaching</b> <b>adjustments</b> in the 3 D magnetic field throughout the active region and in surrounding fields in which the active region is embedded, and that these adjustments produce the extensive enhanced coronal heating. We also note that the reason for the recurrence of flux emergence in old active regions may be that active region flux tends to emerge in giant-cell convection downflows. If so, the poleward "rooster tail" is a coronal flag of a long-lasting downflow in the convection zone.

40|$|To {{test whether}} the most rapid {{visually}} evoked <b>reach</b> <b>adjustments</b> are cortically organized in humans, we have measured their latency {{in a healthy}} subject with complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. This condition precludes direct communication between left and right cerebral cortices and so, in this subject, a purely cortical visuomotor process {{would be expected to}} produce longer-latency responses to a target that appears in the visual hemifield contralateral to the responding limb (crossed) compared with the ipsilateral hemifield (uncrossed). As predicted, when performing simple reaction time tasks that involved lifting a finger or an arm in response to a visual stimulus presented to either hemifield, this acallosal subject showed a significant crossed-uncrossed latency difference (mean 35. 8 ms) that was not present in control subjects (group mean 2. 2 ms). In contrast, when she reached for a target that unexpectedly jumped into either visual hemifield, the latencies of mid-flight adjustment were the same (approximately 120 ms) irrespective of either the target jump direction or which hand was used. This was not due to an early movement of the eyes bringing the target back on to the fovea since this subject's finger always deviated towards the new target position in advance of her eyes. Neither could it be explained by the use of ipsilateral corticospinal projections since transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex failed to evoke ipsilateral responses in arm or hand muscles. These results suggest that, even in humans, subcortical structures are involved in the fastest <b>adjustments</b> of the <b>reaching</b> arm made in response to fresh visual information. An additional finding in this subject was that, when reaching, the eye saccadic latency was greater by 36 ms on average when the target jumped right compared with left, irrespective of which hand was being used. This is the same value as the mean interhemispheric transfer time obtained in the simple reaction time tasks and may indicate right-hemispheric dominance for saccadic eye movement control...|$|R

For instance, lungfish like Lepdosiren paradoxa may experience confination in a moist mud burrow and survive several months during the dry season (Dunn, 1983). There are four problems that emerge when fish is exposed to the air: 1) Their gas exchange apparatus is not able to perform O 2 uptake and CO 2 releasing, unless they have (like Lepidosirenidae and Synbranchidae) air breathing organs.

Objetivo: Verificar como as posições corporais afetam os ajustes proximais e distais do alcance manual de lactentes de quatro a seis meses. MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: Dez lactentes classificados como menos (n= 6) e mais habilidosos (n= 4) foram avaliados no mês de aquisição do alcance (M 1) e após um mês de prática espontânea (M 2), nas posições supina (0 º), reclinada (45 º) e sentada (70 º). Foram analisados os ajustes proximais (alcances uni ou bimanuais) e distais (mão aberta, semi-aberta ou fechada), posição das mãos no início do movimento (perto ou longe do corpo) e movimentos de preensão. RESULTADOS: Houve predomínio de alcances unimanuais para os lactentes mais habilidosos. Os lactentes menos habilidosos apresentaram maior freqüência de alcances unimanuais em M 1 (sentado) e M 2 (supino e sentado). Houve predomínio de alcances com as mãos semi-abertas, exceto para lactentes mais habilidosos em M 2 na posição reclinada. Lactentes menos habilidosos apresentaram mãos próximas ao corpo em M 1 (reclinado e sentado) e M 2 (reclinado), enquanto os mais habilidosos iniciaram seus alcances com as mãos longe do corpo em M 2 (supino).

BACKGROUND: Although {{the development}} of reaching under different body position conditions has been widely studied, little research has addressed this issue considering the infant’s skill level. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how different body positions affect proximal and distal <b>reaching</b> <b>adjustments</b> among four to six-month-old infants. Methods: Ten infants classified as less (n= 6) and more skilled (n= 4) were evaluated both in the month when they acquired reaching abilities (M 1) and after one month of spontaneous practice (M 2), in the supine (0 º), reclined (45 º) and seated (70 º) positions. Proximal (one or two-hand reaching) and distal (open, half-open or closed hand) adjustments, arm starting position (next to or {{away from the body}}) and grasping movements were analyzed. RESULTS: One-hand reaching predominated among the more skilled infants. Less skilled infants showed higher frequency of one-hand reaching in M 1 (seated) and M 2 (supine and seated). Reaching with the hands half-open predominated, except among the more skilled infants in M 2 in the reclined position. The less skilled infants presented hands next to the body in M 1 (reclined and seated) and in M 2 (reclined), while the more skilled ones started their reaching with hands away from the body in M 2 (supine). The more skilled infants performed more reaching followed by grasping in M 2, in the supine and seated positions.

However, industrial application of OCM is limited by low C 2 yields and large production of CO 2. Since the OCM reaction is based on catalysts surface and gas phase reactions, the fate of key intermediates like the methyl radicals and the collision probability of these radicals both in the gas phase and with the catalyst surface have a crucial impact on the C 2 selectivity. Collision of these radicals in the gas phase leads to primary ethane production while collision with the catalytic surface and/or the reactor walls leads to quenching and the subsequent production of CO 2. Barbé et al. have confirmed the beneficial effect of an increased gas phase volume for the C 2 selectivity at constant catalytic surface [1]. Their work suggests that a high C 2 yield could be <b>reached</b> via <b>adjustment</b> of the reactor geometry, i. e. the gas phase volume to the catalytic surface.

Topographic features on the sea-floor with lambda less than 1000 km {{were found to be}} compensated both regionally, by the elastic strength of the lithosphere, and locally, by displacing mantle material to <b>reach</b> isostatic <b>adjustment.</b> The larger-scale sea-floor topography and the corresponding geoid anomalies with lambda similar to 2000 km cannot be explained by either local or regional compensation. The topography and the resulting geoid anomaly at this wavelength were modeled by considering the dynamic effects arising from viscous stresses in a layer of fluid with a highly temperature-dependent viscosity for the cases of: (1) surface cooling, and (2) basal heating. In this model, the mechanical properties of the elastic part of the lithosphere were taken into account by considering an activation energy of about 520 kJ/mol in the Arrhenius law for the viscosity. Numerical predictions of the topography, total geoid anomaly, and admittance were obtained, and the results show that the thermal perturbation in the layer, which accounts for the mass deficit, must be located close to the surface to compensate the gravitational effect of the surface deformation. For the case of basal heating, the temperature dependence of viscosity results in a separation of the upper, quasi-rigid lid from the lower mobile fluid, hence inhibiting the development of a compensating thermal perturbation at shallow depths. The results clearly rule out small-scale, upper-mantle convection as the source of these anomalies. Instead, the geophysical observables can be well explained by a shallow, transient thermal perturbation...|$|R

Records of the patients were investigated retrospectively. We evaluated best corrected visual acuity, existence of ambliopia, postoperative duration following the first surgery and applied surgical procedures. Postoperative deviation lower than 10 PD were assesed as successful. Mean follow up period was 29, 8 +/- 21, 36 (8 - 80) months, patients with inadequate follow up period were dismissed from the study group. Results: We only applied bilateral medial rectus advancement surgery to 6 and unilateral medial rectus advancement surgery to 5 patients and obtained intended surgical result in these 11 cases. The other patients underwent lateral rectus recession or/and medial rectus resection operations inorder to reach projected deviation degrees. Deviation {{was found to be}} 46, 4 +/- 9, 24 (40 - 70) PD in cases who only underwent advancement surgery and was 65, 56 +/- 18, 78 (40 - 90) PD in cases who underwent additional surgical procedure. 16 (% 80) of the cases had hypermetropi various dioptries and 7 (% 35) had ambliopia.

40|$|Bed rest {{has been}} shown to have {{detrimental}} effects on structural and functional characteristics of the trunk muscles, possibly affecting trunk and spinal stability. This is especially important in populations such as aging adults with often altered trunk stabilizing functions. This study examined the effects of a fourteen-day bed rest on anticipatory postural adjustments and postural reflex responses of the abdominal wall and back muscles in sixteen adult men. Postural activation of trunk muscles was measured using voluntary quick arm movement and sudden arm loading paradigm. Measurements were conducted prior to the bed rest, immediately after, and fourteen days after the bed rest. Immediately after the bed rest, latencies of anticipatory postural adjustments showed significant shortening, especially for the obliquus internus and externus muscles. After a fourteen-day recuperation period, anticipatory postural <b>adjustments</b> <b>reached</b> a near to complete recovery. On the contrary, reactive response latencies increased from pre-bed-rest to both post-bed-rest measurement sessions. Results indicate an important effect of bed rest on stabilizing functions of the trunk muscles in elderly adults. Moreover, there proved to be a significant deterioration of postural reactive responses that outlasted the 14 -day post-bed-rest rehabilitation...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{enumerating}} and mapping the needs of the homeless. It compares tools for measuring homelessness which are described in literature and shows the way for implementation of measuring within the area of smaller municipalities. Findings about homelessness, homeless phenomenon and services for the homeless published in the literature are discussed {{at the beginning of the}} theoretical part. The core fragment of the theoretical part is devoted to a discussion on the basis and ways of measuring homelessness both in the Czech Republic and abroad. Different tools for measuring homelessness are compared in the thesis, appended with commentaries reflecting author's own multiyear experiences with providing services for target group and his involvement in surveys. The empirical part describes the process of verifying the applicability of the given methodology for enumerating and mapping the needs of homeless in practice. The procedures how author <b>reached</b> the final <b>adjustments</b> of the given methodology are described in this part. The modified methodology for counting and mapping the needs of homeless is presented in the conclusion. At final stage the modified methodology is compared with the methodology used for enumerating homeless in the United States...|$|R
40|$|Mitigation of {{agricultural}} N 2 O emissions via management requires quantitative {{information about the}} regulation of the underlying processes. In this laboratory study. short-term evolution of N 2 O from repacked soil was determined using an arable sandy loam soil adjusted to three water potentials (- 15,- 30 or - 100 hPa) that were <b>reached</b> by <b>adjustment</b> of partly air-dried soil with nutrient solutions or water; a water retention curve of repacked soil had been determined prior to the incubation experiment. The amendments included a control treatment receiving water (CTL), and aqueous solutions of carbon {{in the form of}} glucose (C). ammonium sulfate (N), or both (CN). Rates Of CO 2 and N 2 O evolution were followed during 14 days. Soil inorganic N and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition were analyzed by the end of incubation. Across all nutrient treatments, the soil at the lower moisture content (- 100 hPa) showed little or no N 2 O evolution irrespective of nutrient treatment Adding glucose alone reduced N 2 O evolution relative to CTL The addition of N alone had no effect on soil respiration, but significantly increased nitrate accumulation and N 2 O evolution. The CN treatment resulted in higher respiration than with C amendment alone, but less N 2 O evolution than with N alone, at least at - 15 and - 30 hPa. Whole-soil PLFA fingerprints at the end of incubation reflected the complex response of gaseous emissions. At - 15 hPa growth of Gram negative bacteria, probably including denitrifiers. in the CN treatment was indicated by low cyclopropane-to-precursor ratios. At - 100 hPa differentiation of branched-chain fatty acids was taken as evidence for an effect of C amendment on Gram positive bacteria. The highest potential for N 2 O evolution was observed at the intermediate soil wetness level; the corresponding gas diffusivities indicated that this parameter may be a better predictor of N 2 O emissions than water-filled pore space.

40|$|In {{response}} to {{various types of}} human disturbance, most Italian rivers have experienced considerable channel adjustment during the last centuries and in particular in the last decades. This paper reviews all existing published studies and available data, and aims to reconstruct a general outline of the main channel adjustments {{that have occurred in}} Italian rivers during the past 100 years. Two main types of channel adjustment have been recognized: (a) incision, which is commonly on the order of 3 – 4 m, but in some cases is even more than 10 m; (b) narrowing, with channel width reduction up to 50 % or more. In some <b>reaches,</b> these <b>adjustments</b> have led to changes in channel pattern in particular from braided to wandering. Such channel adjustments are due to several types of human intervention, particularly sediment extraction, dams and channelization. A strong temporal relationship (specifically, short reaction times) between human disturbance and channel adjustment can be inferred, but trends of adjustment are available for only a few rivers (e. g. the Po, the Arno and the Piave Rivers). These trends show that incision and/or narrowing are more intense immediately after the disturbance and then slow and become asymptotic; the same trends also suggest that larger rivers could have longer relaxation times. The results of this study are synthesised in a general classification scheme that summarises the main styles of adjustment observed in Italian rivers. According to the scheme, braided rivers adjust through prevalent narrowing with varying rates of incision, whereas single-thread rivers adjust mainly through a more pronounced incision accompanied by various amounts of narrowing. The scheme, representing initial and final (present) morphologies and not including intermediate stages of channel adjustment, will need to be tested on the basis of more detailed data to have a wider application both to the Italian context and to fluvial systems elsewhere, affected by similar types of human disturbance causing a reduction of sediment supply...|$|R
60|$|I {{regret to}} say that no {{conclusion}} has been <b>reached</b> for the <b>adjustment</b> of the claims against Great Britain growing out of the course adopted by that Government during the rebellion. The cabinet of London, so far as its views have been expressed, {{does not appear to}} be willing to concede that Her Majesty's Government was guilty of any negligence, or did or permitted any act during the war by which the United States has just cause of complaint. Our firm and unalterable convictions are directly the reverse. I therefore recommend to Congress to authorize the appointment of a commission to take proof of the amount and the ownership of these several claims, on notice to the representative of Her Majesty at Washington, and that authority be given for the settlement of these claims by the United States, so that the Government shall have the ownership of the private claims, as well as the responsible control of all the demands against Great Britain. It can not be necessary to add that whenever Her Majesty's Government shall entertain a desire for a full and friendly adjustment of these claims the United States will enter upon their consideration with an earnest desire for a conclusion consistent with the honor and dignity of both nations.|$|R
30|$|When a large vehicle {{reaches the}} bridge, its weight is {{measured}} with a load cell at {{the starting point of}} the bridge. When the measured force is uploaded into the system, a program is activated to calculate the counterforce required for controlling the deck deflection. The system calculates the cable tension (optimal counterforce) required to hold the main girder displacement under normal loads (allowable displacement) when the heavy vehicle reaches the first measurement point (A). Once the optimal counterforce is determined, instructions are sent to the actuator to start operation, stressing/releasing of stay cables starts and, at the same time, the monitoring system begins to measure cable tension. The decision-making function compares the measured cable tension with the optimal counterforce and repeatedly stresses and relaxes cable tension until an agreement is <b>reached.</b> When the <b>adjustment</b> of tension is finished, the load is moved to measurement point A where a displacement gauge is in place as shown in Figure  6. When the large vehicle reaches measurement point A, the above process is repeated for the next measurement point B. Operation is repeated from the time a large vehicle reaches the starting point of the bridge model until the vehicle reaches the end, and the deck deflection is measured each time the control measure is taken.|$|R

The case of a particular biphasic titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V known by its low machinability is investigated. The Johnson-Cook (JC) elasto-thermo-visco-plastic-damage model combined with the energy-based ductile fracture criteria is used. Segmentation frequency, chip curvature radius, shear band spacing, chip serration sensitivity and intensity, accumulated plastic strain in the formed chip segments, and cutting forces levels are determined where their dependency to every constitutive coefficient is examined and highlighted. It is demonstrated from the separate variation of every plastic and damage parameters that an interesting finite element modeling (FEM) relevance is <b>reached</b> with the <b>adjustment</b> of JC strain hardening coefficients term, thermal softening parameter, exponent fracture factor, and damage evolution energy. Moderate and high cutting speeds are applied to the cutting tool in the aim to test their impact on shear localization, chip segmentation, and numerical forces levels {{as well as to}} approve previous highlighted findings related to constitutive parameters definition. In general, this study focuses on a prominent decrease in identification process cost with the previous knowledge of the most affecting constitutive coefficients while keeping an interesting agreement between numerical and experimental results...|$|R

40|$|High {{temperature}} {{has been}} an obstacle to grow Rhododendron plants, and there are few reports on anatomical changes of Rhododendron plants under heat stress. To identify the mechanism of anatomical adjustment under high temperature, three Rhododendron species with different sensitivity to high temperature stress were selected to investigate the effect of heat stress on the anatomical structure. Heat stress resulted in stomatal closure and the decrease of stomatal density, however, the limited stomatal <b>adjustment</b> <b>reached</b> by R. fortune and R. mariesii may not prevent water loss effectively, of which the leaf thickness was reduced and obvious plasmolysis was observed in the mesophyll cells. R. simsii with smaller stomata and higher stomatal density had greater heat resistance than R. fortune and R. mariesii. Heat stress injured cell membrane structure seriously, and {{it was found that}} the nuclear membrane was digested and the nucleolus disappeared. The response of chloroplasts to high temperature was most sensitive, in which thylakoid lamellas became blurred, even degraded in heat–sensitive Rhododendron species. The thermal endurances were sequenced as follows: R. simsii, R. mariesii and R. fortunei. Greater heat resistance of R. simsii may be associated with stabilizing anatomical structure under high temperature. The results offered cytological evidence of adaptation for heat stress in heat resistant Rhododendron species...|$|R
