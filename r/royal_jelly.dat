5|$|Humans {{have kept}} honey bee colonies, {{commonly}} in hives, for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and <b>royal</b> <b>jelly</b> from hives; bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees {{for sale to}} other beekeepers.|$|E
5|$|Human {{beekeeping}} or apiculture {{has been}} practised for millennia, {{since at least}} the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce beeswax, <b>royal</b> <b>jelly</b> and propolis. Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature, from ancient times to the present day, though primarily focused in the Northern Hemisphere, where beekeeping is far more common.|$|E
30|$|The HRMAS {{has been}} also {{employed}} to examine cereals, cereal-derived, and apicultural products. This technique combined with HPLC analyses successfully discriminated Italian <b>Royal</b> <b>Jellies</b> from Chinese ones [68]. Moreover, an HRMAS approach was recently exploited to distinguish waxy from non-waxy Chinese rice grains, deriving from different Oryza sativa L. cultivars [69]. Both 1 H and 31 P HRMAS NMR spectra {{were used to}} elucidate the granule hydration in either wheat- or maize-derived starches at different temperatures [70]. Most interestingly, the authors modulated the MAS spin rate to distinguish between immobilized (water-inaccessible starch domains) and mobile components, thus inferring that their distribution depended on the starch granules assembly [70].|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{reliable}} database {{is established}} {{from the analysis}} of 500 French <b>royal</b> <b>jellies</b> (RJ). Diversity of geographical origins, harvesting seasons, and forage sources were taken into account. Authenticity intervals for numerous physicochemical parameters have been established from French RJs, obtained without bee-feeding with artificial sugars or proteins. RJs from Italy and non-European countries, derived from feeding experiments, were analysed and compared with the database. Differences in 10 -HDA, d 13 C and sugars (sucrose, erlose, maltose, maltotriose) contents were observed. Sucrose and erlose contents in French RJs were less than 1. 8 and 0. 4 %, respectively, whereas they attained 3. 9 and 2. 0 % in some commercial samples and 7. 7 and 1. 7 % in RJs produced by sugarcane feeding. Maltose and maltotriose contents were less than 1. 0 and 0. 2 % in French RJs, and they can attain levels of 2. 6 and 0. 4 % in commercial samples; they can {{be as high as}} 5. 5 and 1. 7 % in RJs obtained by bee-feeding with starch hydrolysate syrups. RJs obtained with and without feeding exhibit d 13 C values ranging from 26. 45 to 23. 73 %, and from 26. 05 to 14. 65 %, respectively. This study could be used to discriminate different production methods and provide a useful tool for identifying unknown commercial RJs. Highlights A total of 750 <b>royal</b> <b>jellies</b> (RJs) from different origins were studied. Origins included domestic, imported, obtained by bee-feeding. French RJ samples were chemically characterised. Authenticity intervals were calculated for authentic RJs. Sucrose, erlose, maltose, maltotriose and δ 13 C contents are bee-feeding markers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA gas chromatographic {{method was}} {{developed}} to quantify the major and minor sugars of 400 <b>Royal</b> <b>Jellies</b> (RJs). Their contents were compared {{in relation to the}} geographical origins and different production methods. A reliable database was established from the analysis of 290 RJs harvested in different French areas that took into account the diversity of geographical origin, harvesting season, forage sources available in the environment corresponding to natural food of the bees: pollen and nectar. Around 30 RJ samples produced by Italian beekeepers, about sixty-ones from French market, and around thirty-ones derived from feeding experiments were analysed and compared with our database. Fructose and glucose contents are in the range 2. 3 - 7. 8 % and 3. 4 - 7. 7 %, respectively, whatever the RJ's origin. On the contrary, differences in minor sugar composition are observed. Indeed sucrose and erlose contents in French RJs are lesser than 1. 7 % and 0. 3 %, respectively, whereas they reach 3. 9 % and 2. 0 % in some commercial samples and 5. 1 % and 1. 7 % in RJs produced from feeding experiments. This study could be used to discriminate different production methods and provide an additional tool for identifying unknown commercial RJs...|$|R
5|$|Practical uses include as food (entomophagy), in medicine, for the {{valuable}} textile silk, for dyestuffs such as carmine, in science, where the fruit fly {{is an important}} model organism in genetics, and in warfare, where insects were successfully used in the Second World War to spread disease in enemy populations. One insect, the honey bee, provides honey, pollen, <b>royal</b> <b>jelly,</b> propolis and an anti-inflammatory peptide, melittin; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include maggot therapy for wound debridement. Over a thousand protein families {{have been identified in}} the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may provide useful drugs such as anticoagulants, vasodilators, antihistamines and anaesthetics.|$|E
25|$|When {{conditions}} are favorable for swarming, the queen will start laying eggs in queen cups. A virgin queen will develop from a fertilized egg. The young queen larva develops differently {{because it is}} more heavily fed <b>royal</b> <b>jelly,</b> a protein-rich secretion from glands on the heads of young workers. If not for being heavily fed <b>royal</b> <b>jelly,</b> the queen larva would have developed into a regular worker bee. All bee larvae are fed some <b>royal</b> <b>jelly</b> for the first few days after hatching but only queen larvae are fed on it exclusively. As a result of the difference in diet, the queen will develop into a sexually mature female, unlike the worker bees.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} singly {{in a cell}} in a wax honeycomb, {{produced}} and shaped by the worker bees. Using her spermatheca, the queen can choose to fertilize the egg she is laying, usually depending on into which cell she is laying. Drones develop from unfertilised eggs and are haploid, while females (queens and worker bees) develop from fertilised eggs and are diploid. Larvae are initially fed with <b>royal</b> <b>jelly</b> produced by worker bees, later switching to honey and pollen. The exception is a larva fed solely on <b>royal</b> <b>jelly,</b> which will develop into a queen bee. The larva undergoes several moultings before spinning a cocoon within the cell, and pupating.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} feeding bees {{artificial}} sugars and/or proteins on the sugar compositions and (13) C isotopic measurements of <b>royal</b> <b>jellies</b> (RJs) were evaluated. The sugars fed to the bees were two C 4 sugars (cane sugar and maize hydrolysate), two C 3 sugars (sugar beet, cereal starch hydrolysate), and honey. The proteins fed to them were pollen, soybean, and yeast powder proteins. To evaluate {{the influence of}} the sugar and/or protein feeding over time, samples were collected during six consecutive harvests. (13) C isotopic ratio measurements of natural RJs gave values of around - 25 ‰, which were also seen for RJs obtained when the bees were fed honey or C 3 sugars. However, the RJs obtained when the bees were fed cane sugar or corn hydrolysate (regardless of whether they were also fed proteins) gave values of up to - 17 ‰. Sugar content analysis revealed that the composition of maltose, maltotriose, sucrose, and erlose varied significantly over time in accordance with the composition of the syrup fed to the bees. When corn and cereal starch hydrolysates were fed to the bees, the maltose and maltotriose contents of the RJs increased up to 5. 0 and 1. 3 %, respectively, compared to the levels seen in authentic samples (i. e., samples obtained when the bees were fed natural food: honey and pollen) that were inferior to 0. 2 % and not detected, respectively. The sucrose and erlose contents of natural RJs were around 0. 2 %, whereas those in RJs obtained when the bees were fed cane or beet sugar were as much as 4. 0 and 1. 3 %, respectively. The combination of sugar analysis and (13) C isotopic ratio measurements represents a very efficient analytical methodology for detecting (from early harvests onward) the use of C 4 and C 3 artificial sugars in the production of RJ...|$|R
25|$|Worker bees combine pollen, {{honey and}} glandular {{secretions}} and {{allow it to}} ferment in the comb to make bee bread. The fermentation process releases additional nutrients from the pollen and can produce antibiotics and fatty acids which inhibit spoilage. Bee bread is eaten by nurse bees (younger workers) who then produce the protein-rich <b>royal</b> <b>jelly</b> needed by the queen and developing larvae in their hypopharyngeal glands.|$|E
25|$|Beekeeping was {{traditionally}} practiced for the bees' honey harvest, although nowadays crop pollination {{service can}} often provide a {{greater part of}} a commercial beekeeper's income. Other hive products are pollen, <b>royal</b> <b>jelly,</b> and propolis, which are also used for nutritional and medicinal purposes, and beeswax, which is used in candle making, cosmetics, wood polish, and for modelling. The modern use of hive products has changed little since ancient times.|$|E
25|$|Honey bees obtain all {{of their}} {{nutritional}} requirements from a diverse combination of pollen and nectar. Pollen is the only natural protein source for honey bees. Adult worker honey bees consume 3.4-4.3mg of pollen per day to meet a dry matter requirement of 66-74% protein. The rearing of one larva requires 125-187.5mg pollen or 25-37.5mg protein for proper development. Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, ten of which are considered essential to honey bees: methionine, tryptophan, arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, leucine, and valine. Of these amino acids, honey bees require highest concentrations of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, however elevated concentrations of arginine and lysine are required for brood rearing. In addition to these amino acids, some B vitamins including biotin, folic acid, nicotinamide, riboflavin, thiamine, pantothenate, and most importantly, pyridoxine are required to rear larvae. Pyridoxine is the most prevalent B vitamin found in <b>royal</b> <b>jelly</b> and concentrations vary throughout the foraging season with lowest concentrations found in May and highest concentrations found in July and August. Honey bees lacking dietary pyridoxine were unable to rear brood.|$|E
500|$|When Sean Connery {{had been}} cast in November 1961, David Niven had been Fleming's {{choice for the}} role as the actor {{reflected}} his image of the character. In 1965 producer Charles Feldman signed Niven to play Sir James Bond for Casino Royale, a film not made by Eon Productions. Connery and Peter Sellers had both turned down the role. Niven was 56 when he played Bond and his characterisation was that of an elderly man who had won the Victoria Cross at the Siege of Mafeking, had a daughter by his lover, the spy Mata Hari, played Claude Debussy on the piano, ate <b>royal</b> <b>jelly</b> and cultivated black roses. The concept of Bond is that once Niven's Bond retired, his name and 007 designation was passed to another agent to keep the legend alive; James Chapman notes that the implication was that the [...] "other Bond" [...] was that played by Connery.|$|E

500|$|Honey bee {{products}} are used medicinally in apitherapy across Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, {{despite the fact}} that the honey bee was not introduced to the Americas until the colonization by Spain and Portugal. [...] They are by far the most common medical insect product both historically and currently, and the most frequently referenced of these is honey. It can be applied to skin to treat excessive scar tissue, rashes, and burns, and as an eye poultice to treat infection. Honey is taken for digestive problems and as a general health restorative. It is taken hot to treat colds, cough, throat infections, laryngitis, tuberculosis, and lung diseases. Apitoxin (honey bee venom) is applied via direct stings to relieve arthritis, rheumatism, polyneuritis, and asthma. [...] Propolis, a resinous, waxy mixture collected by honeybees and used as a hive insulator and sealant, is often consumed by menopausal women because of its high hormone content, and it is said to have antibiotic, anesthetic, and anti-inflammatory properties. <b>Royal</b> <b>jelly</b> is used to treat anaemia, gastrointestinal ulcers, arteriosclerosis, hypo- and hypertension, and inhibition of sexual libido. [...] Finally Bee bread, or bee pollen, is eaten as a generally health restorative, and is said to help treat both internal and external infections.

2500|$|If a queen {{suddenly}} dies, {{the workers}} {{will attempt to}} create an [...] "emergency queen" [...] by selecting several brood cells where a larva has just emerged which are then flooded with <b>royal</b> <b>jelly.</b> The worker bees then build larger queen cells over the normal-sized worker cells which protrude vertically {{from the face of}} the brood comb.

2500|$|In 1835 Dzierzon {{discovered}} that drones are produced from unfertilized eggs. Dzierzon's paper, published in 1845, proposed that while queen bees and female worker bees were products of fertilization, drones were not, {{and that the}} diets of immature bees contributed to their subsequent roles. His results caused a revolution in bee crossbreeding and may have influenced Gregor Mendel's pioneering genetic research. The theory remained controversial until 1906, the year of Dzierzon's death, when it was finally accepted by scientists {{at a conference in}} Marburg. In 1853 he acquired a colony of Italian bees to use as genetic markers in his research, and sent their progeny [...] "to all the countries of Europe, and even to America."

60|$|There {{is no room}} to {{tell how}} the {{experienced}} Melissa found a far-off frame so messed and mishandled by abandoned cell-building experiments that, for very shame, the bees never went there. How in that ruin she blocked out a Royal Cell of sound wax, but disguised by rubbish till {{it looked like a}} kopje among deserted kopjes. How she prevailed upon the hopeless Queen to make one last effort and lay a worthy egg. How the Queen obeyed and died. How her spent carcass was flung out on the rubbish heap, and how a multitude of laying sisters went about dropping drone-eggs where they listed, and said there was no more need of Queens. How, covered by this confusion, Sacharissa educated certain young bees to educate certain new-born bees in the almost lost art of making <b>Royal</b> <b>Jelly.</b> How the nectar for it was won out of hours in the teeth of chill winds. How the hidden egg hatched true--no drone, but Blood Royal. How it was capped, and how desperately they worked to feed and double-feed the now swarming Oddities, lest any break in the food-supplies should set them to instituting inquiries, which, with songs about work, was their favourite amusement. How in an auspicious hour, on a moonless night, the Princess came forth a Princess indeed, and how Melissa smuggled her into a dark empty honey-magazine, to bide her time; and how the drones, knowing she was there, went about singing the deep disreputable love-songs of the old days--to the scandal of the laying sisters, who do not think well of drones. These things are, written in the Book of Queens, which is laid up in the hollow of the Great Ash Ygdrasil.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{harvested}} {{by humans}} by stimulating colonies with movable frame hives to produce queen bees. <b>Royal</b> <b>jelly</b> is collected from each individual queen cell (honeycomb) when the queen larvae are about four days old. It is collected from queen cells {{because these are}} the only cells in which large amounts are deposited; when <b>royal</b> <b>jelly</b> is fed to worker larvae, it is fed directly to them, and they consume it as it is produced, while the cells of queen larvae are [...] "stocked" [...] with <b>royal</b> <b>jelly</b> much faster than the larvae can consume it. Therefore, only in queen cells is the harvest of <b>royal</b> <b>jelly</b> practical. A well-managed hive during a season of 5-6 months can produce approximately 500 g of <b>royal</b> <b>jelly.</b> Since the product is perishable, producers must have immediate access to proper cold storage (e.g., a household refrigerator or freezer) in which the <b>royal</b> <b>jelly</b> is stored until it is sold or conveyed to a collection center. Sometimes honey or beeswax {{is added to the}} <b>royal</b> <b>jelly,</b> which is thought to aid its preservation.|$|E
50|$|As the egg hatches, worker bees add <b>royal</b> <b>jelly</b> - a {{secretion}} from glands on {{the heads}} of young bees.
