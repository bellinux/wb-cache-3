40|$|The {{dissertation}} incorporates {{four separate}} essays addressing {{the economics of}} financial distress. While essays one and two examine the capital market reaction to security rating changes and bank failures, the last two offer methods for deposit insurance corporations to better handle distress among member financial institutions.;The first essay measures the impact of rating changes on equity returns. Pooled cross-section time series analysis allows testing of significance of changes in systematic risk as well as price. Tests of monthly and daily data indicated {{that there are no}} shifts in the systematic risk of firms experiencing rating changes after controlling for the effects of contemporaneous events. On average, a one-time drop in share price is observed for rating reductions, while no significant reaction is found for rating increases.;The second essay uses pooled cross-section time series analysis to investigate the capital market reaction to the failure of three Ontario trust companies, the bailout of the Canadian Commercial Bank (CCB) and subsequent <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> <b>deposits.</b> Even though the trust companies 2 ̆ 7 collapse was triggered by problems isolated to the troubled institutions, the prices of the non-failed trust companies 2 ̆ 7 shares fell.

With the financial crisis of 2007-08, this debt was becoming increasingly difficult to refinance, especially after the collapse in mid-September of U.S. financial-services firm Lehman Brothers.

50|$|In 1959, seven banks {{controlled}} by the erstwhile native states - including State Bank of Travancore - were nationalised by Government of India and made subsidiaries of State Bank of India. Towards {{the end of that}} year RBI, {{under the influence of the}} north Indian bankers' lobby, initiated a series of steps in Palai Central Bank. These steps, taken with the stated object of improving the Bank's working, were apparently aimed at wrecking the institution. It asked Joseph Augusti to retire from the board of directors of the Bank. Also, K M George was asked to step down from the post of chief executive officer and to continue as Secretary of the Bank. An outsider - an official of the State Bank of India - was appointed as the bank's new chief executive officer. Following these moves, some of the bank's depositors lost confidence in the institution and withdrew their deposits.

The occurrence of bank runs depends on complex interactions between people and their expectations, as individuals gain information not only through their own private information, but also through the informal observation of others. The interdependent relationship between investors and institutions in a bank run scenario has regained global attention with the ongoing worldwide recession and is exemplified by traditional commercial bank failures, spanning from the U. S. banking crisis during the 1930 ‟s to more recent examples today.

40|$|The {{simple answer}} to both {{questions}} {{in the title of}} this paper: No. We concentrate on three key aspects of the banking system’s difficulties during the 2001 – 02 crisis. Two are related to bank behavior (increasing dollarization of the balance sheet and expanding exposure to the government), and the other is related to the degree by which banks were hurt by depositor preferences, specifically, the <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>deposits</b> during 2001. We find that there was substantial cross-bank variation, that is, not all banks behaved equally nor were hurt equally by the macroeconomic shocks they faced during the run-up to the crisis. Furthermore, using panel data estimation, we find that depositors were able to distinguish high-risk from low-risk banks, and that individual bank’s exposure to currency and government default risk depended on fundamentals and other bank-specific characteristics. Finally, our results have implications for the existence of market discipline in periods of stress, and for banking regulation, which may have led banks to underestimate some of the risks they incurred.

40|$|Two {{traditional}} {{functions of}} banks include the screening and monitoring of borrowers and {{the supply of}} short term, liquid deposits. The joint offering of loan and deposit services is perceived as facilitating the collection of informations and the monitoring of borrowers. An important implication of the lending role of banks is that private infor-mation held on borrowers will make the secondary loan market fairly illiquid, and that banks will face the risk of <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>deposits.</b> As Professor BLATTNER (1996) recommends, any analysis of banking regulations must start with {{an analysis of the}} potential market failures in the functioning of private markets. Two such failures are identified. The first is the need to protect investors who are uninformed about the solvency of banks. Very much as consumers demand the public certification of the quality of medical services or food, uninformed investors demand the public certification of a minimum degree of solvency. Related to the protection of uninformed investors is the fear that shareholders of banks could exploit the uninformed investors by increasing the riskiness of the bank. Indeed, MERTON (1977) has shown that equity is similar to a call option, the value of which increases ceteris paribus with th...|$|E
40|$|This study empirically {{examines}} {{the stability and}} the main factors that have influenced the deposits in the Malaysian banking system. A structural model of the Malaysian money deposits applied to annual data for the 1983 - 2001 periods was designed. This structural model consists offve behavioural equations and three identities. A structural model functional form is used and estimated using the ordinary least squares in the log linear form. The behavioural equations are used to estimate the injluences of various factors on the conventional demand deposits, conventional time deposits, Islamic demand deposits, Islamic time deposits, and Islamic investment deposits. The implications of the study are {{that the increase in}} real gross domestic product, interest rate stability, and an increase in the profit-share for savings and investments are important for maintaining and enhancing the development of Malaysian money deposits. The results show that all the models (conventional and Islamic banks deposits) are stable; however Islamic demand deposits and Islamic time deposits are more stable than conventional demand deposits and conventional time deposits, because their Chow tests valzres are smaller than those of conventional deposits. The findings of this study suggests that as shariah compliant deposits are more stable than their conventional equivalents, then this makes a <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>deposits</b> less likely, reducing the potential amount of capital adequacy cover needed...|$|E

40|$|IN THIS PAPER, I {{attempt to}} add a few {{thoughts}} on the macroeconomic {{context in which the}} firm- and institution-level changes are taking place, with an emphasis on emerging markets. Financial Integration and Regulation The major presence of international firms in financial markets has made an important contribution to stability in domestic banking systems in a number of emerging-market economies. Argentina is a case in point. More than half of Argentina’s banking system now comprises large international institutions. This helped to build confidence in the banking system, which in turn helped to avoid a <b>run</b> <b>on</b> bank <b>deposits</b> after the Russian and Brazil-ian crises comparable to that following Mexico’s 1995 crisis.

40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper {{highlights}} the many and often perverse forms taken by the adjustment of State Owned Enterprises in Bulgaria since 1992. The differentiation into four clusters of unevenly performing State firms shows inter alia two important aspects in this process. First, a large number of heavily loss-making public enterprises has been allowed to survive since the beginning of transition {{at the expense of the}} rest of the economy, first of all the banks whose insolvency they contributed to while absorbing a large part of newly extended credits. However, as a rule, losses have been much financed more through informal or non-contractual means, mostly by the accumulation of interest and tax arrears, while in principle the impossibility of obtaining new external finance, or issuing equity after having lost all base capital should have made bankruptcy the only remaining solution. The second decisive aspect in the adjustment process is that more competitive, often profitable enterprises have also been accumulating large arrears towards other agents, with the banks again being the main victim. The implication is that arrears have been much larger than the mere financing of losses would have required, and have apparently been considered by a substantial number of enterprises as a current revenue flow rather than as a financing source. Indeed, SOEs as a whole have imposed informal revenue transfers to other agents averaging (on a conservative estimate), 28 % of their own value added per year between 1992 and 1995. The second part of the article analyses how the accumulation of enterprise arrears and of budget deficits, since 1992, has been absorbed without major financial disruptions. The evolution of the aggregate accounts for enterprises, government, households and the commercial banking sectors are then presented, so as to highlight three decisive factors in this exercise in crisis deferment. First, households have suffered large inflation taxes on their deposits, which have helped banks to rebalancing their balance sheets; second, despite these heavy wealth losses, private deposits in banks have kept increasing at sustained though declining rates till 1995, a trend which has limited the risk of an immediate liquidity crisis, notwithstanding the increasing insolvency of financial intermediaries; third, the State was able to post a large primary surplus in 1994 and 1995, which has also contributed to containing the financial tensions due to microeconomic indiscipline. However, the banking crisis has been gathering pace since the end of 1995 : a series of banks have been closed down and the Central bank has injected increasing amounts of reserve money in the banking sector, so as to reduce the risk of a systemic liquidity crisis and of a large-scale <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>deposits.</b> Large withdrawals were observed in April and May 1996, while a sharp foreign exchange crisis developed during the latter month, causing a total fall in the dollar value of the national currency of nearly 50 %. Hence, the major risk is that a sharp acceleration in inflation may increase the budget cash deficit (through the Tanzi effect) in the immediate future, leading possibly to high or even hyperinflation. Though such an issue would have very destructive immediate consequences, and would drastically reduce household wealth, it would also inflate away the largest part of the domestic public debt, as well as of the banks huge stock of non-performing loans. In the medium-term, this would provide the basis for re-establishing strong financial discipline on enterprises and banks, so as to set the Bulgarian transition on a more stable, promising course...|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} argued by some economists that {{financial}} liberalization and increased inflows of foreign capital, especially if short term, can aggravate illiquidity of banks and increase their vulnerability. In this context, ‘International Illiquidity’ refers to {{a situation in which}} a country’s short term financial obligations denominated in foreign/hard currency exceed the amount of foreign/hard currency that it can obtain on a short notice. Empirical evidence reveals that weak fundamentals alone cannot account for all foreign capital outflows, especially from emerging markets. Open economy extensions of the Diamond - Dybvig Model, where <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> domestic <b>deposits</b> interact with foreign creditor panics (depending on the maturity of the foreign debt and the possibility of international default), offer a plausible explanation for the financial crises that were observed in Mexico, East Asia, Russia etc. These models assert that international factors can play a particularly important role in increasing domestic financial vulnerability and likelihood of a liquidity crisis.|$|R

The market welcomed announcements that reflected the adoption of credible policies and demonstrated a firm commitment to the currency board. The authors also find that, after a period of higher volatility, the appointment of a new finance minister (after Domingo Cavallo left the finance ministry) calmed down stock and bond markets, significantly decreasing the variance in stock and bond market returns. On the other hand, the interest rate became more volatile after the appointment of the new finance minister and when reserve requirements were lowered.
