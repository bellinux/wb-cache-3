40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} {{the investment}} development path (IDP) of CEE countries and discusses their movement to its later stages, which is conditioned by in- crease in outward {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI). Providing evidence on data until 2012, it enables to test the impact of global financial crisis on the validity of IDP and the stages reached by particular CEE countries. Moreover, the thesis explores the effect of inward <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> on the ability to move to later stages through the relationship with outward FDI, which has not been tested in the literature yet. The thesis on a cross-sectional basis shows that: a) CEE countries follow IDP; however, when using subsamples, it holds only for more developed ones; b) contrary to literature before crisis, CEE countries did not reach the third stage of IDP, which suggests that crisis could have caused movement back along their IDP; c) <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> positively influ- ences outward FDI. According to the latter, countries with high <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and inward FDI stock are identified and is concluded that they are likely to enter the third stage of IDP.

40|$|We break average {{returns on}} value and growth {{portfolios}} into dividends and three sources of capital gain, (i) <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings,</b> (ii) convergence in price-to-book ratios (P/B) due to mean reversion in profitability, growth, and expected returns, and (iii) general upward drift in P/B during the 1963 - 2004 period. The contribution of drift to average returns is similar for value and growth portfolios, and relatively small. Dividends {{are important for}} value stocks, but <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> is a trivial factor in their capital gains. The high capital gains of value stocks trace mostly to convergence – P/B rises as value firms become more profitable and move to lower expected return groups. In contrast, dividends are less important for growth stocks, and reinvestment is the dominant positive factor in their capital gains. For growth stocks, convergence is negative – P/B falls because growth stocks do not always remain highly profitable with low expected returns.

Agents can either work for the foreign company or undertake entrepreneurial activities, which are subject to a fixed cost. Better financial markets allow agents to take advantage of knowledge spillovers from FDI, magnifying the output effects of FDI. Empirically, we show that well-developed financial markets allow significant gains from FDI, while FDI alone plays an ambiguous role in contributing to development.

3000|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) {{is defined as}} an investment involving a long-term relationship and reflecting a lasting interest and control by a resident entity in one economy (foreign direct investor or parent enterprise) in an enterprise resident in an economy other {{than that of the}} foreign direct investor (FDI enterprise or affiliated enterprise or foreign affiliate) [6]. According to the World Trade Organization [7], FDI occurs when an investor based in one country (the home country) acquires an asset in another country (the host country) with the intent to manage that asset [8]. The management dimension is what distinguishes FDI from portfolio investment in foreign stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. In most instances, both the investor and the asset it manages abroad are business firms. In such cases, the investor is typically referred to as the “parent firm” and the asset as the “affiliate” or “subsidiary.” FDI is the net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10 % or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor. It is the sum of equity capital, <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings,</b> other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments [6]. Studies have shown the special role of FDI in developing economies such as resolving employment issues [9], addressing the lack of investment capital [10], economic restructuring [10], providing modern technology, or transferring management experiences to local businesses. FDI is a type of long-term investment of individuals or companies in one country to another country by establishing the subsidiary companies or new businesses. Those individuals and companies will take the control of these enterprises. According to Law on Foreign Investment in Vietnam, 1996, FDI is “The foreign investors bring into Vietnam the capital or any assets to carry out investment activities in accordance with the law of Vietnam.” [...]...|$|E

This was accomplished by reviewing the inputs used in activities carried out by smallholders. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to analyze the inputs and outputs realized by different household investment choices. The Net Present Value (NPV), Equivalent Annual Income (EAI), Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of investments were estimated. The NPVs ranged between - 65, 750 Br/ha (- 2, 670 €/ha) and 1, 389, 920 Br/ha (56, 350 €/ha) over a 30 -year period at interest rates of 10, 20 and 30 %. The EAIs corresponded with the NPVs, and were used in comparison with agricultural crops. In almost all cases EAI of E. globulus exceeded that of other crops. BCRs varied from 0. 13 to 118 at an interest rate of 10 %. The maximum IRR achieved was 383 % and the minimum was ? 4 %. The average IRR was 60 %. Additionally, the financial returns for revenue from sales, cost savings from household consumption and reinvestment were analyzed in five scenarios. Reinvestment in rental homes proved the most lucrative return, followed by use of poles for home construction, for fuelwood consumption, and, finally, only for sale. Additional use of wood at home or <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> was more profitable than only selling poles on the local market. The study found that most households have profitable financial returns from investment in E. globulus. Those households with negative returns may plant for non-monetary benefits or carry out non-profit maximizing behaviour due to personal, cultural, or other reasons not captured in this analysis. It is believed that continued adoption of E. globulus will plateau in the near future. This study suggests a number of measures that could be implemented to increase returns and reduce costs including: co-operative development, recognition of smallholder plantations by government, and tenure security improvements...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the multinational firm's choice of debt or internal funds {{as a method}} of financing depends upon the cost of using internal funds. I extend prior research by differentiating between the cost of using domestic versus foreign internal funds for additional investments for multinational enterprises. I predict that foreign funds are more costly than domestic funds because of potential differential costs, including repatriation tax costs and financial reporting costs. I find that my measure of total funds, the sum of cash and short-term receivables, is negatively related to issuing incremental debt. I also examine whether the proportion of total funds represented by foreign funds affects a firm's decision to use incremental debt financing. My proxy for foreign funds is a rough estimate using available Compustat data (foreign assets divided by total assets multiplied by total funds). I do not find significant results with this general measure of foreign funds. Additionally, I test whether firms' FTC positions affect incremental financing decisions. I do not find results with this measure of foreign funds. I further examine the impact of costly foreign funds on the incremental debt financing decision using alternative measures. I examine the differential costs of a subset of foreign funds with the designation and dollar level <b>of</b> permanently reinvested <b>earnings.</b> My results suggest that the change in debt is positively related to the dollar level <b>of</b> permanently reinvested <b>earnings.</b> In addition, in a model that includes the interaction between the dollar level <b>of</b> permanently reinvested <b>earnings</b> and non-binding FTC status, my results suggest that the magnitude {{of the relationship between the}} level <b>of</b> permanent <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>earnings</b> and incremental debt financing is greater for firms with non-binding FTC limitations than for firms with binding FTC limitations.

40|$|This paper investigates {{factors that}} {{influence}} the amount <b>of</b> foreign retained <b>earnings</b> permanently reinvested abroad and the market valuation <b>of</b> these <b>earnings.</b> I {{examine the effects of}} repatriation taxes and the difference between foreign and domestic profitability on the amount <b>of</b> foreign subsidiary <b>earnings</b> that firms reinvest abroad using the permanently reinvested earnings designation as a proxy for foreign retained earnings. This extends prior work that examines the effect of repatriation taxes on repatriations by including both foreign and domestic profitability and by allowing the effects to vary by the firm's foreign tax credit position. The results are consistent with the hypotheses and indicate that foreign retained earnings increase with the difference between foreign and domestic after-tax-returns. Foreign retained earnings decrease with the foreign tax rate for firms in binding foreign tax credit positions, but are not related to the foreign tax rate for firms in nonbinding foreign tax credit positions. Next, I examine how earnings management incentives affect the amount <b>of</b> foreign subsidiary <b>earnings</b> designated as permanently reinvested, controlling for the effects of profitability and repatriation taxes. I examine whether firms that are close to debt covenant violation or that fail to meet their target earnings have higher permanently reinvested earnings. The permanently reinvested earnings designation provides the opportunity to manage earnings because U. S. repatriation taxes need not be recognized in financial statement income if the earnings are designated as permanently reinvested. I find no evidence <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management to meet debt covenants; however, I do find evidence <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management to meet target earnings. Finally, I examine the market valuation of taxes on permanently reinvested earnings and whether this valuation differs for earnings managers and non-earnings managers. I hypothesize that because the tax estimate is undiscounted, the market values taxes on permanently reinvested earnings more negatively for earnings managers than for non-earnings managers because it perceives the investment to be of a shorter duration. The results support this hypothesis and suggest that the market recognizes earnings management attempts and values the tax estimate as if the <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> foreign subsidiary <b>earnings</b> by earnings managers is not permanent...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Prior studies provide mixed propositions {{on whether}} {{earnings}} levels or earnings changes provide the better explanatory power for variations of stock returns {{and whether the}} time-series behavior <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> affects the value relevance <b>of</b> both <b>earnings</b> variables. This paper aims to compare the value relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels with that <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> changes in the return-earnings relations. Design/methodology/approach - The unobservable components model is used to estimate permanent and transitory components <b>of</b> <b>earnings.</b> Findings - The finding shows that the proxy ability <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> changes for unexpected earnings is sensitive to a firm's time-series earnings permanence property and is unstable and noisy when earnings contain predominantly transitory components, but that <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels is not. The results support earnings levels are a stable and better value relevant proxy in the return-earnings relations. Research limitations/implications - The findings imply that the valuation role <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels {{is important in the}} research relating to earnings components, earnings innovations, and equity valuation, especially when <b>earnings</b> permanence is <b>of</b> interest. Practical implications - The results provide a new understanding on the role <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels in many business decisions such as executive compensations, institutional investment and conservative accounting where they often involve the choice of using levels and/or changes <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> variables in making decisions.
