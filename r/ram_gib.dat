40|$|Neuromorphic {{systems have}} been {{increasing}} in size and complexity in recent years, thanks also {{the adoption of the}} Address-Event Representation (AER) as a standard for transmitting signals among chips, and building multi-chip event-based systems. AER mapper devices that route Address-Events from multiple sources to different multiple destinations are crucial components of these systems, as they allow users to flexibly compose multi-chip setups, re-configure them, and program different architecture or network topologies. In this paper we present a PCI based high-fanout AER mapper with 2 <b>GiB</b> <b>RAM</b> look-up table, 0. 8 μs latency and 66 MHz output event-rate. Integrated with a PC it forms a very flexible and affordable AER experimental platform which is suitable for prototyping and research projects. Indeed, multiple instances of this system are already being used to perform various types of AER experiments. In addition, the system's ability to implement probabilistic address-event mappings further extends the range of experiments that can be performed using this platform. We describe the hardware system implementation details, compare our approach to previously proposed ones, and present experimental results which demonstrate how the system provides optimal performance for experiments with high average fanout and how for low fanout mappings the limiting factor is given by the 0. 8 μs latency induced by the PC on each random memory access...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith {{increased}} use of forensic memory analysis, the soundness of memory acquisition becomes more important. We therefore present a black box analysis technique in which memory contents are constantly changed via our payload application with a traceable access pattern. This way, given the correctness of a memory acquisition procedure, we can evaluate its atomicity and one aspect of integrity as defined by Vömel and Freiling (2012). We evaluated our approach on several memory acquisition techniques represented by 12 memory acquisition tools using a Windows 7 64 -bit operating system running on a i 5 - 2400 with 2 <b>GiB</b> <b>RAM.</b> We found user-mode memory acquisition software (ProcDump, Windows Task Manager), which suspend the process during memory acquisition, to provide perfect atomicity and integrity for snapshots of process memory. Cold-boot attacks (memimage, msramdump), virtualization (VirtualBox) and emulation (QEMU) all deliver perfect atomicity and integrity of full physical system memory snapshots. Kernel level software acquisition tools (FTK Imager, DumpIt, win 64 dd, WinPmem) exhibit memory smear from concurrent system activity reducing their atomicity. There integrity is reduced by running within the imaged memory space, hence overwriting part of the memory contents to be acquired. The least amount of atomicity is exhibited by a DMA attack (inception using IEEE 1394). Further, even if DMA is performed completely in hardware, integrity violations {{with respect to the}} point in time of the acquisition let this method appear inferior to all other methods. Our evaluation methodology is generalizable to examine further memory acquisition procedures on other operating systems and platforms...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} engineering of algo-rithms for computing visibility maps on massive grid ter-rains. Given a terrain T, specified by the elevations of points in a regular grid, and given a viewpoint v, the visibility map or viewshed of v is the set of grid points of T that are visible from v. We describe three new algorithms to compute the viewshed for any given terrain T and viewpoint v. The first two algorithms “sweep ” the terrain by rotating a ray around the viewpoint while maintaining the terrain profile along the ray. On a terrain of n grid points, these algorithms run in O(n logn) time and O(sort(n)) I/Os in the I/O-model of Aggarwal and Vitter. The difference be-tween the two algorithms is in the preprocessing before the sweep: the first algorithm sorts the grid points into concen-tric bands around the viewpoint; the second algorithm sorts the grid points into sectors around the viewpoint. The third algorithm sweeps the terrain centrifugally, growing a star-shaped region around the viewpoint while maintaining the approximate visible horizon of the terrain within the swept region. This algorithm runs in O(n) time and O(scan(n)) I/Os and is cache-oblivious. We tested our algorithms on NASA SRTM data, and found that our fastest new algorithm computes the viewshed of a terrain of 7. 6 billion points (28. 4 GiB) in 203 minutes on a machine with 0. 5 <b>GiB</b> <b>RAM</b> and a laptop-speed hard drive. Depending on the data set, the new algorithm is 20 to 50 {{times faster than the}} algorithm from our previous work...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Many {{planning}} methods for high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment planning require an iterative approach. A set of computational parameters are hypothesized {{that will give}} a dose plan that meets dosimetric criteria. A dose plan is computed using these parameters, and if any dosimetric criteria are not met, the process is iterated until a suitable dose plan is found. In this way, the dose distribution is controlled by abstract parameters. The {{purpose of this study}} is to improve HDR brachytherapy planning by developing a new approach that directly optimizes the dose distribution based on dosimetric criteria. Method: We develop Inverse Planning by Integer Program (IPIP), an optimization model for computing HDR brachytherapy dose plans and a fast heuristic for it. We used our heuristic to compute dose plans for 20 anonymized prostate cancer patient image data sets from our clinic database. Dosimetry was evaluated and compared to dosimetric criteria. Results: Dose plans computed from IPIP satisfied all given dosimetric criteria for the target and healthy tissue after a single iteration. The average target coverage was 95 %. The average computation time for IPIP was 30. 1 seconds on a Intel(R) CoreTM 2 Duo CPU 1. 67 GHz processor with 3 <b>Gib</b> <b>RAM.</b> Conclusion: IPIP is an HDR brachytherapy planning system that directly incorporates dosimetric criteria. We have demonstrated that IPIP has clinically acceptable performance for the prostate cases and dosimetric criteria used in this study, both in terms of dosimetry and runtime. Further study is required to determine if IPIP performs well for a more general group of patients and dosimetric criteria, including other cancer sites such as GYN.
