5|$|The, Tennessee Walking Horse or Tennessee Walker is a {{breed of}} gaited horse {{known for its}} unique four-beat running-walk and flashy movement. It was {{originally}} developed in the southern United States for use on farms and plantations. It is a popular <b>riding</b> <b>horse</b> due to its calm disposition, smooth gaits and sure-footedness. The Tennessee Walking Horse is often seen in the show ring, but is also popular as a pleasure and trail <b>riding</b> <b>horse</b> using both English and Western equipment. Tennessee Walkers are also seen in movies, television shows and other performances.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Kathiawari was {{considered}} a good cavalry mount. It was used by Maratha cavalry, and later – {{until the end of}} the First World War – by the Indian Army. In modern times it is used as a <b>riding</b> <b>horse</b> or as a harness horse. Some are used by Indian police forces, sometimes for tent-pegging, to which the Kathiawari is well suited. In 1995, annual breed shows were hosted by the breed association.|$|E
5|$|The Castillonais or Cheval Ariègeois de Castillon, {{once called}} the cheval du Biros or Saint-Gironnais, {{is an ancient}} breed of small <b>riding</b> <b>horse</b> from the Ariège département of southwestern France. The breed's {{phenotype}} is currently in flux, but overall it resembles (and is sometimes confused with) the more common Merens horse. Members of the breed are either dark bay or black, and all have pangare color modification, which results in paler color around the eyes and muzzle and {{on the underside of}} the body. Today it is used principally for pleasure riding (including equine tourism) and driving.|$|E

40|$|Assessments of the {{behavior}} of <b>ridden</b> <b>horses</b> form the basis of performance evaluation. The purpose of any performance being evaluated will determine the factors considered important, those indicative of 'poor' performance and what makes a successful equine athlete. Currently there is no consistent objective means of assessing <b>ridden</b> <b>horse</b> behavior and inevitably, given the different equestrian disciplines, the likelihood of a universal standard of good and bad performance is remote. Nevertheless, {{in order to protect the}} welfare of the <b>ridden</b> <b>horse</b> regardless of its specific role, we should strive for consensus on an objective means of identifying behavioral signs indicative of mental state. Current technological developments enable objective evaluation of movement patterns, but many aspects of the assessment of ridden behavior still rely on subjective judgement. The development of a list of behaviors exhibited by <b>ridden</b> <b>horses,</b> a <b>ridden</b> <b>horse</b> ethogram, will facilitate recording of observable behavioral events. However, without objective evidence of the relevance of these behavioral events, such a resource has limited value...|$|R

5|$|The Selle Français (SF) is a {{breed of}} sport horse from France. It is renowned {{primarily}} for its success in show jumping, but many {{have also been}} successful in dressage and eventing. An athletic horse with good gaits, it is usually bay or chestnut in color. The Selle Français was created in 1958 when several French <b>riding</b> <b>horse</b> breeds were merged into one stud book. The new breed was meant {{to serve as a}} unified sport horse during a period when horses were being replaced by mechanization and were transforming into an animal used mainly for sport and leisure.|$|E
5|$|The Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse is a horse breed {{from the}} U.S. state of Kentucky. Developed as an {{all-around}} farm and <b>riding</b> <b>horse</b> in eastern Kentucky, it {{is related to}} the Tennessee Walking Horse and other gaited breeds. In 1989 the Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse Association (KMSHA) was formed, and in 2002, the subsidiary Spotted Mountain Horse Association (SMHA) was developed to register Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horses with excessive white markings and pinto patterns. Conformation standards are the same for the two groups of horses, with the main difference being the color requirements. The KMSHA studbook is now closed to horses from unregistered parents, although it cross-registers with several other registries, while the SMHA studbook remains open.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1850s, {{with the arrival of}} the Second French Empire, the Anglo-Norman became a popular breed in France, {{competing}} with the Thoroughbred. It was reputed to be a versatile horse, appropriate for riding and pulling light carriages. From 1840 to 1860, the breed was further influenced by part-Thoroughbred trotting horses from England. Local Norman mares were crossed with imported Thoroughbreds, Norfolk Trotters, Orlov Trotters and other crossbred horses, which themselves had Norfolk and Mecklenburger blood. By 1855, the quality of the resulting animals had ensured the breed's success, and the Anglo-Norman spread throughout France, especially supplanting another type of <b>riding</b> <b>horse</b> from the south, the Limousin horse. In 1864, the Société du cheval français de demi-sang (Society of French Half-Blood Horses) was founded, which later became the Société d'encouragement à l'élevage du cheval français (Society to Encourage French Horse Breeding). The breeders spread the description of Norman horses, particularly Anglo-Normans, as versatile horses that could be used for both riding and driving.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Finnhorse's {{image as}} a working farm horse, the breed {{was used as a}} cavalry mount from the 17thcentury until the end of World War II. After the {{mechanisation}} of Finnish agriculture in the 1960s and the 1970s, however, it was not clear if the Finnhorse would make the transition into a <b>riding</b> <b>horse,</b> even though the long use of the breed by the Finnish cavalry had proven it well-suited for the job. The Finnhorse had a strong {{image as a}} harnessed working horse, associated with rural life and old times. When riding as a hobby emerged and became more established in Finnish cities during the 1960s, imported horses and ponies were preferred as mounts; warmblooded horses represented modern times, leisure time and wealth, while the Finnhorse was viewed as rugged and unsophisticated. The riding section studbook, created in 1971, grew slowly and gained only a few dozen horses during its first decade, as the idea of a Finnhorse used for riding was considered near-ridiculous at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Spotted Saddle Horse is a horse breed {{from the}} United States that was {{developed}} by crossing Spanish-American type gaited pinto ponies with gaited horse breeds, such as the Tennessee Walking Horse. The result was a colorful, smooth-gaited horse, used in the show ring and for pleasure and trail riding. Two registries have been created for the breed, one in 1979 {{and the other in}} 1985. The two have similar registration requirements, although one has an open stud book and the other is slightly more strict with regard to parentage requirements, having a semi-closed stud book. The Spotted Saddle Horse is a light <b>riding</b> <b>horse,</b> always pinto in color. Solid-colored foals from registered parents may be registered for identification purposes, so their pinto-colored foals have documented parentage. They always perform an ambling gait, rather than a trot, in addition to the gaits of walk and canter, performed by all breeds.|$|E
5|$|Eduard Peter Nicolaas Stibbe, known also as Eddy Stibbe, {{competed for}} the Netherlands Antilles as its only equestrian athlete. Stibbe competed in {{individual}} eventing. Born in 1948 in 's-Hertogenbosch, Stibbe first competed, aged 23, in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, riding the horse Autumn Flash and representing the Netherlands. He returned {{at the age}} of 43 to the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, riding Olympic Bahlua on the Netherlands' behalf. At age 51, Stibbe represented the Netherlands Antilles {{for the first time at}} the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia on horse Eton, finishing his event for the first time. He returned again to the Olympics {{at the age of}} 55, <b>riding</b> <b>horse</b> Dusky Moon, for his fourth Olympic appearance and sixth Olympic event. On August 16, Stibbe faced 74 other athletes during the dressage portion of the event. The Dutch Antillean competitor accrued 57.80 penalty points but was awarded 62.40 points by one judge and 61.20 points by another, tying Jaroslav Hatla of the Czech Republic for 38th place. During the August 17 cross-country phase of the event, Stibbe accrued 49.20 penalty points (20 from jumping, 29.20 from time), finishing the race in 10:59. This placed him at 60th place of the 71 athletes who advanced to the cross-country round. Overall, at this point, Eddy Stibbe's combined point values placed him at 58th place.|$|E

25|$|Much {{speculation}} {{has taken}} place {{about the nature of}} destriers and about the size they attained. They apparently were not enormous draft types. Recent research undertaken at the Museum of London, using literary, pictorial and archeological sources, suggests war horses (including destriers) averaged 14–15 hands, and differed from a <b>riding</b> <b>horse</b> in their strength, musculature and training, rather than in their size. An analysis of medieval horse armour located in the Royal Armouries indicates the equipment was originally worn by horses of 15 to 16 hands, about the size and build of a modern field hunter or ordinary <b>riding</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E

25|$|Medieval Europe bred large horses {{specifically}} for war, called destriers.
