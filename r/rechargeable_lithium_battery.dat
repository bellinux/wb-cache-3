50|$|Whittingham is a {{key figure}} {{in the history of the}} {{development}} of lithium batteries discovering the concept of intercalation electrodes. Exxon manufactured in 1970s Whittingham's <b>rechargeable</b> <b>lithium</b> <b>battery,</b> which was based on a titanium disulfide cathode and a lithium-aluminum anode. However, this <b>rechargeable</b> <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> could never be made practical. Titanium disulfide was a poor choice, since it has to be synthesized under completely sealed conditions. This is extremely expensive (~$1000 per kilo for titanium disulfide raw material in 1970s). When it is exposed to air, it stinks because the moisture in the air reacts with titanium disulfide to make hydrogen sulfide. Because this material was unworkable, Exxon finally killed lithium-titanium disulfide battery. Batteries with metallic lithium electrodes presented safety issues, as lithium is a highly reactive element; it burns in normal atmospheric conditions because of the presence of water and oxygen. As a result, research moved to develop batteries where, instead of metallic lithium, only lithium compounds are present, being capable of accepting and releasing lithium ions.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. K.M. Abraham is {{a pioneer}} in the {{research}} and development of rechargeable lithium and lithium-ion batteries. His research to demonstrate a practical <b>rechargeable</b> <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> began in the late nineteen seventies when no such rechargeable batteries existed. He and his colleagues pursuant to the development of stable electrolytes to recharge the lithium electrode [...] demonstrated one of the first sealed high capacity <b>rechargeable</b> <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> exhibiting several hundred charge/discharge cycles, a feat not accomplished until that time. This work was the forerunner to the commercially successful Li-ion batteries. Another contribution of Dr. Abraham and his colleagues involved the development of highly conductive gel polymer electrolytes and those supported on micro-porous polymer membranes. Today such separator-embedded gel polymer electrolytes are used to build the commercially successful lithium-ion polymer batteries. Other pioneering contributions of Dr. Abraham include rechargeable sodium battery chemical couples that operate at moderately high temperatures, the very high energy density non-aqueous lithium-sulfur battery, the ultrahigh energy density non-aqueous lithium-air battery, [...] and the fundamental principles underlying the concept of chemical over charge protection of rechargeable lithium and Li-ion batteries. The research and development of lithium-air batteries is pursued world-wide for portable power, electric vehicles and large scale energy storage. His unique background encompasses both the fundamental science and engineering development of advanced batteries.|$|E
