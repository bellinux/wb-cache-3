This paper proposes a probabilistic methodology to study the slope stability on the long-term, considering different hydro-climatic conditions and the effect of vegetation cover in the soil moisture. The ecohydrological model developed by Rodríguez-Iturbe et al. [1] was used to determine the boundary conditions of the problem. To generate the pore pressure field, the flow equation was solved using the Finite Element Method and Finite Differences Method. Finally, the Limit Equilibrium Method was used to find the Factor of Safety. The stability of a hypothetical slope under certain hydro-climatic conditions and two types of vegetation was evaluated. The analysis showed that it is more likely that a grass-covered slope slides than a tree-covered slope, and that the average FS of the slope during wet and dry season is very similar, but the FS dispersion is higher when the probability and intensity of rainfall events increases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Regardless of the {{intensity}} of use, athletic fields are expected to provide a safe stable playing surface. As field use increases, wear caused by foot traffic {{can result in a}} loss of both turfgrass coverage and surface stability, increasing the risk of athlete injury. As surface stability is reduced, susceptibility to divoting is increased. The effect of synthetic soil reinfor-cements on the divot resistance of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) under various simu-lated traffic levels was investigated. Soil-reinforcing materials improved divot resistance most under high traffic. Because the plant growth regulator trinexapac-ethyl (TE) has been shown to increase tiller density and rooting, its effect on divot resistance was evaluated on turfgrass grown on a sand root zone. TE (0. 17 kg active ingredient/ha) was applied to Kentucky blue-grass (Poa pratensis L.) at 28 day intervals from either May to July or May to October. Plots were subjected to various levels of simulated traffic in the fall. Compared with the control, the application of TE from May to July resulted in the highest divot resistance. Various meth-ods such as the inclusion of soil <b>reinforcements</b> and <b>plant</b> growth regulator applications can be used to decrease susceptibility to divoting...|$|R

A cofferdam is a temporary structure designed to keep water and soil out of the excavation in which a bridge pier or other structure is built. When construction must take place below the water level, a cofferdam is built to give workers a dry work environment. Sheet piling is driven around the work site, seal concrete is placed into the bottom to prevent water from seeping in from underneath the sheet piling, and the water is pumped out. There are different types of cofferdam, some are used to support excavation operation and some are enclosed type box placed in the water. The present case study deals with step by step procedure adopted at Sabah International Convention Centre and Jesselton Residence which is both located at Kota Kinabalu Sabah.

This <b>reinforcement</b> of <b>plants</b> may provide {{protection}} to {{various forms of}} biotic and abiotic stress. To determine the genetic traits involved in the mechanism of plant-bacteria association, the genome sequence of UCMB 5113 was obtained by assembling paired-end Illumina reads. The assembled chromosome of 3, 889, 532 bp was predicted to encode 3, 656 proteins. Genes that potentially contribute to plant growth promotion such as indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis, acetoin synthesis and siderophore production were identified. Moreover, annotation identified putative genes responsible for non-ribosomal synthesis of secondary metabolites and genes supporting environment fitness of UCMB 5113 including drug and metal resistance. A large number of genes encoding a diverse set of secretory proteins, enzymes of primary and secondary metabolism and carbohydrate active enzymes were found which reflect a high capacity to degrade various rhizosphere macromolecules. Additionally, many predicted membrane transporters provides the bacterium with efficient uptake capabilities of several nutrients. Although, UCMB 5113 has the possibility to produce antibiotics and biosurfactants, the protective effect of plants to pathogens seems to be indirect and due to priming of plant induced systemic resistance.

30|$|This paper {{describes}} a unique quantitative approach that combines information about root distribution and root mechanical data {{in order to}} calculate the spatial distribution of root reinforcement {{as a function of}} tree dimension and distance between ‘Veronese’ poplar trees. The results were used to formulate guidelines for the planning of bioengineering measures with the aim of reducing erosion on pastoral hill slopes in New Zealand. The calculations show that the definition of effective planting density for the same poplar clone ‘Veronese’ {{is a function of the}} local root growing condition, the slope inclination, and the soil mechanical properties (effective friction angle and cohesion). Generally, it can be concluded that planting density that ranges between 330 and 160  sph (corresponding to stem distance of 5.5 and 8  m, respectively) would assure significant root reinforcement for slope stabilisation (> 2  kN m− 1) and reduce the volume of triggered shallow landslides by up to 100  %. In ideal growing conditions, tree spacing starting from 100  sph is sufficient for stem DBH larger than 0.15  m to assure enough root <b>reinforcement.</b> A lower <b>planting</b> density would lead to less lateral root reinforcement, and the contribution of vegetation to slope stability would probably be limited to the hydrological effects.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} goals of {{evolutionary}} biology is understanding the process of species formation. There is particular interest in how selection can favor species formation {{through the process of}} reinforcement. When two diverging taxa produce maladaptive hybrids, selection will favor greater reproductive isolation between the taxa. Reinforcement often results in a pattern of reproductive character displacement, which is defined as two species having greater reproductive isolation in sympatry then in allopatry. Floral-color divergence in the native Texas wildflower, Phlox drummondii, constitutes one of the best documented cases of <b>reinforcement</b> in <b>plants.</b> P. drummondii and a closely related species, P. cuspidata produce similar light-blue flowers throughout the allopatric parts of their ranges. However, in the area of sympatry P. drummondii has dark-red flowers, which has been shown to decrease hybridization between the two species. In the following work, I investigate the causes and consequences of the process of reinforcement and the pattern of character displacement in P. drummondii. First, I identify the genetic basis of the flower color variation as regulatory changes in two genes controlling the type and amount of anthocyanin floral pigments. I then evaluate neutral genetic variation across the range of P. drummondii and conclude there is extensive gene flow between allopatric and sympatric areas of the range, which indicates that selection and not genetic drift is responsible for the flower color variation. By investigating genetic variation at the loci underlying flower color variation I find a molecular signature of a selective sweep at one of the two flower color loci, further indicating that selection is responsible for this flower color variation. Finally, I measure selection on flower color in both sympatry and allopatry. I find no evidence that flower color variation is a response to ecological character displacement or local adaptation in the area of sympatry. I find evidence of pollinator preference for the ancestral allopatric flower color in allopatry, which may explain the persistence of the pattern of character displacement. These investigations of reproductive character displacement and reinforcement address important areas of research in evolutionary biology including the genetic basis of adaptation, the formation of species, and pleiotropy and conflicting selection pressures in species.

40|$|Dickeya dadantii {{is a broad}} {{host range}} phytopathogenic {{bacterium}} provoking soft rot disease on many plants including Arabidopsis. We showed that, after D. dadantii infection, {{the expression of the}} Arabidopsis BOS 1 gene was specifically induced by the production of the bacterial PelB/C pectinases able to degrade pectin. This prompted us to analyze the interaction between the bos 1 mutant and D. dadantii. The phenotype of the infected bos 1 mutant is complex. Indeed, maceration symptoms occurred more rapidly in the bos 1 mutant than in the wild type parent but at a later stage of infection, a necrosis developed around the inoculation site that provoked a halt in the progression of the maceration. This necrosis became systemic and spread throughout the whole plant, a phenotype reminiscent of that observed in some lesion mimic mutants. In accordance with the progression of maceration symptoms, bacterial population began to grow more rapidly in the bos 1 mutant than in the wild type plant but, when necrosis appeared in the bos 1 mutant, a reduction in bacterial population was observed. From the plant side, this complex interaction between D. dadantii and its host includes an early plant defence response that comprises reactive oxygen species (ROS) production accompanied by the <b>reinforcement</b> of the <b>plant</b> cell wall by protein cross-linking. At later timepoints, another plant defence is raised by the death of the plant cells surrounding the inoculation site. This plant cell death appears to constitute an efficient defenc...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that natural fibers, such as flax and hemp for example, have mechanical properties competitive to those of glass fibers. This makes such fibers very goodpotential reinforcement for polymer composites. However, there are certain difficulties to utilize those properties on the extent that composites based on these fibers become alsocompetitive with synthetic materials in terms of mechanical performance. One {{of the problems is}} poor adhesion between matrix and fibers, which can be improved by additionalfiber treatment or by use of more compatible polymers (for example bio-based resins). Another issue is related to the length or the fibers and their orientation. Normally natural fibers are fairly short and thus it is difficult to maintain their pre-define orientation in thecomposite. Finally, maybe one of the biggest drawbacks of natural fibers is variability of their properties: quality of fibers will differ depending on location of growth and time of harvest. Moreover, large variability of properties can be observed even within the same batch of fibers. Sometimes these disadvantages can overshadow the main advantage of these materials– they are environmentally friendlier than synthetic materials and they are sustainable. Due to these concerns, the other type of <b>reinforcement</b> with <b>plant</b> origin (and high cellulose content, similar to flax and hemp fibers) has recently caught an attention as alternativereinforcement for bio-based composites - regenerated cellulose fibers. Although these are manmade fibers, they are made out of the natural polymer directly in contrary to the fibersmade out materials with fossil origin. These fibers are continuous and it is easy to arrange them into fabrics with stable orientation and geometry. These fibers have been discovered {{for more than a century}} ago but until now they have not been seriously considered for use in high performance polymer composites. At present the main application of these fibers is within textile industry and in tire processing. The current study focuses on characterization of regenerated cellulose fibers (namely Cordenka fibers) in order to evaluate them as perspective reinforcement for bio-based polymer composites. General mechanical performance, statistical strength distribution as well as viscoelastic behaviour of the Cordenka fibers are presented. Influence of moisture andtemperature on mechanical properties is also examined. Suitability of regenerated cellulose fibers as reinforcement for bio-based polymer composites is discussed.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} method for high {{frequency}} plantlets regeneration protocol for Enicostema axillare (Lam.) Raynal ssp. littoralis (Blume) Raynal (E. axillare) without intermediate callus phase and to determine the content and correlation of phenolic compounds and their antioxidant activity of both the plants derived from nature and nodal culture by DPPH assay. Methods: The nodal explants were cultured on MS basal medium fortified with different concentration of various growth regulators such as BAP, KIN, TDZ and 2 iP (0. 5 – 2 mg/L) individually and in combinations with or without GA 3 for shoot bud induction and multiplication. Total phenol and flavonoid content was determined in both plants from nature and nodal culture and antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH assay. Results: The highest number of multiple shoot (108. 00 ± 3. 55 shoots/explants) was obtained on MS medium supplemented with BAP (2 mg/L) in combination with KIN (0. 5 mg/L) and GA 3 (2 mg/L). Rooting was optimized on half-strength MS medium supplemented with IAA (0. 5 mg/L). The rooted plantlets were transferred to paper cups containing vermiculite and hardening was successfully attained with 75 % survival. Among the four extract of methanol and water extract from both the plantlet from nature and nodal culture, the concentration of flavonoid {{was found to be}} higher in methanol extract of the plants from nature (146. 57 ± 1. 68 mg rutin/g extract) and phenol content was higher in the water extract of plant from nature (52. 53 ± 1. 67 mg GAE/g extract). The radical scavenging activity of four extracts. Methanol extract of plant grown in nature showed the highest radical scavenging activity (IC 50 = 87. 10 μg/mL) was investigated by DPPH test. Conclusion: The present study not only enables <b>reinforcement</b> of wild <b>plant</b> populations using ex situ growth of individuals, but it also helps for high scale production of plantlets. A high correlation between antioxidant capacities and their total phenolic contents indicated that flavonoid compounds were a major contributor of antioxidant activity of both plants grown from nature and nodal culture...|$|R
40|$|Amongst {{the most}} widely used {{computational}} fluid dynamics models, some include a sediment transport module that enables the examination of river channel dynamics. However, most ignore two families of processes influencing lateral erosion rates, and thus channel evolution mechanisms: lateral transport of sediment through mass wasting along river banks and valley walls, and soil <b>reinforcement</b> created by <b>plant</b> roots. A few modelling packages consider geotechnical processes, albeit with important limitations. Indeed, most solutions are solely compatible with single-threaded channels, impose a given computational mesh structure (e. g. body-fitted coordinate system), derive lateral migration rates from hydraulic properties, adjust bank morphology solely based on the angle of repose of the bank material, rely on non-physical assumptions to describe certain processes (e. g. channel cut offs in meandering rivers), and exclude floodplain processes. This paper describes the development and testing of two modules that were recently added to the mathematical suite of solvers TELEMAC-MASCARET to address the aforementioned limitations. The first module (GEOTECH) includes an algorithm that scans the computational domain in an attempt to detect potentially unstable slope profiles across the domain or intersecting with water-soil boundaries. The module relies on a fully configurable, universal genetic algorithm with tournament selection to delineate the shape of the surface along which a slump block detaches itself from a river bank or slope by translational or rotational mechanism. Both the hydrostatic pressure caused by the flow and the elevation of the water table are used in the Bishop’s method to quantify slope stability. Another algorithm computes the surface of the coarse fraction of the block material which is deposited at the toe of the slope. The second module (RIPVEG) simulates the evolution of floodplain vegetation, whose properties affect the geotechnical stability of slopes present in the computational domain by imposing a surcharge and increasing soil cohesion near the soil surface. Plants develop in height, weight and rooting depth at a rate that depends on the species and plant age. The two modules, combined with the flow and sediment transport models included in TELEMAC, provide a holistic solution to study the dynamics of a broad range of alluvial river types. The model is currently being tested, calibrated and validated using datasets from meandering rivers...|$|R

If you are the author please contact PEARL Admin (pearladmin@plymouth. ac. uk) to discuss options. Natural fibres are increasingly being considered as the reinforcement for polymer matrix composites as they {{are perceived to be}} sustainable being a renewable resource. However, they suffer from higher variability in mechanical properties and concerns about their long-term durability in a moist environment. In this study the physical properties of the jute fibres were characterised, the fibre length distribution was determined and the fibre cross-section was analysed using digital images. It was observed that the true fibre area followed a log-normal distribution. The fibre area distribution for different geometrical shapes was estimated and the error in the estimated area of assumed fibre cross-section was also determined to assess the applicability of the assumed cross-section. The mechanical properties of the jute technical fibres from a single batch from South Asia were determined; fibre tensile tests were carried out at ten different gauge lengths between 6 mm and 300 mm and the Young’s modulus, strain to failure and ultimate tensile strengths were determined individually. A strong correlation was observed between the fibre strength/fracture strain and fibre gauge length. It was found as the gauge length increases the fibre strength/fracture strain drops. The fibre failure (Strength/Strain) was modelled using Weibull distribution and three statistical models were developed to relate the fibre strength/fracture strain to the fibre gauge length. Examination of tensile test data reveals that the coefficient of variation (CoV) for failure strain is consistently lower than the CoV for fracture stress (strength), as the failure strain is weakly influenced by the fibre cross-section. Hence, failure strain is the more consistent failure criterion and it is recommended to use failure strain as the key design criterion for natural fibre composites in order to improve reliability in the design of these materials. Different authors have tried to model natural fibre reinforced polymer elastic modulus using micromechanical models and have suggested that further study should include fibre angle and length distribution factors to improve the micromechanical prediction. This thesis further seeks to validate a novel methodology for the prediction of the tensile modulus and strength of natural fibre composites through careful consideration of each of the parameters in the rule of mixtures along with consideration of the statistical variation inherent in <b>reinforcements</b> extracted from <b>plants.</b> The tensile modulus and strength of jute fibre reinforced composites manufactured from well characterised fibres was measured experimentally. Six well established micromechanical models were used to predict the composite elastic modulus. Two micromechanical models were used to predict composite strength. For both mechanical properties, the inclusion of a fibre area correction factor to account for the non-circular cross-section of the fibre resulted in an improved prediction of the respective mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|Hilly {{topography}} {{and frequent}} rainstorms result in many slope failures in Hong Kong {{which is a}} major hazard receiving much public attention. Various mitigation schemes have been implemented {{over the last few}} decades to increase the safety margins of urban cut and fill slopes. The urge to build a sustainable green society has made the conventional solution of using hard sprayed concrete cover inadequate. Greening of urban slopes using live self-generated vegetation with minimal maintenance cost thus became a favorable option and is worth to further explore in a more systematic manner. It is believed that live vegetation can upgrade a slope through hydrological and mechanical contributions. Both field and laboratory studies were undertaken in this study which covered the mechanical and hydrological aspects of vegetation. Four native species, including shrubs, Rhodomyrtus tomentosa and Melastoma sanguineum, and small trees, Schefflera heptaphylla and Reevesia thyrsoidea, were studied. About 1, 000 seedlings were planted and monitored for three years. Natural individuals of the selected native species and an exotic tree, Leucaena leucocephala, were sampled randomly for comparison. Their growth performance, root distribution and mechanical functions were compared between establishment time and types, species, plant forms and tree origins, by laboratory (tensile and direct shear tests) and field (uprooting and direct shear tests) tests. Finally, slope stability analysis was conducted on bare slopes and slopes vegetated using the selected native species. After a three-year establishment period, the growth rate of the studied species has not yet leveled off. The average maximum rooting depth (RD) of the three-year old trees exceeded 1 m. The planted samples had larger root systems than the natural ones in terms of most root attributes. The growth potential of these four species on typical man-made slopes in Hong Kong was highlighted. The anchorage ability of the plants was investigated by uprooting test. Correlation between the peak pull-out resistance (Pmax) and plant parameters gives a first-hand estimation of Pmax. Above-ground dry weight was the key indicator of Pmax for both plant forms of the native species while trees could also be well predicted by basal diameter. However, root shapes had no significant impact on Pmax. In laboratory direct shear test, reinforced samples had higher peak shear strength (Δs) at longer displacement. Root directions and root area ratio (RAR) had significant influence on Δs. Significant power relationship was found between root diameter and Δs. From field tests, no significant Δs was found between plant forms and establishment types, which indicates similar magnitude of <b>reinforcement</b> by the <b>planted</b> shrubs and naturally grown trees. Using the Wu Model, the maximum root cohesion (cr) of the studied species was found within the top 0. 4 m soil depth. The increase in the factor of safety (FOS) is remarkable in shallow soil depth determined by RD. In sunny days, the effect of suction induced by plants is reduced. With the typical approach of slope stability analysis, an unsafe slope can be turned to marginally safe by mature trees with similar reinforcement effects as shrubs in the same height class. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
