40|$|Knowledge of {{pragmatics}} {{has been}} a crucial element of language teacher training programmes. Future teachers {{should be aware of}} the pragmatic constraints of the target language to teach it to the foreign language learners. In general, language teachers intensively focus on grammar during lessons as they may lack pragmatic awareness in the target language, or they have difficulty to put into practice the pragmatic knowledge they already possess. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the pragmatic awareness of EFL teacher trainees and their use of and difficulties in practical pragmatic applications. A Discourse Completion Task (DCT) was given to 30 EFL teacher trainees to investigate their awareness of pragmatic knowledge. Also, teacher trainees wrote <b>reflection</b> <b>papers</b> about their strengths and weaknesses about pragmatics in their actual teaching process and planned and practised a specific pragmatics-focused lesson. 10 teacher trainees were interviewed to get in-depth information about the problems they faced in teaching pragmatics.

Experiential learning strategies can enhance skill development and translation of knowledge into OT clinical practice. In addition, {{skills such as}} coaching may provide important links to health promotion practices. Thirty-two occupational therapy students took part in an experiential project to connect occupational engagement and health for a community of older adults. A pretest/posttest design {{was used to evaluate}} program outcomes in student perceived abilities, and narrative <b>reflection</b> <b>papers</b> provided postexperience qualitative information. The students improved in all 10 areas of abilities selfassessment with mean total scores from pretest (M = 42) improving significantly at posttest (M = 58).

The students improved in their abilities to use coaching and health promotion strategies through the use of experiential learning methods.

The {{first quarter of this}} course spans drama from Greek drama to the Renaissance. The second quarter begins with Ibsen's A Doll's House and ends with the postmodern, including Beckett's Endgame and the work of Pinter and Caryl Churchill. For midterms and finals, students either write a paper critically analyzing a play, or else perform scenes from plays relevant to the course (though not necessarily those read in class).

40|$|Christian {{educators}} {{have a unique}} calling to equip their students to become active disciples of Jesus Christ. In 2001, the staff of Unity Christian High School was challenged to examine its teaching practices in this light. After {{a review of the}} current literature, two goals were adopted: (1) to provide greater opportunities for students to “unwrap their gifts ” and (2) to broaden the use of authentic assessment. The staff began by amending the graduation requirements of the 2002 graduating class. Second semester exams were no longer to be administered to the seniors, and students were required to make contributions to portfolios. As an alternative closure experience, seniors were required to write <b>reflection</b> <b>papers</b> and to plan and perform a presentation. The purpose was to provide an opportunity for students to reflect upon their years of Christian education, to tell their stories and to share their gifts, burdens and joys. From this “experiment”, a research question soon emerged: Which closure experience is more meaningful for Unity students: senior examinations or senior projects? Both the anecdotal evidence and the survey results indicate that the graduating class of 2002 was far more engaged in its work at Unity during the final weeks of school than the students of 2001 who completed senior examinations. The senior <b>reflection</b> <b>papers</b> resound with a positive reception of this process. Alumni survey...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the call}} for change in medical school {{curriculum}} towards a more humanistic approach, it remains {{clear that there is}} an urgent need to study the effects of personal development classes on medical students‘ skill level. Using participants from an ethical influence communications class, this study explored the impact of the use of reflection on personal awareness and professional competence skills in second and third year medical students. A total of 230 <b>reflection</b> <b>papers</b> from 46 medical students were analyzed using CAQDAS – computer assisted qualitative data analysis system [...] with Atlas ti 6. 2. Personal interviews (n= 11) followed for clarification and verification of results. Analysis showed that <b>reflection</b> <b>papers</b> proved to be an effective way to measure changes in self-development levels {{as well as some of}} the dimensions of professional competence skills required for graduating medical students. Students reported an appreciation and a strong desire for increased classes on personal awareness as well as insight into the results on communication skills of a medical curriculum based on a strictly medical model. The <b>reflection</b> <b>papers</b> allowed some students to vi ―have a voice‖ in a system, they felt, where they were not heard. Many students reported an increased awareness of viewing the patient as individuals, vs. the ―uniform patient,‖ as a result of learning about themselves. Several students suggested a need for advanced communication classes to develop the skill level they felt they needed to deal with public expectations. Interestingly, all graduating students interviewed, who applied the content of the class to the final assignment of writing an application to a residency program, were admitted into their first program of choice. Findings from this study may provide suggestions on incorporating personal and self-development classes into a medical school curriculum. Using a case study approach, this qualitative exploratory study offers an example for future researchers on insights into the use of reflection and assessing learning in medical students, how medical students perceive their educational experience, and the benefits of incorporating personal awareness experiences for the individual student.

The literature supports the contention that current models of training and supervision for multicultural competency are not completely effective due to the pluralistic changes in demographics found in many multicultural societies. By using a step-by-step descriptive process based on a modification of the Structured Group Supervision model in combination with a format based {{on the principles of}} the Native American Talking Circle, the TCS model addresses these deficiencies and shortcomings found in other models. ^ This study consists of two parts of using a multi-method research approach that combines both qualitative and quantitative procedures.
