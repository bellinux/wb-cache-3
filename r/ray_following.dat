40|$|The {{identification}} of larval forms of marine fishes, of fish fragments found in stomach contents and of fossil fish is often difficult. As {{an aid to}} such work a study is being made of the vertebral characteristics of adult marine fishes found off the coasts of Mexico, California, Oregon and Washington and a key based on these characteristics is being constructed. The possibility of such a key was suggested by Ford (1937), who described at considerable length and {{with the aid of}} some excellent photographs the differences in the vertebral columns of several teleostean fishes, approaching the subject from the "functional" angle without any attempt to form a key. Work was begun on the present study in 1938 and has been continued as material and time were available. Because of the large number of species involved it has been found necessary to divide the study into geographical units. The first unit, covered in this paper, comprises 163 species of fish, omitting the Elasmobranchii, found between Point Conception and San Diego. Work will be continued on fishes from the areas to the north and south of this region and published as completed. The material for this study consisted mainly of fresh adult specimens which were lightly boiled to loosen the flesh from the bones. To secure less common forms it became necessary to use material which had been preserved in alcohol or formaldehyde. Since no amount of boiling will loosen the flesh from the bones of preserved specimens, the clearing and staining technique described by Hollister (1934) was adopted with some modifications (see appendix). This technique was also used on the smaller fresh individuals to avoid loss of vertebrae in the boiling process. In naming the various parts of the skeleton, Starks (1901) was followed, with one exception. Starks calls the last fanlike tail segment articulated with the last true vertebral centrum, the "hypural. " Since the term "hypural" is used by many authors to designate the spines which are loosely attached to this fanlike plate and the word "urostyle" is used for the plate itself, this latter terminology was adopted. The basis for separating the abdominal and caudal vertebrae is that of Hubbs and Lagler (1947). In the fin ray counts, the last two rays were counted separately, unless they originated from the same base, in which case they were counted as one <b>ray.</b> <b>Following</b> usual procedure the spine counts are given in Roman numerals and the soft ray counts in Arabic. A comma separates the spine number from the ray number in the same fin. In the case of two dorsal fins, a hyphen separates the individual counts of the two separate fins. Finlets are given in Roman numerals following, and separated from, the ray counts by a hyphen. It is recognized that fin counts probably will not be of much use in {{identification of}} stomach contents, so every effort was made to key the fish without resort to fin counts. In a number of cases when it was impossible to do this the fin counts have been included in the key. They are also given in the descriptive text as corroborative data. Other sources have been consulted to obtain additional fin ray counts. The numbers here given include the greatest known range for each species. The form and shape of the vertebrae may undergo changes and modifications between the young and the adult forms which may create some confusion where the key is based on adults only. Such a variation has already been described for Clevelandia ios and related forms (Clothier, 1946). Furthermore, examination of additional specimens may indicate that other skeletal features change with growth and, consequently, certain characters here used may later prove of doubtful diagnostic value...|$|E
40|$|Summary of {{the results}} {{in the context of}} EDCAT 5 project aims: 1. By {{comparing}} appropriate biomarkers in fish sampled from STW-impacted sites and control sites during the pre-remediation period, to determine whether there was evidence for any effects that might be attributed to the presence of estrogenic (or androgenic, or anti-androgenic/-estrogenic) endocrine disrupting chemicals in the former. This aim was addressed by measuring concentrations of the estrogen-dependent yolk protein precursor vitellogenin, and the androgen-dependent nest glue spiggin in male and female sticklebacks. In addition histological examination of the gonadal structure of fish captured at the impacted and non-impacted sites was employed to seek evidence of overt alterations in reproductive physiology of the fish. For a subset of matched samples from the two rivers, the relative induction of hepatic choriogenin mRNA, a biomarker of estrogen exposure, was measured. Conclusions: Chemistry data provided by EDCAT 3 & 4 showed that estrogenicity of the effluent was low prior to remediation and lower still following installation of the GAC plant. No evidence of overt estrogenic effects was detected in male sticklebacks in the Ray, VTG and ChG levels were similar in males from both rivers. Nor was there any evidence of alterations in spiggin concentrations in the kidneys of males from the Ray compared to the Ock. However, VTG concentrations in female sticklebacks from the Ray were increased following the STW upgrade as were hepatic ChG transcript levels, and kidney spiggin concentrations. No changes in these elements of the reproductive system were observed in females from the Ock across the same time periods. Chemical analysis of the effluent indicated that prior to installation of the GAC plant substantial concentrations of anti-androgenic chemicals were present, together {{with a wide range of}} other organics. Concentrations of these were much reduced following the plant upgrade. It is reasonable to suppose that the changes observed in the female reproductive endocrine system following the upgrade were related to the removal of some or all of this complex mixture of chemicals. The absence of effects in males may be related to the balance between exogenous and endogenous signals, or to the specificity of effects exerted by the chemicals present. No intersex fish were detected from either river. A significant bias in favour of females was detected in the stickleback populations in both rivers suggesting a factor associated with life-history of the fish, rather than contaminant burden, was responsible. 2. By comparing appropriate biomarkers in fish sampled from STW-impacted sites and control sites during the pre-remediation period, to determine whether there was evidence for any effects that might be attributed to the presence of “conventionally” toxic chemicals. This was addressed by measurement of the activity of a key Phase I transforming enzyme in the liver of fish, either using direct enzymatic assay (EROD) or by quantifying the levels of expression of the corresponding gene (CYP 1 A). Conclusions:	EROD activity was significantly greater in fish from the Ray than the Ock in two samples collected prior to the installation of the GAC plant (2006, 2007) and this likely reflects the differential contaminant loading in the two rivers. A single sample following the commissioning of the GAC plant (2008) indicated that EROD activity had increased among fish from the Ock while that in fish from the Ray remained unchanged. While a delayed recovery of this biomarker in fish from the Ray may be expected depending on the route of exposure (direct via water or indirect via contaminated food) the reasons for elevated EROD activity in fish from the Ock/Childrey Brook are not immediately evident. Provision of a full data set for Cyp 1 A expression awaits the repeat of the assay. When this is complete the factors underlying the EROD findings may become clear. 3. To determine whether the adaptive capacity and energetic status of fish varied between the STW-impacted and non-impacted sites. This was addressed by measurement of indicators of stress (whole-body corticosteroid levels), metabolic status (whole-body glucose levels) and anabolic activity (RNA:DNA ratios). Conclusions: The data provide no evidence that the stress response of fish captured in the Ray prior to installation of the GAC plant was modified by exposure to the effluent. However, large variations in whole-body corticosteroid and glucose concentrations in fish from both rivers, with clear trends over time, were closely linked to perturbations in the river flow regime. Whether there was interaction between environmental and chemical factors in determining corticosteroid and glucose status is difficult to discern but it seems likely that variation in these indicators of the stress axis was driven primarily by environmental factors. The RNA:DNA ratios were closely linked with seasonal change in temperature and closely matched observed patterns of weight and length gain in stickleback populations in the two rivers. The longer growth period enjoyed by fish in the Ray was clearly evident. For both rivers, mean anabolic activity was greater during 2008 than 2007 and it seems likely that this is related to adverse effects associated with the periods of extreme flow change observed on both rivers in 2007. 4. To assess whether there were differences in population size and structure between STW-impacted and non-impacted sites. This was addressed by comparison of key somatic measures, in particular frequency distributions for fork length. Conclusions: Because of the extreme patchiness of the distribution of stickleback populations in both rivers accurate abundance estimates were not obtained. However, the catch per unit effort across the life of the project was similar for both rivers. While population size, and age structure (both rivers hosted annual populations), appeared to be similar fish in the Ray were overall larger than those from the Ock, and spawned earlier. The differences in growth and timing of spawning between the rivers were likely to have been associated with the Rodbourne STW effluent. Downstream of the discharge on the Ray water temperatures were consistently 2 – 3 oC above those of the Ock. This temperature difference, in combination with the introduction of additional nutrients into the river which is likely to have affected the availaibility of food, probably accounts for the different growth profile among the sticklebacks in the two rivers. However, over and above this difference, there was a significant increase in size of sticklebacks in the Ray between the matched pre- and post-remediation periods in the Ray while no change in size of the fish in the Ock occurred during the same period. Similarly, the RNA:DNA ratio was higher in fish from the Ock during 2007 but greater in fish from the Ray during 2008. Taken together, these observations suggest that there was an improvement in the status of the fish in the <b>Ray</b> <b>following</b> the commissioning of the GAC plant, while the population in the Ock remained relatively stable. It is reasonable to suppose that this may be linked to the reduction of the chemical load entering the Ray at Rodbourne following the installation of the GAC plant. The Ray is “cleaner” now than was the case prior to remediation but remains nutrient rich and several degrees warmer than the Ock, this combination of factors providing fish in the Ray with greater scope for growth relative to populations in the Ock. ...|$|E

40|$|Resonant photonuclear isotope {{detection}} (RPID) is a nondestructive detection/assay {{of nuclear}} isotopes by measuring gamma <b>rays</b> <b>following</b> photonuclear reaction products. Medium-energy wideband photons of 12 - 16 MeV {{are used for}} the photonuclear reactions and gamma rays characteristic of the reaction products are measured by means of high-sensitivity Ge detectors. Impurities of stable and radioactive isotopes of the orders of micro-nano gr and ppm-ppb are investigated. RPID is used to study nuclear isotopes of astronuclear and particle physics interests and those of geological and historical interests. It is used to identify radioactive isotopes of fission products as well. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the neutron-rich bismuth isotope 217 Bi has been studied for the first time. The fragmentation of a primary 238 U 2 beam at the FRS-RISING setup at GSI was exploited to perform γ -decay spectroscopy, since μs isomeric states were expected in this nucleus. Gamma <b>rays</b> <b>following</b> the decay of a t 1 / 2 = 3 μs isomer were observed, allowing one to establish the low-lying {{structure of}} 217 Bi. The level energies and the reduced electric quadrupole transition probability B(E 2) from the isomeric state are compared to large-scale shell-model calculations...|$|R
