50|$|In the March 1979 {{report in}} Neurology, Drs. Susac, Hardman and Selhorst {{reported}} two {{patients with the}} triad of encephalopathy, hearing loss and microangiopathy of the retina. The first patient underwent brain biopsy, which revealed sclerosis {{of the media and}} adventitia of small pial and cortical vessels, suggestive of a healed angiitis. Both patients underwent fluorescein <b>retinal</b> <b>angiography</b> that demonstrated multifocal retinal artery occlusions without evidence of embolic disease. Though the exact pathogenesis of this disorder is unknown, the retinal and brain biopsy findings suggest a small vessel vasculopathy leading to arteriolar occlusion and microinfarction of cerebral, retinal and cochlear tissue. Demyelination is not a typical feature of Susac's syndrome. Muscle biopsies from such patients are usually normal, but some have also shown nonspecific signs of inflammation such as dense hyaline material surrounding endomysial capillaries. This suggests a possible systemic component of this disease, despite the predominance of central nervous system features. The latest thinking is that an antibody directed against endothelial cells is the pathogenic mechanism in this disease which causes the microscopic strokes in the brain, retina, and inner ear.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Retinal</b> <b>angiography</b> {{has become}} a widely used {{diagnostic}} tool. It requires the intravenous administration of the fluorescent dyes fluorescein and indocyanin green. We recently received blood taken 8 h after <b>retinal</b> <b>angiography,</b> without our knowing it. We describe the failure of an automated flow cytometry system in the enumeration of lymphocyte subpopulations in this sample. METHODS: Cell enumeration was achieved {{by the use of}} the lyse-no wash MultiTEST procedure (Becton-Dickinson) together with the FACSCalibur cytometer. Absolute cell counts were obtained using TruCount beads. Data were analyzed automatically by the MultiSET and manually with the CellQuest softwares. RESULTS: The dot plots obtained with this sample looked quite abnormal. All monuclear cells stained brightly in the FITC channel irrespective of anti-CD 3 -FITC conjugate binding. This resulted in a major undercompensation for the increased spillover of the fluorescein emission into the PE-channel. PE-labeled cell and TruCount bead events coalesced. The MultiSET software failed to draw proper gatings and proved useless. Alternative manual gatings could partially rescue the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and cytometrists should be aware that, because of dye entry or binding, blood mononuclear cells collected shortly after <b>retinal</b> <b>angiography</b> are not suitable even for common cytometry applications...|$|E
40|$|In all of 100 {{consecutive}} patients {{referred for}} <b>retinal</b> <b>angiography</b> with a clinical diagnosis of probable or possible papilloedema a definite diagnosis {{was made from}} neurological assessment, neuroradiological investigations, and follow-up. The cases have been divided into 2 groups [...] those with proved papilloedema and those which have been called either normal or pseudopapilloedema. In all cases the retinal angiograms showed normal or increased optic disc vascularity and normal or increased early and late disc fluorescence. On {{the basis of these}} alone clear differences could be shown between the groups. All cases with papilloedema showed a combination of either excess late fluorescence with excess early fluorescence or excess late fluorescence with excess disc vascularity. Only 2 cases of pseudopapilloedema (both with optic disc drusen) showed this combination, and in both the pattern of disc fluorescence was different from that seen in papilloedema. <b>Retinal</b> <b>angiography</b> therefore seems to be of considerable value in differentiating true from pseudopapilloedema, though this is possible only when each stage of the angiogram is carefully studied...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved version of our specific methodology {{to detect the}} vessel tree in <b>retinal</b> <b>angiographies.</b> The automatic analysis of retinal vessel tree facilitates the computation of the arteriovenous index, which {{is essential for the}} diagnosis several eye diseases. The developed system is inspired in the classical snake but incorporating domain specific knowledge, such as blood vessels topological properties. It profits from the automatic localization of the optic disc, the vessel creases extraction and, as a recent innovation, the morphological vessel segmentation, all developed in our research group. After researching and testing our system, the parameter configuration has been enhanced. Significantly better results in the detection of arteriovenous structures are obtained, keeping a high efficiency, as shown by the systems performance evaluation on the publicly available DRIVE database. 1...|$|R

We report {{a cohort of}} patients with microcystic macular edema. Patients and Methods: All patients with optic neuropathy and microcystic macular edema were enrolled. Demographics, visual function, <b>retinal</b> <b>angiographies</b> and OCT parameters were studied. Results: Nineteen patients (23 eyes) exhibited microcystic macular edema: 10 men/ 9 women, aged 17 - 91 years. Etiologies of optic nerve atrophy were compressive (5), inflammatory (4), glaucoma (3), ischemic (3), trauma (2), degenerative (1), and hereditary (1). Median visual acuity was 4 / 10 (NLP- 12 / 10). Fluorescein angiography showed no leakage. Topography of the microcystic macular edema correlated with near infrared images but with visual field defects in only 26  %. OCT parameters were all abnormal. Conclusions: Microcystic macular edema is a non-specific manifestation from an optic neuropathy of any etiology. The precise mechanism leading to microcystic macular edema remains unknown but trans-synaptic retrograde degeneration with Müller cells dysfunction is likely...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Takayasu {{arteritis}} (TA) is a chronic, granulomatous, idiopathic, {{inflammatory disease}} that primarily affects large vessels. {{the objective of}} this study was to evaluate and describe the ocular manifestations of TA, correlating the resistivity and pressure in retrobulbar vessels by colour Doppler and <b>retinal</b> <b>angiography.</b> Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: Twenty-one patients with TA, 42 eyes, and 21 patients without TA (42 eyes) as control subjects. Methods: This study was performed in clinical practice. Patients with TA received complete ophthalmologic examination, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, and colour Doppler ultrasound to evaluate blood flow in the retrobulbar vessels. Results: A statistical correlation was found between peak systolic velocity (PSV) in the ophthalmic artery (OA) and Heidelberg <b>retinal</b> <b>angiography</b> (HRA) examination results (p = 0. 006), and resistivity index (RI) in the OA was abnormal in patients with long (average, 14 years) versus short (average, 5. 5 years) onset time of the disease (p = 0. 035). RI in the central retinal artery (CRA) was abnormal in patients with a long time of disease onset (mean 14. 4 years) versus those with a short time (mean 4. 6 years) of onset (p = 0. 006). Conclusions: the longer the onset of the disease, the more commonly the RI showed changes in the OA and CRA, and, to a lesser extent, in the short posterior ciliary artery. When abnormalities are observed in the HRA examination, abnormal PSV in the OA may be present. Doppler blood flow evaluation and HRA may have predictive value in all patients with TA as part of serial monitoring.

40|$|Susac {{syndrome}} is an uncommon autoimmune microangiopathy {{characterized by a}} combination of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAO), and hearing loss. In this report, we present a detailed history of a 31 -year-old man with Susac syndrome with thrombophilia.

In <b>retinal</b> <b>angiography,</b> segmentation of drusen, a yel-lowish deposit located on the retina, is a serious challenge in proper diagnosis and prevention of further complications. Drusen extraction using classic segmentation methods {{does not lead to}} good results. We present a new segmentation method based on new transformations we introduced in mathematical morphology. It is based on the search for a new class of regional maxima components of the image. These maxima correspond to the regions inside the drusen. We present experimental results for drusen extraction using images containing examples having different types and shapes of drusen. We also apply our segmentation technique to two important cases of dynamic sequences of drusen images. The first case is for tracking the average gray level of a particular drusen in a sequence of angiographic images during a fluorescein exam.

40|$|Copyright © 2000 by Academic PressSodium {{fluorescein}} (NaF) {{has been}} widely used as a contrast dye in clinical practice for {{the investigation of the}} chorioretinal microcirculation. Several of its derivatives are also used in fluorescence techniques for microcirculatory research. NaF circulates in blood largely associated with plasma proteins (namely albumin), and, to a shorter extent, with the erythrocyte membrane (Delori et al., 1978). Its presence in circulation has been linked to the occurrence of detrimental effects in blood homeostasis. Jung et al. (1995) reported that NaF angiography decreases microvascular blood flow, as measured by prolongation of retinal circulation time. NaF injection for <b>retinal</b> <b>angiography</b> induces an increase of circulating histamine (Arroyave et al., 1979), suggesting a proinflammatory effect of NaF. Also, an association between in vitro labeling of leukocytes with fluorescein derivatives and modification of their functional properties has been demonstrated (DeClerck et al., 1994), and in other experimental settings fluorescein isothiocyanate is used in vitro as a hapten to elicit nonspecific stimulation of lymphocyte subsets (Hughes et al., 1995).

40|$|Leakage in <b>retinal</b> <b>angiography</b> {{currently}} {{is a key}} feature for confirming the activities of lesions {{in the management of}} a wide range of retinal diseases, such as diabetic maculopathy and paediatric malarial retinopathy. This paper proposes a new saliency-based method for the detection of leakage in fluorescein angiography. A superpixel approach is firstly employed to divide the image into meaningful patches (or superpixels) at different levels. Two saliency cues, intensity and compactness, are then proposed for the estimation of the saliency map of each individual superpixel at each level. The saliency maps at different levels over the same cues are fused using an averaging operator. The two saliency maps over different cues are fused using a pixel-wise multiplication operator. Leaking regions are finally detected by thresholding the saliency map followed by a graph-cut segmentation. The proposed method has been validated using the only two publicly available datasets: one for malarial retinopathy and the other for diabetic retinopathy.

40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND: Iris {{fluorescein}} angiography (IFA) is not {{commonly used}} in clinical practice, although its value has been demonstrated especially in cases of diabetic disease. IFA is able to show neovascular tufts in order to guide the laser treatment, and it is highly recommended in diabetic patients who need cataract surgery or vitrectomy. Nevertheless, IFA fails to demonstrate the iris vascular pattern in heavily pigmented iris and conspicuous leakage cases. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the feasibility of iris indocyanine green videoangiography (IICGV) and to correlate its findings with those of IFA in diabetic iridopathy. METHODS: Thirty six patients affected in varying degrees by diabetic retinopathy underwent an ophthalmic examination including <b>retinal</b> fluorescein <b>angiography,</b> IFA, and IICGV. IICGV was performed using IMAGEnet System H 1024. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that IICGV allows precise visualisation of the iris vascular pattern, also in cases of heavily pigmented iris. CONCLUSIONS: Three main findings seemed to be evident: firstly, iris neovascularisations are detected with IFA far more easily than IICGV; secondly, capillary dilatations and iris hypoperfusion are identified far more clearly using IICGV; thirdly, there is no evident relation between capillary dilatation or iris hypoperfusion, and degree of diabetic retinopathy...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Susac {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} disease of unknown pathogenesis. It {{is caused by a}} microangiopathy affecting the arterioles of the brain, retina, and cochlea, giving the classic clinical triad of subacute encephalopathy, visual loss secondary to retinal branch occlusions, and sensori-neural hearing loss.

40|$|Objective—To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} endogenous apelin in pathological retinal angiogenesis. Methods and Results—The progression of ischemic retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, is closely associated with pathological retinal angiogenesis, mainly induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin. Although antiangiogenic therapies using anti-VEGF drugs are effective in treating retinal neovascularization, they show a transient efficacy and cause general adverse effects. New therapeutic target molecules are needed to resolve these issues. It was recently demonstrated that the apelin/APJ system, a newly deorphanized G protein–coupled receptor system, is involved in physiological retinal vascularization. <b>Retinal</b> <b>angiography</b> and mRNA expression were examined during hypoxia-induced retinal angiogenesis in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. Compared with age-matched control mice, retinal apelin expression was dramatically increased during the hypoxic phase in oxygen-induced retinopathy model mice. APJ was colocalized in proliferative cells, which were probably endothelial cells of the ectopic vessels in the vitreous body. Apelin deficiency hardly induced hypoxia-induced retinal angiogenesis despite the upregulation of VEGF and erythropoietin mRNA in oxygen-induced retinopathy model mice. Apelin small and interfering RNA suppressed the proliferation of endothelial cells independent of the VEGF/VEGF receptor 2 signaling pathway. Conclusion—These results suggest that apelin is a prerequisite factor for hypoxia-induced retinal angiogenesis. (Arterioscle...|$|E

His past medical history is remarkable for a congenital cardiac disease. He presented with vision of light perception in the right eye and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Fundus findings included a macular cherry-red spot and inferior hemiretinal whitening consistent with hemiretinal artery occlusion. Laboratory testing showed increased red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. The patient was treated with four phlebotomies with improvement of RBC count and after one month reperfusion of the retina and a visual acuity of 20 / 200 were observed. Thrombophilia and cardiac screening were negative, except for secondary polycythemia. Conclusion. Hemiretinal artery occlusion is extremely rare in children and {{is often associated with}} congenital cardiac disease and hypercoagulative states...|$|R
40|$|A {{characteristic}} fundus {{picture was}} consistently produced following acute bilateral common carotid artery ligation in mature rats, reminiscent of human carotid occlusive disease. Two days after ligation {{it consisted of}} dilatation and tortuosity of retinal veins, blurring and swelling of the optic disc, retinal whitening primarily along the venous distribution, and straightening of <b>retinal</b> arteries. Fluorescein <b>angiography</b> showed hyperfluorescence of the disc, delay {{in the rate of}} retinal arterial and venous filling, venous dilatation, disc oedema, disruption of the retinal capillary bed pattern, and late peripapillary staining/leakage. This pattern was not seen in rats which underwent acute unilateral ligation, although some mild changes were seen on fluorescein angiography. The vascular alterations seemed to regress spontaneously within one week. A peripapillary 'halo' and a granular-appearing nerve fibre layer developed later, exclusively in bilaterally ligated animals...|$|R
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study of the}} peripheral retinal vasculature in a Jamaican cohort of subjects with sickle cell disease has been in progress {{over a period of}} 12 years using fluorescein angiography. Various vascular patterns were identified but their significance was unclear since no comparable records were available in subjects of a similar age with normal (AA) haemoglobin genotype. Fluorescein <b>retinal</b> angioscopy and <b>angiography</b> have been performed in 76 haemoglobin AA controls participating in the cohort study. The peripheral retinal capillary bed could be seen and photographed in a limited portion of the temporal peripheral fundus in a majority of this group, and there was considerable variation in the vascular pattern which could be characterised. These observations allow deviations from normal to be identified in the retinal vasculature in subjects with sickle cell disease...|$|R
