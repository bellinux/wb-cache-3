50|$|A {{ball bearing}} {{is a type}} of <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing</b> that uses balls to {{maintain}} the separation between the bearing races.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rolling-element</b> <b>bearing,</b> {{in which}} rolling {{elements}} placed between the turning and stationary races prevent sliding friction. There {{are two main}} types ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> do {{not handle}} {{contamination}} well and require seals.|$|R
5000|$|Plain {{bearings}} generally {{handle a}} wider temperature range than <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Fluid {{bearings}} {{are typically}} quieter and smoother (more consistent friction) than <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings.</b> For example, hard disks manufactured with fluid bearings have noise ratings for bearings/motors {{on the order}} of 20-24 dB, which is a little more than the background noise of a quiet room. Drives based on <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> are typically at least 4 dB noisier.|$|R
50|$|The rolling-elements of a <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing</b> ride on races. The large {{race that}} goes into a bore is called the outer race, and the small race that the shaft rides in is called the inner race.|$|E
5000|$|In normal operation, a <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing</b> has the rollers {{and races}} {{separated}} by {{a thin layer of}} lubricant such as grease or oil. [...] Although these lubricants normally appear liquid (not solid), under high pressure they act as solids and keep the bearing and race from touching.|$|E
50|$|A <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing,</b> {{also known}} as a rolling bearing, is a bearing which carries a load by placing rolling {{elements}} (such as balls or rollers) between two bearing rings called races. The relative motion of the races causes the rolling elements to roll with very little rolling resistance and with little sliding.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> are {{manufactured}} in two forms: ball bearing slides and roller slides.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> {{can only}} run on {{hardened}} steel or stainless steel shafting (raceways).|$|R
40|$|The {{familiar}} precision <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> of {{the twentieth}} century are products of exacting technology and sophisticated science. Their very effectiveness and basic simplicity of form may discourage further interest in their history and development. Yet the full story covers a large portion of recorded history and surprising evidence of an early recognition of the advantages of rolling motion over sliding action and progress toward the development of <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings.</b> The development of <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> is followed from the earliest civilizations {{to the end of the}} eighteenth century. The influence of general technological developments, particularly those concerned with the movement of large building blocks, road transportation, instruments, water-raising equipment, and windmills are discussed, together with the emergence of studies of the nature of rolling friction and the impact of economic factors. By 1800 the essential features of ball and <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> had emerged and it only remained for precision manufacture and mass production to confirm the value of these fascinating machine elements...|$|R
5000|$|A {{slewing bearing}} or slewing ring is a {{rotational}} <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing</b> or plain bearing that typically supports a heavy but slow-turning or slow-oscillating load, often a horizontal platform {{such as a}} conventional crane, a swing yarder, or the wind-facing platform of a horizontal-axis windmill. (To [...] "slew" [...] means to turn without change of place.) ...|$|E
50|$|Fluid {{bearings}} can {{be relatively}} cheap {{compared to other}} bearings with a similar load rating. The bearing {{can be as simple}} as two smooth surfaces with seals to keep in the working fluid. In contrast, a conventional <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing</b> may require many high-precision rollers with complicated shapes. Hydrostatic and many gas bearings do have the complication and expense of external pumps.|$|E
50|$|The {{input shaft}} is mounted {{eccentrically}} to a <b>Rolling-element</b> <b>bearing</b> (typically a cylindrical roller bearing), causing the cycloidal disc {{to move in}} a circle. The cycloidal disc will independently rotate around the bearing as it is pushed against the ring gear. This is similar to planetary gears, and the direction of rotation is opposite {{to that of the}} input shaft.|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{method to}} estimate {{the life of the}} <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> uses the basic life equation: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> {{have the}} {{advantage}} of a good tradeoff between cost, size, weight, carrying capacity, durability, accuracy, friction, and so on.Other bearing designs are often better on one specific attribute, but worse in most other attributes, although fluid bearings can sometimes simultaneously outperform on carrying capacity, durability, accuracy, friction, rotation rate and sometimes cost. Only plain bearings are used as widely as <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings.</b>|$|R
50|$|In many applications, <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings,</b> such as ball or roller bearings, have {{replaced}} Babbitt bearings. Though such bearings {{can offer a}} lower coefficient of friction than plain bearings, their key advantage {{is that they can}} operate reliably without a continuous pressurized supply of lubricant. Ball and roller bearings can also be used in configurations that are required to carry both radial and axial thrusts. However, <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> lack the beneficial damping and shock-load capability provided by fluid-film bearings, such as the Babbitt.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} 30.25 m wide, 705 m long {{and has a}} bridge surface of 21,326 mÂ². The largest height over ground is 60 m. It {{consists}} completely of a steelwork construction, whose <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing</b> rests on concrete pillars. In contrast to similar bridges, the roadways of both driving directions are carried by continuous elements. The construction of the bridge was finished in 1971.|$|E
50|$|A <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing</b> is {{generally}} {{composed of a}} sleeve-like outer ring and several rows of balls retained by cages. The cages were originally machined from solid metal and were quickly replaced by stampings. It features smooth motion, low friction, high rigidity and long life. They are economical, and easy to maintain and replace. Thomson (currently owned by Danaher) {{is generally}} given credit for first producing {{is now known as}} a linear ball bearing.|$|E
50|$|A {{spherical roller}} thrust bearing is a <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing</b> of thrust type that permits {{rotation}} with low friction, and permits angular misalignment. The bearing is designed to take radial loads, and heavy axial loads in one direction. Typically these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore of the shaft washer that may be misaligned in respect to the housing washer. The misalignment is possible due to the spherical internal shape of the house washer.|$|E
50|$|Thrust {{bearings}} and journal bearings are {{a critical part}} of design. They are hydrodynamic oil <b>bearings</b> or oil-cooled <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings.</b> Foil bearings are used in some small machines such as micro turbines and also have strong potential for use in small gas turbines/auxiliary power units.|$|R
50|$|Typical <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> {{range in}} size from 10 mm {{diameter}} to a few metres diameter, and have load-carrying capacity from a few tens of grams to many thousands of tonnes.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings,</b> they do {{not require}} lubrication. Consequentially, they can be employed in environments hostile to lubricants: underwater, in a vacuum (where grease will boil) and at elevated temperatures.|$|R
50|$|A {{gear bearing}} {{is a type}} of <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing</b> similar to an {{epicyclic}} gear. Gear bearings consist of a number of smaller 'satellite' gears which revolve around the center of the bearing along a track on the outsides of the internal and satellite gears, and {{on the inside of the}} external gear. Each gear is in between two concentric rings. Therefore, the widths of the satellite gears must all be the same.|$|E
50|$|A wire race bearing is a <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing,</b> {{where the}} balls or rollers run on races {{resembling}} loops of wire. Roller bearings may use just two races, but ball bearings typically use {{three or four}} races. Wire race bearings can be large yet lightweight and with small profile and good precision. Wire races have little intrinsic structure and must be adequately supported by the bearing housing. Balls, rollers or even cross rollers are used as rolling elements. Due to the design wire race bearings are commonly called '4-point-contact' bearings.|$|E
50|$|Interpreting the {{vibration}} signal obtained is an elaborate procedure that requires specialized training and experience. It is simplified {{by the use}} of state-of-the-art technologies that provide the vast majority of data analysis automatically and provide information instead of raw data. One commonly employed technique is to examine the individual frequencies present in the signal. These frequencies correspond to certain mechanical components (for example, the various pieces that make up a <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing)</b> or certain malfunctions (such as shaft unbalance or misalignment). By examining these frequencies and their harmonics, the CM specialist can often identify the location and type of problem, and sometimes the root cause as well. For example, high vibration at the frequency corresponding to the speed of rotation is most often due to residual imbalance and is corrected by balancing the machine. A degrading <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing,</b> on the other hand, will usually exhibit vibration signals at specific frequencies increasing in intensity as it wears. Special analysis instruments can detect this wear weeks or even months before failure, giving ample warning to schedule replacement before a failure which could cause a much longer down-time. Beside all sensors and data analysis {{it is important to keep}} in mind that more than 80% of all complex mechanical equipment fail accidentally and without any relation to their life-cycle period.|$|E
40|$|Lubricant {{considerations}} for <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> have {{within the last}} two decades taken on added importance in the design and operation of mechanical systems. The phenomenon which limits the useful life of <b>bearings</b> is <b>rolling-element</b> or surface pitting fatigue. The elastohydrodynamic (EHD) film thickness which separates the ball or roller surface from those of the raceways of the bearing directly affects bearing life. Chemical additives added to the lubricant can also significantly affect bearings life and reliability. The interaction of these physical and chemical effects is important to the design engineer and user of these systems. Design methods and lubricant selection for <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> are presented and discussed...|$|R
50|$|Roller bearing {{crankshafts}} were favoured {{in central}} Europe: Germany, Switzerland and Czechoslovakia, {{owing to the}} local development and predominance of <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings,</b> {{in contrast to the}} improved metallurgy being developed for plain bearing materials in the English-speaking world.|$|R
5000|$|Plain {{bearings}} {{are very}} similar in design to <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings,</b> except they slide {{without the use of}} ball bearings. If they are cylindrical in shape, they are often called bushings. Bushings can be metal or plastic, or even air.|$|R
50|$|A {{spherical roller}} bearing is a <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing</b> that permits {{rotation}} with low friction, and permits angular misalignment. Typically these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore of the inner ring that may be misaligned in respect to the outer ring. The misalignment is possible due to the spherical internal shape {{of the outer ring}} and spherical rollers.Despite what their name may imply, {{spherical roller bearing}}s are not truly spherical in shape. The rolling elements of spherical roller bearings are mainly cylindrical in shape, but have a profile that makes them appear like cylinders that have been slightly over-inflated.|$|E
50|$|Rolling-element {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used in the industries today, and hence maintenance of these bearings becomes an important task for the maintenance professionals. The rolling-element bearings wear out easily due to metal-to-metal contact, which creates faults in the outer race, inner race and ball. It {{is also the most}} vulnerable component of a machine because it is often under high load and high running speed conditions. Regular diagnostics of <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing</b> faults is critical for industrial safety and operations of the machines along with reducing the maintenance costs or avoiding shutdown time. Among the outer race, inner race and ball, the outer race tends to be more vulnerable to faults and defects.|$|E
50|$|A {{particularly}} common kind of <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearing</b> is {{the ball}} bearing. The bearing has {{inner and outer}} races between which balls roll. Each race features a groove usually shaped so the ball fits slightly loose. Thus, in principle, the ball contacts each race across a very narrow area. However, a load on an infinitely small point would cause infinitely high contact pressure. In practice, the ball deforms (flattens) slightly where it contacts each race much as a tire flattens where it contacts the road. The race also yields slightly where each ball presses against it. Thus, the contact between ball and race is of finite size and has finite pressure. Note also that the deformed ball and race do not roll entirely smoothly because {{different parts of the}} ball are moving at different speeds as it rolls. Thus, there are opposing forces and sliding motions at each ball/race contact. Overall, these cause bearing drag.|$|E
50|$|Ball {{bearings}} tend to {{have lower}} load capacity for their size than other kinds of <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> due to the smaller contact area between the balls and races. However, they can tolerate some misalignment of {{the inner and outer}} races.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> feature cages. The cages reduce friction, wear, and bind by {{preventing}} the elements from rubbing against each other. Caged roller bearings were invented by John Harrison in the mid-18th century {{as part of}} his work on chronometers.|$|R
50|$|The first {{plain and}} <b>rolling-element</b> <b>bearings</b> were wood closely {{followed}} by bronze. Over their history bearings {{have been made}} of many materials including ceramic, sapphire, glass, steel, bronze, other metals and plastic (e.g., nylon, polyoxymethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, and UHMWPE) which are all used today.|$|R
