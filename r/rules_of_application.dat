Garett died on duty after an individual lured him with a false 9-1-1 call and then cut his throat; however, Garett, as he was dying, shot and disabled the assailant, thereby preventing other planned attacks. But, because Garett's nominator waited until the trial for the constable's murderer was concluded, the application arrived at Rideau Hall eight months past the stipulated two-year deadline.

Background. We {{consider}} the essentially infinite-dimensional elliptic operator (of the Laplace?L?v? type) (Lu) (x) = j(u??(x)) / 2, proposed by Yu. V. Bogdansky (1977), for functions on the infinite-dimensional sepa?rable real Hilbert space H. This operator doesn?t have finite-dimensional analogues. It possesses the Leibniz property and vanishes on the cylindrical functions, being the second-order differential operator. The differentiation {{rules of the}} composite function f(x,u?(x), [...] .,um(x)) for the Laplace?L?v? operator and its modifications were obtained by P. L?v?, E. M. Polishchuk, G. E. Shilov, I. Ya. Dorfman and V. Ya. Sikiryavyi. The different rule was obtained by Yu. V. Bogdansky and Ya. Yu. Sanzharevsky for the Laplacian {{with respect to a}} measure in case of Gaussian measure. Objective. The objective is to obtain the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> the essentially infinite-dimensional elliptic operator to composite functions f(x,u(x)) and f(x,u?(x), [...] .,um(x)). Methods. We use the semigroup theory techniques and the generalized Stone?Weierstrass theorem. Results. We prove the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> the essentially infinite-dimensional elliptic operator to composite functions f(x,u(x)) and f(x,u?(x), [...] .,um(x)). We also prove the similar rule for the essentially infinite-dimensional elliptic operator in bounded L-convex domains in the space H. Conclusions. The results obtained in the paper generalize the known results for the Laplace?L?v? operator and its modifications. They are also similar to the classical differentiation of the composite function. The results can be used in further investigations of essentially infinite-dimensional equations. ????????????. ??? ??????? ?? ???????????????? ????????????? ???????????? ???????????? ????????????

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{decentralization}} process of public spending in Spain, {{which has been}} one of the main landmarks in recent years, and not only in Spain but also in many different countries.
