The advantages of Israel for health tourism include good natural resources; stable, comfortable climate all year round; a progressive medical systems, and scenic locations which have a calming effect on patients. Medical tourists choose Israel for several reasons. Some come from European nations such as Romania where certain procedures are not available. Others come to Israel, most commonly from the United States, because they can <b>receive</b> <b>quality</b> health care {{at a fraction of}} the cost it would be at home, for both surgeries and in-vitro fertilization treatments. Other medical tourists come to Israel to visit the Dead Sea, a world-famous therapeutic resort. The Israel Ministry of Tourism and several professional medical services providers have set out to generate awareness of Israel's medical capabilities.|$|E

The simulation results demonstrate that our approach can provide higher average <b>received</b> <b>quality</b> and has acceptable data delivery delay when compared with a single tree method. We also show that, over a static overlay, the push-based data delivery on mesh can provide the <b>received</b> <b>quality</b> close to pull-based data delivery method with less latency. As well, it has lower control overhead than pull-based method when the peer number is large. 1...|$|R
