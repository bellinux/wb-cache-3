This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the viability of autogenous bone grafts, harvested using different methods, {{in order to determine the}} best harvesting technique with respect to more viable cells. Methods. In this animal experimental study, three harvesting methods, including manual instrument (chisel), <b>rotary</b> <b>device</b> and piezosurgery, were used for harvesting bone grafts from the lateral body of the mandible on the left and right sides of 10 rabbits. In each group, 20 bone samples were collected and their viability was assessed using MTS kit.

One-way ANOVA showed significant differences between all the groups (P= 0. 000). Data analysis using post hoc Tukey tests indicated that manual instrument and piezosurgery had no significant differences with regard to cell viability (P= 0. 749) and the cell viability in both groups was higher than that with the use of a rotary instrument (P= 0. 000).

40|$|Among various {{methods for}} drying {{pharmaceutical}} granules in the pharmaceutical industry, fluidized bed drying {{is commonly used}} due to its high rate of moisture removal, excellent performance in solids mixing, and heat and mass transfer. As pharmaceutical powders are typically organic materials with high resistivity, they can easily be charged due to repeated collision and separation of particles, along with particle-wall friction, in a fluidized bed dryer. This phenomenon, called “tribocharging”, could adversely affect the process performance. Effects of drying air temperature and drying air velocity on drying performance as well as electrostatic charge generation during the drying process were investigated in this project. In order to elucidate the effect of moisture content (ranging from approximately 30 wt. % to 1. 8 wt. %) on tribocharging behaviour, the specific charge of granules was measured in a <b>rotary</b> <b>device</b> and apparent volume resistivity was investigated in a self-designed resistivity testing cell. Limited drying data was available in the literature for drying pharmaceutical granules. Therefore, experimental work also was conducted to investigate drying kinetics under different operating conditions of relevance to industry processes. Experimental results showed that decreasing the drying air temperature increased the drying time, as expected. The specific charge of pharmaceutical granules {{was found to be}} a function of moisture content and drying air velocity rather than drying air temperature. With a decrease in moisture content, the specific charge of pharmaceutical granules increased. There was a sudden increase in measured specific charge when the moisture content decreased to approximately 5 wt. %. The same behaviour was observed in tribocharging experiments conducted in the <b>rotary</b> <b>device.</b> It also was revealed that the increase in specific charge could be due to an increase in apparent volume resistivity of granules at reduced moisture. Drying data also indicated that the effective diffusion coefficient could be correlated satisfactorily to drying temperature by the typical Arrhenius equation...|$|E

Secondary task performance and subjective mental workload were measured. Additionally, the participants were interviewed. It was found that some haptic support improved performance. However, when more haptic information was used, the results diverged in terms of task completion time and interface comprehension.

40|$|Humans use {{all their}} senses when they explore and {{interact}} with the environment. In human-machine interaction (HMI) vision is the dominant sense, followed by audition. Haptic information - information concerning the sense of touch - is not commonly available. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate how haptic feedback affects visual-manual HMI. In the experiment presented in paper I the spatial haptic properties shape and location were compared. Shape encoding often relies on users sequentially exploring differently shaped knobs, levers or buttons. The experiment revealed that physical shapes available through a shape-changing device can be as efficient as adjacently located push-buttons to encode functions in an interface. The experiment presented in paper II investigated {{the extent to which}} interface information can be transferred between the haptic and visual modalities. The feedback - rendered textures - was displayed haptically through a <b>rotary</b> <b>device</b> and visually through a computer monitor. There was a cross-modal transfer between the modalities, although not effortless, and the transfer from haptics to vision seemed to be easier than the transfer from vision to haptics. The asymmetry of the cross-modal transfer and the enhanced visual performance might be a result of the visual information being more useful for the task at hand. Paper III presents an experiment carried out in a car simulator. The experiment was conducted to investigate how haptic feedback in an in-car interface affects driver behaviour. Visual feedback was provided on a screen at the centre panel of the simulator. Haptic feedback was provided through the interaction device - a <b>rotary</b> <b>device.</b> The results revealed that, although driving performance degradation did not differ between the different haptic and visual feedback conditions, all conditions caused a degradation in driving performance. Visual behaviour did not differ between conditions including visual feedback. It is therefore apparent that the haptic feedback was not actively used when visual interface information was provided. Using haptic feedback only was shown to be more time-consuming. In addition it was revealed that tasks with only haptic feedback induce a cognitive load on the driver. It was apparent in studies II and III that the haptic information is not actively used if the visual information is more easily achieved. Godkänd; 2007; 20070919 (biem...|$|E

40|$|In-vehicle driving {{interfaces}} {{have become}} increasingly complex with added secondary task functions designed to make driving enjoyable and comfortable. A single display solution in combination with a haptic <b>rotary</b> <b>device</b> {{has the potential to}} reduce the clutter of buttons. With well-designed haptic information (i. e., cues that could be explored by touch), drivers should be able to find and select functions without taking their eyes off the road. However, when this thesis work started, few studies focused on the effects of adding haptic information to secondary tasks in cars. Clearly, research is needed that examines how adding more information to secondary tasks supports or distracts drivers. This thesis investigates haptic perception, attention, and effects on secondary tasks and driving performance for an interaction menu selection interface controlled by an in-vehicle haptic <b>rotary</b> <b>device.</b> The research questions addressed how and why performance would be affected by added haptic information. The causes of selective attention in a visual and haptic menu selection task were also investigated. Three experimental studies complemented with interviews and questionnaires were performed. Two of the studies included a simulated driving task. It could be concluded that an addition of haptic information to a visual menu selection interface could increase secondary task performance and were preferred with respect to usability issues. However, more complex haptic additions could also confuse the driver. This result depends on the context and differed between persons. From a driving performance perspective, both visual and cognitive demand affected the driving, but differently. These effects were less pronounced when both visual and haptic information was provided. Selective attention to haptic information seemed to be an effect of lacking expectations. By simply mentioning the haptic information before the test, a driver would pay closer attention to the haptic information. This result implies that drivers might learn to use more flexible and informative multimodal interfaces in the future if the interfaces emphasize and communicate the haptic cues. This implication would be interesting to study further. In addition, future studies may apply these results to more ecologically valid driving situations.
