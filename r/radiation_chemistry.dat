25|$|<b>Radiation</b> <b>chemistry</b> is a {{subdivision}} of nuclear chemistry {{which is the}} study of the chemical effects of radiation on matter; this is very different from radiochemistry as no radioactivity needs to be present in the material which is being chemically changed by the radiation.

25|$|Radio{{chemistry}} is {{the chemistry}} of radioactive materials, where radioactive isotopes of elements are used to study the properties and chemical reactions of non-radioactive isotopes (often within radiochemistry the absence of radioactivity leads to a substance being described as being inactive as the isotopes are stable). Much of radiochemistry deals {{with the use of}} radioactivity to study ordinary chemical reactions. This is very different from <b>radiation</b> <b>chemistry</b> where the radiation levels are kept too low to influence the chemistry.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Evidence for the {{formation}} of OCN − in interstellar ice analogues is summarized with an emphasis on the recent experiments of Demyk et al. (1998). Their experiments are reinterpreted in terms of two different types of chemical reactions, acid-base and oxidation-reduction. New spectra of UVphotolyzed and p +-irradiated ices are presented, and reasons for similarities considered. The role of e − and H + scavengers in revealing ice photo- and <b>radiation</b> <b>chemistries</b> is stressed, and it is concluded that electron-transfer reactions may play a more important role than commonly thought...|$|R

40|$|Polysilane analogues of halomethylated poly(styrene) s, chloromethylated and bromomethylated poly(methylphenylsilane), {{have been}} {{prepared}} from the parent polymer by reaction with the appropriate halomethyl methyl ether. The polymers undergo a single-stage crosslinking reaction when irradiated with 20 kV electrons. As electron beam resists they operate in negative-working mode but their performance is poor {{in comparison to the}} corresponding poly(styrene) derivatives. The low lithographic sensitivities and attainable contrasts are shown to arise as a consequence of a competitive chain scission reaction which {{in the case of the}} bromomethylated system increases with increasing bromomethyl content. The <b>radiation</b> <b>chemistries</b> of the systems are rationalised in terms of modifications of the crosslinking and scission mechanisms that are thought to operate in the corresponding resists based on poly(chloromethylstyrene-stat-styrene) ...|$|R

Adsorbents have been synthesized that have a functional group (amidoxime group) that selectively adsorbs heavy metals, and the performance of such adsorbents has been improved. Uranium adsorption capacity of the polymer fiber adsorbent is high, approximately tenfold greater in comparison to the conventional titanium oxide adsorbent.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the harmful}} effects of {{radiation}} upon biological systems (induction of cancer and acute radiation injuries) and the useful effects of radiotherapy involve the <b>radiation</b> <b>chemistry</b> of water. The vast majority of biological molecules are present in an aqueous medium; when water is exposed to radiation, the water absorbs energy, and as a result forms chemically reactive species that can interact with dissolved substances (solutes). Water is ionized to form a solvated electron and H2O+, the H2O+ cation can react with water to form a hydrated proton (H3O+) and a hydroxyl radical (HO.). Furthermore, the solvated electron can recombine with the H2O+ cation to form an excited state of the water, this excited state then decomposes to species such as hydroxyl radicals (HO.), hydrogen atoms (H.) and oxygen atoms (O.). Finally, the solvated electron can react with solutes such as solvated protons or oxygen molecules to form respectively hydrogen atoms and dioxygen radical anions. The fact that oxygen changes the <b>radiation</b> <b>chemistry</b> might be one reason why oxygenated tissues are more sensitive to irradiation than the deoxygenated tissue at the centre of a tumor. The free radicals, such as the hydroxyl radical, chemically modify biomolecules such as DNA, leading to damage such as breaks in the DNA strands. Some substances can protect against radiation-induced damage by reacting with the reactive species generated by the irradiation of the water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{inventory}} of interstellar and solar system molecules now numbers well over 100 species, including ions and molecules both charged and neutral. Gas-phase formation pathways {{for many of}} the observed organics are still uncertain, so that solid-phase syntheses are of interest. Low-temperature reactions are thought to occur within interstellar ices, on ice and grain surfaces in the interstellar medium, and on icy surfaces of solar system objects (e. g. Europa, Pluto). Ionizing radiation, such as cosmic rays, and far-UV photons are two possible initiators of such chemistry. In the Cosmic Ice Lab at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, we can study both the photo-and <b>radiation</b> <b>chemistries</b> of ices at 8 - 300 K. Our most-recent work has been motivated by the detections of ethylene glycol, HOCH 2 CH 2 OH, in an interstellar source (Hollis, Lovas, Jewell, et al. 2002) and in comet Hale-Bopp (Crovisier, Bockelee-Morvan, Biver, et al. 2002). Ethylene glycol is currently the largest rmly-identied cometary molecule as well as one of the larger interstellar organics. This molecule's formation and accompanying chemistry provide challenges and tests for current astrochemical thought. Here we discuss laboratory experiments on ethylene glycol's solid-phase formation and de...|$|R

5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation.
