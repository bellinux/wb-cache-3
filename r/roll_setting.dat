40|$|The goal of {{concurrency}} control is {{to guarantee the}} correct interleaving of the operations. ROLL (Request Order Linked List) is a {{concurrency control}} method which can avoid transaction abort and minimize transaction restart. In its basic form, it requires predeclaration before a transaction is scheduled, similar to other conservative concurrency control methods, including conservative 2 PL (2 -Phase Locking), conservative TO (Timestamp Ordering), and conservative SGT (Serialization Graph Testing). For dynamic transactions, these sets may not be known until some operations are processed. To apply conservative concurrency control method to dynamic transactions, overdeclaration is used, although it lowers the concurrency. The goal {{of this paper is}} to develop alternative algorithms to process dynamic transactions in the <b>ROLL</b> <b>setting...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} on {{the influence of}} processing conditions on tempering grit rheology and the resulting molecular fragmentation of starch that occurs during the milling of conventional processed grit corn flakes. Corn grits were tempered and milled under a range of combinations of processing conditions which included low and high percent moistures and tempering temperatures. Starch fragmentation was determined using hot and cold water-soluble fractionation methods and an intermediate-pressure size-exclusion chromatograph with multi-angle laser light scattering and refractive index detection. Rheology of the tempered grits was obtained using a broad band frequency squeezing flow technique. Results showed that tempered grit moisture content and tempering temperature and time directly influence the rheology of the tempered corn grits. Rheology of the tempered corn grits was shown to directly influence mill gap width and roll vibrations. Corn grits processed under low moisture-low tempering temperatures were significantly harder. Generally, moisture content was the principal component governing final grit hardness and milled flake thickness in experiments using the same flaking <b>roll</b> <b>setting.</b> Processing conditions resulting in increased shear forces at the flaking mill produced increased amounts of fragmented amylopectin with decreasing average molecular weights. Overall, thinner flakes produced a higher degree of starch fragmentation, yet processing conditions can be modified to yield a range of starch fragmentation for any given milled flake thickness. Characterization of the fragmented starch occurring during milling is presented. Depending on processing conditions, the average molecular weight of the branched polymer was 1. 5 × 10 6 to 1. 1 × 107 Da. Resulting starch fragmentation was shown to strongly impact bowl life and overall sensory quality of the finished corn flakes. Corn flake samples containing high amounts of starch fragmentation were positively correlated to increased water uptake and increased leaching of starch fragments into water. Processing conditions resulting in corn flakes of the same milled flake thickness, but containing different amounts of starch fragmentation, further corresponded to different bowl lives with the flake sample containing the highest amount of starch fragmentation yielding the poorest bowl life. ...|$|E

40|$|For {{effective}} manufacturing of a doubly curved {{sheet metal}}, a novel {{sheet metal forming}} process is proposed. The suggested process uses a Line Array <b>Roll</b> <b>Set</b> (LARS) composed {{of a pair of}} upper and lower roll assemblies in a symmetric manner. The process offers flexibility as compared with the conventional manufacturing processes, because it does not require any complex-shaped die and loss of material by blank-holding is minimized. LARS allows flexibility of the incremental forming process and adopts the principle of bending deformation, resulting in a slight deformation in thickness. Rolls composed of line array <b>roll</b> <b>sets</b> are divided into a driving roll row and two idle roll rows. The arrayed rolls in the central lines of the upper and lower roll assemblies are motor-driven so that they deform and transfer the sheet metal using friction between the rolls and the sheet metal. The remaining rolls are idle rolls, generating bending deformation with driving rolls. Furthermore, all the rolls are movable in any direction so that they are adaptable to any size or shape of the desired three-dimensional configuration. In the process, the sheet is deformed incrementally as deformation proceeds simultaneously in rolling and transverse directions step by step. Consequently, it {{can be applied to the}} fabrication of doubly curved ship hull plates by undergoing several passes. In this work, FEM simulations are carried out for verification of the proposed incremental forming system using the chosen design parameters. Based on the results of the simulation, the relationship between the <b>roll</b> <b>set</b> configuration and the curvature of a sheet metal is determined. The process information such as the forming loads and torques acting on every roll is analyzed as important data for the design and development of the manufacturing system...|$|R
