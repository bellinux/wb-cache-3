50|$|The {{backscattering}} {{method is}} also employed in fiber optics applications to detect optical faults. Light propagating through a {{fiber optic cable}} gradually attenuates due to Rayleigh scattering. Faults are thus detected by monitoring the variation of part of the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattered</b> light. Since the backscattered light attenuates exponentially as it travels along the optical fiber cable, the attenuation characteristic is represented in a logarithmic scale graph. If {{the slope of the}} graph is steep, then power loss is high. If the slope is gentle, then optical fiber has a satisfactory loss characteristic.|$|E
50|$|Distributed {{acoustic}} sensing {{relies on}} light which is <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattered</b> from small {{variations in the}} refractive index of the fiber. The backscattered light has the same frequency as the transmitted light. There {{are a number of}} other distributed fiber sensing techniques that rely on different scattering mechanisms and can be used to measure other parameters.Brillouin scatter occurs due to the interaction between the light and acoustic phonons travelling in the fiber. As the light is scattered by a moving phonon, its frequency is shifted by the Doppler effect by around 10 GHz. Light is generated at both at above (anti-Stokes shift) and below (Stokes shift) the original optical frequency. The intensity and frequency shifts of the two components are dependent on both temperature and strain and by measuring the shifts, absolute values of the two parameters can be calculated using a distributed temperature and strain sensing (DTSS) system. Brillouin scatter is much weaker than Rayleigh scatter and so the reflections from a number of pulses must be summed together to enable the measurements to be made. Therefore, the maximum frequency at which changes can be measured using Brillouin scatter is typically a few tens of Hz.Raman scatter occurs when light is scattered in interaction with molecular vibrations in the fiber. As with Brillouin scattering, both Stokes and anti-Stokes components are produced and these are shifted from the wavelength of the incident light by several tens of nanometers. By measuring the ratio in intensity between the Stokes and anti-Stokes components, an absolute value of temperature can be measured by a distributed temperature sensing (DTS) system. The larger wavelength shifts compared to Brillouin scatter mean that it is easier to separate the scattered Raman light from the un-shifted Rayleigh scattered component. However the intensity of the Raman scatter is even lower than the Brillouin scatter and so it is normally necessary to average for many seconds or even minutes in order to get reasonable results. Therefore, Raman-based systems are only suitable for measuring slowly varying temperatures.|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) A {{distributed}} temperature {{fiber sensor}} {{based on the}} ratio of the Raman anti-Stokes to <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattered</b> light components is studied. The aim of the study is to propose a method of quantifying the noise exhibited in the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattered</b> signal and further propose correlation coding techniques to reduce the noise in the Rayleigh and Raman backscattered signals. The noise in the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattered</b> signal is referred to as “interferometric noise”. When Rayleigh scattering along the length of an optical fiber occurs, some of the scattered light travels in a direction opposite to the direction of propagation, and is called backscattered light. When the coherence length of the optical source permits interactions between the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattered</b> light, there is a possibility for the interacting backscattered light, within a distance that is half the coherence length, to interfere with each other. Furthermore, when the sensing optical fiber is greater than the coherence length of the optical source, there will be several interference sections {{along the length of the}} sensing fiber causing the intensity of the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattered</b> light at the photo-detectors to vary randomly. The intensity variation gives the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattered</b> signal a jagged appearance indicating the presence of interferometric noise. The longer the coherence length of the optical sources, the larger the intensity variations in the backscattered light, that is, the more the interferometric noise exhibited. The more the interferometric noise in the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattered</b> signal, the poorer the temperature accuracy of the distributed temperature sensor based on {{the ratio of the}} Raman anti Stokes to <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattered</b> components. To quantify the interferometric noise affecting the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattered</b> signal, a mathematical model based on well-known scattering and interferometry theories is developed. Using the developed mathematical noise model, noise powers of approximately - 52 dBm and - 40 dBm for coherence lengths of 4 m and 24 m are respectively obtained [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} covers the {{critical}} aspects of optical noise in bidirectional and optical logic systems. With applications ranging from ultra-dense transmission and fiber-to-the-home to all-optically routed networks and optical computing, bidirectional fiber optic links and optical digital logic {{play an important role}} in future photonics systems. As with any communication systems, the fundamental performance of bidirectional and optical logic systems is ultimately limited by noise. In this thesis, the impact of optical noise in bidirectional and optical logic systems is investigated with the goal of determining the optimal design and performance requirements of future systems. Two types of bidirectional optical systems are analyzed: interleaved bidirectional systems and passive optical networks. It is demonstrated, both theoretically and experimentally, that <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattering</b> noise is a fundamental limitation in bidirectional systems. Owing to its absence in conventional unidirectional systems, <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattering</b> noise is an oft neglected noise mechanism in optical fiber systems and few design rules exist which seek to minimize its impact. It is shown that in bidirectional fiber systems, <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattering</b> places markedly unique constraints on optical link design with respect to receiver design, system power budget, capacity and choice of modulation format. New design rules are offered which rigorously account for the deleterious impact of <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattering</b> noise in fiber optic systems.

40|$|In {{the present}} work {{scattering}} theory in water clouds has been studied. Alternative forms for Maxwell equations {{have been developed}} and discretized in order to calculate backscattered mean powers from cloud particles. With simplified discretized equations the backscattered electric field has been approximated for a single particle. This approximation of the electric field {{is the same as}} Rayleigh approximation used in meteorological literature. The discretized equations have been implemented in computer code to calculate backscattered power from particles inside a small box, located in the far field of radar. In current radar approach, incoherent Rayleigh approximation is used as the standard scattering theory to retrieve cloud properties. To validate this theory the correlation between particles has been studied. In order to study the influence of inter-particle displacement on correlation between particles, a new idea has been deployed to create turbulence among particles. For different turbulence settings the randomness of the medium has been quantified by the real part of the correlation matrix. In the last chapter both exact and incoherent <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattered</b> mean powers from particles have been calculated. It has been shown that <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>backscattered</b> mean powers are good approximation for uncorrelated particles and both are distributed normally around the same mean value.
