500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 15, 1910. It states: [...] "Little Marie Allen, a penniless orphan, lives with her granddad. Out for a walk she admires a huge doll in a shop window. That night, after her granddad has fallen asleep, she slips out to have {{another look at the}} doll. Arriving at the toy shop, she sees that the doll is gone. Unseen by anyone, she enters the store. She finds the wonderful doll and lifts it out of its box to admire it. Hearing a clerk approaching, she becomes frightened and gets into the doll box. The doll rolls under the counter. The clerk sends the errand boy off with the box, thinking it contains the doll, which has been ordered for Daisy Smythe, a rich little girl. Arriving at Daisy's house, Marie steps out of the box as soon as the room is empty. She removes the doll clothes from the box and admires them greatly. She decides to try them on, and soon a little cap, shoes and garments are on her figure. Then she hears Daisy coming and retreats to the box. Daisy enters and takes the supposed doll from the box, falls in love with it instantly and enthusiastically works its arms and limbs. Marie lives up to her role well, imitating with stiff, jerky movements of the limbs that belong to real dolls. Then Daisy eats, and Marie grows hungry as she watches. When Daisy sets down her bowl of milk, Marie <b>reaches</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> drinks it down. Daisy is amazed when she misses the milk. Marie helps herself to all the food and Daisy's wonderment is amusing to see. Finally Daisy falls asleep in her chair and Marie falls asleep on the floor. Here she is found by her granddad, who managed to trace her from the toy shop, and Daisy and her mother laugh so heartily over Marie's adventure that they reward her cleverness with - the doll itself!" ...|$|E

50|$|Future Ted (Bob Saget) {{describes}} to {{his children}} a day {{near the beginning of}} his struggling solo architecture career, where a set of circumstances began his journey to meet their mother. The cold open shows Ted walking down his street with a yellow umbrella, stopping at a newsstand, giving some cash to a homeless man, and stopping at a crosswalk before a woman's hand <b>reaches</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> touches his shoulder.|$|E

50|$|The wrestler {{lifts up}} a {{leg of a}} face-up {{opponent}} and wraps one of their legs around the other leg before dropping to a kneeling position, thus locking the opponent's leg behind the wrestler's knee. The wrestler then <b>reaches</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> grabs the opponent's far leg and places {{it on top of}} the trapped foot of the opponent. The wrestler then performs a forward roll while maintaining the hold. This forces the opponent onto their chest while the wrestler ends in a sitting position facing the same direction as their opponent. From here the wrestler can reach forward and perform many upper body submissions as well.|$|E
50|$|An armlock {{variation}} of the cloverleaf {{that is similar to}} a single leg Boston crab with armlock. This hold begins with a supine opponent lying face up on the mat. The attacking wrestler then seizes one of the arms and proceeds to walk over the opponent while continuing to hold the arm, forcing them to turn over onto their stomach. The wrestler then kneels down on the opponents back, locking the opponent's arm behind his knee in the process. The wrestler then <b>reaches</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> bends one leg so that the shin is behind the knee of the straight leg and places the ankle of the straight leg in their armpit. With the same arm, the wrestler reaches around the ankle and through the opening formed by the legs, and locks his hands together as in a cloverleaf. The wrestler then pulls back so as to stretch the legs, back and neck of the opponent while keeping the arm trapped.|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} season, Sean offers Quentin a limited {{partnership}} after Christian neglects {{to return to}} work after being attacked by the Carver. Initially, Christian refuses to accept having Quentin as an associate, but later changes his mind and supports the decision. A couple of episodes later, he and Sean go to a frat party together. They end up receiving fellatio from two college girls, during which Costa winks at Sean. This bothers Sean and he leaves the room. In the same episode Christian asks Costa to help take Kit McGraw off his hands because he is tired of the three-way relationship with her and Kimber Henry. While in bed with Kit on one side and Christian and Kimber on the other he <b>reaches</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> touches Christian's buttocks. Costa later explains that he is bisexual, and assumed Christian was as well. After Sean briefly leaves the practice, Costa remains to assist Christian with surgeries. Later Christian believes that Costa is on drugs and calls Sean to assist with the facial transplant surgery they are working on. Sean later returns to the practice.|$|E

5000|$|The video {{opens with}} Takeru (the lead singer) in {{what appears to}} be an old {{abandoned}} warehouse or factory using a paper cutter to make counterfeit money. After finishing, he puts the bills away and smiles, and the words, [...] "Life is all good." [...] appear as subtitles {{on the bottom of the}} screen. He then <b>reaches</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> turns on a stereo, starting the song. The song plays, showing scenes of the band dressed in Oshare Kei costumes playing their instruments and singing apparently outside of the factory at night, surrounded by fog, dead plants, dirt, and litter with paper cut-outs of animals and colored balls suspended in the air around them. Scattered images of a ventilation fan spinning, and close-ups of Takeru on a chair surrounded by subwoofers and singing into a large lollipop are shown as well. At the [...] of the song, Takeru throws the fake money into the air and continues to sing as it falls on the band like rain. After the song ends, the video cuts back to the room with the paper cutter, this time with all the band members in it counting the fake money. Their speech replaced with English subtitles, the band exclaims that they will now be able to buy anything and throw handfuls of the counterfeit bills into the air. As they continue to celebrate in silence, the English phrase, [...] "Is there the value that you can't buy for money?" [...] appears in the center of the screen and the video fades to black.|$|E
