25|$|The {{earliest}} conifers in {{the fossil}} <b>record</b> <b>date</b> {{to the late}} Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) period (about 300 million years ago), possibly arising from Cordaites, a genus of seed-bearing Gondwanan plants with cone-like fertile structures. Pinophytes, Cycadophytes, and Ginkgophytes all developed at this time. An important adaptation of these gymnosperms was allowing plants to live without being so dependent on water. Other adaptations are pollen (so fertilization can occur without water) and the seed, which allows the embryo to be transported and developed elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Ex-dividend date — the day {{on which}} shares bought and sold no longer come {{attached}} {{with the right to}} be paid the most recently declared dividend. In the United States, it is typically 2 trading days before the <b>record</b> <b>date.</b> This is an important date for any company that has many stockholders, including those that trade on exchanges, to enable reconciliation of who is entitled to be paid the dividend. Existing holders of the stock will receive the dividend even if they sell the stock on or after that date, whereas anyone who bought the stock will not receive the dividend. It is relatively common for a stock's price to decrease on the ex-dividend date by an amount roughly equal to the dividend paid. This reflects the decrease in the company's assets resulting from the declaration of the dividend.|$|E

2500|$|By this time, RCA Victor {{had begun}} {{a series of}} {{recordings}} called Jazz Workshop, and soon Russell, through the intervention of McKustic and Jack Lewis, was granted his own <b>record</b> <b>date.</b> Then, Russell assembled trumpeter Art Farmer, guitarist Barry Galbraith, bassist Milt Hinton and Evans for three recording dates, along with rehearsal sessions. In these, only the bassist was given a written part, while the rest were left, and, according to Farmer, [...] "took the parts at home and tried {{to come to terms}} with them". The album took a year to do, and it was successful enough to enable Russell to escape his penurious lifestyle. Evans performed a notable solo in [...] "Concerto for Billy the Kid".|$|E
5000|$|If the <b>record</b> <b>date</b> {{is not a}} {{business}} day, then counting begins from the most recent business day instead of the actual <b>record</b> <b>date.</b> For instance, if the <b>record</b> <b>date</b> is Sunday, then the ex-dividend date is the preceding Wednesday, not Thursday — assuming no intervening holidays.|$|E
5000|$|To be {{entitled}} to a special dividend of less than 25% of the share price, {{you need to be}} a stockholder on the <b>record</b> <b>date.</b> To be a stockholder on the <b>record</b> <b>date,</b> your purchase would need to have been made a minimum of three business days prior to the <b>record</b> <b>date,</b> and you would still have to own it on that day. The ex-dividend date, i.e. the first date in which a new buyer of shares would not {{be entitled}} to the dividend, is two business days prior to the <b>record</b> <b>date</b> (see ex-dividend date for exceptions).|$|E

50|$|For shares {{listed on}} the London Stock Exchange, the {{ex-dividend}} date is usually one business day before the <b>record</b> <b>date.</b> The ex-dividend date is almost always on a Thursday with the associated <b>record</b> <b>date</b> on the next Friday. Exceptions to this timetable are usually special dividends, and dividends provided by overseas issuers who only have a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange.

50|$|The {{ex-dividend}} date is two {{business days}} prior to the <b>record</b> <b>date.</b> To be a stockholder on the <b>record</b> <b>date</b> an investor must purchase the stock before the ex-dividend date. The latest date he can buy the stock to be a stockholder on record and be entitled to the dividend would be one day prior to the ex-dividend date (this includes extended hours (pre-market and after-hours) of that day) {{to allow for the}} three stock trading day settlement of the stock purchase. If the investor purchases the stock the day before the ex-dividend date the investor would be a stockholder on the <b>record</b> <b>date</b> and would be entitled to receive the dividend payment.|$|E
50|$|An {{investor}} {{who wishes to}} be entitled to the dividend does not have to wait until after the <b>record</b> <b>date</b> to sell the stock; however, the investor must hold the stock until the ex-dividend date. If the investor were to sell the stock on the ex-dividend date or afterwards, the investor would still be entitled to the dividend payment. In this example, assuming that the investor purchased the stock one day before the ex-dividend date, the investor would be a stockholder on the <b>record</b> <b>date.</b> If the investor sells the stock on the ex-dividend date, the buyer of the stock would be a stockholder one day after the <b>record</b> <b>date</b> given the three stock business trading day settlement. The person that bought the stock would not be entitled to receive the dividend.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the case}} of a special {{dividend}} of 25% or more, however, special rules that are quite different apply. If you sell stock after the <b>record</b> <b>date</b> but before the ex-dividend date, your shares will be sold with a book entry sometimes called a [...] "due bill," [...] which denotes that (though the company will pay the dividend to your account, if you are the shareholder of record on the date three business days prior to the <b>record</b> <b>date),</b> your account must, in turn, turn the amount of that dividend over to the buyer of your stock. Conversely, if you buy stock after the <b>record</b> <b>date</b> but before the ex-dividend date of a large special dividend, you are entitled to the dividend and will receive it via the due bill process.|$|E
50|$|Many {{publicly}} traded companies, and some privately held ones, provide a dividend feature to their stock. Stock shares trade fluidly on public markets, {{such that the}} state of share ownership differs {{at the end of each}} trading day, and any given share may have a series of various owners over time. When declaring a dividend, a company will designate a <b>record</b> <b>date</b> for the dividend. The practical rules of the financial system determine precisely one of the owners to receive the dividend payment, namely the owner of record who owned the share(s) at the end of the trading day on the <b>record</b> <b>date.</b> The company thus resolves payment to the share owner identified on the company's share register as of the <b>record</b> <b>date.</b> Since the process of settlement involves some days of delay, stock exchanges set an earlier date, known as the ex-dividend date (typically two business days prior to the <b>record</b> <b>date)</b> to synchronize the time for this processing. Thus the key date for a stock purchase is the ex-dividend date: a purchase on that date (or after) will be ex (outside, without right to) the dividend.|$|E
