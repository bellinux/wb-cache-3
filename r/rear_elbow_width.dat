40|$|Background Innovative imaging techniques, using {{up-to-date}} ultrasonic equipment, necessitate specific biometry. The aim of {{our study}} was to test the possibility of detailed human embryonic biometry using a virtual reality (VR) technique. Methods In a longitudinal study, three-dimensional (3 D) measurements were performed from 6 to 14 weeks gestational age in 32 pregnancies (n = 16 spontaneous conception, n = 16 IVF/ICSI). A total of 125 3 D volumes were analysed in the I-Space VR system, which allows binocular depth perception, providing a realistic 3 D illusion. Crown-rump length (CRL), biparietal diameter (BPD), occipito-frontal diameter (OFD), head circumference (HC) and abdominal circumference (AC) were measured as well as arm length, shoulder <b>width,</b> <b>elbow</b> <b>width,</b> hip width and knee width. Result SCRL, BPD, OFD and HC could be measured in more than 96 of patients, and AC in 78. Shoulder <b>width,</b> <b>elbow</b> <b>width,</b> hip width and knee width could be measured in more than 95 of cases, and arm length in 82 of cases. Growth curves were constructed for all variables. Ear and foot measurements were only possible beyond 9 weeks gestation. Conclusions This study provides a detailed, longitudinal description of normal human embryonic growth, facilitated by a VR system. Growth curves were created for embryonic biometry of the CRL, BPD, HC and AC early in pregnancy and also of several 'new' biometric measurements. Applying virtual embryoscopy {{will enable us to}} diagnose growth and/or developmental delay earlier and more accurately.

40|$|The {{present study}} has been {{designed}} to provide information about any possible differentiation between the growth of deaf-mutes and the normal boys. A cross-sectional sample of 267 deaf-mute boys from 5 to 18 years was collected from various educational institutes of Punjab specially meant to teach hearing impaired children who were otherwise normal. Various anthropometric measurements were taken on each subject with the help of techniques given by Lohman et al. (1988) which included weight and height, humerus and femur bicondylar diameter, upper arm and calf circumferences, skinfolds at triceps and subscapular. In a nutshell, it has been found that the deaf-mute boys of the present study lag behind the normal in early years of life in height, have significantly smaller <b>elbow</b> <b>widths</b> and are more fatty at triceps skinfold. The ecological factors and mental attitude of the populace have not changed from those of the past in case of deafmutes while there is a tremendous improvement in the otherwise living standards of the general population.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{identify}} the differentiation of body composition among players of Polish national baseball team in comparison to persons of the same population not professionally engaged in sport. The study involved Polish baseball representatives (n= 20). Competitors’ age was 18 - 28 years, body mass from 67. 7 kg to 114 kg (85 ± 10. 3 kg), and body height 173 - 196 cm (185. 1 ± 4. 8). The training experience was 7 - 14 years and it was highly differentiated. The stoutness factor is the dominant factor among "infielders" and "pitchers", and among "outfielders" - the length one. The proportions of the features within the factors show that players are characterized by a strongly muscled forearm and a shank and by a clear predominance of the <b>elbow</b> <b>width</b> with a disproportionately - to the overall size of the factor - small knee and shoulder width.

40|$|Background: Anthropometry {{plays an}} {{important}} role in industrial design, clothing design, ergonomics and architecture where statistical data about the distribution of body dimensions in the population are used to optimize products. Changes in lifestyles, nutrition, and ethnic composition of populations lead to changes in the distribution of body dimensions (e. g. the obesity epidemic), and require regular updating of anthropometric data collections. Aim and Objectives: This study analyzed the variation in anthropometric dimensions and body composition parameters of working women employees of different geographical zones. Material and Methods: The study was undertaken on nine hundred forty (940) women employees of Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) working in seventeen different laboratories and belonged to different states of India. The age range of studied women was between 20 - 60 years. Fourteen body dimensions namely stature, popliteal height, knee height, buttock to popliteal length, hip breadth, waist breadth, shoulder breadth, forearm length, arm length, eye height (sitting), sitting shoulder height, hand length, hand breadth and <b>elbow</b> <b>width</b> were measured in cm using Martin anthropometers and Martin's sliding caliper. Body composition parameters like weight, percentage body fat, fat mass and fat free mass were recorded. Results: All anthropometric parameters were found significantly different (p< 0. 001). Body composition variables of women were also found significantly different in all three zones but fat free mass was not significantly different. Conclusion:It can be concluded that diet, environmental conditions and living style of different regions can influence the anthropometry and body composition of the individuals, however the influence of ethnic, genetic and hereditary factor are not controlled in this study...|$|R

30|$|Moreover, Kamath et al. {{suggested}} in their systematic review {{that the use}} of Kirshner wires or smooth pins for fixation could not achieve adequate compression, leading in some cases to bony nonunion [30]. However, a potential drawback of screw fixation is the symptomatic prominence of the screw head over the epicondyle, which produces irritation that sometimes requires the removal of the hardware [9, 31]. Another factor that should be taken into account in the choice of the surgical technique is the patient’s age. In fact, {{it has been suggested that}} the ratio of <b>elbow</b> growth to <b>width</b> has the same biomechanical importance as longitudinal growth in terms of muscle balance and stability [32]. Therefore, in very young patients, K-wire fixation should be preferred, since screws should be routinely removed to avoid growth anomalies [28, 33].|$|R

40|$|Cricket fielding often {{involves}} maximal acceleration {{to retrieve the}} ball. There has been no analysis of acceleration specific to cricketers, or for players who field primarily in the infield (closer to the pitch) or outfield (closer to the boundary). This study analyzed the first two steps of a 10 -m sprint in experienced cricketers. Eighteen males (age = 24. 06 ± 4. 87 years; height = 1. 81 ± 0. 06 m; mass = 79. 67 ± 10. 37 kg) were defined as primarily infielders (n = 10) or outfielders (n = 8). Timing lights recorded 0 - 5 and 0 - 10 m time. Motion capture measured first and second step kinematics, including: step length; step frequency; contact time; shoulder motion; lead and <b>rear</b> arm <b>elbow</b> angle; drive leg hip and knee extension, and ankle plantar flexion; swing leg hip and knee flexion, and ankle dorsi flexion. A {{one-way analysis of variance}} (p < 0. 05) determined between-group differences. Data was pooled for a Pearson’s correlation analysis (p < 0. 05) to analyze kinematic relationships. There were no differences in sprint times, and few variables differentiated infielders and outfielders. Left shoulder range of motion related to second step length (r = 0. 471). First step hip flexion correlated with both step lengths (r = 0. 570 - 0. 598), and frequencies (r = - 0. 504 [...] 0. 606). First step knee flexion related to both step lengths (r = 0. 528 - 0. 682), and first step frequency (r = - 0. 669). First step ankle plantar flexion correlated with second step length (r = - 0. 692) and frequency (r = 0. 726). Greater joint motion ranges related to longer steps. Cricketers display similar sprint kinematics regardless of fielding position, likely because players may field in the infield or outfield depending on match situation. Due to relationships with shoulder and leg motion, and the importance and trainability of step length, cricketers should target this variable to enhance acceleration...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} food and {{nutrient}} intake, activity levels and body composition of migrant Chinese children living in Auckland, and compare the results with data from European children {{of the same age}} in New Zealand. Subjects: Fifty children aged between 7 to 10 years of age, who were born in Mainland China and have immigrated to New Zealand (twenty-seven boys and twenty-three girls). Method: Three 24 -hour recalls were used to evaluate dietary intake. Questionnaires were pretested before survey, and were used to determine food consumption patterns, demographic details, medical status, lifestyle and activity patterns. Anthropometric measurements included were height, weight, upper arm circumference, triceps skinfold, subscapular skinfold and elbow breadth. BMI was calculated. Results: • The average body height and weight of the migrant Chinese children was 131. 8 cm and 29. 2 kg respectively, higher and heavier than their peers in Mainland China. Each anthropometric measurement was higher in 9 - 10 year old children than 7 - 8 year old children, but only the differences between weight (p < 0. 001), arm circumference (p < 0. 005), and <b>elbow</b> <b>width</b> (p < 0. 001) were significant. Except the triceps skinfold, most anthropometric measurements for the migrant Chinese children were lower than the European children in the Validation Report for the Children's Nutrition Survey in New Zealand, indicating Chinese children had higher arm fat and lower muscle than their counterparts in new Zealand. • The overall average energy intake of migrant Chinese children was 7712 kJ, close to the recommendations. The average protein intake of children was well above the UK RNI and USA RDA values (69. 3 g compared with RNI of 28. 3 g and RDA of 28. 0 g), and higher than that of their New Zealand and Mainland Chinese counterparts. Mean percentage of food energy derived from carbohydrate was 52. 5 %. Mean percentages of food energy derived from fat and saturated fat were 29. 6 and 12. 8, respectively. The fat intake of children was higher than that found in Mainland Chinese children where the mean percentage of total energy from fat in this age group varies from 23. 4 - 28. 5. However, it was lower than that found in New Zealand European children where the average percentages of food energy derived from fat and saturated fat were 34. 9 and 16. 3 for boys, and 31. 4 and 13. 8 for girls, respectively. • Mean intakes of most micronutrients were in excess of UK RNI. Lower intakes of vitamin A Eq were found (95. 5 % of RNI and 68. 5 % of RDA), reflecting lower consumption of fruits and vegetables than European New Zealand children. • The food frequency questionnaire designed to assess nutrient intake in New Zealand European, Maori and Pacific children in the Children's Nutrition Survey was not applicable to migrant Chinese children. • For the children in this study, breakfast and lunch at school, especially lunch at school, were "Westernized". Dinner of the children mainly maintained Chinese traditional foods. • While parents of the children realized the importance of modern nutrition, most of them applied the ancient Chinese philosophies regarding food and health to their children. Seventy percent of the parents could feel their children in "hot" or "cold" conditions, and used dietary restriction or encouraged their children to eat certain foods when their children were in hot" or "cold" conditions. All the Cantonese families used herbs in their children's dishes. • In these Chinese families, the mothers played a very important role in determining food choice of their children. • The migrant Chinese children achieved the recommended activity levels. However, their activity levels were lower than their counterparts in New Zealand. Conclusions: • The trend towards increasing fat and protein intake should be avoided in migrant Chinese children, and the importance of maintaining the traditional Chinese cereal-based diet should be emphasized. • Foods rich in vitamin A should be recommended for the migrant Chinese children. • It is crucial that migrant Chinese children during their diet transition adopt healthy western food habits. • Cultural preferences and mothers' influence should be considered when making nutrition recommendations for migrant Chinese children...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigates the}} wearing trend and {{purchase}} facts for adult females in their 20 s and 30 s {{along with their}} fitting satisfaction for woven jackets and circular knitted jackets. A questionnaire survey on consumers investigated satisfaction with jackets according to clothing materials and repair trend after wearing. Subsequently, a preference for cir-cular knitted jackets was shown higher than woven jackets. Females in their 20 s preferred woven jackets than those in their 30 s; however, the latter preferred circular knitted jackets than the former. For woven jackets, they showed the high-est satisfaction with size; however, for circular knitted jackets, they showed the highest satisfaction with fitting. In the question on their satisfaction by jacket part, satisfaction with circular knitted jackets was higher in all items except for bust measurement, bottom edge measurement, <b>elbow</b> circumference, shoulder <b>width,</b> and clothes length. Circular knitted jackets had lower repair rates than woven jackets and woven jackets had significant differences by age in satisfaction with back width. The research results indicate that females in their 20 s and 30 s who value fit preference and practicality will increasingly wear knit clothes. Therefore, we can address the fitting satisfaction requirement of females in their 20 s and 30 s by taking the clothing material properties of circular knitted clothes into consideration. In addition, further research is required on jacket patterns in consideration of clothing materials.

6000|$|On {{the death}} of the father there {{remained}} golden-haired Kirstie, who took service with her distant kinsfolk, the Rutherfords, and black-a-vised Gilbert, twenty years older, who farmed the Cauldstaneslap, married, and begot four sons between 1773 and 1784, and a daughter, like a postscript, in ’97, the year of Camperdown and Cape St. Vincent. It seemed it was a tradition in the family to wind up with a belated girl. In 1804, at the age of sixty, Gilbert met an end that might be called heroic. He was due home from market any time from eight at night till five in the morning, and in any condition from the quarrelsome to the speechless, for he maintained to that age the goodly customs of the Scots farmer. It was known on this occasion that he had a good bit of money to bring home; the word had gone round loosely. The laird had shown his guineas, and if anybody had but noticed it, there was an ill-looking, vagabond crew, the scum of Edinburgh, that drew out of the market long ere it was dusk and took the hill-road by Hermiston, where {{it was not to be}} believed that they had lawful business. One of the country-side, one Dickieson, they took with them to be their guide, and dear he paid for it! Of a sudden in the ford of the Broken Dykes, this vermin clan fell on the laird, six to one, and him three parts asleep, having drunk hard. But it is ill to catch an Elliott. For a while, in the night and the black water that was deep as to his saddle-girths, he wrought with his staff like a smith at his stithy, and great was the sound of oaths and blows. With that the ambuscade was burst, and he rode for home with a pistol-ball in him, three knife wounds, the loss of his front teeth, a broken rib and bridle, and a dying horse. That was a race with death that the laird rode! In the mirk night, with his broken bridle and his head swimming, he dug his spurs to the rowels in the horse’s side, and the horse, that was even worse off than himself, the poor creature! screamed out loud like a person as he went, so that the hills echoed with it, and the folks at Cauldstaneslap got to their feet about the table and looked at each other with white faces. The horse fell dead at the yard gate, the laird won the length of the house and fell there on the threshold. To the son that raised him he gave the bag of money. “Hae,” said he. All the way up the thieves had seemed to him to be at his heels, but now the hallucination left him—he saw them again in the place of the ambuscade—and the thirst of vengeance seized on his dying mind. Raising himself and pointing with an imperious finger into the black night from which he had come, he uttered the single command, “Brocken Dykes,” and fainted. He had never been loved, but he had been feared in honour. At that sight, at that word, gasped out at them from a toothless and bleeding mouth, the old Elliott spirit awoke with a shout in the four sons. “Wanting the hat,” continues my author, Kirstie, whom I but haltingly follow, for she told this tale like one inspired, “wanting guns, for there wasna twa grains o’ pouder in the house, wi’ nae mair weepons than their sticks into their hands, the fower o’ them took the road. Only Hob, and that was the eldest, hunkered at the doorsill where the blood had rin, fyled his hand wi’ it—and haddit it up to Heeven in the way o’ the auld Border aith. ‘Hell shall have her ain again this nicht!’ he raired, and rode forth upon his earrand.” It was three miles to Broken Dykes, down hill, and a sore road. Kirstie has seen men from Edinburgh dismounting there in plain day to lead their horses. But the four brothers rode it as if Auld Hornie were behind and Heaven in front. Come to the ford, and there was Dickieson. By all tales, he was not dead, but breathed and <b>reared</b> upon his <b>elbow,</b> and cried out to them for help. It was at a graceless face that he asked mercy. As soon as Hob saw, by the glint of the lantern, the eyes shining and the whiteness of the teeth in the man’s face, “Damn you!” says he; “ye hae your teeth, hae ye?” and rode his horse to and fro upon that human remnant. Beyond that, Dandie must dismount with the lantern to be their guide; he was the youngest son, scarce twenty at the time. “A’ nicht long they gaed in the wet heath and jennipers, and whaur they gaed they neither knew nor cared, but just followed the bluid stains and the footprints o’ their faither’s murderers. And a’ nicht Dandie had his nose to the grund like a tyke, and the ithers followed and spak’ naething, neither black nor white. There was nae noise to be heard, but just the sough of the swalled burns, and Hob, the dour yin, risping his teeth as he gaed.” With the first glint of the morning they saw they were on the drove road, and at that the four stopped and had a dram to their breakfasts, for they knew that Dand must have guided them right, and the rogues could be but little ahead, hot foot for Edinburgh by the way of the Pentland Hills. By eight o’clock they had word of them—a shepherd had seen four men “uncoly mishandled” go by in the last hour. “That’s yin a piece,” says Clem, and swung his cudgel. “Five o’ them!” says Hob. “God’s death, but the faither was a man! And him drunk!” And then there befell them what my author termed “a sair misbegowk,” for they were overtaken by a posse of mounted neighbours come to aid in the pursuit. Four sour faces looked on the reinforcement. “The Deil’s broughten you!” said Clem, and they rode thenceforward in the rear of the party with hanging heads. Before ten they had found and secured the rogues, and by three of the afternoon, as they rode up the Vennel with their prisoners, they were aware of a concourse of people bearing in their midst something that dripped. “For the boady of the saxt,” pursued Kirstie, “wi’ his head smashed like a hazelnit, had been a’ that nicht in the chairge o’ Hermiston Water, and it dunting it on the stanes, and grunding it on the shallows, and flinging the deid thing heels-ower-hurdie at the Fa’s o’ Spango; and in the first o’ the day, Tweed had got a hold o’ him and carried him off like a wind, for it was uncoly swalled, and raced wi’ him, bobbing under brae-sides, and was long playing with the creature in the drumlie lynns under the castle, and at the hinder end of all cuist him up on the starling of Crossmichael brig. Sae there they were a’thegither at last (for Dickieson had been brought in on a cart long syne), and folk could see what mainner o’man my brither had been that had held his head again sax and saved the siller, and him drunk!” Thus died of honourable injuries and in the savour of fame Gilbert Elliott of the Cauldstaneslap; but his sons had scarce less glory out of the business. Their savage haste, the skill with which Dand had found and followed the trail, the barbarity to the wounded Dickieson (which was like an open secret in the county), and the doom which it was currently supposed they had intended for the others, struck and stirred popular imagination. Some century earlier the last of the minstrels might have fashioned the last of the ballads out of that Homeric fight and chase; but the spirit was dead, or had been reincarnated already in Mr. Sheriff Scott, and the degenerate moorsmen must be content to tell the tale in prose, and to make of the “Four Black Brothers” a unit after the fashion of the “Twelve Apostles” or the “Three Musketeers.” ...|$|R

Kirstie had seen men from Edinburgh dismounting there in plain day to lead their horses. But the four brothers rode it as if Auld Hornie were behind and Heaven in front. Come to the ford, and there was Dickieson. By all tales, he was not dead, but breathed and <b>reared</b> upon his <b>elbow,</b> and cried out to them for help. It was at a graceless face that he asked mercy. As soon as Hob saw, by the glint of the lantern, the eyes shining and the whiteness of the teeth in the man's face, [...] "Damn you!" [...] says he; [...] "ye hae your teeth, hae ye?" [...] and rode his horse to and fro upon that human remnant. Beyond that, Dandie must dismount with the lantern to be their guide; he was the youngest son, scarce twenty at the time. [...] "A' nicht long they gaed in the wet heath and jennipers, and whaur they gaed they neither knew nor cared, but just followed the bluid-stains and the footprints o' their faither's murderers. And a' nicht Dandie had his nose to the grund like a tyke, and the ithers followed and spak' naething, neither black nor white. There was nae noise to be heard, but just the sough of the swalled burns, and Hob, the dour yin, risping his teeth as he gaed." [...] With the first glint of the morning they saw they were on the drove-road, and at that the four stopped and had a dram to their breakfasts, for they knew that Dand must have guided them right, and the rogues could be but little ahead, hot foot for Edinburgh by the way of the Pentland Hills. By eight o'clock they had word of them--a shepherd had seen four men [...] "uncoly mishandled" [...] go by in the last hour. [...] "That's yin a piece," [...] says Clem, and swung his cudgel. [...] "Five o' them!" [...] says Hob. [...] "God's death, but the faither was a man! And him drunk!" [...] And then there befell them what my author termed [...] "a sair misbegowk," [...] for they were overtaken by a posse of mounted neighbours come to aid in the pursuit. Four sour faces looked on the reinforcement. [...] "The Deil's broughten you!" [...] said Clem, and they rode thenceforward in the rear of the party with hanging heads. Before ten they had found and secured the rogues, and by three of the afternoon, as they rode up the Vennel with their prisoners, they were aware of a concourse of people bearing in their midst something that dripped. [...] "For the boady of the saxt," [...] pursued Kirstie, [...] "wi' his head smashed like a hazel-nit, had been a' that nicht in the chairge o' Hermiston Water, and it dunting in on the stanes, and grunding it on the shallows, and flinging the deid thing heels-ower-hurdie at the Fa's o' Spango; and in the first o' the day, Tweed had got a hold o' him and carried him off like a wind, for it was uncoly swalled, and raced wi' him, bobbing under braesides, and was long playing with the creature in the drumlie lynns under the castle, and at the hinder end of all cuist him up on the sterling of Crossmichael brig. Sae there they were a'thegither at last (for Dickieson had been brought in on a cart long syne), and folk could see what mainner o' man my brither had been that had held his head again sax and saved the siller, and him drunk!" [...] Thus died of honourable injuries and in the savour of fame Gilbert Elliott of the Cauldstaneslap; but his sons had scarce less glory out of the business. Their savage haste, the skill with which Dand had found and followed the trail, the barbarity to the wounded Dickieson (which was like an open secret in the county), and the doom which it was currently supposed they had intended for the others, struck and stirred popular imagination. Some century earlier the last of the minstrels might have fashioned the last of the ballads out of that Homeric fight and chase; but the spirit was dead, or had been reincarnated already in Mr. Sheriff Scott, and the degenerate moorsmen must be content to tell the tale in prose, and to make of the [...] "Four Black Brothers" [...] a unit after the fashion of the [...] "Twelve Apostles" [...] or the [...] "Three Musketeers." ...|$|R
