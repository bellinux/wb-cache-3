Vertical spacing between geotextile reinforcement was varied while maintaining a constant slope angle, load position, soil density and geotextile type. Small-scale physical tests were conducted using a large beam centrifuge to simulate field prototype conditions. After the model was accelerated to 40 g, a load {{was applied to the}} strip footing until slope failure occurred. Digital image analysis was performed, using photographs taken in-flight, to obtain slope displacements and strain distribution along the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>layers</b> at different loading pressures during the test and at failure. Stability analysis was also conducted and compared with centrifuge model test results. The vertical spacing between <b>reinforcement</b> <b>layers</b> has {{a significant impact on the}} stability of a reinforced slope when subjected to a vertical load.

The test tank had an arrangement for the water table rise, {{from the bottom of}} the sand bed constructed in the tank. The model strip footing was placed at the surface of the sand bed, and measurement of the settlement occurring with the rise of the water table, was taken to observe the effect of water table rise. When the water table reached the top surface of the sand bed, that is, the sand bed was fully submerged under water; the measurement of settlement of the footing was continued, by applying the load incrementally through the hydraulic jack. The results show that the rise of the water table causes a significant settlement of the footing for both unreinforced and reinforced cases. However, the beneficial effect of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>layers</b> was observed in terms of increased load-bearing capacity.

Deformation of geosynthetics embedded granular layer due to bending and shear is considered in this study.

Tension developed in the geosynthetics, rotation and settlements of the improved soft ground are predicted using the proposed model. This study shows the effects of multilayer geosynthetics on the settlement response of the granular layer.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Knowing {{the load}} in {{geosynthetic}} <b>reinforcement</b> <b>layers</b> in full-scale walls {{is an important}} step to improving internal stability design methods. Interpretation of empirical reinforcement load data enables analytical models to be properly calibrated. High-quality empirical data also provides a baseline against which new design methods can be validated. In this paper, loads in soil <b>reinforcement</b> <b>layers</b> from 16 full-scale geo-synthetic wall case histories were estimated from strain measurements and converted to load through the stiffness of the reinforcement material. The paper summarizes these estimated peak loads, describes general trends in the data, and compares these reinforce-ment loads to predictions using current design practice applied to the wall case histories. It was found that reinforcement loads derived from strain measurements are, in general, much lower than would be predicted based on current limit equilibrium design methods that use classical earth pressure theory. The low reinforcement strains and loads mea-sured to date in geosynthetic walls point to the desirability of using peak soil shear strength rather than constant volume shear strength for design. This approach will help to reduce design conservatism and will be consistent with the philosophy of preventin...|$|R
