But the next day things have changed when the two Prime Ministers met privately at the <b>retreat</b> <b>session</b> which led to Pakistan agreeing one out of three proposed agreements and they also met and shook hands publicly during the closing ceremony and this 'transient peace' in the relation was believed to brokered by the Nepalese side as a face-saving measure for the Kathmandu summit.|$|E

The goal of the Retreat is {{traditionally}} to plan the upcoming run in the light of the results from the previous one, by providing a snapshot of the present understanding of the machine and a forum for free and frank discussion. A particular attention was paid to the challenge of increasing the time at store, and the related issue of system reliability. An interesting Session covered all new developments aimed to improve the machine performance and luminosity. In Section 2 we summarize the results from Run- 7 for RHIC and the injectors and discuss the present objectives of the RHIC program and performance.

50|$|The {{stages of}} the lower tantras {{can be divided into}} 4 parts; empowerments; vows and commitments; close retreats; common and {{uncommon}} attainments. Every tantra requires the empowerment of a guru in order to enter and proceed along the path, and normally {{there are a number of}} different empowerments for different practices, and in addition the Bodhisattva and Tantric vows must be taken. A close <b>retreat</b> involves intense <b>sessions</b> of meditation in the practice of deity yoga (concentration on one's personal yidam and their mantra), and the common and uncommon attainments are the occult powers, or siddhis, that are obtained as a result of that practice.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 33) This project {{described the}} pilot program {{conducted during the}} Spring semester of 1978, at Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, California, called United Students. United Students was a student organization originally necessitated by the existence of identified racial isolation on campus. It was funded {{by a grant from}} the Los Angeles City School's General Fund and was conducted by graduate students of California State University, Northridge, Department of Educational Psychology, Counseling and Guidance. Participants included students and teachers of various backgrounds and ethnicities at Birmingham High School. The program included bi-weekly group conversation <b>sessions,</b> <b>retreats,</b> field trips and training in group dynamics and facilitation. This project cited the necessity for the development and implementation of such an organization in schools throughout the Los Angeles area which are presently, or will eventually be integrated. It proposed program execution to the Los Angeles Unified School District and included a complete program description. The conclusions drawn from this project are that 1) the need exists for similar programs in integrated high schools; 2) the proposed program is feasible and available for implementation; and 3) such programs are successful on both local and national levels...|$|R
