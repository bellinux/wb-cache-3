There is no limit on the amount or repayment period. Unsecured agreements for more than R8,000 and/or repayable over more than six months fall into this category. The maximum interest rate is linked to the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) <b>Repurchase</b> <b>Rate</b> ((<b>Repurchase</b> <b>Rate</b> x 2.2) + 20% per year), and is currently 39,8 per cent per year (based on the current repo rate of nine per cent). This maximum rate is nearly double the maximum permissible rate in terms of the Usury Act that applied until May 31, 2007 (20 per cent per year). Sales of furniture, for example, could now cost twice as much to service.|$|E
50|$|Repo (<b>Repurchase)</b> <b>rate</b> {{also known}} as the {{benchmark}} interest rate is {{the rate at which the}} RBI lends money to the banks for a short-term. When the repo rate increases, borrowing from RBI becomes more expensive. If RBI wants to make it more expensive for the banks to borrow money, it increases the repo rate similarly, if it wants to make it cheaper for banks to borrow money it reduces the repo rate.If the repo rate is increased, banks can't carry out their business at a profit whereas the very opposite happens when the repo rate is cut down. Generally, repo rates are cut down whenever the country needs to progress in banking and economy. Currently, the new RBI Governor Sri Urjit Patel has cut the previous Repo rate to 6.00% for facilitation of India's economy.|$|E

The first part of the research is a conceptual model that illustrates how customer uncertainty provides an explanation for why promotionally acquired cus-tomers have lower <b>repurchase</b> <b>rates</b> and smaller lifetime values. The sec-ond part of the research involves empirical analyses of customer-level data from a newspaper and an online grocer.

We then ask how the small differences between these securities, in particular their liquidity, could project to such a large gap in prices. We gauge the potential for bond-note arbitrage in two ways. First, with data on <b>repurchase</b> <b>rates</b> and fails, we highlight the frictions arbitrageurs encountered in funding a short position in the notes. Second, with daily transactions data on trades by insurance companies, who are large buy-and-hold fixed income investors, we relate demand for the expensive but liquid note to the cross section of insurers’ characteristics...|$|R

Using customer data from the Indian micro-finance institution BASIX, I find that receiving an insurance payout {{is associated with a}} 9 - 22 % increased probability of purchasing insurance the following year. These empirical results are consistent with the predictions of a loss aversion model where receiving insurance payouts shifts a customer’s reference point, resulting in higher risk aversion and therefore greater demand for insurance. I do not find significant support for other potential mechanisms, such as previous weather directly affecting insurance decisions or payouts increasing trust in the insurance companies. Overall, low <b>repurchasing</b> <b>rates</b> even after payouts suggest that current rainfall index insurance products are likely to continue struggling in their current form. ...|$|R

Studies who investigated the satisfaction–retention link have shown that the relationship is weak and that customers repeatedly defect even though they state to be highly satisfied. Recent research has successfully been able to identify variables that moderate the link between satisfaction and repurchase behavior and can partially explain the weak overall relationship. However, almost all of previous research has been conducted in single brand, business-to-consumer contexts. In contrast to these studies, we investigate the differential effect of the manufacturer on the satisfaction–retention link in a business-to-business setting. Results show, that the satisfaction–retention link is moderated by demographic characteristics of a decider in a buying center, characteristics of the purchasing company and the manufacturer.

40|$|Part One {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} relationship between search effort and postpurchase satisfaction for (a) buyers of Asian, European, Ford, G.

The results of using confirmatory factor analysis indicates that search has an insignificant effect on the satisfaction of switchers, and {{a negative effect on}} repeaters. Other findings show that search effort has a positive direct effect on satisfaction for buyers of Asian makes and a negative direct effect on satisfaction of buyers of Chrysler makes. ^ Part Two establishes the effect of satisfaction on both intended and actual <b>repurchase</b> <b>rate</b> and positive and negative word-of-mouth behavior. A logit specification in a system of seemingly unrelated regression equations is employed to accomplish this task. The findings verify these hypotheses and conclude that satisfaction is indeed very beneficial for the firm. Moreover, by using likelihood ratio tests and comparing elasticities, support for the hypotheses that (1) the effect of satisfaction on <b>repurchase</b> <b>rate</b> decays over time, and (2) satisfaction has a greater impact on negative than positive word-of-mouth behavior, is found. ^ Part Three models the effect of satisfaction on loyalty and switching behavior for market segments, manufacturers, and makes within a manufacturer. A two-choice stochastic model is used, which is a modification of Blumen 2 ̆ 7 s mover-stayer model. The results validate that satisfaction affects loyalty for all submarkets. However, for shoppers or non-loyals, satisfaction affects repeating and switching behavior only when the market is partitioned according to manufacturer. Satisfaction has no effect on the switching of customers from one market segment to another. ...|$|E

For this purpose, we examined Abnormal Return and Cumulative Abnormal Return of Australia, Canada, Euro Zone, UK, Japan and the U.

This study analyzed 184 nominal <b>repurchase</b> <b>rates</b> in a monthly base for each country's benchmark bond as a time series. In calculating Abnormal Return, US's Government Benchmark Bond's Rate and Euro Zone's Government Benchmark Bond's Rate have been determined as comparison parameters to the other countries. According to cumulative abnormal returns, we have detected which country has dramatically dropped against both the U. S. ’s and Euro zone's benchmark bond yield. With this evidence, we have taken into account any co-integrating relationships among the countries’ benchmark bonds. We analyzed (Johansen & Juselius, 1990) Co-integration Test to determine any long term relationship between them. In addition to the Co-integration test, we need to determine any short term effect for each series.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{condition of}} global affairs has been volatile {{since the turn}} of the century. The impact of the global financial crisis has left sections of the world paralyzed and others are still recovering from the impact it had on their respective economies. Economic crises have an enormous impact on the population that resides on that economy as unemployment rates tend to rise, which translates into a lower standard of living for the economy's population. In addition, that economy's industry faces several setbacks that makes it difficult to revive after the crisis. Hence, all precautions need to be taken in order to avoid collapses of institutions that may eventually trigger a crisis. The paper aims to identify the commonalities that the major crises, in the past decade share with a focus on the leading indicators. The indicators that were shortlisted for this study were Reserve Bank's <b>Repurchase</b> <b>Rates,</b> debt levels of an economy and prices of commodities that may have a strong relationship to global economics; these include Gold, Copper, Iron-Ore and Crude oil. The validity of these indicators is then analyzed quantitatively using correlation tests followed by a qualitative analysis in order to understand the rationale behind the indicator's relation to the crisis. The study will then formulate a framework and provide recommendations to stakeholders and role-players within economies in order to mitigate the risks leading up to a crisis...|$|R

However, there is less agreement regarding repeatpurchasing effects. Promotion usage effects may exist in which <b>repurchase</b> <b>rates</b> are negativelyaffected by the fact that a promotion was used to make a purchase.

In orderto fulfill our purpose, we conducted a quantitative study with a deductive approach on thecustomers of Groupon Stockholm. The empirical findings of our study show that price, quality and service are important factors for repurchasing, while the location of a business has an indifferent role. We further conclude that the customers appear to be loyal to the online discount websites and respectively, the benefits gained from these websites rather than the local merchants and businesses. Thus, we round up this thesis by including various managerial implications with respect to the local merchant’s perspective and strategies of improving a relational customer relationship...|$|R

A case study provides empirical tests of the hypotheses, using data on about forty thousand sales transactions from a consumer electronics manufacturer’s cross-border online shop. The findings are that express delivery has positive effects on financial performance, as it leads to higher order incidence, larger order size, and higher repurchase rates in cross-border transactions.

40|$|The {{issue of}} the effects of {{monetary}} policy on prices and real economic activity lies at the core of macroeconomic theory and at the heart of monetary policy.

Changes in monetary policy are ‘propagated ’ throughout the economy via a transmission mechanism, commonly called the monetary transmission mechanism. This paper attempts to assess the channels through which monetary policy is transmitted in Jamaica since economic liberalisation.

50|$|Financial {{markets are}} unable to {{accurately}} gauge the meaning of repurchase announcements, because companies will often announce repurchases and then fail to complete them. <b>Repurchase</b> completion <b>rates</b> increased after companies were required to retroactively disclose their repurchase activity, {{the result of an}} effort to reduce the perceived or potential exploitation of public investors. Normally, investors have more of an adverse reaction to dividend cuts than postponing or even abandoning the share buyback program. So, rather than pay out larger dividends during periods of excess profitability then having to reduce them during leaner times, companies prefer to pay out a conservative portion of their earnings, perhaps half, with the aim of maintaining an acceptable level of dividend cover. Some evidence of this phenomenon for United States firms is provided by Alok Bhargava who found that higher dividend payments lower share repurchases though the converse is not true (Bhargava, 2010).|$|R
