25|$|Before {{a diving}} {{operation}} {{it is usually}} necessary {{to set up the}} surface supply equipment. There are a number of components which must be connected in the correct order, with checks at various stages to ensure that there are no leaks and everything functions correctly. Most diving contractors will have comprehensive checklists that are used to ensure that the equipment is connected in the appropriate sequence and all checks are done. Some checks are critical to the safety of the diver. The compressor must be set up so that it gets uncontaminated air to the intake. Filters should be checked in case they need to be changed. Air supply hoses will be connected to the air panel and checked for leaks, umbilicals connected to the panels and helmets, and the communications equipment connected and tested. Before the umbilical is connected to the helmet or full face mask, the umbilical should be blown through to ensure there is no dirt inside, and the non <b>return</b> <b>valve</b> on the bailout block must be given a function test. This is important, as it is there to prevent backflow of air up the umbilical if the line is cut, and if it fails the diver may suffer a helmet squeeze, or a neck dam flood.|$|E

50|$|The {{blow pipe}} is a short, conical wooden or bone tube {{in which the}} player blows to refill the bag. At {{the end of the}} blow pipe that is within the bag, there is a small <b>return</b> <b>valve</b> of leather or felt which allows air into the bag via the blow pipe but not back out. In some more {{primitive}} gaida there is no flap, but the player blocks returning air with his tongue during breaths.|$|E

50|$|Valve {{positions}} are operating conditions {{determined by the}} position of the disc or rotor in the valve.

This limits the dead space to between the non <b>return</b> <b>valves</b> and the user's mouth and/or nose. The additional dead space can be minimized by keeping the volume of this external dead space as small as possible, but this should not unduly increase work of breathing.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was {{the failure of the}} power flying control system. Plasma coating on the pistons of the power flying control system had flaked off and blocked the <b>return</b> <b>valve,</b> causing the aircraft to lose its maneuverability. It was revealed in 2007 that the failed component was inside a system that Copterline did not have the authority to service or even open. A periodic leak test that could have revealed the problem was omitted. Furthermore, the emergency floats failed to operate. The manufacturer, Sikorsky, confirmed that damages have been paid {{to the families of the}} casualties, but a court case between Copterline and Sikorsky is still pending.|$|E
50|$|Elvstr√∏m {{was also}} noted as a {{developer}} of sails and sailing equipment. One {{of his most}} successful innovations was {{a new type of}} self-bailer. The design is still in production under the Andersen brand and has been widely copied. The new features were a wedge shaped venturi that closes automatically if the boat grounds or hits an obstruction, and a flap that acts as a non <b>return</b> <b>valve</b> to minimise water coming in if the boat is stationary or moving too slowly for the device to work. Previous automatic bailers would be damaged or destroyed if they met an obstruction, and would let considerable amounts of water in if the boat was moving too slowly.|$|E
50|$|Known as the Papa pump, this utilises the low {{pressure}} generated by high velocity water flow around a curve-shaped elastomeric valve (with {{low pressure}} loss) {{to allow a}} valve design that enables rapid closure and with a relatively small cross sectional area and low weight. The venturi valve is configured as a ring section positioned around the supply inlet of the pump with the delivery outlet of the pump being directly in line. The design allowed the pump structure to be concentric and therefore inherently strong and upon closure of the valve, permits efficient water delivery by acting {{in line with the}} supply via a second smaller venturi effect delivery non <b>return</b> <b>valve.</b> The elastomeric material and operation of these valves also allows them to self-return without weight or spring assistance. A pressure vessel installed on a tee connected to the delivery port of the pump provides the pulsed flow accumulation means. This unique technology and design dramatically reduced the weight, manufacturing cost and number of components required - as well as provided an overall improvement in efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The simple {{case of a}} fixed ratio {{discharge}} can {{be achieved}} by concentric bellows counterlungs, where the exhaled gas expands both the counterlungs, and while the larger volume outer bellows discharges back to the loop when the diver inhales the next breath, the inner bellows discharges its contents to the surroundings, using non <b>return</b> <b>valves</b> to ensure a one-directional flow. The amount processed during each breath depends on the tidal volume of that breath.|$|R
25|$|In August 2007 it was {{announced}} that the cause of the crash was a failure of the hydraulic flight control system, caused by coating flaking off from servo pistons. The loosened plasma coating flakes blocked the <b>return</b> <b>valves</b> of the servos, causing the aircraft to abruptly lose its maneuverability. Copterline did not have the authority to service or even open these components. However, in the final report, Copterline was criticized for omitting a periodic leak test of the hydraulic flight control system that could have revealed the problem. The Finnish authorities were also criticized for insufficient supervision.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we compare}} the shuttle type passive control {{system and the}} {{existing}} technology in detail firstly, what is called passive control is a technology which the passive shuttle control system relies on the energy from the system itself or our natural cycle, such as the gravity flow, the pressure flow, the pressure difference to achieve self-regulation and control without other outside power and active devices. And then we introduce the new shuttle type control units including shuttle type <b>return</b> <b>valve,</b> shuttle-type exhaust and air-adding valve, and the adjustable difference flow pressure safeguard and their applications using several examples, which shows that the shuttle type control series valves are latest best choice for the modern pipeline conveying engineering with simple frame, lost cost and high reliability...|$|E
40|$|The {{reasons for}} the high oxygen {{mixtures}} delivered by the Bird Mark 7 ventilator were investigated by measuring the flow of gases through {{various parts of the}} ventilator. The major causes were the constant flow of 100 per cent oxygen from the nebulizer, the decrease and eventual cessation of flow through the venturi as the airway pressure rose, and the decrease in the proportion of entrained air at low flow settings. When the Bird Mark 7 automatic ventilator is driven by a source of compressed oxygen, an "air-mix " control permits the administration of either 100 per cent oxygen or a mixture of oxygen and air. This oxygen-air mixture is obtained when the oxygen passes through an injector, entraining air through a filter (fig. 1). The mixture then passes through a spring-loaded one-way valve into the righthand chamber of the ventilator and on to the patient via a length of wide-bore tubing. Before reaching the patient the mixture also passes through a humidifier and through a nebulizer to FIG. 1 Simplified diagram of the Bird Mark 7 ventilator.

40|$|International audienceLegionella pneumophila is {{frequently}} detected {{in hot water}} distribution systems and thermal control is a common measure implemented by health care facilities. A risk assessment based on water temperature profiling and temperature distribution within the network is proposed, to guide effective monitoring strategies and allow the identification of high risk areas. Temperature and heat loss at control points (water heater, recirculation, representative points-of-use) were monitored in various sections of five health care facilities hot water distribution systems and results used to develop a temperature-based risk assessment tool. Detailed investigations show that defective <b>return</b> <b>valves</b> in faucets can cause widespread temperature losses because of hot and cold water mixing. Systems in which water temperature {{coming out of the}} water heaters was kept consistently above 60 ¬†¬∞C and maintained above 55 ¬†¬∞C across the network were negative for Legionella by culture or qPCR. For systems not meeting these temperature criteria, risk areas for L. pneumophila were identified using temperature profiling and system's characterization; higher risk was confirmed by more frequent microbiological detection by culture and qPCR. Results confirmed that maintaining sufficiently high temperatures within hot water distribution systems suppressed L. pneumophila culturability. However, the risk remains as shown by the persistence of L. pneumophila by qPCR...|$|R
30|$|During the {{measurements}} of the pressure drops, {{the contribution of the}} static heat load to the cryogenic transfer lines is invariably present; the mass flow rate induced by the static heat load of the LHe supply line is thus essential for the corresponding computation. The pressure drops related to the 220 -m LHe and CGHe transfer lines are directly measurable with pressure transducers available in VB # 1 and VB # 2, indicated with diamond symbols in Fig.¬† 1. The Venturi-type flow meters (Forster and Graber 1996) are located at the CGHe return line upstream of both VB # 1 and VB # 2, as shown in Fig.¬† 1. The pressure transducers and Venturi-type flow meters on VB # 1 and VB # 2 and the electric power of a heater inside the LHe vessel of S 0 were well calibrated before measurement. On maintaining constant both the level and pressure of the LHe vessel of S 0 and varying the electric power of a heater inside the LHe vessel, both the total mass flow rate and the accumulated static heat load of the LHe supply line from MD # 1 to S 0, with static heat load of S 0 included, can be deduced from the differential pressure of the CGHe flow read from the Venturi-type flow meter with the technique developed; refer to Lin et al. (2013). The range of the applied heater power is limited by several operating parameters, such as the pressure of MD # 1, the pressure of S 0, the openings of the LHe valves at VB # 1 and of the CGHe valves at VB # 1, the speed of turbines in CB # 1 etc. The LHe supply valve directly after MD # 1, the valves inside the SVB, and the cold <b>return</b> <b>valve</b> of the CB # 1 are fixed openings. For every setting of a new heater power for S 0, the corresponding total mass flow rate and pressure drops of the 220 -m flexible cryogenic transfer lines are measured from the average readout of the Venturi-type flow meter at VB # 2 and of the pressure transducers at VB # 1 and VB # 2 after the system attains a new thermal equilibrium. The duration to achieve another equilibrium state is much greater than what is taken for the measurement.|$|E
