5|$|A {{more radical}} {{development}} was the synthesis in 2006 of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene by Bertrand's group. In this compound, which is stable at room temperature, the carbene atom {{is connected to}} two carbon atoms, in a three-member <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> retains the aromaticity and geometry of the cyclopropenylidene ring. This example demonstrated {{that the presence of}} heteroatoms next to the carbene is not necessary for stability, either.|$|E
40|$|We study {{periodic}} <b>rings</b> <b>that</b> are {{finitely generated}} as groups. We prove several structure results. We classify periodic <b>rings</b> <b>that</b> {{are free of}} rank at most 2, and also periodic <b>rings</b> R such <b>that</b> R is finitely generated as a group and R/t(R) ≃ℤ. In this way, we construct new classes of periodic rings. We also ask a question concerning the connection to periodic <b>rings</b> <b>that</b> are finitely generated as rings...|$|R
50|$|In {{commutative}} algebra, a G-ring or Grothendieck ring is a Noetherian <b>ring</b> such <b>that</b> {{the map of}} any of {{its local}} rings to the completion is regular (defined below). Almost all Noetherian <b>rings</b> <b>that</b> occur naturally in algebraic geometry or number theory are G-rings, and it is quite hard to construct examples of Noetherian <b>rings</b> <b>that</b> are not G-rings. The concept is named after Alexander Grothendieck.|$|R

5|$|Close {{examination}} of the inner region of the Andromeda Galaxy with the same telescope also showed a smaller dust <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> {{is believed to have}} been caused by the interaction with M32 more than 200 million years ago. Simulations show that the smaller galaxy passed through the disk of the Andromeda Galaxy along the latter's polar axis. This collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in Andromeda.|$|E
5|$|Frazier, however, {{searches}} the bank's records and finds that {{safe deposit box}} #392 has never appeared on any records since the bank's founding in 1948. He obtains a search warrant to open it. He is then confronted by White, who informs him of Case's Nazi dealings. She attempts to persuade Frazier to drop his investigation, but he refuses, playing a recording of an incriminating conversation that she had with him. White confronts Case who admits that the box contained diamonds and a <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> he had taken from a Jewish friend whom he had betrayed to the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|In Sir Thursday, {{readers are}} also {{introduced}} to the power issues that Arthur begins to struggle with – his natural compassion and desire for fairness and kindness, against the characteristics displayed by other senior denizens and Dame Primus, {{and the influence of}} the key. In addition, the idea of Arthur losing his mortality and becoming an immortal Denizen of the House, represented by the silver/gold crocodile <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> was introduced in Drowned Wednesday, is further explored, with Arthur often choosing to refrain from using the key – and the power it represents – to ensure he remains human.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>rings</b> <b>that</b> {{occur in}} {{algebraic}} geometry or number theory are J-2 rings, {{and in fact}} it is not trivial to construct any examples of <b>rings</b> <b>that</b> are not. In particular all excellent rings are J-2 rings; in fact {{this is part of the}} definition of an excellent ring.|$|R

40|$|Acenes and helicenes are {{molecules}} {{comprised of}} fused benzene <b>rings</b> <b>that</b> differ {{only in their}} connectivity. However, this seemingly trivial difference imparts these two classes of molecules with very distinctive properties. Acenes are comprised of linearly fused benzene rings, such as naphthalene ([2]acene) and anthracene ([3]acene). Helicenes are ortho-fused aromatic <b>rings</b> <b>that</b> adopt a helica...|$|R
5|$|In early 1970, Rymkus {{applied for}} a job as the Browns' {{offensive}} line coach but {{did not get the}} position. Later that year, he returned to the NFL as an offensive line coach for the Baltimore Colts under Don McCafferty. After just three regular-season games, however, he was replaced by George Young and transferred to the team's scouting department. Rymkus received a championship <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> year when the Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2007, along {{a remote}} shore of Lake Superior on the Keweenaw Peninsula, a Michigan family {{discovered}} a lone life-saving <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> {{appeared to have}} come from Fitzgerald. It bore markings different from those of rings found at the wreck site, and was thought to be a hoax. Later it was determined that the life ring was not from Fitzgerald, but had been lost by the owner, whose father had made it as a personal memorial.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of sirenians {{is characterized by}} the appearance of several traits, which are found in all sirenians (monophyly). The nostrils are large and retracted, the upper-jaw bone contacts the frontal bone, the sagittal crest is missing, the mastoid fills the supratemporal fenestra (an opening {{on the top of the}} skull), a drop-like ectotympanic (a bony <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> holds the ear drum), and pachyosteosclerotic (dense and bulky) bones.|$|E

It is irregularly shaped and reddish in colour, and is thought like Amalthea to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface features include large craters and high mountains—some of them are comparable to the size of the moon itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{search warrant}} {{executed}} on April 25, 2007, {{as part of}} a drug investigation of Vick's cousin Davon Boddie led to discovery of evidence of unlawful dog fighting activities at a property owned by Vick in rural Surry County in southeastern Virginia, with extensive facilities for the activity. Media attention quickly grew as state officials investigated, soon joined by federal authorities. As separate state and federal investigations progressed, more details emerged about an interstate dog-fighting <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> involved drugs and gambling. Gruesome details of abuse, torture, and execution of under-performing dogs galvanized animal rights activists and expressions of public outrage. Vick and several others were indicted on federal and Virginia state felony charges related to the operation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the events}} of Halo 3 (2007), the Flood {{intelligence}} known as the Gravemind infests and captures High Charity, while the Elites assist humans on Earth in defending themselves. Truth's forces excavate a portal to the Ark, located outside the Milky Way. The Elites follow Truth, and the Covenant Arbiter, or holy warrior, kills Truth ultimately ending the Covenant. After the Flood controlled High Charity arrives at the Ark, the Arbiter and Master Chief decide to activate a partially built Halo ring (the replacement for the <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> the Master Chief destroyed in the first game) destroying the Flood and sparing {{the rest of the}} galaxy. The remaining humans and Elites escape back through the portal. The Human-Covenant war ends in March 2553, and the Arbiter leads his Elites back to their homeworld.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Garridos arrived at their home in an unincorporated area in Contra Costa County, they had removed Dugard's clothing, leaving only a butterfly-shaped <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> she hid from them for the next 18 years. Taking her from their car onto their property, Garrido placed a blanket over Dugard's head and ushered her into an area of his {{backyard}} where sheds and storage units stood, placing her inside a tiny one that was soundproofed. After he finished raping {{her for the first}} time he left her naked in the structure, which he bolted shut, warning her that Doberman Pinschers were outside and trained to attack her if she tried to escape. Garrido would visit her in the structure, bringing her food and milkshakes, and talking to her.|$|E
5|$|Green Lantern is a 2011 American superhero film {{based on}} the DC Comics {{character}} of the same name. The film stars Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Peter Sarsgaard, Mark Strong, Angela Bassett and Tim Robbins, with Martin Campbell directing a script by Greg Berlanti and comic book writers Michael Green and Marc Guggenheim, which was subsequently rewritten by Michael Goldenberg. The film {{tells the story of}} Hal Jordan, a test pilot who is selected to become the first human member of the Green Lantern Corps. Hal is given a <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> grants him superpowers, and must confront Parallax, who threatens to upset {{the balance of power in}} the universe.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, Trend Micro threat {{researchers}} discovered templates for variations for the United States and Canada, {{suggesting that}} its authors {{may have been}} planning to target users in North America. By August 2012, a new variant of Reveton began to spread in the United States, claiming to require the payment of a $200 fine to the FBI using a MoneyPak card. In February 2013, a Russian citizen was arrested in Dubai by Spanish authorities for his connection to a crime <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> had been using Reveton; ten other individuals were arrested on money laundering charges. In August 2014, Avast Software reported that it had found new variants of Reveton that also distribute password stealing malware {{as part of its}} payload.|$|E

5|$|Janine tells Marsden that Ronnie has fled, but Marsden {{finds her}} at the Queen Vic. Marsden remarks that a new {{forensic}} profile has been found, and DNA screening of white males will shortly begin. After Hughes accepts a bribe from Jack to make the DNA samples disappear, Marsden receives an anonymous tip-off. The police search Janine's flat, finding the engagement <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> went missing the night of Archie's murder, and Janine is arrested but later released for lack of evidence. Becca Swanson (Simone James) calls the police, saying that Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) attacked Archie on Christmas Day, and the police arrive to arrest him. Marsden spots him when his phone rings; two officers chase him to the roof, where he stumbles and falls to his death. The investigation ends, since the police believe that Bradley had killed Archie; however, his killer was actually Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sophie's {{country is}} {{caught up in}} a war with a {{neighboring}} country. The King summons Howl to fight in the war; however, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King under the pretense of being his mother, to tell the king that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives to Sophie a charmed <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> connects her to Calcifer. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's advisor, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power, causing her to regress into a harmless old woman. Suliman says that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight; Sophie protests passionately in his defense, allowing Suliman to see Sophie's true form, and to realize that she has feelings for Howl. Howl arrives to rescue Sophie; Suliman tries to trap him, but with Sophie's help, they escape along with the former witch.|$|E
5|$|Suillus intermedius, {{found in}} northeastern and {{northern}} North America, {{is similar in}} appearance to S.salmonicolor. It may be distinguished by a lighter-colored cap, cream to yellowish or pale ochraceous flesh, and a <b>ring</b> <b>that</b> is neither as thick nor as wide as S.salmonicolor. It is also larger, with a cap diameter of up to , and its pore surface sometimes slowly stains reddish-brown when bruised. Although {{it has not been}} definitively established whether S.cothurnatus is a distinct species, several characteristics have been reported to differentiate it from S.salmonicolor: a thinner, less rubbery veil that usually lacks a thickened cottony roll at the base; glandular dots on the stem that consist of bundles of multiseptate hyphae in a parallel arrangement ending in an even row of large, sterile cystidia (60–140μm long) that resemble basidia; and small hyaline cystidia shaped like swollen bottles with narrowed bases. Other Suillus species with which S.salmonicolor might be confused include S.acidus and S.subalutaceus. Both of these species have a less well-developed partial veil, and their flesh is a duller tone lacking yellow-orange tints.|$|E
