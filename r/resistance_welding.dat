5|$|<b>Resistance</b> <b>welding</b> {{involves}} {{the generation of}} heat by passing current through the resistance caused by the contact between two or more metal surfaces. Small pools of molten metal are formed at the weld area as high current (1000–100,000 A) is passed through the metal. In general, <b>resistance</b> <b>welding</b> methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their applications are somewhat limited and the equipment cost can be high.|$|E
5|$|Electric <b>resistance</b> <b>welding</b> (ERW) – a {{welding process}} that {{produces}} coalescence of laying surfaces where heat {{to form the}} weld is generated by the electrical resistance of the material. In general, an efficient method, but limited to relatively thin material.|$|E
5|$|Like spot welding, {{seam welding}} relies on two {{electrodes}} to apply pressure and current to join metal sheets. However, instead of pointed electrodes, wheel-shaped electrodes roll along and often feed the workpiece, {{making it possible}} to make long continuous welds. In the past, this process was used in the manufacture of beverage cans, but now its uses are more limited. Other <b>resistance</b> <b>welding</b> methods include butt welding, flash welding, projection welding, and upset welding.|$|E

5|$|Spot welding is {{a popular}} <b>resistance</b> <b>welding</b> method used to join {{overlapping}} metal sheets of up to 3mm thick. Two electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. The advantages of the method include efficient energy use, limited workpiece deformation, high production rates, easy automation, and no required filler materials. Weld strength is significantly lower than with other welding methods, making the process suitable for only certain applications. It is used extensively in the automotive industry—ordinary cars can have several thousand spot welds made by industrial robots. A specialized process, called shot welding, {{can be used to}} spot weld stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} welding process, forge welding, some modern welding methods {{do not involve}} the melting of the {{materials}} being joined. One of the most popular, ultrasonic welding, is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure. The equipment and methods involved are {{similar to that of}} <b>resistance</b> <b>welding,</b> but instead of electric current, vibration provides energy input. Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure. When welding plastics, the materials should have similar melting temperatures, and the vibrations are introduced vertically. Ultrasonic welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.|$|E
5|$|<b>Resistance</b> <b>welding</b> {{was also}} {{developed}} during the final decades of the 19th century, with the first patents going to Elihu Thomson in 1885, who produced further advances over the next 15 years. Thermite welding was invented in 1893, and around that time another process, oxyfuel welding, became well established. Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy, but its use was not practical in welding until about 1900, when a suitable torch was developed. At first, oxyfuel welding {{was one of the}} more popular welding methods due to its portability and relatively low cost. As the 20th century progressed, however, it fell out of favor for industrial applications. It was largely replaced with arc welding, as advances in metal coverings (known as flux) were made. Flux covering the electrode primarily shields the base material from impurities, but also stabilizes the arc and can add alloying components to the weld metal.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The welding lobes of AC <b>resistance</b> spot <b>welding</b> and {{inverter}} DC <b>resistance</b> spot <b>welding</b> for the {{magnesium alloy}} sheet AZ 31 were compared and analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Using the welding lobe {{in terms of}} electrode force, weld time, and weld current which are process variables of the <b>resistance</b> spot <b>welding,</b> optimal welding conditions were determined. The lower limit {{of the range of}} the optimal welding condition was decided by minimum shear tension strength for the magnesium alloy sheet AZ 31, and the upper limit was decided by whether an expulsion occurs or not. Findings: It was found that the range of the optimal welding condition of the inverter DC <b>resistance</b> spot <b>welding</b> was larger than the AC <b>resistance</b> spot <b>welding</b> and that the nugget width of inverter type <b>resistance</b> spot <b>welding</b> was larger in the same welding condition.

Practical implications: In this study, by comparing the range of the acceptable welding condition of the <b>resistance</b> spot <b>welding</b> between AC type and inverter DC type power supplies, the effect of the types of power supplies on welding lobes could be confirmed.

5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the only}} welding process was forge welding, which blacksmiths had used for millenia to join iron and steel by heating and hammering. Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first {{processes}} to develop late in the century, and electric <b>resistance</b> <b>welding</b> followed soon after. Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like SMAW, now {{one of the most popular}} welding methods, as well as semi-automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW, SAW, FCAW and ESW. Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding, electron beam welding, magnetic pulse welding (MPW), and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century. Today, the science continues to advance. Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings, and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality.|$|E
5|$|While many welding {{applications}} {{are done in}} controlled environments such as factories and repair shops, some welding processes are commonly used {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, such as open air, underwater, and vacuums (such as space). In open-air applications, such as construction and outdoors repair, shielded metal arc welding is the most common process. Processes that employ inert gases to protect the weld cannot be readily used in such situations, because unpredictable atmospheric movements can result in a faulty weld. Shielded metal arc welding is also often used in underwater welding in the construction and repair of ships, offshore platforms, and pipelines, but others, such as flux cored arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding, are also common. Welding in space is also possible—it was first attempted in 1969 by Russian cosmonauts, when they performed experiments to test shielded metal arc welding, plasma arc welding, and electron beam welding in a depressurized environment. Further testing of these methods was done in the following decades, and today researchers continue to develop methods for using other welding processes in space, such as laser beam welding, <b>resistance</b> <b>welding,</b> and friction welding. Advances in these areas may be useful for future endeavours similar to the construction of the International Space Station, which could rely on welding for joining in space the parts that were manufactured on Earth.|$|E

In 1970, the low frequency process was superseded by a high frequency ERW process which produced a higher quality weld.|$|R

50|$|The depth {{that the}} currents, and {{therefore}} heating, penetrates {{from the surface}} is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency.

50|$|<b>Resistance</b> <b>welding</b> is done {{using two}} {{electrode}}s. Each electrode comes {{into contact with}} one of the pieces being welded. The two pieces of metal are then pressed together between the electrodes. While they are being pressed an electric current is ran through them.

The current is passed through the metal until it is hot enough {{to the point where the}} two pieces melt and conjoin. As the metal cools the bond is solidified. This process requires large amounts of electricity.
