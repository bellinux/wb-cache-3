50|$|<b>Regrelor</b> is {{structurally}} {{similar to}} AMP, just like ticagrelor. <b>Regrelor</b> has 4 hydrogen bond donors and 11 acceptors. It is produced as a disodium salt. The two sodium atoms bind the negatively charged phosphate moiety in solution.|$|E
50|$|<b>Regrelor</b> was {{synthesized}} from {{adenosine diphosphate}} (ADP), an endogenous chemical involved in metabolism. The authors {{noted that the}} addition of a lipophilic moiety like cinnamaldehyde at the C-2' and C-3' positions, combined with ethylurea at N-6 on the adenine base, yielded <b>regrelor.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Regrelor</b> is {{available}} in an intravenous formulation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Regrelor's</b> primary {{metabolite}} {{is called}} INS51088.|$|R
50|$|In a phase 1 {{clinical}} trial sponsored by Merck Sharp and Dohme Corporation, <b>regrelor</b> was well-tolerated in healthy volunteers. In 2008, phase 2 trials were discontinued. It {{is believed that}} further development of the drug was ceased due to safety reasons. In the trial, there was {{an increased risk of}} bleeding for patients on <b>regrelor.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Regrelor</b> was {{developed}} {{around the same}} time as prasugrel and cangrelor. After Inspire Pharmaceuticals initially developed the drug, it was purchased by Merck Sharp and Dohme.|$|E
50|$|<b>Regrelor</b> is an {{experimental}} drug. It {{is classified as}} an antiplatelet medication. It was under investigation for use in blood clotting problems, as well as during coronary artery bypass surgery.|$|E
50|$|Inhibitors of the {{receptor}} subtype P2Y12 are {{one class}} of P2Y receptor inhibitors. These drugs include clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticlopidine, ticagrelor, cangrelor, <b>regrelor,</b> and elinogrel.These inhibitors prevent expression of glycoproteins IIb/IIIa on the platelet surface.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Regrelor</b> (also {{known as}} INS50589) is an {{experimental}} antiplatelet drug that was {{under investigation by}} Merck Sharp and Dohme in human clinical trials. Although it was initially found to be well-tolerated in healthy subjects, safety concerns lead to cessation of clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|<b>Regrelor</b> is {{classified}} as an purinergic P2 receptor (P2Y12) antagonist. Other compounds in the same mechanistic class include clopidogrel and ticagrelor. It is characterized as a reversible, competitive receptor antagonist. The IC50 for antagonism of ADP-induced (P2Y12-mediated) platelet aggregation was 16 nM in vitro.|$|E
