At the hospital, female residents where habitually inhibited in their responsibilities by being restricted to less critical cases and being excluded from involvement in casualty duty. Campbell and Macnamara decided that they needed more experience and exposure in child and maternal health and so decided on moving to the Royal Children's Hospital where they {{became one of the}} first few female <b>resident</b> <b>medical</b> <b>staff.</b> However, initially the Children's Hospital had been claiming to lack the facilities needed to accommodate the female doctors. It was only until (Sir) William Upjohn pleaded Campbell and Macnamara's special case with the hospital's board that they received the positions. In future years, Upjohn boasted [...] "that his entry to heaven was assured by the fact that he got Jean Macnamara and Kate Campbell on at the Children's". It was stated by the Australian Dictionary of Biography that it was while holding a two-year-old girl's hand at the Children's Hospital that Campbell realised she wanted to specialise in children's health.|$|E

50|$|Another such {{demonstration}} of the expertise of Schmidlin and witnessed by prominent medical men of the day, was recorded in the 22 August 1896 issue of The Town and Country Journal.The Rontgen Rays. Successful Use at Sydney Hospital.A series of interesting experiments with the Rontgen rays were completed at Sydney Hospital {{on the afternoon of}} August 14 by Mr. Schmidlin, electrician of Elizabeth - street. Under a 6 in Rumkorff induction coil and a Crookes focus tube previously exhausted, he photographed, or more properly speaking, shadowgraphed the bullet wound {{on the inside of the}} right thigh of Frederick Atcheson, the victim of the Tilpa shooting case. Mr. Schmidlin used extra rapid full plates, and allowed half an hour exposure in each case. The plate, wrapped in specially prepared silk and paper to protect it against the natural light, was placed immediately beneath the patient’s leg on the opposite side to the wound. Then the wound itself was laid bare, and with the patient stretched at full length in bed, and perfectly at ease, the fluorescent rays were flashed intermittently, and a splendid shadowgraph picture was the result. The bones of the leg were clearly defined, and the bullet itself equally so. A second exposure from a slightly different position was afterwards taken with another full plate for the purpose of showing the exact angle of the embedded bullet. Atcheson was placed under chloroform, and Dr. Bowker cut into the wound and removed the bullet with ease. The patient, said the doctors present, is necessarily subject to the usual dangers arising from surgery, but as an operation, success was complete and emphatic. Those who witnessed the removal were Drs. McCormick, Goode, Chisholm, Binnie (medical superintendent of Sydney Hospital) and others, including the <b>resident</b> <b>medical</b> <b>staff</b> of the institution. - The Town and Country Journal.|$|E
40|$|The {{current issue}} of the journal {{contains}} an extremely useful study by Farhan Amin and colleagues entitled “An audit of information provided during pre-operative informed con-sent ” which highlights the practice of obtain-ing informed consent in our public healthcare facilities. The authors have concluded that the practice is below international standard and ethical acceptability. The quality of informed consent can be improved by increasing aware-ness regarding ethical issues and educating the healthcare professionals regarding patient’s rights. Patients have a right to fully participate in the decision regarding their treatment but what goes on in most of our hospitals is just a for-mality wherein the patients or their relatives are asked to put in their thumb impression or signature. They are seldom provided the de-tailed information simply because the treating physicians are too busy and have no time. Not only that it is usually the technicians, nursing staff or paramedics who carry these papers to the patients for thumb impression/signature.

40|$|Several factors {{complicate the}} {{attainment}} of expertise in clinical communication. Medical curricula and postgraduate training insufficiently provide the required learning conditions of deliberate practice to overcome these obstacles. In this paper we provide recommendations for learning objectives and teaching methods for {{the attainment of}} professional expertise in patient education. Firstly, we propose to use functional learning objectives derived from the goals and strategies of clinical communication. Secondly, we recommend using teaching and assessment methods which: (1) contain stimulating learning tasks with opportunities for immediate feedback, reflection and corrections, and (2) give ample opportunity for repetition, gradual refinements and practice in challenging situations. Video-on-the-job fits these requirements {{and can be used}} to improve the competency in patient education of <b>residents</b> and <b>medical</b> <b>staff</b> in clinical practice. However, video-on-the-job can only be successful if the working environment supports the teaching and learning of communication and if <b>medical</b> <b>staff</b> which supervises the residents, is motivated to improve their own communication and didactic skills.

It may be combined with fecal screening for occult blood loss, and annual performance has been recommended for asymptomatic individuals over age 40 years for cancer screening. In this study, documentation of digital rectal examinations was assessed through a review of hospital medical records of a randomly selected group of 100 patient discharges (55 females and 45 males) from a total of 896 patients admitted through a hospital emergency room to a medical clinical teaching inpatient unit of a university hospital during a six-month period. In this group, 26 % were admitted for a gastrointestinal disorder, but only 17 % of all hospitalized patients had rectal examinations done by the <b>medical</b> <b>resident</b> house <b>staff</b> and/or attending <b>medical</b> <b>staff</b> directly responsible for the care of these patients. Occult blood testing was done in 15 patients. Pelvic and breast examinations were rarely documented. The majority of rectal examinations (ie, 13 of 17) were ’same sex’ examinations, appeared to be used largely for testing or confirmation of grossly visible blood loss and were never confirmed by attending staff. The presence or absence of nursing staff during examinations was not documented. The prostate examination was normal in one patient but not documented in the other 44 males (ie, 26 patients over age 60 years).

We performed a cross-sectional survey of <b>residents,</b> <b>medical</b> students and <b>staffs</b> using a convenience sample. Methods: A 33 -item survey was developed with the assistance of a pilot study and two focus groups. Our participants were from four different educational wards including Surgery, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics and Obstetrics & Gynecology. Results: 78 % of the respondents stated that morning report sessions motivated them for self-directed learning and 70. 3 % of respondents stated that the format of morning report is good. 57. 6 % of respondents stated that discussed cases in the morning report are varied, 80 % of the respondents experienced lack of appropriate feedback. 56. 8 % of the respondents stated discussion about the case results in better management of the patient, 39 % stated that morning report results in resolving diagnosis problems. 50 % of the respondents stated that there are enough communions between attending physician and student. There was not any significant difference between answers of <b>residents,</b> <b>medical</b> students and faculty members. We found considerable non-performance in attends (?) performance in running morning report sessions.

40|$|Background The Clinical Team Coordinator (CTC) is {{a senior}} {{experienced}} nurse from the Emergency Department (ED) that provides an after-hours clinical supervision and liaison service for the entire hospital. The role guides and supports nursing and junior <b>medical</b> <b>staff</b> regarding clinical and hospital procedures, protocols and individual patient problems and assists with clinical issues on the wards such as patient assessment and management. Method Following a qualitative evaluation of the CTC role in 2009, the scope of activity and impact on clinical services after hours was established through shift data collation and analysis during the calendar year 2011. Results In 2011, the CTC was directly involved with 18, 165 occasions of care across the evening and night shift periods, with only one third of these calls requiring <b>Resident</b> <b>Medical</b> Officer (RMO) attention.

40|$|Purpose of the study: In our {{experience}} {{most of the}} <b>residents</b> and <b>medical</b> <b>staff</b> members in children hospitals are inadequately prepared to perform resuscitation according to the 5 ERC 6 guidelines. In order to improve the management of pediatric emergencies we started a novel mandatory training program including high-fidelity simulation 5 PALS 6 training. Due to limited financial resources we developed a low-cost high-fidelity simulator. Materials and methods: In cooperation with the University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg we developed a new high-fidelity simulator {{for any kind of}} manikin. Beside heart rate and 5 ECG 6 we needed authentic simulation of blood pressure and oxygen saturation. In order to raise the level of authenticity we developed a system which can be plugged into any clinical monitoring systems. All relevant vital parameters can be seen by the participants on "their monitors" and can be changed online by the instructors. Using this novel simulator we trained 62 participants in 2009 in Pediatric Advanced Life Support. Results: Confidence score before the courses for all skills was 3. 3 +/- 0. 6 (scale 1 - 6). 34 % of all participants attendedatleast 5 5 ormoreCPAresuscitation. 6 Tomostof the participants our novel high-fidelity simulator was authentic (1. 8 +/- 0. 3, scale 1 - 6). After the training confidence score raised to 1. 6 +/- 0. 4 (scale 1 - 6). Participants welcomed the novel training program as very useful and necessary (1. 1 +/- 0. 3, scale 1 - 6). Conclusions: Our self constructed high fidelity simulation program shows no lack of authenticityin different simulation of pediatric emergencies.
