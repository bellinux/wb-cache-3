5|$|Although oxygen once {{promoted}} {{nitrogen fixation}} by making molybdenum available in water, it also directly poisons nitrogenase enzymes. Thus, in Earth's ancient history, after oxygen arrived {{in large quantities}} in Earth's air and water, organisms that continued to fix nitrogen in aerobic conditions isolated and protected their nitrogen-fixing enzymes from too much oxygen in heterocysts or equivalent structures. This structural isolation of nitrogen fixation <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> aerobic organisms continues to the present.|$|E

In general, morels should not be eaten raw, as they can trigger allergic <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> susceptible individuals. Their flavor is enhanced after they are fried, stuffed, or dried.|$|E
5|$|Electrons {{are thought}} {{to exist in the}} Universe since early stages of the Big Bang.

5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical <b>reactions,</b> <b>in</b> particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E

50|$|N-Acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase {{also known}} as ASMT is an enzyme that catalyzes the final <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> {{melatonin}} biosynthesis, converting Normelatonin to melatonin.

5|$|Mainly nocturnal M. nigriceps {{is found}} in hot hilly areas and woodland, nesting {{underground}} in mounds. The ant's diet consists of sweet liquids from flowering plants and invertebrate prey, which are fed to the carnivorous larvae. Spiders are known to eat these ants, and echidnas consume the larvae and pupae. Like other Myrmecia species, M. nigriceps ants possess a powerful and painful sting, and the venom is capable of inducing allergic <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> sensitive people.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen analogues of the Nazarov {{cyclization}} reaction (known as imino-Nazarov cyclization reactions) {{have few}} instances; {{there is one}} example of a generalized imino-Nazarov cyclization reported (shown below), and several iso-imino-Nazarov <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> the literature. Even these tend to suffer from poor stereoselectivity, poor yields, or narrow scope. The difficulty stems from the relative over-stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation, impeding cyclization.|$|E

In the 1970s, there was a claim on synthesis of a mercury(III) compound, but it is now thought to be false.|$|E
500|$|As {{with all}} catalysts, enzymes do {{not alter the}} {{position}} of the chemical equilibrium of the <b>reaction.</b> <b>In</b> the presence of an enzyme, the <b>reaction</b> runs <b>in</b> the same direction as it would without the enzyme, just more quickly.

5|$|The Wells {{ideas and}} attitudes now strike many readers as dated, and few critics praise its {{literary}} quality.

5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic {{than that}} of A. contortrix, and is rich with {{powerful}} cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, the bite can leave scars, and on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom does not cause systemic <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> victims and does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).|$|E
50|$|The Mislow-Evans {{rearrangement}} {{is a name}} <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> organic chemistry. It {{is named}} after Kurt Mislow and David A.

5|$|Another {{chemical}} {{of interest}} found in P.indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural, which has attracted attention as a tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of melanogenesis in mammals, and {{is responsible for}} the undesirable browning <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> damaged fruits during post-harvest handling and processing, and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs naturally in several foods, is not associated with serious health risks. P.indusiatus also contains a unique ribonuclease (an enzyme that cuts RNA into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{exhibit a}} great variety of {{chemical}} <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These reactions are classified into nutritional groups, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are lithotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor. The energy released is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through chemiosmosis, the same basic process that happens in the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated {{in people with}} myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical <b>reactions.</b> <b>In</b> major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history of}} alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.|$|E

50|$|Isocitrate {{dehydrogenase}} is {{a critical}} enzyme in the citric acid cycle. Mutated forms of IDH produce high levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate and {{can contribute to the}} growth of tumors.

5|$|Curium is {{produced}} in small quantities in nuclear reactors, and by now only kilograms of it have been accumulated for the 242Cm and 244Cm and grams or even milligrams for heavier isotopes. This explains {{the high price of}} curium, which has been quoted at 160–185 USD per milligram, with a more recent estimate at 2,000 USD/g for 242Cm and 170 USD/g for 244Cm. In nuclear reactors, curium is formed from 238U in a series of nuclear <b>reactions.</b> <b>In</b> the first chain, 238U captures a neutron and converts into 239U, which via β− decay transforms into 239Np and 239Pu.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} period {{he worked as a}} pathology registrar at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the agglutinin <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> typhoid fever, leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the antibody response in typhoid, even though he was technically supposed to pursuing pathology as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first in the Doctor of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would not fail for being so far behind.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} is {{the investigation}} of how enzymes bind substrates {{and turn them into}} products. The rate data used in kinetic analyses are commonly obtained from enzyme assays. In 1913 Leonor Michaelis and Maud Leonora Menten proposed a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, which is referred to as Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The major contribution of Michaelis and Menten was to think of enzyme <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> two stages. In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis-Menten complex in their honor. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. This work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely used today.|$|E
