At last he {{found what he}} wanted. Two beech-trees {{side by side on}} the hill held a little level on the upper face between their roots. It was littered with damp leaves, but it would do. The fishermen were perhaps sufficiently out of sight. He threw down his <b>rainproof</b> and waved to her to come.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{they had}} gone, the whole band of them, {{not less than}} thirty or forty men, so I went also, back to the cart where I found the others very {{comfortable}} indeed beneath the <b>rainproof</b> tilt. Saying nothing of what had happened, of which they were as innocent as babes, I took a stiff tot of brandy, for I was chilled through by the wet, and {{while waiting for the}} moon to rise, busied myself with getting the bits back into the horses' mouths--an awkward job in the dark. At length it appeared in a clear sky, for the storm had quite departed and the rain ceased. As soon as there was light enough I took the near leader by the bridle and led the cart to the brow of the hill, which was not easy under the conditions, making Kaatje follow with my horse.|$|E
60|$|When I {{reached the}} rock I {{was pleased to}} find Marama and about twenty of his people engaged in {{erecting}} the house that we had ordered them to build for our accommodation. Indeed, it was nearly finished, since house-building in Orofena is a simple business. The framework of poles let into palm trunks, since {{they could not be}} driven into the rock, had been put together on the further shore and towed over bodily by canoes. The overhanging rock formed one side of the house; the ends were of palm leaves tied to the poles, and the roof was of the same material. The other side was left open for the present, which in that equable and balmy clime was no disadvantage. The whole edifice was about thirty feet long by fifteen deep and divided into two portions, one for sleeping and one for living, by a palm leaf partition. Really, it was quite a comfortable abode, cool and <b>rainproof,</b> especially after Bastin had built his hut in which to cook.|$|E

5000|$|The {{historical}} development of Nepalese handicraft industry is very old although has its rise and falls. According to the reference found in Kautilya's Economics about various productions and exports from Nepal, {{during the time}} of Chandra Gupta Mouriya, in fourth century, Nepal was known for quality <b>rainproof</b> woollen blankets. The blankets were made of eight pieces joined together of black colour known as [...] "bhiringisi" [...] as well as [...] "apasaraka". Similarly the good quality blankets are mentioned in the epics of Jain religion [...] "Brihatakalpasutra Vhashya". Various famous Chinese travellers like Wanghunshe and Huansang in 648 AD have appreciated Nepalese arts and crafts and the skills of Nepalese craftsmen and artisans in their travelogues.|$|E

The charges were for conspiring to send money and military gear to al Qaeda associates in Pakistan. They were for conspiracy because Hashmi did not provide the material support himself. Rather, Hashmi allowed an acquaintance from New York, Junaid Babar, to stay in his apartment for two weeks and that Babar brought military gear {{with him in a}} suitcase and later gave the gear to al Qaeda. The items being labeled as [...] "military gear" [...] were socks and <b>rainproof</b> ponchos. His arrest is based on the testimony of Babar, who was apprehended and then turned informant in a successful attempt to get a reduction in his own 70-year prison sentence.|$|E
5000|$|In later centuries, {{and there}} are {{numerous}} examples in Sussex and the surrounding counties of its use as a roofing material, particularly for mills, dovecotes, churches, manor houses and similar buildings. Completely <b>rainproof</b> and long-lasting, it was ideal for these structures. [...] Smaller-scale uses include road surfaces, for which the thickest slabs were typically used; the footpaths leading to St Mary's Church, Shipley, West Sussex and the north wall of St Nicholas' Church, Itchingfield, West Sussex; and for gravestones, fonts and tombs (of which there are several examples at St Mary the Virgin's Church, Horsham). Once exposed it hardens quickly and will last for hundreds of years. The characteristic ripple marks are retained. There are numerous old quarry workings throughout Sussex but just one working quarry in 2009. Large quarries at Nuthurst and Stammerham (near Christ's Hospital) school are no longer extant, but others survive in isolated Wealden settings.|$|E
5000|$|Many objects traded were {{valued for}} their functionality: {{clothing}} woven of grass, harpoon tips carved from the ivory tusk of the walrus; <b>rainproof</b> outerwear sewn from membranes in the intestines of seals; and animal skins valued for their warmth and durability. Gradually, {{these items were}} refined to be more decorative, {{as a way to}} increase their value in trade. For example, a walrus tusk might be etched with many hunting scenes depicting life of the coastal people; later, this technique would {{come to be known as}} [...] "scrimshaw" [...] when brought back to New England on whaling ships. Elaborate patterns in beadwork were designed as the beads themselves arrived through trade; Regalia of all types used for ceremonial purposes - masks, woven clothing, hats, dance fans - all became souvenirs for the whalers and explorers of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Even the towering totem poles from Southeastern Alaska found their way back to the East Coast of the United States, where they formed the basis of many museum collections.|$|E
50|$|The bumpers on the 1933 Series 355C were sectioned, with plain {{ends and}} a three bar center. The grille was made V-shaped and blended into the painted (chrome optional) {{radiator}} shell. The radiator cap disappeared {{under the hood}} {{on the right side}} (same side as the oil level gauge). The fender tie bar, after a year's absence was sectioned and the center section was hidden behind the grille. Six horizontal doors replaced the vertical hood doors. Skirts were added to the front and rear fenders. The most significant change in body detail was the introduction of no-draft Individually Controlled Ventilation (ICV) or pivoting vent windows in the front doors and the rear quarter or rear door windows. In early production the front door window had to be lowered to disengage the channel at its front edge from the vent window to allow the vent window to pivot. In later production the sealing channel was attached to the door frame rather than to the window glass so that the vent window could be operated independently of the window glass. Windshield and rear quarter windows were made stationary. Absence of a windshield operating mechanism on the closed car allowed room to conceal the wiper motor behind the headboard. The cowl ventilator was baffled and drained {{in such a way as}} to be <b>rainproof.</b> Chassis changes were few and minor in nature. Controlled free wheeling was discontinued. Vacuum assist was added to the brake system. Changes in shock absorber valves extended the range of the ride control system. During the model year the dual point four lobe distributor was replaced by a single point eight lobe unit. A radio was optional. Model year sales were 2,100.|$|E
40|$|Dealing {{with the}} issue of urban storm water {{flooding}} is becoming increasingly urgent. In the Netherlands there are no clear guidelines on the level of acceptance of urban flooding. Based on an accurate DEM, a detailed quick scan tool has been used to assess an extreme storm event in Amsterdam. The resulting flood maps for the whole of the city show where flooding is likely to occur after 60 or 100 mm of rain in one hour, as well as which buildings are at risk. Based on the results from this mapping study, Amsterdam decided to start a program to make the city <b>rainproof</b> (Amsterdam <b>Rainproof).</b> Part of the program was the validation of the model based on field research. An example of this is the use of data from the extreme storm event that occurred in Amsterdam on 28 july 2014.

40|$|The expense, {{unreliability}} or unavailability of {{fuel and}} electricity in many areas hampers the ability of medical facilities to autoclave implements and supplies. This paper describes the adaptation of a large, simple, lowcost panel cooker to greatly reduce the reliance on conventional heat sources. The hybrid apparatus integrates propane for backup in case the available sunlight is insufficient. In good sunlight, sterilization runs can be completed on solar power alone. The efficient design also reduces fuel use even when no sunlight is available. The concept and operating guidelines for practical clinical use draw on the principal author’s experience as a surgical nurse. Described are the principles of operation, design, construction and experimental results for a prototype unit – including verification of sterilization. The apparatus is also highly effective for general cooking, pressure-cooking and pressure food preservation (“canning”). The wind and <b>rainproof</b> design allows efficient and reliable operation under all weather conditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} three experiments {{conducted in}} Jiangxi, China, aimed at understanding {{the performance of}} rice under different water management practices. Experiment 1 {{was carried out in}} <b>rainproof</b> containers to study the response of different varieties (Sanyou 10 and 923 and Zhensan 97 B) to three water treatments (flooded, intermittent irrigation, and dry cultivation). Calculated grain yields in the dry-cultivation treatment amounted to 6. 3, 6. 0, and 3. 7 t ha– 1 for the varieties Sanyou 10 and 923 and Zhensan 97 B, respec-tively. Under intermittent irrigation, yields of Sanyou 10 and 923 were 8 % and 10 % higher, 9. 5 and 8. 8 t ha– 1, respectively, than under flooded condi-tions. The highest yield of Zhensan 97 B (5. 3 t ha– 1) was obtained under flooded conditions. Experiment 2, a root-box experiment with different soil water tables, revealed that the treatment with a water table 5 cm below the soil surface produced relatively more roots in the lower soil layers (40 – 45 cm) than the flooded treatment. Experiment 3 consisted of two field demon-stration trials, each with flooded and intermittent irrigation. It turned out tha...|$|E
40|$|Providing bird {{houses and}} shelves {{can be a}} fun and {{rewarding}} part of a wildlife program. It doesn 2 ̆ 7 t matter where you live - in an apartment, townhouse, or single family dwelling in a town, a suburb, or the country, you can attract birds by providing the proper nesting structure. Birds such as black-capped chickadees, purple martins, or bluebirds are cavity nesters and can benefit from bird houses. Other birds like the American robin and the barn swallow will use open nesting structures. A well-built house that is durable, <b>rainproof,</b> cool, and easy to clean can add to the attractiveness of your property. Knowing when not to disturb nesting birds is important. Avoid disturbing nest boxes at night and during rainy or windy weather, because under these conditions, frightening the adult birds away could result in chilled eggs or nestlings. Also, avoid checking boxes {{during the first few}} days of incubation, in the morning when females are laying eggs, and when young are close to fledging. Adults may abandon nests and nearly-fledged young could leave the nest prematurely. Observe the box for a moment. If you don 2 ̆ 7 t see or hear any birds, tap on the box. Take a quick peek inside. If everything is okay, close the box, and leave the area. If you see problems (parasites; predators; or unwanted occupants such as wasps, ants, or mice), remove them using appropriate caution, close the box, and leave the area. Keep a record of your bird house contents to better judge when the young may fledge...|$|E
