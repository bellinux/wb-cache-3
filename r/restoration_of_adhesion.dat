40|$|Abstract. Magnetic pulsed {{compaction}} {{method has}} been applied to compact the spinel-based (LiMn 2 O 4, Li 4 Ti 5 O 12) foil electrodes. The compressibility of the spinel nanopowders (LiMn 2 O 4 and Li 4 Ti 5 O 12) with combined additive of graphite, carbon black and polyvinyl difluoride has been studied. The structures of the spinel materials under action of pulsed pressures up to 1. 6 GPa have been investigated with X-ray and AFM. It was found that pulsed compaction diminishes the adhesion strength of electrode coatings with Al foil. But the annealing of the coatings at temperatures up to 220 °C after pulsed compaction leads to the partial <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> strength...|$|E
40|$|Heparins {{represent}} an efficient treatment of acute thrombosis and obstetric compli-cations in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Enhanced microvesiculation of cell mem-branes, as detected by reduced membrane adhesion, {{can contribute to}} hypercoagu-lability in APS. Healthy donor IgG antibodies significantly increased β 2 -glycoprotein I (β 2 -GPI) -induced membrane adhesion, indicating that IgG antibodies might supple-ment the role of β 2 -GPI in the regulation of membrane microvesiculation in healthy in-dividuals. Anti-β 2 -GPI IgG antibodies significantly reduced β 2 -GPI-induced membrane adhesion, suggesting a direct role of anti-β 2 -GPI antibodies in enhancingmembranemi-crovesiculation in APS. Therapeutic concentration of nadroparin completely restored β 2 -GPI-induced membrane adhesion {{in the presence of}} anti-β 2 -GPI IgG antibodies. A novel anticoagulant mechanism of nadroparin in APS is suggested that supplements its direct effect on the coagulation cascade. <b>Restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> between negatively charged membranes in the presence of nadroparin might decrease shedding of mi-crovesicles into the surrounding solution and could thus contribute to the efficacy of heparin treatment in APS.

40|$|The high {{mortality}} of Plasmodium falciparum malaria {{is the result}} of a parasite ligand, PfEMP 1 (P. falciparum) erythrocyte membrane protein 1), on the surface of infected red blood cells (IRBCs), which adheres to the vascular endothelium and causes the sequestration of IRBCs in the microvasculature. PfEMP 1 transport to the IRBC surface involves Maurer's clefts, which are parasite-derived membranous structures in the IRBC cytoplasm. Targeted gene disruption of a Maurer's cleft protein, SBP 1 (skeleton-binding protein 1), prevented IRBC adhesion because of the loss of PfEMP 1 expression on the IRBC surface. PfEMP 1 was still present in Maurer's clefts, and the transport and localization of several other Maurer's cleft proteins were unchanged. Maurer's clefts were altered in appearance and were no longer found as close to the periphery of the IRBC. Complementation of mutant parasites with sbp 1 led to the reappearance of PfEMP 1 on the IRBC surface and the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion.</b> Our results demonstrate that SBP 1 is essential for the translocation of PfEMP 1 onto the surface of IRBCs and is likely to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of P. falciparum malaria...|$|E

40|$|<b>Adhesion</b> {{properties}} <b>of</b> polymer coatings on metals are {{of great}} interest in various industrial applications, including packaging of food and drinks. Particular interest is focused on polymer-metal interfaces that are subjected to significant deformations during manufacturing process. In this work steel samples laminated with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were subjected to uniaxial tensile deformations followed by annealing treatments. The measurements have demonstrated degradation <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> <b>of</b> the metal-polymer interface as the strain introduced by the deformation increased. Moreover, {{it was observed that}} within the geometry used in the experiments tensile deformations of the metal substrate introduced in-plane compressive stresses in the bulk of the coating. After applying a thermal treatment <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>adhesion</b> has been achieved. Laser induced delamination technique was used to monitor the adhesion properties. In this technique a coating is subjected to a series of infrared laser pulses with a stepwise increase of intensity. Upon increasing the laser pulse intensity, the pressure which is formed inside the blisters reaches a critical value, resulting in further delamination of the coating. To process the experimental data an elastic model was developed. From the analysis of the experimental data the critical stresses required for the delamination and the practical work <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> are derived. The model accounts for the compressive in-plane stress present in the coating of the deformed samples. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Recessive {{dystrophic}} {{epidermolysis bullosa}} (RDEB) {{is caused by}} defects in type-VII collagen (C 7), a protein encoded by the COL 7 A 1 gene and essential for anchoring fibril formation at the dermal-epidermal junction. Gene therapy of RDEB is based on transplantation of autologous epidermal grafts generated from genecorrected keratinocytes sustaining C 7 deposition at the dermal-epidermal junction. Transfer of the COL 7 A 1 gene is complicated by its very large size and repetitive sequence. This article reports a gene delivery approach based on the Sleeping beauty transposon, which allows integration of a full-length COL 7 A 1 cDNA and secretion of C 7 at physiological levels in RDEB keratinocytes without rearrangements or detrimental effects on their clonogenic potential.

In this study, we report that proliferation of breast cancer cells can resume following removal of a toxic stimulus causing severe impairment <b>of</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> and estrogen responsiveness. This type of response was induced by okadaic acid (OA) in MCF- 7 cells, and was accompanied by an almost complete block of DNA synthesis, loss of cell-cell contact and cell detachment from culture dishes, loss of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and E-cadherin, whereas only a weak, if any, inhibition of protein synthesis could be observed. These responses were detected in MCF- 7 cells after a 1 -day treatment with 50 nM OA, and could be reversed if OA-treated cells were recovered in a culture medium devoid of the toxin, so that rescued cells resumed growth 8 - 12 days after replating. By pulse-chase experiments, we found that protein synthesis was not significantly affected in rescued cells, whose DNA synthesis, instead, was almost completely blocked during the first days of MCF- 7 cell rescue from OA treatment. We also analyzed E-cadherin, mitogen activated protein kinase isoforms ERK 1 and ERK 2, Bcl- 2 and BAX proteins during the rescue of MCF- 7 cells from OA-induced cell death, and found that their expression followed temporally defined patterns. Cellular levels of E-cadherin returned to control levels within the first days of the rescue, followed by ER, ERK 1, and ERK 2, and finally by Bcl- 2 and BAX proteins. Under our experimental conditions, <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> did not require a functional ER system, but recovery of a normal ER pool accompanied resumption of estrogen-dependent proliferation of OA-treated MCF- 7 cells...|$|R
40|$|Islet {{transplantation}} {{has great}} potential in restoring normoglycemia in diabetic patients. However, current clinical islet transplantation {{is associated with}} high graft failure the reasons of which still remain obscure. It is noteworthy {{that the process of}} islet isolation exposes the islet to a variety of cellular stresses, including disruption of the cell-matrix relationship, an event associated with induction of apoptotic pathways. This may adversely affect islet viability and function leading to the observed failure of islet transplantation. The cell-matrix relationship, characterised by adhesion interactions between membrane integrin receptors and the extracellular matrix molecules at the nanoscale, is known to modulate cell survival and growth. The aim {{of this study is to}} present a unique method of fabricating large area artificial substrates with biomimetic nanoscale surface topography. The substrates were realised by thermal evaporation of tin on silicon wafers to form randomly assembled nano-islands. Using the nano-islands as masks, the wafers were plasma etched to transfer the pattern onto silicon. We then examined the hypothesis of whether beta-cell function and survival can be enhanced by optimized <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> cell-matrix <b>adhesion.</b> The results <b>of</b> in vitro cell cultures show that insulinoma cells significantly adhered and enhanced insulin secretion when cultured on these nano-structured substrates compared to planar controls.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of bioresorbable Seprafilm membrane in preventing abdominal adhesions in a prospective clinical randomized multicenter trial. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Adhesions occur frequently after abdominal operations and are a common cause of bowel obstruction, chronic abdominal pain, and infertility. To reduce the formation <b>of</b> <b>adhesions,</b> a mechanical barrier composed of hyaluronic acid and carboxymethylcellulose was developed, preventing adherence of tissues after abdominal surgery. METHODS: Between April 1996 and September 1998, all patients requiring a Hartmann procedure for sigmoid diverticulitis or obstructed rectosigmoid were randomized to either intraperitoneal placement of the antiadhesions membrane under the midline during laparotomy and in the pelvis, or as a control. Direct visual evaluation of the incidence and severity <b>of</b> <b>adhesions</b> was performed laparoscopically at second-stage surgery for <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> {{the continuity of the}} colon. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients were randomized; of these, 42 could be evaluated. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>adhesions</b> did not differ significantly between the two groups, but the severity <b>of</b> <b>adhesions</b> was significantly reduced in the Seprafilm group both for the midline incision and for the pelvic area. Complications occurred in similar numbers in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Seprafilm antiadhesions membrane appears effective in reducing the severity <b>of</b> postoperative <b>adhesions</b> after major abdominal surgery, although the incidence <b>of</b> <b>adhesions</b> was not diminished. The authors recommend using Seprafilm when relaparotomy or second-look intervention is planned. Long-term studies are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness and value of Seprafilm in preventing bowel obstruction, chronic abdominal pain, and infertility...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{study the}} success rate of hysteroscopic adhesiolysis and the {{spontaneous}} recurrence rate <b>of</b> intrauterine <b>adhesions</b> (IUAs) in patients with Asherman syndrome. Design Cohort study. Setting University-affiliated hospitals. Patient(s) A total of 638 women with Asherman syndrome were included, all diagnosed using hysteroscopy, and operated on between 2003 and 2013. Intervention(s) Hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. Main Outcome Measure(s) Hysteroscopic adhesiolysis was classified as successful if a normalization of menstrual blood flow occurred, along with a restored, healthy, cavity anatomy, free <b>of</b> <b>adhesions,</b> with hysteroscopic visualization of ≥ 1 tubal ostium. Recurrences <b>of</b> <b>adhesions</b> were diagnosed using hysteroscopy after an initial successful procedure. Result(s) A first-trimester procedure preceded Asherman syndrome in 371 women (58. 2 %) and caused <b>adhesions</b> <b>of</b> grades 1 - 2 A.

40|$|A change {{regarding}} the extent <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> - hereafter {{referred to as}} adhesion plasticity -between adhesive and less-adhesive states of mammalian cells is important for their behavior. To investigate adhesion plasticity, we have selected a stable isogenic subpopulation of human MDA-MB- 468 breast carcinoma cells growing in suspension. These suspension cells are unable to re-adhere to various matrices or to contract three-dimensional collagen lattices. By using transcriptome analysis, we identified the focal adhesion protein tensin 3 (Tns 3) as a determinant <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> plasticity. Tns 3 is strongly reduced at mRNA and protein levels in suspension cells. Furthermore, by transiently challenging breast cancer cells to grow under non-adherent conditions markedly reduces Tns 3 protein expression, which is regained upon re-adhesion. Stable knockdown of Tns 3 in parental MDA-MB- 468 cells results in defective adhesion, spreading and migration. Tns 3 -knockdown cells display impaired structure and dynamics <b>of</b> focal <b>adhesion</b> complexes as determined by immunostaining. <b>Restoration</b> <b>of</b> Tns 3 protein expression in suspension cells partially rescues adhesion and focal contact composition.
