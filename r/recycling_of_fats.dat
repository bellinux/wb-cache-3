This energy demand pushes the human to find different energy recourses such as solar energy or conversion of bio-waste to a biofuel. The {{researchers have been}} trying to develop an efficient way to produce biofuels as alternative fuel (Srirangsan et al. 2009). An alternate fuel needs several criteria such as sustainability, biodegradability, non-toxicity, low sulfur compounds and low carbon monoxide production and aromatic-free emission profile. The biodiesel or fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) provide the most of these criteria and it is environmentally beneficial in terms <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fat</b> and oil wastes (Karmee and Chadha 2005).|$|R
40|$|BSE is a fatal {{disease in}} cattle that {{involves}} spongiform {{changes to the}} brain. The disease is caused by infectious proteins, prions. The administration of feed containing proteins manufactured from infected cattle can infect more cattle. For that reason the administration of feed containing animal proteins to ruminants and other livestock has been banned within the European Union (EU) since 2001. In its statutory provisions Germany went even further. Besides the feed ban for animal proteins under EU law, the administration <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> from the tissue of warm-blooded land animals and of fish {{as well as of}} mixed feed containing individual feed of this kind, to horses and other food-producing livestock is likewise prohibited in national law. This ban does not apply to the administration <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> from fish tissue to non-ruminants. What prompted this special path of the Germans are the results of studies which show that animal fats may also be involved in the onset of BSE. Furthermore, with the current customary slaughter techniques {{it is not possible to}} obtain fats that are free of nerve tissue. Under certain circumstances, this nerve tissue may contain infectious prions that are not detected by the BSE rapid test. FLI and BfR urgently recommend the consistent prevention <b>of</b> the intra-species <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> certain processed <b>fats</b> in order to rule out as far as possible the risk of recirculation of the BSE pathogen in animal stocks. The same reservations still apply to the feeding <b>of</b> ruminant <b>fats</b> to ruminants that apply to ruminant proteins...|$|R

In this paper, microwave radiation has been used in the separation of these three components. The effects of time and temperature on the contents of these three components in kitchen waste were analyzed and the extraction process was discussed.

Used cooking oil can be refined into {{different types of}} biofuels used for power generation and heating. A significant benefit is that biofuels derived from recycled cooking oil typically burn clean, have a low carbon content and do not produce carbon monoxide. This helps communities to reduce their carbon footprints. The <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> cooking oil also provides a form of revenue for restaurants, which are sometimes compensated by cooking oil recyclers for their used deep fryer oil.
