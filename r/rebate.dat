5|$|Opponents of {{the plan}} criticize this tax <b>rebate</b> due to its costs. Economists at the Beacon Hill Institute {{estimated}} the overall <b>rebate</b> cost to be $489 billion (assuming 100% participation). In addition, economist Bruce Bartlett {{has argued that the}} <b>rebate</b> would create a large opportunity for fraud, treats children disparately, and would constitute a welfare payment regardless of need.|$|E
5|$|The {{effective}} {{tax rate}} for any household would be variable due to the fixed monthly tax <b>rebate</b> {{that are used to}} <b>rebate</b> taxes paid on purchases up to the poverty level. The tax would be levied on all U.S. retail sales for personal consumption on new goods and services. Critics argue that the sales tax rate defined in the legislation would not be revenue neutral (that is, it would collect less for the government than the current tax system), and thus would increase the budget deficit, unless government spending were equally reduced.|$|E

40|$|I {{discuss the}} impact of tying, bundling, and loyalty/requirement <b>rebates</b> on {{consumer}} surplus in the affected markets. I show that the Chicago School Theory of a single monopoly surplus that justifies tying, bundling, and loyalty/requirement <b>rebates</b> {{on the basis of}} efficiency typically fails. Thus, tying, bundling, and loyalty/requirement <b>rebates</b> can be used to extract consumer surplus and enhance profit of firms with market power. I discuss the various setups when this occurs. tying, ties, bundling, bundled <b>rebates,</b> loyalty discounts, loyalty requirement <b>rebates,</b> single monopoly surplus, monopolization, market power, foreclosure, antitrust...|$|R

40|$|Residential customers' {{choice of}} {{efficiency}} level for appliances, and {{their participation in}} demand-side management (DSM) programs, are examined using data on customers' stated preferences in hypothetical (i. e., conjoint-type) situations and their revealed preferences in real-world choices. The analysis provides information on customers' willingness to pay for energy savings, the importance of <b>rebates</b> in customers' decisions, and customers' response to DSM programs that offer loans for purchases of high-efficiency appliances. An estimated model is used to forecast the decisions of customers under: higher <b>rebates,</b> replacement of <b>rebates</b> with finance programs, offering of loans and <b>rebates</b> as alternative options for customers, {{and the elimination of}} DSM programs. We find that attractive loans (e. g., low interest rates, long repayment periods) are necessary to have the same effect as <b>rebates.</b> Programs that offer customers the option of loans or <b>rebates</b> are found to be far more effective than programs that offer only loans or only <b>rebates.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) to {{the jack}} jumper sting venom has shown {{effectiveness}} in preventing anaphylaxis, but the standardisation of jack jumper venom {{is yet to}} be validated.

Venom extract is only available through the Therapeutic Goods Administration Special Access Scheme.|$|E
5|$|General Motors is {{sponsoring}} the Pecan Street demonstration project in Austin, Texas. The project {{objective is to}} learn the charging patterns of plug-in electric car owners, and to study how a residential fleet of electric vehicles might strain the electric grid if all owners try to charge them at the same, {{which is what the}} preliminary monitoring found when the plug-in cars return home in the evening. The Mueller neighborhood is the test ground, and , the community has nearly 60 Chevrolet Volt owners alone. This cluster of Volts was achieved thanks to GM's commitment to match the federal government's $7,500 <b>rebate</b> incentive, which effectively halves the purchase price of the plug-hybrid electric cars.|$|E

40|$|Like most pricing practices, loyalty <b>rebates</b> {{may benefit}} or harm {{consumers}} {{according to the}} circumstances. In this essay, I review the pro- competitive and anticompetitive motives for loyalty <b>rebates.</b> Several conclusions emerge. First, every particular type of loyalty <b>rebates</b> can in some circumstances be pro-competitive. There is therefore little basis for a per se prohibition, even restricted to a particular category of suspicious-looking schemes. Second, dominant firms willing to engage into an exclusionary strategy may find that cleverly fine-tuned pricing schemes involving loyalty <b>rebates</b> possess several advantages over simple predatory pricing strategies: they can achieve exclusion at a lower cost, be more credible, and erect a permanent barrier to entry without any need for a recoupment period. Loyalty <b>rebates</b> thus deserve the scrutiny with {{which they have been}} gratified lately. I conclude by proposing a structured rule of reason for the antitrust handling of loyalty <b>rebates</b> cases. rebates; nonlinear pricing; exclusionary strategies; predatory pricing...|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} of wind power capacity in South Australia has been encouraged {{by a number}} of factors. These include the Australian Government's Renewable Energy Target, which require electricity retailers to source a proportion of energy from renewable sources, incentives from the South Australian Government including a supportive regulatory regime and a payroll tax <b>rebate</b> scheme for large scale renewable energy developments. Also the state's proximity to the Roaring forties means there are high quality wind resources for wind farms to exploit. In mid-2009, RenewablesSA was established by the South Australian Government to encourage further investment in renewable energy in the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{increase}} {{in the rate of}} the state sales tax from 6% to 7% took effect on July 15, 2006, and also increased the sales tax rate in the state's Urban Enterprise Zones (UEZs) from 3% to 3.5%. A significant change was made in the payment of sales taxes by businesses operating in the UEZs in that they would be required to pay the entire amount of the full tax rate to the state on all appropriate purchases, and wait for the state to <b>rebate</b> them the difference.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{government}} established several {{incentives for}} E85 flex-fuel vehicles. These include a fuel duty <b>rebate</b> on E85 fuel of 20 p per liter, until 2010; a £ 10 to 15 {{reduction in the}} vehicle excise duty (VED); and a 2% annual company car tax discount for flex-fuel cars. Despite {{the small number of}} E85 pump stations available, limited to the Morrisons supermarket chain stations, most automakers offer the same models in the UK that are available in the European market. In 2005 the Ford Focus Flexi-Fuel became the first flexible-fuel car sold in the UK, though E85 pumps were not opened until 2006. Volvo now offers its flexifuel models S80, S40, C30, V50 and V70. Other models available in the UK are the Ford C-Max Flexi-Fuel, and the Saab models 9-5 and 9-3 Flex-Fuel Biopower, and the new Saab Aero X BioPower E100 bioethanol.|$|E

50|$|The Elkins Act is a 1903 United States {{federal law}} that amended the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887. The Act {{authorized}} the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to impose heavy fines on railroads that offered <b>rebates,</b> and upon the shippers that accepted these <b>rebates.</b> The railroad companies were not permitted to offer <b>rebates.</b> Railroad corporations, their officers, and their employees, were all made liable for discriminatory practices.|$|R
40|$|Several {{incentive}} {{systems are}} examined that provide <b>rebates</b> on vehicles with higher-than-average fuel efficiency and levy fees on vehicles with less efficiency. The <b>rebates</b> and fees {{are applied to}} new vehicles {{at the time of}} purchase, and the rates are set such that the total outlay for <b>rebates</b> equals the revenues from fees. We find that moderately-sized <b>rebates</b> and fees result in a substantial increase in average fuel efficiency. Most of the effect is due to manufacturers' incorporating more fuel-efficiency technologies into the vehicles that they offer, since the <b>rebates</b> and fees effectively lower the price to manufacturers of these technologies. Consumer surplus is found to rise, and the profits of domestic manufacturers are estimated to drop only slightly under most systems and actually to rise under one system. ...|$|R
5|$|The hull {{had four}} levels {{separated}} by three decks. The terminology for {{these in the}} 16th century was still not standardised so the terms used here are those that were applied by the Mary Rose Trust. The hold lay furthest down in the ship, right above the bottom planking below the waterline. This is where the kitchen, or galley, was situated and the food was cooked. Directly aft of the galley was the mast step, a <b>rebate</b> in the centre-most timber of the keelson, right above the keel, which supported the main mast, and next to it the main bilge pump. To increase {{the stability of the}} ship, the hold was where the ballast was placed and much of the supplies were kept. Right above the hold was the orlop, the lowest deck. Like the hold it was partitioned and was also used as a storage area for everything from food to spare sails.|$|E
5|$|With a $45 million {{production}} budget, filming {{began on}} 12 November 2010 in Cape Town and took approximately 13 weeks, with second unit photography occurring over seven weeks. Filming locations included Johannesburg and Cape Town Film Studios (Dredd {{was the first}} project filmed at the studio). The project involved a majority of Cape Town crew members and about 40 imported crew. The producers chose to film in South Africa because of the lowered cost of employing cast and crew compared to locations in Europe and North America, and government incentives that offered to <b>rebate</b> up to 25% of the production costs. The film was shot digitally and primarily in 3D using RED MX, SI2K and Phantom Flex high-speed cameras. Multiple camera rigs were used. Some 2D elements were converted to 3D in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{warnings}} from Noseworthy to control spending, Dunderdale's first budget saw spending increase by 4.9 percent. Spending {{was focused on}} infrastructure, health care, social programs, Nalcor Energy {{as well as other}} areas. The budget included tax credits for child care, volunteer fire fighters as well as an 8 percent Residential Energy <b>Rebate</b> on home heating fuel, which is equal to the provincial portion of the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The budget raised the threshold on the payroll tax exemption from $1 million to $1.2 million. Despite a $598 million surplus for the previous year and a $59 surplus forecasted for the coming year, the province's net debt was expected to increase from $8.2 billion to $8.67 billion due to unfunded liabilities. However, on November 16, 2011, Dunderdale's government released their Fall economic update and announced that the surplus for the 2011-2012, fiscal year was now projected to be $755.8 million, with the added surplus going towards the debt. In the audited financial statements released in January 2013, the surplus for the 2011-2012 was $882.8 million, with the overall debt falling to $7.8 billion.|$|E

5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax <b>rebate</b> checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, during {{pre-production}} for The Dark Knight, Warner Bros. hired {{husband and}} wife screenwriting duo Michelle and Kieran Mulroney to script a Justice League film featuring a younger Batman in a separate franchise. George Miller was hired to direct the following September, with Armie Hammer cast as Batman a month later and Teresa Palmer as Talia al Ghul. Filming had nearly commenced at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, but was pushed back over the Writer's Guild of America strike, and once more when the Australian Film Commission denied Warner Bros. a 45 percent tax <b>rebate</b> over lack of Australian actors in the film. Production offices were moved to Vancouver Film Studios in Canada for an expected July 2008 start and a planned summer 2009 theatrical release date, but Warner Bros. ultimately canceled Justice League following the success of The Dark Knight. Hammer's option on his contract lapsed and the studio was more willing to proceed with Christopher Nolan to finish his trilogy separately with The Dark Knight Rises.|$|E
5|$|The {{budget of}} the series is {{estimated}} to be £15 million. Filming began in February 2013 and concluded in August 2013, with location shooting largely taken place in Kent and northern France. Filming in Kent was based in Discovery Park in Sandwich and was supported by the Kent Film Office. A former Pfizer facility was used as a number of sets, including the Calais police station and Elise's apartment. The series was filmed throughout five districts: Canterbury, Dover, Shepway, Swale and Thanet. Several prominent locales were featured, including Folkestone Harbour; The Turner Contemporary art gallery; Westwood Cross shopping centre; and the towns of Dover, Folkestone and Margate. Production also made use of the Kent Film Office's legal powers to close certain roads for uninterrupted filming. An estimated £2.5 million of the budget was spent on, among other services, accommodation, locations, parking and catering, providing a boost for the Kent economy. The filming in France was supported by the Nord-Pas de Calais Film Commission and benefited from the Tax <b>Rebate</b> International. Shooting took place over 31 days across Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais and Dunkerque.|$|E
