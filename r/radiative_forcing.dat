25|$|<b>Radiative</b> <b>forcing</b> is {{a measure}} of how various factors alter the energy balance of the Earth's atmosphere. A {{positive}} <b>radiative</b> <b>forcing</b> will tend to increase the energy of the Earth-atmosphere system, leading to a warming of the system. Between the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750, and the year 2005, the increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (chemical formula: CO2) led to a positive <b>radiative</b> <b>forcing,</b> averaged over the Earth's surface area, of about 1.66 watts per square metre (abbreviated Wm−2).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} natural and {{man-made}} mechanisms can affect the global energy balance and force changes in Earth's climate. Greenhouse gases are one such mechanism. Greenhouse gases absorb and emit some of the outgoing energy radiated from Earth's surface, causing that heat to be retained in the lower atmosphere. As explained above, some greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries, and therefore can affect Earth's energy balance over a long period. <b>Radiative</b> <b>forcing</b> quantifies the effect of factors that influence Earth's energy balance, including changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases. Positive <b>radiative</b> <b>forcing</b> leads to warming by increasing the net incoming energy, whereas negative <b>radiative</b> <b>forcing</b> leads to cooling.|$|E
25|$|The direct aerosol effect {{consists}} of any direct interaction of radiation with atmospheric aerosol, such as absorption or scattering. It affects both short and longwave radiation {{to produce a}} net negative <b>radiative</b> <b>forcing.</b> The magnitude of the resultant <b>radiative</b> <b>forcing</b> due to the direct effect of an aerosol {{is dependent on the}} albedo of the underlying surface, as this affects the net amount of radiation absorbed or scattered to space. e.g. if a highly scattering aerosol is above a surface of low albedo it has a greater <b>radiative</b> <b>forcing</b> than if it was above a surface of high albedo. The converse is true of absorbing aerosol, with the greatest <b>radiative</b> <b>forcing</b> arising from a highly absorbing aerosol over a surface of high albedo. The direct aerosol effect is a first order effect and is therefore classified as a <b>radiative</b> <b>forcing</b> by the IPCC. The interaction of an aerosol with radiation is quantified by the single-scattering albedo (SSA), the ratio of scattering alone to scattering plus absorption (extinction) of radiation by a particle. The SSA tends to unity if scattering dominates, with relatively little absorption, and decreases as absorption increases, becoming zero for infinite absorption. For example, sea-salt aerosol has an SSA of 1, as a sea-salt particle only scatters, whereas soot has an SSA of 0.23, showing that it is a major atmospheric aerosol absorber.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{results on}} {{momentum}} transfer during photoionization processes {{determine how the}} ionizing photon momentum is split between the ejected electron and the recoiling ion. This leads to improved <b>radiative</b> <b>force</b> calculations. The consequences of this recoil for <b>radiative</b> <b>forces</b> are demonstrated by comparing for lithium the new accurate results with calculations based on simpler approximations commonly used in the past. We show that at some densities and temperatures typical of deep stellar envelopes, the total <b>radiative</b> <b>force</b> on lithium becomes negative (outgoing stellar radiation pushing the ions inwards); however this negative force is then negligible compared to gravity. In stellar envelope calculations, the exact results for hydrogenoid states are well approximated by the simpler formula that Sommerfeld obtained for the hydrogen 1 s state. We also show that the force on Li depends significantly on the abundance of other elements, especially helium and oxygen, that block photon flux at critical wavelengths.

40|$|We provide {{hot star}} wind models with <b>radiative</b> <b>force</b> {{calculated}} using {{the solution of}} comoving frame (CMF) radiative transfer equation. The wind models are calculated for the first stars, O stars, and the central stars of planetary nebulae. We show that without line overlaps and with solely thermal line broadening the pure Sobolev approximation provides a reliable estimate of the <b>radiative</b> <b>force</b> even close to the wind sonic point. Consequently, models with the Sobolev line force provide good approximations to solutions obtained with non-Sobolev transfer. Taking line overlaps into account, the <b>radiative</b> <b>force</b> becomes slightly lower, leading to {{a decrease in the}} wind mass-loss rate by roughly 40 %. Below the sonic point, the CMF line force is significantly lower than the Sobolev one. In the case of pure thermal broadening, this does not influence the mass-loss rate, as the wind mass-loss rate is set in the supersonic part of the wind. However, when additional line broadening is present (e. g., the turbulent one) the region of low CMF line force may extend outwards to the regions where the mass-loss rate is set. This results in a decrease in the wind mass-loss rate. This effect can at least partly explain the low wind mass-loss rates derived from some observational analyses of luminous O stars.

40|$|In this work, we {{deal with}} the {{two-dimensional}} problem of steady plasma outflow from rotating central astrophysical gravitational objects. Considering the stellar atmosphere optically thin and the <b>radiative</b> <b>force</b> (due to the central object's luminosity) radial, we obtain fully analytical solutions for thermally and radiatively driven outflows. The flow is helicoidal and axisymmetric and the plasma inviscid and non-polytropic. First, we generalize the Kakouris & Moussas 1996 solution imposing a generalized geometry in the flow velocity which implies differential fluid rotation. The solutions are of four types with velocity maxima either along the equator or along the polar axis of the central body. The dependence of the solutions upon the radial distance R is similar to Kakouris & Moussas 1996 case for each type of solutions. Just assuming that the radiative acceleration {{is a function of the}} distance we obtain analytical 2 -D solutions for thermally and radiatively driven outflows. The inclusion of the <b>radiative</b> <b>force</b> helps the generation of the stellar wind giving higher maximum radial velocities. The velocity asymmetry between the equator and the poles varies with radial distance and it is sensitive upon the relative strength of the adopted <b>radiative</b> <b>force</b> as well as upon the degree of the fluid differential rotation. Several possible dependences of the radiative acceleration upon the radial distance are considered, and the deduction of the wind transition from a strong radiative driving to a pure non-radiative thermally driven outflow is presented by the given applications. The incorporation of the <b>radiative</b> <b>force</b> in the hydrodynamic equations is very important in massive winds of early and late type main sequence stars and evolved giants and supergiants. We present analytical 2 -D solutions for thermally plus radiatively driven stellar winds and we apply one kind of them to B 5 I type supergiants in order to understand the observed winds of these stars under a thermal (coronal) plus a radiative mechanism of ejecting stellar plasma in the interstellar medium.

We assume that at the inner boundary a “Wien fireball ” is realized, which is optically thick to Compton scattering but thin to absorption and in a Wien equilibrium state between pairs and photons at a relativistic temperature. As was shown by approximate treatments in our previous paper, the Wien fireball results in a relativistic outflow by thermal expansion, and thus problems with pair annihilation and radiation drag can be avoided. In this paper we present numerical solutions obtained with a Monte Carlo simulation of radiative transfer in a relativistic flow. Compton scattering, pair annihilation, and pair creation processes are considered in simulating the photon trajectories, and we evaluate the photon distribution function, pair creation rate, and <b>radiative</b> <b>force.</b> The dynamics of the outflow of pairs are consistently solved with <b>radiative</b> <b>force</b> and pair processes by iteration.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{optically}} thick line forces on orbiting circumstellar disks, such as occur around Be stars. For radially streaming radiation, line forces are only effective if there is a strong radial velocity gradient, as occurs, for example, in a line-driven stellar wind. However, within an orbiting disk, the radial shear of the azimuthal velocity leads to strong line-of-sight velocity velocity gradients along nonradial directions. As such, in the proximity of a stellar surface extending over a substantial cone angle, the nonradial stellar radiation can impart a significant line force, even in the case of purely circular orbits. Given the highly supersonic nature of orbital velocity variations, we use the Sobolev approximation, thereby extending to the disk case the standard CAK formalism developed for line-driven winds. We delineate the parameter regimes for which <b>radiative</b> <b>forces</b> might alter disk properties; but even when <b>radiative</b> <b>forces</b> are small, we analytically quantify higher-order effects in the linear limit, including the precession of weakly elliptical orbits. We find that optically thick line forces can have observable implications for the dynamics of disks around Be stars, including the generation of either prograde or retrograde precession in slightly eccentric orbits. However, our analysis suggests a net retrograde effect, in apparent contradiction with observed long-term variations of violet/red line profile asymmetries from Be stars, which are generally thought to result from prograde propagation of a so-called ``one arm mode''. We also conclude that <b>radiative</b> <b>forces</b> may alter the dynamical properties at the surface of the disk where disk winds originate, and may even make low-density disks vulnerable to being blown away.
