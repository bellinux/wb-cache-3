40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} component of driver assistance systems (DAS) is lane detection, and has been studied since the 1990 s. However, improving and generalizing lane detection solutions remains to be a challenging task until recently. A (physical) lane is defined by road boundaries or various kinds of lane marks, and this is only partially applicable for modeling the space an ego-vehicle is able to driving in. This paper proposes a concept of a (virtual) corridor for modeling this space. A corridor depends on information available about {{the motion of the}} ego-vehicle, as well as about the (physical) lane. This paper suggests robust corridor detection using hypothesis testing based on maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation. Then, boundary selection and <b>road</b> <b>patch</b> extension are applied as post-processing. Furthermore, a simple but efficient corridor tracking method is also discussed. This paper also informs the readers about experiments using images of some challenging road situations illustrating the usefulness of the proposed corridor detection and tracking scheme...|$|E

40|$|Patching {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{maintenance}} tasks carried out on low/medium volume roads in Malaysia. It is a technique of treating pavement distresses such as potholes and cracks. Failure of <b>patched</b> <b>road</b> is now becoming a burden to the responsible authority since a lot of money has been spent for repatching the same area of distresses. No appropriate guideline for patching works, mainly in terms of compaction effort and mixes is the reason for patching failure. Beside that, the selection of appropriate maintenance method also needs to be considered to ensure that the road can be repaired effectively. In this study, hot and cold mixes were used. The hot mixes used were ACW 20 and BMW 14, whilst cold mixes were IKRAMIX and SSMIX. The laboratory experiments conducted were Compaction, Bulk Specific Gravity, Stability and Flow, Permeability, Tensile Strength, Bitumen Extraction and Sieve Analysis. All tests were carried out according to standard requirement, JKR/SPJ/ 1988. from this study, it was found that hor mixes are most suitable to be used as <b>road</b> <b>patching</b> material.

40|$|Abstract—With {{the advent}} of the new IEEE 802. 11 p DSRC/WAVE radios, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) {{communications}} is poised for a dramatic leap. A canonical application for these future vehicular networks is the detection and notification of anomalous road events (e. g., potholes, bumps, icy <b>road</b> <b>patches,</b> etc.). We present the Road Information Sharing Architecture (RISA), the first distributed approach to road condition detection and dissemination for vehicular networks. RISA provides for the in-network aggregation and dissemination of event information detected by multiple vehicles in a timely manner for improved information reliability and bandwidth efficiency. RISA uses a novel Time-Decay Sequential Hypothesis Testing (TD-SHT) approach in which event information from multiple sources is combined with time-varying beliefs. We describe our implementation of RISA which has been deployed and tested on a fleet of vehicles on-site at the GM Warren Technical Center in Michigan. We further provide a comprehensive evaluation of the aggregation mechanism using emulation of the RISA code on real vehicular mobility traces. I...|$|R

"December 2012 "This thesis proposes a method for segmenting an unstructured dirt road in color space images using color and texture analysis. A support vector machine (SVM), or a Random Forest classifier is trained on samples of on and off <b>road</b> <b>patches</b> from a similar <b>road.</b> Image <b>patches</b> are classified at an interval of 10 pixels at a fixed horizontal distance from the vehicle. Each patch is described by the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), the Local Binary Patterns (LBP), a histogram of the three color channels, and a set of statistics are calculated on the color histograms. The classified patches are transformed to the next frame of the sequence using the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) to reduce classification of image patches that have been classified in previous frames. Morphological opening and closing are used to transform the points into a mask, and reduce errors. Further error reduction and smoothing of the boundary is made possible by following the corners of the positive road classification with a Kalman filter. Experimental results measured against a hand segmented ground truth indicated that the algorithm can accurately segment road images given a set of training data from similar road utilizing only color imagery...|$|R
40|$|A {{road network}} {{is one of}} the core {{elements}} of urban environments, strongly defining their layout. Procedural modeling has been increasingly used to create such road networks. However, many procedural methods are complex and difficult to master by non-experts, often have a limited and hard-to-control expressive range, and require a variety of specialized input data to generate a complex road network. To mitigate this, some methods proposed to use stochastic data on <b>road</b> <b>patches</b> extracted from example maps to design a road network following a given urban style. We propose a novel patch-based method that uses the semantics of individual patches to help guiding the procedural generation. Our approach combines the advantages of patch-based generation with those of conventional parametric-based methods. Due to the intuitive character of semantic parameters and tags, our approach provides for an easy customization of fictive road network creation, allowing a user to easily define various types of road network styles, containing only the desired features and structures of real-world road networks.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} UGV navigation in various environments and lightning conditions. Previous approaches {{use a combination of}} different sensors, or work well, only in scenarios with noticeable road marking or borders. Our robot is used for chemical, nuclear and biological contamination measurement. Thus, to avoid complications with decontamination, only a monocular camera serves as a sensor since it is already equipped. In this paper, we propose a novel approach- a fusion of frequency based vanishing point estimation and probabilistically based color segmentation. Detection of a vanishing point, is based on the estimation of a texture flow, produced by a bank of Gabor wavelets and a voting function. Next, the vanishing point defines the training area, which is used for self-supervised learning of color models. Finally, <b>road</b> <b>patches</b> are selected by measuring of the roadness score. A few rules deal with dark cast shadows, overexposed highlights and adaptivity speed. In addition to the robustness of our system, it is easy-to-use since no calibration is needed. I...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} dynamic scene {{understanding}} for mobile robot navigation. In the first part, we propose {{a novel approach}} to self-supervised learning – a fusion of frequency based vanishing point estimation and probabilistically based color segmentation. Detection of a vanishing point {{is based on the}} estimation of a texture flow produced by a bank of Gabor wavelets and a voting function. Next, the vanishing point defines the training area which is used for self-supervised learning of color models. Finally, <b>road</b> <b>patches</b> are selected by measuring roadness score. A few rules deal with dark cast shadows, overexposed hightlights and adaptivity speed. In addition to that, the whole vanishing point estimation is refined – Gabor filters are approximated by Haar-like box functions, which enables efficient filtering via integral image trick. The tightest bottleneck, a voting scheme, is modified to coarse-to-fine, which provides a significant speed-up (more than 40 ×), while we loose only 3 − 5 % in precision. The second part proposes a smoothing filter for spatio-temporal consistency of structured predictions, that are useful for more mature systems. The key part of the propose...|$|R

40|$|This project {{proposes a}} new design for an {{obstacle}} avoider whose main decision-making component is a decoder. The decoder {{acts as a}} substitute for the microcontroller. The obstacle detecting sensors provide the input for the decoder and the decoder conveys the inputs to the motor enabling the movement. The power of AND gates and OR gates is long forgotten. Every one of us remembers their truth table just like a fact. The truth that they can be used for application has become a practical joke. Microcontrollers have come into play regardless of the complexity of the application. An obstacle avoider is a simple robot that has one dimensional motion; it can find its way through obstacles. In such case an obstacle can be anything. It changes with every application. For e. g., (1) for a car the obstacle would be the <b>road</b> <b>patches</b> and (2) for a physically abled person in a wheel chair the obstacle would be people. Robots can be made without microcontrollers. Microcontroller can be reprogrammed to serve a different purpose. Generally, one cannot expect a common user to reprogram it. If it is coded as an avoider it is an avoider throughout. This led to the spark of the idea. The usage of a decoder instead of a microcontroller greatly reduces the cost; additionally the decoder being memory less the access time is negligible...|$|R
40|$|The {{vast amount}} of civil {{infrastructure}} in the United States includes an extensive stretch of road networks. From an economic point of view it is more cost effective to maintain the already existing pavements rather than building new ones. A {{large proportion of the}} traffic delays on these road networks are caused by road closures and closures of individual lanes for pavement maintenance purposes. The application of early strength concrete in pavement maintenance measures will lead to a substantial reduction in the user costs involved with the road closures caused by such maintenance. These costs involve both the actual costs of the delays in terms of time and fuel consumption, but also, more importantly, the social and economic costs associated with the safety hazards resulting from these closures.
