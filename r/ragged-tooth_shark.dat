500|$|The {{first known}} {{bigeye sand tiger}} was a female [...] long caught off Madeira in April 1941, on a {{longline}} set for black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo). The specimen was mounted and later {{formed the basis for}} a scientific description authored by German ichthyologist Günther Maul in a 1955 article for Notulae Naturae.

Maul assigned his new species to the genus Carcharias, which at the time was used for all members of the sand tiger shark family. When the Odontaspis came to be recognized as a valid genus separate from Carcharias, the bigeye sand tiger was reassigned as well given its resemblance to the smalltooth sand tiger (O. ferox). Until more specimens were examined in the 1980s, some authors speculated that this species represented an extreme variant of the smalltooth sand tiger. Other names for this shark include black sand tiger, oceanic sand tiger, and bigeye <b>ragged-tooth</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|E

The grey nurse shark, the name used in Australia and the United Kingdom, is the second-most-used name for the shark, and in India it is known as blue-nurse sand tiger.

5000|$|The English {{common name}} [...] "crocodile shark" [...] {{is derived from}} its Japanese name mizuwani (水鰐, {{literally}} [...] "water crocodile"), which refers to its sharp teeth and habit of snapping vigorously when {{taken out of the}} water. Other common names for this species include Japanese <b>ragged-tooth</b> <b>shark,</b> Kamohara's sand-shark, and water crocodile. The crocodile shark was first described as Carcharias kamoharai in a 1936 issue of Zoological Magazine (Tokyo) by ichthyologist Kiyomatsu Matsubara, based on a 73.5 cm long specimen found at the Koti Fish Market in Japan. The type specimen is a 1 m long adult male found at a fish market in Su-ao, Taiwan.|$|E

50|$|The Grey Nurse shark (Carcharias taurus), {{also called}} the Sand Tiger shark or <b>Ragged-tooth</b> <b>shark,</b> is an elasmobranch and belongs to the carpet shark family. It can easily be {{recognized}} by its characteristic conical snout and under hung jaw. Both jaws are laden with sharp, long and pointed teeth. The head is flattened {{and it has a}} large and stout body which ranges up to 3.2m and may weigh up to 300 kg. The body is grey to grey-brown dorsally and off-white on the belly. The juveniles (young sharks) usually have dark spots on the upper two thirds of the body. The first and second dorsal fins are of similar size and the caudal fin is asymmetric. Once believed to be a man-eater it is now known that this shark rarely attacks humans and if it does it is only in defence; or if it is baited. Sharks are the top predators in our oceans, and as such they are important for the marine ecosystems as important regulators of other species. They eat the weak, the old and the dead animals. The Grey Nurse sharks eat mainly lobsters, crabs, smaller sharks, fish, rays and squid.|$|E
5000|$|The sand {{tiger shark}} (Carcharias taurus), grey nurse shark, spotted <b>ragged-tooth</b> <b>shark,</b> or blue-nurse sand tiger is a species of shark that inhabits {{subtropical}} and temperate waters worldwide. It inhabits the continental shelf, from sandy shorelines (hence the name {{sand tiger shark}}) and submerged reefs {{to a depth of}} around 191 m. They dwell in the waters of Japan, Australia, South Africa, the Mediterranean and the east coasts of North and South America. Despite its name, it is not related to the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier; however, it is a cousin of the great white shark Carcharodon carcharias. Despite its fearsome appearance and strong swimming ability, it is a relatively placid and slow-moving shark with no confirmed human fatalities. This species has a sharp, pointy head, and a bulky body. The sand tiger's length can reach 3.2 m. They are grey with reddish-brown spots on their backs. Shivers (groups) have been observed to hunt large schools of fish. Their diet consists of bony fish, crustaceans, squid, skates and other sharks. Unlike other sharks, the sand tiger can gulp air from the surface, allowing it to be suspended in the water column with minimal effort. During pregnancy, the most developed embryo will feed on its siblings, a reproductive strategy known as intrauterine cannibalism i.e. [...] "embryophagy" [...] or, more colorfully, adelphophagy — literally [...] "eating one's brother". The sand tiger is categorized as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. It is the most widely kept large shark in public aquariums owing to its tolerance for captivity.|$|E

40|$|The {{phylogeny}} of {{the genus}} Udonella has been disputed for quite some time, but recent phylogenetic analysis of molecular data confirms that the genus is a monopisthocotylean monogenean. Specimens of Udonella myliobati parasitizing the copepod Lepeophtheirus natalensis, an ectoparasite of the spotted <b>ragged-tooth</b> <b>shark,</b> (Carcharias taurus), were collected and studied. A total of 771 monogenean specimens were recovered from 54 infected copepods examined, with a mean intensity of 14, 3 worms per copepod. Most of the monogeneans were found attached to the dorsal surface of the lateral and frontal marginal membranes of the copepod carapace. Eggs, with filaments and adhesive discs, were found ventrally on the host, mainly attached to the maxillae and maxillipeds, in clusters of 12 - 14. Observations on the morphology, distribution and behaviour of this monogenean are presented {{with the aid of}} light and scanning electron microscopy.
