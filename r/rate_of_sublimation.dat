An alternative technique {{with a lower}} energy demand is the extraction of oils using supercritical liquid carbon dioxide (CO 2), which extracts essential oils with minimal environmental impact. While this often requires large-scale equipment, recent academic studies have established a simple procedure that uses liquid CO 2 from dry ice to extract orange oil.

The models calculate the mass transport of snow as saltating and suspended flow and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sublimation</b> of snow in transport. The saltation expression is calibrated using field measurements of horizontal mass flux near the snow surface, which show an approximately linear increase with wind-speed. The suspension expression is calibrated from field measurements of the horizontal mass flux at heights from near the surface to two metres, which show an exponential increase with the wind-speed. Sublimation of blowing snow {{is calculated based on}} a consideration of heat and water vapour fluxes at the particle surface. Sublimation rates increase exponentially with wind-speed and increase by an order of magnitude as the air temperature increases from - 35 °C to - 1 °C or the relative humidity decreases from 95 % to 40 %. The expressions are compiled in a mass-balance model, termed the Prairie Blowing Snow Model, which calculates the horizontal mass flux and sublimation rate of blowing snow and the erosion rate at the surface. The Model uses standard meteorological station measurements and terrain data as inputs. The distance over which snow may blow without obstruction is shown to be an important parameter affecting the surface erosion rate. For distances less than 400 to 500 m the erosion rate is controlled by the magnitude of the horizontal mass flux, while for greater distances the sublimation rate controls erosion...|$|E

Because of difficulties related to calibration and postprocessing, the RICE probe was mainly used as an indicator of the presence of supercooled liquid water. The accuracy of the RICE probe for measurements of supercooled liquid water content is studied here. The theory of ice accretion on an unheated cylinder is applied to the RICE probe. A steady-state heat balance on the surface of a riming cylinder is considered in detail. It is shown that the threshold sensitivity of the RICE probe is limited by the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sublimation</b> of ice and it may exceed 0. 01 g m 23 at airspeed 200 m s 21.

When sea ice is cooled, hydrohalite begins to precipitate within brine inclusions at about - 23 C. In this work, hydrohalite crystals are examined in laboratory experiments: their formation, their shape, and their response to warming and desiccation. <b>Sublimation</b> <b>of</b> a sea ice surface at low temperature leaves a lag deposit of hydrohalite, which has {{the character of a}} fine powder.

40|$|Thermodynamic {{properties}} of uranium-bismuth alloys {{were determined by}} measuring the vapor pressure of bismuth in equilibrium with the condensed phase. Classical methods based on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sublimation,</b> rate of evaporation or rate of effusion {{could not be used}} since each method requires an accurate knowledge of the molecular weight of the vapor. The molecular weight of bismuth is not accurately known, but the presence of Bi and Bi 2 species has been established. An optical absorption technique was used to determine the concentration of each species independently. Briefly, this method consists of measuring concentrations in a vapor by the quantity of light absorbed at certain characteristic frequencies by the species in the vapor. The amount of each species present, which is related to the pressure, was determined by measuring the diminution of intensity at 3067 and 2731 A. The amount of radiation absorbed was found to be dependent on the thickness of the vapor space and the concentration of the bismuth vapor. The thermodynamic activity of bismuth was measured at temperatures from 725 to 875 [deg]C in the regions: U 3 Bi 4 + UBi 2, UBi 2 + liquid and the one-phase, liquid region. In order to obtain measurable quantities in the regions UBi + U and UBi + U 3 Bi 4 it was necessary to work at temperatures from 800 to 1000 [deg]C. From a measure of the activity of bismuth, the activity of uranium was calculated for the entire system. The liquid uranium [...] bismuth alloys were found not to be regular solutions.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of ice accretion within commercial high bypass aircraft turbine engines {{has been reported}} under certain atmospheric conditions. Engine anomalies have taken place at high altitudes that were attributed to ice crystal ingestion, partially melting, and ice accretion on the compression system components. The result was {{one or more of}} the following anomalies: degraded engine performance, engine roll back, compressor surge and stall, and flameout of the combustor. The main focus of this research is the development of a computational tool that can estimate whether there is a risk of ice accretion by tracking key parameters through the compression system blade rows at all engine operating points within the flight trajectory. The tool has an engine system thermodynamic cycle code, coupled with a compressor flow analysis code, and an ice particle melt code that has the capability of determining the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sublimation,</b> melting, and evaporation through the compressor blade rows. Assumptions are made to predict the complex physics involved in engine icing. Specifically, the code does not directly estimate ice accretion and does not have models for particle breakup or erosion. Two key parameters have been suggested as conditions that must be met at the same location for ice accretion to occur: the local wet-bulb temperature to be near freezing or below and the local melt ratio must be above 10 %. These parameters were deduced from analyzing laboratory icing test data and are the criteria used to predict the possibility of ice accretion within an engine including the specific blade row where it could occur. Once the possibility of accretion is determined from these parameters, the degree of blockage due to ice accretion on the local stator vane can be estimated from an empirical model of ice growth rate and time spent at that operating point in the flight trajectory. The computational tool can be used to assess specific turbine engines to their susceptibility to ice accretion in an ice crystal environment...|$|E
40|$|The polar terrains of Mars {{are covered}} in many places with {{irregular}} pits and retreating scarps, as {{are some of the}} surfaces of the outer-planet satellites. These features are interpreted by us as diagnostic of exogenic degradation due to the loss of a volatile rock-forming matrix or cement. In this study we propose that sublimation degradation is a plausible Solar Systemwide geological process. Candidate examples have been identified on Mars, Io, and Triton, and possibly Europa and Ganymede. We envision this process as having two end-member expressions (pits and scarps), for which we hypothesize two end-member mechanisms (massive localized lenses and areally extensive basal layers). In this study we focus on the role this process may play on the surfaces of the galilean satellites. Our principle modeling results are that for these satellites, H 2 S, CO 2, and NH 3 are the only viable candidate volatiles for sublimation degradation of landforms, in light of galilean satellite cosmochemistry. For Io's polar regions only H 2 S, and then only from slopes that face the Sun and have thin lags, is volatile enough to cause the observed sublimation-induced erosion at those latitudes. SO 2 is not a viable candidate as an agent of erosion, especially for these polar landforms. In the case of Europa, only CO 2 and H 2 S are viable candidates (given surface age constraints). Both species could be efficient eroders in nonpolar regions. H 2 S could generate erosion within the polar regions if the deposition and erosion conditions were essentially identical as those we invoked for Io's polar regions. For Ganymede (and Callisto) NH 3 might be an agent of erosion in equatorial terrains of great age. The sublimation of CO 2 and H 2 S is much more robust than NH 3.

40|$|A thin glacial diamicton, informally termed Granite drift, {{occupies}} {{the floor of}} central Beacon Valley in southern Victoria Land, Antarctica. This drift is 25 % striated clasts in the > 16 mm fraction and a weathered, clast-supported diamicton with varnished and wind-faceted gravels and cobbles. The weathered facies is a coarse-grained lag of Granite drift that occurs {{at the base of}} polygon troughs and in lenses within the nonweathered facies. The concentration of cosmogenic 3 He in dolerite cobbles from two profiles through the nonweathered drift facies exhibits steadily decreasing values and shows the drift to have formed by <b>sublimation</b> <b>of</b> underlying ice. These profile patterns and the 3 He surface-exposure ages of 1. 18 ± 0. 08 Ma and 0. 18 ± 0. 01 Ma atop these profiles indicate that churning of clasts by cryoturbation has not occurred at these sites in at least the past 105 and 106 yr. Although Granite drift is stable at polygon centers, low-frequency slump events occur at the margin of active polygons. Slumping, together with weathering of surface clasts, creates the large range of cosmogenic-nuclide surface-exposure ages observed for Granite drift. Maximum <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>sublimation</b> near active thermal-contraction cracks, calculated by using the two 3 He depth profiles, range from 5 m/m. y. to 90 m/m. y. Sublimation rates are likely highest immediately following major slump events and decrease thereafter to values well below our maximum estimates. Nevertheless, these <b>rates</b> are orders <b>of</b> magnitude lower than those computed on theoretical grounds. During eruptions of the nearby McMurdo Group volcanic centers, ash-fall debris collects at the surface of Granite drift, either in open thermal-contraction cracks or in deep troughs that lie above contraction cracks; these deposits subsequently lower passively as the underlying glacier ice sublimes. The fact that some regions of Granite drift have escaped modification by patterned ground for at least 8. 1 Ma indicates long-term geomorphic stability of individual polygons. Once established, polygon toughs likely persist for as long as 105 – 106 yr. Our model of patterned-ground formation, which applies to the hyperarid, cold-desert, polar climate of Antarctica, may also apply to similar-sized polygons on Mars that occur over buried ice in Utopia Planitia. 10 figures; 3 tables. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

To facilitate nanotube growth, experiments were conducted with a bimetallic catalyst of nickel and holmium in two ratios of 1 : 3 : 96 and 2 : 2 : 96 at% (Ho:Ni:C at%) with the 96 being graphite powder. Tests were conducted at 3 electrical current settings: 75, 90 and 105 amps. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the production of carbon nanotubes in all tests, substantiated by x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Preliminary experiments indicated that a catalyst ratio of 2 : 2 : 96 at 75 amps produced the highest <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> carbon <b>sublimation</b> and XRD analysis suggests the highest quantity of single-walled carbon nanotubes produced...|$|R
40|$|Despite being {{ubiquitous}} in the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB) of Canada, {{the role of}} snow in its energy and water budgets are still open to much speculation. This thesis presents a multi-scale analysis of the contribution of blowing snow to the hydrometeorology of the MRB. A climatology of adverse wintertime weather events is first presented and demonstrates that blowing snow events are rare within the forested sections of the MRB but become more frequent in the northern parts of the basin covered by Arctic tundra. It is these areas which experience the largest impacts of blowing snow transport and sublimation due to large-scale processes. To further assess the mesoscale and microscale effects of blowing snow to the northern regions of the MRB, {{the development of a}} bulk blowing snow model is then described. The single- and double-moment versions of the PIEKTUK blowing snow model are shown to produce equivalent results as a previous spectral version of the numerical model while operating about 100 times faster. The application of the double-moment PIEKTUK model (PIEKTUK-D) to a Canadian Arctic tundra site near the northern tip of the MRB reveals that blowing snow sublimation depletes ≈ 3 mm snow water equivalent (swe) from the snowpack over a period of 210 days during the winter of 1996 / 1997 at Trail Valley Creek, Northwest Territories. Various assumptions {{on the state of the}} background thermodynamic profiles and their evolution during blowing snow, however, can yield significantly higher (> 300 %) <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>sublimation</b> over the same period. PIEKTUK-D is then coupled to the Mesoscale Compressible Community (MC 2) model for an interactive simulation of a ground blizzard at Trail Valley Creek. This coupled mesoscale simulation reveals that moistening and cooling of near-surface air associated with blowing snow sublimation is observed but mitigated in part by advective and entrainment processes. Combined, blowing snow sublimation and mass divergence are then shown to re...|$|R
40|$|Four {{different}} trivalent and tetravalent metal phthalocyanine systems (chlorogallium, chloroindium, vanadyl, and titanyl phthalocyanines) {{were used}} singly to prepare thin films (0. 05 - 2. 0 micron thickness) on gold, optically transparent substrates. The photoelectronic properties of these electrodes could be modified either by altering the growth conditions (i. e. <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sublimation,</b> cleanliness of substrate) or by dosing the thin films with either hydrogen or oxygen at elevated temperatures (150 °C). The properties of these thin films were monitored by electron microscopy, UV-visible spectrophotometry, X-ray and Ultra-violet surface spectroscopies, {{and a variety}} of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical techniques. All four systems behaved {{in a manner similar to}} a p-type semiconductor when prepared at rapid rates (10 - 20 A/min) on gold substrates. In the dark, for contacting redox couples with Eᵒ’ values negative of + 0. 6 V, the phthalocyanine electrodes showed negligible dark currents. Upon illumination, the photoelectrodes only produced positive photopotentials. Chlorogallium phthalocyanine thin films could be made to produce both positive and negative photopotentials when grown at slow rates (1 - 5 A/min) on clean, gold substrates. These chlorogallium phthalocyanine electrodes regained the properties of a p-type semiconductor after being dosed with oxygen for 48 hours at 150 °C. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy confirmed the presence of a high concentration of oxygen at the surface of all of the p-type phthalocyanine electrodes. The oxygen may accept electron density from the phthalocyanine macrocycle to cause the Fermi level to move down in energy toward its valence band edge. Dosing the film with hydrogen caused the electrode to exhibit its original intrinsic characteristics. This variability in electrical properties as a function of gas dopant may lead to the development of a sensitive gas sensing device. Ultra-violet Photoelectron Spectroscopy, as well as molecular orbital calculations, were applied to the chlorogallium phthalocyanine system to determine the molecular orbital contributions to its valence and conduction bands. Photoelectrochemical cells made from electrodes of chlorogallium and vanadyl phthalocyanines exhibited power conversion efficiencies in excess of 0. 1 %. The vanadyl and titanyl phthalocyanine electrodes were also effective catalysts for the photoreduction of H⁺ to H₂...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{performed}} to simulate the shallow ascent and surface release of water and brines under low atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric pressure was treated as an independent variable and water temperature and vapor pressure were examined {{as a function of}} total pressure variation down to low pressures. The physical and thermal responses of water to reducing pressure were monitored with pressure transducers, temperature sensors and visible imaging. Data were obtained for pure water and for solutions with dissolved NaCl or CO 2. The experiments showed the pressure conditions under which the water remained liquid, underwent a rapid phase change to the gas state by boiling, and then solidified because of removal of latent heat. Liquid water is removed from phase equilibrium by decompression. Solid, liquid and gaseous water are present simultaneously, and not at the 611 Pa triple point, because dynamic interactions between the phases maintain unstable temperature gradients. After phase changes stop, the system reverts to equilibrium with its surroundings. Surface and shallow subsurface pressure conditions were simulated for Mars and the icy satellites of the outer Solar System. Freezing by evaporation in the absence of wind on Mars is shown to be unlikely for pure water at pressures greater than c. 670 Pa, and for saline solutions at pressures greater than c. 610 Pa. The physical nature of ice that forms depends on the salt content. Ice formed from saline water at pressures less than c. 610 Pa could be similar to terrestrial sea ice. Ice formed from pure water at pressures less than c. 100 Pa develops a low thermal conductivity and a ‘honeycomb’ structure created by sublimation. This ice could have a density as low as c. 450 kg m- 3 and a thermal conductivity as low as 1. 6 Wm- 1 K- 1, and is highly reflective, more akin to snow than the clear ice from which it grew. The physical properties of ice formed from either pure or saline water at low pressures will act to reduce the surface temperature, and hence <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sublimation,</b> thereby prolonging the lifespan of any liquid water beneath...|$|E
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2007, {{the number of people}} living in the world’s urban areas {{exceeded}} that of those living in the countryside. Such urbanisation tends to modify the climates of towns and cities {{as a result of a}} number of factors which together form the ‘urban heat island’ effect. In order to better design buildings and urban areas to cope with these effects, it is first necessary to understand the heat transfer mechanisms which are taking place. The aim of the current research has therefore been to provide convective heat transfer data appropriate for low-rise urban environments by investigating the effects of wind speed, direction and street geometry. The research has employed the naphthalene sublimation technique which has been extended in several fundamental areas including development of a novel approach to measure the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sublimation</b> from wind tunnel models. This technique has permitted measurements to be made over an array of discrete locations, revealing the variation across building surfaces. The uncertainty in the convective heat transfer coefficients obtained was calculated to be approximately ± 6 %. Tests were conducted in the BRE wind tunnel with an atmospheric boundary layer simulation appropriate to inner city areas. Cube models were arranged so as to form long rows of flat-roofed buildings referred to as ‘street canyons’. A series of correlations have been derived from the experimental results from which the rate of convection occurring from each building surface may be obtained with respect to wind speed. The greatest rates of convective heat transfer have been shown to occur at the top of the windward wall and leading edge of the roof, the lowest rates from the leeward wall of a building. Convection was found to be reduced in narrow street canyons. In wider street canyons, the convective coefficients on the exposed windward and roof surfaces of buildings were higher, but the values on the leeward wall are lessened due to the distancing of the downstream windward vortex. The effect of wind direction was found to be relatively small and therefore it is proposed that the convective heat transfer relationships presented may be applied irrespective of wind direction.

40|$|One {{aspect of}} the {{seasonal}} pressure variations measured at the Viking Lander sites is their nearly perfect interannual repeatability. This presents a problem because it implies that {{the behavior of the}} seasonal polar caps should be highly repeatable from year to year as well. There are a number of observations and theories suggesting that the presence of dust and water ice clouds in the Martian atmosphere should have significant direct and indirect effects on the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 condensation and sublimation in the north and south polar regions. These effects include (1) reduced <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 frost condensation during polar night seasons due to the radiative effects of dust and water ice clouds and associated CO 2 clouds or elevated atmospheric temperatures and (2) reduced or elevated <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> frost <b>sublimation</b> due to the radiative effects of atmospheric dust or to changes in frost emissivities and albedos due to contamination by water ice and dust. The Viking Landing pressure observations are examined to determine the range and character of the interannual variations present.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Subsurface ice {{is common}} in regions where mean annual {{temperatures}} are below the freezing point of water. Once present, this ice may persist {{for long periods of}} time even under unfavorable environmental conditions. Subsurface ice is fundamentally important as a source of water for plants and microbes, a proxy for paleoclimatic information, and a major component controlling the periglacial landscape. This dissertation examines the stability and persistence of ground ice both in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica, a small part of the continent that is not covered in ice, and at the equatorial region on Mars. This research was initially motivated by claims that the ice buried under several decimeters of dry regolith in Beacon Valley is more than 1 Ma old and perhaps over 8. 1 Ma, thereby making it the oldest known ice on Earth. My study uses numerical modeling to determine the short-term and long-term <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>sublimation</b> <b>of</b> ground ice; the latter bears directly on the longevity of subsurface ice. The modeling utilizes extensive soil and environmental data from a well characterized site in Beacon Valley. One component of the model is to reconstruct subsurface temperatures based on measured surface temperatures. It is validated using ground temperature measurements. Both thermal and <b>sublimation</b> components <b>of</b> the model are then coupled, along with environmental data from the Curiosity Rover, to numerically simulate the <b>sublimation</b> <b>of</b> ground ice in Gale Crater, and to consider the potential for ground ice to have persisted there {{for long periods of time}}. The contemporary <b>sublimation</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> ground ice in Beacon Valley, Antarctica is modeled using a vapor diffusion model constrained by 12 years of climate and soil temperature data, and field data of episodic snow cover and snowmelt events that have not been represented in previous models of the ground ice sublimation. The model is extended to reconstruct the sublimation history over the last 200 ka using paleotemperatures estimated from ice core data from nearby Taylor Dome, and a relationship between atmospheric temperature and humidity derived from our meteorological records. This study provides a realistic estimate <b>of</b> the long-term <b>sublimation</b> history in Beacon Valley. Sublimation occurs throughout the modeled period; however, the rates are slow enough that the residual buried ice is likely older than 1 Ma. I also studied the subsurface thermal regime and soil thermal properties in Beacon Valley and, using temperature dependent thermal properties, numerically solved the heat diffusion equation using the finite volume method. The modeled temperatures approximate closely the measured temperatures at all depths with average differences ranging from 0. 01 °C to 0. 03 °C. The latent heat from documented episodic snowmelt events or modeled changes in ice content due to condensation or sublimation have negligible effects on the temperature. This study validates that our model is applicable to ground conditions in the cold, dry environments in general, including other regions in Antarctica, high mountain ranges in the central Asian and South America, and on Mars. The heat and vapor diffusion models developed for Beacon Valley were then applied to Gale Crater, Mars to study the ground temperature and stability of ice that formed potentially during the last high obliquity phase of Mars. This study of subsurface heat and vapor transport is made use of one year of extensive ground based measurements by Curiosity′s Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS). As in Beacon Valley, ground ice is currently unstable along the Curiosity traverse; furthermore, also analogous to Beacon Valley, Gale Crater may have relict ground ice from as recently as ~ 0. 5 Ma during the last high obliquity period. Similarly, modeling the sublimation rates, adjusted for Mars conditions, shows that water vapor loss deceases increasingly with depth as overlying dry regolith thickens. My study suggests ground ice that may have formed ~ 0. 5 Ma ago could persist within meters of the surface; this finding may be important for future mission considerations. Overall, my studies advance our understanding of the thermal regime and long-term stability of subsurface ice in frigid, hyperarid environments...|$|R
