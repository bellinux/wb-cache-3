25|$|Cleanrooms {{maintain}} particulate-free {{air through}} the use of either HEPA or ULPA filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be recirculated. Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The <b>rough</b> <b>air</b> seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment. US FDA and EU have laid down guidelines and limit for microbial contamination which is very stringent to ensure freedom from microbial contamination in pharmaceutical products.|$|E

5000|$|The U.S. Army Air Corps and the U.S. Navy {{experimented with}} autopilots on {{military}} aircraft {{before and during}} World War II. Straight and level flight had become a necessity for new level bombing techniques that were being developed at the time. The Sperry Gyroscope Company developed many autopilot systems for use on military aircraft. When the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress was delivered in the late 1930s, it came equipped a commercial Sperry A-3 Autopilot. The A-3 was a simple autopilot and only corrected angular deviations in the aircraft’s straight and level course. It utilized pneumatic hydraulic servos, which {{had a tendency to}} react slowly to inputs, and this often led to overcompensation of the aircraft’s corrected course. This caused navigation and control issues when pilots were flying in poor weather or <b>rough</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
50|$|An aft CG {{condition}} can {{be recognized}} by the pilot when coming to a hover following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter will have a tail-low attitude, and the pilot will need excessive forward displacement of cyclic control to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition. If there is a wind, the pilot needs even greater forward cyclic. If flight is continued in this condition, the pilot may find it impossible to fly in the upper allowable airspeed range due to inadequate forward cyclic authority to maintain a nose-low attitude. In addition, with an extreme aft CG, gusty or <b>rough</b> <b>air</b> could accelerate the helicopter to a speed faster than that produced with full forward cyclic control. In this case, dissymmetry of lift and blade flapping could cause the rotor disc to tilt aft. With full forward cyclic control already applied, the rotor disc {{might not be able}} to be lowered, resulting in possible loss of control, or the rotor blades striking the tail boom.|$|E

60|$|This triple {{division}} {{corresponds with}} the broad distinctions of climate. In the northern plains {{the atmosphere is}} damp and heavy; in the southern mountain region it is dry and rare, and there are abrupt changes of temperature, sharp contrasts between the seasons, and devastating storms; but in both these zones men are hardened by conflict with the roughness of the climate. In Middle Germany, on the contrary, there is little of this struggle; the seasons are more equable, and the mild, soft air of the valleys tends to make the inhabitants luxurious and sensitive to hardships. It is only in exceptional mountain districts that one is here reminded of the <b>rough,</b> bracing <b>air</b> on the heights of Southern Germany. It is a curious fact that, as the air becomes gradually lighter and rarer from the North German coast toward Upper Germany, the average of suicides regularly decreases. Mecklenburg has the highest number, then Prussia, while the fewest suicides occur in Bavaria and Austria.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{concern for}} sustainability and progress of medical research {{has resulted in}} the emergence {{of a wide range of}} biopolymers. The biodegradability of these alternative biopolymers requires investigation prior to their application in environmental and medical systems. This Thesis describes biodegradation of poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) (P(HB-co-HV)), poly(3 - hydroxyoctanoate) (PHO), poly-DL-lactide (PDLL), poly-DL-lactide-co-glycolide (PDLLG) and ethyl cellulose (EC). Polymers were buried in garden soil for in vivo biodegradation experiments and a mixed population of microbes from the soil were incubated in laboratory in vitro biodegradation experiments. In both systems the short chain length PHA&# 146;s degraded rapidly and the medium chain length PHAs and other biomaterials displayed either slow or negligible weight loss. PHB and P(HB-co-HV) copolymers degraded to T 50 6. 7 to 9. 7 times faster in vitro than in vivo. After 380 days burial in soil PHO had lost 60 % of the original 20 mg weight, PDLL 28 % and PDLLG 35 %. Ethyl cellulose and polystyrene did not biodegrade, Polymer-microbe surface interactions were investigated. The faster degrading polymers PHB and P(HB-co-HV) attracted a higher coverage of biofilm than the slower degrading polymers PHO, PDLL and PDLLG for both the in vitro and in vivo experiments. The non-degradable polymers (EC and polystyrene) attracted no biofilm. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated a positive correlation between biofilm coverage and polymer weight loss. Additionally the <b>rougher</b> <b>air</b> sides of solvent cast films attracted more biofilm than the smoother dish sides. Polymer surface changes were quantified with microscopy. Surface roughness of PHB, P(HB-co- 8 HV) and PHO increased during biodegradation, primarily due to an increase in the waviness component for both in vitro and in vivo degradation. In vitro methods provided a rapid mechanism for protocol development and sufficiently predicted both surface roughness changes and biofilm-biodegradation relationships in vivo. PHB and P(HB-co- 8 HV) were blended with the biodegradable antifouling agent 4, 5 -dichloro- 2 -n-octyl- 4 -isothiazolin- 3 -one (DCOI or Sea Nine 211). DCOI leached slowly from the films into the soil delaying biodegradation of the films until a lower residual level of DCOI remained. Biofouling was reduced on PHA films containing DCOI...|$|R
