The performance of the rolling mill depends on the Universal joint shaft through which the power is transmitted to the rollers of a mill.

40|$|AbstractThe {{numerical}} modeling <b>of</b> hot shape <b>rolling</b> <b>of</b> steel <b>billet</b> {{is represented}} by using a meshless Radial Basis function Collocation Method (RBFCM). The physical model consists of coupled thermal and mechanical models. Both models are solved through a strong formulation. The material in the present formulation is assumed to behave elastic or ideally plastic. The model decomposes the 3 D geometry <b>of</b> the steel <b>billet</b> into a traveling 2 D cross section which lets us analyze the large shape reductions by a sequence of small steps. Homogeneous compression and a uniform velocity over each of the cross-sections are assumed. A meshless method, based on collocation with radial basis functions, is proposed to solve the thermo-mechanical problem. The nodal distribution is adapted by Transfinite Interpolation (TFI) and Elliptic Node Generation (ENG) at each deformation step to the new form <b>of</b> the <b>billet.</b> The solution is calculated in terms of temperatures and displacements at each node.

High speed {{wire-rod}} rolling is {{a typical}} large deformation process which includes geometry, material and boundary condition non-linearity, thus it belongs to a highly nonlinear problem. The finite element models <b>of</b> the <b>billet</b> and the rollers in the intermediate rolling region had been established based on actual sizes by using 3 -D thermo-mechanical coupling FEM and advanced contact analysis technology. The deformation field, stress, strain, temperature field and <b>rolling</b> force <b>of</b> the <b>billet</b> were calculated and analyzed in the rolling passes precisely. The distribution and change characteristics of temperature had been discussed especially. The results of the simulation are reliable and precise, which are useful for practical manufacture and the optimization of process-parameters. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{create new}} types of cars, raise their reliability, gain {{operational}} life, and decrease in metal consumption of products {{it is necessary to}} improve mechanical, physical, and also special properties of the constructional materials applied in mechanical engineering. Presently, there are intensive researches and developments under way to create materials with ultrafine-grained structure (the sizes of grains in their crystal lattice make less than 1 micron in one of the measurements). BMSTU developed a manufacturing technology of multilayer steel sheets with steady ultrafine-grained structure based on the multiple hot <b>rolling</b> <b>of</b> <b>billet</b> as a composition consisting of the alternating metal sheets. A principled condition for implementation of such technology is existence of different crystallographic modifications in the adjoining sheets of the composition at specified temperature <b>of</b> <b>rolling.</b> Power parameters <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> are important technical characteristics of the process. Usually, to determine a deformation resistance value when rolling the diverse multilayer materials, is used the actual resistance value averaging in relation to the components of the composition. The aim of this work is a comparative analysis of known calculated dependences with experimental data when rolling the 100 -layer samples. Objects of research were the 100 -layer compositions based on the alternating layers of steel 08 H 18 N 10 and U 8. Experimental samples represented the vacuumized capsules with height, width, and length of 53 mm x 53 mm x 200 mm, respectively, in which there were the 100 -layer packs from sheets, each of 0. 5 mm, based on the composition of steels (U 8 + 08 H 18 N 10). Rolling was made on the double-high mill with rolls of 160 mm in diameter during 19 passes to the thickness of 7 mm with the speed of 0, 1 m/s. Relative sinking in each pass was accepted to be equal 10 ± 2, 5 %. Rolling forces were measured by the strain-gauging method using the measuring cells, located under press screws of the mill. The oven thermocouple controlled a rolling temperature, and two pyrometers Optris CTlaser 3 MH 3 at the input and output parts of the mill made records. Comparison <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> forces <b>of</b> the multilayer composition U 8 + 08 H 18 N 10, which were received during experiment, with the calculated values, shows that with accumulative nature of deformations the real forces <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> 1. 5 – 2 times exceed the calculated values. The analysis of experimental data showed illegality of using the averagely proportional value of the flow limit to calculate the <b>rolling</b> forces <b>of</b> compositions with the large number of the alternating thin layers of various steels. For calculations <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> forces <b>of</b> such super-multilayer materials, a deformation resistance of each composition ought to be determined using the experimental data. </p...|$|R
