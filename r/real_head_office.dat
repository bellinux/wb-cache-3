40|$|Subject of {{this thesis}} are {{contemporaneous}} possibilities {{for companies to}} transfer their seat outside the state of incorporation. Recently, {{there has been a}} dramatic development in private law as well as in national company laws, mainly because of the judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Corporate mobility comprises the possibility to transfer a company from one state to another. Crucial issue is the transfer of the seat of the company in connection with the freedom of establishment. The Court had already given rulings on the transfer of company's seat in several judgments; however, this thesis concerns particularly the latest judgment - Cartesio. In this case the Court dealt with the question whether the freedom of establishment governed by the European law shall be interpreted broad enough to include the right of companies to transfer their <b>real</b> seat (their <b>head</b> <b>office)</b> or their legal and real seats (their registered seat and <b>head</b> <b>office)</b> from one member state of the EU to another. The key question is, whether the Cartesio judgment contributed to the corporate mobility and if so, the scope of such contribution. For better understanding of corporate mobility, the first part explains particular terms used and hidden implications. First part therefore describes the conflict of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The basic aim of {{the paper}} is to {{establish}} {{an understanding of the}} concentration of <b>head</b> <b>offices</b> to metropolitan areas. Our discussion of the locational pattern of <b>head</b> <b>offices</b> in Norway is based on empirical data from a postal survey among the largest companies in Norway and intensive case studies from a selection of these companies. Surveydata are available from 123 <b>head</b> <b>offices</b> (both company <b>head</b> <b>offices</b> and national <b>head</b> <b>offices</b> of multinational companies located in Norway). In addition, case studies are conducted in 21 of these companies. The paper discusses different types of <b>head</b> <b>office</b> location, factors influencing the geographical distribution of <b>head</b> <b>offices</b> and the dynamics of <b>head</b> <b>office</b> location (process of change and stability). There is an extensive literature discussing the rationale for agglomeration of control functions of large companies. A system perspective, inspired by agglomeration theory and cluster theory, focus on the innovative capacity of cities, its institutional thickness and the diffusion of knowledge, and the destiny of “light” institutions (e. g. meeting places and cultural institutions). However, some of these studies tend to frame urban economies in terms of lines and boundaries and emphasise purely territorial sources of competitiveness. In this paper we introduce a new perspective developed by Amin and Thrift (2002). Cities are structured around flows of people, information and money, and are assemblages of more or less distanciated economic relations, that have different intensities at different locations. This implies that <b>head</b> <b>offices</b> must be understood as nodes in an internal, regional and external flow of knowledge and information. Our study brings new insight into the categorisation of <b>head</b> <b>office</b> location. By emphasising the heterogeneity of <b>head</b> <b>office</b> we have identified five ideal-types (historical location, political location, relocated <b>head</b> <b>offices,</b> hybrid <b>head</b> <b>offices</b> and converted <b>head</b> <b>offices).</b> By intensive study of selected cases we have also identified ownership change as the driving force for an evaluation or discussion of <b>head</b> <b>office</b> location within companies, eventually leading to a relocation of the <b>head</b> <b>office</b> or a change in <b>head</b> <b>office</b> status. In addition, we have illustrated that a multi-level perspective is necessary when analysing <b>head</b> <b>office</b> location. Even if proximity is important in the understanding of location, a study must also emphasise the multiplicity of connections that surpass cluster or city level and that are critical for the operation of the <b>head</b> <b>office...</b>|$|R
