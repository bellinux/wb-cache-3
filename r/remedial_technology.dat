50|$|Low-temperature thermal {{desorption}} (LTTD), {{also known as}} low-temperature thermal volatilization, thermal stripping, and soil roasting, is an ex-situ <b>remedial</b> <b>technology</b> that uses heat to physically separate petroleum hydrocarbons from excavated soils. Thermal desorbers are designed to heat soils to temperatures sufficient to cause constituents to volatilize and desorb (physically separate) from the soil. Although they are not designed to decompose organic constituents, thermal desorbers can, depending upon the specific organics present and {{the temperature of the}} desorber system, cause some organic constituents to completely or partially decompose. The vaporized hydrocarbons are generally treated in a secondary treatment unit (e.g., an afterburner, catalytic oxidation chamber, condenser, or carbon adsorption unit) prior to discharge to the atmosphere. Afterburners and oxidizers destroy the organic constituents. Condensers and carbon adsorption units trap organic compounds for subsequent treatment or disposal.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A pilot-scale {{treatment}} zone (TZ) injected {{across the}} width of a carbon tetrachloride (CT) plume effectively decreased the concentration of CT in groundwater at downgradient wells by 97 % within 13 months, with no accumulation of degradation products. The CT plume extends from a grain elevator approximately 2, 500 feet (760 meters) downgradient where it discharges into a small creek; the highest concentrations of CT (2, 500 µg/L) are located near the source area. Chloroform (CF), chloromethane, and methylene chloride have also been identified in study area groundwater. Bench-scale testing was conducted using soil and groundwater collected from the study area to identify the preferred pilot test <b>remedial</b> <b>technology</b> – injection of Adventus EHC ™ across the plume width near the source area to form the TZ. EHC acts through in situ chemical reduction (ISCR) and combines controlled-release, fibrous organic carbon, and micro-scale zero-valent iron. Following injection of EHC into the aquifer, various physical, chemical, and microbiological processes combine to create strongly reducing conditions in situ that stimulate rapid dechlorination of CT and other chlorinated solvents. Groundwater sampling results as early as four months after installation of the TZ showed a 76 % and 88 % decline in CT concentration at monitoring wells located 70 and 140 feet (21 and 43 meters) downgradient of the TZ, respectively. Groundwater sampling results 13 to 22 months after installation of the TZ have shown a 97 % decline in CT concentration 70 feet (21 meters) downgradient of the TZ. Groundwater sampling results 22 months after installation of the TZ have shown a 88 % decline in CT concentration 600 feet (183 meters) downgradient of the TZ. Implementation of this <b>remedial</b> <b>technology</b> as a pilot test has allowed us to achieve cleanup goals. Following implementation of the EHC TZ and upon acquiring groundwater data that document the success of this <b>remedial</b> <b>technology,</b> our client received an approved voluntary cleanup plan from the state regulatory agency as part of a long-term remediation solution...|$|E

However, Sr- 90 adsorbed on aquifer solids beneath liquid waste disposal sites and extending beneath the near-shore riverbed remains a continuing contaminant source to groundwater and the Columbia River. The initial pump-and-treat system proved to be ineffective as a long-term solution because of the geochemical characteristics of Sr- 90.

40|$|Pacific Northwest National Laboratory {{conducted}} a proof-of-principle test at the Fort Lewis Logistics Center {{to determine the}} feasibility of using the innovative <b>remedial</b> <b>technology</b> In Situ Redox Manipulation (ISRM) to treat groundwater contaminated with dissolved TCE. ISRM creates a permeable treatment zone in the subsurface to remediate redox-sensitive contaminants in groundwater.

Once the reducing agent has been given sufficient time to react with aquifer sediments, residual chemicals and reaction products are withdrawn through the same well. Redox-sensitive contaminants such as TCE, moving in a dissolved-phase plume through the treatment zone, are destroyed.

40|$|AbstractBiological {{precipitation}} of metallic contaminants {{has been}} explored as a <b>remedial</b> <b>technology</b> for contaminated groundwater systems. However, metal toxicity and availability limit the activity and remedial potential of bacteria. We report {{the ability of}} a bacterium, Sporosarcina pasteurii, to remove metals in aerobic aqueous systems through carbonate formation. Its ability to survive and grow in increasingly concentrated aqueous solutions of zinc, cadmium, lead and copper is explored, with and without a metal precipitation mechanism. In the presence of metal ions alone, bacterial growth was inhibited at a range of concentrations depending on the metal. Microbial activity in a urea-amended medium caused carbonate ion generation and pH elevation, providing conditions suitable for calcium carbonate bioprecipitation, and consequent removal of metal ions. Elevation of pH and calcium precipitation are shown to be strongly linked to removal of zinc and cadmium, but only partially linked to removal of lead and copper. The dependence of these effects on interactions between the respective metal and precipitated calcium carbonate are discussed. Finally, it is shown that the bacterium operates at higher metal concentrations {{in the presence of the}} urea-amended medium, suggesting that the metal removal mechanism offers a defence against metal toxicity...|$|E

To complete the detailed analysis, order-of-magnitude cost estimates (having an accuracy of + 50 percent to - 30 percent) must be developed for each remedial alternative. This paper presents a methodology for developing cost estimates of remedial alternatives comprised of various technology and process options {{with a wide range of}} estimated contaminated media quantities. In addition, the cost estimating methodology provides flexibility for incorporating revisions to remedial alternatives and achieves the desired range of accuracy. It is important to note that the cost estimating methodology presented here was developed as a concurrent path to the development of contaminated media quantity estimates.

As a result, this methodology is useful in developing cost estimates for use in screening and evaluating <b>remedial</b> <b>technologies</b> and process options.
