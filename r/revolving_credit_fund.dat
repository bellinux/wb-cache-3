40|$|Providing {{credit to}} the rural poor has been a {{continuously}} perused undertaking through out the country to help them solve their economic problems. One {{of this is the}} <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> <b>fund</b> delivered to poor farmers by World Bank through cooperatives and other governments institutions like the food security coordination bureau. The final outcome of credit delivery should be superior enough to change the well being of the rural poor. This is because it may not give confidence for the lending institutions to extend additional credit. Hence, this study is undertaken to analyze the extent and impact of <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> <b>fund</b> on the rural poor in A/Womberta Woreda, Tigray region, Ethiopia. During the study, primary data were collected from 120 members and 60 non members of a multi purpose cooperative. In addition secondary data were collected from the relevant institutions. For the data analysis, descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution and percentages were used to describe institutional and socio-economic characteristics of the respondents. In addition, the t and Chi-square tests were employed to test the relationship of dependent variables with respect to some explanatory variables. A Multiple and logistic regression model were used respectively to analyze factors influencing average annual income of respondents and their repayment performance. Different explanatory variables were included in the empirical model and were tested their statistical significance. Therefore, consideration of the factors influencing average annual income of respondents and their repayment performance is critical because it helps lending institutions to have understanding as to how and where to channel their credit. The amount of loan authorized to beneficiaries is not disbursed on time which may discourage farmers to demand revolving fund. About 54. 00 percent of the sample respondents utilized the loan fully for the purpose initially intended. Further, respondents revealed that lack of awareness; expenditure for consumption purpose and ceremonial expenditure were the main reasons for misutilization of the <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> <b>fund.</b> Variables such as number of oxen owned, extension contact and clients credit experience were found to have influenced the average annual income of the respondents. It was also identified that out of the total respondents 80. 00 percent were non defaulters and only 20. 00 percent were defaulters. According to the estimates of the regression model the variables which greatly affect the repayment performance by clients include age of borrowers, extension visit, off farm income of the borrowers and loan diversion...|$|E

The Household Survey for Evaluation of Climate Change Adaptation Project among Small Producers in Nicaragua, 2014 data were collected by Oxfam GB {{as part of the}} organisation's Global Performance Framework. Under this framework, a small number of completed or mature projects are selected at random each year for an evaluation of their impact, known as an Effectiveness Review. These data were used to evaluate the impact of the project titled 'Climate Change Adaptation among Small Producers'. Beginning in 2011, the project aimed to improve small producers' understanding of the impacts of climate change and to build their capacity to adapt to any changes it causes. Households were provided with seeds and livestock, and with training and technical support. Additionally, the project facilitated the creation of local producers' cooperatives, including women-only cooperatives in several areas. A key element of the project was to encourage experimentation and adaptation in productive activities, through the above activities and the establishment of a <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> <b>fund</b> in each cooperative. The project aimed to have impact on direct beneficiaries, but also indirectly through encouraging participants to raise awareness and share what they have learned. In late 2014, Oxfam implemented a household survey to evaluate the success of the project. The questionnaire was administered to females only, in 101 households of project participants, 76 households of indirect beneficiaries, and 328 comparison households from communities with characteristics similar to those from where the participants were selected. Quasi-experimental methods were used to evaluate the impact of the project by matching project beneficiaries with non-beneficiaries on a range of characteristics. Anonymisation: Names of respondents and contact information have been removed. Community and municipality names have been removed and replaced with codes in random order. The following variables have been recoded so as to prevent unique cases that may allow identification of the respondents: household size (capped at 11 members), age (binned in 5 -year intervals), size of house (removed outliers and capped) and other visible characteristics of property (grouped land area into intervals and capped, combined categories of wall materials). Main Topics : Adaptation to climate change; small-scale producers in Nicaragua...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} announcements of syndicated loans on the share prices of borrowing firms. I use a sample of 5, 465 loan observations reported in the International Financing Review Platinum database to study this impact. Event study methodology is used. My overall results show significantly positive wealth effects on the borrowing firms. However, when I partition my data set into <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> agreements, term loans and hybrid loans, I find that the results are driven primarily by <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> agreements. I also observe {{that the size of}} the event window {{plays an important role in}} identifying the wealth effects for the borrowers. A five-day event window (- 2, + 2) shows share price response to <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> announcements to be significantly positive. A three-day event window (- 1, + 1) reveals that announcements are statistically positive for <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> agreements and statistically negative for term loan announcements. My results are consistent with previous studies in this area. I also distinguish between financial press announcements and information provider (IFR) announcements to cater for the potential for reporting bias. I find that both the IFR and financial press announcements are significant for the five-day window, but only the financial press results are significant for the three-day window. My study is unique in that I differentiate the impact of different sources of information on the market reaction to borrower share price. In addition to the examination of the wealth effect, I also use the structure of the loans to examine the uniqueness of bank loans and their ability to provide financial slack. Specifically, I examine whether <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> loans or term loans or hybrid loans make bank loans unique and their ability to provide financial slack. I observe that out of the three structures of bank loan, only <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> loans allow the borrower to more precisely match the funds acquired with the firm's investment needs and to market time by borrowing at times when financing costs are attractive. <b>Revolving</b> <b>credit</b> loans are positively valued by the market both initially and over the longer term. Bank loans reduce information asymmetry, but the renegotiation characteristics of <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> loans allow borrowers to exploit changes in the interest rate environment, thus providing support for the market timing theory of capital structure. In contrast to puzzling results of previous studies, I present evidence of long-term positive performance following bank loans...|$|R

40|$|With {{the help}} of a {{commercial}} bank in China, we studied consumer credit card debt behavior 2 in correlation with demographics, attitude, personality, and credit card features factors. The study was conducted by using mail-in questionnaires, which were sent to credit card holders who was using or had used either <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> or petty installment plans. According to regression functions, we found that demographic variables and credit card features had limited explanatory power compared to attitude variables and personality variables. Specifically, we found that <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> use and petty installment use were closely related to attitudes about credit cards, money and debt. Risk attitude efficiently predicted petty installment use; however, it did not correlate with <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> use. Personality factors of self-control, self-esteem, self-efficacy, deferring gratification, internal locus of control and impulsiveness were significantly correlated with <b>revolving</b> <b>credit</b> use; on the other hand, sensation seeking, impulsiveness, and deferring gratification were correlated with petty installment use. We also found that some credit card features easily led to an "illusion of income" that facilitated consumer credit card debt behavior.
