40|$|International audienceBACKGROUNDVanilla ×tahitensis {{produced}} in French Polynesia {{has a unique}} flavour among vanilla species. However, data on volatiles and sensory properties remain limited. In this study, the volatile composition and sensory properties of V. ×tahitensis from three Polynesian cultivars and two origins (French Polynesia/Papua New Guinea) were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and quantitative descriptive analysis, respectively, and compared to Vanilla planifolia. RESULTSVanilla species, origins and cultivars were differentiated by their volatile and sensory profiles using principal component analysis. The V. ×tahitensis flavour from French Polynesia was characterized by a well-balanced sensory profile, having strong anise and caramel notes due {{to high levels of}} anisyl compounds. V. ×tahitensis from Papua New Guinea was distinct from that of French Polynesia, having strong spicy, fruity, brown rum notes due to p-vinylguaiacol, p-cresol and esters. Vanilla planifolia showed stronger phenolic, woody, smoky notes due to guaiacol, creosol and phenol, which were found to be biomarkers of the species. Vanilla sensory properties were linked by partial least squares regression to <b>key</b> <b>volatile</b> compounds like guaiacol or creosol, which are indicators of lower quality. CONCLUSIONThis study brings new insights to vanilla quality control, with a focus on <b>key</b> <b>volatile</b> compounds, irrespective of origi...|$|R

The test made use of two beers from the same batch, one made using finings and the other made without. In neither experiment did the use of finings affect flavour or liking ratings amongst the social drinkers (N = 235) tested.

40|$|Herbivore-induced {{volatile}} organic compounds prime non-attacked plant tissues to respond more strongly to subsequent attacks. However, the <b>key</b> <b>volatiles</b> that trigger this primed state remain largely unidentified. In maize, {{the release of the}} aromatic compound ​indole is herbivore-specific and occurs earlier than other induced responses. We therefore hypothesized that ​indole may be involved in airborne priming. Using ​indole-deficient mutants and synthetic indole dispensers, we show that herbivore-induced ​indole enhances the induction of defensive volatiles in neighbouring maize plants in a species-specific manner. Furthermore, the release of ​indole is essential for priming of mono- and homoterpenes in systemic leaves of attacked plants. ​Indole exposure markedly increases the herbivore-induced production of the stress hormones ​jasmonate-isoleucine conjugate and ​abscisic acid, which represents a likely mechanism for ​indole-dependent priming. These results demonstrate that ​indole functions as a rapid and potent aerial priming agent that prepares systemic tissues and neighbouring plants for incoming attacks...|$|R

In this study, the effects of cold storage on volatile ester levels of ‘Hort 16 A’ (Actinidia chinensis Planch. var chinensis) kiwifruit were examined and the changes in aroma perception investigated. Cold storage (1. 5 °C) for two or four months of fruit matched for firmness and soluble solids concentration resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} aroma-related esters such as methyl/ethyl propanoate, methyl/ethyl butanoate and methyl/ethyl hexanoate. Levels of these esters, however, were restored by ethylene treatment (100 ppm, 24 h) before ripening.

40|$|Guava fruit {{are highly}} {{perishable}} and deteriorate within 2 to 4 days. Moreover, these fruit are highly aromatic {{to the point}} that some consumers do not purchase it due to their overly strong aroma. We examined the potential of modified atmosphere packaging and 1 -MCP treatments to improve storage life and reduce the biosynthesis of volatiles. Various quality parameters were also assessed and the aroma profile was investigated using SPME-GCMS. 1 -MCP significantly retards the ripening process, as indicated by greener, and firmer fruit compared to untreated fruit. The main consequence of this slowed ripening was prolonged shelf-life. Moreover, 1 -MCP treatment resulted in a highly reduced biosynthesis of aroma volatiles and significantly altered the odour-volatiles composition. <b>Key</b> <b>volatiles</b> that were reduced were: ethyl acetate, ethanol, hexanal, p-cymene, β-bisabolene, caryophyllene oxide, (+) -α-terpineol, cinnamyl acetate, carveol, γ-eudesmol.
