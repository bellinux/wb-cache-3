50|$|The {{original}} {{cabin was}} built shortly after American Civil War as a playhouse for Martha Berry and her brothers, sisters, and cousins {{when they were}} children. In the late 1890s, three small boys came from Lavender Mountain to this location where Martha taught Sunday School lessons. These boys were uneducated and poor that never heard the Bible. With the word of her teaching interests and kindness spreading, more people came to her for the educational learning. When the cabin became overflowing, Possum Trot day school on the Berry campus was established to continue their education. Possum Trot day school next became Berry Schools, now Berry College. The cabin was once the office for Martha before her new office {{was built on the}} Berry campus. The cabin is now a <b>reserved</b> <b>site</b> near the Martha Berry Museum as The Birthplace of Berry College.|$|E
50|$|A {{portion of}} land was {{set aside for}} a new Post Office {{on the corner of}} Duke and Channon Streets on what was then known as Commissioner's Hill. Due to its {{remoteness}} from the centre of the town, this location received strong protest from the residents of Gympie and a petition of five hundred signatures was sent to the Minister of Works. However, this was ignored by the Government and the erection of the new Post Office proceeded on the <b>reserved</b> <b>site.</b> Tenders for the new building were called on May 9, 1878 and two were received. Both were beyond the expected cost and negotiations were made with the lowest tenderer, Andrew Collins. This included the reduction of the length of the building from 96 feet to 76 feet. The contract was signed on August 23, 1878, however, the building was not completed in the specified time due to bad weather and a lack of skilled labour.|$|E
50|$|To {{service the}} early Roman Catholic {{community}} in Maryborough, Father James Hanley from Brisbane, visited Maryborough and held baptismal services. The first service {{was held in}} August 1852 {{in the house of}} the local chief constable. Towards the end of the 1850s the town of Maryborough developed with the erection of several public buildings including churches, and in 1856 a decision was made by the Roman Catholic community to erect a timber building to house 300 people. The tender of Linklater and Thompson was accepted and the church was ready for use in 1858, though not on the <b>reserved</b> <b>site</b> which was subject to flooding. A new site had been donated to the church by James Cleary and this has remained the principal Roman Catholic church site in Maryborough. The timber building was erected principally as a school house, but used as a service centre when Hanley's replacement, Dean Rigby visited Maryborough.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} selecting <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> cost-effectively, {{taking into account the}} mobility and habitat area requirements of each species. Many <b>reserve</b> <b>site</b> selection problems are analyzed in mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models due to the mathematical solvers available for this model type. Ideally, such <b>reserve</b> <b>site</b> selection models take into consideration the possibility that species use <b>reserve</b> <b>sites,</b> even small ones, as stepping stones to move from one site to another. This consideration, however, is difficult to include in MILP models. This paper demonstrates and evaluates three alternative MILP models that include species' mobility and habitat area requirements. All models include the possible stepping stone function of <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> to some extent, although none does so perfectly. The models demonstrated find spatial reserve networks at lower costs than a non-spatial <b>reserve</b> <b>site</b> selection mode...|$|R

A long distance not only causes response time delay but also increases transportation cost. Accordingly, the <b>reserve</b> <b>site</b> should be located {{as close as possible to}} the demand center (Williams 2008).|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} part of the ethnobotanical work carried out at Margalla Hills National Park, in order to compare the level of biotic {{interference}} among three different sites of the same locality. The community on the sacred site was identified as cacia modesta-Carissa opaca-Oxalis carniculata; on <b>reserved</b> <b>site</b> Acacia modesta-Carissa opaca-Oplismenus burmanii while on unreserved site Phoenix sylvestris-Carissa opaca-Cynodon dactylon community was found. Comparison of the three sites showed a remarkable difference among them. The number of species found on sacred site were less than reserved and unreserved site which suggest more biotic interference on reserved and unreserved sites than on sacred site. The ratio of wood product found on each site was 6 : 2 : 1. The similarity index of the three sites was found to be 10. 86 %. Small qualitative difference in vegetation among all of the three sites and some other observations suggest that the traditional trend among the people to pay homage to the shrines by not disturbing their vegetation is now decreasing due to urbanisation of the culture. ...|$|E
30|$|Decay {{class was}} {{assessed}} for each log and measurement position {{according to a}} 4 -stage classification system (Albrecht 1991, for P. abies and P. sylvestris), modified for F. sylvatica by Müller-Using and Bartsch (2009). Based on the decay class and the associated known wood densities, log volumes assessed in field inventories can be converted into CWD mass and C content (Grove et al. 2009). However, because the internal log condition may not be represented by a visual decay classification (Meyer 1999), large errors can result when calculating C pools on this basis. Therefore, we also assessed the internal density of logs with the drill resistance method (Kahl et al. 2009; see also Herrmann et al. 2015). At each point, where log diameter was measured, two drill resistance measurements were conducted, one horizontally and one vertically. In general, at least one stem disc per tree, representing the dominating decay class, was cut with a chainsaw at a drill resistance measurement position for further calibration of the method and wet chemical analysis. If more than one diameter or decay class was analyzed per log, the number of extracted discs increased accordingly. At one <b>reserved</b> <b>site</b> (‘Lot’) no discs could be removed for most beech logs, as their position {{was very close to}} a hiking trail. In this case, samples were taken with a wood corer (according to the method applied above).|$|E
40|$|Declines in {{the global}} extent and {{condition}} of tropical forests have reduced carbon storage potential and caused biodiversity loss. However, the magnitude of these problems within individual countries may depend {{on the extent of}} the reserved forest estate, and the particular rules put in place to manage resource use in these areas. To test this hypothesis, aboveground carbon stocks and indices of tree diversity were derived for two reserved (highly regulated) sites and a protected public (less regulated) site in the mixed deciduous forests of Myanmar. Aboveground tree carbon stocks were around three times higher in the reserved forests than in the public forest, a difference driven by the near absence of trees > 40 cm DBH at the public forest site. The species composition of large (≥ 20 cm DBH) trees differed substantially between all three sites. In contrast, the species composition of small (< 20 cm DBH) trees differed between the reserved and public forest in the case of one <b>reserved</b> <b>site</b> but not the other. Both species richness and diversity of large (≥ 20 cm DBH) trees was about five times higher in the reserved forest than in the public forest. This was not the case for small (< 20 cm DBH) trees, where estimates of both richness and diversity were similar at all three sites. These findings suggest that both carbon storage potential and large-tree diversity are influenced by forest protection status. This has important implications for national carbon storage estimates as forest protection status is not currently considered as part of the standard carbon accounting procedure...|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the {{influencing factors}} address three aspects: demand point information, <b>reserve</b> <b>site</b> information, and {{information related to}} both (Liu et al. 2014). The information about demand points refers to the geographic location {{and the amount of}} emergency petroleum demand. The <b>reserve</b> <b>site</b> information contains the location and storage capacity. The distance between demand point and <b>reserve</b> <b>site</b> and the transportation conditions also have an effect on SPR site selection.|$|R
30|$|First, {{we define}} two sets, G and F, {{which are the}} {{function}} of potential demand points and <b>reserve</b> <b>sites,</b> respectively. G and F assume that the geographic location of the demand points and <b>reserve</b> <b>sites,</b> the distance between them, and the transportation costs are known. To provide emergency petroleum with minimal time and cost, the problem is to determine numbers of <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> from among the optional locations.|$|R
40|$|The {{debate among}} ecologists on the optimal number of <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> under a fixed maximum total reserve area-the single large or several small (SLOSS) problem-has so far {{neglected}} the economic {{aspects of the}} problem. This paper argues that economic considerations can affect the optimal number and size of <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> and should therefore {{be taken into consideration}} in the SLOSS discussion. The paper presents a tractable analytical model to determine the socially optimal number of <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> to be allocated in a farming area under a fixed total reserve area, taking the opportunity costs of nature conservation (in this case, agricultural profits) into consideration. Furthermore, the effect of land trade and related transaction costs on the socially optimal number of <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> is analyzed. The analysis suggests that in the presence of diminishing returns to farming area, the socially optimal number of <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> (which maximizes social welfare) is generally larger than the ecologically optimal number (which maximizes an ecological objective such as population viability). When the opportunity costs of conservation can be offset by land transactions, however, the socially optimal number of <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> might be closer to the ecological optimum.

30|$|According to the {{principle}} of proximity and the distribution of petroleum resources, the information on 52 demand points and 55 candidate <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> was collected. The optimal <b>reserve</b> <b>site</b> locations for China’s SPR vary under different scenarios. Specifically, the performance of 10 million tonnes of storage capacity is better than that of 8 million tonnes with the same reserve numbers; 13 cities are selected including Fuzhou, Dalian, Shanghai, Tianjin, Ningbo, Daqing, Xining, Xi’an, Dushanzi, Yueyang, Nanjing, Cangzhou, and Chengdu under each scenario. The scenario of number of <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> being {{less than or equal to}} 25 and, meanwhile, the maximum capacity of the <b>reserve</b> <b>site</b> being 10 million tonnes offers the best solution. Thus, policy makers should consider adopting the results of scenario 3 selecting Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, Daqing and Zhanjiang, Chengdu, Xi’an, and Yueyang to take the reserve responsibility in China’s SPR Phase III.|$|R
30|$|In the SPR site {{selection}} model, four important parameters should be discussed. The first parameter {{refers to the}} time the <b>reserve</b> <b>site</b> needs to respond to an emergency demand. In terms of economic and safety considerations, the candidate location can cover the demand point once. The storage capacity parameter of candidate <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> depends on the maximum and minimum capacity. Considering the limitation of SPR storage capacity, two maximum storage scenarios of 10 and 8 million tonnes are discussed based on Liu, which should outweigh the minimum capability (≥ 1 million tonnes). Then, the emergency response time should be evaluated {{on the basis of}} the average railway speed (90 – 100  km/h), so the response range is assumed to 900  km. The last parameter is the reserve numbers. Too few or too many <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> will affect the scheme. This paper will discuss 20 or 25 <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> considering the current status of and prospects for SPR construction.|$|R

40|$|Because {{the threat}} of habitat {{destruction}} can never be entirely eliminated, there is a legitimate concern that some reserve networks, especially highly complementary ones with minimal species overlap, may be predisposed to severe losses in species representation if one or more core <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> are destroyed. In order {{to address this problem}} in a systematic way, we propose the use of two different optimization models for designing complementary reserve networks that are also highly robust to possible site losses. Given limited budgets, the first maximizes expected species representation over all possible site loss patterns while the second maximizes a combination of representation given all sites and remaining representation following the worst-case loss of a restricted subset of <b>reserve</b> <b>sites.</b> By incorporating <b>reserve</b> loss in fundamentally different ways, these two models provide a range of options in terms of information requirements, assumptions about risk aversion, and structural complexity. We compare both of these methods to a more standard approach, which completely ignores the inherent risk posed by <b>reserve</b> <b>site</b> loss. Results confirm that significantly more robust solutions can be obtained for a marginal decrease in initial species representation within the reserve system...|$|R

40|$|In a {{changing}} environment multiple anthropogenic stressors can have novel and non-additive effects on interacting species. We investigated {{the interactive effects}} of fishing and harmful algal blooms on the predator-sea urchin-macroalgae trophic cascade. Fishing of urchin predators had indirect negative effects on macroalgae, whereas blooms of epi-benthic dinoflagellates (Ostreopsis siamensis) were found to have strong negative effects on urchins and indirect positive effects on macroalgae. Based on these opposing effects, blooms were expected to counteract the cascading effects of fishing. However, a large bloom of Ostreopsis led to greater divergence in macroalgae abundance between <b>reserve</b> and fished <b>sites,</b> as urchins declined at <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> but remained stable at fished sites. This resulted from enhanced predation rates on bloom-affected urchins at <b>reserve</b> <b>sites</b> rather than direct lethal effects of Ostreopsis on urchins. We argue that interacting stressors can facilitate or attenuate trophic cascades depending on stressor intensity and complex non-lethal interactions...|$|R
