5|$|On Thursday, 5 September, the Australians {{arrived at}} Clifton for what {{promised to be}} an {{explosive}} encounter. Midwinter did not play for Gloucestershire due to his hand injury but his absence probably counted for little as the Australians took due revenge on the Graces and beat Gloucestershire soundly by 10 wickets inside two days. Spofforth had 12 wickets in the match, taking 7–49 and 5–41 as Gloucestershire struggled to 112 and 85, Grace making 22 and 5. As it happened, Spofforth did not get his wicket, though he caught Grace off Boyle in the first innings. In the second, Grace was lbw to Garrett. Grace could take only 1–90 in the Australian first innings of 183, in which Spofforth, who <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> a score to settle, top-scored with 44. To completely make his point, Spofforth then opened the Australian second innings in which he and Bailey scored the necessary 17 without loss. It {{was the first time}} Gloucestershire, formed in 1870, had been beaten in a home match.|$|E

Many of the researchers who endorsed Shaw and Edwards after the August meeting were now burned in the process. One {{went so far as}} to claim that the young men <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> psychic powers, and that they were now lying about being magicians. The bad press was so widespread that the McDonnell Lab was shut down.|$|E

500|$|Louise J. Winters {{writes that}} [...] "until Shannara, no fantasy writer except J. R. R. Tolkien had made such an {{impression}} on the general public." [...] Critic David Pringle credits Brooks for [...] "demonstrat in 1977 that the commercial success of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings {{had not been a}} fluke, and that fantasy <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> the potential to become a mass-market genre". With Stephen R. Donaldson's The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever, The Sword of Shannara ushered in [...] "the era of the big commercial fantasy" [...] and helped make epic fantasy the leading fantasy subgenre. The Sword of Shannara and its sequels helped inspire later versions of Dungeons and Dragons.|$|E
500|$|Bowie's love {{of acting}} led his total {{immersion}} in the characters he created for his music. [...] "Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David." [...] With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting {{the same role}} over an extended period, it became {{impossible for him to}} separate Ziggy Stardust—and, later, the Thin White Duke—from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, [...] "wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> doubts about my sanity." [...] His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with Ronson's guitar. Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage [...] "retirement" [...] at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973. Footage from the final show was released the same year for the film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.|$|E
2500|$|David Stuart, a University of Texas at Austin {{expert in}} Mesoamerican writing, was not {{connected}} with the discovery, but reviewed the study for Science.

5000|$|Some {{opponents of}} the {{organization}} have grudgingly expressed admiration for B'Tselem's research.

2500|$|Fussi and Paolillo also {{examined}} restored {{footage of the}} infamous 1958 Norma [...] "walkout" [...] in Rome, which led to harsh criticism of Callas as a temperamental superstar. By applying spectrographic analysis to that footage, the researchers observed her voice was tired and she lacked control. She <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> the bronchitis and tracheitis she claimed, and the dermatomyositis was already causing her muscles to deteriorate.|$|E
2500|$|John Van Antwerp Fine {{stated that}} Tomislav's {{northern}} border was the Drava River. South of it he held [...] "modern Croatia, Slavonia, northern and western Bosnia, and the territory along the Dalmatian coast {{from what is}} now Rijeka to at least {{the mouth of the}} Cetina River (excluding the scattered Byzantine towns)". In his 2006 book, John Van Antwerp Fine criticized the relationship between Tomislav's territory and modern nationalist sentiment in Croatia saying that 10th-century sources are unreliable and [...] "roughly a third" [...] of Croatia's perceived eastern land is [...] "entirely speculation". Fine stated, [...] "It is possible that Croatia <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> some of it, but Bulgaria may have had some of it; early Serb entities may have had some of it, not to speak of various župans and other local Slavic lords who in any serious way answered to no one. If the last supposition is true (to any degree), then parts of this territory would not have been held by any 'state.'" [...] While acknowledging the possibility of Croatia having held all the depicted territory and more, Fine stated that whoever controlled the eastern land depicted in Tomislav's kingdom is unknown and should be marked as terra incognita in maps. He criticised Lučić and Šanjek's delineation of Tomislav's eastern border as [...] "nationalist map-making" [...] and distorting the perceptions of children on their nation's history in a way that promotes interpreting later events as territorial loss and fragmentation.|$|E
2500|$|Khrushchev often {{claimed to}} possess a vast arsenal of nuclear-tipped ICBMs, and while disclaiming any {{intention}} of starting a war, maintained {{that he would be}} more than happy to turn a conventional war into a nuclear one if war did come. The U-2 spy flights, which were intended to discover if the Soviet Union <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> the nuclear arsenal that it claimed to have, only started in July 1956, and it was not until February 1959 that it firmly established that Khrushchev had vastly exaggerated his nuclear strength. In fact, the supposedly huge Soviet arsenal of ICBMs, with which Khrushchev would wipe out the cities of Britain, France, Israel, and if necessary the United States consisted only of four Semyorka missiles stationed at a swamp south of Arkhangelsk. From the viewpoint of Eisenhower, in 1956 he had no way of knowing for certain whether Khrushchev's nuclear braggadocio was for real or not. Earlier in 1956, Dulles had warned Eisenhower that Khrushchev was [...] "the most dangerous person to lead the Soviet Union since the October Revolution" [...] as Khrushchev was [...] "not a coldly calculating person, but rather one who reacted emotionally. He was obviously intoxicated much of the time and could be expected to commit irrational acts." [...] Khrushchev later admitted in his memoirs that he was not seriously [...] "thinking of going to war" [...] in November 1956 as he claimed at the time as he lacked the necessary ICBMs to make good his threats.|$|E

2500|$|As an example, Ibn Khaldun {{notes that}} Al-Masudi and other historians {{reported}} that Moses counted the Israelite army as 600,000 or more soldiers. Ibn Khaldun criticizes Al-Masudi {{for failing to}} take into account certain logistics, questioning whether Egypt and Syria could have possibly held such a large number of soldiers, or whether an army of that size would be able to march or fight as a unit. He notes that the whole available territory would have been too small for such a large army, and argues that if [...] "it were in battle formation, it would extend" [...] several times [...] "beyond the field of vision." [...] He questions how two such parties could [...] "fight with each other, or one battle formation gain the upper hand when one flank does not know what the other flank is doing," [...] and that a coordinated battle movement in such a large group [...] "would hardly be possible." [...] He argues that the [...] "situation in the present day testifies to the correctness of this statement" [...] since the [...] "past resembles the future more than one drop of water another." [...] He then compares it to the Persian Sasanian Empire, noting that it was far more vast than the Israelite Kingdom and yet the size of the military of the Sasanian Empire at the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah amounted to 120,000 troops at most (citing the 8th-century historian Sayf ibn Umar). The Muqaddimah states that if the Israelites <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> such a large army, the extent of their empire would have been far larger, as [...] "the size of administrative units and provinces under a particular dynasty is in direct proportion to the size of its militia and the groups that support the dynasty." ...|$|E

60|$|So far as true {{history can}} guess, the Romans <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> kings and drove them out, {{but there are}} signs that, though Porsena was a real king, the war was not so honorable to the Romans as they said, for he took the city and made them give up all their weapons to him, leaving them nothing but their tools for husbandry.
