5000|$|Each Spill {{crew member}} gives their own rating, {{so it is}} not {{uncommon}} for there to be more than one rating stated for a film. At the end of each review, the critics give their ratings. A cumulative score is then posted on the site itself. The rating system is based on means of seeing the movie, from most to least expensive and engrossing, except the highest and lowest ratings. Each film is judged on its own merits, taking into account a multitude of factors including but not limited to its perceived audience, the time of year it is released, its marketing campaign, etc. Ratings are conveyed (in the videos reviews only) by showing a picture of the reviewer and their rating written underneath and a sound similar to a cash register (with a few exceptions, detailed below). To date, Co-Host does not have a <b>rating</b> <b>card</b> due to the current redesign the site and characters are undergoing. However, in recent reviews his rating is listed, but the newer reviews do not have pictures of the critic above the rating. Commonly assumed to be a standard 5-star system, the Spill.com rating system is actually loosely based on a sliding 0-10 star system, with a variety of names and incremental levels, such as [...] "Matinée" [...] or [...] "High Matinée".

Bran was incorporated at 0 percent, 10 percent, 30 percent and 50 percent {{of the weight of}} the flour. The researcher conducted objective evaluations. The data indicated that as bran was increased the cookies became less tender and height decreased slightly. Neither volume nor spread were consistently affected by bran level. A panel of 11 home economists taste-tested the cookies with the different bran levels and completed a <b>rating</b> <b>card</b> for each on various sensory qualities. Another panel of 11 fifth grade students rated the cookies on the basis of overall acceptability and willingness to eat the various cookies. The 10 percent bran level cookie was given the highest rating by both panels. None of the cookies were found to be unacceptable. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|E

50|$|In the {{flat-rate}} model, the advertiser {{and publisher}} agree upon {{a fixed amount}} that will be paid for each click. In many cases the publisher has a <b>rate</b> <b>card</b> that lists the pay-per-click (PPC) within different areas of their website or network. These various amounts are often related to the content on pages, with content that generally attracts more valuable visitors having a higher PPC than content that attracts less valuable visitors. However, in many cases advertisers can negotiate lower rates, especially when committing to a long-term or high-value contract.|$|R
40|$|An {{option is}} {{embedded}} in credit cards. Since credit cards offer open credit lines, cardholders can borrow at the same terms when they become riskier. This option value raises the zero-profit <b>card</b> <b>rate.</b> Furthermore, adverse selection occurs if cardholders are better informed about the probability of becoming riskier {{in the future and}} borrow more when they become riskier. The adverse selection can limit rate competition and keep the <b>card</b> <b>rate</b> above the zero-profit <b>card</b> <b>rate.</b> An up-front fee is not a good alternative because it is also vulnerable to adverse selection. A low introductory <b>card</b> <b>rate</b> is an effective way to avoid the adverse selection problem when asymmetric information is mainly about the change in the borrower's risk profile in the future, as opposed to the riskiness in the present period.
