40|$|AbstractStop valves are {{commonly}} used as fluid flow control equipments in many engineering applications. Thus it's more and more essential to know the flow characteristic inside the valve. Due to the fast progress of the flow simulation and numerical technique, it becomes possible to observe the flows inside a valve and to estimate {{the performance of a}} valve. This paper presents the researches of the authors in modeling and simulation of the <b>stop</b> <b>valves.</b> The flow system with <b>stop</b> <b>valves</b> is complex structure and has non-linear characteristics, because the construction and the hydraulic phenomena are associated of <b>stop</b> <b>valves.</b> In this paper, three-dimensional numerical simulations were conducted to observe the flow patterns and to measure valve flow coefficient and flow fluctuations when <b>stop</b> <b>valve</b> with different flow rate and uniform incoming velocity were used in a valve system. The spectra characteristics of pressure fluctuation on the flow cross section were also presented here to investigate the wake induce of the valve part. These results not only provided people with the access of understanding the flow pattern of the valve with different flow rate, but also were made to determine the methods which could be adopted to improve the performance of the valve. Furthermore, the results of the three-dimensional analysis can be used in the design of low noise and high efficiency valve for industry...|$|R

Design parameters of the capillary valves used in micro sample separator have been analyzed theoretically. It is shown that the pressure barrier of capillary valve design can be better predicted by using current modified 3 -D meniscus model.

5000|$|In Russian trains {{there is}} usually an {{emergency}} brake known as a [...] "stop valve" [...] (стоп-кран). In elektrichkas and other trains it is usually located near the doors, and sometimes {{in the middle of}} the car as well. A <b>stop</b> <b>valve</b> usually has a distinctive red handle. Turning the handle down (counter-clockwise) by about 90 degrees causes pneumatic brakes to engage, due to pressure loss in the standard air-braking system. While primitive and not allowing any override such a system is effective, resembling usual train brake activation; it does not fail in emergency conditions. More complicated systems may not provide quick braking when needed, or during a communications failure. Emergency braking is somewhat risky; it is hard on passengers, and there is a risk of passenger injury if braking occurs at high speed. As a result, use of a <b>stop</b> <b>valve</b> without good reason is prohibited and may lead to fines. Depending on circumstances and consequences, authorities may even arrest a person for the incorrect use of a <b>stop</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{introduces}} a condition diagnosis technique for a turbine governor system. The governor system {{is an important}} control system to handle turbine speed in a nuclear power plant. The turbine governor system includes turbine <b>valves</b> and <b>stop</b> <b>valves</b> which have their own functions in the system. Because a turbine governor system is operated by high oil pressure, {{it is very difficult}} to maintain under stable operating conditions. Turbine valves supply oil pressure to the governor system for proper operation. Using the pressure variation of turbine and governor valves, operating conditions of the turbine governor control system are detected and identified. To achieve automatic detection of valve status, time-based and frequency-based analysis is employed. In this study, a new approach, wavelet decomposition, was used to extract specific features from the pressure signals of the governor and <b>stop</b> <b>valves.</b> The extracted features, which represent the operating conditions of the turbine governor system, include important information to control and diagnose the valves. After extracting the specific features, decision rules were used to classify the valve conditions. The rules were generated by a decision tree algorithm (a typical simple method for data-based rule generation). The results given by the wavelet-based analysis were compared to detection results using time- and frequency-based approaches. Compared with the several related studies, the wavelet transform-based analysis, the proposed in this study has the advantage of easier application without auxiliary features...|$|R
