40|$|We discuss Lepp-centroid versus Lepp-midpoint {{algorithms}} for Delaunay quality triangulation. We present geometrical {{results that}} {{ensure that the}} centroid version produces triangulations with both average smallest angles greater than those obtained with the midpoint version and with bigger smallest edges, without suffering from a rare looping case associated to the midpoint method. Empirical study shows that the centroid method behaves significantly better than the midpoint version (and than the offcenter algorithm for angles bigger than 25), for geometries whose initial Delaunay triangulation have triangle smallest edges over the boundary. This <b>research</b> <b>was</b> supported by <b>DI</b> ENL 07 / 03. We are grateful to Bruce Simpson who contributed to an early formulation of this paper...|$|R

30|$|The {{empirical}} {{approach to}} investigate the underlying factors that hinder {{the development of a}} proper environment to stimulate innovation and innovativeness, and which are responsible for the poorly articulated linkages between NSI actors in Ghana, uses the analytical technique of exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Factor analysis (exploratory and confirmatory) has an unimpeachable reputation as the “most powerful and flexible tools for assessment of multivariate dependence and co-dependence” (Lopes and West 2004, p. 41). Becheikh et al. (2006, p. 650) refer to empirical studies using “measurements of innovation obtained through a factor analysis of answers to a set of survey questions”. In terms of measuring perceptions with respect to innovation—adoption and constructs—Pankratz et al. (2002) and Sauer and O’Donnell (2007) rely on factor analysis for their findings. At the regional level, Martinez-Pellitero et al. (2008) employ factor analysis as a methodological approach, as do Navarro and Gibaja (2009), and Bugge et al. (2011). Finally, the analytical prowess of factor analysis as a statistical instrument for fine-grained <b>research</b> <b>is</b> indicated by <b>Di</b> Stefano et al. (2012).|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presents an}} application of HBIM to the recovery process and design, which allows to highlight some potentialities and criticalities of what has become an important instrument in the documentation and conservation of architectural heritage. The object of the <b>research</b> <b>is</b> the Temple <b>di</b> Bacco, built by Lord Girmthorpe as his final resting place and located within the gardens of Villa Cimbrone, Ravello (SA). The survey has presented several difficulties due to the particular configuration of the site, very steep, with very limited space around the object. If {{on the one hand}} the TLS obvious to the lack of edges of cylindrical objects, on the other hand it poses problems for the tangency of the scan points. The Scan to BIM methodology has proven to be effective and has allowed to overcome the difficulties associated with the conformation of the artefact and of the site, {{in the study of the}} analyzed object. In conclusion, some assessments and results are reported, aimed at sharing and defining strategies and methodologies of scientific validity regarding the application of the HBIM model to a process of recovery and consolidation of an existing building object...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{inquires}} destination image (DI) as {{a holistic}} construct. Unlike the orthodoxy in tourism <b>research,</b> <b>DI</b> <b>is</b> approached from a wider social science perspective. A critical literature review is conducted to critically discuss seminal image formation models. Considering the sociocultural forces and recent technological changes, {{and changes in}} tourism information sources a dynamic framework is presented to elaborate on DI construction. Considering DI as a concept in constant flow and evolution, qualitative interviews is conducted to better understand social constructions of images. To explore influences of sociocultural factors and online information search on Turkey’s perceived images, 32 UK based informants from different backgrounds participated in this <b>research.</b> Participants <b>were</b> chosen through ‘judgmental sampling’. To explore most salient impressions, interviews were designed as three interrelated parts; which are Repertory Grid Analysis, Scenario Analysis, and Online Information Search. The rich data gathered through this flexible design was analysed through Thematic Analysis. While perceived images are explored, dramatic influences of socio-cultural forces are highlighted. Perceived culture in a destination and cultural background of participants are highlighted as highly influential forces in DI formation. Online Information Search is designed to shed a light onto dynamic nature of DI. A critical examination reveals that images hold by individuals who have no prior experience of Turkey tend to be dramatically influenced by online information search...|$|R
