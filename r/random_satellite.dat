40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix molecule tenascin is expressed within the developing peripheral nervous system, first by migrating neural crest cells {{and later by}} satellite (Schwann precursor) cells at the growing tips of peripheral nerves. Here {{we found that the}} neurite promoting activity of tenascin for sensory neurons is developmentally regulated: very young sensory ganglia of stage 23 (4 days old) embryos grew neurites on tenascin as fast as on laminin and fibronectin. The growth response of older (day 7 and 9) ganglia on laminin and fibronectin was similar to that of 4 -day-old ganglia, while on tenascin neurite growth occurred only after a lag phase and at a slower rate. Neurite growth on tenascin was inhibited by antibodies to beta 1 integrin and by heparin. While tenascin promotes neurite outgrowth of peripheral neurons, we found that it does not allow satellite cell migration when it is present on the substratum, and it inhibits migration of satellite cells on fibronectin when added in soluble form. In contrast, soluble tenascin did not significantly alter the rate of neurite growth on tenascin, fibronectin or laminin substrata, although neurites were straighter and less attached. When isolated satellite cells were added to neurites grown on tenascin, they preferentially adhered to and elongated along neurite surfaces. Using patterned substrata of tenascin versus fibronectin or laminin confirmed that tenascin borders allow neurites to pass but act as barriers to migrating satellite cells. We postulate that tenascin or related molecules with dual functions in cell adhesion are important for peripheral nerve morphogenesis. Tenascin allows axonal growth, but may restrict <b>random</b> <b>satellite</b> cell migration into the fibronectin-rich mesenchyme, thereby inducing the compaction of nerve fascicles...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we review key {{properties}} of recently proposed high performance protocols for <b>Random</b> Access (RA) <b>satellite</b> channels for both Time Division and Code Division Multiple Access (TDMA/CDMA) techniques. The proposed protocols by far outperform traditional <b>satellite</b> <b>random</b> access techniques {{without the need}} for quick feedback from the gateway. This makes possible to avoid the utilization of demand assigned capacity for the transmission of small/medium size bursts of packets. A fair comparative performance of state-of-the-art TDMA and CDMA RA schemes is provided together with a summary of their key performance results. It is shown that the proposed enhanced RA protocols, although different between TDMA and CDMA, share commonalities as they exploit iterative interference cancellation at the demodulator side and demonstrate to provide even better performance in the presence of received carrier power unbalance...|$|R

The HTTP client's access to the Internet is via a shared satellite uplink channel.

In a nutshell, tags respond to reader’s interrogation in slots randomly chosen in a frame whose size is dynamically set by the reader according to the current backlog (remaining tags to be resolved). In this paper, we explore the performance of the DFA protocol under Poisson-distributed population of tags when different strategies are adopted in setting the frame length and estimating the traffic backlog. We further analytically characterize the best strategy in the two cases where the frame is entirely explored or a new frame can be restarted at any slot. I...|$|R

40|$|Estimation and {{mapping of}} forest {{attributes}} are a fundamental support for forest management planning. This study describes a practical experimentation concerning {{the use of}} design-based k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to estimate and map selected attributes {{in the framework of}} inventories at forest management level. The study area was the Chiarino forest within the Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park (central Italy). Aboveground biomass and current annual increment of tree volume were selected as the attributes of interest for the test. Field data were acquired within 28 sample plots selected by stratified <b>random</b> sampling. <b>Satellite</b> data were acquired by a Landsat 5 TM multispectral image. Attributes from field surveys and Landsat image processing were coupled by k-NN to predict the attributes of interest for each pixel of the Landsat image.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method of {{measuring}} halo occupation distribution (HOD) together with cosmic growth rate using multipole components of galaxy power spectrum P_l(k). The nonlinear redshift-space distortion {{due to the}} <b>random</b> motion of <b>satellite</b> galaxies, i. e., Fingers-of-God, generates high-l multipole anisotropy in galaxy clustering such as the hexadecapole (l= 4) and tetra-hexadecapole (l= 6), which {{are sensitive to the}} fraction and the velocity dispersion of satellite galaxies. Using simulated samples following the HOD of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), we find that the input HOD parameters are successfully reproduced from P_l(k) and that high-l multipole information help to break the degeneracy among HOD parameters. We also show that the measurements of the cosmic growth rate as well as the satellite fraction and velocity dispersions are significantly improved by adding the small-scale information of high-l multipoles.

40|$|Quantum key {{distribution}} (QKD), provides the only intrinsically unconditional secure method for communication based on principle of quantum mechanics. Compared with fiber-based demonstrations-, free-space links {{could provide the}} most appealing solution for much larger distance. Despite of significant efforts, so far all realizations rely on stationary sites. Justifications are therefore extremely crucial for applications via a typical Low Earth Orbit Satellite (LEOS). To achieve direct and full-scale verifications, we demonstrate here three independent experiments with a decoy-state QKD system overcoming all the demanding conditions.

40|$|Precise Point Positioning (PPP) is an {{increasingly}} recognized precisely the GPS/GNSS positioning technique. In {{order to improve}} the accuracy of PPP, the error sources in PPP measurements should be reduced {{as much as possible}} and the ambiguities should be correctly resolved. The correct ambiguity resolution requires a careful control of residual errors that are normally categorized into random and systematic errors. To understand effects from two categorized errors on the PPP ambiguity resolution, those two GPS datasets are simulated by generating in locations in South Korea (denoted as SUWN) and Hong Kong (PolyU). Both simulation cases are studied for each dataset; the first case is that all the satellites are affected by systematic and random errors, and the second case is that only a few satellites are affected. In the first case with random errors only, when the magnitude of random errors is increased, L 1 ambiguities have a much higher chance to be incorrectly fixed. However, the size of ambiguity error is not exactly proportional to the magnitude of <b>random</b> error. <b>Satellite</b> geometry has more impacts on the L 1 ambiguity resolution than the magnitude of random errors. In the first case when all the <b>satellites</b> have both <b>random</b> and systematic errors, the accuracy of fixed ambiguities is considerably affected by the systematic error.

40|$|Abstract—In initial random access, {{base station}} (BS) {{estimates}} {{the distance between}} the user equipment (UE) and BS. In the mobile satellite system (MSS), however, the characteristics of large transmission delay makes the estimation method used in the terrestrial system not applicable in the MSS. To solve this problem, a two-step time delay difference estimation scheme is proposed for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) multi-beam satellite system. We first divide a beam cell into some layered small sub-areas according to the different delay difference values. Then, two types of Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) preamble burst format are performed: the first one is for the fractional delay difference value measurement and the second one is for the integer part. Further, complete criteria for the designation of PRACH parameters are proposed and closed-form expressions of the system performance are also derived, including the false alarm probability and the missed detection probability. Finally, according to the numerical analysis, the method shows good performance. Keywords—PRACH, LTE, <b>satellite,</b> <b>random</b> access, doppler shif...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} for the computation {{of the first}} neighbour frequencies of DNA's is presented. This procedure {{is based on the}} first neighbour approximation of Gray and Tinoco. We show that the knowledge of all the ten elementary CD signals attached to the ten double stranded first neighbour configurations is not necessary. One can obtain the ten frequencies of an unknown DNA with the use of eight elementary CD signals corresponding to eight linearly independent polymer sequences. These signals can be extracted very simply from any eight or more CD spectra of double stranded DNA's of known frequencies. The ten frequencies of a DNA are obtained by least square fit of its CD spectrum with these elementary signals. One advantage of this procedure {{is that it does not}} necessitate linear programming, it can be used with CD data digitalized using a large number of wavelengths, thus permitting an accurate resolution of the CD spectra. Under favorable case, the ten frequencies of a DNA (not used as input data) can be determined with an average absolute error < 2 %. We have also observed that certain satellite DNA's, those of Drosophila virilis and Callinectes sapidus have CD spectra compatible with those of DNA's of quasi <b>random</b> sequence; these <b>satellite</b> DNA's should adopt also the B-form in solution...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analytically}} and numerically optimizes {{the design}} of a single-gain controller in order to minimize the effects of <b>random</b> disturbances on <b>satellite</b> angular velocity. For a satellite the governing laws of attitude dynamics are well-known. In this paper, these laws are used in conjunction with both the linear Lyapunov equation and stochastic Lyapunov theory in order to derive the optimal controller gain for minimizing the resultant error on the spacecraft angular velocity. This paper demonstrates that the same optimized gain and RMS error predictions can be calculated using stochastic Lyapunov theory as with the Lyapunov equation. This proves a more serious underlying point, which is that the nonlinear terms in the governing equation of satellite attitude dynamics have no effect on the RMS error produced by random disturbances. First, the controller is proven to be stable both in the linear case, when the angular velocity can be assumed to be small, and in the nonlinear case, when it cannot. The RMS error is then calculated under both assumptions, using the Lyapunov equation for the linear case of small angular velocity, and the Stochastic Lyapunov function for the more general nonlinear case. From this RMS error calculation the optimal gain is found by optimization. Both the linear and nonlinear cases are studied and prove to lead to the same resulting optimal controller. Finally, a numerical model is generated in Simulink and Matlab and is utilized to numerically prove that the derived gain leads to the minimal RMS error on the angular velocity. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{constrain}} parameters in galaxy formation theories, especially those for a star formation process, we investigate cold gas in elliptical galaxies. We calculate the detection rate of cold gas in them using a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation {{and compare it}} with observations. We show that the model with a long star formation time-scale (~ 20 Gyr) is inconsistent with observations. Thus, some mechanisms of reducing the mass of interstellar medium, such as the consumption of molecular gas by star formation and/or reheating from supernovae, are certainly effective in galaxies. Our model predicts that star formation induced when galaxies in a halo collide each other reduces the cold gas left until the present. However, {{we find that the}} reduction through <b>random</b> collisions of <b>satellite</b> (non-central) galaxies in mean free time-scale in a halo is not required to explain the observations. This may imply that the collisions and mergers between satellite galaxies do not occur so often in clusters or that they do not stimulate the star formation activity as much as the simple collision model we adopted. For cD galaxies, the predicted detection rate of cold gas is consistent with observations as long as the transformation of hot gas into cold gas is prevented in halos whose circular velocities are larger than 500 km s^- 1. Moreover, we find that the cold gas brought into cDs through captures of gas-rich galaxies is little. We also show that the fraction of galaxies with observable cold gas should be small for cluster ellipticals in comparison with that for field ellipticals. Comment: 6 pages, accepted by PAS...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in both satellite and terrestrial mobile communications technologies are now {{leading to the}} realisation of {{the dream of the}} global personal communications within a few years. Satellite systems, as a complement to terrestrial cellular systems, are introduced into the future Personal Communication Networks (S-PCN) to provide global coverage and to allow global roaming. The inter-working and the integration between the satellite and the terrestrial cellular systems (e. g. GSM system) are the key issues in developing the network architecture and designing the control functions and signalling protocols of satellite systems. This thesis focuses on the design of a satellite signalling control system. The coverage and link properties of ICO 10 and LE 066 satellite constellations, the representatives of low earth orbit (LEO) and medium earth orbit (MEO) satellite systems, are considered. A satellite specific network architecture is proposed to accommodate the requirements of satellite dynamics and resource control function. The physical layer of satellite signalling links are designed to cope with the specific features of LEO or MEO satellite air-interfaces. In order to overcome problems specific to LEO or MEO satellite systems and to provide call set-up control function, three important signalling protocols are proposed for the S-PCNs. The priority based fast access scheme is designed for the <b>satellite</b> <b>random</b> access channel allowing low access delay for the call set-up related access packets, even when the channel load is high. The satellite diversity based paging approach is proposed to optimize the paging performance. The modified selective re-transmission (M-SRT) and Go-Back-N (M-GBN) protocols are proposed to cope with the transaction type transmission on the dedicated control channel. Simulation results have shown siginficant improvement of the M-SRT and M-GBN protocols in call setup delay. Two protocols are also compared in the aspects of implementation complexity and call set-up performance. Finally, the integration scenarios between satellite and GSM system have been examined for S-PCN in the call handling related functions and associated signalling protocols. The GSM higher layer signalling protocols are tailored to provide the call control related functions. The optimum integration scenario is derived under the criterion of minimum modifications to the GSM higher layer signalling protocols and minimum complexities of the control functions...|$|R
