50|$|The F2000 uses {{a unique}} {{ejection}} system, ejecting spent cartridge casings forward {{and to the}} right side of the weapon—through a tube running above the barrel. This method of ejection provides for fully ambidextrous operation; the rifle can be used without any modification by both right and left-handed shooters. This ejection pattern was achieved by using a swiveling polymer tray, which intercepts the empty casing from the bolt face immediately after disengaging from the extractor. As the empty casing is extracted it is held while the <b>rocker</b> <b>assembly</b> tilts to lift it above and clear of the feed path as the next round is stripped from the magazine by the bolt head. The casing is fed into the tray located in a cavity in the receiver wall, which then pivots the cartridge case and directs it into a chute (above the barrel); the case is discarded from the tilting tray by being impacted by a pin on the moving bolt carrier upon its forward return. Only when the ejection tube contains more than five cases is the first of them ejected forward through a port just behind {{and to the right}} of the muzzle. This is continued; every fifth round fired, all five shells are ejected in a burst, until the magazine is empty. Thus a 30-round magazine will be ejected in six bursts of five shells.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{components}} {{are large and}} heavy and specialized tools are required, the replacement process is straightforward and simple. The engine coolant is drained, the <b>rocker</b> arm <b>assembly</b> and fuel system components are removed, the connecting rod is disconnected from the crankshaft, the power assembly hold-downs (commonly called [...] "crabs") are removed, the cooling system plumbing is disconnected, the lifting fixture is installed and the power assembly is lifted out of the cylinder block. The process is reversed to install the replacement power assembly.|$|R
50|$|The oiling {{problem was}} caused by the passage from the center cam bearing to the {{cylinder}} head being offset by an inch and too small. The motor oils of the era were low in detergents, but high in petroleum coke; when combined with short trips and infrequent oil changes, this led to blockage of this passage. This left the lower end with ample oil while the <b>rocker</b> shaft <b>assemblies</b> literally burned up. The external oiler kit essentially provided oil to the rocker shafts from the oil pressure port {{on the outside of the}} engine.|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of a machine called CANIBAL which is capable of simulating {{the actions of the}} human mandible during chewing is reported. Powered by an electric motor, a cam activated <b>rocker</b> arm <b>assembly</b> transmits force by means of wires to each point on the mandible where muscles would be attached. A separately adjustable cam, rocker arm, directional pulley and wire represents each muscle. Models of dental arches cast in dental stone or other materials can be mounted and subjected to extended wear. With different cam settings, wear patterns can be produced which resemble those seen on various fossil and living human dental arches...|$|R
5000|$|For 1949, Cadillac and Oldsmobile each {{produced}} a new V8 design (the Oldsmobile engine was the 303).Both {{of the engines}} were Overhead valve designs. The Cadillac 331 engine featured a [...] "dry" [...] (coolant exited through an assembly attached directly to the cylinder heads), open runner (requiring {{the use of a}} tappet valve cover) intake manifold, rear-mounted distributor, and shaft-mounted rockers. Crankshaft end play is carried by the rear bearing on the two GM engines. It has the lighter 'skirtless' block where the oil pan flange does not descend appreciably below the crankshaft centerline and they both have a partial integral cast iron clutch housing that compares to the early Chrysler Hemi V8 design. 1955 331 engines went to a lighter [...] "flat back" [...] that bolted to a clutch and flywheel housing {{at the front of the}} transmission.This engine features an oiling system which uses a central cast-in passage between the lifter galleries feeding oil to the cam and crank by grooves machined into the cam bores. A single drilled passage per bearing saddle feeds both cam and crank journals. Shared with the Oldsmobile Rocket V8 is how the lifters are supplied oil through small 'bleeds' instead of placing the lifters directly into the right and left side oil supply galleries. Many early racers would replace the Cadillac hydraulic lifter and <b>rocker</b> <b>assemblies</b> with the solid lifters and adjustable rockers from the Studebaker v8 for operation at higher rpm.|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2005 SAE International Biodiesel {{has been}} used to reduce {{petroleum}} consumption and pollutant emissions. B 20, a 20 % blend of biodiesel with 80 % petroleum diesel, has become the most common blend used in the United States. Little quantitative information is available on the impact of biodiesel on engine operating costs and durability. In this study, eight engines and fuel systems were removed from trucks that had operated on B 20 or diesel, including four 1993 Ford cargo vans and four 1996 Mack tractors (two of each running on B 20 and two on diesel). The engines and fuel system components were disassembled, inspected, and evaluated to compare wear characteristics after 4 years of operation and more than 600, 000 miles accumulated on B 20. The vehicle case history—including mileage accumulation, fuel use, and maintenance costs—was also documented. The results indicate that there was little difference that could be attributed to fuel in operational and maintenance costs between the B 20 - and diesel-fueled groups. No differences in wear or other issues were noted during the engine teardown. The Mack tractors operated on B 20 exhibited higher frequency of fuel filter and injector nozzle replacement. Biological contaminants may have caused the filter plugging. A sludge buildup was noted around the <b>rocker</b> <b>assemblies</b> in the Mack B 20 engines. The sludge contained high levels of sodium, possibly caused by accumulation of soaps in the engine oil from out-of-specification biodiesel. The Mack and Ford engines used similar pump-line nozzle fuel injection systems, but a much larger volume of fuel was recirculated in the larger Mack engines. This, along with duty cycle and engine loading, may account for the difference in performance of the two engine types operated on B 20...|$|R
2500|$|A [...] {{supercharged}} {{version of}} the smaller engine {{was added to the}} line-up in February 1987, using the world's first needle roller <b>rocker</b> arm <b>assembly.</b> This generation was badge engineered and was introduced to the Asian luxury car market as the Hyundai Grandeur, giving Hyundai a luxury sedan to shuttle foreign dignitaries during the 1988 Seoul Olympics. As Mitsubishi and Chrysler had a business relationship where automotive technology was being shared and used in both Chrysler and Mitsubishi products, this generation Debonair does have some superficial similarities with the Chrysler New Yorker of the same time period. The Debonair's platform, however, shares nothing with the Chrysler [...] "E", [...] "Y", or [...] "K" [...] platforms. The suspension was upgraded to MacPherson struts for the front suspension, and the rear suspension used a three-link torsion axle. The only transmission available was a four-speed automatic unit.|$|R
50|$|Replacing the {{previous}} Buick Skylark was the Buick Skylark 350, {{available as a}} two-door hardtop coupe or four-door sedan with the 350-cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment. This 350-cubic-inch engine was a different design than the Chevy's 350 CID engine (4.000 in × 3.48 in) the Buick design had a longer stroke and smaller bore (3.80 X 3.85 in) allowing for lower-end torque, deep-skirt block construction, higher nickel-content cast iron, 3.0 in crank main journals, and 6.5 in connecting rods, the distributor was located {{in front of the}} engine (typical of Buick), the oil pump was external and mounted {{in the front of the}} engine, the <b>rocker</b> arm <b>assembly</b> had all <b>rocker</b> arms mounted on a single rod and were not adjustable. The Skylark Custom continued to be available, also using the 350-cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment and still available as a two-door convertible coupe, two-door hardtop coupe, four-door hardtop sedan, and four-door sedan. Buick Gran Sport models continued to be available as a separate series. The Buick Sport Wagon name was now used on a conventional four-door station wagon that no longer featured a raised roof with glass panels over the cargo area, or a longer wheelbase, as in the past. It now used the same 116 in wheelbase as the Buick Skylark four-door sedan and the now-discontinued Buick Special four-door Station Wagon. It became, in effect, a Buick Skylark four-door station wagon in all respects but the name..|$|R
40|$|A project {{submitted}} to the Department of Mechanical Engineering in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the B. S. degree. Department of Mechanical Engineering ME 494 Since the first internal combustion engine was built the design has required a rotating camshaft to mechanically actuate the valve timing. The problem with actuating the valves on an engine with a camshaft is there are many added losses. Turning the camshaft consumes energy from the crankshaft which takes away from the overall power output; also the springs used to close the valves create {{a large amount of}} parasitic losses which take away from the engine performance. Some types of camshafts use a <b>rocker</b> arm <b>assembly</b> that requires many extra parts and adds a considerable amount of weight to the engine. Clearly, mechanical valve timing that uses a rotating camshaft has serious flaws; a new design that gets rid of the camshaft and its accessories could revolutionize the internal combustion engine. There are many companies competing to invent camless valve timing for engines, and all of which are at the basic R&D and prototyping stage. There are no camless four stroke engines being produced and sold on the market today. The objective of this project is to enter the camless actuation race and create a camless valve actuator that is driven by the forces from a piezoelectric crystal. Piezoelectric crystals expand when high voltage is applied to them. The expansion displacement is minimal, but the forces produced are impressive, making it undoubtedly possible to actuate the valves of an engine. Designing a new valve actuator that does not use a camshaft is greatly beneficial for many reasons. By eliminating the camshaft and the associated components, the engine design will be less complex, the overall timing components on the engine will weigh less, and the removed spring will reduce parasitic loss. Utilizing piezoelectric crystals and an electronic controller to actuate the valves and control the timing has the potential to increase the engine efficiency up to 20...|$|R
