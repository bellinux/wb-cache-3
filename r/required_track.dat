25|$|The Caltrain Modernization Program will {{electrify}} {{the main}} line between San Francisco and the San Jose Tamien Station, allowing transition from diesel-electric locomotive power to fully electric rolling stock. Proponents say electrification would improve service times via faster acceleration, allow better scheduling and reduce air pollution and noise. Electrification would also allow future expansion to downtown San Francisco. Electrified vehicles require less maintenance, but electrification will increase <b>required</b> <b>track</b> maintenance by about the same dollar amount, at least initially. The plan calls to electrify the system between San Francisco 4th and King Street Station and San Jose Tamien Station.

In order to avoid the degradation of the urban acoustic environment from ground borne noise and vibration during metro operation, the assessment of the <b>required</b> <b>track</b> types & possible noise mitigation measures was executed, and for each section and each sensitive building, the ground borne noise and vibration levels will be numerically predicted. The calculated levels were then compared with ground borne noise and vibration levels criteria. The necessary mitigation measures were defined in order to guarantee, in each location along the extension, the allowable ground borne Noise and Vibration max. levels inside nearby sensitive buildings taking into account alternative Transfer Functions (TF) for ground borne noise diffusion inside the buildings. Ground borne noise levels were proven to be higher than the criterion where special track work is present and also in the case of the sensitive receptor: "Dimotikon Theatre".

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedProliferation of theater ballistic missile technologies to potential U. S. adversaries necessitates that the U. S. employ a defensive system to counter this threat. The {{system that is}} being developed is called the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) "System of Systems". The SBIRS Low component of the SBIRS "System of Systems" will track strategic and theater ballistic missiles from launch to reentry and relay necessary cueing data to missile interceptors before the missiles reach friendly forces or countries whose safety is a vital interest to the U. S. SBIRS Low {{has a number of}} critical system requirements that for any given satellite are mutually exclusive for the length of time needed to complete the specified tasking. This limitation implies a system capacity on the total number of ballistic objects the SBIRS Low system can track at any given time. Applying exploratory model analysis, the SBIRS Low model uses the Monte Carlo method to explore large regions of the model space to identify key factors in the system and to provide insight into different tasking schemes for individual satellites. The exploratory model analysis, which consisted of 13, 760, 000 missiles being tracked in the analysis of the CSS- 2 and M- 9 missiles, yielded the following significant results: (a) defining the "best" satellite is nontrivial, (b) the SBIRS Low system was unable to initiate a booster track for an unacceptably large percentage of M- 9 missiles launched near the equator, (c) if the system anticipates a long delay in revisiting a track, a stereo view should be scheduled immediately {{prior to the start of}} the delay, (d) mono viewing alone does not provide the <b>required</b> <b>track</b> accuracy, (e) track accuracy is a function of missile classification, and (f) the instantaneous track accuracy versus sensor revisit rate does not fit an well-known probability distribution[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the Quiet-Track project is to provide step-changing track based noise mitigation and maintenance schemes for railway rolling noise in LRT (Light Rail Transit) networks. WP 4 in particular focuses on the combination of existing track based solutions to yield a global performance of at least 6. dB(A). The validation was carried out using a track section in the network of Athens Metro Line 1 with an existing outside concrete slab track (RHEDA track) where high airborne rolling noise was observed. The procedure for the selection of mitigation measures is based on numerical simulations, combining WRNOISE and IMMI software tools for noise prediction with experimental determination of the <b>required</b> <b>track</b> and vehicle parameters (e. g., rail and wheel roughness). The availability of a detailed rolling noise calculation procedure allows for detailed designing of measures and of ranking individual measures. It achieves this by including the modelling of the wheel/rail source intensity and of the noise propagation {{with the ability to}} evaluate the effect of modifications at source level (e. g., grinding, rail dampers, wheel dampers, change in resiliency of wheels and/or rail fixation) and of modifications in the propagation path (absorption at the track base, noise barriers, screening). A relevant combination of existing solutions was selected in the function of the simulation results. Three distinct existing solutions were designed in detail aiming at a high rolling noise attenuation and not affecting the normal operation of the metro system: Action 1 : implementation of sound absorbing precast elements (panel type) on the track bed, Action 2 : implementation of an absorbing noise barrier with a height of 1. 10 - 1. 20. m above rail level, and Action 3 : installation of rail dampers. The selected solutions were implemented on site and the global performance was measured step by step for comparison with simulations. © 2015 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} is the internal project deliverable D 5. 2 - 3 c Results on the Evaluation {{of a new}} HUD design for ACROSS, a European Commission co-funded project. This internal report describes {{the results of the}} first local evaluation. It expands DLR’s contribution to D 5. 1 - 4 Reporting on Testing and Evaluation Plans for Local Test Benches and D 5. 2 - 2 Overview of local technology developments. Therefore, it includes an updated description of the experimental setup, evaluation metrics and test scenarios introduced in the two deliveries. This is followed by {{a detailed description of the}} results of the evaluation exercise. These will be used to plan a new evaluation exercise which will take place in 2015, to be described in an updated version of D 5. 2 - 3 c produced as part of WP 5. 4. The chosen scenario included a take-off with low visibility, in a busy airport, with parallel runways, under time pressure, with some expected event (other aircraft taking off). Performance data was collected during the trials, namely the time it took the pilots to rotate once the aircraft started moving, rotation speed and deviations from <b>required</b> <b>track.</b> Subjective data in the form of questionnaires was also acquired. The post-flight questionnaire was divided in three parts. First, we wanted to know about the general experience during take-off with the new display. The second group of questions specifically addressed the symbology used. Finally, we wanted to know how we can improve the display. For parts 1 and 2 we used a Likert response format, with statements that could be rated by the pilots based on the degree of agreement or disagreement (e. g., strongly agree, somewhat agree, undecided, somewhat disagree, strongly disagree), two dichotomous questions (yes or no answer) and three questions where pilots had to choose the statement with which they most agreed. Finally, part 3 consisted of five open-ended questions, which provided pilots the opportunity to express their opinion. Observer notes and debriefings comments were also reviewed for indications of possible trends or useful insights. The evaluation was successful. All pilots performed the low visibility take-off without problems. Runway centerline was kept and the gear was retracted when a positive rate of climb was established. The pilots maintained an attitude for straight ahead climb after rotation. The pilots were in general very supportive and provided important feedback. This will be used to further improve the display to support the pilots managing workload during take-off. In WP 5. 3 and WP 5. 4 it is intended that the technology will be transferred to the GRACE simulator for overall assessment. Here, the results from the initial PTE will be considered and included in an updated software version. Furthermore, we plan to use eye-tracking data to support the results obtained using performance data and the questionnaires. The Human Factors principles were the main driver of this evaluation. Focus was on evaluating the human-machine interface (HMI), trust, usefulness and whether the pilots were aware of particular symbology aspects during take-off.
