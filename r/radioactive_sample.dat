40|$|Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was {{tasked with}} {{identifying}} and developing at least one, but preferably two methods for quantifying the suppressor in the Next Generation Solvent (NGS) system. The suppressor is a guanidine derivative, N,N&#x 27;,N"-tris(3, 7 -dimethyloctyl) guanidine (TiDG). A list of 10 possible methods was generated, and screening experiments were performed for 8 of the 10 methods. After {{completion of the}} screening experiments, the non-aqueous acid-base titration {{was determined to be}} the most promising, and was selected for further development as the primary method. {sup 1 }H NMR also showed promising results from the screening experiments, and this method was selected for further development as the secondary method. Other methods, including {sup 36 }Cl radiocounting and ion chromatography, also showed promise; however, due to the similarity to the primary method (titration) and the inability to differentiate between TiDG and TOA (tri-n-ocytlamine) in the blended solvent, {sup 1 }H NMR was selected over these methods. Analysis of <b>radioactive</b> <b>samples</b> obtained from real waste ESS (extraction, scrub, strip) testing using the titration method showed good results.

50|$|Gamma {{counters}} {{are usually}} scintillation counters. In a typical system, {{a number of}} samples are placed in sealed vials or test tubes, and moved along a track. One at a time, they move down inside a shielded detector, set to measure specific energy windows characteristic of the particular isotope. Within this shielded detector there is a scintillation crystal that surrounds the <b>radioactive</b> <b>sample.</b> Gamma rays emitted from the <b>radioactive</b> <b>sample</b> interact with the crystal, are absorbed, and light is emitted. A detector, such as a photomultiplier tube converts the visible light to an electrical signal. Depending on the half-life and concentration of the sample, measurement times may vary from 0.02 minutes to several hours.|$|E
50|$|Neutron {{activation}} analysis (NAA) is a nuclear process used {{for determining the}} concentrations of elements in {{a vast amount of}} materials. NAA allows discrete sampling of elements as it disregards the chemical form of a sample, and focuses solely on its nucleus. The method is based on neutron activation and therefore requires a source of neutrons. The sample is bombarded with neutrons, causing the elements to form radioactive isotopes. The radioactive emissions and radioactive decay paths for each element are well known. Using this information, it is possible to study spectra of the emissions of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>sample,</b> and determine the concentrations of the elements within it. A particular advantage of this technique {{is that it does not}} destroy the sample, and thus has been used for analysis of works of art and historical artifacts. NAA can also be used to determine the activity of a <b>radioactive</b> <b>sample.</b>|$|E
40|$|The Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory is a {{national}} synchrotron-radiation light source research facility. The 7 GeV electron Storage Ring is currently delivering intense high brilliance x-ray beams {{to a total of}} 34 beamlines with over 120 experiment stations to members of the international scientific community to carry out forefront basic and applied research in several scientific disciplines. Researchers come to the APS either as members of Collaborative Access Teams (CATs) or as Independent Investigators (IIs). Collaborative Access Teams comprise large number of investigators from universities, industry, and research laboratories with common research objectives. These teams are responsible for the design, construction, finding, and operation of beamlines. They are the owners of their experimental enclosures (''hutches'') designed and built to meet their specific research needs. Fig. 1 gives a plan view of the location of the Collaborative Access Teams by Sector and Discipline. In the past two years, over 2000 individual experiments were conducted at the APS facility. Of these, about 60 experiments involved the use of <b>radioactive</b> <b>samples,</b> which is less than 3 % of the total.

40|$|Abstract: Radioactive {{measurements}} in {{the decay}} process of any <b>radioactive</b> <b>sample</b> can be predicted by radioactive-decay law. This predication is based over its average behavior. In actual practice, the radioactive measurements show fluctuations about the average value. For any <b>radioactive</b> <b>sample,</b> {{there is an}} exact number which disintegrates in any given unit of time fluctuates around the average value. In counting applications, {{it is important to}} estimate this fluctuation because it indicates the repeatability of results of a measurement. This will identify it by using periodogram analysis that depicts the periodicity in the radioactive decay of the given sample of Americium- 241. Statistical distributions that the given sample followed with goodness-of-fit tests are examined. Maximum-Likelihood Estimator (MLE) has been used to find the population parameters. The randomness in radioactive decay has been verified by non-parametric method. These statistical analyses are based over the amount of internal fluctuation in the given radioactive source that is consistent with the predictions obtained. These measurements are obtained by measuring the decay of 300 counts pe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental route for testing {{the existence of}} Lorentz violation in the infrared (IR) regime {{by means of a}} universal minimum speed in spacetime and its effects on time when an atomic clock given by a certain radioactive single-atom (e. g. : isotope $Na^{ 25 }$) is a thermometer for a ultracold gas like the dipolar gas $Na^{ 23 }K^{ 40 }$. So, according to the Symmetrical Special Relativity (SSR), where there emerges an invariant minimum speed $V$ in the subatomic world, one expects that the proper time of such a clock moving close to $V$ in thermal equilibrium with the ultracold gas is dilated with respect to the improper time given in lab, i. e., the proper time at ultracold systems elapses faster than the improper one for an observer in lab, thus leading to the so-called proper time dilation so that the atomic decay rate of a ultracold <b>radioactive</b> <b>sample</b> (e. g: $Na^{ 25 }$) becomes larger than the decay rate of the same sample at room temperature.
