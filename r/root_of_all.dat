The sole concession from the producers on the title was the addition of the question mark. Dawkins has stated that the notion of anything being the <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> evil is ridiculous. Dawkins' book The God Delusion, released in September 2006, goes on to examine the topics raised in the documentary in greater detail.

25|$|The {{distinction}} between dependency- and constituency-based grammars derives {{in large part}} from the initial division of the clause. The constituency relation derives from an initial binary division, whereby the clause is split into a subject noun phrase (NP) and a predicate verb phrase (VP). This division is certainly present in the basic analysis of the clause that we find in the works of, for instance, Leonard Bloomfield and Noam Chomsky. Tesnière, however, argued vehemently against this binary division, preferring instead to position the verb as the <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> clause structure. Tesnière's stance was that the subject-predicate division stems from term logic and {{has no place in}} linguistics. The importance of this distinction is that if one acknowledges the initial subject-predicate division in syntax as something real, then one is likely to go down the path of constituency grammar, whereas if one rejects this division, then the only alternative is to position the verb as the <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> structure, which means one has chosen the path of dependency grammar.|$|E

Gandhara is mentioned in the Mahabharata as well as Ramayana also mentions it as a western kingdom. Gandhara prince Shakuni was the <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the conspiracies of Duryodhana against the Pandavas, which finally resulted in the Kurukshetra War. Shakuni's sister was the wife of the Kuru king Dhritarashtra and was known as Gandhari. Gandhara was in modern Pakistan. Puskalavati, Takshasila (Taxila) and Purushapura (Peshawar) were cities in this Gandhara kingdom. Takshasila was founded by Raghava Rama's brother Bharata. Bharata's descendants ruled this kingdom afterwards. During epic period it was ruled by Shakuni's father Suvala, Shakuni and Shakuni's son. Arjuna defeated Shakuni's son during his post-war military campaign for Yudhishthira's Aswamedha Yagna.|$|E

This sequence mirrored the octave on a musical keyboard: each octave contains eight naturals and five accidentals. Portnoy suggested that they use that concept for the entire album. When writing, the band delegated each song a different key. Sound effects were placed between songs to connect them: for example, [...] "The <b>Root</b> <b>of</b> <b>All</b> Evil", written in F minor, and the following track, [...] "The Answer Lies Within", written in G minor, were connected by a sound effect in the key of F♯ minor. The album's lyrics and song titles featured references to this concept.
