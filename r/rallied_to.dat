5|$|Texas {{place at}} the top of the BCS rankings lasted only one week. On October 29, 2005, Texas {{initially}} trailed but <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> beat an Oklahoma State Cowboys team that had held a losing record through the season so far. Texas retained the top spot in the computer rankings, but not by enough to stay ahead of USC in the overall BCS standings.|$|E
5|$|By 1445 Richard {{had become}} a knight, {{probably}} at Margaret of Anjou's coronation on 22April that year. He is visible in the historical record of service of King Henry VI in 1449, which makes mention of his services in a grant. He performed military service in the north with his father, and might have taken part {{in the war against}} Scotland in 1448–1449. When Richard, Duke of York, unsuccessfully rose up against the king in 1452, both Warwick and his father <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> the side of King Henry VI.|$|E

5|$|During the 1973–74 season, {{the team}} was {{hampered}} {{by the loss of}} West, who played only 31 games before his legs gave out. Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge. Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division. They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.|$|E
5|$|In September, {{over five}} hundred BLM protesters in Austin, Texas rallied against police brutality, and several briefly carried protest banners onto Interstate 35. In Baltimore, Maryland, BLM activists marched and protested as {{hearings}} {{began in the}} Freddie Gray police brutality case. In Sacramento, California, about eight hundred BLM protesters <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> support a California Senate bill that would increase police oversight. BLM protested the shooting of Jeremy McDole.|$|E

At the opening ceremony of the games, Leto was player representative, having been the previous year's champion, and called on players to have good sportsmanship. In the final game, Leto led early 135, but his opponent <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> 1310 before Zyos was able to also rally and defeat him.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Pusan Perimeter was a {{large-scale}} battle between United Nations and North Korean forces lasting from August 4 to September 18, 1950. It {{was one of}} the first major engagements of the Korean War. An army of 140,000 UN troops, having been pushed to the brink of defeat, were <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> make a final stand against the invading North Korean army, 98,000 men strong.|$|E
5|$|The Giants won game one, {{while the}} Dodgers {{came back to}} win game two. After {{trailing}} for most of game three, the Giants <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> win {{the game and the}} series. Consequently, they advanced to the 1951 World Series, in which they were defeated by the New York Yankees. In baseball statistics, the tie-breaker series counted as the 155th, 156th, and 157th regular season games by both teams; all events in the games were added to regular season statistics.|$|E

5|$|The public outcry, {{anticipated}} by the {{consultancy report}} for the Antiquities and Monuments Office, was to become reality.

5|$|This appeal {{caused a}} {{reaction}} from the opposition forces: Odobescu <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> the cause of conservatives, and, on July 1, 1848, together with his fellow officers Ioan Solomon and Grigorie Lăcusteanu, arrested the entire Government. The coup almost succeeded, being ultimately overturned by the reaction of Bucharesters, who organized street resistance against mutinied troops, mounted barricades, and, eventually, stormed into the executive's headquarters. The latter assault, led by Ana Ipătescu, resulted in the arrest of all coup leaders.|$|E
5|$|As with Parcells {{eight years}} previous, one of Handley's first major {{decisions}} involved replacing Phil Simms as starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler {{was named the}} team's starter. Though the Giants won their opening game in an NFC Championship Game rematch against the 49ers, 16–14, they lost three out of their next four games to drop to 2–3. Though they <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> finish the season 8–8, and Simms reclaimed his starting job later in the year, the excitement that surrounded the Giants the previous year was gone. One of the few promising young players to emerge on the team was second–year running back Rodney Hampton, who led the Giants in rushing with 1,059 yards.|$|E

5|$|Camp Morton's first Confederate prisoners {{arrived on}} February 22–23, 1862. Many of the 2,398 Confederates {{in the first}} group were sick, ill fed, and without {{sufficient}} clothing for the cold, northern winters. The citizens of Indianapolis <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> provide humanitarian aid for the prisoners, which included additional food, clothing, and supplies. Local doctors aided the sick and local women provided nursing care. The Athenaeum, {{at the corner of}} East Michigan Street and Massachusetts Avenue, and another local building were converted into hospitals to treat the Confederate prisoners. For the remainder of the war, Camp Morton typically housed between 3,000 and 6,000 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|For Sihanouk, {{this proved}} to be a {{marriage}} of convenience that was spurred on by his thirst for revenge against those who had betrayed him. For the Khmer Rouge, it was a means to greatly expand the appeal of their movement. Peasants, motivated by loyalty to the monarchy, gradually <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> the GRUNK cause. The personal appeal of Sihanouk, and widespread US aerial bombardment helped recruitment. This task was made even easier for the communists after 9 October 1970, when Lon Nol abolished the loosely federalist monarchy and proclaimed the establishment of a centralized Khmer Republic.|$|E
5|$|In 1815, Emperor Gia Long summoned {{him back}} in order to {{suppress}} widespread rebellions in central Vietnam. In 1819, Duyệt was in Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa in northern Vietnam putting down revolts for Gia Long. During this time, he joined forces with a former rebel leader from a highlands minority group in Cao Bằng. This man became Duyệt's adopted son under the name Lê Văn Khôi and his men also <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> the court. Khoi was then propelled directly into a high-ranking post in Gia Định. During the final four years of Gia Long's reign, Duyệt ascended to the highest rank in the court, and he and Pham Dang Hung, another southerner, {{were the only people}} present as the emperor died. Gia Long decreed that Duyệt take command of five royal regiments.|$|E

5|$|Parsons was {{immediately}} fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; {{he insisted that}} his intentions were peaceful {{and that he had}} suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.|$|E
5|$|Phan <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> {{the cause}} of the boy Emperor Hàm Nghithe fourth monarch in little over a yearafter an {{abortive}} royal uprising at Huế in 1885. Thuyet and fellow regent Nguyễn Văn Tường had enthroned Hiệp Hòa after disposing of Dục Đức. However, the new emperor was wary of the regents' behaviour and attempted to avoid their influence, leading Thuyet to organise his execution. The teenage Kiến Phúc ascended the throne, but was poisoned by his adoptive mother Học Phione of Tự Đức's wiveswhom he caught having intercourse with Tuong. Kien Phuc was thus replaced by his 14-year-old brother Hàm Nghi. In the meantime, the French concluded that the regents were causing too much trouble and had to be disposed of.|$|E
5|$|The Giants <b>rallied</b> <b>to</b> {{beat the}} New Orleans Saints 20–17 {{in front of}} 72,769 fans at Giants Stadium in week four. They {{came back from a}} 17–0 second quarter deficit, by scoring 20 points in the final three quarters. Rueben Mayes of the Saints {{returned}} the second half kickoff 99yards for an apparent touchdown only to have the play called back because of an illegal block by linebacker Sam Mills. The decisive points came on Phil Simms's 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Zeke Mowatt midway through the fourth quarter. The Giants dominated the Saints in time of possession, holding the ball for 38 minutes and 47 seconds to the Saints 21 minutes and 13 seconds.|$|E
