2500|$|The root {{may be the}} {{putative}} Proto-Indo-European word *ker/sker, meaning [...] "peak" [...] or [...] "cliff" [...] (cf. Albanian karpë [...] "rock", Romanian (ş)carpă [...] "precipice", and Latin scarpa). Scholars who support this derivation are divided between those who believe the Carpi gave their name to the mountain range (i.e. the name means [...] "mountains of the Carpi") and those who claim the reverse. In the latter case, Carpiani could mean simply [...] "people of the Carpathians". But the similarity between the two names may be coincidence, and they may derive from different roots. For example, {{it has been suggested}} that the name may derive from the Slavic <b>root-word</b> krepu meaning [...] "strong" [...] or [...] "brave". Also, it had been suggested that Carpathian Mountains may derive from the Sanskrit root [...] "kar" [...] 'cut' that would give the meaning of 'rugged mountains'.|$|E

6000|$|But I wish now to {{draw your}} minds rather {{to that one}} word GRACE--Grace, what it means, {{and how it is}} a manifestation of glory. Few Scriptural {{expressions}} have suffered more that this word Grace from the storms of theological controversy. Springing flesh in the minds of Apostles, as did many other noble words in that heaven-enriched soil, the only adequate expressions of an idea which till then had never fully possessed the mind of man, it meant more than we can now imagine; perhaps more that we shall ever imagine again. We, alas! only know the word with its fragrance battered out, its hues rubbed off, its very life anatomized out of it by the battles of rival divines, till its mere skeleton is left, and all that grace means to most of us is simply and dryly a certain spiritual gift of God. Doubtless it means that; but if it meant nothing more at first, why was not the plain word Gift enough for the Apostles? [...] Why did they use Grace? Why did they use, too, in the sense of giving and gifts, nouns and verbs derived from that <b>root-word,</b> CHARIS, grace, which plainly signified so much to them? A word, the root-meaning of which was neither more nor less than a certain heathen goddess, or goddesses--the inspirer of beauty in art, the impersonation of all that is pure, charming, winning, bountiful--in one word, of all that is graceful and gracious in the human character. The fact is strange, but the fact is there; and being there, we must face it and explain it. Of course, the Apostles use the word grace in a far deeper and loftier meaning; raise it, mathematically speaking, to a far higher power. There is no need to remind you of that. But why did they choose and use the word at all--a word whose old meaning every heathen knew--unless for some innate fitness in it to express something in the character of God? To tell men that there was in God a graciousness, as of the most gracious of all human beings, which gave to His character a moral beauty, a charm, a winningness, which, as even the old Jewish prophet, before the Incarnation, could perceive and boldly declare, drew them with the cords of a man and with the bands of love, attracting them by the very human character of its graciousness.|$|E

50|$|The aim of some {{languages}} is {{to express}} deep meaning {{with very few}} parts. For instance, Toki Pona is based on just 123 words and 14 'sounds'. The creator, Sonja Lang, says that the principles are built on Taoism. Another language composed {{along the same lines}} is Papisa-samama which utilises just six consonants and two vowels, has just 12 syllables, making just a 120 word lexicon. It can be read in its own Chinese-like written form or in a pinyin-like, romanised form. Unlike Toki Pona, it has a complex number system based on Roman numerals. Both Toki Pona and Papisa-samama have a small <b>root-word</b> vocabulary and rely heavily on compound nouns, for instance, in Papisa-samama, enlightenment might be translated as patima-tasama-simi, that is, deep-thought-light.|$|E

5000|$|Euphemism {{comes from}} the Greek word [...] (euphemia), meaning [...] "the use of words of good omen", {{which in turn is}} derived from the Greek <b>root-words</b> eû (...) , [...] "good, well" [...] and phḗmē (φήμη) [...] "prophetic speech; rumour, talk".
