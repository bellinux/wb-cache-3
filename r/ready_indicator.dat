Using data for Israeli urban locations, we show that indirectly standardized mortality ratios (SMR) are well able to capture this relationship in small populations for which reliable age specific mortality data are not available; and that they are inversely related to the standard of living, as measured by a variety of census based indicators. It is thus suggested that SMRs offer a <b>ready</b> <b>indicator</b> of living standards in populations for which more specific indicators may not be readily accessible. ...|$|E
40|$|The forest timberline {{responds}} {{quickly and}} markedly to climate changes, rendering it a <b>ready</b> <b>indicator.</b> Climate warming has caused an upshift of the timberline worldwide. However, {{the impact on}} belowground ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles remain elusive. To understand soil microbial ecology of the timberline, we analyzed microbial communities via 16 s rRNA Illumina sequencing, a microarray-based tool named GeoChip 4. 0 and a random matrix theory-based association network approach. We selected 24 sampling sites at two vegetation belts forming the timberline of Shennongjia Mountain in Hubei Province of China, a region with extraordinarily rich biodiversity. We found that temperature, among all of measured environmental parameters, showed the most significant and extensive linkages with microbial biomass, microbial diversity and composition at both taxonomic and functional gene levels, and microbial association network. Therefore, temperature was the best predictor for microbial community variations in the timberline. Furthermore, abundances of nitrogen cycle and phosphorus cycle genes were concomitant with NH 4 +-N, NO 3 [...] N and total phosphorus, offering tangible clues to the underlying mechanisms of soil biogeochemical cycles. As the first glimpse at both taxonomic and functional compositions of soil microbial community of the timberline, our findings have major implications for predicting consequences of future timberline upshift...|$|E

The skills and abilities that children bring to the school are equally {{as important as the}} services and supports that the school brings to the child. The researcher’s intention in conducting {{this study was to investigate}} whether the differences existed in perceptions about ready child and <b>ready</b> school <b>indicators</b> and the implementation of ready school practices between educators working in successful schools and educators working in less successful schools. A nonexperimental, quantitative design was employed with cross-sectional data analysis of educator perceptions collected through a survey. The analytical procedures included correlational analyses and nonparametric statistical tests. The sample consisted of 185 Kentucky educators who included 43 principals, 82 Kindergarten teachers, and 60 preschool teachers. The selection was intentional to ensure that the educators represented schools with scores above the state average (ASA) and schools with scores below the state average (BSA) on the 2011 – 2012 Kentucky Performance Rating for Educational Progress (K-PREP). The researcher found significant differences between the ASA and BSA educator (a) rankings of <b>ready</b> child <b>indicators</b> of health and physical well-being and approaches to learning; (b) rankings of the <b>ready</b> school <b>indicator</b> transition; and (c) rating of the teacher ready school practices. The findings suggest that school leaders, including staff, should consider examining their perceptions of the ready child and ready school, and the implementation of ready school practices to ensure that every child who enters Kindergarten has optimal learning opportunities for successful school experiences...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{approaches}} to Ecosystem-Based Management and sustainable use of marine resources must {{account for the}} myriad of pressures (interspecies, human and environmental) affecting marine ecosystems. The network of feeding interactions between co-existing species and populations (food webs) are {{an important aspect of}} all marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Here we describe and discuss a process to evaluate the selection of operational food-web indicators for use in evaluating marine ecosystem status. This process brought together experts in food-web ecology, marine ecology, and resource management, to identify available indicators {{that can be used to}} inform marine management. Standard evaluation criteria (availability and quality of data, conceptual basis, communicability, relevancy to management) were implemented to identify practical food-web <b>indicators</b> <b>ready</b> for operational use and indicators that hold promise for future use in policy and management. The major attributes of the final suite of operational food-web indicators were structure and functioning. Indicators that represent resilience of the marine ecosystem were less developed. Over 60 potential food-web indicators were evaluated and the final selection of operational food-web indicators includes: the primary production required to sustain a fishery, the productivity of seabirds (or charismatic megafauna), zooplankton indicators, primary productivity, integrated trophic indicators, and the biomass of trophic guilds. More efforts should be made to develop thresholds-based reference points for achieving Good Environmental Status. There is also a need for international collaborations to develop indicators that will facilitate management in marine ecosystems used by multiple countries. JRC.

40|$|Sagalassos is {{an ancient}} Pisidian city, located on a south-facing {{mountain}} slope of the Western Taurus mountains in Southwest Anatolia. The city has been inhabited from Classical to Mid Byzantine times, with Late Hellenistic to Early Byzantine times (2 nd century BC until the 7 th century AD) representing its most intensive period of occupation. Sagalassos {{has been the subject}} of ongoing archaeology-driven research since 1986, first as part of the Pisidia Survey Project and from 1989 onwards as subject of the Sagalassos Archaeological Research Project (SARP). Professor Marc Waelkens directed the project between 1989 and 2013; professor Jeroen Poblome from 2014 onwards. The past decades have provided a treasure of information on the history and layout of Sagalassos and its territory, among which the so-called Potters’ Quarter (now referred to as Eastern Suburbium) northeast of the town. In 2010, professors Jeroen Poblome and Patrick Degryse jointly devised a new research project on the Eastern Suburbium of Sagalassos, a topographically, historically and functionally distinctive suburban development in the immediate periphery of the town of Sagalassos. They envisaged an interdisciplinary research programme that would allow us to map the origins of this ‘peri-urban phenomenon’ and its emerging and decreasing functionalities, to unravel its developing social complexity and to approach the general study area of ancient urbanism from a ‘suburban point of view’. Since the study area also harboured the main artisanal quarter of the city, it was expected to hold potential for the documentation of the area’s importance within the regional economy. The main modules for this thesis consisted of the various, mostly unpublished, excavation and survey data from previous campaigns, augmented with new research data (2011 - 2014) collected within the area aimed at answering specific (open) research questions. Because of its location on a high plateau northeast of the city, the Eastern Suburbium is an area that is topographically segregated from both the rest of the town as well as from its surrounding territory. The suburban setting and topographical characteristics of the area resulted into the formation of a suburban texture that is clearly distinguishable in its historical development, layout and attested functionalities. A quarter century of research had yielded a lot of information on this site, but a thorough study of its many facets was still lacking. This project therefore aimed at gathering all available data, filling the remaining knowledge gaps with additional field work, identifying the nature of this suburban ‘phenomenon’ and presenting the data of all previous, current and ongoing research in an integrated, exhaustive and accessible manner. Even though the expertise on the Eastern Suburbium was already considerable due to the varied results from previous campaigns, the first major task consisted of combining all available, but fragmented, old and new data into a comprehensive history of the study area. This approach also led to a reassessment and ultimately to a reinterpretation of our knowledge on all historical and functional aspects of the various sites throughout the Eastern Suburbium. From Hellenistic times onwards the area overlaps to a large extent with the Eastern Necropolis, but the burial practices are mainly concentrated along the steeper, rocky slopes surrounding the area. The central part of the area would develop, from Augustan times onwards, into the main artisanal quarter of the city. Until now only pottery production activities have been conclusively attested within the Eastern Suburbium, but the presence of other crafts (glass working, metallurgy, textile dying, etc.) has been suggested. Specific zones within and in the immediate surroundings of the study area were also used for clay quarrying (the Central Depression), for stone quarrying (the largest eastern quarry is located in the southeast of the Eastern Suburbium) and sarcophagus carving (immediately south of the Central Depression). Finally, the southwestern quarter of the area was taken up between c. 50 AD and c. 350 AD by a series of (semi-) public structures and complexes. Communal dining has been attested at the PQ 2 site, which is tentatively identified as a schola, and we hypothesise the identification of the site G complex as a multi-purpose suburban campus, where for example cattle markets and festivals could be organised. Even though the area covers a geographically distinguishable terrain, the area forms part of the continentia aedificia (the continuously built-up sprawl outside the city walls). In a more broad sense we can refer to the study region as a proasteion (mainly used in the Greek East) or suburbium (mainly used in the Latin West). The problem with these terms is that both also refer to the wider area surrounding an ancient city, including the part of the countryside defined by (elite) villae and suburban farms. This study further recognises a complex framework of different interacting ‘levels of urbanisation’, ranging from the monumental city centre to the desolate mountain slopes, with many different, though partially permeable, levels in between. While the boundaries between these zones were never definite, they appear to increasingly dissolve from Late Roman times onwards. The 7 th century AD earthquake would signify a breaking point for the urban texture in the centre of the city, but it appears that the Eastern Suburbium was already to a large extent abandoned in the preceding century. The demise of the quarter was the end station of a longer process, which included, consecutively, the gradual accumulation of waste, the abandonment of the (semi-) public southwestern quarter, the usurpation of older burial monuments, the dismantlement of derelict structures, the return of agricultural and pastoral activities in the area and the removal of the potting activities to a yet unknown location in the countryside. The final major intervention within the proasteion was the erection of an Early Byzantine church on the top of the eastern ridge, but also this building appears to have been emptied before it eventually collapsed in the 7 th century AD. The history of this quarter could be reconstructed in some detail from Classical/Hellenistic times to the so-called ‘Dark Ages’, thus covering a period of more than 1, 000 years. This study will hopefully serve as the onset for future research, as some (socio-economic) aspects deserve a more thorough approach.
