The development of the self-administered online questionnaire for the assessment of familial and hereditary CRC risk was based on nationwide criteria for referral to genetic specialists due to a Lynch syndrome suspicion, as well as existing criteria for surveillance colonoscopies because of an increased risk of familial CRC. The questionnaire was validated at a private colonoscopy center. Patients scheduled for colonoscopy were enrolled (n = 150).

The program allows facilities to purchase outpatient drugs at prices below market. Because the Prospective Payment System payment rates for drugs furnished to hospital outpatients are the same for all hospitals without regard to whether the drugs were purchased through the 340B program, hospitals have an incentive to increase margins by expanding their patient base for chemotherapy administration. At the same time, changes in Medicare payments for chemotherapy drugs furnished in offices have limited the ability of oncologists to profit on these drugs and have increased the attractiveness of affiliating with a hospital." ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} paediatric cardiac {{services in}} South Africa {{with respect to}} <b>referral</b> <b>base,</b> services provided and human resources. STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive study design was used. An audit of the <b>referral</b> <b>base,</b> personnel and activity of paediatric cardiac units throughout South Africa was conducted {{by means of a}} questionnaire. A specialist from each centre was asked to provide the relevant data. Where accurate data was not available, estimates were provided by practitioners within each centre. RESULTS: All identified units participated in the audit. Three were private sector units while the other five were primarily public sector units. Twenty four paediatric cardiologists, equally distributed between public and private sector units, were practicing in the country as at end 2008, with a further eight paediatricians undergoing training in paediatric cardiology. This is significantly less than the 88 paediatric cardiologists required for the population of South Africa. Eight paediatric cardiac surgeons were operating predominantly on children in public hospitals and five in private institutions. An estimated 1370 operations for congenital heart disease were performed over a one year period, with 800 of these in the public sector. Extrapolating from accepted estimates of congenital heart disease incidence, this represents conservatively, less that 40 % of operations required for the population. Additionally, only 26 % of the estimated 114 simple transposition of great arteries born annually were operated on, indicating serious deficiencies in the ability to adequately detect and intervene in serious congenital heart disease presenting in the neonatal period. CONCLUSION: The infrastructure and resources to detect and manage heart disease in children in South Africa, particularly within the public sector, are grossly inadequate...|$|E

40|$|The {{operation}} of hospitals in a low-risk state {{has become more}} a more challenging goal to meet as cost-of-care increases have forced hospitals to find alternative revenue sources. In particular, hospitals have compensated for increasing costs by expanding their ad hoc patient <b>referral</b> <b>base</b> and overloading their operation schedules without a corresponding increase in resources to treat the increased patient load. Without adequate resources to treat patients, proceduralists respond to throughput pressure by speeding up the pace of cases, thereby exposing the patient to greatly increased risk of an adverse event.
