5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue in order to {{supplement}} and increase royal income in a time when new demands were being made on royal finances. Although derived from the older danegeld, carucage was an experiment in <b>revenue</b> <b>collection,</b> but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a regularly assessed tax. Also new was the fact later collections were imposed with the consent of the barons. However, the main flow of royal income was from other sources, and carucage was not collected again after 1224.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{under the}} toll {{collection}} regime of the HRBC, daily traffic was recorded to be {{a minimum of}} 28,000 vehicles and a maximum of 39,000 vehicles in 2000, but fell {{to a maximum of}} around 30,000 vehicles by December 2002, when the management of the toll plaza was handed over to a private firm. Subsequently, the daily traffic reached a minimum of 45,000 vehicles and a maximum of 61,000 vehicles by early 2008, against a maximum capacity of 85,000 vehicles per day. The original management of the toll <b>revenue</b> <b>collection</b> by HRBC was consequently criticized for corruption and significant loss of revenue.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} in Regina struggled to deliver {{services to the}} vast territory. The influx of settlers and responsibility for the Klondike, as well as constant fighting {{with the federal government}} over limited legislative powers and minimal <b>revenue</b> <b>collection,</b> hampered the effectiveness of government. The government during this period slowly released powers to the elected members. In 1897, after control of the executive council was ceded to elected members from the Lieutenant-Governors, a short-lived period of party politics evolved that challenged the consensus model of government that had been used since 1870.|$|E

5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue to {{supplement}} existing sources of income. It was also intended to increase the royal revenues in the face of new demands placed upon them. Although derived from the older geld, carucage was an experiment in <b>revenue</b> <b>collection,</b> but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a general tax regularly assessed. A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and other leading members of the ruling classes. Despite its intermittent use during the reigns of Richard I, John, and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income at that time remained scutage, feudal dues such as feudal reliefs or feudal aids, and royal rights such as the profits from the justice system.|$|E

5|$|In 1918, Kheda {{was hit by}} {{floods and}} famine and the {{peasantry}} was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel. Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win {{public support for the}} agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused but finally in end-May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended <b>revenue</b> <b>collection</b> and released all the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Rosas' early {{administration}} was {{preoccupied with the}} severe deficits, large public debts {{and the impact of}} currency devaluation which his government inherited. A great drought that began in December 1828, which would last until April 1832, greatly impacted the economy. The Unitarians were still at large, controlling several provinces that had banded together in the Unitarian League. The capture of José María Paz, the main Unitarian leader, in March 1831 resulted in the end of the Unitarian–Federalist civil war and the collapse of the Unitarian League. Rosas was content, for the moment, to agree to recognize provincial autonomy in the Federal Pact. In an effort to alleviate the government's financial problems, he improved <b>revenue</b> <b>collection</b> while not raising taxes and curtailed expenditure.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the war, the power of the British East India Company was on the rise, whereas the Maratha Empire was on the decline (although they had only ruled for a very short duration, may be the reason was they never had {{intellectual}} capabilities and could only defeat Mughals when there was no great king left) The British had been victorious in the previous Anglo-Maratha war and Hindu Brahmin Marathas were at their mercy. The Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at this time was Baji Rao II. Several Maratha leaders who had formerly sided with the Peshwa were now under British control or protection. The British had an arrangement with the Gaekwad dynasty of the Maratha province of Baroda to prevent the Peshwa from collecting revenue in that province. Gaekwad sent an envoy to the Peshwa in Pune to negotiate a dispute regarding <b>revenue</b> <b>collection.</b> The envoy, Gangadhar Shastri, was under British protection. He was murdered, and the Peshwa's minister Trimbak Dengle was suspected of the crime.|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews some of {{the main}} issues with {{intergovernmental}} transfers in Latin America. The analysis is set {{against the backdrop of the}} basic normative principles of revenue assignments and the practice of sub-national government financing in the region. Own <b>revenue</b> <b>collections</b> and an equalization transfer program are key components of a sound sub-national fiscal structure. However, in most Latin American countries own <b>revenue</b> <b>collections</b> represent a minor share of sub-national revenues and equalization programs, if present, are generally not properly designed. Instead, sub-national finances in the region heavily rely on revenue sharing schemes with often multiple and unclear objectives and with negative effects on equity and economic efficiency. In this paper we provide a critical analysis of those revenue sharing schemes utilized in Latin America, and propose an alternative approach to the structuring of the transfer systems and more generally of the sub-national revenue systems in the region. ...|$|R

However, {{the economy is}} still highly indebted and is currently faced with a public debt of over US$ 1, 960 million, translating into about 69 % of total tax <b>revenue</b> <b>collections.</b> While there have been considerable changes in policy and adoption of Structural Adjustment Programs, in particular, the liberalization of trade in the early 1990 s, the adoption of Universal Primary Education in 1997 and Universal Secondary Education in 2007 among others, the current focus of government includes the improvement of tax administration and enhancement of tax compliance. The study explores the impact of changes in various macro-economic indicators on direct tax <b>revenue</b> <b>collections,</b> highlighting the distinctive ways through which these interact to determine the level of tax revenue and thus {{how it could be}} boosted. The variables include; inflation rate, public investment, private investment, and labor force. A multiple regression model was estimated using Ordinary Least Squares method. The distributions of the major variables of interest were reviewed using the Jacque-Bera statistic before drawing final conclusions, although it is assumed in multiple regressions, that the residuals are normally distributed. The results confirm normal distribution of variables, the existence of a strong multicollinearity among the variables, and trended series of the different direct tax components. Also according to the findings, investment has the biggest impact on the level of direct taxes in the economy, with private investment having a positive effect and public investment having a negative impact.

5|$|The Peshwa's territories were {{absorbed into}} the Bombay Presidency and the {{territory}} seized from the Pindaris became the Central Provinces of British India. The princes of Rajputana became symbolic feudal lords who accepted the British as the paramount power. Thus Francis Rawdon-Hastings redrew the map of India to a state which remained more or less unaltered until the time of Lord Dalhousie. The British brought an obscure descendant of Shivaji, {{the founder of the}} Maratha Empire, to be the ceremonial head of the Maratha Confederacy to replace the seat of the Peshwa. An infant from the Holkar family was appointed as the ruler of Nagpur under British guardianship. The Peshwa adopted a son, Nana Sahib, who went on {{to be one of the}} leaders of the Rebellion of 1857. After 1818, Montstuart Elphinstone reorganized the administrative divisions for <b>revenue</b> <b>collection,</b> thus reducing the importance of the Patil, the Deshmukh, and the Deshpande. The new government felt a need to communicate with the local Marathi-speaking population; Elphinstone pursued a policy of planned standardization of the Marathi language in the Bombay Presidency starting after 1820.|$|E
5|$|As chief {{financial}} administrator, he bore {{the brunt of}} the chronicler's condemnations for extortion and efforts to increase royal revenues. Besides attempts to increase the efficiency of collection and the rate of taxation, Ranulf created new methods of raising money. One of his new measures in <b>revenue</b> <b>collection</b> came in 1094, when the fyrd, or English militia, was assembled to fight in Normandy against the king's brother Robert Curthose. When all the men had assembled, instead of sending them to Normandy, Ranulf dismissed them, after collecting the 10 shillings that each man had been given by their district for maintenance. Ranulf then spent the money on mercenaries. Ranulf also actively pressed lawsuits, including bringing suit against Anselm on the day of Anselm's consecration as Archbishop of Canterbury. Another innovation was the attempt to collect a relief, much like the relief due from vassals at the death of an overlord, from the under-tenants of church lands when the church office changed hands. This attempt came at the death of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester in 1095, when the king sent writs to the free tenants of the bishop, setting the amount of relief owed to the king. This attempt was not repeated, however.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Caliphate's fiscal basis had shrunk {{dramatically}} {{after so many}} tax-paying provinces had been lost from the central government's control. The caliphal government was now increasingly reliant on the revenue of the Sawad and the other areas of lower Iraq, which were witnessing a rapid decline in agricultural productivity due to the disruption of the civil wars and neglect of the irrigation network. In the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809) the Sawad had provided an annual revenue of 102,500,000 dirhams, {{more than double the}} revenue of Egypt and three times that of Syria; by the early 10th century it was providing {{less than a third of}} that figure. The situation was further exacerbated by the fact that in the remaining provinces, semi-autonomous governors, grandees and members of the dynasty were able to establish virtual latifundia, aided by the system of muqāṭa'a, a form of tax farming in exchange for a fixed tribute, which they often failed to pay. To maximise their revenue from the territory remaining to them, the Abbasids increased the breadth and complexity of the central bureaucracy, dividing the provinces into smaller tax districts as well as increasing the number of the fiscal departments (dīwāns), allowing for close oversight of both <b>revenue</b> <b>collection</b> and the activities of the officials themselves.|$|E
