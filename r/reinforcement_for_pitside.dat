40|$|I {{conducted}} two {{experiments to}} test {{the effects of the}} acquisition of conditioned <b>reinforcement</b> <b>for</b> observing adult faces and conditioned <b>reinforcement</b> <b>for</b> listening to adult voices on rate of learning and attention to the presence of adults using a delayed multiple probe design across participants and behaviors. In Experiment 1, two participants with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) participated and the dependent variables were: (1) learn-units-to-criterion across speaker and listener programs based on 1000 learn units respectively (2) attention to the presence of adults prior to and following pre- and post-intervention probe sessions. The independent variable was the acquisition of conditioned <b>reinforcement</b> <b>for</b> observing the human face and the acquisition of conditioned <b>reinforcement</b> <b>for</b> listening to adult voices using the conjugate stimulus-stimulus pairing protocol. In Experiment 2, there were four participants in this study diagnosed with ASD. The dependent variables were learn units to criteria across speaker and listener programs, observing responses, and verbal operants emitted by the participants across three settings. In Experiment 1, the results showed Participant A's rate of learning accelerated after the first intervention and decreased after the second intervention. Participant A's attention to the presence of adults increased after the first intervention and slightly decreased after the second. For Participant B when the acquisition of conditioned <b>reinforcement</b> <b>for</b> faces and conditioned <b>reinforcement</b> <b>for</b> listening to voices were in repertoire rate of learning and attention to the presence of adults accelerated. In Experiment 2, the results indicated that the acquisition of conditioned <b>reinforcement</b> <b>for</b> observing adult faces and/or voices increased rate of learning, attending to adults present in the environment, and verbal operants for all four participants...|$|R

50|$|Time-out is one {{behavior}} {{control method}} based on removing positive <b>reinforcement</b> <b>for</b> a brief time. Less elaborate methods {{from the same}} class like tactical ignoring, or planned ignoring, also can be effective in cases where parental/care-giver attention is the positive <b>reinforcement</b> <b>for</b> negative behavior. This class of methods are more effective if the child gets a significant amount positive <b>reinforcement</b> (praise, attention) <b>for</b> good behavior. All punishment procedures can evoke other problem behaviors, damage rapport, or evoke escape or avoidant behaviors. For this, and other ethical reasons, behavior analysts exhaust all options <b>for</b> using differential <b>reinforcement</b> and/or extinction procedures to reduce problem behavior, before considering the use of punishment procedures.|$|R
40|$|Given the {{effectiveness}} of putative escape extinction as treatment for feeding problems, {{it is surprising that}} {{little is known about the}} effects of escape as <b>reinforcement</b> <b>for</b> appropriate eating during treatment. In the current investigation, we examined {{the effectiveness}} of escape as <b>reinforcement</b> <b>for</b> mouth clean (a product measure of swallowing), escape as <b>reinforcement</b> <b>for</b> mouth clean plus escape extinction (EE), and EE alone as treatment for the food refusal of 5 children. Results were similar to those of previous studies, in that reinforcement alone did not result in increases in mouth clean or decreases in inappropriate behavior (e. g., Piazza, Patel, Gulotta, Sevin, & Layer, 2003). Increases in mouth clean and decreases in inappropriate behavior occurred when the therapist implemented EE independent of the presence or absence of reinforcement. Results are discussed in terms of the role of negative reinforcement in the etiology and treatment of feeding problems...|$|R
