In this game, no education of proposers is possible. A control experiment with informed proposers was also conducted. We observe high <b>rejection</b> <b>rates</b> with covered response. These are explained by responders' resistance to unfairness. But the <b>rejection</b> <b>rates</b> are lower than in the control group, due to the lacking possibility of educative punishment.

Results showed that the GE membrane was selected through comparing membrane flux and pollutants rejections, and its optimal conditions were at transmembrane pressure (TMP) of 10 bar and pH of 5. 0. Under these optimized conditions, the permeate flux reached 64. 7 L/h m(2), and the <b>rejection</b> <b>rates</b> of total organic carbon, chemical oxygen demand, UV 254, color, and turbidity were 99. 3, 91. 8, 91. 5, 100, and 87. 2 %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{we address}} the problem of {{performance}} evaluation in biometric verification systems. By formulating the optimum Bayesian decision criterion for a verification system and by assuming the data distributions to be multinormals, we derive two statistical expressions for calculating theoretically the false acceptance and false <b>rejection</b> <b>rates.</b> Generally, the adoption of a Bayesian parametric model does not allow for obtaining explicit expressions for the calculation of the system errors. As far as biometric verification systems are concerned, some hypotheses can be reasonably adopted, thus allowing simple and affordable expressions to be derived. By using two verification system prototypes, based on hand shape and human face, respectively, we show our results are well founded.
