Jim Ridolfo coined the term rhetorical velocity to explain a conscious concern for the distance, speed, time, and travel it will take for a third party to rewrite an original composition. The use of <b>recomposition</b> allows for an audience {{to be involved in}} a public conversation, adding their own intentionality to the original product. This new method of editing and remediation is attributed to the evolution of digital text and publication, giving technology an important role in writing and composition.|$|E

Also the composite sinusoidal modeling (CSM) used on a singing speech synthesis feature on Yamaha CX5M (1984), is known to use a similar approach which was independently developed during 19661979.

In the introductory paper submitted by the Palermo Unit, Andrea Sciascia transforms the results reached in the incipit allowing us to assess the entire path followed by the research excursus. A thorough examination {{has been carried out}} on the final plans, the so-called <b>recompositions</b> stemming from the the merging of a number of projects on the two neighbourhoods under study: Borgo Ulivia and ZEN. The reflection starts from a specific verb: densifying.

These facilities are present in both settlements like a real brand. Together with the verb “densifying”, the <b>recompositions</b> highlight an overall order which may be translated {{from one place to another}} into the words matching, tracing, renewing, spinning and sighting. In a complementary way together with densifying and ordering, urban empty spaces are examined, suggesting a synthesis between two of the more well known images of Collage City, St Dié, in Le Corbusier’s hypothesis, and the historical fabric of Parma. These two diametrically opposed alternatives, highlight the completion methods adopted for the two Palermo neighbourhoods through <b>recompositions.</b> These projects are not absolute frameworks of the portions of the town plans, but are offered as possible “alternatives to the town plan” remembering what Aldo Rossi said in the text accompanying the “analagous city”...|$|R

60|$|If the {{properties}} which are fittest {{to be selected}} as marks of other common properties are also obvious and familiar, and especially if they bear a great part in producing that general air of resemblance which was the original inducement {{to the formation of}} the class, the definition will then be most felicitous. But it is often necessary to define the class by some property not familiarly known, provided that property be the best mark of those which are known. M. De Blainville, for instance, founded his definition of life on the process of decomposition and <b>recomposition</b> which incessantly takes place in every living body, so that the particles composing it are never for two instants the same. This is by no means one of the most obvious properties of living bodies; it might escape altogether the notice of an unscientific observer. Yet great authorities (independently of M. De Blainville, who is himself a first-rate authority) have thought that no other property so well answers the conditions required for the definition.|$|E

In all of them the metallic compounds are brought {{into contact with the}} substances which compose the human or animal body; and the instances do not seem to agree in any other circumstance.

And what is the result which follows in all the cases? The conversion of the animal substance (by combination with the poison) into a chemical compound, held together by so powerful a force as to resist the subsequent action of the ordinary causes of decomposition. Now, organic life (the necessary condition of sensitive life) consisting in a continual state of decomposition and <b>recomposition</b> of the different organs and tissues, whatever incapacitates them for this decomposition destroys life.

They considered the negative current as collecting and carrying the acids, &c. to the positive pole, and the positive current as doing the same duty with the bases, and collecting them at the negative pole.

6000|$|While agreeing {{generally}} with Professor Huxley's remarks [...] respecting miracles, in [...] "The Agnostic Annual for 1892," [...] it [...] {{has seemed}} to me that one of his arguments at least requires [...] qualification.

6000|$|Plato's fame {{does not}} {{stand on a}} syllogism, or on any masterpieces of the Socratic, or on any thesis, as, for example, the {{immortality}} of the soul. He {{is more than an}} expert, or a school-man, or a geometer, or the prophet of a peculiar message. He represents the privilege of the intellect, the power, namely, of carrying up every fact to successive platforms, and so disclosing, in every fact, a germ of expansion. These expansions are in the essence of thought. The naturalist would never help us to them by any discoveries of the extent of the universe, but is as poor, when cataloguing the resolved nebula of Orion, as when measuring the angles of an acre. But the Republic of Plato, by these expansions, may be said to require, and so to anticipate, the astronomy of Laplace. The expansions are organic. The mind does not create what it perceives, any more than the eye creates the rose. In ascribing to Plato the merit of announcing them, we only say, here was a more complete man, who could apply to nature the whole scale of the senses, the understanding, and the reason. These expansions, or extensions, consist in continuing the spiritual sight where the horizon falls on our natural vision, and, by this second sight, discovering the long lines of law which shoot in every direction. Everywhere he stands on a path which has no end, but runs continuously round the universe. Therefore, every word becomes an exponent of nature. Whatever he looks upon discloses a second sense, and ulterior senses. His perception of the generation of contraries, of death out of life, and life out of death,--that law by which, in nature, decomposition is <b>recomposition,</b> and putrefaction and cholera are only signals of a new creation; his discernment of the little in the large, and the large in the small; studying the state in the citizen, and the citizen in the state; and leaving it doubtful whether he exhibited the Republic as an allegory on the education of the private soul; his beautiful definitions of ideas, of time, of form, of figure, of the line, sometimes hypothetically given, as his defining of virtue, courage, justice, temperance; his love of the apologue, and his apologues themselves; the cave of Trophonius; the ring of Gyges; the charioteer and two horses; the golden, silver, brass, and iron temperaments; Theuth and Thamus; and the visions of Hades and the Fates--fables which have imprinted themselves in the human memory like the signs of the zodiac; his soliform eye and his boniform soul; his doctrine of assimilation; his doctrine of reminiscence; his clear vision of the laws of return, or reaction, which secure instant justice throughout the universe, instanced everywhere, but specially in the doctrine, [...] "what comes from God to us, returns from us to God," [...] and in Socrates' belief that the laws below are sisters of the laws above.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to address the {{presence}} of seven recomposed ricercari by Jacques Buus in the Music Manuscript 242 from the Library of the University of Coimbra in Portugal (P-Cug MM 242). These <b>recompositions,</b> probably copied in the third quarter of the 16 th century, were made after the previously copied Buus´s ricercari in Music Manuscript 48 (P-Cug MM 48) of the same library, which were based on the Libro primo de ricercari a quattro voci, published in Venice in 1547 by Antonio Gardane. In this article, I intend to focus in two main aspects of the research done on this subject. 	The first topic concerns the score-format of both manuscripts 48 & 242, which testify the instrumental activity in mid-sixteenth century Portugal. I will demonstrate that this format served once, in the Santa Cruz Monastery in Coimbra, as a didactic tool in the teaching of counterpoint through the music of a northern European master such as Jacques Buus. The copies in the manuscripts were never intended to be used as a performing support – they contain many errors of vertical coordination between the voices that make the performance impossible. The second topic focuses on Buus´s recomposed ricercari, which were the object of many cuts, brief recomposed bridges, newly inserted sections, and written glosa figurations. Through these <b>recompositions,</b> I will describe the theoretic assimilation of formal processes, of style, mode, counterpoint and performing practice. 	The achievement of this article is to offer historic musicology researchers a new perspective about the enormous influence that Buus´s ricercari from his Libro primo… had in the learning processes of music composition and in the development of didactic and performing practices in the Santa Cruz Monastery in Coimbra, during the mid-sixteenth century decades...|$|R
