40|$|Abstract Objective To {{study the}} effects of <b>reduced</b> <b>lighting</b> on the gait of older adults with a high level gait {{disorder}} (HLGD) and to compare their response to that of healthy elderly controls. Methods 22 patients with a HLGD and 20 age-matched healthy controls were studied under usual lighting conditions (1000 lumens) and in near darkness (5 lumens). Gait speed and gait dynamics were measured under both conditions. Cognitive function, co-morbidities, depressive symptoms, and vision were also evaluated. Results Under usual lighting conditions, patients walked more slowly, with reduced swing times, and increased stride-to-stride variability, compared to controls. When walking under near darkness conditions, both groups slowed their gait. All other measures of gait were not affected by lighting in the controls. In contrast, patients further reduced their swing times and increased their stride-to-stride variability, both stride time variability and swing time variability. The unique response of the patients was not explained by vision, mental status, co-morbidities, or the values of walking under usual lighting conditions. Conclusion Walking with <b>reduced</b> <b>lighting</b> does not affect the gait of healthy elderly subjects, except for a reduction in speed. On the other hand, the gait of older adults with a HLGD becomes more variable and unsteady when they walk in near darkness, despite adapting a slow and cautious gait. Further work is needed to identify the causes of the maladaptive response among patients with a HLGD and the potential connection between this behavior and the increased fall risk observed in these patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|Behavioural models {{derived from}} {{on-going}} field studies {{can provide the}} basis for predicting personal action taken to adjust lighting levels, remedy direct glare, and save energy in response to physical conditions. Enabling these behavioural models in advanced lighting simulation programs, such as DAYSIM and the Lightswitch Wizard, allows for a more realistic estimate of lighting use under dynamic conditions. The current downside of these approaches is that the whole building energy impact of manual changes in blind settings and lighting use, including its effect on heating and cooling requirements, is not considered. A sub-hourly occupancy-based control model (SHOCC), which enables advanced behavioural models within whole building energy simulation, is presented. The considered behavioural models are the Lightswitch 2002 algorithms for manual and automated light and blind control, while the investigated whole building energy simulation program is ESP-r. The enhanced functionality is demonstrated through annual energy simulations aiming at quantifying the total energy impact of manual control over lights and window blinds. Results show that building occupants that actively seek daylighting rather than systematically relying on artificial lighting can reduce overall primary energy expenditure by more than 40 %, when compared to occupants who rely on constant artificial lighting. This underlines the importance of defining suitable reference cases for benchmarking the performance of automated lighting controls. Results also show that, depending on the proportion of buildings occupants that actively seek out daylighting, <b>reduced</b> <b>lighting</b> use through automated control may not always produce anticipated savings in primary energy for indoor climate control. In some cases, <b>reduced</b> <b>lighting</b> use is shown to even increase primary energy expenditure for indoor climate control, trimming down initial primary energy savings in lighting alone.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined to}} what extent physical factors, notably lighting and entrapment (blocked escape), and individual factors, notably gender, affect feelings of safety and the acceptability of <b>reduced</b> <b>lighting</b> levels. The authors reasoned that acceptability of reduced street lighting depends on perceived safety, which in turn depends on entrapment, lighting, and gender. Virtual representations of a residential street were used, systematically manipulating entrapment and lighting levels. As expected, people felt less safe in lower lighting and higher entrapment settings, and these settings were evaluated as less acceptable. Although women perceived a situation as less safe compared with men, the authors found no gender differences in acceptability, which extends previous research. Importantly, as hypothesized, perceived safety mediated the effect of lighting on acceptability levels, suggesting that people can accept lower lighting levels when social safety is not threatened...|$|E

40|$|Lightin {{is a major}} {{electricity}} end use. In {{both the}} residential and the commercial sector, lighting represents {{a large share of}} the consumption and adds substantially to national paek loads. In this issue of the CADDET Energy Efficiency Newsletter, special attention is paid to various aspects of commercial lighting. This is important. Often, lightin is a natural first target for energy saving strategies in commercial buildings: reducing the lighting load is often the most cost-effective option, and lighting programmes can yield results faster than programmes focusing on other technology areas. Moreover, lighting is also particularly interesting from a systems perspective. <b>Reduced</b> <b>lighting</b> loads will often lead to substantial reductions in ventilation and cooling energy consumption. Even in nohtern parts of a cold country like Sweden, modern office buildings have to be cooled during large parts of the winter season.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{relationship}} of glucocorticoid secretion to light-induced, early-winter priming of pelage in ranch mink was investigated. Sixteen Standard Dark, mature, female mink {{were exposed to}} natural light conditions of 45 ° North latitude beginning on December 13, 1977. A 2 x 4 cm area of the right hip of each animal was sheared permitting measurement of changes in fur growth. At biweekly intervals blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture and the length and width of the vulva measured. On June 26, 1978 the remaining animals were assigned at random to two groups and an additional five animals were placed in each group (total, eight animals per group). Group I animals were housed in a light-control facility and subjected to 6 hours of artificial light daily from June 26 to November 27, 1978. Group 11 animals served as controls and were exposed to natural light conditions. Blood samples, fur and vulva measurements continued to be collected biweekly. Serum concentrations of total glucocorticoids were determined by competitive protein binding. Changes in the pelage of mink reared under natural light conditions were typical. The pelage of mink reared under <b>reduced</b> <b>lighting</b> was fully prime by October 30, {{as compared with the}} pelage of control animals which was prime by November 27 (time x light regime interaction, P<. 01). A significant seasonal effect (P<. 01) on serum total glucocorticoid levels in control mink revealed a pattern of three peaks over the 12 -month period. The pattern of glucocorticoid secretion was not affected by exposure of mink to <b>reduced</b> <b>lighting.</b> Maximal concentrations of serum total glucocorticoids occurred on the same date (September 5) in both groups although levels were greater in the light-treated (44. 5 + 10. 4 ng/ml) than in the control mink (26. 9 + 5. 7 ng/ml). Fur growth was found to be positively correlated with serum total glucocorticoid concentrations in both light-treated and control animals during the period from June 26 to December 21, 1978 (overall r =. 14, P<. 05). Both the length and width of the vulva increased (P<. 01) between February 21 and March 20 in animals reared under natural lighting. No changes were observed {{in the size of the}} vulva in control or light-treated mink during the remainder of the year. These data suggest that some light-induced factor acts alone or in concert with glucocorticoids to promote pelage changes in the mink...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This {{technical}} note provides {{recommendations for the}} design and construction of dock and terminal platform structures to minimize impacts to seagrasses, and describes the con-struction of two experimental platforms in St. Andrew Bay, FL. BACKGROUND: Seagrasses are widely {{recognized as one of}} the most productive and valuable habitats in the shallow marine environment. Although the area of seagrass loss associated with any individual dock is relatively small, cumulative impacts and fragmentation of seagrass beds may be significant along highly developed shorelines. With seagrass populations in decline in many areas, coastal resource managers are interested in the development of consistent, defensi-ble guidelines to reduce additional dock-associated impacts to an already stressed resource. The amount of available light is one of the most important factors affecting the survival, growth, and depth distribution of seagrasses. Although seagrass response to <b>reduced</b> <b>lighting</b> has been well-documented (Bulthuis 1983, Czerny and Dunton 1995, and others), experimental studies alone do not provide a basis for the development of guidelines to reduce dock shading impacts. Until recently, quantitative data to support the development of regulatory guidelines concerning the placement of docks over seagrass beds have been lacking (Loflin 1995, Burdick and Shor...|$|E
