The topological plane has a concept of a linear path, but no concept of a straight line. The topological plane, or its equivalent the open disc, is the basic topological neighborhood used to construct surfaces (or 2-manifolds) classified in low-dimensional topology. Isomorphisms of the topological plane are all continuous bijections. The topological plane is the natural context for the branch of graph theory that deals with planar graphs, and results such as the four color theorem.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the characteristics of a soft sensor that has the sense of human skin. The sensor is composed of two rectangular <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> and a strain gauge inserted between the interface of the two sheets. The sensor is an application of Poisson's effect, which is a peculiar characteristic of the elastic medium. The normal force applied {{to the surface of the}} sensor contracts the <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> in the normal direction. At the same time, the force expands the medium in the horizontal direction, which results in a horizontal strain proportional to the normal force applied. Thus, the magnitude of the applied force can be determined by measuring the output of the strain gauge that is placed horizontally between the <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets.</b> Characteristics of the sensor are measured for various combination of the two <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> with different hardness and thickness. It is shown that the soft sensor proposed is effective for measurement of both concentrated and distributed applied loads. Further more, it is found that the hysteretic loop of the stress-strain curve is reduced and the linearity of the sensor is improved by placing copper foil between the two <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} if the multistable behaviour of {{corrugated plastic}} sheets under low tensile strain is a purely elastic phenomenon, tensile strain experiments {{were performed on}} thin silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> with corrugations. To perform such experiments, thin silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> with and without corrugations were cast by using a voltage controlled spin-coater. For the characterization of the sheets, a micrometer {{was used to measure}} the thickness in order to obtain values for the average thickness and homogeneity of the sheets. A protocol for tensilse tests on smooth thin silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> by using an Instron tensile test machine was formulated to obtain a value for the Young’s Modulus of the used silicone rubber experimentally. A series of low tensile strain experiments was carried out on a set of thin silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> with different kinds of corrugation patterns, after which the behaviour of these sheets was compared to the behaviour of corrugated plastic sheets under the same tensile strain...|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} leakage {{isolation}} sheet with self-repairing mechanism is presented, {{in which there}} is no water leakage when the sheet is broken. The sheet consists of two <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> with lattices inside. Polymer particles are in the lattices, and sandwiched between the <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets.</b> The polymer particles expand in contact with water, and they become gel. The large pressure is generated in the lattice of the sheet. Hence, the sheets isolate water leakage. When the rubber is broken, polymer particles fall down with water. In order to keep the particles in the lattice of the sheet, textile sheets lie on the back surfaces of the <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets.</b> Experimental tests have carried out for a model of the sheet, and it is clarified that the proposed sheet isolates leakage perfectly under 1 MPa pressure when the sheet is broken by, 10 mm diameter punch...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{migration}} kinetics {{of chemical}} additives in vulcanized natural rubber compounds were studied as function of ingredient loading. <b>Rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> were compounded {{according to a}} 212 - 8 fractional factorial design of experiment, where ingredients were treated as factors varied at two levels of loading. Amount of migrated additives in surface of <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> was monitored through time at ambient conditions. The maximum amount and estimated rate of additive migration were determined from weight loss kinetic curves. Attenuated total reflection–Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and optical microscopy were used to characterize the chemical structure and surface morphology of sheet specimens during additive migration. ANOVA results showed that increased loading of reclaimed rubber, CaCO 3, and paraffin wax signif icantly decreased {{the maximum amount of}} additive migration; by contrast, increased loading of used oil, asphalt, and mercaptobenzothiazole disulphide (MBTS) increased the maximum amount. Increased loading of sulfur, diphenylguanidine (DPG), and paraffin wax significantly decreased the additive migration rate; increased loading of used oil, asphalt, and stearic acid elicited an opposite effect. Comparison of ATRFTIR spectra of migrated and cleaned rubber surfaces showed signif icant variation in intensity of specif ic absorbance bands that are also present in infrared spectra of migrating chemicals. Paraffin wax, used oil, stearic acid, MBTS, asphalt, and zinc stearate were identified to bloom and bleed in the <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets.</b> Optical micrographs of migrated rubber surfaces revealed formation of white precipitates due to blooming and of semi-transparent wet patches due to bleeding. ...|$|R
50|$|Consider an {{idealized}} <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet</b> suspended {{in a uniform}} gravitational field normal to the sheet. In equilibrium, the elastic tension in {{each part of the}} sheet must be equal and opposite to the gravitational pull on that part of the sheet; that is,where k is the elastic constant of the rubber, h(x) is the upward displacement of the sheet (assumed to be small), g is the strength of the gravitational field, and ρ(x) is the mass density of the sheet. The mass density may be viewed as intrinsic to the sheet or as belonging to objects resting on top of the sheet.This equilibrium condition is identical in form to the gravitational Poisson equationwhere Φ(x) is the gravitational potential and ρ(x) is the mass density. Thus, to a first approximation, a massive object placed on a <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet</b> will deform the sheet into a correctly shaped gravity well, and (as in the rigid case) a second test object placed near the first will gravitate toward it in an approximation of the correct force law.|$|E
