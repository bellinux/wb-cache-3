2500|$|Charles, Prince of Wales {{was invited}} {{to speak to the}} European Parliament on 14 February 2008; in his speech he called for EU {{leadership}} in the battle against climate change. During the standing ovation that followed, Farage was the only MEP to remain seated, and he went on to describe the Prince's advisers as [...] "naïve and foolish at best." [...] Farage continued: [...] "How can somebody like Prince Charles be allowed to come to the European Parliament at this time to announce he thinks it should have more powers? It would have been better for the country he wants to rule one day if he had stayed home and tried to persuade Gordon Brown to give the people the promised referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon." [...] The leader of the UK Labour Party's MEPs, Gary Titley, accused Farage of anti-Royalism. Titley said: [...] "I was embarrassed and disgusted when the Leader of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, remained firmly seated during the lengthy standing ovation Prince Charles <b>received.</b> <b>I</b> had not realised Mr Farage's blind adherence to right-wing politics involved disloyalty and discourtesy to the Royal Family.

2500|$|.....by far {{the most}} Radical measure of my lifetime. I do not object to the {{principle}} of graduated taxation: for the just principle of ability to pay is not determined simply by the amount of income.... But, so far as I understand the present measure of finance from the partial reports I have <b>received,</b> <b>I</b> find it too violent. It involves a great departure from the methods of political action established in this country, where reforms, and especially financial reforms, have always been considerate and even tender.... I do not yet see the ground on which it can be justly held that any one description of property should be more heavily burdened than others, unless moral and social grounds can be shown first: but in this case the reasons drawn from those sources seem rather to verge in the opposite direction, for real property has more of presumptive connection with the discharge of duty that that which is ranked as personal...the aspect of the measure is not satisfactory to a man of my traditions (and these traditions lie near the roots of my being).... For the sudden introduction of such change there is I think no precedent {{in the history of this}} country. And the severity of the blow is greatly aggravated in moral effect by the fact that it is dealt only to a handful of individuals.|$|E
