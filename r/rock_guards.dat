5000|$|Mebetoys {{models were}} known for {{well-done}} castings (Rixon 2005, p. 80). Some were very clever model selections {{such as the}} Autobianchi A66 Elaf petroleum with a roof luggage rack carrying two large plastic oil barrels, or the Porsche 912 Rally (a 911 in rally form) with <b>rock</b> <b>guards</b> in thin yellow plastic strips covering the front windshield and hood and also featuring red and chrome body and bumper supports which extended from front to rear bumper. This car, in 1:43 scale, was topped off, literally, with three spare tires on the roof. Mebetoys Innocenti Mini (Italian-made mini) appeared in several different guises - including with skis and sled on its roof rack. Other models were unique {{because they were not}} offered elsewhere, like the ISO Fidia S4 grand touring sedan. Politoys had the Rivolta and Corgi and Matchbox made the Grifo ubiquitous, but nobody else made the Fidia S4. Models such as the Lamborghini Urraco, Maserati Bora, Toyota 2000 GT, and Ferrari 365 GTC-4 were also special and not often seen in 1:43 scale. Corgi Toys made the Bora, but the Mebetoys version was much better proportioned, detailed and painted (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p. 74). Sinclair's Auto Miniatures, largely responsible for bringing the diecast collector hobby to the United States, discussed that many people were not aware that Mebetoys also made a few promotional issue diecast cars (Sinclair's 1977; Levine 2009). In the 1960s the company issued a couple of 1:24 scale Alfa Romeos, referred to as the [...] "le veterane" [...] set. These two cars were a 1925 P2 World Champion Grand Prix car and a 1951 Alfetta racer. They had exquisite detail with rubber tires and were mounted on a wood base with a decorative identification plate and covered with a clear plastic display box. These were reissued in the late 1970s (Sinclair's 1977).|$|E

5000|$|Until four stones {{have been}} played (two from each side), stones {{in the free}} guard zone (those stones left in the area between the hog and tee lines, {{excluding}} the house) may not be removed by an opponent's stone (although they can be moved {{as long as they}} are not taken out of play). These are known as <b>guard</b> <b>rocks.</b> If the <b>guard</b> <b>rocks</b> are removed, they are placed back in the positions they were before the shot was thrown, and the opponent's stone is removed from play and cannot be replayed.

5000|$|Duart Castle on the Isle of Mull is the {{historic}} {{seat of the}} chiefs of the Clan Maclean. The castle is perched on a <b>rock</b> <b>guarding</b> the Sound of Mull. Dating from the thirteenth century it consists of a strong curtain wall {{as well as a}} substantial tower or keep that was added in about 1390. There are also later ranges that were built within the courtyard. Duart Castle was abandoned after the Jacobite rising of 1745 and it then became derelict and roofless. However, in 1911 it was acquired by Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 10th Baronet, chief of Clan Maclean who restored it. The castle is still owned by the Macleans of Duart although they now live in Perthshire. The castle {{is open to the public}} in the summer. The exterior of Duart Castle was used in the film [...] "Entrapment" [...] with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery, whose mother, Euphemia McBain [...] "Effie" [...] - [...] née McLean - [...] was a Maclean.|$|R
6000|$|The idea of Providence {{was very}} gaily travested by Daudet in [...] "Tartarin in the Alps."

If the mountaineer tried to get into real danger he was turned back by specious excuses. Inspired by this persuasion Tartarin behaved with incredible daring. [...] .
