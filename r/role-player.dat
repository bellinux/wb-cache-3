25|$|The biggest {{move that}} Layden {{made during the}} 2002-03 season was {{completed}} on draft night. After selecting Nenê with the 7th pick in the 2002 NBA draft, he was immediately traded along with Marcus Camby and Mark Jackson to the Denver Nuggets in return for power forward Antonio McDyess, the draft rights to guard Frank Williams and a 2003 second-round draft pick. McDyess, a former #2 draft pick, was already limited to <b>role-player</b> status due to chronic injury; He played only 18 games for the Knicks. Williams was a disappointment from the beginning, his Knick career lasted 65 games with only three starts. On {{the other end of}} this transaction, Denver received a solid NBA player in power forward/center Marcus Camby. Camby had averaged a double-double (at least 10 rebounds and 10 points per-game) over his last two seasons as a Knick and nearly 2 blocked shots, along with being an integral part of New York's eastern conference title in 1999.|$|E

5000|$|Field medical {{training}}, or Tactical Combat Casualty Care training utilizes <b>role-players</b> {{to portray}} wounded soldiers and civilians on the battlefield. <b>Role-players</b> will often scream in pain, convulse, and panic to create extreme emotional {{conditions under which}} battle medics must operate proficiently.

500|$|Having {{been hired}} by Beam's parent company Melbourne House, fantasy and sci-fi writer Paul Kidd quickly took Barnett's place as lead designer. According to Kidd, the given {{timeframe}} for finishing Shadowrun for publisher Data East was very short, forcing the team to complete production in a tumultuous {{five and a half}} to six months. An avid <b>role-player,</b> Kidd was already familiar with the Shadowrun license, but had to utilize the storyline that his predecessor had already gotten approved. Aspects of Beam's earlier action-adventure game Nightshade, of which Kidd was the writer, director and lead designer, were used as a basis for Shadowrun; specific film noir components such as [...] "dark cityscapes, dialogue-heavy exchanges, and touches of humor" [...] were adapted directly from the former to the latter. To coincide with the last of these qualities, Kidd and programmer Jeff Kamenek altered the original [...] "serious" [...] tone of Shadowrun by replacing portions of the script and artwork with more comedic elements. According to Kidd, [...] "we made improvements and changes, but the basic concepts were pretty much the same [...]" ...|$|E

50|$|Role-players {{are used}} by {{businesses}} to equip their leadership with experience in handling interpersonal conflict, negotiations, interviews, performance reviews, customer service, workplace safety, and ethical dilemmas.

50|$|Howard Barrows {{invented the}} model for medical patient {{role-playing}} in 1963 at University of Southern California. This program allowed doctors practice taking medical histories and conducting physical examinations by participating in a one-on-one scenario with a <b>role-player.</b> The role-players (called Standardized Patients or SP) were also trained on providing performance evaluations after the fiction of the scenario was complete. Barrows continued to evolve this model, eventually bringing it to other physicians in the 1970s, and into the academic world in the 1980s. Today, many hospitals and medical universities have their own standardized patient programs that employ part-time role-players trained to specific standards of interaction. The Association of Standardized Patient Educators has members from six different continents.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{information}} on the factors that affect the marketing of cowpeas in Senegal, this study investigates key aspects for the successful marketing of cowpeas in Senegal. The contribution this study makes lies in the information it generates to empower <b>role-players</b> in the cowpea value chain to better understand (i) the demand relations of cowpeas in Senegal, (ii) the information needs of <b>role-players</b> {{and the extent to which}} markets are integrated, and (iii) for which characteristics of cowpea consumers are willing to pay premiums. An Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) model is applied to one period cross sectional data to estimate demand relations of cowpea's in Senegal. The own price elasticity of cowpea is - 1. 23 while its expenditure elasticity is 0. 97 showing that cowpea is a normal necessity. A sample of 443 respondents was taken to determine the information needs of different <b>role-players</b> in the cowpea supply chain. Availability of price information on local and export markets are deemed vitally important by all role players. Information pertaining to quantities supplied and demanded, and buyers' preferences are not regarded by all <b>role-players</b> as equally important. The most appropriate mode to dissemination cowpea related information should depend on the accessibility of a particular mode by <b>role-players.</b> Bivariate correlation coefficients, co-integration tests, Granger Causality tests and Ravallion's model are used to investigate level of market integration. The results show that cowpea markets as a whole are not integrated. This is not a surprising result since it can be linked to the general lack of market information. The influence of cowpea characteristics on cowpea prices is analyzed with a hedonic pricing model. The results show that large grain size and sugar contents are characteristics for which consumers are willing to pay premiums in all markets. The implication of the results of this study has several dimensions, i. e. (i) <b>role-players</b> in the cowpea supply chain now has information to guide pricing strategies, (ii) changes in expenditures on cowpeas can be properly discounted in marketing strategies, (iii) interventions can be designed to address the needs of information users and to address the non-integrated nature of cowpeas markets, and (iv) research programs and <b>role-players</b> should focus their research and marketing activities on those characteristics for which consumers are willing to pay premiums.
