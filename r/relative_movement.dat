5|$|While the BTO {{is able to}} {{determine}} {{the distance between the}} satellite and the aircraft at the time of each handshake, it was still necessary {{to determine}} where along the BTO arcs the aircraft was. To accomplish this, an analysis was performed on another attribute of received signals that was recorded by the ground station: the burst frequency offset (BFO)—the difference between the expected and actual frequencies of the signal received from the aircraft. The BFO is primarily caused by the Doppler shift—a shift in frequency caused by the <b>relative</b> <b>movement</b> of the aircraft, satellite, and ground station—along with several other factors which can be calculated and removed, allowing the Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite to be isolated. The Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite indicates the relative motion of the aircraft relative to the satellite, although multiple combinations of aircraft speed and heading exist that match a given Doppler shift value.|$|E

50|$|The N64 {{analog stick}} uses {{a pair of}} optical {{encoding}} disks to determine its position. This {{is very similar to}} how ball mice work. Since optical encoding disks only give the system relative changes in the position of the analog stick, the system assumes that the stick is centered during power-on and tracks <b>relative</b> <b>movements</b> from there. If things get out of sync, or if the control stick was not centered during power-on, the center position can be reset by pressing the left and right shoulder buttons (L and R) {{at the same time as}} the Start button. The system then assumes the joystick is centered and continues to track <b>relative</b> <b>movements</b> from there. While the optical encoding disks are mostly digital and provide very accurate <b>relative</b> <b>movements,</b> third party controllers and joysticks often use cheaper potentiometers instead. These allow the controller to track the absolute position of the joystick, but since the signal is analog, it's very noisy and can fluctuate even if the joystick isn't moved.|$|R

Small business woodworkers who work in a store-front sometimes use various species so that their clients can see examples of the different woods in a finished state.

25|$|The lithosphere, {{which is}} the rigid {{outermost}} shell of a planet (the crust and upper mantle), is broken into tectonic plates. The Earth's lithosphere is composed of seven or eight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates. Where the plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary: convergent, divergent, or transform. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries (or faults). The <b>relative</b> <b>movement</b> of the plates typically ranges from zero to 100mm annually.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} of {{components of a}} mechanical system are analyzed by attaching a reference frame to each part and determining how the various reference frames move relative to each other. If the structural stiffness of the parts are sufficient, then their deformation can be neglected and rigid transformations {{can be used to}} define this <b>relative</b> <b>movement.</b> This reduces the description of the motion of the various parts of a complicated mechanical system to a problem of describing the geometry of each part and geometric association of each part relative to other parts.|$|E

Chromosome {{segregation}} in most animal cells is brought about through two events: {{the movement of}} the chromosomes to the poles (anaphase A) and {{the movement of the}} poles away from each other (anaphase B).

Through use of tubulin derivatized with X-rhodamine, photobleaching, and digital imaging microscopy of living cells, we directly determined the <b>relative</b> <b>movements</b> of poles, chromosomes, and a marked domain on kinetochore fibers during anaphase. During chromosome movement and pole-pole separation, the marked domain did not move significantl...|$|R
25|$|The EMF {{generated}} by Faraday's law of induction due to <b>relative</b> <b>movement</b> of a circuit and {{a magnetic field}} is the phenomenon underlying electrical generators. When a permanent magnet is moved relative to a conductor, or vice versa, an electromotive force is created. If the wire is connected through an electrical load, current will flow, and thus electrical energy is generated, converting the mechanical energy of motion to electrical energy. For example, the drum generator {{is based upon the}} figure to the right. A different implementation of this idea is the Faraday's disc, shown in simplified form on the right.|$|E
25|$|A {{technique}} to eliminate mechanical scanning of the grating and still retain the maximum spatial resolution is electronic phase stepping. It scans the source spot of the x-ray tube with an electro-magnetic field. This causes {{the projection of}} the object {{to move in the}} opposite direction, and also causes a <b>relative</b> <b>movement</b> between the projection and the Moiré fringes. The images are digitally shifted to realign the projections. The end result is that the projection of the object is stationary, while the Moiré fringes move over it. This technique effectively synthesizes the phase stepping process, but without the costs and delays associated with mechanical movements.|$|E
25|$|The Reynolds {{number is}} {{the ratio of}} {{inertial}} forces to viscous forces within a fluid which is subjected to relative internal movement due to different fluid velocities, in {{what is known as}} a boundary layer {{in the case of a}} bounding surface such as the interior of a pipe. A similar effect is created by the introduction of a stream of higher velocity fluid, such as the hot gases from a flame in air. This <b>relative</b> <b>movement</b> generates fluid friction, which is a factor in developing turbulent flow. Counteracting this effect is the viscosity of the fluid, which as it increases, progressively inhibits turbulence, as more kinetic energy is absorbed by a more viscous fluid. The Reynolds number quantifies the relative importance of these two types of forces for given flow conditions, and is a guide to when turbulent flow will occur in a particular situation.|$|E

Among the states where the candidates finished at a margin of within 7 percent, Clinton won Virginia (13 electoral votes), Colorado (9), Maine (2), Minnesota (10), and New Hampshire (4). On the other hand, Trump won Michigan (16), Pennsylvania (20), Wisconsin (10), Florida (29), North Carolina (15), Arizona (11), Nebraska's second district (1), and Georgia (16). States won by Obama in the 2012 contest, such as Ohio (18), Iowa (6), and Maine's second district (1), were also won by Trump. The close result in Maine was not expected by most commentators, nor were Trump's victory of over 10 {{points in the second}} district and their disparities. The dramatic shift of Midwestern states towards Trump were contrasted in the media against the <b>relative</b> <b>movement</b> of Southern states towards the Democrats. For example, former Democratic strongholds such as Minnesota leaned towards the GOP and Iowa voted more Republican than Texas did, while Arizona and Georgia were more Democratic than Ohio. Trump's smaller victories in Alaska and Utah, also took some experts by surprise.|$|E
500|$|Mantises, like stick insects, show rocking {{behavior}} {{in which the}} insect makes rhythmic, repetitive side-to-side movements. Functions proposed for this {{behavior in}}clude the enhancement of crypsis {{by means of the}} resemblance to vegetation moving in the wind. However, the repetitive swaying movements may be most important in allowing the insects to discriminate objects from the background by their <b>relative</b> <b>movement,</b> a visual mechanism typical of animals with simpler sight systems. Rocking movements by these generally sedentary insects may replace flying or running as a source of relative motion of objects in the visual field. As ants may be predators of mantises, genera such as [...] Loxomantis, Orthodera, and Statilia, like many other arthropods, avoid attacking them. Exploiting this behavior, a variety of arthropods, including some early-instar mantises, mimic ants to evade their predators.|$|E
