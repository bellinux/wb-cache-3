In this study, short glass fibre (GF) <b>reinforced</b> <b>polypropylenes</b> (PPs) with improved hygrothermal durability were obtained by incorporating NaBF 4 into the sizing and thus the interphases of GF/PP composites.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{commercial}} available polypropylene compounds, there exists an increasing demand for light construction materials. These new materials have to be usable for existing mechanical equipments. The filling materials and reinforcement materials must have a low abrasive action. According to these requirements, weight relative stiffness and stability and processing properties gain in importance. These aspects enable increasing market prospects with respect to materials such as PEN fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>polypropylene</b> composites in order to substitute the established classical glass fibre compounds. The author investigates the scientifical, technological and process technical possibilities of the production of low weight and nonabrasive polypropylene compounds. Poly(ethylene naphthalate) fibres and poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibres are used for the modification of polypropylene. In this research project, the main themes are the incorporation of PEN fibres into polypropylene amounts and the elaboration of material specific and process technological parameters {{with respect to the}} use of synthetic fibres as nonabrasive low weight filling material. New synthetic fibre modified polypropylene compounds are developed by means of extrusion according to applications in the area of injection moulding. In comparison to commercial mineral <b>reinforced</b> <b>polypropylene</b> compounds, PEN or PET reinforced compounds have a low density and a low abrasion. The incorporation of synthetic fibres into polypropylene upgrade the properties of plastic composites, especially in rigidity and impact strength at low densities.

40|$|This {{research}} {{studied the}} degradation of tensile properties of kenaf fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>polypropylene</b> composites due to cyclic immersion into two different solutions, as well as comparison of the developed composites’ tensile properties under continuous and cyclic immersion. Composites with 40 % and 60 % fibre loadings were immersed in tap water and bleach for 4 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 3 days of immersion and 4 days of conditioning in room temperature (28 °C and 55 % humidity). The tensile strength and modulus of composites were affected by fibre composition, type of liquid of immersion, and number of cycles.

In order to investigate {{one of the most common}} natural fibers, wheat fibers, as a reinforcing material, 156 mortar specimens and 99 concrete specimens were tested.

The thermal behaviour is of practical interest for conditions associated with temperatures above the atmospheric, as in fire damage, curing or process involving heating procedures. The sound absorption coefficient for a material is the fraction or percentage of incident sound energy that is absorbed by the material. The function of absorptive materials is to transform impinging acoustic energy into heat. The thermal stability of the composites {{was found to be}} higher than that of rice straw, kenaf fibers and the polypropylene matrix. The sound absorption coefficients of composites increased as the frequency increased. However, they decreased at the frequency of 1000 Hz and increased again. This decrease and increase was due to the specific characteristic of Lignocellulosic fibers reflecting sound at 1300 Hz but absorbing sound in the middle and high frequency ranges...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePolymer electrolytes, using Poly(epichlorhydrin) as matrix, {{have been}} {{prepared}} and characterized. Anion conducting networks have been obtained by the incorporation of cyclic diamine named 1, 4 Diazabicyclo [2. 2. 2] octane (DABCO), not very sensitive to Hoffman elimination. In order to improve the mechanical properties, the membranes were <b>reinforced</b> by <b>poly(propylene)</b> or nylon supports. The physicochemical and electrochemical characterizations: exchange ionic capacity, swelling ratio, glass transition temperature, ionic conductivity, ageing stability, were evaluated. The performances of these membranes such as solid polymer electrolytes in AFC (alkaline fuel cells) were proved...|$|R
