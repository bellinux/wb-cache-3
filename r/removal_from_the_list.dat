500|$|With {{each new}} publication, species are both added and {{removed from the}} list. [...] In some cases, <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> signifies {{improvement}} for the species. [...] With {{the publication of the}} 2006–2008 list, four species were removed because of increased conservation efforts: the black lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysopygus), golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia), mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei), and Perrier's sifaka (Propithecus perrieri). [...] In 2008, the black lion tamarin went from critically endangered to endangered and the golden lion tamarin was similarly promoted in 2003 after three decades of collaborative conservation efforts by zoos and other institutions. [...] Well-protected species such as these still have very small populations, and due to deforestation, new habitat is still needed for their long-term survival. [...] The Hainan black crested gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), which was removed from the 2008–2010 list, still has fewer than 20 individuals left, but significant efforts to protect it are now being made. [...] Mittermeier claimed in 2007 that all 25 species could be elevated off the list within five to ten years if conservation organizations had the necessary resources.|$|E
500|$|May 3 was {{declared}} a Polish holiday (Constitution DayŚwięto Konstytucji 3 Maja) on May 5, 1791. The holiday was banned during the partitions of Poland but reinstated in April 1919 under the Second Polish Republicthe first holiday officially {{introduced in the}} newly independent country. It was again outlawed during World War II by both the Nazi and Soviet occupiers. It was celebrated in Polish cities in May 1945, although in a mostly spontaneous manner. The 1946 anti-communist demonstrations did not endear it to the Polish communists, and it competed for attention with the communist-endorsed May 1 Labor Day celebrations in the Polish People's Republic; this led to its [...] "rebranding" [...] as Democratic Party Day and <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of national holidays by 1951. Until 1989, May 3 was a frequent occasion for anti-government and anti-communist protests. May 3 was restored as an official Polish holiday in April 1990 {{after the fall of}} communism. In 2007, May 3 {{was declared}} a Lithuanian national holiday. Polish-American pride has been celebrated on the same date, for instance in Chicago, where since 1982 Poles have marked it with festivities and the annual Polish Constitution Day Parade.|$|E

5000|$|On the 1970s top 10 <b>list,</b> perhaps <b>the</b> {{most notable}} is the 2nd {{appearance}} of James Earl Ray, in 1977. Additionally, in 1971 <b>the</b> <b>list</b> was completely filled with long-time fugitives, who persistently evaded capture, {{leading to the}} very first {{year in which the}} FBI found it impractical to add any new fugitives to <b>the</b> top ten <b>list.</b> In 1970, <b>the</b> FBI had packed <b>the</b> <b>list</b> with an extraordinary number of [...] "Special Additions" [...] of whom most evaded capture. Consequently, <b>the</b> 1971 <b>list</b> opened with a total of sixteen wanted fugitives at large, nearly twice as many as would typically appear on <b>the</b> <b>list</b> at any other given time. By {{the end of the year}} 1971, three of <b>the</b> <b>listed</b> wanted fugitives had been captured, bringing <b>the</b> opening 1972 <b>list</b> down to a still extraordinarily large number of thirteen fugitives. Due to further <b>removals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> in 1972, <b>the</b> FBI found justification to finally list a single new Fugitive late that year.|$|R
