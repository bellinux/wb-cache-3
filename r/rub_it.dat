5|$|Narrow/closed angle {{glaucoma}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} inheritable trait in the breed. It {{is a leading}} cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the eye. If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough, or slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle glaucoma. Symptoms can include redness in the eye, the eye itself looking cloudy, sensitivity to light and the dog may rub at their eye, or even <b>rub</b> <b>it</b> along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful. Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited glaucoma appears in one eye then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually.|$|E
25|$|North American brown bears (Ursos arctos) make a paste of Osha roots (Ligusticum porteri) and saliva and <b>rub</b> <b>it</b> {{through their}} fur to repel insects or soothe bites. This plant, locally known as bear root, {{contains}} 105 active compounds, such as coumarins that may repel insects when topically applied. Navajo Indians {{are said to}} have learned to use this root medicinally from the bear for treating stomach aches and infections.|$|E
500|$|After some time, Jenner {{joined the}} Royal Navy, but deserted in New York City, United States. He soon joined the United States Navy. Jenner's {{daughter}} stated {{in an interview}} after his death that {{he learned how to}} gamble during this time and he soon developed the impulse control disorder of problem gambling. He became particularly attached to the game craps, which was popular in the United States at the time. He started to keep a rabbit's foot in the left upper pocket of his shirt, and would <b>rub</b> <b>it</b> with his left hand while he rolled the dice with his right. His shipmates therefore began calling him [...] "Bones", a nickname that he retained {{for the rest of his}} navy career.|$|E

500|$|Eddy {{allowed her}} {{students}} to make copies of the manuscripts, but they were forbidden, under a $3,000 bond, from showing them to anyone. The students agreed to pay Eddy 10 percent annually of income derived from her work, and $1,000 if they failed to practice or teach it. She at first taught them to rub patients' heads, to [...] "lay [...] hands where the belief is to <b>rub</b> <b>it</b> out forever"; Kennedy would manipulate each student's head and solar plexus before class in preparation. The head rubbing was abandoned when the women complained about having to take their hair down, and the stomach rubbing held no appeal for them either. Eventually Eddy told them to ignore {{that part of the}} manuscript, and from then on Christian Science healing did not involve touching patients.|$|E
500|$|Years {{after its}} initial release, Streisand took to Larry King Live in 1991 and {{announced}} her displeasure with ButterFly and {{the songs on}} it. Biographer Tom Santopietro wrote that [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] and album track [...] "Grandma's Hands" [...] were among the bag songs on the album. He also stated that [...] "Broadway divas do not take naturally to singing 'Ooh baby, here I am. Come <b>rub</b> <b>it</b> on my belly like guava jelly'". In agreement, writer Shaun Considine claimed that one unknown critic in particular panned the track, stating [...] "Streisand was not born to sing reggae", while another joked that he/she had [...] "no comment" [...] to make {{in response to the}} release. Ben Gerson, writing for Rolling Stone, found the singer to be [...] "unconvincingly animal" [...] throughout her rendition. He continued, [...] "Being beautiful, romantic and desirable have not come to her so effortlessly that she can easily throw them over for the sake a little authentic, malodorous sweat." ...|$|E
500|$|Pennington {{argues that}} American Beauty defines its {{characters}} through their sexuality. Lester's attempts to relive his youth are {{a direct result}} of his lust for Angela, and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact. Also sexually frustrated, Carolyn has an affair that takes her from [...] "cold perfectionist" [...] to a more carefree soul who [...] " [...] happily along with" [...] the music in her car. Jane and Angela constantly reference sex, through Angela's descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other. Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability. By the end of the film, Angela's hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester's attraction to her. Col. Fitts reacts with disgust to meeting Jim and Jim; he asks, [...] "How come these faggots always have to <b>rub</b> <b>it</b> in your face? How can they be so shameless?" [...] To which Ricky replies, [...] "That's the thing, Dad—they don't feel like it's anything to be ashamed of." [...] Pennington argues that Col. Fitts' reaction is not homophobic, but an [...] "anguished self-interrogation".|$|E

50|$|Wild {{raccoons}} often investigate {{their food}} by <b>rubbing</b> <b>it</b> between their paws while holding the food underwater, giving {{the appearance of}} 'washing' the food (although the exact motivation for this behaviour is disputed). Captive raccoons sometimes perform these actions of 'washing' their food by <b>rubbing</b> <b>it</b> between their paws, even {{when there is no}} water available. This is most likely a vacuum activity based on foraging behaviour at shorelines.|$|R

2500|$|Several primate species self-anoint {{with various}} {{items such as}} millipedes, leaves and fruit. [...] They {{sometimes}} drool while doing this. [...] Both capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys perform urine washing, when they deposit a small quantity of urine onto the palm of a hand and then <b>rub</b> <b>it</b> on the sole of the opposite foot. It {{is thought to have}} multiple functions including hygiene, thermoregulation and response to irritation from biting ectoparasites (such as ticks and botfly).

2500|$|For England Neil Foster {{returned}} to the side {{in place of the}} injured DeFreitas, while the Australians played Tim May as a second spinner at the expense of Julian. [...] Australia won the toss and made the most of excellent batting conditions. [...] Taylor and Slater demolished the England bowling as they added 260 for the first wicket, and batted almost the entire day. [...] Both fell in the hour prior to the close after compiling superb centuries. [...] Taylor's second of the series (111) was made off 243 balls and comprised ten fours and a six, while Slater's 152 rattled along a bit faster, and included 18 boundaries. [...] Boon and Mark Waugh took up the gauntlet on the second day and added another 175 to <b>rub</b> <b>it</b> in, with Waugh falling to Phil Tufnell just one shy of his century. [...] Boon went on to enjoy another century partnership with Allan Border (77), before the captain finally declared the innings on the third morning, Boon ending up not out on 164.|$|E
