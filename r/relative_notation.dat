I will stop myself then on the relationship between social culture, agents and tourism, and will conclude with some <b>relative</b> <b>notation</b> to the problem of the "insularità". The main task is that, not giving a priori to relations univoche between tourism and society, which cultural phenomenon is from turning particular attention to the olistica nature of the tourism and to its peculiar "evolution".

40|$|The {{functional}} <b>notation</b> <b>relative</b> to -calculi {{provides a}} simple method for establishing the implicit relations between concepts and object-as-functor constructions. Prior research has mainly bypassed the semantic characterization of concepts {{and has been}} focused on the descriptive issues. This paper considers the functional notation for individuals and presents a functional approach to creation of metaobjects with increasing /decreasing degree of intensionality. The data object model is determined to be intensionally scalable with variable ranges over schematic individuals. The cross-referencing of ranges is reected by a kind of indexed structure that gives a parameterized evaluation map for logical constructs. Their evaluation gives rise to variable domains and concepts as indexed families of metaobjects...|$|R

The carbon and oxygen isotope values were measured using a Finnigan Kiel-III carbonate preparation device (Perkin-Elmer Inc., Wellesley, MA, USA) directly coupled to the inlet of a Finnigan MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The results are reported in per mil <b>notation</b> <b>relative</b> to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) standard. The precision and calibration of the data were monitored through routine analysis of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS)- 18 and NBS- 19 carbonate standards. The precision was better than ± 0.1  ‰ internally for both the carbon and oxygen isotope values.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the lithofacies description and XRD analysis, the inorganic carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of carbonate samples were analyzed at Tokyo Institute of Technology. Powdered samples were reacted with > 100  % phosphoric acid at 80  °C for > 12  h using a Thermoquest GasBench II. The extracted CO 2 was separated in a chromatography line with a helium flow, and the carbon and oxygen isotope ratios were measured with a DELTA Plus XL mass spectrometer, following {{a modified version of}} the method in Revesz and Landwehr (2002). The carbonate carbon and oxygen isotope compositions (δ 13 Ccarb and δ 18 Ocarb) are reported in per mil <b>notation</b> <b>relative</b> to Vienna Peedee Belemnite (‰ VPDB). The analytical reproducibility of the δ 13 Ccarb and δ 18 Ocarb values, determined by replicate analyses of the laboratory standard, were better than 0.3 and 0.4 [*]‰, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Multiple-collector {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass {{spectrometry}} {{has been used for}} the precise measurement of the isotopic composition of Se in geological samples. Se is chemically purified before analysis by using cotton impregnated with thioglycollic acid. This preconcentration step is required for the removal of matrix-interfering elements for hydride generation, such as transitional metals, and also for the quantitative separation of other hydride-forming elements, such as Ge, Sb, and As. The analyte is introduced in the plasma torch with a continuous-flow hydride generation system. Instrumental mass fractionation is corrected with a "standard-sample bracketing" approach. By use of this new technique, the minimum Se required per analysis is lowered to 10 ng, which is one order of magnitude less than the amount needed for the N-TIMS technique. The estimated external precision calculated for the 82 Se/ 76 Se isotope ratio is 0. 25 ? (2 sigma), and the data are reported as delta <b>notation</b> (?) <b>relative</b> to our internal standard (MERCK elemental standard solution). Measurements of Se isotopes are presented for samples of standard solutions and geological reference materials, such as silicate rocks, soils, and sediments. The Se isotopic composition of selected terrestrial and extraterrestrial materials are also presented. An overall Se isotope variation of 8 ? has been observed, suggesting that Se isotopes fractionate readily and are extremely useful tracers of natural processes...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The Baqoroq Cu-Zn-As deposit {{is located}} {{northeast}} of the town ofAnarak in Isfahan province, in theeast central areaof Iran. Copper mineralization occursin upper cretaceous carbonate rocks. Studyof thegeologyof the Nakhlak area, the location ofa carbonate-hosted base metaldeposit, indicatesthe importance of stratigraphic, lithological and structural controls in the placement of this ore deposit. (Jazi et al., 2015). Some of the most world’s most important epigenetic, stratabound and discordant copperdeposits are the carbonate hosted Tsumeb and Kipushi type deposits,located in Africa. The Baqoroq deposit {{is believed to be}} of this type. Materials and methods In the current study, fifty rock samples were collected from old tunnels and surface mineralization. Twenty-two thin sections, ten polished sections and four thin-polished sections were prepared for microscopic study. Ten samples were selected for elemental analysis by ICP-OES (Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry) by the Zar Azma Company (Tehran) and AAS (Atomic absorption spectrometry) at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. Seven doubly polished sections of barite mineralization were prepared for microthermometric analysis. Homogenization and last ice-melting temperatures were measured using a Linkam THMSG 600 combined heating and freezing stage at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. Sulfur isotopes of five barite samples were determined by the Iso-Analytical Ltd. Company of the UK. The isotopic ratios are presented in per mil (‰) <b>notation</b> <b>relative</b> to the Canyon Diablo Troilite. Results The upper Cretaceoushost rocks of the Baqoroq deposit include limestone, sandstone, and conglomerate units. Mineralization is controlled by two main factors: lithostratigraphy and structure. Epigenetic Cu-Zn mineralizationoccurs in ore zones as stratabound barite and barite-calcite veins and minor disseminated mineralization. Open space filling occurred as breccia matrix, crustification banding,andbotryoidaltexture. The host rock has undergone dolomitization alteration Hypogene minerals include chalcopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite, galena, enargite, barite, and calcite. Supergene minerals include malachite, azurite, covellite, chrysocolla, chalcocite, cerussite, smithsonite, native copper and iron oxide minerals. Sulfantimonides and sulfardenides are abundant in low- and moderate temperature stages of the deposit, while bismuth sulfides generally occur in higher temperature ores, according to Malakhov, 1968. Analysis of rich ore samples indicates copper is the most abundant heavy metal in the ore (average 20. 28 wt...|$|R
40|$|The use of zinc {{isotopes}} {{to trace}} anthropogenic sources in coastal areas {{has been tested}} in this study. We determined the stable isotopic composition of zinc in sediment cores, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and rocks collected at the Sepetiba Bay (southeastern Brazil), an estuarine lagoon heavily impacted by metallurgic activities. These isotopic signatures were compared with those from willemite ore, which represent the main mineral refined by the major industrial source of zinc. The aim was to test if this tracer system enables to identify sources and sinks of anthropogenic zinc and to reconstruct the temporal and spatial evolution of zinc contamination. The zinc isotopic compositions (expressed using the δ 66 Zn <b>notation</b> <b>relative</b> to the JMC 3 - 0749 -L solution) showed significant variations in the sediment cores, the SPM, and willemite ore minerals, ranging between − 0. 01 and + 1. 15 ‰. Spatial and temporal analysis of sediments samples fit well in a model of mixing involving three main end-members: i) Terrestrial background (δ 66 ZnJMC = + 0. 28 ± 0. 12 ‰, 2 σ); ii) marine detrital material (δ 66 ZnJMC = + 0. 45 ± 0. 03 ‰, 2 σ); and iii) a major anthropogenic source associated with electroplating wastes released into the bay (δ 66 ZnJMC = + 0. 86 ± 0. 15 ‰, 2 σ). Sediment cores collected in the mud flats showed high correlation between δ 66 Zn and zinc enrichment factors, suggesting good preservation of the isotopic records of natural and anthropogenic sources. The sediment core sampled from a mangrove wetland located in a zone impacted by the metallurgy presented levels of zinc up to 4 % (sediment dry weight) and preserved the isotopic signatures of electroplating wastes, despite evidences that post depositional processes slightly changed the isotopic signatures in some layers from this core toward heavier δ 66 ZnJMC values (above + 1. 0 ‰). A two component mixing model suggests contributions of this major anthropogenic Zn source up to nearly 80 % during periods of electroplating activities. Our work suggests that Zn isotope compositions of sediments are reliable tracers of anthropogenic sources and, therefore, can be useful to improve environmental monitoring efforts in coastal systems...|$|R
