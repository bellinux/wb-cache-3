5|$|Funerals {{among the}} Antankarana are often celebratory events. Among villagers living near the sea, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} for the remains of a loved one to be placed in a coffin which the family carries <b>running</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons <b>running</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Black Canyon slope {{in the wrong}} {{direction}} for water to flow into the canyon. It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black Canyon and could not change its course.|$|E
5|$|Following halftime, Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the second half. Texas' kickoff was fielded by Antonio Banks, who returned it to the Tech 41-yard line. On the first play of the half, Thomas was tackled for a loss of two yards on a running play up the middle. After an incomplete pass, Druckenmiller completed a pass to Jennings, who fell down short of the first down marker. The Hokies punted, but Texas was called for a five-yard <b>running</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> kicker penalty and Tech opted to re-kick. After the second kick, Texas' offense started at its 17-yard line.|$|E

5|$|Heroes of Mana {{opens with}} a {{reconnaissance}} mission {{by a group of}} soldiers from Pedda into the beastman kingdom of Ferolia. The group, including the soldier Roget and his captain Yerchael, are on their airship, the Nightswan, when they are shot down by Ferolian ships. After crash-landing in a forest and getting separated, Roget and Yurchael fight their way back {{to the rest of the}} group through the Ferolian army before <b>running</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Peddan military. The Peddans claim not to know about the group and attack them; after fleeing Roget and Yurchael discover that Pedda is invading Ferolia, and attacking peaceful villages as they do. Unable to support the invasion, the group rebels against Pedda and joins forces with the Ferolians.|$|E
5|$|NC State went {{three and}} out after {{receiving}} the ball, and after Tech incurred a <b>running</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> kicker penalty on the first punt attempt, NC State punted the ball away. After the kick, Tech took over on offense at its 27-yard line. On Tech's first play after the punt, however, Hunter fumbled the ball after a 10-yard rush. NC State recovered the ball, and the Wolfpack offense returned to the field at the Tech 40-yard line. On their first play after the fumble recover, Kramer completed a 12-yard pass to Worthen for a first down. During the next play, Kramer fumbled the ball while attempting to run with it, and Virginia Tech's defense recovered. This allowed the Tech offense {{to return to the}} field and attempt another offensive drive beginning at their 27-yard line.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{incidents}} in recent years where the river has been polluted and fish have been killed. In 2004 a pipe was broken by builders while they were working on the upgrade of the Fofanny water treatment works, near the source of the river. This resulted in sediment <b>running</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> river and the flooding of the plant. Fish were not directly harmed by this incident, and the Water Service carried out an investigation to assure drinking water had not been affected. However, concerns were raised by the Shimna Anglers Club that this was not the first time building work had affected the river, and that there was the possibility of long term harm to the salmon and sea trout.|$|E

5|$|Written and {{directed}} by Welles at Toland's suggestion, the theatrical trailer for Citizen Kane differs from other trailers in {{that it did not}} feature a single second of footage of the actual film itself, but acts as a wholly original, tongue-in-cheek, pseudo-documentary piece on the film's production. Filmed {{at the same time as}} Citizen Kane itself, it offers the only existing behind-the-scenes footage of the film. The trailer, shot by Wild instead of Toland, follows an unseen Welles as he provides narration for a tour around the film set, introductions to the film's core cast members, and a brief overview of Kane's character. The trailer also contains a number of trick shots, including one of Everett Sloane appearing at first to be <b>running</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> camera, which turns out to be the reflection of the camera in a mirror.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} it went into battle at Lepel on 6 July, the corps was at two-thirds of its {{strength}} due to breakdowns. The corps also attacked without air support and with a shortage of anti-aircraft guns, fuel, and ammunition. Alekseyenko deployed the corps in two echelons: the 13th and 17th Tank Divisions attacked first, with the 109th Motorised Division in the second echelon. The 17th Tank Division ran into the 17th Panzer Division at Senno on 6 July {{at the beginning of}} the counterattack. The 13th Tank Division was attacked on its left flank by the 18th Panzer Division after advancing farther west than the 17th Tank Division. By 10 July the corps had been mostly destroyed. In the Orsha area the retreating corps was given replacement tanks and ordered to resume the attack the next day. The corps counterattacked toward Vitebsk from the south in conjunction with the 7th Mechanised Corps. <b>Running</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 7th and 12th Panzer Divisions, the combined losses of both corps totalled 100 tanks.|$|E
5|$|New Ironsides {{completed}} her overhaul in late August 1864, {{now under the}} command of Commodore William Radford, but did not join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in Hampton Roads until October when her crew finished gunnery training. She participated in a major assault in December on Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in an effort to stop blockade <b>running</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> port of Wilmington. Though this attack was called off on Christmas Day after an extensive bombardment, the Union fleet returned to resume the operation on 13 January 1865. New Ironsides was one of several warships that heavily shelled Fort Fisher, preparing the way for a ground assault that captured the position on 15 January. Afterward and for the next few months, New Ironsides supported Union activities on the James River. She was decommissioned on 6 April 1865 and was laid up at League Island, Philadelphia, where, on the night of 16 December 1865, New Ironsides was destroyed by a fire. The ship was towed to shallow water where she burned and sank. Her wreck was salvaged and her boilers were offered for sale in 1869.|$|E

While the {{recently}} promised Prince Joffrey and Sansa Stark are walking along the river, they run into Arya sparring with sticks with her friend, a butcher's boy named Mycah. Taunting the boy, Joffrey draws his sword and demands a duel, under pretext of punishing him for accidentally hitting Arya, {{a member of the}} nobility. Mycah and Arya desperately explain that she asked him to spar with her so she could practice. As Joffrey savors the butcher boy's pain and fear, Arya hits Joffrey while her friend flees. Enraged, Joffrey turns on Arya and is about to strike her with his sword when her direwolf Nymeria bites his wrist. Arya seizes his sword and throws it into the river before <b>running</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forest, where she drives away Nymeria and hides until dark.|$|E
5|$|Partway {{through the}} series, the show's unseen camera {{operator}} and editor, Robert Walton, dies from a fall while adventuring in Alaska, where {{his body is}} left partially preserved in the snow. Frankenstein becomes distraught and attempts to revive Walton's corpse with DeLacey's help in secret using the medical technologies she had expounded upon earlier in the show. The attempt is successful, but the revived creature is startled by light and escapes the lab, <b>running</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woods. Later, as Frankenstein and Lavenza are trying to locate the creature from her father's basement, Clerval is killed mysteriously while camping. The creature confronts Frankenstein and asks her {{to make him a}} friend. She grows morally opposed to the idea of recreating her experiment and agrees to run off to Costa Rica with Lavenza after he confesses his love to her. The creature returns to her makeshift lab and kills Lavenza in anger after he tries to stop it from hurting Frankenstein.|$|E
