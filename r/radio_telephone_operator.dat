5000|$|A student's {{graduation}} {{is highly}} dependent on their performance in graded positions of leadership. This leadership ability is evaluated at various levels in various situations, and is observed while {{he or she is}} in one of typically two graded leadership roles per phase. The student can either meet the high standards and be given a [...] "GO" [...] by the R.I., or can fail to meet this standard and receive the dreaded [...] "NO GO". The student must demonstrate the ability to meet the standard in order to move forward, and can thus only afford one unsuccessful patrol. The student's success will lie in his ability to essentially manipulate those directly underneath their charge of leadership. At times, this will be as few as two to three people—and at other times the student may be required to lead up to an entire 45-person platoon. The student's success can be dependent on the performance and teamwork of these individuals, whom he or she must motivate and lead. Missions are typically broken up into four stages: planning, movement, actions on the objective, and establishment of a patrol base. The Platoon Leader position (in Mountains and Florida) will be rotated throughout the mission, and {{the same is true for}} the platoon sergeant position.

50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}}. Pfc. Lee distinguished himself near the city of Phu Bai in the province of Thua Thien. Pfc. Lee was serving as the <b>radio</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>operator</b> with the 3d platoon, Company B. As lead element for the company, the 3d platoon received intense surprise hostile fire from a force of North Vietnamese Army regulars in well-concealed bunkers. With 50 percent casualties, the platoon maneuvered to a position of cover to treat their wounded and reorganize, while Pfc. Lee moved through the heavy enemy fire giving lifesaving first aid to his wounded comrades. During the subsequent assault on the enemy defensive positions, Pfc. Lee continuously kept close radio contact with the company commander, relaying precise and understandable orders to his platoon leader. While advancing with the front rank toward the objective, Pfc. Lee observed 4 North Vietnamese soldiers with automatic weapons and a rocket launcher lying in wait for the lead element of the platoon. As the element moved forward, unaware of the concealed danger, Pfc. Lee immediately and with utter disregard for his own personal safety, passed his radio to another soldier and charged through the murderous fire. Without hesitation he continued his assault, overrunning the enemy position, killing all occupants and capturing 4 automatic weapons and a rocket launcher. Pfc. Lee continued his 1-man assault on the second position through a heavy barrage of enemy automatic weapons fire. Grievously wounded, he continued to press the attack, crawling forward into a firing position and delivering accurate covering fire to enable his platoon to maneuver and destroy the position. Not until the position was overrun did Pfc. Lee falter in his steady volume of fire and succumb to his wounds. Pfc. Lee's heroic actions saved the lives of the lead element and were instrumental in the destruction of the key position of the enemy defense. Pfc. Lee's gallantry at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on himself, the 502d Infantry, and the U.S. Army.|$|E

Sgt. Lynch (then Sp4c.) distinguished himself while serving as a <b>radio</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>operator</b> with Company D. While serving in the forward element on an operation near the village of My An, his unit became heavily engaged with a numerically superior enemy force. Quickly and accurately assessing the situation, Sgt. Lynch provided his commander with information which subsequently proved essential to the unit's successful actions. Observing 3 wounded comrades Lying exposed to enemy fire, Sgt. Lynch dashed across 50 meters of open ground through a withering hail of enemy fire to administer aid. Reconnoitering a nearby trench for a covered position to protect the wounded from intense hostile fire, he killed 2 enemy soldiers at point blank range. With the trench cleared, he unhesitatingly returned to the fire-swept area 3 times to carry the wounded men to safety. When his company was forced to withdraw by the superior firepower of the enemy, Sgt. Lynch remained to aid his comrades {{at the risk of}} his life rather than abandon them. Alone, he defended his isolated position for 2 hours against the advancing enemy. Using only his rifle and a grenade, he stopped them just short of his trench, killing 5. Again, disregarding his safety in the face of withering hostile fire, he crossed 70 meters of exposed terrain 5 times to carry his wounded comrades to a more secure area. Once he had assured their comfort and safety, Sgt. Lynch located the counterattacking friendly company to assist in directing the attack and evacuating the 3 casualties. His gallantry at the risk of his life is in the highest traditions of the military service, Sgt. Lynch has reflected great credit on himself, the 12th Cavalry, and the U.S. Army.|$|E

As the soldiers traversed a narrow path surrounded by mountainous, rocky terrain, they were ambushed by enemy forces from elevated positions. Pinned against a steep mountain face, Specialist White and his fellow soldiers were completely exposed to enemy fire. Specialist White returned fire and was briefly knocked unconscious when a rocket-propelled grenade impacted near him.When he regained consciousness, another round impacted near him, embedding small pieces of shrapnel in his face. Shaking off his wounds, Specialist White noticed one of his comrades lying wounded nearby. Without hesitation, Specialist White exposed himself to enemy fire in order to reach the soldier and provide medical aid.After applying a tourniquet, Specialist White moved to an injured Marine, providing aid and comfort until the Marine succumbed to his wounds. Specialist White then returned to the soldier and discovered that he had been wounded again. Applying his own belt as an additional tourniquet, Specialist White was able to stem the flow of blood and save the soldier's life.Noticing that his and the other soldiers' radios were inoperative, Specialist White exposed himself to enemy fire yet again in order to secure a radio from a deceased comrade. He then provided information and updates to friendly forces, allowing precision airstrikes to stifle the enemy's attack and ultimately permitting medical evacuation aircraft to rescue him, his fellow soldiers, Marines, and Afghan army soldiers.Specialist Kyle J.

After breaching an insurgent perimeter, Specialist Four Erevia was designated by his platoon leader to render first aid to several casualties, and the rest of the platoon moved forward. As he was doing so, he came under intense hostile fire from four bunkers to his left front. Although he could have taken cover with the rest of the element, he chose a retaliatory course of action. With heavy enemy fire directed at him, he moved in full view of the hostile gunners as he proceeded to crawl from one wounded man to another, gathering ammunition. Armed with two M-16 rifles and several hand grenades, he charged toward the enemy positions behind the suppressive fire of the two rifles. Under very intense fire, he continued to advance on the insurgents until he was near the first bunker. Disregarding the enemy fire, he pulled the pin from a hand grenade and advanced on the bunker, leveling suppressive fire until he could drop the grenade into the bunker, mortally wounding the insurgent and destroying the fortification. Without hesitation, he employed identical tactics as he proceeded to eliminate the next two enemy positions. With the destruction of the third bunker, Specialist Four Erevia had exhausted his supply of hand grenades. Still under intense fire from the fourth position, he courageously charged forward behind the fire emitted by his M-16 rifles. Arriving at the very edge of the bunker, he silenced the occupant within the fortification at point blank range. Through his heroic actions the lives of the wounded were saved and the members of the Company Command Post were relieved from a very precarious situation. His exemplary performance in the face of overwhelming danger was an inspiration to his entire company and contributed immeasurably to the success of the mission. Specialist Four Erevia’s conspicuous gallantry, extraordinary heroism, and intrepidity {{at the risk}} of his own life, above and beyond the call of duty, were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.Citation represents Soldier's rank at time of action.|$|E

Family trees mention the following family names:Bacharach, Bernheimer, Fold, Foldner, Gold, Goldschmidt, Gutmann, Heineimann, Kirchhausen, Levi, Markus, Nussbaum, Rothschild, Schloss, and Stern. There was a copy of the New York Times (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut edition) from Wednesday, Oct. 31, 1990 included with the donationJakob Markus was born in Lohr am Main on October 10, 1888 to the merchant Leopold Markus and his wife Therese née Schloss. Jakob Markus was a textile merchant in Lohr with a shop on Hauptstrasse (Adolf-Hitler-Strasse during the 1930 s). He married Selma née Bernheimer, the daughter of the merchant Heinrich Bernheimer and his wife Lisette née Rothschild. Selma and Jakob Markus had two children, Resi (born 1924) and Walter (born 1929). Jakob Markus was arrested on Kristallnacht in November 1938. He was released from prison eight days later under the condition that he and his family emigrate as soon as possible. The family arrived in the United States in May of 1939 and settled in New York City. With the sponsorship of Sol May of Chicago, the family was able to procure an immigration visa for Selma’s mother, Lisette Bernheimer. They struggled in vain to assist with the immigration of Jakob Markus’ niece Lotte Stern as well as Jakob Markus’ sister Elsa Goldbach, her husband, and two sons. After finishing school in New York, Walter Markus became a <b>radio</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>operator</b> and later a printer. Resi (alternatively Rosi after immigration) Markus married and moved to Israel. Several Markus family members made restitution claims from the late 1940 s through the 1970 s. Jakob Markus was awarded restitution for damages to his property because of emigration and moving costs as well as the payment of special taxes. Selma Markus was successful in her claim of damages to her career, and Walter Markus was successful in claiming damages to his education. Jakob Markus died in 1958, and Selma Markus in 1979.
