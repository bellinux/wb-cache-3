5000|$|The clutch is {{typically}} disengaged by a thrust bearing that makes contact with pressure petals on the clutch ring plate and pushes them inward to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pad friction. Normally the bearing remains retracted {{away from the}} petals and does not spin. However, the bearing can be [...] "burned out" [...] and damaged by using the clutch pedal as a foot rest, which causes the bearing to spin continuously from touching the clutch plates.|$|E
50|$|Riding {{the clutch}} {{occurs when the}} driver does not fully <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal. This results in the clutch disc {{slipping}} against the flywheel and some engine power not being transferred to the drive train and wheels. While inefficient, most drivers routinely use this technique effectively when driving in reverse (as fully engaging the reverse gear results in velocity too great for the short distance traveled) or in stop-and-go traffic (as {{it is easier to}} control the throttle and acceleration at very slow speeds).|$|E
50|$|The {{clutch in}} a manual-shift {{motorcycle}} transmission is typically {{an arrangement of}} plates stacked in alternating fashion, one geared on the inside to the engine and the next geared on the outside to the transmission input shaft. Whether wet (rotating in engine oil) or dry, the plates are squeezed together by a spring, causing friction build up between the plates until they rotate as a single unit, driving the transmission directly. A lever on the handlebar exploits mechanical advantage through a cable or hydraulic arrangement to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> spring(s), allowing the engine to freewheel {{with respect to the}} transmission.|$|E
5000|$|The {{accelerator}} (throttle) is <b>released,</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal is pressed, and {{the gearbox}} is shifted into neutral.|$|R
5000|$|When <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal {{is fully}} <b>released,</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is fully engaged {{and all of}} the engine's torque is transferred. In this coupled state, <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> does not slip, but rather acts as rigid {{coupling}} to transmit power to the gearbox.|$|R
50|$|Noise 2: This noise, {{commonly}} referred to as gear rattle, can be induced by lugging the engine in any gear, but is usually most noticeable in first or second gear. While the noise is occurring, if you press lightly on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal without <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch,</b> <b>the</b> noise will be reduced or eliminated.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{electrical}} {{gear shift}} mechanism sold on new automobiles was the Vulcan electric gear shift system, a solenoid-driven transmission shift device for a standard sliding gear gearbox {{introduced in the}} summer of 1913. Among the automakers to offer the Vulcan system were the Haynes Automobile Company of Kokomo, Indiana the S.G.V. Company of Reading, Pennsylvania and the Norwalk Motor Car Company of Martinsburg, West Virginia. While the Vulcan shifter was often advertised as standard equipment on the Haynes car, a common floor shift was also available for $200 less. Norwalk made the Vulcan system available on their products, such as the Underslung Six, as an option; approximately 25 of those cars were so equipped. A large nickel-plated box was attached to {{the right side of the}} steering column which housed the push button mechanism. It utilized six buttons - first through third gear, reverse, neutral and park. There was also a [...] "signal" [...] button which was the horn. A housing containing four large solenoids was mounted at the transmission which acted on the steel transmission shift control rods. The driver was free to select any gear at will, enabling the bypassing of gears, such as jumping from first to third gear without going through second gear. There was a cautionary advisory with the car that one must use care when placing the selector into reverse, only doing so when the car was completely stopped. Pushing a button on the shift control preselected the chosen gear. The electrical circuit was closed only after the driver fully depressed the clutch pedal. This energized the appropriate transmission mounted solenoids necessary for returning the transmission to neutral and then completing engagement of the preselected gear; the driver would then <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal to continue onwards. These seemed to have been very advanced automotive systems. The Vulcan Electric Shift Company was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and was eventually bought out by Cutler-Hammer. The model year 1914 was the only year that Norwalk used this system. Only one known Norwalk Motor Car survives today, which is owned by the friends of the Norwalk Foundation, Inc. in Martinsburg. Haynes was evidently the only automaker of note to place the push-buttons in the center of the steering wheel. The Vulcan electric gear shift system probably didn't survive past the early 1920s, since nothing regarding it has been found in the automotive engineering literature past 1921, and a 1919 Haynes print ad has been found with no mention of the electric shifting system.|$|E

50|$|The driver {{would use}} <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal any time when {{selecting}} low, high, or reverse gear. Once underway, the accelerator could be eased {{and the car}} would engage the overdrive. With the Fluid Drive coupling, the car could be brought {{to a halt in}} gear without <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> and would creep like an automatic.|$|R
50|$|Slipping <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as feathering <b>the</b> <b>clutch)</b> is a term used by automotive enthusiasts to describe when the driver alternately applies and <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> to achieve some movement of the car. It's called slipping because <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> plate will slip against the flywheel surface when such an action is performed. Slipping <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is known to be}} hard on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> surface due to the sliding friction created.|$|R
5000|$|When {{shifting}} properly, {{the driver}} [...] "shifts" [...] to another gear and then <b>releases</b> pressure on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal to re-engage {{the engine to}} the driveshaft. If <b>the</b> pedal is <b>released</b> quickly, a definite lurch can be felt as the engine and driveshaft re-engage and their speeds equalize. However, if <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is <b>released</b> slowly <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> disc will [...] "slip" [...] against the flywheel; this friction permits the engine a smoother transition to its new rotation speed. Such routine slippage causes wear on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> analogous to <b>the</b> wear-and-tear on a brake pad when stopping. Some amount of wear is unavoidable, but with better clutching/shifting technique it can be minimized by <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> {{as close to the}} correct engine speed for the gear and vehicle speed as possible. When upshifting, this will involve allowing the engine speed to fall. Conversely, when downshifting, increasing the engine speed with the accelerator prior to releasing clutch will result in a smoother transition and minimal clutch wear.|$|R
50|$|Making a sharp {{right hand}} turn will usually stop the noise. While {{the noise is}} occurring, in order to {{distinguish}} between the two noises, you can press lightly on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal without <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> and <b>the</b> noise will NOT go away or change. As a second diagnostic aid, while the vehicle is making the noise, shift to third gear and the noise will stop.|$|R
5000|$|On {{vehicles}} with a manual transmission, cruise control is less flexible because {{the act of}} depressing <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal and shifting gears usually disengages the cruise control. The [...] "resume" [...] feature has to be used each time after selecting the new gear and <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> Therefore, cruise control is of most benefit at motorway/highway speeds when top gear is used virtually all the time.|$|R
5000|$|A better {{method is}} to {{downshift}} to a lower gear that would spin the engine within its RPM limit, and use the throttle to [...] "Rev match" [...] the engine to the road speed before <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> fully. Effective engine braking is still achieved {{with little or no}} excessive clutch wear.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> appears {{outwardly}} {{similar to}} most other multi-plate clutches. A stack of plates is enclosed in a housing with a divided central shaft. Alternate plates are keyed {{to either the}} input or output shafts, through either the inner or outer housings. A pressure plate is arranged {{at one end of}} the stack so that an axial force may be applied, compressing the stack and causing it to transmit <b>the</b> drive. <b>Releasing</b> <b>the</b> pressure <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The right pedal applies iron-lined {{external}} bands on {{the rear}} brake drums through levers and horizontal shafts. The left pedal first <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> then when moved further the same pedal to ease the gear change applies the brake on the propellor shaft drum behind the gearbox. Steering is by rack and pinion. Wheels are of steel wire with tangent spokes.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Porter <b>released</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> {{and set out}} on her drive. She rarely had a settled {{route for}} these outings of hers, preferring to zigzag about New York, livening up the great city at random. She always drove herself and, having, like a good suffragist, a {{contempt}} for male prohibitions, took an honest pleasure in exceeding a man-made speed limit.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} way to push start a vehicle {{is to put}} the manual {{transmission}} in second gear typically, switching the ignition to on/run, depressing <b>the</b> <b>clutch,</b> and pushing <b>the</b> vehicle until it is at a speed of 5 to 10 mph or more, then quickly <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> to make <b>the</b> engine rotate and fire, then quickly depressing <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> so it does not stall. This is done by one person pushing a lightweight automobile, pulling or being pushed by another vehicle or even rolling down a hill.|$|R
50|$|When {{the driver}} stops the vehicle on an incline where {{the nose of}} the car is {{sufficiently}} higher than the rear of the car, the system is engaged when the driver's foot is depressing the brake pedal, and then <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal is fully depressed. Once set, the driver must keep <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal fully depressed but may remove the foot from the brake pedal. To disengage the system and move the car forward, the driver selects first gear, gently depresses the fuel pedal, and slowly <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal which at a point in its travel <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> braking system, allowing the car to proceed.|$|R
50|$|When the {{handbrake}} {{is applied}} the (otherwise fixed) {{end of the}} spring is moved forward by a cam which <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> and <b>the</b> car may stop without affecting the engine. Application of the footbrake has the same effect. This arrangement was deleted from the next model now the driver has control of the throttles and engine braking {{may be used to}} reduce the load on the brakes.|$|R
50|$|There is {{essentially}} {{no difference in}} efficiency between the technique of bypassing the throttle butterfly and operating the butterfly itself. The IAC allows the ECU to maintain minimum RPM irrespective of changes in engine load, {{sometimes referred to as}} anti-stall feature. Thus the driver can more easily move the car from stand-still by merely <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> (manual transmission) or the brake (automatic transmission) without having to simultaneously press the accelerator.|$|R
50|$|Jim and Nash {{abandon the}} patrol car and hike to a motel. While Jim is in the shower, Ryder abducts Nash.

Esteridge tells Jim that his men cannot shoot Ryder as his foot will slip off <b>the</b> <b>clutch,</b> which would cause the truck to roll and kill Nash. Jim enters the cab with Ryder, who gives him a pistol and tells him to shoot, but Jim is unable. Ryder, disappointed, <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch,</b> killing Nash.|$|R
50|$|Butterfly clutch - One of {{the most}} popular modern methods of {{attaching}} pins is <b>the</b> butterfly <b>clutch,</b> sometimes called a military <b>clutch.</b> <b>The</b> back of the pin has a small prong attached and when <b>the</b> butterfly <b>clutch</b> is squeezed and pulled up from the prong <b>the</b> pin is <b>released</b> from <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> Butterfly clutches may be made out of metal, plastic, or rubber.|$|R

60|$|Sir George stepped in. The Vicomte, {{in whose}} fingers the wheel seemed {{scarcely}} to rest, so light and apparently careless was his touch, touched a lever by his side, <b>released</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch,</b> and swung <b>the</b> great car {{round the corner}} at a speed which made Duncombe grasp the sides. At a pace which seemed to him most ridiculous, they dashed into the Rue de Rivoli, and with another sharp turn pulled up before Maxim's. The Vicomte rose with a yawn {{as though he had}} just awoke from a refreshing dream. His servant slipped off his fur coat, and he descended to the pavement faultlessly dressed and quite unruffled. The commissionaire preceded them, hat in hand, to the door. A couple of waiters ushered them to the table which the Vicomte intimated by a gesture.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, the BAII F6 Typhoon was disqualified from Motor {{magazines}} annual Performance Car of the Year competition due to {{a series}} of clutch failures.

But the engine, after three Herculean throbs, ceased to work. Mr. Britling with a convulsive clutch at his steering wheel set the electric hooter snarling, while one foot <b>released</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> again and <b>the</b> other, on the accelerator, sought in vain for help. Mr. Direck felt they were going back, back, in spite of all this vocalisation. He <b>clutched</b> at <b>the</b> emergency brake. But he was too late to avoid misfortune.

5000|$|There are {{multiple}} designs of vehicle clutch, {{but most are}} based on one or more friction discs pressed tightly together or against a flywheel using springs. The friction material varies in composition depending on many considerations such as whether <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is [...] "dry" [...] or [...] "wet". Friction discs once contained asbestos, but this has been largely discontinued. Clutches found in heavy duty applications such as trucks and competition cars use ceramic plates that have a greatly increased friction coefficient. However, these have a [...] "grabby" [...] action generally considered unsuitable for passenger cars. The spring pressure is <b>released</b> when <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal is depressed thus either pushing or pulling the diaphragm of the pressure plate, depending on type. Raising the engine speed too high while engaging <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> causes excessive clutch plate wear. Engaging <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> abruptly when <b>the</b> engine is turning at high speed causes a harsh, jerky start. This kind of start is necessary and desirable in drag racing and other competitions, where speed {{is more important than}} comfort.|$|R
5000|$|Double-clutching {{allows the}} driver to control the engine and {{transmission}} revolutions to synchronize, so that a smooth shift can be made; for example, when upshifting, the accelerator pedal is <b>released</b> and <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal is depressed while the gear lever is moved into neutral, <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal is then released and quickly pushed down again while the gear lever is moved to the next higher gear. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal is <b>released</b> and <b>the</b> accelerator pedal pushed down to obtain required engine speed. Although this is a relatively fast movement, perhaps a second or so while transmission is in neutral, it allows the engine speed to drop and synchronize engine and transmission revolutions relative to the road speed. Downshifting is performed in a similar fashion, except the engine speed is now required to increase (while transmission is in neutral) {{just the right amount}} in order to achieve the synchronization for a smooth, non-collision gear change. [...] "Skip changing" [...] is also widely used; in principle operation is the same as double-clutching, but it requires neutral be held slightly longer than a single-gear change.|$|R
50|$|Having {{destroyed}} the demons, Vaikundar thought of incarcerating {{the powers of}} Malaiyarasar, {{the people of the}} mountain who performed black magic, witchcraft, sorcery, etc., with the aid of evil spirits. No sooner had he thought of it than the wild animals, being <b>released</b> from <b>the</b> <b>clutches</b> of <b>the</b> Malaiyaracar, went berserk and attacked the people ferociously. Horrified at the behaviour of the animals, the Malaiyaracar resorted to their usual black magic to contain the animals. But, alas, this time, their magic did not work. Disappointed and worried, they became panicky and sought the help of a Kuratti, the village astrologer, to make them known the cause of these events.|$|R
