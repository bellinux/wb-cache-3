It is combined with a quantitative assessment <b>of</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> power <b>supply</b> with two reliability indicators, regarding that intermittent sources may highly develop and consequently worsen reliability. This study enables us to draw three main conclusions: (i) electricity autonomy can be achieved thanks to high levels of biomass production and of intermittent sources; (ii) however, since fuel oil×³s power plants appear as back-up units, the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> power <b>supply</b> will be lowered.
