Currently, electricity production in Reunion Island is mainly based on imported fuels while it is blessed {{with high levels of}} renewable energy potentials.

The approach relies on a prospective study conducted by the TIMES-Reunion model which provides future production mixes according to different scenarios. It is combined with a quantitative assessment <b>of</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> power <b>supply</b> with two reliability indicators, regarding that intermittent sources may highly develop and consequently worsen reliability. This study enables us to draw three main conclusions: (i) electricity autonomy can be achieved thanks to high levels of biomass production and of intermittent sources; (ii) however, since fuel oil׳s power plants appear as back-up units, the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> power <b>supply</b> will be lowered.
