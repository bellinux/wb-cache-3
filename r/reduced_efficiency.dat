25|$|Neutral atoms or {{condensed}} matter cannot emit EUV radiation. Ionization must precede EUV emission in matter. The thermal {{production of}} multicharged positive ions is only {{possible in a}} hot dense plasma, which itself strongly absorbs EUV. As of 2016, the established EUV light source is a laser-pulsed Sn plasma. The ions absorb the EUV light they emit, and are easily neutralized by electrons in the plasma to lower charge states which produce light mainly at other, unusable wavelengths, which results in a much <b>reduced</b> <b>efficiency</b> of light generation for lithography at higher plasma power density.|$|E

However, Thomson et al. reported that Klf4 was unnecessary for generation of human iPS cells and in fact failed to generate human iPS cells. Klf2 and Klf4 {{were found to be}} factors capable of generating iPS cells, and related genes Klf1 and Klf5 did as well, although with <b>reduced</b> <b>efficiency.</b>|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{metabolic}} and homeostatic changes which result from untreated pain, including an increased requirement for oxygen, accompanied by a reduction in the efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs. This combination can lead to inadequate oxygen supply, resulting in potential hypoxemia. In addition, a rise in stomach acidity accompanies the stress reaction precipitated by pain, and there is a risk of aspirating this into the lungs, further endangering lung integrity and tissue oxygenation. In cases of acute, persistent pain, the metabolism becomes predominantly catabolic, causing <b>reduced</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the immune system and a breakdown of proteins caused by the action of the stress hormones. In combination, healing of damaged or infected tissue may be impaired, and morbidity and mortality increased.|$|E
500|$|CenturyLink Field {{has earned}} a {{reputation}} as one of the loudest stadiums in the NFL. It was, at one point in time, in the Guinness World Record books for being the loudest stadium in the world. The seating decks and partial roof, both trap and amplify exceptional amounts of noise and reflect it back onto the field. This noise possibly contributes to increased false start penalties since opposing offenses can miss audibles and the snap count, as well as delay of game penalties due to the <b>reduced</b> <b>efficiency</b> of communicating plays to the offense. From 2002 through 2012, there have been 143 false-start penalties on visiting teams in Seattle, second only to the Minnesota Vikings. During that same time period, the Seahawks have accumulated a home win record of 59-29, with a simultaneous road record of 33-55 ...|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Main, a {{well-known}} contemporary engineer, criticized the engines {{of the class}} as [...] "unusually heavy in all their parts", a common criticism of Isherwood's engines by private contractors. According to Main, the engines were fully 2.78 times heavier than required, leading to <b>reduced</b> <b>efficiency</b> and performance. Main notes that with a speed of only around 9 knots, the vessels were incapable of catching the faster blockade runners with speeds of 12 to 14 knots.

Limiting divisions to fourteen-day periods in the line, required a fresh division each day and the difficulty in finding the troops for this practice, led to German divisional reliefs becoming piecemeal, which <b>reduced</b> <b>efficiency</b> and brought the German armies on the Somme close to collapse.

40|$|This paper argues that, because {{governments are}} able to relax tax {{competition}} through public good differentiation, traditionally high-tax countries have continued to set taxes at a relatively high rate even as markets have become more integrated. The key assumption is that firms vary in {{the extent to which}} public good provision reduces costs. We show that Leviathan governments {{are able to}} use this fact to relax the forces of tax competition, <b>reducing</b> <b>efficiency.</b> When firms can ‘vote with their feet’ tax competition leads firms to locate in ‘too many’ jurisdictions.

25|$|When the {{pressure}} of the engine's intake air is increased, its temperature also increases. In addition, heat soak from the hot exhaust gases spinning the turbine will also heat the intake air. The warmer the intake air, the less dense, and the less oxygen available for the combustion event, which <b>reduces</b> volumetric <b>efficiency.</b> Not only does excessive intake-air temperature <b>reduce</b> <b>efficiency,</b> it also leads to engine knock, or detonation, which is destructive to engines.|$|R
