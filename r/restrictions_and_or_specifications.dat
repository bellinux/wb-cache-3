40|$|At a {{cellular}} level, nutrients are sensed by the mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR). The response of cells to hypoxia is regulated via {{action of the}} oxygen sensor Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 (HIF- 1).

Here we explore this question in vivo with respect to cell proliferation using the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) of Xenopus. We found that both nutrient-deprivation and hypoxia cause retinal progenitors to decrease their proliferation, yet when nutrient-deprived progenitors are exposed to hypoxia there is an unexpected rise in cell proliferation. This increase, mediated by HIF- 1 signalling, is dependent on glutaminolysis and reactivation of the mTOR pathway. We discuss how these findings in non-transformed tissue may also shed light on the ability of cancer cells in poorly vascularised solid tumours to proliferate...|$|R
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that nearly 100, 000 children are born into poverty each year in Canada. During pregnancy, their mothers are likely to face multiple stressful life events, including lone-mother and teenage pregnancies, unemployment, more crowded or polluted physical environments, and far fewer resources {{to deal with these}} exposures.

Poverty has consistently been found to be a powerful determinant of delayed cognitive development and poor school performance. Behaviour problems among young children and adolescents are strongly associated with maternal poverty. Sound evidence in support of policies and programs to reduce these disparities among the poor, including the role of health practitioners, is difficult to find. This is partly because many interventions and programs targeting the poor are not properly evaluated or critically appraised...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{a useful}} {{agent-based}} model and simulation typically involves acquiring {{knowledge of the}} model’s domain, developing the model itself, and then translating the model into software. This process can be complex and is an iterative one where changes in domain knowledge <b>and</b> model requirements <b>or</b> <b>specifications</b> can cause changes in the software that in turn may require additional modeling and domain knowledge. Test-driven development is a software development technique that can help ameliorate this complexity by evolving a loosely coupled flexible design, driven by the creation of many small, automated unit tests. When the focus shifts to writing small tests that exercise the simulations behavior, the larger problem of translating a conceptual model into working code is decomposed {{into a series of}} much smaller, more manageable and highly focused translations. This paper explores the application of this technique to agent-based simulation development with examples from Repast Simphony, ReLogo and Repast HPC. ...|$|R
40|$|Our software, Jest, {{comprises}} {{a general}} and extendible library for numerical optimization {{for science and}} engineering, Jam, and a particular extension of that framework for seismic image processing, Jag. Jest successfully separates optimization and application software without imposing limitations on an application's vector representation, on an application's operator implementation, or on a solver's ability to manipulate vectors and operators. To ensure the compatibility of solver and application, Jest includes a set of simple interfaces that define method invocations for the fundamental mathematical objects of numerical optimization, such as vectors, vector spaces, operators, and solvers. Jest's solvers are implemented in terms of these mathematical objects and consequently possess the generality of the original abstract mathematical algorithm. Jest's seismic imaging library, Jag, demonstrates that Jest incurs no <b>restrictions</b> <b>and</b> little <b>or</b> no programming overhead for scientific or engineering software packages.

Some experimental results for simulation checking of linear hybrid automata are provided using a prototype tool with exact arithmetic and unlimited digits. I...|$|R
