25|$|As {{part of its}} {{obligation}} {{under the}} Mount Laurel doctrine, the Council on Affordable Housing requires Marlboro Township to provide 1,673 low / moderate income housing units. The first two rounds of New Jersey's affordable housing regulations ran from 1987 to 1999. Under a <b>Regional</b> <b>Contribution</b> Agreement (RCA), Marlboro Township signed an agreement in June 2008 that would have Trenton build or rehabilitate 332 housing units, with Marlboro Township paying $25,000 per unit, a total of $8.3 million to Trenton for taking on the responsibility for these units. Under proposed legislation, municipalities may lose {{the ability to use}} these RCAs to pay other communities to accept their New Jersey COAH fair housing obligations, which would mean that Marlboro Township is now required to build the balance of housing. When the New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing requested plans to complete this obligation, Marlboro generated the largest number of objectors to an affordable housing plan in the history of New Jersey. Numerous appeals followed and in October 2010, the Appellate Division struck down portions of the 2007 regulations, invalidated the growth share methodology and directed COAH to develop new regulations. The NJ supreme court granted all petitions for certification in October 2010 and is set to hear the appeals. In June 2011, the Governor issued a reorganization plan which eliminated the 12-member COAH, though state courts overturned the governor's plan.|$|E

5000|$|COAH {{developed}} regulations {{under which}} the specific number of affordable units that each municipality {{would be required to}} provide (its “pre-credited need”) could be determined. Participating municipalities developed compliance plans to address this need by such means as the application of credits (e.g. filtering, spontaneous rehabilitation, extra credit for rental units), the use of <b>regional</b> <b>contribution</b> agreements (transferring part of the obligation to a willing municipality, usually an urban center, in the same region along with payment in an amount agreed by the municipalities) and zoning for affordable housing (usually involving increased density and mandatory set-asides).

Those municipalities that chose not to participate in COAH's administrative process remained vulnerable to exclusionary zoning lawsuits and the prospect of the builder's remedy. The disadvantage would be that a participating municipality might be required to zone some land in a manner that extra housing would be produced. Some municipalities, believing that the likelihood of facing an actual exclusionary zoning lawsuit was low enough, took their chances in not participating.|$|E

40|$|To {{characterize}} aerosol {{pollution in}} Beijing, size-resolved aerosols {{were collected by}} MOUDIs during CAREBEIJING- 2006 field campaign at Peking University (urban site) and Yufa (upwind rural site). Fine particle concentrations (PM 1. 8 by MOUDI) were 99. 8 ± 77. 4 μg/m 3 and 78. 2 ± 58. 4 μg/m 3, with PM 1. 8 /PM 10 ratios of 0. 64 ± 0. 08 and 0. 76 ± 0. 08 at PKU and Yufa, respectively, and secondary compounds {{accounted for more than}} 50 % in fine particles. PMF model analysis was used to resolve the particle modes. Three modes were resolved at Yufa, representing condensation, droplet and coarse mode. However, one more droplet mode with bigger size was resolved, which was considered probably from regional transport. Condensation mode accounted for 10 %– 60 % of the total mass at both sites, indicating that the gas-to-particle condensation process was important in summer. The formation of sulfate was mainly attributed to in-cloud or aerosol droplet process (PKU 80 %, Yufa 70 %) and gas condensation process (PKU 14 %, Yufa 22 %). According to the thermodynamic instability of NH 4 NO 3, size distributions of nitrate were classified as three categories by RH. The existence of Ca(NO 3) 2 in droplet mode indicated the reaction of HNO 3 with crustal particles was also important in fine particles. A rough estimation was given that 69 % of the PM 10 and 87 % of the PM 1. 8 in Beijing urban were <b>regional</b> <b>contributions.</b> Sulfate, ammonium and oxalate were formed regionally, with the <b>regional</b> <b>contributions</b> of 90 %, 87 % and 95 % to PM 1. 8.

40|$|International audienceWe have re-assessed the Sr isotopic {{budget of}} the modern ocean {{taking into account the}} high erosion rates of {{volcanic}} islands, and especially of island arcs, emphasizing important contribution from subsurface weathering to global budgeting. We propose that intensive weathering on volcanic islands, island arcs and oceanic islands, coupled with large surface and subsurface water fluxes is the missing source of mantlederived 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0. 703) in seawater Sr isotope balance. In our approach, it represents 60 % of the actual mantle-like input of Sr to the oceans, the remaining 40 % supplied by ridge-crest hydrothermal activity and sea-floor low-temperature alteration of basalts. The seawater Nd isotopic budget is consistent with this interpretation and explains well the <b>regional</b> <b>contributions</b> from ridge crest and island arc activity among the oceans...|$|R
