5|$|Landsat 1 had two {{sensors to}} achieve its primary objectives: the <b>return</b> <b>beam</b> <b>vidicon</b> (RBV) and the {{multispectral}} scanner (MSS).|$|E
5|$|From launch until 1974, Landsat 1 {{transmitted}} over 100,000 images, which covered {{more than}} 75% of the Earth's surface. The {{majority of these}} images were taken with the multispectral scanner. On 05 August 1972 the <b>return</b> <b>beam</b> <b>vidicon</b> failed after taking only 1690 images.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the case}} of its {{predecessor}} Landsat 1, the satellite's payload included two remote sensing instruments, the <b>Return</b> <b>Beam</b> <b>Vidicon</b> (RBV) and the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS). The specifications for these instruments were identical to those of the instruments carried on Landsat 1. The data acquired by the MSS was considered more scientifically useful than the data returned from the RBV, which was rarely used and considered only for engineering evaluation purposes.|$|E
40|$|Satellite {{remote sensing}} {{technology}} is overviewed with {{particular emphasis on}} the present and planned LANDSAT satellite systems.

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, the use of both {{photographic}} and non-photographic remote sensing from satellite platforms has provided a unique capability for the observation and study of Earth and planetary surfaces. A wide range of imaging sensors that operate in different portions {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} have yielded images of large areas that formerly were unknown or that had not previously been observed at a simultaneous instant in time. In addition, remote sensors equipped with multispectral or multiband capabilities are capable of taking data at different wavelengths simultaneously. Notable examples include the LANDSAT series of multispectral scanners, thematic mappers, and <b>return</b> <b>beam</b> <b>vidicons.</b> Synthetic aperture radar and LANDSAT imagery are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} observations {{of plant and}} soil reflectance spectra were made to {{develop an understanding of}} the reflectance of solar energy by plants and soils. A related objective is the isolation of factors contributing to the image formed by multispectral scanners and <b>return</b> <b>beam</b> <b>vidicons</b> carried by ERTS or film-filter combinations used in the field or on aircraft. A set of objective criteria are to be developed for identifying plant and soil types and their changing condition through the seasons for application of space imagery to resource management. This is because the global scale of earth observations satellites requires objective rather than subjective techniques, particularly where ground truth is either not available or too costly to acquire. As the acquiring of ground truth for training sets may be impractical in many cases, {{attempts have been made to}} identify objectively standard responses which could be used for image interpretation...|$|R
500|$|Landsat 2 is {{the second}} {{satellite}} of the Landsat program. The spacecraft originally carried a designation of ERTS-B (Earth Resource Technology Satellite B) but was renamed [...] "Landsat 2" [...] prior to its launch on January 22, 1975. The objective of the satellite was to acquire global, seasonal data in medium resolution from a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit. The satellite, built by General Electric, acquired data with the <b>Return</b> <b>Beam</b> <b>Vidicon</b> (RBV) and the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS). Despite having a design life of one year, Landsat 2 operated for over seven years, finally ceasing operations on February 25, 1982.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the Galileo probe to Jupiter in the late 1970s to early 1980s, NASA used Vidicon cameras on nearly all the unmanned deep space probes equipped with the remote sensing ability.

50|$|Ground speed radar is a non-mechanical way of {{measuring}} {{the speed of}} a vehicle.The Speed sensor fires a radar beam towards the ground and measures the Doppler shift of the <b>returning</b> <b>beam.</b> This information is then sent to the engine control unit which calculates the forward speed.|$|R

Instead, target alters light beam reflected from itself back to interrogating station in unique way.

50|$|The <b>Return</b> <b>Beam</b> <b>Vidicon</b> (RBV) was {{designed}} at RCA in Princeton, New Jersey. It contained two cameras {{to cover the}} 0.53 to 0.75 micrometer spectral band. The cameras were structurally isolated from the satellite {{so that they could}} maintain their alignment. Each camera was triggered every 12.5 seconds so that the images would overlap in the direction the spacecraft was moving. The cameras each had a 98 km square viewing range, and combined the range was 185 km. The cameras contained an optical lens, RBV sensor, thermoelectric cooler, deflection and focus coils, a mechanical shutter, and erase lamps. Landsat 3 RBV had a resolution of 40 m, which was twice the resolution of Landsat 1's 80 m.|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} data {{acquisition}} and data analysis {{is described in}} which the performance of Michelson-type interferometers with unequal arms can be made nearly the same as interferometers with equal arms.

50|$|A Michelson {{interferometer}} consists minimally {{of mirrors}} M1 & M2 and {{a beam splitter}} M.In Fig 2, a source S emits light that hits the beam splitter (in this case, a plate beamsplitter) surface M at point C. M is partially reflective, so part of the light is transmitted through to point B while some {{is reflected in the}} direction of A. Both beams recombine at point C' to produce an interference pattern incident on the detector at point E (or on the retina of a person's eye). If there is a slight angle between the two <b>returning</b> <b>beams,</b> for instance, then an imaging detector will record a sinusoidal fringe pattern as shown in Fig. 3b. If there is perfect spatial alignment between the <b>returning</b> <b>beams,</b> then there will not be any such pattern but rather a constant intensity over the beam dependent on the differential pathlength; this is difficult, requiring very precise control of the beam paths.|$|R
40|$|An {{optical sensor}} {{such as a}} laser range finder (LRF) or laser {{displacement}} meter (LDM) uses reflected and <b>returned</b> laser <b>beam</b> from a target. The optical sensor has been mainly {{used to measure the}} distance between a launch position and the target. However, optical sensor based LRF and LDM have numerous and various errors such as statistical errors, drift errors, cyclic errors, alignment errors and slope errors. Among these errors, an alignment error that contains measurement error for the strength of radiation of <b>returned</b> laser <b>beam</b> from the target is the most serious error in industrial optical sensors. It is caused by the dependence of the measurement offset upon the strength of radiation of <b>returned</b> <b>beam</b> incident upon the focusing lens from the target. In this paper, in order to solve these problems, we propose a novel method for the measurement of the output of direct current (DC) voltage that is proportional to the strength of radiation of <b>returned</b> laser <b>beam</b> in the received avalanche photo diode (APD) circuit. We implemented a measuring circuit that is able to provide an exact measurement of reflected laser beam. By using the proposed method, we can measure the intensity or strength of radiation of laser beam in real time and {{with a high degree of}} precision...|$|R
