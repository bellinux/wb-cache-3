5|$|Concepts {{related to}} force include: thrust, which {{increases}} the velocity of an object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque, which produces changes in <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. Such internal mechanical stresses cause no accelation of that body as the forces balance one another. Pressure, the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate. Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or flow in fluids.|$|E
5|$|The project {{suffered}} a setback on 12 March 1969, when the rotor on prototype #3 (s/n 66-8828) struck the fuselage and caused the aircraft to crash, killing the pilot, David A. Beil. The accident occurred {{on a test}} flight where the pilot was to manipulate the controls to excite 0.5P oscillations (or half-P hop) in the rotor; 0.5P is a vibration that happens once per two main rotor revolutions, where P is the rotor's <b>rotational</b> <b>speed.</b> The accident investigation noted that safety mechanisms on the controls had apparently been disabled for the flight. The investigation concluded that the pilot-induced oscillations {{had set up a}} resonant vibration that exceeded the rotor system's ability to compensate. After the investigation, the rotor and control systems were modified to prevent the same problem from occurring again.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E

Experiments were performed on an array of four rotors placed in a two-dimensional (2 -D) wave channel. The flow around the rotors was documented using particle image velocimetry measurements. The submergence of the rotors and {{the distance between them}} were varied, and the <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> of the rotors (Nn) were recorded at different wave frequencies.

25|$|HDD data {{transfer}} rate depends upon the <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> of the platters and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit <b>rotational</b> <b>speed,</b> advancing density becomes the main method to improve sequential transfer rates.

While areal density advances by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk {{and the number of}} sectors per track, only the latter increases the {{data transfer}} rate for a given rpm. Since {{data transfer rate}} performance tracks only one of the two components of areal density, its performance improves at a lower rate.|$|E

At least one manufacturer in the early 1920s, World Records, produced records that played at a constant linear velocity, controlled by Noel Pemberton Billing's patented add-on governor device. As these were played from the outside to the inside, the <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> of the records increased as reproduction progressed.

25|$|A {{gas turbine}} offers some {{advantages}} over a piston engine. There are few moving parts, decreasing {{the need for}} lubrication and potentially reducing maintenance costs, and the power-to-weight ratio is much higher. A turbine of a given power output is also physically smaller than an equally powerful piston engine, allowing a locomotive to be very powerful without being inordinately large. However, a turbine's power output and efficiency both drop dramatically with <b>rotational</b> <b>speed,</b> unlike a piston engine, which has a comparatively flat power curve. This makes GTEL systems useful primarily for long-distance high-speed runs.|$|E
25|$|Torque can {{be defined}} as the rate of change of angular momentum, {{analogous}} to force. The conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena, for example the increase in <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> of a spinning figure skater as the skater's arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of neutron stars, the falling cat problem, and precession of tops and gyros. Applications include the gyrocompass, control moment gyroscope, inertial guidance systems, reaction wheels, flying discs or Frisbees and Earth's rotation to name a few. In general, conservation does limit the possible motion of a system, but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is.|$|E

While visiting at the Physics Hall of Qau, Alam met with Tasnim Shah, a professor of mathematics at Qau. Alam introduced Shah with KRL scientists where they examined the problems. It was followed by forming Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Division. The CFD Division analyzed {{the problems of the}} SWU — measuring the amount of work done by the centrifuge, and Centrifugal acceleration — how many rpm would a machine covered, and Rotational dynamics — what would be its appropriate <b>rotational</b> <b>speed.</b> Tasneem Shah gained fame when he independently analysed the issue, and assisted the KRL scientists to develop a powerful version of the centrifuges.|$|E

The rotating enclosure {{is filled with}} water-Ag, water-Cu, water-Al 2 O 3, or water-TiO 2 nanofluids. The governing equations are in velocity, pressure, and temperature formulation and solved using the staggered grid arrangement together with MAC method. The governing parameters considered are the solid volume fraction, 0. 0  ≤ ϕ ≤  0. 05, and the <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds,</b> 3. 5 ≤ Ω ≤  17. 5 [*]rpm, and the centrifugal force is smaller than the Coriolis force and both forces were kept below the buoyancy force. It is found that the angular locations of the local maximums heat transfer were sensitive to <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> and nanoparticles concentration. The global quantity of heat transfer rate increases about 1. 5 %, 1. 1 %, 0. 8 %, and 0. 6 % by increasing 1 % ϕ of the nanoparticles Ag, Cu, Al 2 O 3, and TiO 2, respectively, for the considered <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds...</b>|$|R
25|$|From 1949 to 1953, Clement's {{first three}} novels were two-, three-, and four-part Astounding serials under Campbell: Needle (Doubleday, 1950), Iceworld (Gnome Press, 1953), and Mission of Gravity (1954), his best-known novel, {{published}} by Doubleday's Science Fiction Book Club (established 1953). The latter novel features a {{land and sea}} expedition across the superjovian planet Mesklin to recover a stranded scientific probe. The natives of Mesklin are centipede-like intelligent beings about 50 centimeters long. Various episodes hinge {{on the fact that}} Mesklin's fast <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> causes it to be considerably deformed from the spherical, with effective surface gravity that varies from approximately 3 gn at the equator to approximately 700 gn at the poles.|$|E
25|$|Typically ABS {{includes}} a central {{electronic control unit}} (ECU), four wheel speed sensors, {{and at least two}} hydraulic valves within the brake hydraulics. The ECU constantly monitors the <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> of each wheel; if it detects the wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, a condition indicative of impending wheel lock, it actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the affected wheel, thus reducing the braking force on that wheel; the wheel then turns faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel is increased so the braking force is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply or release braking pressure 15 times per second. Because of this, the wheels of cars equipped with ABS are practically impossible to lock even during panic braking in extreme conditions.|$|E
