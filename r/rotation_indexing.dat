For example, as the A type crops one may specify the lightly irrigated cultures, and as the B type the more heavily irrigated ones, such as sugarcane and rice. But one can also take A as rice and B as sugarcane, or perhaps trees and orchards. The A, B and/or U crops can be taken differently in different seasons, e.g. A=wheat+barley in winter and A=maize in summer while B=vegetables in winter and B=cotton in summer. [...] Un-irrigated land can be specified in two ways: (1) as U=1&minus;A&minus;B and (2) as A and/or B with zero irrigation. A combination can also be made. Further, a specification must be given of the seasonal rotation of the different land uses over the total area, e.g. full rotation, no rotation at all, or incomplete rotation. This occurs with a <b>rotation</b> <b>index.</b> The <b>rotations</b> are taken over the seasons within the year. To obtain rotations over the years it is advisable to introduce annual input changes. When a fraction A1, B1 and/or U1 in the first season differs from fractions are A2, B2 and/or U2 in the second season, because the irrigation regimes in the seasons differ, the program will detect that a certain rotation occurs. If one wishes to avoid this, one may specify the same fractions in all seasons (A2=A1, B2=B1, U2=U1), but the crops and irrigation quantities {{may have to be}} adjusted in proportion.

The main feature of our approach is the symmetric reversibility, which means that when using the same algorithm for the converse operation, then the initial data is recovered exactly. To that purpose, we decompose the lattice conversion process into (at most) three successive shear operations. The translations along the shear directions are implemented by 1 -D fractional delay operators, which revert to simple 1 -D convolutions, with appro-priate filters that yield the property of symmetric reversibility.

The integration of the LLG equation yields that the reversal process changes slowly and steadily from coherent rotation to nucleation with increasing column length. The region between homogeneous rotation and nucleation becomes smaller and is shifted to smaller column lengths if the damping constant is reduced from = 1 to = 0 02. In the weakly damped case very fast switching modes exist if the switching field is only slightly larger than the coercive field. In this small regime the switching time increases with higher switching fields. Using solutions of LLG simulations, energy barriers between the two stable states at zero field are estimated. For column lengths larger than 30 nm the energy barrier for inhomogeneous reversal processes are smaller than for coherent <b>rotation.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Energy barriers, fast switching, micromagnetics, perpendicular recording, thermal stability.

40|$|Abstract—The third Stokes {{parameter}} {{of ocean}} surface bright-ness temperatures {{measured by the}} WindSat instrument is sensi-tive to the rotation angle between the polarization vectors at the ocean surface and the instrument. This rotation angle depends on the spacecraft attitude (roll, pitch, yaw) {{as well as the}} Faraday ro-tation of the electromagnetic radiation passing through the Earth’s ionosphere. Analyzing the WindSat antenna temperatures, we find biases in the third Stokes parameter as function of the along-scan position of up to 1. 5 K in all feedhorns. This points to a misspec-ification of the reported spacecraft attitude. A single attitude cor-rection of 0 16 roll and 0. 18 pitch for the whole instrument eliminates all the biases.

However, when the data sets from different clocking positions are combined, phase errors are introduced due to the inability to precisely align the time history sequences.
