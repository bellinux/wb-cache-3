40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{a recent}} decision of 25 February 2014 {{issued by the}} European Court of Human Rights in the Avotiņš v. Latvia case (application no. 17502 / 07), now pending before the Grand Chamber, pursuant to Article 43, para. 1, of the European Convention of Human Rights (hereinafter: ECHR). In the above case the Court excluded that the Latvian courts, by ordering the enforcement of a Cypriot judgment rendered in absentia and subject to Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of decisions in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I Regulation), have infringed Article 6, para. 1, of the ECHR, concerning {{the right to a}} fair trial. The article criticizes the assessment of the Strasbourg Court on the control performed by the requested Member State over the protection of the guarantees enshrined in Article 6, para. 1, of the Convention. In particular, it stresses that the judgment seems to have failed to comply with the Pellegrini v. Italy’s test in assessing the ‘indirect’ or par ricochet protection of the ECHR. Moreover, the paper points out that the Latvian courts have not properly verified the effective respect of the defendant’s right to a fair trial in absentia, according to the interpretation of the ground for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> and enforcement of decisions provided for by Article 34, para. 2, of the Brussels I Regulation.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} of European Private International Law (EPIL) have considerably enhanced {{the principle of}} mutual recognition {{in the framework of}} judicial cooperation in civil matters. With regard to the free movement of judicial and extrajudicial judgments, the general guidelines provided by the Tampere and Stockholm programmes have been pursued under two different directions. On the one hand, mutual recognition has been achieved by a partial or complete harmonization of procedural law (Regulation No 1896 / 2006 creating a European order for payment procedure; Regulation No 861 / 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure). On the other hand, mutual recognition has entailed a gradual abolition of all intermediate measures or proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of civil judgments issued by Member States (Regulation No 805 / 2004 on the European enforcement order for uncontested claims, and, partially, Regulation No 4 / 2009 on cross-border maintenance obligations). More recently, Regulation No 1215 / 2012 (Brussels I-bis) has provided for the direct enforcement of judgments given in another Member State without a declaration of enforceability (abolition of exequatur). Nevertheless, under some of these instruments there remain limits to mutual recognition. For instance, under Brussels I-bis, the person against whom enforcement is sought may apply for refusal of the recognition or enforcement of a judgment if he considers that one of the grounds for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> (e. g. public policy) is present. It is also possible to invoke the grounds for refusal available under the national law of the Member State of enforcement. The main purpose of the paper is to provide a coherent and comprehensive framework of the expansion of the principle of mutual recognition in EPIL instruments. It will then review the challenges posed by the (potential) extension of the principle on other sensitive areas of law, such as family matters and civil status documents...|$|E
40|$|The subject. This informational {{article is}} devoted to the peculiarities of {{recognition}} and enforcement of international commercial arbitration awards according to different countries’ legislation and international legal regulation. The purpose of the article is to identify legal patterns of recognition and enforcement of international commercial arbitration awards in different countries. Methodology. The study is based on comparative law and formal law methods, analysis and synthesis. Results, scope of application. Enforcement of arbitral awards in foreign countries is ensured and guaranteed by multilateral conventions, bilateral treaties and national legislation. The New York Convention 1958 in a certain way limits the scope of legal protection of arbitral awards and leaves the procedure for recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards for consideration of the state court. The author analyses of differentiation of the recognition and enforcement regime of so-called "domestic" and "foreign" solutions of international commercial arbitration in terms of doctrinal approaches and practice of foreign countries. Special attention is given to the analysis of foreign arbitral awards of recognition and enforcement procedures is given to a denial of recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards and their reasons. In spite of the explicit grounds for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in New York Convention 1958, some countries try to establish certain exceptions to the rule in the national legislation. Results may be applicable in improvement of international legal regulation. Conclusions. The courts of the countries – participants of the New York Convention 1958 cannot cancel the foreign arbitral award or revise it substantially. The refutation of this award is possible only in the court of the state in whose territory the relevant arbitral award was made, and such court is not formally bound by the rules of the New York Convention 1958, when deciding whether to cancel or modify the award. </p...|$|E
40|$|International {{arbitration}} is {{an integral}} element of the globalized modern economy. It is the principal method of resolving commercial disputes between States, individuals, and corporations in {{almost every aspect of}} international trade. Arbitration relies on the notion of party autonomy—that the parties to an agreement may freely choose the law applicable to their agreement and to the resolution of any dispute arising out of it. However, agreements have to be performed and arbitral awards rendered somewhere, and in the modern world in which the preeminent legal authority is the sovereign State, these actions necessarily occur under a legal framework and a public policy not shaped by the parties. When rules of public policy are implicated in the agreement underlying a dispute in arbitration—or in the award resulting from the for arbitration proceedings, a State must navigate between the Scylla and Charybdis of lending its authority to the recognition of an agreement or enforcement of an award contrary to its fundamental principles or of appearing not to respect the principle of finality of arbitral awards underpinning the system of modern international commerce. What route should national courts—the “watchmen of public policy”—choose? Should party autonomy cabined by respect for international public policy? Or should public policy be viewed as a safety valve utilized only in emergencies, where recognition and enforcement would be fundamentally at odds with a State’s most cherished principles and values? This thesis details the provisions for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> or enforcement of arbitral awards on the grounds of public policy that currently exist in major international conventions and model legislation {{as well as in the}} legislation of the United States and selected European Union Member States. The various ways in which public policy can be understood is explained, and the application of the public policy exceptions in the United States and selected European Union Member States are detailed. Finally, trends in the United States and the European Union with respect to public policy and arbitration are examined...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explains}} {{the prospect of}} Kosovo in the EU, and the challenges that Kosovo is facing during this process. Kosovo is the last country in the Western Balkans, {{which is in the}} early stage of the accession process, respectively Stabilization and Association Process. This process was not an easy one for Kosovo. The optimism of Kosovo in being part of the EU brought many challenges, which initially were related to the unresolved political status of the country. Kosovo was deprived for a long period from the Stabilization and Association Process and its agreement. With the declaration of independence, on February 17 th, 2008, and the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> five EU member states to recognize the independence, Kosovo continues to hamper the normal development of Kosovo in the European integration process. This paper analyzes the challenges that Kosovo has faced in the past related to this process, and its future challenges in the process of EU membership. This article also treats the issue of the footnote, used as a reference to Kosovo by the European Union. This fact is evidence that EU member states have an irreplaceable role within the Union, regarding the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> new states and their acceptance in the accession process. The EU as a “supranational organization” since its creation is being developed and changed, and the events, which have occurred recently, such as the failure to adopt the EU constitution, the referendum held for the exit of the UK from the European Union, are signals for the need for necessary changes in the reformation of the EU. The signing of the SAA with specific conditions, does not guarantee that the process of obtaining the status of candidate for EU membership will pass without difficulties, due to the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> the independence of Kosovo by five member states.

40|$|Esta tese tem por objetivo explorar a teoria do reconhecimento sob o paradigma da psicanálise castoriadiana para transpô-la para o nível microssocial das organizações de trabalho. Esse objetivo foi construído como um passo para a compreensão das experiências emocionais geradas por padrões de reconhecimento intersubjetivo nas organizações de trabalho contemporâneas e sua realização foi apoiada em dados empíricos. A pesquisa empírica utilizou uma amostra de cinquenta processos trabalhistas, nos quais o reconhecimento em organizações foi identificado e analisado na sua forma negativa, ou seja, a recusa ao reconhecimento. Os padrões de recusa foram identificados por meio de práticas e significados gerados por diversos sujeitos dos territórios organizacionais. Quatro tipos de causa apareceram nas ações dos sujeitos: reprodução das formas macrossociais de desigualdade, obsessões sexuais em relações assimétricas de poder, vingança pessoal e três categorias de ação {{instrumental}} gerencial: gestão do corpo, gestão da subjetividade e gestão dos rendimentos. Quatro tendências surgiram no desdobramento temporal da recusa ao reconhecimento: acirramento quantitativo (as ações dirigidas ao mesmo trabalhador ficam mais frequentes), acirramento qualitativo (as ações dirigidas ao mesmo trabalhador ficam mais intensas), disseminação (cada vez mais sujeitos passam a promover ações dirigidas ao mesmo trabalhador) e aumento da complexidade (distintas categorias de ação são dirigidas ao mesmo trabalhador). Contudo, os dados demonstram que os diversos sujeitos significam diferenciadamente as mesmas ações. Os que são alvos das ações as significam como uma experiência de vitimização individual, os que as promovem as significam como algo banal, enquanto que os colegas de trabalho e clientes oscilam entre essas duas tendências e, não raramente, reagem com humor. As experiências emocionais subjacentes a essas ações, tais como vergonha, tristeza, medo e raiva, foram identificadas e conectadas aos padrões organizacionais de reconhecimento. As relações reveladas entre elas sugere que: (1) os padrões causais predispõem à prevalência de emoções distintas para cada categoria; (2) os padrões temporais tornam a experiência emocional mais intensa e complexa e; (3) os padrões de significação predispõem os trabalhadores a, consecutivamente, desconexão emocional, dissonância emocional e isolamento emocionalThis thesis aims {{exploring the}} theory of recognition through the paradigm of Castoriadian psychoanalysis and transposing the resulting conceptual framework to the micro-level of work organizations. That objective was drawn as a step {{to the development of}} the understanding of underlying emotional experiences which stem from the patterns of intersubjective recognition in contemporary work organizations and was achieved and supported by empirical data. The research was carried out with a sample of fifty labor courts lawsuits through which organizational recognition patterns were gathered and scrutinized in a negative way, i. e., from the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition.</b> The patterns of the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> were unfolded by the practices and meanings produced by the various subjects comprised in organizational territories. Several outcomes emerged from that analysis. Four kinds of causes came up in the actions of those subjects: the reproduction of social forms of inequality, sexual obsessions in asymmetrical power relationships, personal revenge and three subcategories of instrumental managerial action: body management, subjectivity management and earnings management. Four trends were identified in the temporal unfolding of the refusal of recognition: quantitative intensification (actions directed to the same employee became more frequent), qualitative intensification (actions directed to the same employee became more intense), dissemination (more subjects promote actions directed to the same employee) and complexity (actions from different causal categories were directed to the same employee). Yet, the findings pointed out that distinct subjects interpret those actions differently. Those who are the targets of the actions interpret them as a personal victimization experiences, whereas those who promote those actions interpret them as something banal; inasmuch as the coworkers and costumers who witness or promote them oscillate between these two trends and often give them a humorous sense. The emotional experiences underlying these actions such as shame, sadness, fear and anger were identified and related to the patterns of organizational recognition. The relationships found between them suggested that: (1) the causal patterns predispose the prevalence of different emotions for each category, (2) the temporal patterns makes emotional experiences more intense and complex; and (3) the meaning patterns predispose employees to, consecutively, emotional disconnection, emotional dissonance and emotional isolatio...|$|E

U trećem, središnjem dijelu rada razmatraju se dva načina priznanja koja Uredba Bruxelles I predviđa: automatsko priznanje, priznanje u posebnom postupku u kojem je utvrđenje da je strana odluka podobna za priznanje glavni predmet tog postupka, te odlučivanje o priznanju kao o prethodnom pitanju unutar jednog postupka. U okviru tog dijela rada obrazlaže se i institut djelomičnog priznanja. Predmet četvrtog dijela rada jest institut prekida postupka priznanja. The subject-matter of {{the paper}} is the concept of “recognition“ of foreign judgments and the procedure for the recognition of foreign judgments under Regulation (EC) No. 44 / 2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I Regulation), the most important legal source of procedural private international law of the European Union. After the introductory part, the second part {{of the paper}} comments on the concept of “recognition“ under the Brussels I Regulation, firstly on general issues with regard to recognition: legal theories on recognition, irrelevance of recognition in a third country, the requirement that legal effects of a judgment must have arisen in the state of origin, the scope of recognition, the text (wording) in which the judgment is recognized, the moment in time when recognition is decided upon and the period of the time of the recognition. Thereafter, the limits of authority enjoyed by a judgment in the State of recognition pursuant to a principle of extension of a judgment’s effects from a State of origin into a State of recognition are analysed: effect of finality of a judgment as to its substance (materiellrechtliche Rechtskräftigkeit), estoppel effect (Präklusionswirkung), constitutive effect (Gestalltungswirkung), procedural effect towards third persons, foreign judgment as a legally relevant fact, burden of proof and enforceability. In the third part of the paper, which represents the most essential part, three forms of recognition foreseen by the Brussels I Regulation, are analysed: automatic recognition, recognition in a declaratory proceedings, and recognition as an incidental issue within the framework of other proceedings. The principle of automatic recognition, as accepted by the Regulation, provides that judgments issued in one Member State are automatically recognized in other Member States without any prior proceedings or formal steps. It represents one of the pillars on which the European judicial area is based and directly contributes to “rapid and simple recognition and enforcement“ accepted as a main goal of the Regulation pursuant to Recital 2 of its Preamble. With regard to the recognition procedure in which the main issue is the determination as to whether a foreign decision is capable of being recognised, the notions “interested party” and “dispute” are considered as well as the possibility of only initiating the procedure for a positive and not a negative declaration and. It is emphasised that the special procedure for recognition can be initiated independently as well as together with a request for the declaration of enforceability of the foreign judgment. Further, the effect of annulment or amendment of the decision in the State of origin on the recognition procedure and the legal nature of the decision on the declaration of recognition is discussed. Regarding recognition as an incidental issue, the difference in terminology of several languages of the Regulation is emphasised, the scope of application of the respective provision is analysed, the court’s authority for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> is considered and the mutatis mutandis application of rules of Sections 2 and 3 of the Chapter III of the Regulation. Within this part of the paper, the partial recognition of a foreign judgment is also explained. The fourth part of the paper considers stay of proceedings, especially the reasons for a stay and it is determined that a stay only relates to the prejudicial recognition procedure. In addition, the notion of the “regular legal remedy“ is explained, the discretionary power of the court to stay the proceedings is analysed and a special rule for Ireland and the United Kingdom is explained...|$|E
40|$|O objeto {{principal}} da dissertação é a análise do regime jurídico da exclusão de sócios nas sociedades limitadas, nos termos do Código Civil de 2002 (Lei Federal n° 10. 406 / 02). Parte-se de um exame do percurso histórico de afirmação do instituto, entrelaçado com uma visão panorâmica da disciplina atual da matéria em alguns dos ordenamentos que mais influenciaram o Direito brasileiro, com destaque para Alemanha, França e, sobretudo, Itália. Em relação à experiência brasileira anterior à promulgação do Código Civil de 2002, o estudo concentra-se em demonstrar o caráter eminentemente doutrinário e jurisprudencial da consolidação do instituto. De fato, sempre sob a vigência do Código Comercial de 1850, à margem de quaisquer mudanças legislativas de maior relevo, a possibilidade de exclusão de sócios foi primeiramente recusada, para paulatinamente ser aceita e, finalmente, ser aplicada com exagerada liberalidade. Conceitualmente, a exclusão é enquadrada como uma expressão da especialidade da sociedade, enquanto contrato plurilateral. A exclusão facultativa, em particular - em oposição à exclusão de pleno direito -, é vista como manifestação peculiar da resolução contratual por inadimplemento. O estudo compreende uma análise crítica das disposições do Código Civil de 2002 em matéria societária, além de uma investigação das causas e procedimentos de exclusão sob a vigência de tal diploma. As principais teses defendidas no trabalho são: (i) a diferença estrutural entre a exclusão facultativa, objeto tradicional de estudo da doutrina brasileira, e a exclusão de pleno direito - novidade introduzida no ordenamento brasileiro por inspiração direta da lei italiana -; (ii) deficiência e inadequação da teoria do rompimento da affectio societatis como justa causa para a exclusão; (iii) a duplicidade de procedimentos para a exclusão facultativa, relativamente à sociedade limitada, com o convívio dos procedimentos de exclusão judicial e extrajudicial; (iv) a impossibilidade de se equiparar a assembléia ou reunião de exclusão a julgamento, recusando-se a atribuição de um verdadeiro d̈ireito de defesaäo sócio que se deseja excluir. The {{main purpose}} of the essay is to review the legal discipline of the exclusion of a partner from a limited liability company under {{the provisions of the}} Civil Code of 2002 (Federal Law n. 10406 / 02). The analysis starts with a review of the historical development of the right of exclusion, combined with an overview of the current legal treatment of the issue in a number of jurisdictions that exercised the most relevant influence on Brazilian Law; in particular Germany, France and - above all- Italy. On what regards Brazilian experience prior to the enactment of the Civil Code of 2002, the analysis focuses on illustrating how the development of the right exclusion was mostly based on academic studies and case law. As a matter of fact, under the provisions of the Commercial Code 1850, in spite of the lack of any relevant reforms on statutory legislation, the possibility of exclusion of partner was, at first, rejected and then, gradually accepted. At a later phase, exclusion was even applied without due control. Conceptually, the exclusion of a partner is classified as an expression of the special nature of the company as a plurilateral agreement. In particular, optional exclusion - unlike mandatory exclusion - is seen as a special form of contract termination due to material breach. The research comprehends a critical review of the provisions of the Civil Code of 2002 on corporate law, in addition to an analysis of relevant causes and procedures for the exclusion of a partner under said law. The main theses defended are the following: (i) existence of structural differences between optional exclusion - traditional object of study by Brazilian academics - and mandatory exclusion - a new procedure introduced {{as a result of the}} direct Italian influence on Brazilian law -, (ii) problems and inadequacy of the theory of rupture of affectio societatis as a cause for exclusion, (iii) existence of two parallel procedures for the optional exclusion of a partner within limited liability companies, one being through a court ruling and the other trough corporate a mere resolution; (iv) impossibility of treating the exclusion through corporate resolution as a form of judgment and, thus, the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> of a r̈ight of defenseïn favor of the partner that is to be excluded...|$|E

40|$|The Brussels I Regulation ((EU) No 1215 / 2010) {{governs the}} {{division}} of jurisdiction between the Member States of the European Union and provides for the circulation of judgments within the Member States in civil and commercial matters. Arbitration is excluded from {{the scope of the}} Regulation, and the Regulation should not affect the application of the New York Convention in the Member States. The arbitration exclusion reflects a traditional understanding that the systems of international civil procedure and international arbitration are expected to function autonomously. Despite this, the two systems occasionally collide as parties to a dispute attempt to initiate parallel court and arbitral proceedings. Further, if parallel court and arbitral proceedings on the same matter and between the same parties cannot be prevented, they may result in two at least partially overlapping and conflicting decisions. This study concerns first whether parallel court and arbitral proceedings can be prevented in ways that are compatible with the Regulation and the New York Convention. The second research question concerns on which grounds a Member State court is able to refuse recognition and enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment that conflicts with an arbitral award. The study is based on doctrinal research, and the objectives of the study are twofold. First, the study examines the prevailing interpretation of the Regulation’s interface with arbitration and secondly, the study aims at presenting a recommendation regarding the application of the Regulation in case a Member State court is requested to enforce a judgment conflicting with an arbitral award. Regarding the first research question, the study examines the availability of measures restricting or discouraging parallel court and arbitral proceedings. The prohibition of court-ordered anti-suit injunctions established in the case-law of the CJEU under the old Brussels I Regulation ((EC) No 44 / 2001) remains applicable under the recast Regulation. Further, the assessment of whether Member State courts are permitted to order damages for breach of arbitration agreement appears to give a negative answer as such damages are argued to be contrary to the principle of mutual trust between Member State courts. On the contrary, the recognition and enforcement of anti-suit injunctions ordered by arbitrators and arbitral awards ordering damages for breach of arbitration agreement appear to be outside the scope of the Regulation but national laws of the Member States strongly limit the availability and enforceability of such measures. This leads to a conclusion that parallel court and arbitral proceedings cannot be effectively prevented under the Regulation. As a main rule, the decision which is rendered first is to be recognised and enforced in other Member States on the application of a party regardless of any pending parallel proceedings. The Regulation particularly prescribes that it shall not affect the application of the New York Convention, which has led to a discussion concerning the possibility of anti-enforcement injunctions directed against the enforcement of a judgment that has been rendered prior to an arbitral award on the same matter and between the same parties. Such injunctions appear, however, both incompatible with the Regulation and unnecessary with regard to the unaffected application of the New York Convention. If a Brussels I regime judgment has been given first, it can be enforced in accordance with the Regulation. The same applies to an arbitral award under the New York Convention if the recognition and enforcement of the award is sought first. The Regulation does not address on which grounds a Member State court may refuse the enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment in case the enforcement is requested only after a conflicting arbitral award is recognised and enforced in the Member State addressed. It appears clear that the enforcement must be refused in such situation but, on the other hand, the grounds for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> and enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment are exhaustively listed in the Regulation. The study discusses four alternative grounds for refusing the enforcement. It is concluded that the enforcement of a conflicting Brussels I regime judgment should be refused on the grounds of being contrary to the public policy in the Member State addressed since the national public policy cannot accommodate recognition and enforcement of two irreconcilable decisions...|$|E
