40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{describe}} {{experiments in the}} application of dynamic <b>restarts</b> used in heuristic satisfiability algorithms. By modifying a state-of-the-art SAT solver, zchaff, I test three proposed modifications to typical <b>restart</b> policies: exponentially increasing <b>restart</b> thresholds, restricting <b>restarts</b> to occur only at certain critical points, and the addition of transient randomness after a <b>restart.</b> By comparing runtimes on several benchmarks, I evaluate many of the tradeoffs involved in choosing an appropriate <b>restart</b> policy and also attempt to tackle {{the question of whether or}} not to use <b>restarts</b> at all. Section 1 introduces Chaff and the basic ideas of <b>restarts,</b> section 2 gives background on research on dynamic <b>restarts,</b> sections 3 - 5 described our proposed experiment, sections 6 - 8 describe the procedure, section 9 tabulates the results, and sections 10 - 11 give my conclusions...|$|R
40|$|The nonforgetting <b>restarting</b> {{automaton}} is a {{generalization of}} the <b>restarting</b> automaton that, when executing a <b>restart</b> operation, changes its internal state {{based on the}} current state and the actual contents of its read/write window instead of resetting it to the initial state. Another generalization of the <b>restarting</b> automaton is the cooperating distributed system (CD-system) of <b>restarting</b> automata. Here a finite system of <b>restarting</b> automata works together in analyzing a given sentence, where they interact based on a given mode of operation. As it turned out, CD-systems of <b>restarting</b> automata of some type X working in mode = 1 are just as expressive as nonforgetting <b>restarting</b> automata of the same type X. Further, various types of determinism have been introduced for CD-systems of <b>restarting</b> automata called strict determinism, global determinism, and local determinism, {{and it has been}} shown that globally deterministic CD-systems working in mode = 1 correspond to deterministic nonforgetting <b>restarting</b> automata. Here we derive some lower bound results for some types of nonforgetting <b>restarting</b> automata and for some types of CD-systems of <b>restarting</b> automata. In this way we establish separations between the corresponding language classes, thus providing detailed technical proofs for some of the separation results announced in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—As {{failure rate}} keeps on {{increasing}} in large systems, applications running atop <b>restart</b> {{more frequently than}} ever. Existing research on checkpoint/restart mainly focuses on optimizing checkpoint operation, without paying {{much attention to the}} <b>restart</b> operation. As a result, application <b>restart</b> latency maybe substantial, which greatly threatens system dependability and performance. To attack the <b>restart</b> latency problem, in this paper, we present FREM, a fast <b>restart</b> mechanism for general checkpoint/restart protocols. By dynamically tracking the process data accesses after each checkpoint, FREM masks <b>restart</b> latency by overlapping application recovery with the retrieval of its checkpoint image. We have implemented FREM as a prototype system and tested it under Linux environments. Extensive experiments with real applications demonstrate that it can effectively reduce <b>restart</b> latency by over 50 percent on average, as compared to the conventional <b>restart</b> mechanisms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} lookahead hierarchies for <b>restarting</b> automata with auxiliary symbols. We show that the class of languages for deterministic monotone or monotone <b>restarting</b> automaton, whose <b>restart</b> step and rewrite step are separated, coincides {{with that of the}} same type of <b>restarting</b> automaton whose <b>restart</b> and rewrite steps are not separated, for any fixed lookahead size. For the non-monotone deterministic case, the lookahead length must be approximately doubled. We then turn our attention to <b>restarting</b> automata with small lookahead. For the general <b>restarting</b> automaton model, we show that there are just two different classes of languages recognized, through the restriction of lookahead size: those with lookahead size 1 and those with lookahead size 2. We also show that the respective (left-) monotone <b>restarting</b> automaton models characterize the context-free languages and that the respective right-left-monotone <b>restarting</b> automata characterize the linear languages both with just lookahead length 2...|$|R

The workpieces that remain in the cell may limit the possibilities of executing certain operations needed to process the new workpieces correctly, thus complicating the <b>restart.</b> Properties of the <b>restart</b> states that guarantee a correct <b>restart</b> are defined, typical situations that make the system impossible to <b>restart</b> are presented, and some suggestions are given for modifications that make the system restartable...|$|R

The synthesis process finds all possible <b>restart</b> states, guaranteeing that the execution restrictions are fulfilled during a <b>restart,</b> and that the production goals can be maintained. The error and the corrective actions preceding the <b>restart</b> need not be modeled; neither is it necessary to know the exact physical states of the machines {{at the time of}} the error.

Further, as a tool used to simplify some of the proofs, the shrinking <b>restarting</b> automaton is introduced, which is a generalization of the standard (length-reducing) <b>restarting</b> automaton to the weight-reducing case.

40|$|The <b>RESTART</b> {{method is}} a widely {{applicable}} simulation technique for the estimation of rare event probabilities.
