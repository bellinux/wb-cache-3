5|$|Attitudes towards suicide slowly {{began to}} shift during the Renaissance.

40|$|What is the {{connection}} between <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> motives? According to Reasons Internalism there is a non-trivial conceptual connection between normative <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> the possibility of rationally accessing relevant motivation. Reasons Internalism is attractive insofar as it captures the thought that reasons are for reasoning with and repulsive insofar as it fails to generate sufficient critical distance between <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> motives. Rather than directly adjudicate this dispute, I extract from it two generally accepted desiderata on theories of normative <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> argue that a new theory can satisfy both. The new theory locates part {{of the meaning of}} normative reason statements in their role in normative discussion. It generates a view of {{the connection}} between <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> motives that is distinct from Reasons Internalism, yet distinctively in its spirit...|$|R

40|$|Roger Crisp has {{inspired}} two important criticisms of Scanlon's buck-passing account of value. I defend buck-passing {{from the wrong}} kind of <b>reasons</b> criticism, <b>and</b> the <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> the good objection. I support Rabinowicz and Rønnow-Rasmussen's dual role of reasons in refuting {{the wrong kind of}} reasons criticism, even where its authors claim it fails. Crisp's <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> the good objection contends that the property of goodness is buck-passing in virtue of its formality. I argue that Crisp conflates general and formal properties, and that Scanlon is ambiguous about whether the formal property of a reason can stop the buck. Drawing from Wallace, I respond to Crisp's <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> the good objection by developing an augmented buck-passing account of <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> value, where the buck is passed consistently from the formal properties of both to the substantive properties of considerations and evaluative attitudes. I end by describing two unresolved problems for buck-passers...|$|R
5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical <b>Reason</b> <b>and</b> Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be used to determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E

In 2006, he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for <b>Reason</b> <b>and</b> Science.|$|E

5|$|Original Stories is {{primarily}} about leaving the imperfections of childhood behind {{and becoming a}} rational and charitable adult; it does not romanticise childhood as an innocent and ideal state of being.

5|$|Shelley {{uses the}} {{historical}} novel {{to comment on}} gender relations; for example, Valperga is a feminist version of Scott's masculinist genre. Introducing women into the story who {{are not part of}} the historical record, Shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions. Shelley sets the male protagonist's compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative: <b>reason</b> <b>and</b> sensibility. In Perkin Warbeck, Shelley's other historical novel, Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship, domesticity, and equality. Through her, Shelley offers a feminine alternative to the masculine power politics that destroy the male characters. The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events.|$|E
