25|$|Frasier's {{apartment}} {{was designed to}} be ultra-modern in an eclectic style (as Frasier himself points out in the pilot). One of the show's signature elements that it became well known for was the apartment's design which included elements such as a slightly split-level design, doors with triangular wooden inlay features, numerous pieces of well-known high-end furniture pieces (such as a replica of Coco Chanel's sofa, and both Eames and Wassily Chairs) and a notable view from the terrace which was frequently complimented by visitors. The main set consisted of the open-concept living area with a sitting/TV space and dining area on the lower level and a piano exit to the terrace on the <b>rear</b> <b>upper</b> level. The set also included the kitchen through an open archway. A small section of the building corridor and elevator doors was built, as was a powder room near the front entrance. Two corridors off the living area ostensibly led to the apartment's three bedrooms. Sets for each of these rooms were built as separate sets on an as-needed basis.|$|E
500|$|The {{change in}} {{position}} of the guns and {{the extension of the}} air intakes, which looked [...] "uncannily like a double-barreled shotgun," [...] allowed the nosewheel to be moved forward to lengthen the wheelbase. The guns were mounted behind the nosewheel well and a special shield was added to protect the gun barrels from debris thrown up by the nosewheel; it was mechanically linked to the nosewheel and extended when it did. Other changes included the replacement of the original AM-5F engines by the Tumansky RD-9V, an improved version of the AM-5F, the normal bombload was increased to 1,000kg and [...] in overloaded condition, and a rearview mirror was added to allow the pilot to better observe the <b>rear</b> <b>upper</b> hemisphere.|$|E
500|$|Noise testing during 1996 and 1997 {{found that}} the {{hydrodynamic}} noise signature—the noise made by a submarine passing through the water—was excessive, particularly at high speed. The shape of the hull was the main cause: although a scale model of the design had been tested during the funded study and {{was found to have}} a minimal signature, the hull shape was changed after the contract was signed, primarily by a [...] lengthening of the submarine and a redesign of the bow dome to accommodate the larger-than-expected main sonar and reduce its blind spot (the baffles). The design had not been retested, as who would pay for this could not be agreed on. Propeller cavitation, caused by water flow over control surfaces onto the propeller at certain speeds, was the other main noisemaker. Cavitation had not been a problem with earlier Swedish submarine designs or during early testing of the Type 471 design, but the propeller had to be redesigned late in the process to provide more power, and like the redesigned hull, was not retested. During the years 2000, an unusual meeting took place with a next door neighbor (Francis 'Frank' Smith)of the then HMAS Stirling Naval Base commander. He was an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (originally trained at Government Aircraft Factories Fisherman's bend) who had been aware of the fluid dynamics issues of the Collins class for some time, purely by interest and observation on television. After a lengthy discussion, he was invited to discuss and demonstrate where possible, his observations at the Stirling Naval Base with Navy and DSTO staff who were there at that time as part of an investigative group. He showed on a white board, the aerofoil issue with the Dorsal – Sail conning tower structure showing that the Cord ratio (Length to Width) was too short and that severe turbulence / cavitation would be generated by such a design. This was demonstrated again on the white board using Aircraft aerofoil wing shapes as a basis for the discussion. That the turbulence / cavitation generated would, by natural rearward flow, move down the <b>rear</b> <b>upper</b> surface deck of the hull and be drawn into the propeller. He was also able to demonstrate that the design of the bow section would not pass a flow test for generated turbulence / cavitation, with the change in shape from circular bow section to long hull, being ill-conceived. He made several recommendations during the lecture that would be cost effective and possible. 1) To lengthen and taper the dorsal fin and create a more streamlined integration of the Dorsal to Flat upper Hull deck section. and 2) To 'fill in' the hollow section of hull aft of the bow curvature. Both these could be achieved with Carbon Fibre or Fibreglass covers as no load bearing strength would be required. Subsequent studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organization showed that the submarine's hull shape, particularly the redesigned sonar dome, the fin, and the rear of the submarine, focused the displaced water into two turbulent streams; when the seven propeller blades hit these streams, the propeller's vibration was increased, causing cavitation. These problems were fixed by modifying the casing of the submarine with fiberglass fairings.|$|E

2500|$|The Hampden Mk I had {{a crew of}} four: pilot, navigator/bomb aimer, radio {{operator}} and rear gunner. Conceived as a fast, manoeuvrable, [...] "fighting bomber", the Hampden had a fixed [...]303 in (7.7mm) Browning machine gun in the forward fuselage.

2500|$|The exact {{location}} of the initial fire, its source of ignition, {{and the source of}} fuel remain subjects of debate. The cause of the accident has never been determined conclusively, although many hypotheses have been proposed. Sabotage theories notwithstanding, one hypothesis often put forth involves a combination of gas leakage and atmospheric static conditions. Escaping hydrogen gas (in this specific case from incomplete or damaged vents {{along the top of the}} vessel and especially near the <b>rear</b> <b>upper</b> tail fin) will typically burn after mixing with air and will explode when mixed with air in the right proportions. This, along with the high static collected from flying within stormy conditions could have combined to ignite the leaking gas and down the airship. In addition, a certain amount of gas may have been inexplicably lost out the top of the vessel for, at the same time, water ballast was noticeably released to slow the rate of descent. The initial explosion would therefore have been the result of the quickening fire reaching the gas bags themselves via the compromised aft-most vent at the vessel's stern. Another more recent theory involves the airship's outer covering. The silvery cloth covering contained material including cellulose nitrate which is highly flammable. This theory is controversial and has been rejected by other researchers because the outer skin burns too slowly to account for the rapid flame propagation and gaps in the fire correspond with internal gas cell divisions, which wouldn't be visible if the fire spread across the skin first. Hydrogen fires had previously destroyed many other airships.|$|E
2500|$|The {{biggest change}} for the Torino was the switch to body-on-frame {{construction}} from the unit-construction of the 1971 models. The new chassis was a perimeter design {{that was used to}} help give the Torino a quieter and more isolated ride. It featured an energy absorbing [...] "S" [...] shaped front end, torque boxes to isolate road shock, fourteen rubber body mounts and five solid cross members. The front suspension used an unequal length control arm design, with a computer selected coil spring mounted on the strut stabilized lower control arm, much like the fullsize Ford LTD. The rear used the [...] "Stabul" [...] four link suspension with a computer selected coil spring mounted on a solid axle. The new suspension and chassis had a wheel track at least [...] wider than the 1971 models. [...] Motor Trend stated the [...] "road isolation and vibrational dampening is superb" [...] in its test of a 1972 Gran Torino Brougham 4-door. Ford offered two suspension options, the heavy-duty and competition suspension. The heavy-duty suspension included a larger front sway bar, and heavy-duty springs and shocks. [...] Competition suspension, only available in two-door models, included the most heavy-duty springs and shocks, heavy duty <b>rear</b> <b>upper</b> control arms and bushings, a larger front sway bar, and the addition of a rear sway bar. This was the first year that a rear sway bar was offered in the Torino and was only available with competition and police suspension options. Front disc brakes became standard on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the Mercury Montego) offered in 1972, however, power brakes remained an option. [...] The only exceptions were that power brakes were standard on the Gran Torino Squire station wagons and a mandatory option for all [...] powered models. The power steering was revised to be integral in the steering box, rather than the external booster style used in previous years. All Torinos used 14-inch wheels, while 15-inch wheels were used for exclusively by police and taxi models.|$|E
