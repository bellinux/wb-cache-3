The short arc mode is widely used in the pipe industry and very applicable to <b>root</b> <b>pass</b> welds in pipes. It can be utilized with carbon steel with 100 % carbon dioxide shielding gas or a blend of a maximum of 25 % CO 2 and a balance of argon. The short arc mode is also applicable to low carbon steel, low alloy steel, and stainless steel with thicknesses between 0.5 and 2.6  mm. However, it is unable to perform welding of aluminium (Deruntz 2003). Although, conventional short arc is used in many applications, its use is limited by high potential excessive spatter generation, fume generation, lack of fusion, lower gap bridgability, and arc instability (Hermans and Ouden 1999; Jenkins et al. 2005). The poor performance of conventional short arc results from the limited ability of the power source to control every sequence of the short circuiting metal transfer mode (Lyttle and Praxair 1990; Althouse et al. 2004; Laren 2004; Goecke 2005 a, b; Jeffus and Bower 2010). As a consequence of this limitation, conventional short arc is being progressively replaced by controlled short arc in root-pass sheet metal welding.|$|E

Neste trabalho se apresenta uma metodologia para união de tubos pelo processo de soldagem com a deposição do passe de raiz. Na realização da soldagem de topo, externa e sem abertura de raiz, a altura da face de raiz é um fator {{fundamental}} para obter penetração total. Em alguns casos, mata-juntas (podem ser de cobre o de materiais cerâmicos) são usadas para evitar vazamentos de solda. Porém, o cobre pode ocasionar inclusões e corrosão, além de trazer muitas dificuldades no momento de instalação e gerar grandes custos em campo. Assim sendo, realizou-se uma análise do efeito da penetração utilizando-se o método de fase de nariz decrescente na soldagem de passe de raiz sem uso de cobre-junta nem abertura de raiz, para as seguintes posições críticas de soldagem: plana, vertical e sobrecabeça. A análise foi feita utilizando o processo de soldagem MIG/MAG por curto-circuito derivativo, GMAW-CMT (Gas Metal Arc Welding - Cold Metal Transfer), com arame AWS ER 70 S- 6 (1, 2 mm) e o gás de proteção Ar+ 25 %CO 2. O Planejamento Composto Central foi utilizado como ferramenta para a melhor organização dos testes e para análise dos resultados fez-se uma otimização utilizando a teoria de Desirability para múltiplas respostas, usando chapas planas de aço 1020 com chanfro estreito em U. Logo, valida-se esta metodologia de penetração completa em soldagem orbital de meia volta descendente em um tubo ASTM 106 por meio do processo de soldagem curto-circuito convencional com a ajuda da potência de soldagem mesurada. Os testes foram realizados com arames consumíveis de diâmetros 0, 9 e 1, 2 mm. Ensaios de macrografia mostraram os passes de raiz com bom aspecto visual e sem defeitos internos, sugerindo assim a possibilidade de execução da soldagem com penetração total. _______________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTIn {{this manuscript}} is presented a methodology {{to realize the}} pipe union by the welding process with the deposition of the <b>root</b> <b>pass.</b> In the butt welding execution external without open root, {{the height of the}} root face is a key factor for getting full penetration. Sometimes, copper-joints are used to prevent leaks. Though, copper can cause inclusions and corrosion, producing many troubles during the installation and generating large costs in the work area. Therefore, it was performed a penetration effect analysis using the slanted nose phase, method in <b>root</b> <b>pass</b> welding without the use of copper-joint or root opening, for the following critical welding positions: flat, vertical and overhead.

The Central Composite Design (CCD) was used as a tool for a better organization of the tests, whereas to analyze the results it was made an optimization based on the Desirability theory for multiple responses, employing flat sheets of 1020 steel with a narrow-gap in U-shape. Then, this full penetration methodology in orbital welding turned down was validated in a ASTM 106 pipe through the conventional short-circuit welding process, with the joint established in the previous stages.
