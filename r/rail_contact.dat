50|$|With a train {{this problem}} is solved by using a wide tire. Train rails usually cross at a shallow angle. In {{the middle of the}} {{interchange}} there is a supporting frog. The tire is guided on each side by guide rails and some portion of the tire always maintains <b>rail</b> <b>contact.</b> This method is not feasible with trams and light railways.|$|E
50|$|Early toy trains {{used two}} metal rail tracks like most real trains. However, {{manufacturers}} quickly found that using a center rail for electric {{power and the}} two outer rails for common or ground made electrical contact much more reliable and less prone to short circuits. Three <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> also negates the need for insulated wheels, an important consideration before plastics became widely available. Most scales and gauges that predate HO scale used three rails for electric operation.|$|E

5000|$|The current land speed {{record of}} 2.9 km/s was {{obtained}} by a sled on 5 kilometers of rail track mostly in a helium-filled tunnel, in a $20 million project. [...] The Gen-1.5 version of the StarTram for launch of passenger RLVs at 4 km/s velocity {{from the surface of}} a mountain would be significantly higher speed with a far more massive vehicle. However, such would accelerate in a lengthy vacuum tunnel without air or gas drag, with levitation preventing hypervelocity physical <b>rail</b> <b>contact,</b> and with 3 orders of magnitude higher anticipated funding. Many challenges including high initial capital cost would overlap with Gen-1, though not having the levitated launch tube of Gen-2.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the new {{numbering}} scheme two of the trials engines from 1930 were also included in Class I. These were locomotives V 6016 and V 6017 (from 1931 Kö 0001 and Kö 0002) delivered by the Fürst-Stolberg-Hütte works at Ilsenburg. They did not acquit themselves well due to numerous defects and were retired again by 1932. Whilst, as early as 1931, the DRG had issued several specifications for locomotives in Class II, for Class I it simply ordered locomotives of the manufacturer's designs between 1931 and 1934, in order to keep procurement costs down. These locomotives were delivered by Jung, Orenstein & Koppel, Windhoff and Gmeinder. They were not permitted to leave the station, because they were too light to achieve reliable <b>rail</b> <b>contact.</b>|$|E
40|$|The maximal {{stress and}} {{tangential}} surface forces {{at the wheel}} <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> elliptic area {{are affected by the}} wheel <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> dynamic load and creepages. Dynamic wheel load is related to the wagon dynamic system, track and wheel rail interaction. Creepages are related to the motion of wheelset and wheel <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> parameters. The paper presents an analysis of the effects of creepages on wheel <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> forces. A complete Australia wagon with three-piece bogies was modelled and various tracks were selected for the simulation of dynamic wheel <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> stresses.

50|$|Magnetic brakes {{are used}} {{on high speed}} \ higher speed trains (maximum speed greater than 160 km/h (99.4 mph)). These are {{physically}} large pieces of metal mounted on the bogie of the vehicle, only a few centimetres above the track. They can sometimes be mistakenly detected by axle counters as another axle. This can happen only {{on one side of}} a track block, because of magnetic field curvature, defects of track geometry, or other issues, leading the signalling system into confusion and also requiring reset of the detection memory. Modern axle counters are 'eddy current' brake proof and the magnetic effect of the braking system as described above is overcome, therefore count information remains stable even when a vehicle fitted with magnetic brakes is braking whilst traversing the <b>rail</b> <b>contacts</b> of a detection point.|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} the methodologies based on multi-body systems {{used to analyze}} the dynamics of rail vehicle in motion in a straight line. Study of the railway vehicles dynamics requires the creation of three mutually independent models: the model of the vehicle, the track model and a model of the wheel – <b>rail</b> <b>contact.</b> A railway vehicle model developed in the multi-body systems convention w as an el ectric locomotive of the EU 07 symbol. The general software model of the wheel- <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> was programmed and is presented, which allows one in the course of analysis to determine the coordinates of the contact point between wheel and rail and thus the designation of the wheels forces in contact with the rail. The model of the contact forces includes normal force with damping hysteresis and tangential forces determined by the Polach method. Developed models were implemented in Matlab program environment. The numerical simulations were performed for the complete vehicle and a single bogie steady state conditions...|$|E

40|$|Processes {{occurring}} in a surface layer of solids in friction are simulated by {{the method of}} movable cellular automata (MCA). The model considered accounts for elastic and plastic deformations as well as detaching and welding of wear particles. It is shown that relative movement of solids {{gives rise to a}} turbulent layer localized at the friction surface, in which intensive processes of mechanical mixing occur. We investigate the friction coefficient due to inelastic processes in the turbulent layer as a function of material parameters (yield stress, fracture stress, elastic moduli, viscosity, density) and loading parameters (sliding velocity and normal pressure). Numerical simulations show that the friction coefficient does depend only on two dimensionless combinations of the mentioned parameters. Loading conditions in real wheel <b>rail</b> <b>contacts</b> are analyzed and friction coefficient is calculated as a function of temperature...|$|R

The <b>contact</b> <b>rails</b> may be either metal, wood, or plastic. Pressure plates may also have raised contact points, prongs, or a concave form to control contact with the reed. Some bands are designed for minimal contact with the mouthpiece, allowing even less absorption of the reed's vibrations.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{a description of}} tribological aspects and the latest type of laboratory equipment {{which is expected to}} offer particular new knowledge in the field of railway wheel - <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> phenomena diagnostics. The main considerations stated in this work imply that the coefficient of adhesion is among others dependent on contact temperature, and therefore it is possible to theoretically predict the value of the coefficient of adhesion. This fact has not been considered in the theory of adhesive contact so far. The entirely credible prognosis of the studied unfavourable effects is hardly satisfactorily solvable in theory. Hence, the authors present a new testing device by which the predicted effects will be verified. At the same time, the oscillation effect on the state of surface will be observed in the attached formulas. The work also implies that the effects evaluating possible initiations and local degradations of the contact area of railway wheel and rail are closely bound to the tribological effects that are comprehended here as dynamic processes.

40|$|Field {{testing of}} the wagon health card was {{completed}} using the RailCorp AK Track recording car. The wagon health card device was installed on the AK Car to allow the device to be tested and compared with the measured track data and AK car vehicle responses. As wheel <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> forces cannot be measured directly these were calculated using VAMPIRE simulation. An inverse model with parameters matching the AK Car was embedded in the wagon health card device. The inverse model had been developed in earlier research to predict wheel <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> forces using only measurements of car body responses; lateral and vertical accelerations, roll, pitch and yaw angular velocities. The device tested was also a proof of concept test for an integrated device with all transducers mounted within the one small 'black box'. Testing was completed in January 2007 on the Parks-Cobar section in NSW. The following paper presents the results and discusses the difficulties in validation without direct wheel-rail contact forces measurements. The results for estimating vertical contact forces were quite encouraging and acceptable for a proof of concept device. There was significant difference in lateral predictions and hence L/V ratios probably due to differences between assumed and actual wheel profiles...|$|E
