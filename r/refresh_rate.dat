5|$|Special {{consideration}} {{was given}} during filming {{to allow for}} integration of the planned special effects. Television monitors standing in for computer displays were specially calibrated so that their <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> {{did not result in}} banding on film. Due to a loss of resolution and quality resulting from rephotographing an element in an optical printer, live action sequences for effects were shot in 65mm or VistaVision formats to compensate. When the larger prints were reduced through an anamorphic lens on the printer, the result was a Panavision composite.|$|E
5|$|DisplayPort uses a self-clocking, micro-packet-based {{protocol}} {{that allows}} for a variable number of differential LVDS lanes as well as flexible allocation of bandwidth between audio and video, and allows encapsulating multi-channel compressed audio formats in the audio stream. DisplayPort 1.2 supports multiple audio/video streams, variable <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> (FreeSync), Display Stream Compression (DSC), and Dual-mode LVDS/TDMS transmitters compatible with HDMI 1.2 or 1.4. Revision 1.3 increases overall transmission bandwidth to 32.4Gbit/s with the new HBR3 mode featuring 8.1Gbit/s per lane; it requires Dual-mode with mandatory HDMI 2.0 compatibility and HDCP 2.2. Revision 1.4 adds support BT.2020 color space and HDR10 extensions from CTA-861.3, including static and dynamic metadata.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.2 was {{released}} on August 8, 2005 and added the option of One Bit Audio, used on Super Audio CDs, at up to 8 channels. To make HDMI more suitable for use on PC devices, version 1.2 also removed the requirement that only explicitly supported formats be used. It added the ability for manufacturers to create vendor-specific formats, allowing any arbitrary resolution and <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> rather than being limited to a pre-defined list of supported formats. In addition, it added explicit support for several new formats including 720p at 100 and 120Hz and relaxed the pixel format support requirements so that sources with only native RGB output (PC sources) would {{not be required to}} support YCBCR output.|$|E
5|$|For video {{resolutions and}} <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> {{up to and}} {{including}} 4K/60 Hz, the Dynamic HDR, Game Mode VRR and eARC features are supported with the existing HDMI cables. Higher resolutions and <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> than 4K/60 Hz, such as 4K/120 Hz and 8K/60 Hz, require new 48G cables.|$|R

25|$|Usually no refresh-rate flicker, {{because the}} LCD pixels hold their state between refreshes (which are usually done at 200Hz or faster, {{regardless}} of the input <b>refresh</b> <b>rate).</b>|$|E
25|$|Temporal performance: the {{temporal}} resolution of an LCD {{is how well}} it can display changing images, or the accuracy {{and the number of}} times per second the display draws the data it is being given. LCD pixels do not flash on/off between frames, so LCD monitors exhibit no refresh-induced flicker no matter how low the <b>refresh</b> <b>rate.</b> But a lower <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> can mean visual artefacts like ghosting or smearing, especially with fast moving images. Individual pixel response time is also important, as all displays have some inherent latency in displaying an image which can be large enough to create visual artifacts if the displayed image changes rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Electronic paper {{technologies}} {{have a very}} low <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> compared to other low-power display technologies, such as LCD. This prevents producers from implementing sophisticated interactive applications (using fast-moving menus, mouse pointers or scrolling) like those common on standard mobile devices. An example of this limit is that a document cannot be smoothly zoomed without either extreme blurring during the transition or a very slow zoom.|$|E

50|$|Increases in {{publicly}} released <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> {{have grown}} slowly {{over the past}} few years, with respect to vast leaps in power consumption reduction and miniaturization demand. This has led to a new demand for longer battery life and reductions in size due to the mobile technology being produced at a greater rate. This change in focus from greater <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> to power consumption and miniaturization can be shown by the significant reductions in power consumption, as much as 50%, that were reported by Intel in their release of the Haswell (microarchitecture); where they dropped their power consumption benchmark from 30-40 watts down to 10-20 watts. Comparing this to the processing speed increase of 3 GHz to 4 GHz (2002 to 2006) {{it can be seen that}} the focus in research and development are shifting away from <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> and moving towards consuming less power and taking up less space.|$|R
25|$|A system sending {{all three}} signals {{at the same}} time at a {{conventional}} <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> would be greatly preferable. Transmitting such a signal could be accomplished by using three camera tubes, each with a color filter in front of them, using mirrors or prisms to aim at the same scene through a single lens. Each signal would then be separately broadcast using three conventional TV channels, and using the luminance concept, one of those could be received on a conventional black and white set. This would use a considerable amount of bandwidth, but this was a small cost in the era of only a few television channels.|$|E
2500|$|Low <b>refresh</b> <b>rate.</b> All {{but a few}} {{high-end}} monitors support {{no higher}} than while this does not cause visible flicker due to the LCD panel's high internal <b>refresh</b> <b>rate,</b> the low input <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> limits the maximum frame-rate that can be displayed, affecting gaming and 3D graphics.|$|E
2500|$|On January 6, 2016, Dell {{announced}} the Ultrasharp UP3017Q OLED monitor at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The monitor was announced to feature a 30" [...] 4K UHD OLED panel with a 120 Hz <b>refresh</b> <b>rate,</b> 0.1 millisecond response time, and a contrast ratio of 400,000:1.The monitor {{was set to}} sell at a price of $4,999 and release in March, 2016, {{just a few months}} later. As the end of March rolled around, the monitor was not released to the market and Dell did not speak on reasons for the delay. Reports suggested that Dell canceled the monitor as the company was unhappy with the image quality of the OLED panel, especially the amount of color drift that it displayed when you viewed the monitor from the sides. On April 13, 2017, Dell finally released the UP3017Q OLED monitor to the market at a price of $3,499 ($1,500 less than its original spoken price of $4,999 at CES 2016). In addition to the price drop, the monitor featured a 60 Hz <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> and a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1. As of June, 2017, the monitor is no longer available to purchase from Dell's website.|$|E
50|$|The USB-based Nvidia 3D Vision kit {{released}} in 2008 supports CRT monitors capable of 100, 110, or 120 Hz <b>refresh</b> <b>rates,</b> {{as well as}} 120 Hz LCD monitors.|$|R
50|$|For example, when testing {{semiconductor}} memory: voltages, temperature, and <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> can be varied over specified ranges {{and only}} certain combinations {{of these factors}} will allow the device to operate. Plotted on independent axes (voltage, temperature, <b>refresh</b> <b>rates),</b> the range of working values will enclose a three-dimensional, usually oddly-shaped volume. Other examples of conditions and inputs that can be varied include frequency, temperature, timing parameters, system- or component-specific variables, and even varying knobs tweakable during silicon chip fabrication producing parts of varying quality which are then used in the process.|$|R

2500|$|SDRAM {{designed}} for battery-powered devices offers some additional power-saving options. One is temperature-dependent refresh; an on-chip temperature sensor reduces the <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> at lower temperatures, rather than always running {{it at the}} worst-case rate. [...] Another is selective refresh, which limits self-refresh to {{a portion of the}} DRAM array. The fraction which is refreshed is configured using an extended mode register. The third, implemented in Mobile DDR (LPDDR) and LPDDR2 is [...] "deep power down" [...] mode, which invalidates the memory and requires a full reinitialization to exit from. This is activated by sending a [...] "burst terminate" [...] command while lowering CKE.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2012, most {{implementations}} of LCD backlighting use pulse-width modulation (PWM) to dim the display, {{which makes}} the screen flicker more acutely (this does not mean visibly) than a CRT monitor at 85Hz <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> would (this is because the entire screen is strobing on and off rather than a CRT's phosphor sustained dot which continually scans across the display, leaving {{some part of the}} display always lit), causing severe eye-strain for some people. [...] Unfortunately, many of these people don't know that their eye-strain is being caused by the invisible strobe effect of PWM. This problem is worse on many LED-backlit monitors, because the LEDs switch on and off faster than a CCFL lamp.|$|E
2500|$|Instead, {{a number}} of hybrid {{solutions}} were developed that combined a conventional monochrome display with a colored disk or mirror. In these systems the three colored images were sent one after each other, in either complete frames in the [...] "field-sequential color system", or for each line in the [...] "line-sequential" [...] system. In both cases a colored filter was rotated {{in front of the}} display in sync with the broadcast. Since three separate images were being sent in sequence, if they used existing monochrome radio signaling standards they would have an effective <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> of only 20 fields, or 10 frames, a second, well into the region where flicker would become visible. In order to avoid this, these systems increased the frame rate considerably, making the signal incompatible with existing monochrome standards.|$|E
5000|$|... ix3D Pro Rez was a 128-bit 2D and 3D {{graphics}} accelerator with 8 MB of SGRAM. It supports resolutions up to 1600x1200 and <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> {{as high as}} 100 Hz.|$|R
5000|$|Less visible motion blur, {{thanks in}} large part to very high <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> and a faster {{response}} time, contributing to superior performance when displaying content with significant amounts of rapid motion.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} displays this {{consists of}} changing the frame rate of the produced signal in the video card (and in sync with this, the displayed image on the display). This {{is limited by the}} clock speed of the video adapter and frame rate required of the program - for a given pixel clock speed, higher <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> require lower resolution or color depth, and higher frame rates require that the program producing the video recalculate the screen more frequently. For these reasons, <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> above 90-100 Hz to reduce flicker are uncommon on computers - these rates are sufficient to eliminate flicker.|$|R
2500|$|The Kindle Keyboard is {{available}} in two versions. One of these, the Kindle Wi-Fi, was initially priced at $139 and connects to the Internet via Wi-Fi networks. The other version called the Kindle 3G, was priced at $189 and includes both 3G and Wi-Fi connectivity. The built-in free 3G connectivity uses the same wireless signals that cell phones use, allowing it to download and purchase content from any location with cell service. The Kindle Keyboard {{is available}} in two colors: classic white and graphite. Both versions use a E Ink [...] "Pearl" [...] display, which has a higher contrast than prior displays and a faster <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> than prior e-ink displays. However, it remains significantly slower than traditional LCDs. An ad-supported version, the [...] "Kindle with Special Offers" [...] was introduced on May 3, 2011, with a price $25 lower than the no ads version, for $114. On July 13, 2011, Amazon announced that due to a sponsorship with AT, {{the price of the}} Kindle 3G with ads would be $139, $50 less than the Kindle 3G without ads.|$|E

50|$|Different {{operating}} systems set the default <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> differently. Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows 98 (First and Second Editions) set the <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> {{to the highest}} rate that they believe the display supports.
