25|$|Attending the {{ceremony}} of the king's waking at Versailles (the smaller and intimate petit lever du roi {{and the more}} formal grand lever du roi), being asked to cross the barriers that separated the royal bed from the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> being invited {{to talk to the}} king, or being mentioned by the king... all were signs of favor and actively sought after.|$|E
25|$|Henri Matisse {{reduced the}} {{rendering}} of still-life objects even further {{to little more}} than bold, flat outlines filled with bright colors. He also simplifyied perspective and introducing multi-color backgrounds. In some of his still-life paintings, such as Still Life with Eggplants, his table of objects is nearly lost amidst the other colorful patterns filling the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Other exponents of Fauvism, such as Maurice de Vlaminck and André Derain, further explored pure color and abstraction in their still life.|$|E
500|$|With {{but a few}} notable exceptions, the {{interiors}} of the palazzi were from the start less elaborate than those of Sicily's Baroque churches. Many were finished without ornate interior decoration, simply because they {{took so long to}} build {{and by the time they}} were completed Baroque had passed from fashion; the principal rooms were therefore decorated in the new neoclassical style known as [...] "Pompeian". Often one can find a fusion of the two styles, as in the ballroom wing of the Palazzo Aiutamicristo in Palermo, built by Andrea Giganti in 1763, where the ballroom ceiling was frescoed by Giuseppe Cristadoro with allegorical scenes framed by Baroque gilded motifs in plaster. This ceiling was already old-fashioned when it was finished, and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> was decorated in a far simpler mode. Changing use over the past 250 years has simplified palazzo decor further, as the ground floors are now usually shops, banks, or restaurants, and the upper floors divided into apartments, their interiors lost.|$|E
50|$|The {{house has}} a total of 8 rooms. 2 of these rooms are {{dedicated}} for house guests and a single <b>room</b> for <b>the</b> caretakers. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> are reserved for <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pelaez clan who wish to visit {{and stay in the}} house.|$|R
50|$|One {{feature of}} many older Gulf farmhouses is the {{so-called}} Upkammer (upkååmer), a <b>room</b> in <b>the</b> living quarters, that is higher than <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> because it sits above a half-sunken cellar. This can often be recognised from <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> such buildings by the window arrangement.|$|R
60|$|After {{a cursory}} glance at <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms,</b> from {{basement}} to attic, {{we came to}} the conclusion that <b>the</b> dining <b>room</b> contained any effects which might belong to the Count. And so we proceeded to minutely examine them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on <b>the</b> great dining <b>room</b> table.|$|R
2500|$|While it {{has been}} speculated that Johns Hopkins has {{relatively}} few traditions for a school of its age and that many past traditions have been forgotten, a handful of myths and customs are ubiquitous knowledge among the community. One such long-standing myth surrounds the university seal that is embedded into {{the floor of the}} Gilman Hall foyer. [...] The myth holds that any current student to step on the seal will never graduate. [...] In reverence for this tradition, the seal has been fenced off from the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} one of {{the ordinary}} valets was en poste by the King's bed all day, inside the balustrade that separated it, like an altar communion-rail, from the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] In the morning Levée and evening Coucher ceremonies, the Grand Chamberlain of France and Premier valet did the work, whilst the First Gentleman of the bedchamber (rotating annually among the four holders) had [...] "the command of the room" [...] (le commandement de la chambre). [...] However, Saint-Simon explains carefully that if the First Gentleman {{of the year was}} absent, the Premier valet of the quarter was en commande of the ceremony, attended daily by about a hundred of the greatest courtiers – a significant point of prestige.|$|E
2500|$|Critically, Frederic Payraudeau {{writes in}} French that [...] "the Divine Adoratrix or God's Wife of Amun Shepenupet I, the last Libyan Adoratrix, {{was still alive}} {{during the reign of}} Shebitku because she is {{represented}} performing rites and is described as [...] "living" [...] in those parts of the Osiris-Héqadjet chapel built during his reign (wall and exterior of the gate) In the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> it is Amenirdis I, Shabaka's sister), who is represented with the Adoratrix title and provided with a coronation name. The succession Shepenupet I - Amenirdis I as God's Wife of Amun or Divine Adoratrix thus took place during the reign of Shebitku. This detail in itself is sufficient to show that the reign of Shabaka cannot precede that of Shebitku.|$|E
5000|$|The museum {{incorporates}} <b>the</b> {{upper floors}} <b>of</b> its neighbour at 23 Brook Street, which was <b>the</b> home <b>of</b> rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix in 1968-69. These rooms {{were used for}} temporary exhibitions and events, but after fundraising, these and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> from <b>the</b> Hendrix apartment were {{opened to the public}} in February 2016 as [...] "Handel and Hendrix in London".

50|$|The {{building}} is compact in size, measuring only 20 m long by 10 m wide. Its original design envisioned a foyer, guest <b>room,</b> stairway to <b>the</b> tower, and two bedrooms {{on two different}} levels within the tower. <b>The</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guest <b>room</b> is decorated with wooden panels; <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> are stuccoed and painted. An observation deck rings the building, providing a view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea, and Yalta's distant shoreline.|$|R
50|$|This room {{is open to}} {{the public}} on one day a year, <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> annual Blandford Forum Georgian Fayre, held on the first Monday in May. For <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year, <b>the</b> <b>room</b> is used as a {{storeroom}} for Age Concern's charity shop which leases part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grade I listed property.|$|R
2500|$|Critically, it {{was first}} pointed out by Baker and then later by Frederic Payraudeau who wrote in French that [...] "the Divine Adoratrix ie. God's Wife of Amun Shepenupet I," [...] the last Libyan Adoratrix, was still alive {{during the reign of}} Shebitku/Shabataqo because she is {{represented}} performing rites and is described as “living” in those parts of the Osiris-Héqadjet chapel built during his reign (wall and exterior of the gate) In the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> it is Amenirdis I, Shabaka's sister), who is represented with the Adoratrix title and provided with a coronation name.

60|$|Phil was open-mouthed. Ruth laughed. The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> gasped. Mason Winslow, {{long and}} bald, was {{worrying}} over {{the question of}} How to Receive Aviators at Tea.|$|E
60|$|We found a quiet {{corner in}} the smoking-room, {{where there was a}} little recess {{partitioned}} off from the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> My companion drew a small card-case from his pocket.|$|E
50|$|Although the Owl Tower {{is mainly}} a {{residential}} building, some storeys are meant for office or commercial use. Stores {{are located in}} the 1st basement and on the 1st floor, while offices can be found from the 2nd to the 6th floor. Apartments are situated on the remaining floors, up to the 52nd. There are 11 elevators in the skyscraper. The total floor space <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building equals roughly 79,200 m2. There are approximately 608 units, 473 of which are for residential purposes, and 135 of which are for non-residential purposes, with <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> including a theater room, a fitness room, and a sky lounge, among others. 344 parking spaces are contained within the Owl Tower.|$|R
5000|$|At {{least partly}} {{to get away}} from her mother, Yvonne married 32-year-old Alex Rudellat on 16 October 1920. Alex was an Italian national, an ex-cavalryman and {{undercover}} agent in the Italian army, but now a head waiter at the Piccadilly Hotel, also in Regent Street. Unfortunately for Yvonne, Alex, following Italian tradition, invited his widowed mother-in-law to stay with them, which she did {{for a number of years}} before returning to France. The Rudellats had one child, Constance Jacqueline, who was born in 1922. They stayed at a number of addresses around Pimlico in houses bought by Alex as an investment; they let rooms not used by themselves. Latterly they occupied the basement at 146 Warwick Way, letting <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms.</b> During this period a young Joan Littlewood let one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms,</b> while studying at RADA.|$|R

"Kent, order <b>the</b> {{women out}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zenana into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other <b>rooms.</b> Tell {{them that they}} will all be searched as they come out, and that if one brings out an {{ornament}} or a jewel with her she {{will be put to}} death. Of course you will not search them; but the threat will do. Let no insult be offered them. Then let Rivers take four men, and go in, and take all the loot you can find. The jewels we will divide among the men when at Meerut. Tell off another party to loot <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms,</b> but only take what is really valuable and portable. We cannot cumber ourselves with baggage. It would serve the rajah right if I were to burn his castle down; he may think himself lucky to get off with his life." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rose, who had {{hitherto}} stood facing Mr. Grey, {{with her}} back to the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> obeyed, and at once exclaimed, [...] "Aunt Alison," [...] then suddenly recoiled, and grasped at the Colonel.|$|E
60|$|She seated herself after a moment's hesitation. He {{moved his}} chair {{a little closer}} to hers. The pink-shaded lamp seemed to shut them off from the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> A waiter poured wine into their glasses.|$|E
6000|$|Fairway had {{meanwhile}} {{concluded a}} critical gaze at Yeobright.

60|$|<b>The</b> service <b>of</b> dinner continued. Outside, {{the water}} from the {{fountain}} fell into the basin with a gentle, monotonous sound. <b>The</b> perfume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roses stole through the open doorway. One softly-shaded lamp had been lit, but <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lofty <b>room</b> remained in shadowy obscurity. The light from that one lamp seemed to fall full upon Madame Christophor's beautiful face.|$|R
6000|$|Down <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber ran a long {{square-ended}} {{table of}} oak, very plain like all <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room's</b> scant furnishings. At <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> this table was an arm-chair for my mother, of bare wood without any cushion to relieve its hardness, whilst {{on either side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board stood a few lesser chairs for those who habitually dined there. These were, besides myself, Fra Gervasio, my tutor; Messer Giorgio, the castellan, a bald-headed old man long since past the fighting age and who in times of stress would have been as useful for purposes of defending Mondolfo as Lorenza, my mother's elderly woman, who sat below him at the board; he was toothless, bowed, and decrepit, {{but he was very}} devout--as he had need to be, seeing that he was half dead already--and this counted with my mother above any other virtue.2 ...|$|R
60|$|Blakeney {{had once}} more taken up his {{favourite}} position, {{sitting on the}} corner of the table, his broad shoulders interposed between the lamp and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> He was apparently taking no notice of Armand, but only intent on the delicate operation of polishing his nails.|$|E
60|$|A silence followed, {{which she}} endeavoured to break, but she sat still across the little table from him where the shaded lamp spread its glow, leaving the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> with its red {{curtains}} and its sketches pinned about, in a warm, luxurious shadow. Her eyes fell, {{and she did}} not speak.|$|E
6000|$|It quite {{dominated}} all the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> at first, it flaunted like a flag {{of triumph}} over [...] "discipline" [...] and the time-table and the Schema.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex {{contains}} <b>rooms</b> {{and meeting}} spaces {{which can be}} booked out for society use. In a building towards <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot is the Pleasance sports centre and gym.|$|R
50|$|Monica resumed her {{position}} as Chief of Staff at General Hospital after completing rehab. While assisting in a patient's operation, Monica, along with <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation <b>room's</b> surgical staff, was infected with an airborne toxin that {{was inside the}} patient. She {{was taken to the}} ICU at Mercy, but was quickly released. Monica immediately took to newcomer Rebecca Shaw, Emily's twin sister, and shared with Rebecca her own breast cancer struggle.|$|R
50|$|Badi Mahal (Great Palace) {{also known}} as Garden Palace is the central palace {{situated}} on a 27 m high natural rock formation bis-a-bis <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palace. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> on <b>the</b> ground floor appear to be at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourth floor in view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> height difference to its surrounding buildings. There is a swimming pool here, which was then used for Holi festival (festival of colors) celebration. In an adjoining hall, miniature paintings of 18th and 19th centuries are displayed. In addition, wall paintings of Jag Mandir (as it appeared in the 18th century), Vishnu <b>of</b> Jagdish temple, <b>the</b> very courtyard and an elephant fight scene are depicted.|$|R
60|$|He {{drew the}} parcel {{out of his}} pocket and, turning his back to the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> he cut the string and undid the paper that wrapped it. The {{contents}} of the parcel proved to be a morocco case, which flew open at a touch and displayed a gold curb chain bracelet--the dream of Klara Goldstein's desires.|$|E
60|$|Now she {{had found}} the intruder, she was less afraid than angry that he had pulled about her clothes with his coarse, dirty hands. She knew him, for he was the {{teamster}} she {{had seen in the}} orchard. The beam that picked him out, however, left the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> in gloom, {{and it was hard to}} hold the torch steady.|$|E
60|$|The fire in my {{room had}} burned low in my absence. One of the closed {{curtains}} had been drawn back a few inches, so as to admit through the window a ray of the dying light. On the boundary limit where the light was crossed by the obscurity which filled the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> I saw Miss Dunross seated, with her veil drawn and her writing-case on her knee, waiting my return.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, in a stunt for a {{commercial}} for the Nvidia Shield Android TV streaming device, Provenzano jumped out of an airplane in a 10,000-foot freefall while sitting strapped to a couch surrounded by a television, coffee table, and other items found in a regular living <b>room.</b> Sitting on <b>the</b> couch as it falls out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airplane, Provenzano watches television and plays video games, unstrapping himself before landing safely as <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living <b>room</b> crashes to <b>the</b> ground.|$|R
50|$|An {{undercover}} {{police officer}} (disguised as a handyman) comes into Gaby and Carlos' house to bug Ellie's <b>room</b> and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> in <b>the</b> house {{to find out}} who her supplier is. While in Ellie's room while she is out, Gaby and the handyman are almost caught when Ellie re-appears to retrieve her wallet. Gaby kisses the handyman and Ellie appears in <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> She is shocked, and Gaby says that she and the handyman are having an affair as a cover-up. Later, Ellie tells Carlos and Gaby feels betrayed. However, Gaby explains what happened to Carlos and he believes her. Gaby and Ellie then have a talk, and Ellie reveals that her father caught her mother having an affair and walked out on the family. Ellie's mom apparently went crazy, and Ellie ended up on the streets selling drugs to make money. Gaby automatically feels sympathy and feels guilty for turning Ellie in. But Ellie's supplier shows up at the house, and the police arrest him. Gaby, who feels connected with Ellie, helps her escape by telling her to go through the back door.|$|R
2500|$|Two large {{double doors}} on the east wall opened {{to the first floor}} {{assembly}} hall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower court, known as the [...] "Great Hall", which occupied <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floor space east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vestibule.
