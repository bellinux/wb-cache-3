40|$|The present paper reviews {{key issues}} in pension design and pension reform {{encountered}} {{all across the}} world. The paper heavily refers to the recent U. S. Social Security reform debate in general and to the Personal Retirement Accounts proposal in particular. A particular emphasis is put on annuitization and risk-taking in the economy. Our discussion signals some inadequacy of the proposed measures {{with respect to the}} goals of viability of the system and individual financial security during <b>retirement.</b> <b>Pension</b> funds;Aging;Financial safety nets;pension, <b>retirement,</b> social security, <b>pensions,</b> social insurance, <b>pension</b> system, early <b>retirement,</b> <b>pension</b> liabilities, private pensions, public pension, moral hazard, <b>pension</b> reform, <b>retirement</b> income, disability, <b>pension</b> plans, inflation risk, actuarial neutrality, labor force, pension plan, investment risk, defined benefit, pension systems, defined contribution plans, pension schemes, social security system, life expectancy, <b>pension</b> fund, <b>retirement</b> behavior, private <b>pension,</b> pensioners, social security benefits, longevity risk, retirement savings, social security reform, guaranteed rate, minimum benefit, public pension systems, entitlements, public <b>pensions,</b> <b>retirement</b> benefits, <b>pension</b> payments, unemployment, payroll taxes, <b>pension</b> benefit, <b>retirement</b> programs, <b>pension</b> scheme, age of retirement, long-term care, moral hazard problems, private savings, individual account, elderly, minimum benefit guarantees, benefit entitlements, welfare programs, retirement accounts, annuity payout, <b>pension</b> products, <b>retirement</b> age, public <b>pension</b> system, public pension schemes, life annuities, disabled, pension arrangements, future pension, indexed bonds, <b>pension</b> arrangement, <b>retirement</b> system, social insurance programs, pension assets, payroll tax, social safety net, retirement program, retirement income systems, average retirement age, old age, social security benefit, public scheme, defined benefit pension, private pension arrangements, disability insurance, early <b>retirement</b> programs, minimum <b>pension,</b> disability benefits, public pension reform, compulsory membership, pension obligations, defined benefit pension plans, survivor benefits, price indexation, benefit formula, public sector pensions, benefit pension, annuity markets, occupational pension, contribution rate, national accounts, pension benefits, <b>pension</b> insurance, earlier <b>retirement,</b> <b>pension</b> savings, individual accounts, <b>retirement</b> <b>pensions,</b> social insurance systems, supplementary schemes, pension choices, pension investment, cash balance, public system, net return, pensioner, funded <b>pension,</b> <b>retirement</b> ages, social programs, minimum benefits, defined contribution plan, <b>pension</b> wealth, <b>retirement</b> options, <b>pension</b> <b>rights,</b> <b>pension</b> debate, health care, retirement assets, labor force participation, assets valuation, tax rates, under-funded pension plan, old-age pensions, individual account system, old-age pension, net pension liabilities, individual pensioners, entitlement, <b>retirement</b> period, <b>pension</b> pillar, employee <b>retirement,</b> unemployment insurance, annuity rates, retirement plans, value of pension, old-age pension systems, pension income, annuity market, life insurance, <b>retirement</b> policies, occupational <b>pension</b> plan, life insurers, private <b>pension</b> plan, <b>retirement</b> decision, public <b>pension</b> scheme, disabled people, pension liability, thrift savings plan, social security <b>pension,</b> <b>retirement</b> income system, contingent liabilities, investment choices, implicit <b>pension</b> debt, <b>retirement</b> income security, <b>pension</b> debt, <b>retirement</b> products, retirement incentives, payment of pension, earnings history, average retirement ages, indexed annuities, pension asset, pension regime, annuity purchases, pension policy, social insurance system, income security, occupational pension plans, social insurance schemes, social security taxes, retirement policy, financial security during retirement, social insurance scheme, formal pension, social protection, cash balance plans, insurance companies, pillar pension, elderly people, pension insurance premiums, pension providers, pillar systems, company pensions, net wages...|$|R

40|$|Migrants as a {{group are}} {{recognised}} as being at risk of receiving low <b>retirement</b> <b>pensions.</b> Income over a lifetime is the principle for calculating <b>pension</b> <b>rights.</b> We have interviewed a group of migrants about their retirement preparations. Our results show that there are obstacles that obstruct migrants from entering the Swedish labour market, which will greatly influence future <b>pension</b> <b>rights.</b> There are various lock-in effects that isolate migrants from the labour market and thus affect their present and future financial situation. Examples are labour market policy activities and that the minimum level pensions have mobility restrictions. These trajectories are set in perspective to Nancy Fraser’s reasoning on justice in a transnational setting and Yeheskel Hasenfeld’s reflections on people processing. An important implication from our findings {{is the need to}} explore ways to include a group that is currently excluded from the labour market, hence adequate retirement income protection...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} {{budget deficit}} {{caused by the}} privatization of a public pension plan does not imply a relaxation of the stance of fiscal policy. The reform''s impact on the fiscal stance and national saving depends primarily on {{its effect on the}} sum of explicit and implicit public debt and on the post-reform payroll tax and private system contribution rates. However, the precise impact of reform also depends on such influences as the relationship between the rates of interest on implicit and explicit public debt. There may be circumstances in which pension privatization, if not offset by fiscal consolidation, will loosen the fiscal stance.

40|$|With asset values falling {{sharply in}} recent years, many {{companies}} {{around the world}} are under pressure to restore the solvency of their defined-benefit pension plans. Will this lead to higher contributions? Will higher contributions increase labor costs and reduce employment? Does this mechanism exacerbate economic downturns? What are the economic effects of pension fund regulation? This paper develops a theoretical model to address these questions. Although its scope is more general, the model captures the main institutional features of the pension system in the Netherlands, a country where the economic effects of the pension shock are widely debated.

40|$|This article takes {{issue with}} the {{neoliberal}} conception of justice that has informed much of <b>retirement</b> <b>pension</b> policy in recent decades. Drawing upon an appraisal of a spectrum of liberal philosophical perspectives, it develops an evaluative framework that specifies the appropriate normative foundations of the design of <b>retirement</b> <b>pension</b> systems. We contend that justice is comprised of three core principles: need, which legitimates the social minimum {{that is necessary to}} sustain an adequate standard of living for the least advantaged; desert, which provides a justification for allocating income in accordance with differentials in work participation prior to retirement; and equality, which provides a normative rationale for universal citizenship entitlements.

40|$|A recent {{question}} {{in relation to}} pensions Acquiring individual <b>pension</b> <b>rights</b> has always been more difficult for women than for men. Because of their lesser presence on the labour market, linked, among other factors, to their still-dominant role in domestic tasks and child care, the <b>retirement</b> <b>pension</b> they receive remains limited in comparison to that of men. This observation {{can be made in}} most European countries, with differences linked to the degree of female labour market participation and the structure of the pension system, since different systems attenuate labour market disparities to varying degrees. Women’s own pensions (1) are thus far lower than those of men. Nevertheless, the question of gender equality in pensions received relatively little attention in the pensions debate until around fifteen years ago. (2) For France, Brocas (2004) gives a historical overview of the question of women and pensions, and observes that this dimension has been largely neglected since the 1980 s.
