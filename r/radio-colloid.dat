40|$|Aim. Following the {{availability}} of the results ofvalidation studies, the sentinel lymph node biopsy(SLNB) has replaced routine axillary dissection(AD) as the new standard of care in early unifocal breast cancers. Multifocal (MF) and multicentric (MC) tumours have been considered as a contraindication for this technique due to the possible incidence of a higher false-negative rate. In this retrospective study we try to demonstrate the usefulness of SLNB in MF/MC breast carcinoma. Patients and Methods. Eight hundreds and fiftyeightpatients with breast carcinoma underwent a conservative surgery and sentinel node excision. Ninety-four out of 858 patients had histological diagnosis of multifocal breast carcinoma; out of these patients, 22 had SLN localization by both <b>radio-colloid</b> and blue dye, and 72 had localization by <b>radio-colloid</b> only. Results. Using radioisotope technique SLN was identified in 90 / 94 cases (95. 7...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background For {{accurate}} nodal staging, all {{blue and}} radioactive lymph nodes should be sampled during the sentinel {{lymph node biopsy}} for breast cancer. We report a case of anomalous drainage in {{which one of the}} sentinel lymph nodes was unexpectedly found in the level III axillary space. Case presentation A 40 -year-old female underwent mastectomy for extensive high-grade ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) with micro-invasion. The index lesion was located in the right upper inner quadrant. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed on the morning of surgery. Two sentinel lymph nodes were identified. At operation, 5 mls of isosulfan blue dye was injected at the same site of the <b>radio-colloid</b> injection. The first sentinel lymph node was found at level I and was blue and radioactive. The second sentinel node was detected in an unexpected anomalous location at level III, medial to the pectoralis minor. Both sentinel nodes were negative. Conclusion Sentinel node staging can lead to unexpected patterns of lymphatic drainage. For accurate staging, it is important to survey all potential sites of nodal metastasis either with preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and/or rigorous examination of regional nodal basins with the intra-operative gamma probe. </p...|$|E

Preoperative lymphatic mapping in conjunction with intraoper-ative γ-probe detection is widely used for sentinel node locali-zation in melanoma, breast cancer, and other malignancies. 99 mTc-radiocolloids have been the standard radiotracers used for sentinel node mapping. 99 mTc-tilmanocept is a receptor-binding molecular imaging agent approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for lymphatic mapping and lymph node localization in breast cancer, melanoma, clinically node-negative squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, and other solid tumors. It has several advantages over conventional <b>radio-colloids,</b> including rapid injection site clearance, high sentinel node extraction, and low distal node accumulation, which can lead to efficient resource use...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) is the {{standard}} of care for staging axillary lymph nodes in women with breast cancer and clinically negative nodes.

40|$|Background: Sentinel {{lymph node}} (SN) biopsy based on dual {{labeling}} with blue dye and <b>radio-colloid</b> can reliably determine lymph node status in early-stage cervical cancer, but few {{data are available}} on its accuracy in more advanced disease. We examined the influence of tumor stage on the accuracy of SN biopsy in patients with cervical cancer. Methods: Between July 2001 and June 2004, 33 patients (mean age 52 years) with early-stage or locally advanced cervical cancer underwent laparoscopic SN biopsy based on dual labeling with patent blue and radiocolloid. Patients with early-stage cervical cancer (stages IA and IB 1, 23 patients) underwent complete laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy after the SN procedure. Patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (stage IB 2, IIA or IIB, 10 patients) underwent laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy after SN biopsy and prior neoadjuvant concomitant che-moradiotherapy. The SN identification rates and false-negative rates of patients with early-stage and locally advanced disease were compared. Results: The mean numbers of SNs identified per patient with early-stage and locally advanced cervical cancer were 2. 3 (range 0 – 4) and 1. 9 (range 0 – 4), respectively. SNs were identified in 86. 9 % (20 / 23) of patients with early-stage disease and in 80 % (8 / 10) of patients with locall...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{benefits}} of sentinel {{lymph node biopsy}} (SLNB) for breast cancer patients with histologically negative axillary nodes, in whom axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is thereby avoided, are now established. Low false negative rate, certainly with blue dye technique, mostly reflects the established high inherent accuracy of SLNB and low axillary nodal metastatic load (subject to patient selection). SLN identification rate is influenced by volume, injection site and choice of mapping agent, axillary nodal metastatic load, SLN location and skill at axillary dissection. Being more subject to technical failure, SLN identification {{seems to be a}} more reasonable variable for learning curve assessment than false negative rate. Methylene blue is as good an SLN mapping agent as Isosulfan blue and is much cheaper. Addition of <b>radio-colloid</b> mapping to blue dye does not achieve a sufficiently higher identification rate to justify the cost. Methylene blue is therefore the agent of choice for SLN mapping in developing countries. The American Society of Breast Surgeons recommends that, for competence, surgeons should perform 20 SLNB but admits that the learning curve with a standardized technique may be "much shorter". One appropriate remedy for this dilemma is to plot individual learning curves. Methods Using methylene blue dye, experienced breast surgeons performed SLNB in selected patients with breast cancer (primary tumor Results The CUSUM plot crossed the SPRT limit line after 8 consecutive, positively identified SLN, signaling achievement of an acceptable level of competence. Conclusion Tabular CUSUM charting, based on a justified choice of parameters, indicates that the learning curve for SLNB using methylene blue dye is completed after 8 consecutive, positively identified SLN. CUSUM charting may be used to plot individual learning curves for trainee surgeons by applying a proxy parameter for failure {{in the presence of a}} mentor (such as failed SLN identification within 15 minutes). </p...|$|E

Considering all of 889 cases, SLN was localized in the second level in 69 patients (7. 8 %); but if we consider metastatic SLN alone (340 cases), it was in the second level in 23 subjects (6. 8 %). In total, we had a positive second level SLN in 2. 3 % of cases (23 / 889). ConclusionSecond level SLN could be considered only an anomalous lymphatic axillary drainage and it does not linked to particular histological variants of the primitive tumour. In our study, skip metastases were recognized in only 2. 6 % of cases, therefore, whenever a SLN is not isolated for any reason, the first level sampling represent a viable operative choice...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Preoperative {{sentinel}} node mapping {{is routinely}} performed with lymphoscintigraphy, after injection of a <b>radio-colloid.</b> Intraoperatively, sentinel nodes are conventionally pursued with a gamma ray detection probe {{and a blue}} dye. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the added value of intraoperative fluorescence imaging to the radioguided procedure for sentinel nodes located in the groin. For this, the hybrid tracer ICG- 99 mTc nanocol-loid was used, which is both radioactive and fluorescent. Additionally, the feasibility and accuracy of surgical navigation based on preoperatively acquired SPECT/CT images combined with this hybrid tracer was stu-died. Material and methods: Thirty patients scheduled for an inguinal sentinel node procedure were included in this study. After peritumo-ral injection of ICG- 99 mTc nanocolloid, lymphoscinitigraphy and SPECT/CT images were obtained. During surgery, a combination of gamma tracing with a handheld gamma probe and a portable gamma camera to-gether with fluorescence guidance using a fluorescence camera was used to harvest the sentinel nodes. Ad-ditionally, in 10 patients navigation of the handheld gamma probe to the sentinel nodes based on 3 D SPECT/CT images was performed prior to incision in order to evaluate the navigation accuracy. Results: Preoperatively, SPECT/CT was able to identify 18 additional sentinel nodes, next to the [...] . detected sentinel nodes by lymphoscintigraphy. In total, 104 sentinel nodes were excised during surgery, of which merely 55, 8 % had stained blue and 98 % were detected with fluorescence in vivo. In 10 patients, surgical navigation was used during the procedure and the mean error compared with the location indicated by the gamma probe was 5. 4 mm. Conclusion: Inguinal sentinel node bipsy using the hybrid tracer ICG- 99 mTc nanocolloid is feasible in and ishowed to have a superior detectability rate compared to the conventionally used blue dye. ICG- 99 mTc nanocolloid enables the combination of unaltered preoperative sentinel node identification using lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT with an improved bimodal (radioactive and fluorescent) signal for intraoperative sentinel node de-tection. Surgical navigation based on SPECT/CT data combined with this hybrid tracer is feasible and offers a promising perspective for improving the sentinel node procedure in areas of complex and deep lymphatic drainage. ...|$|E
