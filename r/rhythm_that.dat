5|$|Salsa {{music is}} a diverse and {{predominantly}} Caribbean <b>rhythm</b> <b>that</b> is popular in many Latin American countries. Salsa incorporates multiple styles and variations; the term {{can be used to}} describe most any form of the popular Cuban-derived musical genres (like chachachá and mambo). Most specifically however, salsa refers to a particular style was developed by mid-1970s groups of New York City-area Cuban and Puerto Rican immigrants to the United States, and stylistic descendants like 1980s salsa romantica.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the flowing main theme, Khan's leitmotif {{was designed as a}} percussive texture that could be overlaid with other music and emphasized the character's insanity. The seven-note brass theme was echoplexed to emphasize the character's ruminations about the past while on Ceti Alpha V, but does not play fully until Reliants attack on the Enterprise. Many elements drew from Horner's previous work (a <b>rhythm</b> <b>that</b> accompanies Khan's theme during the surprise attack borrows from an attack theme from Wolfen, in turn influenced by Goldsmith's score for Alien). Musical moments from the original television series are also heard during investigation of the Regula space station and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|While {{publishing}} short {{articles on}} the subject earlier in his career (for example the essay De quelques formes primitives de classification written in 1902 with Marcel Mauss), Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 magnum opus The Elementary Forms of Religious Life. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought {{to understand how the}} concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not a priori. Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group's social <b>rhythm</b> <b>that</b> determines our understanding of time. In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of rationalism and empiricism, arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the tabla rasa empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal a priori's (as Kant argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.|$|E

25|$|In this luscious setting—as in Luxe, Calme et Volupté by Henri Matisse—Metzinger {{makes use}} all the colors in the {{spectrum}} of visible light. Unlike Matisse's work, Metzinger's brushstrokes are large, forming a mosaic-like lattice of squares or cubes of similar size and shape throughout, juxtaposed {{in a wide variety}} of angles relative to one another, creating an overall <b>rhythm</b> <b>that</b> would otherwise not be present.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{there were}} two {{sections}} of 16 bars in 2/4 time separated by an instrumental section on the Spanish guitar called the pasacalle. The bolero proved to be exceptionally adaptable, and led to many variants. Typical was the introduction of sychopation leading to the bolero-moruno, bolero-beguine, bolero-mambo, bolero-cha. The bolero-son became for several decades the most popular rhythm for dancing in Cuba, {{and it was this}} <b>rhythm</b> <b>that</b> the international dance community picked up and taught as the wrongly-named 'rumba'.|$|E
25|$|The third {{movement}} is in fast triple time and marked presto, senza battuta. The third {{movement is}} the most technical movement of the entire symphony. The final movement begins with a spiral figure for the strings in free <b>rhythm</b> <b>that</b> is interrupted by the brass section. This leads {{to a set of}} variations and a short fugue. The spiral section returns in the brass and also in the coda, which brings the work to an exciting finish. The final movement lasts approximately nine minutes.|$|E

25|$|The accompaniment becomes {{gradually}} {{thicker and}} louder until the whole orchestra is {{playing at the}} very end. Just before the end (rehearsal number 18 in the score), there is a sudden change of key to E major, though C major is reestablished after just eight bars. Six bars from the end, the bass drum, cymbals and tam-tam make their first entry, and the trombones play raucous glissandi while the whole orchestra beats out the <b>rhythm</b> <b>that</b> has been played on the snare drum {{from the very first}} bar. Finally, the work descends from a dissonant D-flat chord to a C major chord.|$|E
25|$|Working {{extended}} {{hours or}} overnight shifts also poses the added difficulty of requiring performance from an individual at a time with the body is driven to sleep by the circadian system. Sleep, alertness, and cognitive functioning {{are determined by the}} interaction of two processes: the endogenous circadian pacemaker and the homeostatic drive for sleep. The endogenous circadian pacemaker generates the 24-hour circadian <b>rhythm</b> <b>that</b> regulates subjective alertness and sleep propensity as well as core body temperature, cognitive functions, and melatonin secretion, as described above. It is also highly sensitive to light, which is its primary synchronization. Misalignment of the circadian rhythm results in disturbed sleep, impaired performance alertness, waking-hour melatonin secretion, and reduced levels of nocturnal secretion of growth hormone. The outcome, therefore, can range from performance error to long-term health decrements.|$|E
25|$|The Man on a Balcony leans nonchalantly {{against a}} {{balustrade}} occupying the foreground of the composition. At first glance he appears bathed in natural light. But upon close examination {{there is no}} clear light source or direction from which the light emanates, giving the overall work the theatrical feeling of a stage set. Aimed at a wide audience, the models monumental three-dimensional presence 'gazes' at the spectator, while the spectator contemplates the painting in return. Just as in Gleizes' Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon (1911) and Les Baigneuses (The Bathers) of the same year, there is present throughout an interplay of perpendicular lines and hyperbolic arcs that produce a <b>rhythm</b> <b>that</b> permeate the complex urban backdrop; here of smokestacks, train tracks, windows, bridge girders and clouds (the view from the balcony of the doctors office on the avenue de l'Opéra).|$|E

25|$|Rebellion and {{rejection}} are also expressed themes in this story. Bartleby refuses {{to conform to}} the normal ways of the people around him and instead, simply just doesn't complete his tasks requested by his boss. He does not make any request for changes in the workplace, but just continues to be passive to the work happening around him. Just as public rejects changes from a normal routine, this rebellious style by Bartleby causes his co-workers to reject him as he is not behaving the same {{as the rest of the}} work place environment. The narrator tries multiple tactics to get Bartleby {{to conform to the}} standards of the workplace, and ultimately realizes that Bartleby's mental state is not that of normal society. Although the narrator sees Bartleby as a harmless person, the narrator refuses to engage in the same peculiar <b>rhythm</b> <b>that</b> Bartleby is stuck in.|$|E

New Zealand Herald's Lydia Jenkin was more critical, writing that it [...] "sounds like a trying-too-hard version of Lady Gaga meets M.I.A.".
