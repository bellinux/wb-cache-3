Early engineering research in this field, which became generally known as adiabatic computing, focused on the asymptotic energetics of computation, exploring VLSI designs that use reversible logic and adiabatic switching to preserve information and achieve nearly zero power dissipation as operating frequencies approach zero. Recent advances in CMOS VLSI design have taken us to real working chips that rely on controlled charge recovery to operate at substantially lower power dissipation levels than their conventional counterparts. Although their origins {{can be traced back}} to the early adiabatic circuits, these so-called energyrecovering systems approach charge recycling from a more practical angle, achieving operating frequencies in the hundreds of MHz with relatively low overhead. Among other energy recovering designs, researchers in the field have demonstrated microcontrollers, standard-cell ASICs, SRAMs, LCD panel drivers, I/O drivers, and multi-GHz clock networks.

These efficiency gains, measured using changes in threshold and loudness, occur at a wide range of pulse rates, including those commonly used in current CI systems. In monopolar mode, dynamic ranges are larger for PS and for long-IPG pulse shapes than for BI pulses, but this increase in DR is not accompanied by a higher number of discriminable loudness steps, and hence, in a better coding of loudness. Moreover, waveforms with relatively short and long interphase gaps do not yield different patterns of excitation despite the relatively large differences in threshold. Two important findings are that, contrary to data obtained in animal experiments, anodic currents are more effective than cathodic stimulation for human CI patients and that the thresholds decrease with increases in IPG over a much longer time course (more than 3 ms) than for animals. In this review it is discussed how these alternative pulse shapes may be beneficial in terms of reducing power consumption and channel interactions, which issues remain to be addressed, and how models contribute to guiding our research...|$|R
