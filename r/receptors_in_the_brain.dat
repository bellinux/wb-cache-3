5|$|Several {{dopamine}} agonists {{that bind}} to dopamine <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially {{used as a}} complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD {{with the aim of}} delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., the number of <b>receptors)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> This decline has been shown to occur in the striatum and extrastriatal regions.C]DOPA |journal=Life Sciences |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=730–736 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2006.02.017 |pmid=16580023 }} Decreases in the D1, D2, and D3 receptors are well documented. The reduction of dopamine with aging is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E
5|$|Some {{users of}} the drug {{consider}} it an entheogen and a tool to supplement practices for transcendence, including meditation and psychonautics. The intensity and duration {{of the effects of}} psilocybin are variable, depending on species or cultivar of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and set and setting, as was shown in experiments led by Timothy Leary at Harvard University in the early 1960s. Once ingested, psilocybin is rapidly metabolized to psilocin, which then acts on serotonin <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> The mind-altering effects of psilocybin typically last from two to six hours, although to individuals under the influence of psilocybin, the effects may seem to last much longer, since the drug can distort the perception of time. Psilocybin has a low toxicity and a relatively low harm potential, and reports of lethal doses of the drug are rare. Several modern bioanalytical methods have been adapted to rapidly and accurately screen the levels of psilocybin in mushroom samples and body fluids. Since the 1990s, there has been a renewal of scientific research into the potential medical and psychological therapeutic benefits of psilocybin for treating conditions including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety, treatment-resistant depression, cluster headaches, and anxiety related to terminal cancer. Possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries, and it has been classified as a scheduled drug by many national drug laws.|$|E

25|$|Evidence for {{an effect}} of AVP on monogamy vs {{promiscuity}} comes from experimental studies in several species, which indicate that the precise distribution of vasopressin and vasopressin <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> is associated with species-typical patterns of social behavior. In particular, there are consistent differences between monogamous species and promiscuous species {{in the distribution of}} AVP receptors, and sometimes in the distribution of vasopressin-containing axons, even when closely related species are compared.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{secretion}} {{of stress}} hormones, glucocorticoids (GCs) and catecholamines (CAs), {{as a result}} of disease, may reduce the effect of neurotransmitters, including serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, or other <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones. Under stimulation, norepinephrine is released from the sympathetic nerve terminals in organs, and the target immune cells express adrenoreceptors. Through stimulation of these receptors, locally released norepinephrine, or circulating catecholamines such as epinephrine, affect lymphocyte traffic, circulation, and proliferation, and modulate cytokine production and the functional activity of different lymphoid cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} is a brief table of notable drugs and their primary neurotransmitter, receptor or method of action. It {{should be noted that}} many drugs act on more than one transmitter or <b>receptor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|R
25|$|Estrogen {{has been}} found to {{increase}} the secretion of oxytocin and to increase the expression of its <b>receptor,</b> <b>the</b> oxytocin <b>receptor,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> <b>In</b> women, a single dose of estradiol {{has been found}} to be sufficient to increase circulating oxytocin concentrations.|$|R
50|$|Neonicotinoids are {{especially}} {{likely to cause}} cumulative effects on bees due to their mechanism of function as this pesticide group works by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of <b>the</b> insects, and such receptors are particularly abundant in bees. Over-accumulation of acetylcholine results in paralysis and death.|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} of these specialized cannabinoid <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> led researchers {{to the discovery of}} endocannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glyceride (2-AG). THC targets receptors in a manner far less selective than endocannabinoid molecules released during retrograde signaling, as the drug has a relatively low cannabinoid receptor efficacy and affinity. In populations of low cannabinoid receptor density, THC may act to antagonize endogenous agonists that possess greater receptor efficacy. THC is a lipophilic molecule and may bind non-specifically to a variety of entities in the brain and body, such as adipose tissue (fat).|$|E
25|$|Baclofen is {{considered}} to be at least as effective as diazepam in reducing spasticity, and causes much less sedation. It acts as a GABA agonist at GABAB <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and spinal cord, resulting in hyperpolarization of neurons expressing this receptor, most likely due to increased potassium ion conductance. Baclofen also inhibits neural function presynaptically, by reducing calcium ion influx, and thereby reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in both the brain and spinal cord. It may also reduce pain in patients by inhibiting the release of substance P in the spinal cord, as well.|$|E
25|$|Memantine {{acts as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} {{at different}} neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at potencies possibly similar to the NMDA and 5-HT3 receptors, but this is difficult to ascertain with accuracy because of the rapid desensitization of nAChR responses in these experiments. It can be noted that memantine is an antagonist at Alpha-7 nAChR, which may contribute to initial worsening of cognitive function during early memantine treatment. Alpha-7 nAChR upregulates quickly in response to antagonism, which could explain the cognitive-enhancing effects of chronic memantine treatment. It {{has been shown that}} the number of nicotinic <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> are reduced in Alzheimer's disease, {{even in the absence of}} a general decrease in the number of neurons, and nicotinic receptor agonists are viewed as interesting targets for anti-Alzheimer drugs.|$|E

25|$|Morphine is {{a highly}} {{addictive}} substance. In controlled studies comparing the physiological and subjective effects of heroin and morphine in individuals formerly addicted to opiates, subjects showed no preference for one drug over the other. Equipotent, injected doses had comparable action courses, with no difference in subjects' self-rated feelings of euphoria, ambition, nervousness, relaxation, drowsiness, or sleepiness. Short-term addiction studies by the same researchers demonstrated that tolerance developed at a similar rate to both heroin and morphine. When compared to the opioids hydromorphone, fentanyl, oxycodone, and pethidine/meperidine, former addicts showed a strong preference for heroin and morphine, suggesting that heroin and morphine are particularly susceptible to abuse and addiction. Morphine and heroin were also {{much more likely to}} produce euphoria and other positive subjective effects when compared to these other opioids. The choice of heroin and morphine over other opioids by former drug addicts may also be because heroin (also known as morphine diacetate, diamorphine, or diacetyl morphine) is an ester of morphine and a morphine prodrug, essentially meaning they are identical drugs in vivo. Heroin is converted to morphine before binding to the opioid <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and spinal cord, where morphine causes the subjective effects, which is what the addicted individuals are seeking.|$|E
25|$|It is long acting, lipophilic, and metabolised hepatically by {{oxidative}} pathways. It acts on benzodiazepine <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> {{which are}} associated with the GABA receptors, causing an enhanced binding of GABA to GABAA receptors. GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, involved in inducing sleepiness, muscular relaxation, and control of anxiety and seizures, and slows down the central nervous system. The mechanism of action of nitrazepam is the same as other benzodiazepine drugs and zopiclone. The anticonvulsant properties of nitrazepam and other benzodiazepines may be in part or entirely due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors. Sustained repetitive firing seems to be limited by benzodiazepines effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation in mouse spinal cord cell cultures. The muscle relaxant properties of nitrazepam are produced via inhibition of polysynaptic pathways in the spinal cord of decerebrate cats. It is a full agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor. The endogenous opioid system {{may play a role in}} some of the pharmacological properties of nitrazepam in rats. Nitrazepam causes a decrease in the cerebral contents of the amino acids glycine and alanine in the mouse brain. The decrease may be due to activation of benzodiazepine receptors. At high doses decreases in histamine turnover occur as a result of nitrazepam's action at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex in mouse brain. Nitrazepam has demonstrated cortisol-suppressing properties in humans.|$|E
500|$|The {{dopamine}} system plays {{a crucial}} role in several aspects of addiction. [...] At the earliest stage, genetic differences that alter the expression of dopamine <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> can predict whether a person will find stimulants appealing or aversive. [...] Consumption of stimulants produces increases in brain dopamine levels that last from minutes to hours. [...] Finally, the chronic elevation in dopamine that comes with repetitive high-dose stimulant consumption triggers a wide-ranging set of structural changes in the brain that are responsible for the behavioral abnormalities which characterize an addiction. Treatment of stimulant addiction is very difficult, because even if consumption ceases, the craving that comes with psychological withdrawal does not. Even when the craving seems to be extinct, it may re-emerge when faced with stimuli that are associated with the drug, such as friends, locations and situations. Association networks in the brain are greatly interlinked.|$|E
5000|$|In medical settings, NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists {{are used}} as anesthetics, so GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators are used to effectively prevent any neurotoxicity caused by them. [...] Drugs that work to suppress NAN include anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and agonists at <b>the</b> alpha-2 adrenergic <b>receptor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> such as clonidine.Conversely, coadministration of NMDA-antagonists with alpha-2 adrenergic antagonists, like yohimbine could theoretically potentiate NAN.|$|R

50|$|AMPA, {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} <b>receptor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> mediates long term potentiation via activity-dependent modulation of AMPA density.

2500|$|Partly {{because of}} its muscle-activating function, but also {{because of its}} {{functions}} in the autonomic nervous system and brain, a large number of important drugs exert their effects by altering cholinergic transmission. [...] Numerous venoms and toxins produced by plants, animals, and bacteria, as well as chemical nerve agents such as Sarin, cause harm by inactivating or hyperactivating muscles via their influences on the neuromuscular junction. Drugs that act on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, such as atropine, can be poisonous in large quantities, but in smaller doses they are commonly used to treat certain heart conditions and eye problems. [...] Scopolamine, which acts mainly on muscarinic <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> can cause delirium and amnesia. The addictive qualities of nicotine are derived from its effects on nicotinic acetylcholine <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Clonidine treats {{high blood}} {{pressure}} by stimulating α2 <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> which decreases peripheral vascular resistance, lowering blood pressure.

2500|$|Opiates {{contain the}} {{narcotics}} morphine, codeine, and papaverine which provide pain relief. Opiates activate μ-opioid <b>receptors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> which alter the brain's perception of sensory input, alleviating pain and sometimes inducing pleasure {{for a short}} time period. When intravenously administered, opiates can relieve neuropathic pain but only for a time between 4 and 24 hours. After this time window, the pain returns and the patient must be treated again. Although this method of treatment has been proven to reduce pain, the repetitive use of opiates has also been linked to the activation of the brain's reward system and therefore poses a threat of addiction. Heavy doses of opiates can also cause constipation, and respiratory depression. [...] More common side effects include light-headedness, dizziness, sedation, itching, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. [...] The potential destruction opiates can cause have drawn many doctors and patients away from their use.|$|E
