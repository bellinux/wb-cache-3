5|$|Mickiewicz and {{his family}} lived in <b>relative</b> <b>poverty,</b> their major source of income being {{occasional}} publication of his work – not a very profitable endeavor. They received support from friends and patrons, {{but not enough to}} substantially change their situation. Despite spending most of his remaining years in France, Mickiewicz would never receive French citizenship, nor any support from the French government. By the late 1830s he was less active as a writer, and also less visible on the Polish émigré political scene.|$|E
40|$|Although <b>relative</b> income <b>poverty</b> rates {{vary from}} year to year, the rankings of {{different}} industrialised countries according to these poverty measures tend to be rather stable. Ireland is consistently {{among a group of}} countries with <b>relative</b> income <b>poverty</b> rates considerably above the European Union average (though not as high as the USA). This has not changed over the course of Ireland’s recent economic boom, since our <b>relative</b> income <b>poverty</b> rates themselves have not fallen – indeed they have generally risen – over that period. This study asks why Ireland has higher <b>relative</b> income <b>poverty</b> rates than many of our EU partners? More specifically, it explores what we can learn from an in-depth comparison with a number of other European countries, including some of the best performers in the European Union in terms of that indicator...|$|R

40|$|Early {{international}} {{comparisons of}} child well-being {{have tended to}} use <b>relative</b> child income <b>poverty</b> rates. There are reasons to doubt {{the reliability of the}} <b>relative</b> child income <b>poverty</b> rate especially in comparative analysis. This chapter therefore explores the relationship between the <b>relative</b> income child <b>poverty</b> rate and the multi-dimensional index of child well-being developed in the UNICEF Innocenti Report Card 11. It finds that the material domain which includes the <b>relative</b> child income <b>poverty</b> rates is associated with all the other five domains of child well-being and also with overall well-being even when the material domain is excluded. Two indicators of child deprivation in the material domain are most closely associated with overall well-being. But the third most closely associated indicator is the <b>relative</b> child <b>poverty</b> rate. This is a remarkable finding given that the child income poverty rate is a relative indicator with very different levels in different countries. It suggests that child well-being may itself be driven partly or mainly by relativities in a society rather than absolute and objective conditions...|$|R

As a result, Robinson joined a neighborhood gang, but his friend Carl Anderson persuaded him to abandon it.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} {{of those involved in}} the revolt of 1381 were not represented in Parliament and were excluded from its decision-making. In a few cases the rebels were led or joined by relatively prosperous members of the gentry, such as Sir Roger Bacon in Norfolk. Some of them later claimed to have been forced to join the revolt by the rebels. Clergy also formed part of the revolt; as well as the more prominent leaders, such as John Ball or John Wrawe, nearly 20 are mentioned in the records of the revolt in the south-east. Some were pursuing local grievances, some were disadvantaged and suffering <b>relative</b> <b>poverty,</b> and others appear to have been motivated by strong radical beliefs.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{surviving}} {{records of}} Blackstone's undergraduate term at Oxford, but the curriculum of Pembroke College {{had been set}} out in 1624, and Prest notes that it was probably still followed in 1738, so Blackstone would have studied Greek, science, logic, rhetoric, philosophy, mathematics, geography and poetry. Blackstone was particularly good at Greek, mathematics and poetry, with his notes on William Shakespeare being included in George Steevens' 1781 edition of Shakespeare's plays. Many of Blackstone's undergraduate texts survive, and they include few legal texts, instead being wide-ranging; politics, current affairs, poetry, geometry and controversial theological texts. The last element is understandable, given his family's theological interests, but the more surprising element is {{the sheer number of}} texts he owned given his <b>relative</b> <b>poverty</b> as a student.|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to introduce a}} new method to measure <b>relative</b> income <b>poverty.</b> The aim {{is to find a}} solution which will combine information both on the depth of poverty and the quantity of the poor, i. e. the number of people living in poverty. Furthermore, a yardstick is sought which would be relatively simple and easy to understand, as these properties would facilitate the use of the new method in sociological poverty research and political decision making. The paper begins by discussing the most common problems in measuring social exclusion and <b>relative</b> income <b>poverty.</b> The following sections focus on poverty alleviation policies and poverty measurement practices, as well as on different poverty indices and the properties of an ideal poverty measure. Next, our innovation is presented, the cumulative poverty index (CUPI), together with a section discussing the estimations of the new index. The properties of the CUPI are analysed by comparing it to a number of commonly used poverty and inequality measures. Before introducing conclusions, poverty trends are compared and simulations calculated to test the CUPI against the most common <b>relative</b> income <b>poverty</b> measures...|$|R

5|$|Aged six, Castro, {{along with}} his elder {{siblings}} Ramón and Angela, was sent {{to live with their}} teacher in Santiago de Cuba, dwelling in cramped conditions and <b>relative</b> <b>poverty,</b> often failing to have enough to eat because of their tutor's poor economic situation. Aged eight, Castro was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, although later became an atheist. Being baptized enabled Castro to attend the La Salle boarding school in Santiago, where he regularly misbehaved, and so was sent to the privately funded, Jesuit-run Dolores School in Santiago. In 1945 he transferred to the more prestigious Jesuit-run El Colegio de Belén in Havana. Although Castro took an interest in history, geography and debating at Belén, he did not excel academically, instead devoting much of his time to playing sport.|$|E
5|$|Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, Rowling {{was working}} as a {{researcher}} and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband and <b>relative</b> <b>poverty</b> until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. There were six sequels, of which the last, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written four books for adult readers: The Casual Vacancy (2012) and—under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith—the crime fiction novels The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), The Silkworm (2014) and Career of Evil (2015).|$|E
5|$|Caspar David Friedrich {{was born}} on 5 September 1774, in Greifswald, Swedish Pomerania, on the Baltic coast of Germany. The sixth of ten children, he {{was brought up in}} the strict Lutheran creed of his father Adolf Gottlieb Friedrich, a candle-maker and soap boiler. Records of the family's {{financial}} circumstances are contradictory; while some sources indicate the children were privately tutored, others record that they were raised in <b>relative</b> <b>poverty.</b> Caspar David was familiar with death from an early age. His mother, Sophie Dorothea Bechly, died in 1781 when he was just seven. A year later, his sister Elisabeth died, while a second sister, Maria, succumbed to typhus in 1791. Arguably the greatest tragedy of his childhood happened in 1787 when his brother Johann Christoffer died: at the age of thirteen, Caspar David witnessed his younger brother fall through the ice of a frozen lake, and drown. Some accounts suggest that Johann Christoffer perished while trying to rescue Caspar David, who was also in danger on the ice.|$|E

5|$|Wright's career {{came to an}} end in 1688 {{with the}} {{expulsion}} of King James II during the Glorious Revolution. He seems to have accepted the inevitable end of his royal favour with the accession to the throne of the Protestant William of Orange. He lived on, in <b>relative</b> <b>poverty,</b> for a further six years until 1694. In March of that year, he made a will leaving his house in St Paul's parish to his niece Katherine Vaux. His collection of drawings, prints and books were left to his nephew, the painter Michael Wright; however a codicil to the will stated that the books were to be sold on behalf of his son Thomas, who was then abroad. The books were auctioned on 4 June and on 1 August 1694, John Michael Wright was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields.|$|E
5|$|The Crown was at {{the centre}} of {{government}} in late medieval Scotland. The unification of the kingdom, the spread of Anglo-Norman custom, {{the development of a}} European trading economy and Robert I's success in achieving independence from England, all did much to build up the prestige of the institution. However, its authority within the kingdom was not unchallenged, not least from the many semi-independent lordships and it endured a series of crisis, particularly frequent minorities and resulting regencies. All of this, in addition to the <b>relative</b> <b>poverty</b> of the kingdom and the lack of a system of regular taxation, helped to limit the scale of central administration and government. Much more than the English monarchy, the Scottish court remained a largely itinerant institution, with the king moving between royal castles, particularly Perth and Stirling, but also holding judicial sessions throughout the kingdom, with Edinburgh only beginning to emerge as the capital in the reign of James III at the cost of considerable unpopularity. Like most western European monarchies, the Scottish Crown in the 15th century adopted the example of the Burgundian court, through formality and elegance putting itself at the centre of culture and political life, defined with display, ritual and pageantry, reflected in elaborate new palaces and patronage of the arts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Relative</b> <b>poverty</b> views poverty as {{socially}} {{defined and}} dependent on social context, hence <b>relative</b> <b>poverty</b> {{is a measure}} of income inequality. Usually, <b>relative</b> <b>poverty</b> is measured as the percentage of the population with income less than some fixed proportion of median income. There are several other different income inequality metrics, for example, the Gini coefficient or the Theil Index.|$|E
50|$|When measured, poverty may be {{absolute}} or <b>relative.</b> Absolute <b>poverty</b> {{refers to}} a set standard which is consistent over time and between countries.

This paper explores {{the extent to which}} these measures represent international variation in child well-being using an index that we have developed. The conclusions are that: <b>relative</b> income <b>poverty</b> and worklessnss are poor indcators of child well-being especially for some of the new EU countries; deprivation has a stronger association with overall well-being than <b>relative</b> income <b>poverty</b> or worklessness; there are a number of other single indicators of child well-being that could be used as proxies for overall child well-being; but the EU (and the UK) could easily develop its own index of child well-being...|$|R
40|$|This paper tracks {{changes in}} {{relative}} centralisation and <b>relative</b> concentration of <b>poverty</b> for the 25 largest British cities, analysing change for poor and non-poor groups separately, and examining parallel changes in spatial segregation. The paper confirms that poverty is suburbanising, {{at least in}} the larger cities, although poverty remains over-represented in inner locations. Suburbanisation is occurring through both the reduction in low income populations in inner locations and the growth non-poor groups in these places, consistent with a process of displacement. <b>Relative</b> centralisation of <b>poverty</b> has fallen more stronglythan <b>relative</b> concentration of <b>poverty,</b> as the outward shift of poorer groups leaves them still living in denser neighbourhoods on average. The paper also shows that spatial segregation (unevenness) declined at the same time although {{it remains to be seen}} whether this indicates a long-term shift to less segregated urban forms or a transitional outcome before new forms of segregation emerge around suburban poverty concentrations...|$|R
