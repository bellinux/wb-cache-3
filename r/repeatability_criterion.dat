40|$|Abstract—The {{accuracy}} {{evaluation of}} image feature detectors is done using the <b>repeatability</b> <b>criterion.</b> Therefore, a wellknown data set consisting of image sequences and homography matrices is processed. This data serves as ground truth mapping {{information for the}} evaluation and is used in many computer vision papers. An accuracy validation of the benchmarks has not been done so far and is provided in this work. The accuracy is limited and evaluations of feature detectors may result in erroneous conclusions. Using a differential evolution approach for the optimization of a new, feature-independent cost function, {{the accuracy of the}} ground truth homographies is increased. The results are validated using comparisons between the repeatability rates before and after the proposed optimization. The new homographies provide better repeatability results for each detector.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Spirometry is an {{apparently}} simple test, yet the recommended criteria for ac-ceptability and reproducibility {{can be difficult}} to fulfill. This study aimed (1) to prospectively assess the number of tests that meet the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) 2005 acceptability and <b>repeatability</b> <b>criteria</b> in the routine practice of an experienced technician at a referral hospital’s lung function laboratory, (2) to identify the most common errors, and (3) to explore patient characteristics possibly associated with failure to meet standards. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 257 consecutive spirometries supervised by the same technician, who gave priority to achieving a minimum of 3 correct maneuvers within a maximum of 8 attempts. We recorded FVC, FEV 1, expiratory time (TE), back-extrapolated volume (VE), end-of-test volume (VEOT), number of maneuvers with and without errors, and errors (VE> 0. 15 L or 5 % of FVC, TE 0. 025 L for> 1 s). RESULTS: Two-hundred and fifteen spirometries (83. 7 %, 95 % CI 78. 6 – 87. 7 %) met the ATS/ERS 2005 criteria. Acceptability criteria were met in 73. 9 % (95 % CI 71. 2 – 76. 3 %) of the maneuvers and <b>repeatability</b> <b>criteria</b> in 90. 7 % (95 % CI 86. 5 – 93. 6 %). A mean SD of 3. 3 1. 4 per subject was acceptable, and a mean SD of 4. 5 1. 9 was obtained. TE and VEOT errors were the most common. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 15 % of the subjects failed to fulfill all the ATS/ERS 2005 criteria for spirometry performed even though they were coached by a qualified and regularly trained technician in a hospital lung function laboratory. The fact that the ATS/ERS 2005 criteria cannot be met by all patients in optimal technical conditions should be further considered and explored.

40|$|This paper investigates {{segmentation}} based interest {{points for}} matching and recognition. We propose two simple methods for extracting features from the segmentation maps, which {{focus on the}} boundaries and centres of {{the gravity of the}} segments. In addition, this can be considered a novel approach for evaluating unsupervised image segmentation algorithms. Former evaluations aim at estimating segmentation quality by how well resulting segments adhere to the contours separating ground-truth foregrounds from backgrounds and therefore explicitly focus on particular objects of interest. In contrast, we propose to measure the robustness of segmentations by the repeatability of features extracted from segments on images related by various geometric and photometric transformations. Further, our evaluation provides a new insight into suitability of the segmentation methods for generating local features for image retrieval or recognition. Several segmentation methods are evaluated and compared to state-of-the art interest point detectors using the <b>repeatability</b> <b>criteria</b> as well as standard matching and recognition benchmarks. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work presents an algorithm for automated extraction of multi-scale interest points in multispectral and hyperspectral images. Interest points are {{features of the}} image that capture information from its neighbors and are distinctive and stable under transformations such as translation and rotation. They have been applied to diverse problems in computer vision, including image matching, recognition, registration, and change detection. Interest-point operators for monochromatic images were proposed {{more than a decade}} ago and have since been studied extensively. An interest operator seeks out points in an image that are structurally distinct, invariant to imaging conditions, stable under geometric transformation, and interpretable. The approach that is presented in this work combines and extends ideas from Lowe’s interest point operator that uses local extrema of Difference of Gaussian (DoG) function at multiple scales. A modification to Lowe’s approach for vector images is proposed. The multiscale representation of the image is generated by vector anisotropic diffusion that should leads to improve detection since it better preserve edges in the image. In addition, a vectorial approach of this operator is proposed to manage multispectral and hyperspectral images, experiments with multispectral and hyperspectral images are presented, and an evaluation of interest points found by our approach based on <b>repeatability</b> <b>criterion</b> and image registration is carried out...|$|E
40|$|The {{repeatability}} {{and efficiency}} of a corner detector determines how likely {{it is to be}} useful in a real-world application. The repeatability is importand because the same scene viewed from different positions should yield features which correspond to the same real-world 3 D locations [Schmid et al 2000]. The efficiency is important because this determines whether the detector combined with further processing can operate at frame rate. Three advances are described in this paper. First, we present a new heuristic for feature detection, and using machine learning we derive a feature detector from this which can fully process live PAL video using less than 5 % of the available processing time. By comparison, most other detectors cannot even operate at frame rate (Harris detector 115 %, SIFT 195 %). Second, we generalize the detector, allowing it to be optimized for repeatability, with little loss of efficiency. Third, we carry out a rigorous comparison of corner detectors based on the above <b>repeatability</b> <b>criterion</b> applied to 3 D scenes. We show that despite being principally constructed for speed, on these stringent tests, our heuristic detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors. Finally, the comparison demonstrates that using machine learning produces significant improvements in repeatability, yielding a detector that is both very fast and very high quality.

40|$|The {{detection}} of scale invariant image features is a fun-damental task for computer vision applications like object recognition or re-identification. Features are localized by computing extrema of the gradients in the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) scale space. The most popular detector for scale invariant features is the SIFT detector which uses the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) pyramid as an approx-imation of the LoG. Recently, the alternative interest point (ALP) detector demonstrated its strength in fast computa-tion on highly parallel architectures like the GPU. It uses the LoG scale space representation for the localization of interest points. This paper evaluates the localization accu-racy of ALP {{in comparison to}} SIFT. By using synthetic images, it is demonstrated that both localization approaches show a systematic error which {{is dependent on the}} subpixel position of the feature. The error increases with the scale of the detected feature. However, using the LoG instead of the DoG representation reduces the maximum systematic error by 77 %. For the evaluation with natural images, benchmark data sets are used. The <b>repeatability</b> <b>criterion</b> evaluates the accuracy of the detec-tors. The LoG based detector results in up to 16 % higher repeatability. The comparisons are completed with a ref-erence feature localization which uses a signal based ap-proach for the gradient approximation. Based on this ap-proach, a new feature selection criterion is proposed. 1...|$|E

40|$|Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of {{important}} infrastructures such as Portland cement concrete pavements {{plays a key}} role in pioneer societies, to guarantee the optimum usability and performance of the infrastructure system. As an example, this is imperative to appraise the destruction level in Portland cement concrete pavements along time as to plan their maintenance with proper actions at the right time. Based on this premise, the goal of this study is to extend an extensive feasibility study to set up a novel approach for SHM of Portland cement concrete pavements and remaining life estimation, based on self-sensing concrete-CNTs sensors added with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The concrete-CNTs sensors are applied as piezoresistive sensors (i. e. to collect information such as weight and species of passing vehicles), or as destruction identification sensors (i. e. to detect crack propagation in the Portland cement concrete pavement). For casting the concrete-CNTs sensors, some parameters are important, such as the number of CNTs, species of surfactant, dispersion quality etc. In this research, the dispersion quality of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the aqueous phase and cement matrix was experiment examined using Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrophotometry (UV-VIS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and mechanical experiments for compressive and flexural strength. The outcomes demonstrated that a new specific surfactant composition (sodiumdodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDS) and superplasticizer carboxylate base (SP-C) with the ratio of 1 : 9 respectively) could disperse MWCNTs around 64 % more than other surfactant combinations indicated in the previous studies while this has enough compatibility with the concrete to omit antifoam in the mixing process and maintain the concrete mechanical specifications pretty constant. To appraise the influences of the main parameters affecting concrete-CNTs sensors function, diverse criteria in static and dynamic loading patterns were defined such as sensitivity of the sensor (Se), the standard deviation of the prediction error, repeatability (Re), cross-correlation (CC) and hysteresis (SSE). The dynamic criteria such as sensitivity, internal repeatability, cross-correlation and hysteresis declared that the dispersion energy levels for the dispersion of MWCNTs have a major impact on enhancing the function of the sensor rather than the number of CNTs. The <b>repeatability</b> <b>criterion,</b> contrariwise, showed that the number of MWCNTs has a major impact on the function of the sensor compared to the dispersion quality (dispersion energy level) of MWCNTs. Consequently, both parameters have to be regarded as relevant. The overall outcomes showed that the sensors fabricated with 0. 15 wt% CNTs, superplasticizer and SDS as a surfactant using the maximum dispersion energy level (ultrasonic bath for 2 hours and 90 minutes of ultrasonic probing) have the best function in both static and dynamic load mode. To explore the influences of traffic loads on the pavement, concrete-CNTs sensors were experiment examined under various value of dynamic loads. The outcomes demonstrated that the maximum exterior load applied on the sensor (Fmax) is linearly correlated to the maximum response of the sensor (Smax) via a constant coefficient tagα/tagβ, in which tagα is defined as the slope of the Force vs. Time graph and tagβ is defined as the slope of the Sensor's response vs. Time curve. So, this can be concluded that the application of the indicated concrete-CNTs sensors for piezoresistive applications is feasible and the sensors can appraise the load with of high-goodness of fit (R 2 adj. > 0. 99). In addition, to study the response of the concrete-CNTs sensor under the traffic loading, fatigue experiments were run. An alternative data processing log(G) -log(N) was applied instead of traditional S-log(N) fatigue graphs (Goodman curves), based on the electrical sensor response with a linear regression approach and the outcomes were verified by statistical tests. In this research, the concept of G has been defined for the first time as the slope of a sensor's response that reflects the destruction created in a pavement because of one pass of vehicle load. Based on these findings, two various types of remaining life models for Portland cement concrete pavements were proposed...|$|E

Currently there is no fully validated cough-specific QOL measure for paediatrics. The objective {{of this study was}} to validate a cough-specific QOL questionnaire for paediatric use. Method 43 children (28 males, 15 females; median age 29  months, IQR 20 – 41  months) newly referred for chronic cough participated. One parent of each child completed the 27 -item Parent Cough-Specific QOL questionnaire (PC-QOL), and the generic child (Pediatric QOL Inventory 4. 0 (PedsQL)) and parent QOL questionnaires (SF- 12) and two cough-related measures (visual analogue score and verbal category descriptive score) on two occasions separated by 2 – 3  weeks. Cough counts were also objectively measured on both occasions. Results Internal consistency for both the domains and total PC-QOL at both test times was excellent (Cronbach alpha range 0. 70 – 0. 97). Evidence for <b>repeatability</b> and <b>criterion</b> validity was established, with significant correlations over time and significant relationships with the cough measures.

Currently, there is no validated children's acute cough-specific QoL questionnaire. Objective The objective {{of this study was}} to develop and validate the Parent-proxy Children's Acute Cough-specific QoL Questionnaire (PAC-QoL). Methods Using focus groups, a 48 -item PAC-QoL questionnaire was developed and later reduced to 16 items by using the clinical impact method. Parents of children with a current acute cough (< 2 weeks) at enrollment completed 2 validated cough score measures, the preliminary 48 -item PAC-QoL, and 3 other questionnaires (the State Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI], the Short-Form 8 -item 24 -hour recall Health Survey [SF- 8], and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress 21 -item Scale [DASS 21]). All measures were repeated on days 3 and 14. Results The median age of the 155 children enrolled was 2. 3 years (interquartile range, 1. 3 - 4. 6). Median cough duration at enrollment was 3 days (interquartile range, 2 - 5). The reduced 16 -item scale had high internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0. 95). Evidence for <b>repeatability</b> and <b>criterion</b> validity was shown by significant correlations between the domains and total PAC-QoL scores and the SF- 8 (r = − 0. 36 and − 0. 51), STAI (r = − 0. 27 and − 0. 39), and DASS 21 (r = − 0. 32 and − 0. 41) scales on days 0 and 3, respectively.

Cotes Transit time indices derived from forced expiratory spirograms: repeatability and crite-ria for curve selection and truncation. D. J. Chinn, J. E. Cotes. ERS Journals Ltd 1994. ABSTRACT: Transit time analysis applied to spirograms truncated {{with respect to}} volume, not time, could be informative in population surveys. The present paper asks the questions: How does averaging several forced expirations affect the with-in subject variability {{at different levels of}} truncation? If only one spirogram is analysed, how should it be chosen? Are the results likely to be influenced by prior bronchodilatation? The subjects were 46 men, selected by stratified random sampling from a ship-yard population. Spirograms were obtained in quintuplicate, on two occasions, an average of nine days apart. Using the three "best " spirograms, transit time indices were calculated from averaged moments and from single curves selected in eight different ways; the analyses were performed on complete expirations, and after truncation by volume at levels between 75 – 99 % of forced vital capacity (FVC), and by time (at 6 s). Indices from averaged moments were found to be more reproducible and yield-ed higher intra-class correlations than indices from single curves. Of the latter, the curve selected as having the largest forced vital capacity also yielded acceptable results. Prior inhalation of a bronchodilator aerosol did not reduce the variability. The averaging procedure is recommended for respiratory surveys of working men. For this application, the optimal level of truncation appeared to be by vol-ume at 90 % FVC, but on theoretical grounds truncation at 75 and 99 % of FVC could also be informative...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{performance}} analysis, {{in terms of}} accuracy, linearity, and <b>repeatability,</b> of three <b>criteria</b> to estimate the time of flight in time-domain reflectometry (TDR) signals is carried out. In a first set of experiments, the three criteria [referred to as maximum derivative (MD), zero derivative, and tangent crossing (TC) ] are applied to TDR signals propagating along a set of coaxial cables, with different known lengths and known electrical parameters. In {{a second set of}} experiments, the same criteria are applied to biwire cables in air, with different known lengths and unknown electrical parameters. Finally, in the last set of experiments, the criteria are applied in a more complex situation, i. e., on a biwire used as a sensing element for water-level measurement. The results show that, among the tested criteria, TC appears to provide a very good performance in terms of systematic errors and superior performance in terms of repeatability. The popular MD criterion appears to be more prone to random errors due to noise and TDR artifacts.

A promising approach to provoke cardiovascular stress while facilitating task-specific exercise in people with disabilities is feedback-controlled robot-assisted end-effector-based stair climbing (RASC). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the feasibility, reliability, and repeatability of augmented RASC-based CPET in able-bodied subjects, with a view towards future research and applications in neurologically impaired populations. Twenty able-bodied subjects performed a familiarisation session and 2 consecutive incremental CPETs using augmented RASC. Outcome measures focussed on standard cardiopulmonary performance parameters and on accuracy of work rate tracking (RMSEP-root mean square error). Criteria for feasibility were cardiopulmonary responsiveness and technical implementation. Relative and absolute test-retest reliability were assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), standard error of the measurement (SEM), and minimal detectable change (MDC). Mean differences, limits of agreement, and coefficients of variation (CoV) were estimated to assess <b>repeatability.</b> All <b>criteria</b> for feasibility were achieved. Mean V'O 2 peak was 106 ± 9 % of predicted V'O 2 max and mean HRpeak was 99 ± 3 % of predicted HRmax. 95 % of the subjects achieved at least 1 criterion for V'O 2 max, and the detection of the sub-maximal ventilatory thresholds was successful (ventilatory anaerobic threshold 100 %, respiratory compensation point 90 % of the subjects). Excellent reliability was found for peak cardiopulmonary outcome measures (ICC ≥ 0. 890, SEM ≤ 0. 60 %, MDC ≤ 1. 67 %). Repeatability for the primary outcomes was good (CoV ≤ 0. 12). RASC-based CPET with feedback-guided exercise intensity demonstrated comparable or higher peak cardiopulmonary performance variables relative to predicted values, achieved the criteria for V'O 2 max, and allowed determination of sub-maximal ventilatory thresholds. The reliability and repeatability were found to be high. There is potential for augmented RASC to be used for exercise testing and prescription in populations with neurological impairments who would benefit from repetitive task-specific training...|$|R

This dissertation presents a new and practical method of adult age estimation with successful tests of its validity and <b>repeatability.</b> Six qualitative <b>criteria</b> evident in oral radiographs were developed from 37 subjects represented on three occasions each. Age was estimated from averaged criterion scores by reduced major axis (Model II) regression incorporating longitudinal information for prediction with cross-sectional data. Spearman correlation of scores to known age was r [subscript] s = 0. 82, for 45 subjects aged 17 to 86 years in an independent test set. Mean error of estimated age was 0. 08 years (SD 8. 3 years). In contrast, longitudinal premolar pulp chamber sizes typically showed Pearson correlations to age of r [almost equal to] - 0. 50, with no pattern of association by premolar type, sex, or trend over time useful in age estimation. Eleven raters with experience in skeletal analysis ranging from student to professional showed the qualitative method to be independently repeatable using only a written rubric and graphic examples. Raters' scores had Spearman correlations to age of 0. 70 [lesser than] rs [lesser than] 0. 85, and a mean error of 0. 91 years (SD 13. 7 years), in a sample of 20 subjects selected for approximately equal distribution by age and sex. Oral radiography is noninvasive, commonly available to archaeologists and routine in forensic identifications. This qualitative method is applicable in adults through age 90, and may be incorporated into existing protocols to advance assessment of population distribution and individual age...|$|R
