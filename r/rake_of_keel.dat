5000|$|The slope <b>of</b> the <b>rake</b> is {{measured}} by the number of horizontal units it takes for one vertical unit measured {{in the direction of the}} slope, or by the equivalent percentage.

2500|$|The {{most common}} type <b>of</b> <b>keel</b> is the [...] "flat plate keel", and this is fitted in the {{majority}} of ocean-going ships and other vessels. A form <b>of</b> <b>keel</b> found on smaller vessels is the [...] "bar keel", which may be fitted in trawlers, tugs, and smaller ferries. Where grounding is possible, this type <b>of</b> <b>keel</b> is suitable with its massive scantlings, but there is always a problem of the increased draft with no additional cargo capacity. If a double bottom is fitted, the keel is almost inevitably of the flat plate type, bar keels often being associated with open floors, where the plate keel may also be fitted.|$|R

40|$|Height {{and shape}} <b>of</b> <b>keel</b> differ in {{domestic}} and wild turkeys. Wild birds typically have {{a dip in}} the keel and no drastic slope change after the dip. The distance from the lip on the upper edge of the sternum to the tip of the cranial end <b>of</b> the <b>keel</b> is obviously greater in wild than domestic birds. Note that not only the distance between the arrows differs in the figure above, but also the curvature of the slope. Breadth <b>of</b> the <b>keel</b> is greater on domestic birds, but the height <b>of</b> the <b>keel</b> is greater on wild toms. The dorsal lateral process is larger on wild birds. Tip <b>of</b> <b>keel</b> is not calcified on store-bought birds. Note the lip on the top edge of the sternum in domestic birds. Again, the width <b>of</b> the <b>keel</b> is much greater on domestic turkeys. In cludes illustrations of wild toms vs. domestic toms and wild hens vs. domestic hens (bones) ...|$|R
