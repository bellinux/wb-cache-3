5|$|After {{winning the}} league {{championship}} in 1899, Villa's record-breaking average crowd of 21,000 allowed {{the club to}} invest in a two-stage ground improvement programme. The first stage extended the terrace covering on the Trinity Road side at the cost of £887; the second cost £1,300 and involved re-laying all terracing around the track to remedy a design flaw that caused poor sightlines {{for the majority of the}} crowd. In 1911, Villa bought the freehold of the ground for £8,250, the office buildings in the old aquarium and car park area for £1,500 and the carriage drive and bowling green for £2,000. This was the first stage in plans drawn up by Villa director Frederick <b>Rinder</b> that saw the capacity of Villa Park increased to 104,000. In June 1914, another phase of enhancements began at Villa Park to compete with improvements at other grounds around the country, including Everton's Goodison Park, where a new two-tiered stand had just been completed. The first stage of improvements saw the cycling track removed, new banking at the Holte Hotel End (Holte End), and a re-profiling of all the terracing to bring it closer to the newly squared-off pitch. <b>Rinder</b> turned to the renowned architect Archibald Leitch to design a new Villa Park. Their joint plans included large banked end stands at the Holte and Witton ends and the incorporation of the original Victorian Lower Grounds buildings, including the aquarium and the newly acquired bowling greens. The outbreak of the First World War severely hampered design and construction efforts.|$|E

40|$|A compact Raman LIDAR {{system for}} remote sensing of sea and {{drifting}} ice was {{developed at the}} Wave Research Center at the Prokhorov General Physics Institute of the RAS. The developed system {{is based on a}} diode pumped solid state YVO 4 :Nd laser combined with compact spectrograph equipped with gated detector. The system exhibits high sensitivity and can be used for mapping or depth profiling of different parameters within many oceanographic problems. Light weight (~ 20 kg) and low power consumption (300 W) make possible to install the device on any vehicle including unmanned aircraft or submarine system. The Raman LIDAR presented was used for Svalbard fjords study and analysis of different influence of the open sea and glaciers on the water properties. Temperature, phytoplankton, and dissolved organic matter distributions in the seawater were studied in the Ice Fjord, Van Mijen Fjord and <b>Rinders</b> Fjord. Drifting ice and seawater in the <b>Rinders</b> Fjord were characterized by the Raman spectroscopy and fluorescence. It was found that the Paula Glacier strongly influences the water temperature and chlorophyll distributions in the Van Mijen Fjord and <b>Rinders</b> Fjord. Possible applications of compact LIDAR systems for express monitoring of seawater in the places with high concentration of floating ice or near cold streams in the Arctic Ocean are discussedComment: 28 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

500|$|... "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" [...] {{continues}} to be used today by journalists in the media, as a reference for historical information on the Church of Scientology. In April 2007, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper interviewed former Office of Special Affairs director Mike <b>Rinder,</b> in a live piece on Anderson Cooper 360° titled [...] "Inside Scientology". The CNN story was prompted by the May 2007 airing of a BBC Panorama investigative program, [...] "Scientology and Me". In the interview, Anderson Cooper quoted directly from [...] "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" [...] article, when asking <b>Rinder</b> {{about the history of}} Operation Snow White, and if those tactics were currently used by the Church. <b>Rinder</b> answered by stating that the individuals involved with Operation Snow White were no longer involved in Church of Scientology activities, and that the incident was [...] "ancient history". Cooper then again referenced the Time magazine article noting that Behar asserted that he was illegally investigated by Scientology contacts during research for his article. Cooper questioned <b>Rinder</b> on the dismissed lawsuit against Time Warner, and <b>Rinder</b> acknowledged that all of the Church of Scientology's appeals against Time Warner were eventually rejected.|$|E
500|$|In February 2000, Church of Scientology {{spokesman}} Mike <b>Rinder</b> told Tribune Media Services {{that any}} spinoff deals based on Hubbard's novel would benefit Author Services Inc.; another Church spokesman, Aron Mason, stated, [...] "The church has no financial interest in Battlefield Earth. Author Services {{is not part}} of the Church of Scientology. They are a literary agency without any connection to the church." ...|$|E
500|$|Rothstein {{states that}} space opera is a [...] "part {{of the total}} fabric of Scientological {{thinking}} and narrative, but not of prime importance." [...] He argues that these teachings are a [...] "second order belief", in that they exist to support the group's core teachings about thetans. Mike <b>Rinder,</b> a former spokesman of the Church of Scientology, stated that extraterrestrial auditing is merely [...] "a small percent" [...] of their canon.|$|E
500|$|From 2006, {{according}} to <b>Rinder,</b> executives undergoing [...] "group confessions" [...] {{were made to}} stand in big trash cans {{in the middle of}} the floor with signs around their necks on which various derogatory statements were written. <b>Rinder</b> described how it became [...] "relatively routine" [...] for people to be [...] "slapped, punched, kicked, pushed, shoved, thrown up against the wall" [...] in order to make them confess. He told the Tampa Bay Times that he and other people were made to continuously crawl around a conference room table with their trouser legs rolled up, getting kicked from behind if they stopped, which resulted in them suffering severely contused and abraded knees after days of such treatment. There was an escalation in the level of confessions demanded, such that they became [...] "more and more dramatic and over the top in order to be acceptable." [...] He described how one executive was made to sit under an air vent with the cooling system turned up high, while cold water was poured over his head. After an hour or so, he was [...] "shaking so uncontrollably and his lips were so completely blue that he was incapable of talking". (The executive in question denied to the Tampa Bay Times that this incident had ever happened).|$|E
500|$|<b>Rinder</b> {{told the}} Tampa Bay Times that interrogations [...] "would {{be carried out}} by whoever {{happened}} to be there– 20 people, 30 people, 50 people, all standing up and screaming at you, and ultimately it sort of devolved into physical violence, torture, to extricate these 'confessions' out of people." [...] According to <b>Rinder,</b> the confessions were sometimes dictated by Miscavige, but more usually the inmates of the Hole would force each other to confess: [...] "The 50 people there are all screaming at me, telling me I've got to confess– I've done that, why don't I just admit it? I stole money, I had affairs– people would just literally dream up bullshit and start screaming it out, and then the mob goes crazy: 'Oh yeah, it must have been that!'" [...] Tom De Vocht, who was also in the Hole, recalled that [...] "everybody in that damned room— people are wild and out of control, I punched somebody. Everybody was punched. And screaming and yelling. It just got like, 'What {{the hell is going on}} here?'" [...] De Vocht rationalized his own involvement on the grounds of self-defense: [...] "If I don't attack I'm going to be attacked. It's a survival instinct in a weird situation that no one should be in." ...|$|E
500|$|Villa Park {{remained}} {{in much the}} same state for another 30 years, with no major developments until the late 1950s. During the 1930s the earth and timber terraces with wooden crash barriers were completely replaced by concrete terracing and metal barriers, a process first begun by <b>Rinder.</b> In 1936 he was voted back onto the board at the age of 78 after the club were relegated to the Second Division. Nearly 25 years after he had created his 1914 masterplan, <b>Rinder</b> resurrected it and looked to carry out the third phase of his developments. He died in December 1938 (Leitch had died in April), leaving his construction business to his son, Archibald Junior. The complete redevelopment and extension of the Holte End began in early 1939, supervised by Archibald Junior. When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, all construction across the country stopped. Unusually, given the austerity measures in place at the time, Villa acquired a special permit to continue construction of the Holte End; Simon Inglis notes [...] "How they achieved this is not recorded." [...] Work on the ground was completed by April 1940, and the stand was immediately mothballed as Villa Park switched to its wartime role. The Trinity Road Stand became an air-raid shelter and ammunition store while the home dressing room became the temporary home of a rifle company from the 9th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment. German bombs caused £20,000 worth of damage to the Witton Lane Stand, which was remedied by 1954.|$|E
500|$|Executives who {{eventually}} {{escaped from the}} Hole have said that its occupants were forced to practice group confessions {{in which they would}} confess supposed transgressions against Miscavige, bad thoughts that they had had about Scientology and disclose their sexual fantasies. Debbie Cook, who spent seven weeks in the Hole in 2007, said that [...] "most of the time the activities [...] were either you confessing your own sins or bad things that you'd done, or getting other people to confess theirs." [...] Mike <b>Rinder</b> commented on the bizarre personal dynamics of the Hole: [...] "These were your friends, people you had traveled with. But then, you get in the Hole? You can't trust anybody." ...|$|E
500|$|Through the Scientology {{practice}} of [...] "disconnection", Christman's {{husband and the}} majority of her acquaintances and friends who were Scientologists {{at the time of her}} exit from the group were excommunicated from her and cut off contact. Christman recounted how after leaving the organization, the Church of Scientology attempted to damage her reputation through a policy referred to as [...] "dead agenting". According to Christman, the Scientology organization publicized inaccurate information about her online, tried to get her removed from her position of employment, and opened a lawsuit related to her protesting against the group on church property. Then Scientology-spokesperson, Mike <b>Rinder,</b> called her a [...] "wacko" [...] and rejected her assertions as [...] "absolute bullshit".|$|E
500|$|It did {{not take}} long for Villa to lift their first League Championship trophy, and this was {{achieved}} in 1893–94. Villa were soon attracting large crowds; the club could regularly expect 25,000 people to attend home games. This was {{at a time when}} the FA Cup Final would attract only about 20,000. With poor spectator facilities and an uneven pitch, the Wellington Road ground was increasingly unsuitable, and in 1897 Villa's financial secretary Frederick <b>Rinder</b> negotiated the purchase of their current home ground, the Aston Lower Grounds. In the 1899-1900 season [...] became the top goalscorer in world football scoring 27 goals in just 33 league games and a total 30 goals in 39 league and cup games. The name of Villa Park was not used until about 1900. It came about through fan usage and no official declaration was made that listed the name as Villa Park. The ground was not purchased outright until 1911.|$|E
500|$|The Church of Scientology sued Reader's Digest in Switzerland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany for {{publishing}} a condensed {{version of the}} Time story. The only court to provide a temporary injunction was in Lausanne, Switzerland. In France, Italy, and the Netherlands, the courts either dismissed the Church of Scientology's motions, or set injunction hearings far beyond the date of actual publication. The company defied the injunction and mailed copies of the article, [...] "Scientology: A Dangerous Cult Goes Mainstream", to their [...] Worldwide editor-in-chief of Reader's Digest, Kenneth Tomlinson, told The New York Times that [...] "a publisher cannot accept a court prohibiting distribution of a serious journalistic piece.... The court order violates {{freedom of speech and}} freedom of the press". The Church of Scientology subsequently filed a criminal complaint against the Digest in Lausanne, and Mike <b>Rinder</b> stated it was in blatant violation of the law. By defying the Swiss court ban, the Reader's Digest risked a fine of about $3,400, as well as a potential three months' jail time for the Swiss Digest editor-in-chief. A hearing on the injunction was set for November 11, 1991, and the injunction was later lifted by the Swiss court.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of inflation, 1919 quotes for the {{implementation}} of the pre-war construction plans came to £66,000, compared to the 1914 quote of £27,000. By March 1922 this price had reduced to £41,775, and the directors pushed ahead with the plans for the new Trinity Road Stand. Construction began in April 1922 with the stand partially opened in August. Construction continued throughout the 1922–1923 season, with the stand officially opened on 26 January 1924 by the then Duke of York, later King George VI. He commented to <b>Rinder</b> that he had [...] "no idea that a ground so finely equipped in every way—and devoted to football—existed." [...] On completion the Trinity Road Stand was considered one of the grandest in Britain, complete with stained glass windows, Italian mosaics, Dutch gables in the style of Aston Hall and a sweeping staircase. Several commentators including Simon Inglis consider it to be Leitch's masterpiece; a Sunday Times reporter described it in 1960 as the [...] "St Pancras of football." [...] The final cost of the stand and associated 1922–1924 ground developments was calculated at £89,000, a sum that enraged the club's directors who ordered an investigation into cost and in 1925 forced Rinder's resignation.|$|E
500|$|The {{full title}} of the article is [...] "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power: Ruined lives. Lost fortunes. Federal crimes. Scientology poses as a {{religion}} but is really a ruthless global scam — and aiming for the mainstream". The article reported on {{the founding of the}} Church of Scientology by L. Ron Hubbard and controversies involving the Church and its affiliated business operations, as well as the suicide of a Scientologist. The article related the May 11, 1990, suicide of Dr. Edward Lottick's son Noah Antrim Lottick. Lottick was a Russian studies student who had taken a series of Scientology courses; he died after jumping from a hotel tenth floor window. The Church of Scientology and Lottick's family have differing positions on the effect Scientology coursework had on him. While none of the parties assigned blame, they expressed misgivings about his death. Initially, his father had thought that Scientology was similar to Dale Carnegie's self-improvement techniques; however, after his ordeal, the elder Lottick came to believe that the organization is a [...] "school for psychopaths". Mike <b>Rinder,</b> the head of the Church of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs and a Church spokesman, stated [...] "I think Ed Lottick should look in the mirror... I think Ed Lottick made his son's life intolerable".|$|E
500|$|According to Gibney, {{the church}} mounted an [...] "organized" [...] and [...] "brutal" [...] {{response}} to the appearance of its former members in the film: [...] "Some of them have had physical threats, people threatening to take their homes away, private investigators following them. That's the part that's really heartbreaking." [...] In March 2015, a New York private investigator named Eric Saldarriaga pleaded guilty to the federal charge of conspiracy to commit computer hacking after he illegally gained access to at least 60 email accounts on behalf of undisclosed clients, {{one of the main}} ones reportedly being [...] "someone who has done investigations on behalf of the Church of Scientology". Among those targeted were Mike <b>Rinder</b> and the journalist Tony Ortega, both interviewees in the film. The names of Saldarriaga's clients were not revealed and prosecutors declined to pursue action against anyone else, citing a lack of evidence. A few weeks after the film's TV première, Paul Haggis reported that a suspected Scientology spy posing as a reporter for Time had attempted to interview him in a possible attempt to obtain material to use against him; the Church denied the claim. Tony Ortega and another interviewee in the film, former Scientologist Marc Headley, reported that investigators from the church had surveilled them at Salt Lake City airport {{as they made their way}} to the Sundance Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|The {{pressure}} evidently worked, as <b>Rinder</b> {{wrote an}} [...] "Apology and Announcement" [...] on June 4, 2005 {{in which he}} told Miscavige, [...] "I recognise very clearly how Treasonous I have been towards you and Scientology." [...] He subsequently commented that such written confessions [...] "read like North Korean POW writeups," [...] alluding to the way that Korean War POWs detained in North Korea were forced to go through brainwashing to renounce their [...] "reactionary imperialist" [...] mindset. He explained to the Tampa Bay Times why people did not simply {{walk out of the}} Hole: [...] "If you leave you are going to lose contact with your family and any friends who are Scientologists. You have it pounded into you the whole time that the only reason someone leaves a group like that is because they are bad, that you have done something that force you to have to leave." [...] He noted people had invested a great deal of themselves in Scientology, that Sea Org members have [...] "made a commitment beyond even a single lifetime" [...] and that the prevailing attitude was that [...] "'I've lived through many lifetimes {{and there are lots of}} experiences that I've had that are far worse than this, so I can put up with this and I can stand it'." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 1770, a Doctor A. F. Shafonskiy, {{the chief}} {{physician}} at the Moscow General Hospital, identified {{a case of}} the bubonic plague and promptly reported it to German doctor A. <b>Rinder,</b> {{who was in charge of}} the public health of the city. [...] Unfortunately, <b>Rinder</b> did not trust the former’s judgment, and ignored the report. The next day, the Medical Council met and established the fact that the plague had entered the city, and informed the Senate in St. Petersburg. The response of the national government was to send military guards to the hospital in order to quarantine the cases. However, Shafonskiy and <b>Rinder</b> continued to stand on opposing sides, until <b>Rinder</b> denied Shafonskiy’s claim in January 1771. Shafonskiy submitted a report in February, arguing his case, but the officials chose to believe the German doctor instead. In March, there were definitive signs of the disease, and so Moscow’s government began implementing the established procedures, including setting up field hospitals. In June 1771, <b>Rinder</b> died after contracting the disease from a patient, and by September, the city was in the worst shape yet: the plague had peaked. 20,401 people died in that month alone, and roughly three quarters of Moscow’s population fled the city. [...] Authorities tried to stop the spread of the disease, but the poor were terrified of the destruction of their contaminated homes, and so hid dead bodies. This was likely one of the reasons that, in the aftermath, Catherine ordered the removal of all cemeteries from city centers and out to the borders and suburbs.|$|E

The series included interviews with Mike <b>Rinder,</b> former official spokesperson for Scientology {{and director of the}} Church's Office of Special Affairs, and Mark Rathbun, the former Inspector General of the Religious Technology Center. <b>Rinder</b> has said that he was physically assaulted by Miscavige on about 50 occasions.

2500|$|In the 1930s, {{the family}} {{acquired}} {{and moved to}} Sissinghurst Castle, near Cranbrook, Kent. Sissinghurst had once been owned by Vita's ancestors, which gave it a dynastic attraction to her after her father had disinherit her from Knole and his title. There the couple created the famous gardens that are now run by the National Trust. One of Vita's male suitors was Henry Lascelles, who would later marry the Princess Royal and become the 6th Earl of Harewood. Vita Sackville-West also had a passionate affair between 1929 and 1931 with Hilda Matheson, head of the BBC Talks Department. She called Hilda by the pet name of [...] "Stoker" [...] during their liaison. In 1931, Sackville-West was in a ménage à trois with journalist Evelyn Irons, who had interviewed her after her novel The Edwardians was published and became a best-seller, and Irons's lover, Olive <b>Rinder.</b> Sackville-West's 1932 novel Family History {{is the first of}} her books to raise the subject of lesbianism, albeit in an oblique form where the 24-year old heroine Evelyn Jerrold has more than familial feelings of love for her teenage niece Ruth. Jerrold, ashamed of feelings for Ruth, tries to destroy them by marrying a man named Miles Vane-Merrick, who she accidentally destroys by demanding more and more from him as she cannot bring herself to admit to her love for Ruth or see that Vane-Merrick cannot be a substitute for Ruth. The characters of Viola and Leonard Anquetil in Family History who are socialists, pacifists and feminists are thinly veiled versions of Virginia and Leonard Woolf. In Orlando, Woolf allowed Sackville-West to finally [...] "own" [...] Knole, and in Family History, she returns the favor as the Anquetils have children who are intelligent and decent people whom any parent could be proud of. Woolf never had children and was afraid that she would have been a bad mother if she did, so Sackville-West, in having her fictional alter-ego be an excellent mother {{was meant to be a}} [...] "gift" [...] to Woolf. Though Sackville-West regarded Nicolson's involvement with Sir Oswald Mosley's New Party (soon to be renamed the British Union of Fascists) as [...] "unfortunate", an angry Woolf wrote her in August 1931: [...] "Potto [...] expiring. What about Harold and Mosley? But don't write if it hurts". In the 1930s, Woolf and Sackville-West clashed over the question of pacifism as Sackville-West supported rearmament while Woolf remained loyal to her pacifism, leading to an end of their relationship in 1935.|$|E
