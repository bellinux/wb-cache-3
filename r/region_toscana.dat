40|$|The {{geographical}} data, both raster (satellite images, aerial photographs, scanned maps, [...] .) and vector (DCW, IGN {{products like}} BDTopo and BDCarto, [...] .) {{are growing up}} exponentially in amount, complexity and variety. Need of geographical data are growing {{in the same way}} among governmental and local autorithies and commercial and industrial operators for various applications like urban planning, environment monitoring, civil engineering project impact studies and communication networks design. Therefore, potential users have a ever increasing need of services provided by responsive organisations (data distributors) using efficient tools for acquiring geographical data, i. e. identifying, locating, selecting, purchasing and retrieving it. The ESPRIT III project n? 8017 GEographical Object Oriented heterogeneous Data Information Server (GEO 2 DIS) was born out of this need for efficient tools for geographical data acquisition. It was entrusted to a Consortium whose partners are MATRA SYSTEMES & INFORMATION from France. DORNIER from Germany and INTECS from Italy, with associated partners : IGN, O 2 Technology, CNUCE-CNR, <b>Region</b> <b>Toscana</b> and the municipality of Pisa. Project goals were the definition of consolidated user requirements at the European level, the definition of a common architecture of the geographical data server and the validation of the concept and of the architecture through three applications. The project has designed, implemented and validated a system based on two types of stations the data distributor station and the data user station, connected through LAN or WAN. The data user station allows users to submit queries to the catalogue and to define and issue a request for data and to receive them using powerful MMI, where the footprint of the data are located on a Reference Background. This MMI is customisable to the user 2 ̆ 7 s needs. The data distributor station answers to the requests of the data user station and offers the services of managing the catalogue and the data. managing the For the description of the heterogeneous geographical data sets a common data model has been defined as an object class. For GDS (and GDS descriptions) request, the Geographical Object Query Language (GeOQL, extension of the OQL (Object Query Language), {{which is part of the}} standard ODMG 93. This architecture allows to build the system on various GIS or DBMS, according to the operational requirements of the data distributor. It was actually implemented on the GIS Arc-Info and the OODBMS O 2 which has been fitted with a spatial indexing module giving responses times divided by ten compared with previous tools. The system has been validated by three users using it for acquiring data for three very different applications : Assessment of the Visual Impact of a sport and leisure centre in Deulemont (France), monitoring of the land use, suitability analysis for an waste disposal site near Pisa. The innovation and benefits of the system are that, even now, no other tool than GEO 2 DIS offers all the features needed for acquiring geographical data : the capability to manage large amount of data of both vector (including 3 D objects) and raster types and the geographical continuity, use by potential non IT specialists users, efficient response time and acquisition methods. As the needs of the users and the state of the technology continuously progress, some improvements have to be planned for the system. The most important of them is the use of Web clients. Partners are marketing the system. Multilingual commercial leaflet and technical description have been produced. Presentation have been made to potential customers...|$|E

Incidence rates of the two methods (CR 194. 5; HDD 192. 0 x 100. 000) showed no statistical differences. However, matched cases by the two methods were only 5, 038. The sensitivity of the HDD algorithm was 82. 9 % and its predictive positive value (PPV) was 84. 0 %. False positive cases were 9. 9 %. On the other hand, 12. 3 % CR incident cases were not identified by the algorithm: these were mainly made up of older women, not eligible for surgical therapy. Their three-years survival was 62. 0 % vs 88. 8 % of the whole incidence group. Conclusion: HDD flow performance was similar to observations reported in the literature. The agreement between HDD and CR incidence rates is a result of a cross effect of both sensitivity and specificity limitations of the HDD algorithm. This can seriously impair the reliability of the latter method with regard to the evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in cohort studies (i. e. the most effective approach to health setting in oncolog...|$|R

However, data on the epidemiology of HZ and PHN in Italy are very limited. A population-based study was performed by seeking for cases of HZ and PHN, occurred in the period 2013 - 2015, in the clinical charts of 56 General Practitioners working in 4 Italian <b>Regions</b> (Liguria, Puglia, <b>Toscana</b> and Veneto). The main objective {{of the study was}} to estimate the incidence of HZ and the proportion of PHN (at 1 and 3  mo from the onset of HZ; PHN 1 and PHN 3) among people aged ≥ 50  y. Overall, 598 cases of HZ were identified over 93, 146 person-years of observation, thus corresponding to an overall incidence of 6. 42 (IC 95 %: 5. 93 – 6. 95) HZ cases per 1, 000 person-years.

40|$|In urban environments, {{high levels}} of pollutants, as {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and trace elements, coming mainly from anthropogenic sources as vehicular exhausts, industrial emissions and waste incineration, impose serious environmental and biological problems. These pollutants cause concern, especially for their potential toxicity and the adverse health effects. In this work {{the results of a}} passive biomonitoring study, concerning the accumulation of trace elements and PAHs in Quercus ilex leaves and in the epiphytic moss Leptodon smithii, are presented. Both biomonitors were sampled in two Italian <b>Regions</b> (Campania and <b>Toscana)</b> along a gradient of environmental disturbance in i) urban, ii) periurban and iii) extraurban areas. Fresh leaves and mosses were extracted by sonication in a mix of methane dichloride and acetone (1 : 1 =v:v) and analysed for 16 EPA PAHs by GC-MS. Oven-dried (75 °C) plant samples were mineralized with acids (HF:HNO 3 = 1 : 2 =v:v) and analysed for elements (Al, B, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, V and Zn) by AAS and ICP-OES. In both Regions, trace element and PAH concentrations were generally higher in leaves and mosses sampled in urban areas than in periurban and extraurban ones, confirming the suitability of the selected native species to monitor air pollutants in the Mediterranean areas. The high concentrations of some elements in leaves (Mn, Na and Zn) and in mosses (B, Ba, Cd, Mn, Ni and V) from the extraurban site of Toscana, likely due to the influence of marine aerosols and of an industrial settlement located about 40 Km from the sampled area, put in evidence the importance of selecting suitable “reference” sites in order to find out situations at risk and properly evaluate the degree of pollution in urban areas...|$|R

For this reason the survival, behaviour and habitat selection of 10 wild translocated and 20 released ring-necked pheasants (10 offspring of wild captured and 10 from the farmed strain, both farm-reared) was studied using radio-telemetry during March-August (fixes were grouped in 3 categorized periods: March 2 - April 18; April 19 - May 28; May 29 - August 16). All the captive reared pheasants were reared according to the new disciplinary rules set forth by the <b>Toscana</b> <b>region</b> for the production of pheasants destined to be released in the wild as part of a game repopulation program. The study was carried out in a hilly area of the Tuscany characterised by 18. 1 % woodland (core: 1654895 E, 4850468 N). Results showed that live weights were higher in the farm-reared pheasants (either directly captured or offspring of the captured, P< 0. 05). The tarsus length statistically differed between the farmed offspring of the captured pheasants and the farm strain (P< 0. 05). The survival rates and breeding success of the surviving subjects were very high and did not differ between groups (survival rates: 50. 0 %, 70. 0 % and 80. 0 %, and breeding success: 60. 0 %, 28. 6 % and 50. 0 %, for the captive-reared offspring of captured wild pheasants, the captive-reared farm pheasants and the captured wild pheasants, respectively). The dispersion increased with time in the wild translocated pheasants (576 m, 889 m and 1209 m) while the offspring of the captured wild pheasants and the farm strain remained {{in the vicinity of the}} releasing site. The wild pheasants showed an increasing distance from the country houses, contrary to the offspring of captured wild pheasants and the farm strain. Artificial feeding stations were better used by the farmreared pheasants, which remained in the vicinity of the artificial feeding points. The results of our study showed that pheasants, reared according to the disciplinary rules stated for the production of pheasants for wildlife reproduction programs, although more expensive, can guarantee the genetic identity with the resident populations and are able to provide good survival rates and breeding success of the released pheasants, of course when restocking is carried out in areas suitable for pheasant wildlife...|$|R
40|$|The future {{agreements}} on the LULUCF sector will probably implement {{the role of}} harvest wood products (HWP) for climate change mitigation. As highlighted by many Authors however, for Italy to quantify the amount of HWP will impose {{a number of issues}} mainly related to the inconsistency of the data provided by the National Institute for Statistic (ISTAT). New data collected by the National Forest and Carbon Inventory (INFC) will probably provide useful information. In the meantime, however, a comparison based on the forest area reported by INFC and data on HWP provided by ISTAT, both scaled at province level, could be proposed. The 2005 was assumed as reference year for both data sources. At this purpose, grouping the 103 Italian provinces in 9 groups mainly based on the 20 administrative regions, the Pearson coefficient of correlation was estimated, for each group, comparing the amount of harvest reported by ISTAT with (i) the forest area, (ii) the plantation area and (iii) the total forest area, including both plantations and forests. Possible outliers were identified estimating the harvest rates per hectare of forest and considering the interquantile range of these values. A linear model was finally applied between the total forest area and the total amount of harvest estimated at regional level. The results highlighted a strong correlation between the amount of harvest reported by ISTAT and the forest area reported by INFC for 13 out of 21 regions. For 5 regions, including Lombardia, Piemonte, Lazio, Umbria and Marche the amount of harvest was only correlated with the area of plantations. No correlation was detected for <b>Toscana</b> <b>region.</b> Based on the harvest rate per hectare, 5 provinces out of 103 were identified as outliers. The amount of harvest reported for 3 of these provinces (Cremona, Mantova and Pavia) was clearly referred to plantations. The analysis of the studentized residuals based on the application of the linear model, highlighted outliers values also for Piemonte region. As in the previous case, the amount of harvest reported for this region was probably partially referred to plantations. We could therefore speculate that for many regions data reported by national statistics as referred to the amount of harvest in forest, were statistically correlated with the forest area detected by INFC. However, for some important regions, such as Piemonte and Lombardia, they were clearly correlated with plantations...|$|R
