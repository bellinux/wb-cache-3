40|$|Abstract — A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} to actively identify the open-loop characteristics of a DC-DC converter while the unit operates. A digital controller is used to perform both the closed-loop control of the converter and to periodically identify the “plant ” using a pseudo-random digital signal. Experimental results are provided for a digitally controlled 90 W forward converter to demonstrate accurate and effective identification of the converter control-to-output dynamic response. Hardware requirements and potential fast algorithms are discussed for implementing the <b>real-time</b> <b>converter</b> regulation and identification operations. Nomenclature h(m) = converter impulse response samples (duty cycle control to output voltage) H(jw) = converter frequency response H = converter impulse response vector PRBS = pseudo random binary sequence Ruu = auto-correlation function of input u Ruy = cross-correlation function between u and y u(m) = samples of the PRBS input perturbations U = PRBS input matrix v(m) = system noise samples W = Hadamard matrix WHT = Walsh-Hadamard transform WHT 32 = 32 -point WHT processing engine y(m) = converter output voltage samples I...|$|E

40|$|The {{realization}} of a TV-interlaced (TVI) to HDTV-interlaced (HDI) <b>real-time</b> format <b>converter</b> for studio applications is described. The conversion is performed by motion-compensated 3 -D interpolation. The estimation of motion {{is based on}} hierarchical block matching. Reliability checking of motion vectors is applied to achieve high picture quality. Furthermore, various picture classification algorithms are utilized to improve the reliability of motion vectors. This format converter has been developed using specially designed VLSI chips, digital signal processors, and field-programmable gate arrays for the reduction of hardware. The special VLSI chips have been developed using semicustom and full-custom design techniques. Besides employment within the format converter they are suitable for various applications in video processing...|$|R

The converter utilizes the photoconductivity {{effect of the}} compound Bi(12) SiO(20) for spatial modulation of electrical polarization in the compound. An optically absorbed write-in image is stored as an image polarization pattern in the device. Readout is effectuated electrooptically by using phase retardation in a polarized coherent light beam during the passage through the crystal. The operating mode required for achieving continuous image conversion with a high-speed recyclability is discussed.

40|$|High-precision {{positioning}} {{often requires}} high speed and high resolution displacement measurements {{in order to}} compensate for the small vibrations of critical components. The displacement sensor must be precise and stable {{over a long period of}} time to avoid expensive recalibration. This requires tight mounting tolerances, which are especially difficult to meet in inaccessible environments. The proposed sensor system is based on a capacitive sensor and consists of three subsystems: 1) a mechanical ``zoom-in'' system that performs self-alignment of the capacitive sensor electrode in order to reduce the mounting tolerances of the sensor; 2) a <b>real-time</b> capacitance-to-digital <b>converter</b> that employs an internal reference and electrical zoom-in technique to effectively reduce the dynamic range of the measured capacitance, thus improving the power efficiency; and 3) a self-calibration circuit that periodically calibrates the internal references to eliminate their drift. In previous publications, the three subsystems have been introduced. This paper shows how the different subsystems can be integrated to achieve optimal performance and presents new repeatability and stability measurement results. The overall system demonstrates a displacement measurement resolution of 65 pm (in terms of capacitance 65 aF) for a measurement time of 20 μs. Furthermore, the thermal drift of the sensor is within 6 ppm/K, owing to the self-calibration circuit. In measurement mode, the system consumes less than 16 mW.

40|$|Timer is an {{equipment}} {{that allows us}} to provide time measure. There are in all-day use a plenty of timers, but their use is ussually limited for one purpose only. Because of this I decided to compile a timer which allows to apply it for an individual needs. This granted a wider spectre of use in real life. We used a microcontroller from Atmel, and also a DCF 77 signal (atomic time signal) receiver and decoder. Further, we required a <b>real-time</b> circuit, DC/DC <b>converter,</b> and a powerswitch from manufacturers STmicroelectronics, and Linear Technology,respectively. For the imaging unit we used a graphic LCD connected via an I 2 C bus, which is commercially available spare part for mobile phones. Following the design we compiled and revived a hardware part of the device. After a succesfull revive, we gradually compiled a program for microcontroller. The program defines a processes for run of the device. It was written in programming language C, with use of compiling enviroment avr studio...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{building}} simulation {{is increasingly}} necessary for accurately quantifying potential energy savings measures in retrofit projects, to compliant with new stricter directives from EU implanted into member states legislations and building codes. For good result the simulation model {{need to be}} accurately calibrated. This requires actual weather data, representative for the climate surrounding the given building, in order to calibrate against actual energy bills of {{the same period of}} time. The main objective of this degree project is to combine observed weather (temperature, humidity, wind etc.) data with modeled solar radiation data, utilizing the SMHI STRÅNG model system; and transform these data into AMY (Actual Meteorological Year) files to be used with building simulation software. This procedure gives actual weather datasets that will cover most of the urban and semi urban area in Northern Europe while still keeping the accuracy of observed weather data. A tool called <b>Real-Time</b> Weather <b>Converter</b> was developed to handle data retrieval & merging, filling of missing data points and to create the final AMY-file. Modeled solar radiation data from STRÅNG had only been validated against a Swedish solar radiation network; validation was now made by the author with wider geographic coverage. Validation results show that STRÅNG model system performs well for Sweden but less so outside of Sweden. There exist some areas outside of Sweden (mainly Central Europe) with reasonable good result for some periods but the result is not as consistent in the long run as for Sweden. The missing data fill scheme developed for the <b>Real-Time</b> Weather <b>Converter</b> does perform better than interpolation for data gaps (outdoor temperature) of about 9 to 48 hours. For gaps between 2 and 5 days the fill scheme will still give slightly better result than linear interpolation. Akima Spline interpolation performs better than linear interpolation for data gaps (outdoor temperature) in the interval 2 to about 8 hours. Temperature uncertainty was studied using data from the period 1981 - 2010 for selected sites. The result expressed as SD (Standard Deviation) for the uncertainty in yearly mean temperature is about 1 ˚C for the Nordic countries. On a monthly basis the variation in mean temperature is much stronger (for Nordic countries it ranges from 3. 5 to 4. 7 ˚C for winter months), while summer months have less variation (with SD in the range of 1. 3 to 1. 9 ˚C). The same pattern is visible in sites at more southern latitudes but with much lower variation, and still lower for sites near coast areas. E. g. the cost-near Camborne, UK, has a SD of 0. 7 to 1. 7 ˚C on monthly basis and yearly SD of 0. 5 ˚C. Mean direct irradiance SD for studied sites ranges from 5 to 19 W/m 2 on yearly basis, while on monthly basis the SD ranges from 40 to 60 W/m 2 for summer months. However, the sample base was small and of inconsistent time periods and the numbers can only be seen as indicative. The commonly used IWEC (International Weather for Energy Calculations) files direct radiation parameter was found to have a very strong negative bias of about 20 to 40 % for Northern Europe.   These files should be used with care, especially if solar radiation has a significant impact of on the building being modeled. Note that there exist also a newer set of files called IWEC 2 that can be purchased from ASHRAE, these files seems not to be systematically biased for North Europe but haven’t been studied in this paper. The STRÅNG model system does catch the trend, also outside of Sweden, and is thus a very useful source of solar radiation data for model calibration...|$|R
