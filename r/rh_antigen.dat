40|$|The {{clinically}} important Rh {{blood group}} system is complex, consisting of multiple distinct antigens. Despite clinical recognition for over 50 years, the <b>Rh</b> blood group <b>antigens</b> have remained poorly understood on {{a molecular level}} until the recent identification and characterization of the "Rh polypeptides," the core structural proteins of the <b>Rh</b> <b>antigens.</b> This group of erythrocyte membrane proteins of molecular weight 30, 000 - 35, 000 daltons was first recognized by employing Rh-specific antibodies to immunoprecipitate radiolabeled components of erythrocyte membranes. By using antibodies specific for the Rh D, c, and E antigens, a series of highly related non-identical proteins were immunoprecipitated, indicating that the <b>Rh</b> <b>antigens</b> are composed of multiple related proteins. The Rh polypeptides have been purified and characterized, and they {{were found to have}} several unusual biochemical characteristics. The Rh polypeptides penetrate the membrane bilayer; they are linked to the underlying membrane skeleton; they are covalently fatty acid acylated with palmitate. While the Rh antigenic reactivity is unique to human erythrocytes, the Rh polypeptides have been isolated from erythrocytes of diverse species and are thought to be fundamental components of all mammalian erythrocyte membranes. The functional role of the Rh polypeptides remains undefined, but a role in the organization of membrane phospholipid is suspected. ...|$|R

To search for possible fatty acid acylation of the Rh polypeptide, intact human erythrocytes were incubated with [3 H]palmitic acid prior to preparation of membranes and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Several membrane proteins were labeled, but none corresponded to the glycophorins or membrane proteins 1 - 8. An Mr = 32, 000 band was prominently labeled on Rh (D) -negative and -positive erythrocytes and could be precipitated from the latter with anti-D. No similar protein was labeled on membranes from Rhmod erythrocytes, a rare phenotype lacking <b>Rh</b> <b>antigens.</b> Labeling of the Rh polypeptide most likely represents palmitic acid acylation through thioester linkages. The 3 H label was not extracted with chloroform/methanol, but was quantitatively eluted with hydroxylamine and co-chromatographed with palmitohydroxamate and free palmitate by thin layer chromatography. The fatty acid acylations occurred independent of protein synthesis and were completely reversed by chase with unlabeled palmitate.
