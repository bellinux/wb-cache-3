5|$|Because of its stiffness, {{light weight}} and {{dimensional}} stability {{over a wide}} temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and aerospace industries in high-speed aircraft, guided missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Several liquid-fuel rockets have used <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzles</b> made of pure beryllium. Beryllium powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel, but this use has never materialized. A small number of extreme high-end bicycle frames have been built with beryllium. From 1998 to 2000, the McLaren Formula One team used Mercedes-Benz engines with beryllium-aluminium-alloy pistons. The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by Scuderia Ferrari.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{remained}} {{merely a}} chemical curiosity for decades {{before it was}} used in commercial applications. From 1948 to 1952, the Carborundum Company, Niagara Falls, New York, applied for several patents on the manufacture and application of silicon nitride. By 1958 Haynes (Union Carbide) silicon nitride was in commercial production for thermocouple tubes, <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzles,</b> and boats and crucibles for melting metals. British work on silicon nitride, started in 1953, was aimed at high-temperature parts of gas turbines and resulted {{in the development of}} reaction-bonded silicon nitride and hot-pressed silicon nitride. In 1971, the Advanced Research Project Agency of the US Department of Defense placed a US$17million contract with Ford and Westinghouse for two ceramic gas turbines.|$|E

40|$|Carbon/carbon {{composites}} {{have been}} typically {{used to protect}} a <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzle</b> from high temperature oxidizing gas. Based on the Fourier’s law of heat conduc-tion and the oxidizing ablation mechanism, the ablation model with non-linear thermal conductivity for a <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzle</b> is established in order to simulate the one-dimensional thermochemical ablation rate {{on the surface and}} the tempera-ture distributions by using a written computer code. As the presented results indi-cate, the thermochemical ablation rate of a solid <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzle</b> calculated by us-ing actual thermal conductivity, which is a function of temperature, is higher than that by a constant thermal conductivity, so the effect of thermal conductivity on the ablation rate of a solid <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzle</b> made of carbon/carbon composites cannot be neglected.

25|$|Kliper's {{design was}} {{another attempt to}} solve the {{geometric}} problems of spacecraft. Soyuz has an Orbital Module, a hollow sphere, {{to be used for}} eating and hygiene, and an airlock located above the Reentry module (the capsule), with the docking mechanism at the top. In the event of an emergency, it would be lifted away from the rocket along with the reentry module, and the fairing over the spacecraft was designed to successfully split apart either circumferentially just below the reentry module in such an emergency or longitudinally if the flight should be successful. Kliper was designed with the Orbital Module below its reentry module, and the docking mechanism below that. This was made possible by constructing a reentry module broader than the orbital module, so that a pair of <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzles</b> for orbital maneuvering could have been fitted alongside it, as the later Salyut space stations had.|$|E

2500|$|Tungsten's {{high density}} and {{strength}} {{is also a}} key property for its use in weapon projectiles, for example {{as an alternative to}} depleted Uranium for tank guns. [...] Its high melting point makes tungsten a good material for applications like <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzles,</b> for example in the UGM-27 Polaris. Some of the applications of tungsten are not related to its refractory properties but simply to its density. For example, it is used in balance weights for planes and helicopters or for heads of golf clubs. In this applications similar dense materials like the more expensive osmium can also be used.|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} a half-century, several types of altitude-compensating nozzles have been {{proposed}} and analyzed, but very few have been adequately tested in a relevant flight environment. One type of altitude-compensating nozzle is the dual-bell <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzle,</b> which was first introduced into literature in 1949. Although the dual-bell <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzle</b> has been thoroughly studied, this nozzle has still not been tested in a relevant flight environment. This poster presents the top-level rationale and preliminary plans for conducting flight research with the dual-bell <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzle,</b> while exhausting the plume into the freestream flow field at various altitudes. The primary objective is to gain {{a greater understanding of}} the nozzle plume sensitivity to freestream flight effects, which will also include detailed measurements of the plume mode transition within the nozzle. To accomplish this goal, the NASA F- 15 B is proposed as the testbed for advancing the technology readiness level of this greatly-needed capability. All proposed tests include the quantitative performance analysis of the dual-bell <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzle</b> as compared with the conventional-bell nozzle...|$|R
50|$|Expansion in the <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzle</b> then further multiplies the speed, {{typically}} between 1.5 and 2 times, {{giving a}} highly collimated hypersonic exhaust jet. The speed increase of a <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzle</b> is mostly determined by its area expansion ratio—the {{ratio of the}} area of the throat to the area at the exit, but detailed properties of the gas are also important. Larger ratio nozzles are more massive but are able to extract more heat from the combustion gases, increasing the exhaust velocity.|$|R

2500|$|Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD). This {{was a major}} {{development}} area at Fulmer. A wide range of metals and inorganic compounds were deposited. [...] Examples are: tungsten coating of graphite <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzles</b> for ablation resistance, boron nitride crucibles for melting gallium arsenide, alumina coatings on carbon fibres for reinforcement of aluminium, zinc sulphide infra-red radomes for heat-seeking missiles. Fulmer's profound understanding of subhalide disproportionation led its chemists to devise {{a process in which}} halide vapour, pulsed at low partial pressure could be used to put uniform oxidation resistant coatings of aluminium or chromium on gas turbine blades. This was especially difficult because the coated surface had to include the insides of the blades' long narrow cooling passages – [...] 2mm diameter and 180mm long for example. In 1975 Fulmer hosted the fifth International Conference on Chemical Vapor Deposition.|$|E

40|$|A {{real-time}} {{measurement method}} is presented for the 2 -DOF swing angles of <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{by the use}} of multivision and <b>rocket</b> <b>nozzle</b> rotation axes. This method takes offline processing to measure the position of two nozzle rotation axes in image coordinate system by means of multi-vision and identify the rotation transformation relation between image coordinate system and fixed-nozzle coordinate system. During real-time measurement, the nozzle 2 -DOF swing angles can be measured with transformation of marker coordinate from image coordinate system to fixed-nozzle coordinate system. This method can effectively resolve the problem of occlusion by markers in wide swing range of the nozzle. Experiments were conducted to validate its correctness and high measurement accuracy...|$|R
