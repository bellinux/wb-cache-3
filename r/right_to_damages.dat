[...] Blackstone clearly labelled these as [...] "Private Wrongs" [...] in his commentaries, emphasising that property rights were enforced inter partes, and that the State was not necessarily one of the involved parties. In fact, the criminal law only intervened {{in the case of}} arson, defining it as [...] "the malicious and wilful burning of the house or outhouses of another man". This protection extended to barns and even [...] "stacks of corn". Arson traditionally attracted the death penalty, and had done so in Roman law.|$|E

50|$|In {{commercial}} contracts generally, a warranty is a contractual term, {{breach of}} which gives <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>damages</b> alone; whereas a condition is a subjectivity of the contract, such {{that if the}} condition is not satisfied, the contract will not bind. By contrast, a warranty of a fact or state of affairs in an insurance contract, once breached, discharges the insurer from liability under the contract {{from the moment of}} breach; while breach of a mere condition gives rise to a claim in damages alone.|$|E
50|$|Abandonment {{occurs when}} the insured surrenders to the insurer all <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>damaged</b> or lost {{property}} and claims payment for a total loss.

Abandonment can also mean refusal to accept from a delivering carrier a shipment so damaged in transit as to be worthless.|$|R

50|$|Anticipatory Breach is an {{important}} aspect of the doctrine of repudiation. Anticipatory Breach occurs where one party repudiates their obligations under the contract prior to the time set to perform obligations. In response, an aggrieved party may, by accepting the repudiation, elect to terminate the contract and claim damages. However, in an instance where an aggrieved party chooses not to accept the repudiation occurring before the time set for performance, the contract will continue on food and the aggrieved party will have no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>damages</b> unless and until an actual breach occurs.|$|E

50|$|A {{great variety}} of {{statutes}} have been enacted in the various states relating to the labour contract. Among these are laws defining the labour contract, requiring notice of termination of contract, making it a misdemeanour to break a contract of service and thereby endanger human life or expose valuable property to serious injury, or {{to make a contract}} of service and accept transportation or pecuniary advancements with intent to defraud, prohibiting contracts of employment whereby employees waive the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>damages</b> in case of injury, &c. A Federal statute makes it a misdemeanour for any one to prepay the transportation or in any way assist or encourage the importation of aliens under contract to perform labour or service of any kind in the United States, exceptions being made in the case of skilled labour that cannot otherwise be obtained, domestic servants and persons belonging to any of the recognized professions.|$|E

Sweden's position on prostitution was reaffirmed: [...] "Those who defend prostitution argue that it is possible to differentiate between voluntary and non-voluntary prostitution, that adults should have the right to freely sell and freely purchase sex (...) However, based on a gender equality and human rights perspective, (...) the distinction between voluntary and nonvoluntary prostitution is not relevant."

50|$|A breach by anticipatory {{repudiation}} (or simply anticipatory breach) is an unequivocal {{indication that}} the party will not perform when performance is due, or {{a situation in which}} future non-performance is inevitable. An anticipatory breach gives the non-breaching party the option to treat such a breach as immediate, and, if repudiatory, to terminate the contract and sue for damages (without waiting for the breach to actually take place) For example, A contracts with B on January 1 to sell 500 quintals of wheat and to deliver it on May 1. Subsequently, on April 15 A writes to B and says that he will not deliver the wheat. B may immediately consider the breach to have occurred and file a suit for damages for the scheduled performance, even though A has until May 1 to perform. However, a unique feature of anticipatory breach is that if an aggrieved party chooses not to accept a repudiation occurring before the time set for performance, not only will the contract continue on foot, but also there will be no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>damages</b> unless and until an actual breach occurs.|$|E

40|$|While private {{actions for}} damages against price-cartels by direct and {{indirect}} customers receive much attention, it is largely unresolved to what extent other groups that are negatively affected may claim compensation. This paper focuses on {{probably the most important}} one: suppliers to a downstream sellers' cartel. The paper shows graphically and analytically that cartel suppliers are negatively affected by the conspiracy depending on three effects: a direct quantity, a price and a cost effect. The article then examines whether suppliers are entitled to claim ensuing losses as damages in the US and the EU, with exemplary looks at England and Germany, thereby delineating the boundaries of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>damages</b> in different legal systems. We find that, while the majority view in the US denies standing, the emerging position in the EU, considering also recent case law and the forthcoming Damages Directive, allows for approving cartel supplier damage claims. We argue that this can indeed be justified in view of the different institutional context and the goals assigned to the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>damages</b> in the EU. The Annex complements our result that supplier damage claims are practically viable by showing how supplier damages can be estimated econometrically with an adjusted residual demand model...|$|E
