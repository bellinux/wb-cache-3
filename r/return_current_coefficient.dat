These are mainly used for train detection, transmission of information, broken train detection and transmission of <b>return</b> <b>current.</b> Especially, the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> is related to signal system, power system and catenary line, and track circuit systems. It {{is one of the most}} important component shall be dealt for the safety of track side staff and for the protection of railway-related electrical system according to electrification. Therefore, an accurate analysis of the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> is needed to prevent the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> unbalance and the system induced disorder and failure due to an over current condition. Also, if the malfunction occurred by the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> harmonics, it can cause problems including train operation interruption. In this paper, we presented measurement and analysis method at <b>return</b> <b>current</b> and it's harmonics by train operation. By the test criteria, w...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} {{here that the}} {{generation}} of <b>return</b> <b>current</b> in large-scale astrophysical plasmas such as solar flares {{is quite different from}} the laboratory environment. Whereas in the laboratory the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> is established inductively and subsequently decays on a resistive timescale, the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> in a solar flare is established electrostatically and therefore does not decay. An explanation of the difference is given in terms of the characteristics of the laboratory circuit...|$|R

40|$|If the primary, precipitating {{electrons}} in a solar flare are unstable to beam plasma interactions, it is shown that strong Langmuir turbulence can seriously modify {{the way in}} which a <b>return</b> <b>current</b> is carried by the background plasma. In particular, the <b>return</b> (or reverse) <b>current</b> will not be carried by the bulk of the electrons, but by a small number of high velocity electrons. For beam/plasma densities greater than 0. 01, this can reduce the effects of collisions on the <b>return</b> <b>current.</b> For higher density beams where the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> could be unstable to current driven instabilities, the effects of strong turbulence anomalous resistivity is shown to prevent the appearance of such instabilities. Again in this regime, how the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> is carried is determined by the beam generated strong turbulence...|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that the common assumption made in solar flare beam transport theory that the beam-accompanied <b>return</b> <b>current</b> is purely electrostatically driven is incorrect, and that the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> is both electrostatically and inductively driven, in accordance with Lenz's law, with the inductive effects dominating for times greater than a few plasma periods. In addition, it is shown that a beam can only exist in a solar plasma for a finite time which is {{much smaller than the}} inductive <b>return</b> <b>current</b> dissipation time. The importance of accounting for the role of the acceleration mechanism in forming the beam is discussed. In addition, the role of <b>return</b> <b>current</b> driven anomalous resistivity and its subsequent anomalous Joule heating during the flare process is elucidated...|$|R
40|$|The electrodynamics of {{electron}} beam neutralisation in solar flares {{is discussed in}} order to resolve recent controversy over the origin and evolution of the <b>return</b> <b>current.</b> It is demonstrated that <b>return</b> <b>currents</b> are established electrostatically and that the large radii of flare beams imply a resistive time scale so long that inductive effects are negligible along the finite beam length, even for anomalous conductivities. Consequently the commonly used steady state electrostatic (Knight and Sturrock) treatment of <b>return</b> <b>current</b> dissipation in flares is amply justified...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of ground <b>return</b> <b>current</b> in fault occurrence {{plays a key}} role in the dimensioning of the earthing grid of substations and of cable sealing end compounds, in the computation of rise of earth potential at substation sites and in electromagnetic interference (EMI) on neighbouring parallel metallic conductors (pipes, handrails, etc.). Moreover, the ground <b>return</b> <b>current</b> evaluation is also important in steady-state regime since this stray current can be responsible for EMI and also for alternating current (AC) corrosion. In fault situations and under some assumptions, the ground <b>return</b> <b>current</b> value at a substation site can be computed by means of k-factors. The paper shows that these simplified and approximated approaches have a lot of limitations and only multiconductor analysis can show the ground <b>return</b> <b>current</b> behaviour along the cable (not only the two end values) both in steady-state regime and in short circuit occurrence (e. g., phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase-to-ground). Multiconductor cell analysis (MCA) considers the cable system in its real asymmetry without simplified and approximated hypotheses. The sensitivity of ground <b>return</b> <b>current</b> on circuit parameters (cross-bonding box resistances, substation earthing resistances, soil resistivity) is presented in the paper...|$|R

The <b>return</b> <b>current</b> distribution affects loop characteristic of interconnects. To extract exact RL value, all of return paths have to be considered. However it is impossible because there are huge number of P/G wires in LSIs. As more wires are considered, the extraction accuracy improves but the extraction cost increases undesirably. The proposed method focuses the energy dissipated at P/G wires and utilizes it for screening return paths.

40|$|In {{printed circuit}} boards, {{transmission}} of high-speed digital signals is achieved using single-ended or differential transmission lines, typically using a microstrip or stripline configuration. This requires continuous reference planes, which {{is difficult to}} maintain in multilayered IC packages or boards. As a result, the signal <b>return</b> <b>current</b> may need to flow between different reference planes due to a cut-out in the reference plane or a signal via transition. The uncontrolled path of the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> results in signal integrity and electromagnetic interference problems. We propose a new controlled-return-current transmission line design to reduce this problem. Our approach is based on guard traces to help control the <b>return</b> <b>currents...</b>|$|R

In this paper, several double sided test boards were developed to evaluate the impact of different <b>return</b> <b>current</b> paths on radiated emission conducted in a Gigahertz Transverse Electromagnetic (GTEM) cell.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of a strong magnetic field (such as the geomagnetic field) the plasma tends to flow along the magnetic field lines, therefore in most ionospheric flow calculations the use of the gyrotropic approximation is justified. In {{the first part of this}} paper it is shown that the gyrotropic twenty moment approximation is equivalent to the gyrotropic sixteen moment approximation. The second part of the paper is devoted to the study of <b>return</b> <b>current</b> generated polar wind transients. Ionospheric <b>return</b> <b>currents</b> generate significant downward heavy ion flows in the topside ionosphere with peak values well exceeding 108 cm- 2 s- 1. When the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> ceases the polar ionosphere rapidly returns to its previous equilibrium state.

We consider the monoenergetic approximation for the primary beam and runaway model of the neutralizing <b>return</b> <b>current.</b> Methods. Propagation of the 10 keV electron beam from a coronal reconnection site is considered for the semiempirical chromosphere model F 1. We estimate the local number density of <b>return</b> <b>current</b> using two approximations for beam energy fluxes between 4 × 10 ^ 11 and 1 × 10 ^ 12 erg cm^- 2 s^- 1. Inelastic collisions of beam and return-current electrons with hydrogen are included according to their energy distributions, and the hydrogen Balmer line intensities are computed using an NLTE radiative transfer approach. Results. In comparison to traditional NLTE models of solar flares that neglect the return-current effects, we found a significant increase emission in the Balmer line cores due to nonthermal excitation by <b>return</b> <b>current.</b> Contrary to the model without <b>return</b> <b>current,</b> the line shapes are sensitive to a beam flux. It is the result of variation in the return-current energy that is close to the hydrogen excitation thresholds and the density of return-current electrons.
