This was KR's 6th league cup.|$|E

50|$|The 1968 Baltimore Orioles {{season was}} {{a season in}} American baseball.

25|$|After {{an initial}} {{estimate}} of Albert Pujols out for 4-to-6 weeks projecting an August 1 return, a reevaluation follow-up from a CT scan on July 1 showed faster recovery than originally thought, raising {{the possibility of}} a return by July 15, <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> All-Star <b>break.</b> However, Pujols surprised everyone by recovering very rapidly, and he was activated on July 5, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> minimum 15-days on the DL. Lefty reliever Brian Tallet was placed on the DL to make room for Pujols.|$|R

Regardless, Atlantic quickly responded to the complaints by reissuing the song with the three lines edited out and the [...] "One of a kind love affair makes a lame man walk, makes a blind man talk about seeing again" [...] lyric was moved up to <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> instrumental <b>break.</b> To add to the confusion, there are some lyrics web sites that have the line as [...] "You just have to hurt her, yeah".

5000|$|In {{a letter}} {{recovered}} in 2015 titled [...] "A Scene at Rawhide Ranch", Twain {{tells the story}} of two Tuolumne County miners named John W. Gashwiler and Johnny Skae. In the story, the two men are lowered into a shaft they are investigating in a bucket tied to a rope, which is tied to an old horse named Cotton. The horse has a tendency to take breaks for [...] "profound meditation" [...] and unfortunately decides to take one <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> bucket <b>breaks</b> free of <b>the</b> rope, leaving the men dangling with their lives in jeopardy. [...] "The bucket broke loose and went thundering down to the bottom, apparently 70 or 80 feet, leaving the two adventurers clinging desperately to the rope and glaring in each other's faces," [...] Twain wrote. [...] "Just then, Cotton stopped to meditate." [...] After some time and much shouting by the men, Cotton decides it has nothing better to do and saves the men. The men then proceed to buy the mine, horse included.|$|R
50|$|On 26 August 2009 ACF Fiorentina {{signed the}} right-back from S.S. Lazio on a five-year deal, he was {{presented}} to the press in Florence on 27 August; on successve declarations, De Silvestri stated he had reluctantly decided to leave his favourite club due to his strained relationship with president Claudio Lotito. After an injury that prevented him from appearing in the early weeks of the season, De Silvestri became a regular under head coach Cesare Prandelli and completed the 2009-10 campaign with a total 27 appearances. Under new Fiorentina boss Siniša Mihajlović, De Silvestri was originally confirmed as a regular, but successively lost his place as a starter in favour of Gianluca Comotto <b>after</b> <b>the</b> poor performance the team. However, he re-took the starting position (<b>right</b> back) <b>after</b> <b>the</b> winter <b>break.</b> He also played the last matches before <b>the</b> winter <b>break</b> as starting left back to replace the unavailable Manuel Pasqual.|$|R
50|$|After 10 a.m. Bem began strong {{artillery}} {{fire on the}} main group of the Russian army and began to advance his left wing. During the fighting, a bullet mortally wounded Skariatin. Command passed to General Iwin. The fighting was fierce for about three hours. At about 2 p.m., Russian resistance on the right wing began to weaken. Iwin sent two companies of the first battalion to reinforce their position. The commander of V Corps ordered the reserve artillery and cavalry to attack the Hungarian right wing, {{on the other side}} of <b>the</b> field. Lüders, <b>after</b> getting information that Hungarian reinforcements from Marosvásárhely had not appeared, sent formations to secure that road. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the artillery battery and some cavalry units, General Iwin's cavalry begin to encircle <b>the</b> Hungarian <b>right</b> wing. <b>After</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> Hussars, the Russian cavalry moved around the rear of the Hungarians. The Hungarians begin to retreat to Fehéregyháza as their front collapsed, with the Russians in pursuit. Meanwhile, the column of Colonel Dobanay was defeated by General Clam-Gallas's troops.|$|R
5000|$|Still, {{the season}} ended {{on a high}} note for Savićević. His {{performance}} in the 1994 UEFA Champions League Final at Athens' Olympic Stadium on 18 May {{would turn out to}} be his greatest moment in football and arguably one of the finest individual displays seen in the competition. He already gave indications of improved form and confidence in the second part of the Champions League season, scoring twice during March <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> winter <b>break</b> in consecutive home-and-away matches versus Werder Bremen (though the goal at San Siro came as result of an atrocious mistake by Werder defender). Still, despite smoothly finishing on top of the group and easily winning the one-match semifinal, Milan was in bit of a disarray heading into the final as both central defenders Franco Baresi and Alessandro Costacurta, the core of Capello's tactical defensive setup, were suspended. Considering that the opponent was the high-flying Johan Cruijff's FC Barcelona [...] "dream team" [...] with Romário, Hristo Stoichkov, Ronald Koeman, José Mari Bakero, Pep Guardiola, etc., Capello made a decision to fight fire with fire by sending out a lot more offense-minded formation. The changed approach suited Savićević just fine: he created the opening goal for Daniele Massaro and then scored a spectacular 35-yard half volley for 3-0 to put the game beyond Barcelona's reach. The sheer audacity and technical brilliance of the goal - decision to go for a well-placed lob from the right edge of the penalty area on Barca goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta who was slightly off his line in a situation when most would get closer and opt for a hard-driven shot as no defender was near - won Savićević much praise and accolades.|$|R
50|$|Over 6000 bands sent in {{audition}} tapes. 60 bands {{from around}} the country were chosen to participate in a judging session that took place at the Montelago Resort in Lake Las Vegas, Nevada on August 19-25, 2007. While most of these 60 bands were flown straight to Las Vegas as 'gimmick' acts, the ones being seriously considered for the show participated in a round of regional auditions and then auditions in Los Angeles before advancing to Las Vegas. Twelve of these forty acts were chosen by show producers and judges to become semifinalist acts to compete against each other in the main season of the show beginning October 19. Again, the show resembled Idol at this point, with telephone and text message votes deciding the winner. There was no results show <b>after</b> <b>the</b> live performance. In each episode, the results were shown in the green room. The two bands (one in later episodes) with the lowest votes were forced to perform in the green room via the internet. Unlike American Idol, however, the final episode was a winner-takes-all showdown between the top three bands, not two. The results were shown live in the grand finale and the host only presented the winner to <b>the</b> viewing audience <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> final commercial <b>break.</b>|$|R
