25|$|Construction {{commenced}} on March 8, 2005. Three major {{construction sites}} had been established, at Malmö C, Triangeln and Holma/Hyllie. By {{the end of}} 2006, another construction site had been opened in Lockarp, where connecting tracks to Ystad and Trelleborg were being built. The underground station at Malmö C was built in a 0.8km long open trench which was then covered. To minimize traffic disruption, the extensive and time-consuming work was done in stages. In order to build Triangeln station, two 25 m deep vertical shafts were dug at {{the northern and southern}} part of the site, and the station was then milled out of the rock by a <b>roadheader</b> — a machine equipped with a rotating cutter head on a telescopic arm. The rock was then lined with concrete elements to finish the structure. Hyllie Station was built in an approximately 7 m deep shaft; the vault that covers the station is a distinct landmark in the Hyllie development area. The tunnel was mostly bored by two tunnel boring machines (TBMs). Underground drilling commenced in November 2006 and February 2007, respectively. On 25 March 2008, one of the TBMs achieved breakthrough at Malmö C, followed by the second TBM on April 21. Work was completed in December 2010, six months ahead of schedule.|$|E

40|$|Geotechnical risks play an {{important}} role in the selection of tunneling method and machine types. In order to prevent some geological and geotechnical hazards during tunneling, selecting the most appropriate tunneling machine is very important. In this research study the main geotechnical hazards of tunneling by <b>roadheader</b> with their common mitigation measures are discussed. At present, three <b>roadheader</b> are excavating the three drifts of the Tabas coal mine in Iran. Hence, these drifts were used in this research study. The risk assessment matrix method in these tunnels showed that there is a lower risk of tunneling by <b>roadheader</b> than utilising the drilling and blasting method. The determined geotechnical risk assessment showed that the transverse cutter head was more suitable in comparison to a longitudinal cutter head for such tunnels. Then by using an instantaneous cutting rate model, the cutter head power of the <b>roadheader</b> was determined. According to the model, a lightweight <b>roadheader</b> with a cutter head power of about 80 - 110 KW and 40 t weight are suitable.

40|$|Abstract: Information {{concerning}} {{the size and}} shape of tunnel boring machine (TBM) debris is essential for designing efficient loading, hauling and dumping systems for TBM excavation. It is also very important in deciding how to recycle the TBM debris. However, only very limited information is available at present, and theoretical or calculation methods to estimate {{the size and shape}} are still open to discussion. In this paper, {{the size and shape of}} TBM debris are estimated by the well-known Nishimatsu's equation that is usually applied to <b>roadheaders</b> or shield-type machines with chisel bits. In this study, the equation was applied to the case of TBM excavation with disc cutters in which the shear failure or plane extends from a new groove to an adjacent pre-existing one. The estimated size and shape of TBM debris were found to be consistent with the measured results. Side forces applied to a disc cutter and the resultant stress on the cutter were consid-ered. The maximum debris size encountered in tunnel excavation was also discussed assuming that it followed the Gum-bel distribution. The results suggest that the proposed approach based on Nishimatsu's equation shows potential for future study...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Determining tunnel {{stability}} {{is a key}} issue during preliminary site investigation. In contrast, problems of excavatability have been largely ignored. While the choice of an economic tunnelling method is admittedly a clear priority in the planning stage, special investigations focussing on rock fragmentation (e. g. drilling or cutting performance, rock mass blastability or tool wear) are rarely carried out. This paper ex-plores possibilities to quantify key parameters for rock mass excavatability in drilling, blasting and cutting by TBMs and <b>roadheaders.</b> Although rock mechanical properties play a key role, geological parameters are rarely fully included in most projects. In some cases, the influence of geological features on rock fragmenta-tion can be more significant than varying rock properties. Geological difficulties can have a high impact on the economics of an underground construction project, especially when the chosen excavation system {{turns out to be}} unsuitable for the conditions encountered. Thus {{it can be argued that}} the geological and petrological characteristics of the rock mass should be evaluated with the same degree of effort as that for the geotechni-cal prognosis.

40|$|Longwall shearers usually {{suffer from}} {{excessive}} pick and pickholder consumptions and severe wear of the backplate of the clearance ring section of shearer drums. In practice, {{most of the}} drums were seen to be withdrawn from the face due to the abovementioned problems, while vane picks and their holders were intact due to the improper lacing design of the clearance ring picks. However, few underground investigations and their results {{on the effect of}} lacing arrangement of clearance picks on the service life of shearer drums have been published. Nevertheless, the pick consumption characteristics of shearer drums were not investigated in detail, since these are fewer pick consumptions with shearers when compared to <b>roadheaders.</b> This paper is concerned with the comprehensive in situ trials on the effect of lacing of clearance ring picks on the lifespan of shearer drums, and the pick consumption characteristics of longwall shearers at Cayirhan Coal Mine in Turkey. The lifespan of shearer drums employed with shearers in this mine increased 70 per cent, while the consumption rate of clearance ring picks decreased three fold through using an alternative lacing for clearance picks, indicating the significance of utilizing proper design techniques for clearance ring picks for the service life of shearer drums. Statistical analyses carried out, using the raw pick consumption data, implied that the clearance ring picks experienced much higher loads than vane picks, revealing that special attention must be paid to designing clearance ring picks. An average maximum consumption value of 41 was determined for clearance ring picks, with corner-cutting picks having the most replacements, while it was 35 for vane picks, on three-day based pick replacements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Underground {{excavations}} in rock {{are manufactured}} either by drilling and blasting or by mechanical methods using <b>roadheaders</b> or tunnel boring machines (TBMs). Both methods employ tools which {{interact with the}} rock and this interaction leads to the fragmentation of the rock {{as well as to}} the wear of the tools. Wear may be defined as the loss of tool material while interacting with the rock. Cerchar abrasiveness test is widely used to assess the abrasiveness of rock to predict of rock cutting tool wear because it provides good information on the abrasiveness with quick and easy testing procedure. Various parameters may affect Cerchar abrasiveness index (CAI), for example, surface condition of rock, mineral contents of rock, etc. In this paper, the relations between geological properties of rock and CAI were examined for several different sandstones. The derivation of some predictive models for the engineering geological properties of sedimentary rocks will be useful due to the fact that the preparation of specimens from the rocks in depth is usually difficult and expensive in preliminary design of underground projects. To develop some predictive models for the CAI from the indirect methods including the quartz content, the cement,grain content, EQC(Equivalent Quartz Content), Is 50 (The size-corrected Point Load Strength Index), Id 2 (Slake Durability Index) and W % (Moisture content),regression analysis were applied on the data pertaining to sandstone rocks from Iran. The grain content was included to the best regression model for the prediction of CAI. It was concluded that the quartz content, the cement content, grain content, EQC, Is 50, Id 2 and W % are the useful physical and mechanical properties for the prediction of CAI of sandstones...|$|R
40|$|Rock salt is {{globally}} predominantly mined by {{drilling and}} blasting. Despite the hazards {{associated with the}} handling of explosives and the complexity of a blasting operation, mechanical mining methods have not played {{a big role in}} winning operations. Mechanical mining methods have been used in rocksalt mines mainly for development or special tasks for many years, but it is improvements of machine weight and cutter motor performance made in the last years that have allowed for an economically feasible mining. Besides <b>roadheaders</b> and Marietta miners mainly used for drifting in rocksalt mines, continuous miners have been utilized in winning mainly in US potash mines. In comparison to the first mentioned machines continuous miners offer unique features making them especially suitable for the use in rocksalt mines. This thesis investigates the suitability of continuous miners for the production of rocksalt. The investigation includes specific boundary conditions as a basis for continuous miner operations as well as the layout of continuous miner systems with emphasis on the haulage chain. The economic and technical viability is demonstrated based on two mine layouts using continuous and batch haulage. The task is achieved by the use of a computer-based tool which has been developed for this investigation. It allows for evaluating a continuous miner operation based on changeable boundary conditions in an arbitrary rocksalt mine. The tool allows for appraising the stability of the selected panel layout, for checking the continuous miner power against minimum power required to cut the rock, for determining the production rates as well as the haulage system performance and for ascertaining the excavation time of a mine panel. Finally, the tool permits to calculate the cost per tonne of the continuous miner system...|$|R
