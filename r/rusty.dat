5|$|<b>Rusty,</b> a house cat, {{runs into}} a ThunderClan apprentice, Graypaw, {{in the forest}} in his backyard. <b>Rusty,</b> however, does not run away, but fights back. Bluestar and Lionheart, Graypaw's mentor, having watched the confrontation, invite <b>Rusty</b> to join ThunderClan. <b>Rusty</b> asks to think it over, and after talking it over with his best friend and {{neighbor}} Smudge, decides {{to go with the}} Clan cats. Lionheart and Whitestorm meet him the next day and lead him to the camp. Due to his house cat past, some members of the Clan are hostile towards <b>Rusty.</b> This hostility eventually leads <b>Rusty</b> to attack Longtail, losing his collar in the ensuing fight. Bluestar then ends the fight and announces that <b>Rusty</b> has earned his Clan name, Firepaw. He forms a strong bond with Graypaw, and with Ravenpaw, an apprentice to the ambitious warrior Tigerclaw.|$|E
5|$|Raymond grows {{furious with}} Rusty's {{handling}} of the case, but admits that he had also been romantically involved with Carolyn at one time. <b>Rusty</b> calls on Sandy Stern, a top defense attorney. At trial, it is revealed that the beer glass is missing, and Stern persuades Judge Larren Lyttle to keep this from the jury. Raymond testifies and perjures himself, claiming that <b>Rusty</b> insisted on handling the investigation, thus confirming the defense's claim of a frame-up. <b>Rusty</b> discovers that Carolyn had acquired a file for a bribery case involving a man named Leon Wells. Upon being confronted by <b>Rusty</b> and Lipranzer, Wells confesses that he paid Judge Lyttle $1,500 to have criminal charges against him dropped, with Carolyn acting as a facilitator.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone <b>Rusty</b> was a strong, slow-moving {{tropical}} cyclone that produced record duration gale-force winds in Port Hedland, Western Australia in late February2013. Originating {{as an area}} of low pressure on 22February well to the northwest of the Kimberley region of Western Australia, the precursor to <b>Rusty</b> steadily developed within a favourable environment. Gradually decreasing surface pressures in the region signaled intensification and the low was classified as Tropical Cyclone <b>Rusty</b> on 23February. Although a large, sprawling system, near-record high sea surface temperatures enabled <b>Rusty</b> to quickly deepen. Becoming essentially stationary on 25February, the system acquired hurricane-force winds as its core improved in structure. The cyclone achieved its peak intensity two days later with maximum ten-minute sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a barometric pressure of 944hPa (mbar; 27.88inHg). Thereafter, interaction with land caused its core to collapse before the system made landfall near Pardoo Station. <b>Rusty</b> weakened below cyclone strength on 28February. Its remnants persisted over Western Australia for several more days before being absorbed into an extra{{tropical cyclone}} on 5March.|$|E

5|$|Detective Harold Greer is {{initially}} {{in charge of}} the murder investigation, but <b>Rusty</b> has him replaced with his friend Detective Dan Lipranzer, whom he persuades to narrow the inquiry so that his relationship with Carolyn is left out. <b>Rusty</b> soon discovers that Molto is making his own inquiries. Aspects of the crime suggest that the killer knew police evidence-gathering procedures and covered up clues accordingly. Semen found in the victim's body contains only dead sperm. The killer's blood is type A, the same as Rusty's. When Della Guardia wins the election, he and Molto accuse <b>Rusty</b> of the murder and push to get evidence against him. Rusty's fingerprints are found on a beer glass from Carolyn's apartment, and fibers from his carpet at home match those found on her body. Lipranzer is removed from the case, and Greer's inquiries uncover the affair.|$|E

5|$|The {{thrust of}} Stern's defense is that Della Guardia and Molto have framed <b>Rusty</b> {{in order to}} cover up the bribery case. During the {{cross-examination}} of the coroner, it is revealed that Carolyn underwent a tubal ligation, thus having no reason to use the spermicidal contraceptive which was found on her. Stern asserts that the only explanation for this discrepancy is that the fluid sample was not actually taken from Carolyn's body. Based on the disappearance of the beer glass, the lack of motive {{and the fact that the}} fluid sample was rendered meaningless, Judge Lyttle dismisses the charges. <b>Rusty</b> confronts Stern for bringing up the bribery file in the case. Stern swears him to secrecy, revealing that Lyttle had a brief sexual encounter with Carolyn. Stern also confesses that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with <b>Rusty</b> and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned over to Della Guardia and Molto. <b>Rusty</b> throws it into a river.|$|E

5|$|Realizing he is {{powerless}} to defeat Julius, the Hero learns from Cibba about a powerful sword called Excalibur. Cibba helps him find the Excalibur {{only to find}} a <b>rusty</b> Sword instead. He explains that the <b>rusty</b> sword is the Excalibur and would reveal its true strength to whoever it finds worthy. The Hero then raises Dime Tower to reach the Mana Sanctuary and meets a robot known as Marcie. After reaching the top, the tower begins to collapse and Marcie sacrifices himself by throwing the Hero across. After obtaining and passing the sword's trials, the Hero confronts and defeats Julius {{at the cost of}} the Mana Tree's life. The Heroine's mother reveals she is the current Mana Tree and before dying, asks the Heroine to succeed her position.

5|$|Before the 2011 season Penske {{sold the}} owners' points of its No. 77 car to <b>Rusty</b> Wallace Racing, {{to be driven}} by owner <b>Rusty</b> Wallace's son (and team driver) Steve at the season-opening Daytona 500, for {{financial}} reasons. As a result, Penske moved Hornish to the Nationwide Series to drive the team's No. 12 Dodge Charger. He drove the 5-hour Energy 500 at Pocono Raceway in Front Row Motorsports' No.38 Ford Fusion, filling in for Travis Kvapil (who was driving in a Truck Series event at Texas). Hornish started in 26th place and finished 35th, 60 laps behind. He drove twelve races with the No. 12 team, moving to Penske's No. 22 for a 13th race at Iowa Speedway. At Iowa Hornish started in third place and led from laps 13 through 51, later dropping five laps behind to finish 24th. In the WYPALL* 200 Powered by Kimberly-Clark Professional at Phoenix International Raceway, he started in fifth place and led for the race's final 61 laps after passing Ricky Stenhouse Jr. (who led for a race-high 73 laps) for his first career victory in the series.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, {{there were}} {{proposals}} for completely buried flame fougasses {{to be used}} as oil mines but by then the emergency was over.

A few instances were missed, and their remains have been found. For example, the <b>rusty</b> remnants of a four-barrel battery, one of which still contained an oily residue, were discovered in 2010 in West Sussex.|$|E
