40|$|In the {{stabilization}} of soft subsoils before constructing structures on them, preloading {{techniques such as}} sand drains with surcharge load, are commonly used.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a set of}} results of plate load tests that imposed incremental cyclic loading to a sandy soil bed containing multiple layers of granulated rubber-soil mixture (RSM) at large model scale. Loading and unloading cycles were applied with amplitudes incrementally increasing from 140 to 700 kPa in five steps. A thickness of the RSM layer of approximately 0. 4 times the footing diameter was found to deliver the minimum total and <b>residual</b> <b>settlements,</b> irrespective {{of the level of}} applied cyclic load. Both the total and <b>residual</b> <b>settlements</b> decrease with {{increase in the number of}} RSM layers, regardless of the level of applied cyclic load, but the rate of reduction in both settlements reduces with increase in the number of RSM layers. When the thickness of the RSM layer is smaller, or larger, settlements increase and, at large thicknesses may even exceed those of untreated soil. Layers of the RSM reduced the vertical stress transferred through the foundation depth by distributing the load over a wider area. With the inclusion of RSM layers, the coefficient of elastic uniform compression decreases by a factor of around 3 - 4. A softer response was obtained when more RSM layers were included beneath the footing damping capacity improves appreciably when the sand bed incorporates RSM layers.

40|$|AbstractThe {{construction}} of a test embankment on ultra-soft ground containing an approximately 50 -m-deep soft peat layer with N-values of 0 to 1 {{did not result in}} catastrophic slip failure during construction but did cause substantial deformation of the adjacent ground. In addition, large-scale settlement in excess of 11 m occurred in the approximately 3 years following embankment construction. Based on field observations, it became evident that this large settlement was attributable to delayed compression of the deep peat layer, which was assumed at the design stage not to be subject to settlement. Based on laboratory tests and site investigations, it was deduced that due to depositions under continuous artesian conditions, this peat layer had an extremely low consolidation yield stress and was in a state such that even a slight increase in stress would result in large-scale compression. After confirming the ability of the analysis code based on soil–water coupled finite deformation theory, which included an elasto-plastic constitutive equation describing the behavior of the soil skeleton, to reproduce the observed ground behavior, the code was used to predict future settlement. These simulations were then used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} countermeasures aimed not only at improving stability during construction, but also at reducing <b>residual</b> <b>settlement.</b> The results of these analyses were applied in the planning of large-scale repair work performed on the test embankment. Also, when an embankment was subsequently constructed near the test embankment on similar ultra-soft ground, ground improvements were conducted prior to embankment construction as a countermeasure against <b>residual</b> <b>settlement.</b> In this paper, valuable field data related to these latter construction efforts is also presented...|$|E

This constitutive law is incorporated into a step-by-step numerical scheme where two kinds of elastic calculations are implemented: the first one concerns the determination of the so called reference stress cycles. while the second one is aimed at calculating the residual displacement and stress fields of the platform derived from the integration of the permanent non elastic deformations.

It is proven that the friction force that influences the foundation, the weighty nature of the bedding, and the visco-elastic properties of soils affect the amplitude and the frequency of vibrations. The authors present an approach to the calculation of vibrations of deep foundations resting on multilayer soils. The proposed approach takes account of the side surface friction of the foundation and the soil and elastic and viscous properties of soils. The soil is presented as a multilayer substance, and all of its layers are connected to one another by elastic-viscous elements. In this case, each layer of soil vibrates independently and provides multiple degrees of freedom to the system. A mathematical description of vibrations requires the identification of the coefficient of stiffness for each layer of soil, as well as the weight, the average per-layer stress and the angle of distributed static stress.

40|$|Rocking {{isolation}} of structures is evolving {{as an alternative}} design concept in earthquake engineering. The present paper investigates the seismic performance of an actual overpass bridge of the Attiki Odos motorway (Athens, Greece), employing two different concepts of rocking isolation: (a) rocking of the piers on the foundation (rocking piers); and (b) rocking of the pier and foundation assembly (rocking footings) on the soil. The examined bridge is an asymmetric 5 -span system having a continuous deck and founded on surface foundations on a deep clay layer. The seismic performance of the two rocking-isolated bridges is comparatively assessed to the existing bridge, which is conventionally designed according to current seismic design codes. To that end, 3 D numerical models of the bridge–foundation–abutment–soil system are developed, and both static pushover and non-linear dynamic time history analyses are performed. For the latter, an ensemble of 20 records (10 ground motions of 2 perpendicular components each) that exceed the design level are selected. The conventional system collapses in 5 / 10 of the (intentionally severe) examined seismic excitations. The rocking piers design alternative survives in 8 / 10 of the cases examined, with negligible residual deformations. The safety margins of the rocking footings design concept are even larger, as it survives in all cases examined. Both rocking isolation concepts are proven to offer increased levels of seismic resilience, reducing the probability of collapse {{and the degree of}} structural damage. Nevertheless, in the rocking piers design alternative high stress concentrations at the rotation pole (pier base) are developed, indicating the need for a special design of the pier ends. This is not the case for the rocking footings concept, which however is subject to increased <b>residual</b> <b>settlements</b> but no <b>residual</b> rotations...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of the new airport of Mexico City (NAICM) is challenging, as the subsoil at the site is very weak. The airport, which is under construction at the moment, is located on top of thick layers of Mexico Clay soils. These clayey layers consist of a mixture of both clay particles and pyroclastic volcanic materials. These unique soils are characterised by a high water content and compressibility. Upon loading, the soft soils will settle {{as a result of}} the consolidation process. This consolidation is defined as the dissipation of excess pore water as a result of an increase in stress. The rate of consolidation is governed by the hydraulic conductivity of the soil, which is in general very low in soft soils, and the drainage path. In order to speed up this time consuming process, vertical permeable elements can be installed in the soil. Upon installation of these elements, a reduction in drainage path is realised. This reduction in drainage path allows faster dissipation of excess pore water pressure, hence reducing the consolidation time. Due to the conditions at the site, the design of the runways is challenging. The differential- and <b>residual</b> <b>settlements</b> need to be within strict boundaries in order to keep the runways operational. Prior to the design of the runways, trial embankments have been constructed in order to measure the performance of different soil improvement techniques at this specific site. Based upon this field test results, prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) were selected as the most efficient soil improvement technique. Besides the PVD trial, the sandpile trial also showed promising results. The PVDs and sandpiles both decrease the drainage path length inside the soft soil layers. The main difference is the relative high stiffness of the sandpiles, the stiffness of the PVDs is negligible. By installing stiff elements in the soft soil, the loads applied on the top of the soils are transferred to deeper and stiffer soils. Hence, the total settlements of the top soft soil layers are reduced. The sandpiles could therefore be feasible alternative to PVDs, applied at locations in which the total settlement needs to be limited. The investigation into the behaviour of sandpiles in Mexico Clay soils is performed in multiple stages. First, analytical models are used for gaining knowledge about the expected sandpile behaviour. In the second stage the FEM software Plaxis 2 D is used for the numerical modelling of the sandpiles, using an axisymmetric model setup. The model is constructed in multiple steps, with increasing complexity. The first models simulate the material behaviour with the Mohr-Coulomb model, in the advanced models the Soft Soil Creep and Hardening Soil models are used. The final numerical model is verified by the measurement data obtained from the field trials. After fitting the numerical model to the field data, the verified model is used in the sandpile sensitivity analysis. In this analysis the sensitivity of the material properties and geometry of the sandpile on the performance are researched. The <b>residual</b> <b>settlements</b> or performance, which is defined as the difference in settlement after construction and over a period of 8 years, is affected by the length, radius and centre to centre (ctc) distance of the sandpile. Adjusting the pile stiffness has minimal effect on the performance of the sandpile. An optimum in performance is found by varying both the pile radius and ctc distance. A combination of a small pile diameter with a small ctc distance results in the best performance. When comparing the performance of both sandpile and PVD, the PVD is found to be more effective in terms of performance. The additional stiffness of the sandpile is not reducing the total settlements, on the contrary, the self-weight of the piles increases the total settlements by providing an additional load to the soft soil layers located underneath the pile tip. In conclusion the sandpiles have no additional benefit over the use of PVDs, therefore the application of sandpiles at the NAICM site is not a feasible alternative to the use of PVDs. NAIC...|$|R
40|$|Megalopolises in the Pearl River Delta, {{including}} Guangzhou and Hong Kong, {{have experienced}} various degree of ground subsidence. The causes {{can be divided}} into two categories: natural subsidence and the human-induced subsidence. Monitoring the ground subsidence can not only help people to find out the distributions in both spatial and temporal fields, but also guide people to minimize the hazard ahead. Thus, it is significant to monitor the ground subsidence accurately, timely and frequently. This dissertation research uses the Environmental Satellite Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ENVISAT ASAR) data received at the Chinese University of Hong Kong Satellite Remote Sensing Receiving Station and SAR Interferometry (InSAR) technology as a powerful tool for large-scale ground deformation monitoring in Guangzhou and Hong Kong areas. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) method is used to detect ground deformation in the urban area of Guangzhou city. A ground deformation rate map with scattered distribution of point targets shows the maximum subsidence (rise) rate as high as - 26 to - 20 mma- 1 (16 - 21 mma- 1), implying that the study area is an active zone for ground deformation. Based on the point target map, a contour ground deformation rate map is generated. All the six ground collapse accidents that occurred in 2007 - 2008 fall within the subsidence zones, qualitatively validating the IPTA results. Ground subsidence and geological conditions on Datansha Island are examined. The results indicate that the local geological conditions and underground engineering projects are responsible for ground subsidence and ground collapse accidents occurred there. To interpret the distribution of active ground subsidence zones, a local geological map is used as a reference for generating a series of thematic maps. The results show that geological faults, rock distribution, over-development, and underground engineering projects may be four factors leading to the distribution of the active ground subsidence zones. The Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) was built on a site of 12. 5 km 2, of which 75 % is reclaimed foundation. Thus, the stability of ground foundation of HKIA is of public concern. I use the PSI method and ENVISAT ASAR data to detect the <b>residual</b> <b>settlement</b> rate from 19 April 2006 to 9 January 2008. I use ground truth data to develop empirical correction models for correcting systematic biases in the ASAR PSI-detected settlement rate. The corrected data follow the Lorentz distribution well, implying that the <b>residual</b> <b>settlement</b> process is dominated by two modes or categories of settlement rates. I find unreasonable positive values of the ASAR PSI-detected annual ground settlement rate, which follow a normal distribution. I draw a scatter plot with ground deformation rate value and coherence value of each point targets. Point targets with lower coherence values and greater positive values are extracted and drawn on a geographical map. Most of these point targets are located at the airport Midfield, which is under construction. A ground settlement rate map of HKIA shows that an area of the Passenger Terminal Building, and an area of the Southern Runway are two relatively stable areas, and one major continuous settlement area covers the airport Midfield. General spatial distribution patterns of ASAR PSI-detected ground settlement rate agree well with model-predicted <b>residual</b> <b>settlement</b> rates. Zhao, Qing. Adviser: Lin Hui.

40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: The {{standard}} approach to seismic design of shallow foundations {{is equivalent to}} ensuring that the bearing strength factor of safety does not fall below a certain value. However, brief instances of bearing failure (yielding) during an earthquake {{may not necessarily be}} serious. A more important consideration will be the residual foundation displacements accumulated {{at the end of the}} earthquake. Macro-elements provide a simple way of capturing the essential features of soil-foundation interaction, including the residual foundation displacements, and are readily amenable to routine structural analysis. The shallow foundation macro-element examined in this study is based on existing macro-elements. It accounts for both the elastic (small displacement) and plastic (yielding) phases of dynamic behaviour. Modelling with the macro-element produces important insights into shallow foundation performance. Permanent vertical displacement (settlement) of the foundation is predicted to accumulate only if there are many instances during an earthquake when yielding beneath the foundation occurs, with the magnitude of <b>residual</b> <b>settlement</b> being dependent on the earthquake magnitude and duration, and the static vertical factor of safety against bearing failure. Residual rotation and translation of the foundation is inferred to be dependent on the characteristics of an individual earthquake. ...|$|E

40|$|Comprehensive {{results from}} cyclic plate loading at a {{diameter}} of 300 mm supported by layers of geocell are presented. The plate load tests were performed in a test pit measuring in plane and 700 mm in depth. To simulate half and full traffic loadings, fifteen loading and unloading cycles were applied to the loading plate with amplitudes of 400 and 800 kPa. The optimum embedded depth of the first layer of geocell beneath the loading plate and the optimum vertical spacing of geocell layers, based on plate settlement, are both approximately 0. 2 times loading plate diameter. The results show that installation of the geocell layers in the foundation bed, increase the resilient behavior in addition to reduction of accumulated plastic and total settlement of pavement system. Efficiency of geocell reinforcement was decreased by {{increasing the number of}} the geocell layers for all applied stress levels and number of cycles of applied loading. The results of the testing reveal the ability of the multiple layers of geocell reinforcement to 'shakedown' to a fully resilient behavior after a period of plastic settlement except when {{there is little or no}} reinforcement and the applied cyclic pressure are large. When shakedown response is observed, then both the accumulated plastic settlement prior to a steady-state response being obtained and the resilient settlements thereafter are reduced. The use of four layers of geocell respectively decreases the total and <b>residual</b> plastic <b>settlements</b> about 53 % and 63 % and increases the resilient settlement 145 % compared with the unreinforced case. The inclusion of the geocell layers also reduces the vertical stress transferred down through the pavement by distributing the load over a wider area.

Two types of small scale model tests and laboratory element tests, in which a single-point loading method and a moving-wheel loading method were adopted, were mainly performed with a base course material under air-dried condition and saturated condition. Based on the test results, the applicability of a multi-ring shear test, which is a torsional simple shear test, to an element test of granular base course materials subjected to moving wheel loads, {{and the influence of}} water content and moving-wheel loads on the deformation–strength characteristics of granular roadbed were examined. The results indicate that the multi-ring shear test has excellent applicability to the estimation of deformation behavior of granular base course materials subjected to repeated moving-wheel loads.

40|$|AbstractThe authors {{previously}} {{extended the}} macro-element method proposed by Sekiguchi to include water absorption and discharge functions and incorporated {{this into a}} soil–water coupled finite deformation analysis code capable of accounting for inertial forces. The primary objective {{of this study is}} to validate the ability of the proposed method to simulate actual ground behavior by comparing the simulation results with the actual measurements of the embankment loading of a soft peat ground improved with vertical drains and vacuum consolidation. It was found that the proposed method is capable of comprehensively and closely simulating not only the magnitude of settlement, but also various ground behaviors, including the deformation of the surrounding ground and pore water pressure distributions. Furthermore, additional simulations were performed to elucidate the effect of a continuous middle sand layer found to exist and to span the entire improved area at an actual embankment site. The next objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the impact of ground improvement, using vertical drains and vacuum consolidation with embankment loading on a soft ground, placing a particular focus on the effect of drain spacing. In this case, an ultra-soft ground with alternating peat and clay layers was modeled to represent a typical ground to which vacuum consolidation would be applied. Based on a series of simulations, it was found that, although the use of vacuum consolidation in combination with vertical drains is effective in cases where it is necessary to limit the deformation of the surrounding ground, the same reduction in <b>residual</b> <b>settlement</b> can be achieved using vertical drains alone, provided that the drains are deployed at a sufficient frequency...|$|E
40|$|A new seismic design {{philosophy}} is illuminated, {{taking advantage of}} soil ""failure"" to protect the superstructure. Instead of over-designing the foundation {{to ensure that the}} loading stemming from the structural inertia can be ""safely"" transmitted onto the soil (as with conventional capacity design), and then reinforce the superstructure to avoid collapse, why not do exactly the opposite by intentionally under-designing the foundation to act as a ""safety valve""? The need for this ""reversal"" stems from the uncertainty in predicting the actual earthquake motion, and the necessity of developing new more rational and economically efficient earthquake protection solutions. A simple but realistic bridge structure is used as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the new approach. Two alternatives are compared: one complying with conventional capacity design, with over-designed foundation so that plastic ""hinging"" develops in the superstructure; the other following the new design philosophy, with under-designed foundation, ""inviting"" the plastic ""hinge"" into the soil. Static ""pushover"" analyses reveal that the ductility capacity of the new design concept is an order of magnitude larger than of the conventional design: the advantage of ""utilising"" progressive soil failure. The seismic performance of the two alternatives is investigated through nonlinear dynamic time history analyses, using an ensemble of 29 real accelerograms. It is shown that the performance of both alternatives is totally acceptable for moderate intensity earthquakes, not exceeding the design limits. For large intensity earthquakes, exceeding the design limits, the performance of the new design scheme is proven advantageous, not only avoiding collapse but hardly suffering any inelastic structural deformation.

The plan set goals to reclaim 21 areas in the Jiangsu coastal zone with main objective to achieve an economical impulse for the Jiangsu province. The Tiaozini reclamation acted as a pilot project and was assigned a priority area due to its size and strategic position between Lianyungang and Shanghai. The proposed occupation guidelines for Tiaozini hardly met the objective of giving an economical impulse and revision of the area was required. The northern part of Tiaozini was still under construction and was further assessed in this study. The Dutch layer approach was explicitly used as an analyzing tool to make a top-down preliminary design for the Tiaozini port area using Dutch norms and standards. This tool allowed the study to be divided in three conditioning layers; occupation, network and base layer allowed for a multidisciplinary and iterative process. The most suitable occupation was determined using macroeconomic, industry-specific and port analysis. Due to the favorable investment climate ensuring future potential, lack of competitors and presence of partners, an efficiently organized public-private petrochemical port area was determined as preliminary occupation for the northern part of Tiaozini. The supporting transport network should take the following criteria into account: modal split, flexibility, sustainability and capacity. These criteria were determined by the characteristics of the petrochemical industry. The connection between the network and base layer was made by the use of the main enabling road connection. The embankment settlement for the required six-lane highway was calculated using D-Settlement numerical program in combination with NEN-Bjerrum calculation method and checked using analytical NEN-Koppejan method. A 4. 5 m high surcharge preload in combination with vertical drains was required for six months in order to fulfill the <b>residual</b> <b>settlement</b> requirements. PLAXIS was used to evaluate the stability of the newly designed dike with a design return period of 1. 000 years, allowing safety for the petrochemical port area. With a safety factor of 1. 8 leading to multiple simultaneous slip surfaces, the new dike design is capable of ensuring safety for the petrochemical port area. All results support the presumption the Tiazoni area is suitable for petrochemical industry. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|The ongoing global {{transformation}} of human habitats from rural villages to ever growing urban agglomerations induces unprecedented seismic risks in earthquake prone regions. To mitigate affiliated perils requires the seismic assessment of built environments. Numerous studies emphasize that remote sensing {{can play a}} valuable role in supporting the extraction of relevant features for preevent vulnerability analysis. However, the majority of approaches operate on building level. This induces the deployment of very high spatial resolution remote sensing data, which hampers, nowadays, utilization capabilities for larger areas due to data costs and processing requirements. In this paper, we alter the spatial scale of analysis and propose concepts and methods to estimate the seismic vulnerability level of homogeneous urban structures. A procedure is designed, which comprises four main steps dedicated to: 1) delineation of urban structures {{by means of a}} tailored unsupervised data segmentation procedure with scale optimization; 2) characterization of urban structures by a joint exploitation of multisensor data; 3) selection of most feasible features under consideration of in situ vulnerability information; and 4) estimation of seismic vulnerability levels of urban structures within a supervised learning framework. We render the prediction problem in three ways to address operational requirements that can evolve in real-life situations. 1) To discriminate two or more classes based on labeled samples of all classes present in the data under investigation, we use the framework of soft margin support vector machines (C-SVM). 2) To consider situations, where solely labeled samples are available for the class(es) of interest and not for all classes present in the data, we deploy ensembles of ν-one-class SVM (ν-OC-SVM). and 3) To fit data with a higher statistical level of measurement (interval or ratio scale), we utilize a support vector regression (SVR) approach to estimate a regression function from the training samples. Experimental results are obtained for the earthquake-prone mega city Istanbul, Turkey. We use multispectral data from the RapidEye constellation, elevation measurements from the TanDEM-X mission, and spatiotemporal analyses based on data from the Landsat archive to characterize the urban environment. In addition, different in situ data sets are incorporated for Istanbul’s district Zeytinburnu and the <b>residual</b> <b>settlement</b> area of Istanbul. When estimating damage grades for Zeytinburnu with SVR, best models are characterized by mean absolute percentage errors less than 11...|$|E
40|$|Repeated train loads produce {{settlements}} in railway tracks, particularly in ballasted trail tracks. When the settlement reaches the allowable limit, a maintenance method {{should be applied}} to bring the railway tracks into the original position. Settlements in railway tracks are hugely influenced by degree of ballast fouling (i. e., a ballast fouling index) in addition to train loads themselves (i. e., from large number of train passes). Sources of ballast fouling vary from ballast layer itself to underneath layers. Fouling materials coming from underneath layers {{is also an important}} source of ballast fouling in addition to particle crushing. Tamping method, stoneblowing and cleaning/replacement are the maintenance methods in practice currently. While replacement method is rarely applied due to huge costs and interruption to regular traffic, tamping method is applied throughout the world. However, tamping application induces particle crushing due to tamping tools in addition to loosening of top ballasts (i. e., thereby reducing original compaction level). Effect of tamping method on settlement characteristics haven’t been studied before. In this research, effects of tamping application on settlement characteristics of fouled ballast were studied conducting scaleddown model tests. Fouled ballast was simulated by gap-graded gradation curves with gravel (i. e., 1 / 5 size of actual ballast) and medium sand (D 50 = 1. 54 mm). In model tests, 100 loading cycles (no. of loading cycles were limited to 100 as this is a manual-controlled process) were applied to simulate cyclic behaviour with the designed vertical stress. After 100 loading cycles were applied, tamping method was simulated as in field conditions using a simple tool. After tamping application, again 100 loading cycles were applied with the same vertical stress. Continuous images were captured during each loading cycle to obtain strain distribution in ballast layer. The results revealed that settlement characteristics are influenced by degree of ballast fouling in addition to tamping application. As anticipated, the results suggested that settlement reduce after tamping application, mainly due to densification of specimen from previous 100 loading cycles. The results further revealed that the largest reduction in settlement occurs at 30 - 50 % of fouling index (FIP,m). Relationship of settlement ? no. of loading cycles was fitted as two processes; initial and <b>residual</b> <b>settlement</b> processes. The results suggested that initial settlement rate (?) becomes smaller after tamping application beyond 15 % of FIP,m. The results also suggested that <b>residual</b> <b>settlement</b> rate increases after taming application beyond 30 % of FIP,m. If results are interpreted in terms of practical application, {{it can be said that}} tamping application is effective only up to 30 % of FIP,m (which is equal to percentage of fouling materials for gadgraded sand-gravel specimens tested in this research). More detailed analysis on effects of tamping application on settlement characteristics were studied using strain distribution evaluated using the images captured during loading cycles in Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) software (i. e., Flow-PIV). The PIV results confirmed that tamping application loosens top ballasts, particularly, at the sides of sleeper, where tamping tools are inserted. In next step, void ratio characteristics of sand-gravel specimens (simulating fouled ballasts) were evaluated in YADE (a DEM approach). In YADE, a method was proposed to produce gap-graded gradation curves. Verification of YADE simulations were done by the results of laboratory density tests. The comparison of results showed differences in void ratios (i. e., maximum and minimum void ratios). As laboratory materials consist of irregular particles and DEM simulations were conducted with spheres, the difference in void ratios is assumed to be due to different shapes of particles. Therefore, in next analysis, a clump particle was introduced using the results of image analysis (i. e., in ImageJ) on shape characteristics of medium sand and gravel particles. Introduction of clump particles led to have similar results as those of laboratory void ratio characteristics. The results further revealed that variation of void ratios with FIP,m can be used to interpret settlement characteristics with some accuracy. In next analysis, strength and deformation characteristics of fouled ballast were studied from triaxial compression tests. Triaxial compression tests were conducted in two series; dense and loose specimens simulated by 80 and 50 % of relative density, Dr respectively. The results from laboratory tests suggested that strength properties, represented by peak deviator stress, qf, and failure friction angle, ??f, change with FIP,m with some similarities with variation of ??with FIP,m. In next part, triaxial compression tests were conducted in DEM simulations with spheres. However, as comparison of DEM results with those of laboratory tests is influenced by particle shape, in next analysis, a clump particle was introduced in DEM simulations. The results suggested that clump shape can simulate stressstrain behaviours same as laboratory triaxial compression tests. As different gradation curves can be simulated in YADE simulations, the method used can be extended to different type of fouled ballasts through different gradation curves. Also, it is also clear that variation of qf and ?f with FIP,m can be used to interpret settlement characteristics (particularly, variation of ??) of fouled ballasts with FIP,m with some accuracy. In a simultaneous work, an in-situ method was proposed to evaluate particle size distribution of fouled ballast using image analysis techniques. ImageJ software was used to conduct image analysis. Particles (i. e., both gravel and medium sand) were simulated by different shapes in ImageJ and found the best available shape as ellipse shape to simulate laboratory particles. Gradation curves were evaluated as area-, number of particle- and volume-based gradation curves. Area-based gradation curve was possible to produce the gradation curve evaluated by sieve analysis test with some image analysis techniques. However, number of particles-based gradation curve underestimates that of sieve analysis. However, given both area- and number of particle-based gradation curves are not based on volume of particles (which is the case with sieve analysis test), a method was proposed to evaluate thickness of particles using 2 D images (hence, evaluation of volume of particle is possible). It was also discussed how definition of grain size should be used in image analysis results to compare with those of sieve analysis test. Finally, a simple method was proposed to evaluate volume-based gradation curve of fouled ballast using 2 D images using a size correction factor on grain size...|$|E
30|$|The {{reason for}} the above trend can be {{attributed}} to the following: It is known that provision of reinforcement increases stiffness of the sand. Further mat or grid form of reinforcement provides inter locking effect, by locking the sand particles in the space/grid of the reinforcement. This restrains the lateral movement of the soil particles, causing increased cyclic resistance of reinforced sand. However, the increased cyclic resistance also depends on location or position of the reinforcement below the model footing. Due to repeated load cycles on the geogrid-reinforced soil beds, the soil particles are locked into the apertures of mat during the loading stage and prevent the full recovery of elastic and time-dependent strains to develop during the unloading stage. This is concept is known as “Dynamic Interlock”. The dynamic interlock in soil structures induces soil confining stresses as a result of the compaction process, which strengthens the reinforced soil medium. In the present experimental investigation number of layers were varied from 1, 2, 3 and 4 by varying u/B[*]=[*] 0.3 and h/B ratio was kept constant[*]=[*] 0.5 between different layers. The trend in the results indicates that the introduction of two layered reinforcement is more effective. This is due to the fact that, when two layers are placed with u/B[*]=[*] 0.3 and h/B[*]=[*] 0.5 it will lie in the probable shear failure zone below the model footing. Theoretically the depth of the shear failure zone will extend to a depth of 0.5 – 1.2  B, depending on angle of internal friction of compacted sand. For other layer configurations such as for NL[*]=[*] 3 and 4, the third and fourth layer may be located below the shear failure zone. Thus the trend in test results clearly indicates that NL[*]=[*] 2 is most effective in increase in cyclic resistance. However, it can also be noted that introduction of reinforcement causes a significant increase in cyclic resistance when compared to unreinforced sand as the number of load cycles required for the soil to yield is significantly larger when compared with that obtained for unreinforced sand. The rate of change of peak settlement and <b>residual</b> <b>settlement</b> reduces as the number of cycles increases and that a small reduction in amplitude (i.e. the difference between these two settlements) is also apparent. Often, the variation of settlement becomes stable after number cycles. This stabilizing response indicates that the early process of reorientation of particles, causing local fill stiffening, ceases relative rapidly and the system then reaches the ‘‘plastic shakedown’’ condition defined by Werkmeister et al. [24], in which subsequent deformation is fully recovered in each cycle. These values entail that the relative decrease in footing settlement for a variation of N between 1 and 2 is significantly greater than those for variation of N between 2 and 4. Despite the fact that the mass used for N[*]=[*] 1 and N[*]=[*] 2 are, respectively, two and four times of N[*]=[*] 1. Moghaddas Tafreshi and Khalaj [25] investigated the decrease in the settlement of the overlying soil surface under repeated loads can be reduced significantly by using geogrid reinforcement, while the effectiveness of the reinforcement was decreased by increasing the number of reinforcement layers.|$|E
40|$|Driven steel H-piles are {{commonly}} used in Hong Kong as the foundation to support structures. These piles are traditionally installed with termination criteria derived from Hiley's formula. However, the assumptions in Hiley's formula are not suitable for long piles. In this research, the application of wave equation analysis in deriving termination criteria for long steel H-piles founded in granitic saprolites was studied and implemented. A methodology to develop final set tables for long driven piles using wave equation analysis was outlined. To verify the performance of piles final set using the wave equation approach, two preliminary piles, PP- 1 A 2 - 2 and PP- 1 B 3 - 1, were installed based on the new termination criteria. Dynamic and static load tests were carried out on these two piles to confirm the adequacy of pile capacity. Both the pile settlement values at twice the design load and the <b>residual</b> <b>settlement</b> values were well below allowable limits. Hence, the proposed methodology can provide a cost-effective yet safe solution to long piles. Soil parameters for wave equation analyses of driven piles in 6 types of common soils in Hong Kong were also derived from a comprehensive correlation study. With these parameters, final set tables for piles of different lengths can be developed for pile construction. A Hong Kong Driven Pile Database was developed in this project using Microsoft Access. The database contains information of over 1500 piles, with complete records of 308 static load tests, 1276 dynamic tests and 257 CAPWAP analyses. It {{is one of the}} largest databases for steel H-piles in the world. To assist pile design in future projects, comprehensive searching functions are developed and demonstrated with design examples. Using the piling data in the database, the reliability of pile capacity prediction by various dynamic methods was evaluated. It is found that Hiley's formula generally underestimates the capacity of long piles. The predictions from Case's method and CAPWAP analysis are less scattered but these methods also underestimate the pile capacity. An evaluation study on 348 cases of steel H-piles founded on saprolites was also conducted to study the accuracy of driving stress predictions by the methods proposed by ICE (1954) and Bowles (1988), and by wave equation analysis. It is found that the wave equation analysis gives the best predictions among the three methods. The mean and standard deviation of the measurement-to-prediction ratio are 0. 98 and 0. 085, respectively. The load transfer in 14 instrumented long piles founded in granitic saprolites was also studied. The distributions of shaft resistance with depth were developed and the characteristics of the mobilization of both toe and shaft resistances were also studied. The Beta values and toe capacity factor Nq for granitic saprolites were back calculated. For Beta values, the mean is 0. 63 while the standard deviation is 0. 38. For toe capacity factor Nq, the mean and standard deviation are 98 and 50, respectively. Local movements of 3. 3 - 8. 3 % of pile diameter are required for substantial mobilization of the toe resistance. For substantial mobilization of shaft resistance, local movements of 1. 0 - 8. 0 % of pile diameter are required. These values are in a wider range than those for concrete piles. The pile capacity changes with time after construction, which is referred to as pile setup. The setup effect of steel H-piles founded in granitic saprolites, however, has not been sufficiently studied in the literature. In this project, the setup effect was studied through a series of dynamic tests and static load tests carried out on piles PP- 1 B 3 - 1 and PP- 1 A 2 - 2 up to 106 days after the end of driving. Setup in shaft resistance was observed while relaxation occurred at the pile toe. The setup factor Ai for completely decomposed granite was evaluated. The mean of Ai is 0. 58, which is slightly higher than those reported by Bullock et al. (2005), based on relatively short concrete piles in sand and clay. The setup factor tends to decrease with depth...|$|E
40|$|A basal {{reinforced}} piled embankment {{consists of}} a reinforced embankment on a pile foundation. The reinforcement consists {{of one or more}} horizontal layers of geosynthetic reinforcement (GR) installed {{at the base of the}} embankment. The design of the GR is the subject of this thesis. A basal reinforced piled embankment can be used for the construction of a road or a railway when a traditional construction method would require too much construction time, affect vulnerable objects nearby or give too much <b>residual</b> <b>settlement,</b> making frequent maintenance necessary. The GR strain needs to be calculated to design the GR. Multiplying this GR strain by the GR stiffness gives the tensile force, which needs to be smaller than the long-term GR tensile strength. The GR strain is calculated in two steps. Calculation step 1 divides the load – the weight of the embankment fill, road construction and traffic load – into two load parts. One part (load part A) is transferred to the piles directly. This part is relatively large because a load tends to be transferred to the stiffer parts of a construction. This mechanism is known as ‘arching’. The second, residual load part (B+C) rests on the GR (B) and the underlying subsoil (C). Calculation step 2 determines the GR strain on the basis of the result of step 1. Only the GR strips between each pair of adjacent piles are considered: they are loaded by B+C and may or may not be supported by the subsoil. The GR strain can be calculated if the distribution of load part B+C on the GR strip, the amount of subsoil support and the GR stiffness are known. An implicit result of this calculation step is the further division of load part B+C into parts B and C. Several methods for the GR design are available, all with their own models for calculation steps 1 and 2. The methods give results that differ immensely. The Dutch CUR 226 (2010) and the German EBGEO (2010) adopted Zaeske’s method (2001). However, measurements that were published later (Van Duijnen et al., 2010; Van Eekelen et al., 2015 a) showed that this method could be calculating much higher GR strains than those measured in practice, leading to heavier and more expensive designs than necessary. The objective of the present study was to establish a clearer picture of load distribution in a basal reinforced piled embankment and, on that basis, to develop and validate an analytical design model for the geosynthetic reinforcement in a piled embankment. The results were described in five papers published in the international scientific journal ‘Geotextiles and Geomembranes’. Those journal papers can be found in Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5 and Appendix A of this thesis (Van Eekelen et al., 2012 a, 2012 b, 2013, 2015 a and 2011 respectively). Chapter 2 presents a series of twelve 3 D experiments that were carried out at the Deltares laboratory. The scaled model tests were carried out under high surcharge loads to achieve stress situations comparable with those in practice. A unique feature of these tests was that load parts A, B and C could be measured separately, making it possible to compare the measurements with calculation steps 1 and 2 separately. In these tests (static load, laboratory scale), smooth relationships were obtained between the net load on the fill (surcharge load minus subsoil support) and several measured parameters such as load distribution and deformation. Consolidation of the subsoil resulted in an increase in arching (more A) and more tensile force in the GR (more B and more GR strain). The measured response to consolidation depends on the fill’s friction angle. A higher friction angle results in more arching during consolidation. One of the major conclusions based on the test series was that the load on a GR strip is approximately distributed as an inverse triangle, with the lowest pressure in the centre and higher pressure close to the piles. This conclusion was the basis for the remainder of this doctorate study and the development of the new calculation model. Chapter 3 considers calculation step 2. This chapter starts by comparing the measurements in the experiments with the calculation results of step 2 of the Zaeske (2001) model, which uses a triangular load distribution on the GR strip and considers the support of the subsoil underneath the GR strip only. It was found that Zaeske’s model calculates GR strains that are larger than the measured GR strains (approximately a factor of two for GR strains larger than 1 %). Chapter 3 continues with the suggestion of two modifications to Zaeske’s step 2. Firstly, the load distribution is changed from a triangular to an inverse triangular load distribution. Secondly, the subsoil support is extended from the support by the subsoil underneath the GR strip to the subsoil underneath the entire GR between the piles. The new step 2 model with these modifications produces a much better fit with field measurements than Zaeske’s model. Chapter 4 considers calculation step 1, the arching. Additional tests were conducted for this purpose, varying factors such as the fill height. This chapter gives an overview of the existing arching models and introduces a new model. This Concentric Arches model (CA model) is an adaptation and extension of the models of Hewlett and Randolph (1988), and Zaeske (2001), which have been adopted in several European design guidelines. Some countries use piled embankments without GR. Introducing GR changes the load distribution considerably. A major part of the load is then exerted on the piles and the residual load is mainly exerted on the GR strips between the piles, with the load being distributed approximately as an inverse triangle. Chapter 4 explains the development of the load distribution as a result of continuing GR deflection; new small arches grow within the older larger ones. Smaller arches exert less load on their subsurface. This idea is related to the concentric arches of the new model, which gives an almost perfect description of the observed load distribution in the limit state situation. Furthermore, the new model describes the influence of the fill strength and embankment height correctly. Chapter 5 compares the existing, and the newly introduced, design models with measurements from seven full-scale projects and four series of scaled model experiments. Two of these seven field projects were conducted in the Netherlands and they were carried out in part for this doctorate research. One of the four experimental series – the one presented in Chapters 2 and 4 – was conducted specifically for the present research. The other measurements were reported earlier in the literature. The calculations were carried out using mean, best-guess values for the material properties. The calculation results from the CA model match the measurements much better than the results of the arching models of Hewlett and Randolph (1988), and of Zaeske (2001). The results of the CA model are also the closest match with the results of the 3 D numerical calculations, as described in Van der Peet and Van Eekelen (2014). These authors also show that the new CA model responds better to changes in the fill friction angle than any of the other models considered. When there is no subsoil support, or almost no subsoil support, the inverse triangular load distribution on the GR strips between adjacent piles gives the best match with the measurements. When there is significant subsoil support, the load distribution is approximately uniform. This difference between the situation with or without subsoil support is understandable when one considers that most load is attracted to the construction parts that move least. In the cases with limited subsoil support, the load distribution that gives the minimum GR strain should be used to find the best match with the measurements. The GR strain calculated with Zaeske’s model is on average 2. 46 times the measured GR strain. The GR strain calculated with the new model is on average 1. 06 times the measured GR strain. The calculated GR strain is therefore almost a perfect match with the measured GR strain. The new Dutch CUR 226 (2015) has therefore adopted the model proposed in this thesis.
