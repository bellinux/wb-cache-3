40|$|Staphylococcus aureus–induced {{arthritis}} {{leads to}} severe joint destruction and high mortality despite antibiotic treatment. Thus, {{there is a}} need to identify new treatment targets in addition to antibiotic therapy. Interleukin (IL) - 15 has been implicated both in osteoclastogenesis and in bacterial clearance – two important issues in S. aureus−induced joint destruction. Interleukin- 17 A has been discovered as an important mediator of aseptic arthritis both in mice and men, while its function in <b>S.</b> aureus–induced <b>arthritis</b> is largely unknown. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the importance of IL- 15 and IL- 17 A and in addition, the interaction between IL- 17 A and interleukin- 23 in <b>S.</b> aureus−induced <b>arthritis.</b> Wildtype, IL- 15 knockout and IL- 17 A knockout mice were inoculated (systemically or locally) with a defined number of toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 (TSST- 1) producing S. aureus. At sacrifice, tissues were collected and further analysed. We found that mice genetically lacking IL- 15 or treated with anti-IL- 15 antibodies developed less severe and destructive arthritis compared with control mice. In neither situation the bacterial clearance was negatively influenced. Furthermore, the IL- 15 knockout mice had fewer osteoclasts in the joints compared with wildtype mice. We suggest that due to IL- 15 absence, the mice developed milder arthritis probably because of less bone and cartilage destruction. We observed that IL- 17 A was of minor importance in systemic <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis</b> but played a major role in local <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis.</b> In the systemic model of arthritis we found elevated levels of IL- 17 F in the IL- 17 A knockout mice, suggesting that IL- 17 F compensates for the absence of IL- 17 A and that IL- 17 F in a normal wildtype mice is inhibited by IL- 17 A. Furthermore we found that IL- 17 A regulates the production of IL- 23, a cytokine that is known to regulate the production of IL- 17 A, in a negative feedback manner, which means that IL- 17 A may have regulatory properties.

40|$|Bacterial {{arthritis}} is a severe, rapidly progressing erosive {{disease with}} high mor-bidity and mortality. Staphylococcus aureus {{is the most}} common bacterium causing this ailment. Systemic antibiotic treat-ment, with or without drainage, is the dominant therapeutic procedure. However, despite the use of antimicrobial treatment, a mortality rate of up to 20 % and joint destruction are typical. The host immune response accounts for many of the consequences of infection. Using the model of haematogenously acquired <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis</b> and sepsis we analysed host response mechanisms, and performed therapeutic approaches. Manipulations directed towards mediators of inflammation affect the course of the disease. Inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase aggravated <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis,</b> presumably by impairing bactericidal capacity of macrophages. Furthermore, complement depletion disturbed the opsonization of bacteria yielding impaired phagocytic activity of phagocytes, and interacted with the process of extravasation and migration of polymorphonuclear cells, thus aggravating the clinical course of the disease. Blocking of complement receptor 1 (CD 35) induced an increased severity of arthritis, probably via vasodilatation and neutrophil migration/extravasation augmenting action. Treatment with heparin aggravated <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis,</b> possibly interacting with the complement system and opsonophagocytosis. We provide the evidence that co-treatment of systemic corticosteroids with the conventional therapy of septic arthritis diminishes disability and severity of the disease and increases survival. This effect seems to be dependent on the downregulatory effect of corticosteroids on the proliferation/differentiation of lymphocytes. Altogether, this thesis adds to the comprehension of the overall complexity of immune responses during sepsis and septic arthritis and indicates potential therapeutic modalities...|$|R
40|$|In a newly {{developed}} mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus arthritis the kinetics of joint destruction and serological manifestations {{as well as}} the clinical course of arthritis and osteitis were studied. Almost all mice developed histopathological signs of arthritis upon a single intravenous injection of 10 (7) S. aureus LS- 1 cells. There was rapid joint destruction, with synovial hypertrophy already visible, within 24 h after injection of the bacteria. Cartilage and/or bone erosions were seen in a majority of the mice within 72 h. Extra-articular manifestations, especially signs of bone infection, were also found soon after inoculation of the bacteria. Tail osteitis was frequent (50 % of the mice) but appeared later than arthritis. Polymorphonuclear cells prevailed in the early joint lesions and were also common in the extra-articular manifestations. Within 3 days, mononuclear cells were also seen in the inflamed synovium, gaining a dominant position 3 weeks after the start of the disease. Serum interleukin- 6 levels were already increased within 6 h after bacterial injection and remained elevated throughout the course of arthritis. Serum tumor necrosis factor levels were increased within 24 h. There was a tremendous induction of immunoglobulin production, especially of the immunoglobulin G 1 isotype. This was paralleled by the production of specific antibodies to S. aureus (cell walls and toxin), as well as autoantibodies (rheumatoid factors and anti-single-stranded DNA antibodies), all predominantly of the immunoglobulin G isotype. The type and magnitude of the immunoglobulin G response together with the elevated interleukin- 6 levels speak in favor of both antigen-specific and polyclonal B-cell activation during <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis.</b> This study points out important similarities between our new model of <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis</b> and human <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis.</b> This resemblance will enable controlled studies of pathogenetic mechanisms of septic arthritis {{as well as the}}rapeutic and prophylactic approaches...|$|R
40|$|Septic {{arthritis}} is {{an inflammatory}} condition in joints caused by in situ residing bacteria {{accompanied by a}} septic reaction. Bacteria reach their target via the blood stream and the major human pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus. The local and systemic inflammation often results in irreversible cartilage and bone necrosis or, in the worst case, a lethal circulatory collapse. The regulation of immune responses following S. aureus infection is {{to a great extent}} mediated by signal proteins, called cytokines. To examine the importance of certain cytokines in this condition, S. aureus were intravenously inoculated into cytokine gene knockout mice and their respective controls. Interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) and IL- 12 gene targeted mice were studied to analyse the role of these cytokines, known to direct T cell responses towards type 2 or type 1, in <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis.</b> Further, the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alone and the combined impact of TNF and lymphotoxin-a (LTa) were investigated, since upregulation of TNF and LTa during <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis</b> and sepsis occurs. The impact of IL- 4 for the outcome of <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis</b> depends on the genetic background of the host. A detrimental effect of IL- 4 is seen in C 57 BL/ 6 mice, regarding both arthritis and death, in part due to decreased intracellular (IC) killing of staphylococci. Decreased IC killing of bacteria is seen also in macrophages derived from 129 Sv mice, but in those mice IL- 4 provides protection from septic death, probably by down-regulation of inflammatory responses. IL- 12 production is protective in <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis</b> with regard to both survival and staphylococcal clearance, possibly by induction of interferon-gamma (IFN-g). TNF/LTa protect mice from uncontrolled staphylococcal growth and septic death, showing an important role in upregulation of phagocytic activity. On the other hand production of TNF/LTa leads to increased severity of arthritis. In Staphylococcus aureus arthritis, TNF, TNF/LTa and IL- 12 attract and activate phagocytes, being directly or indirectly beneficial for reducing bacterial load, while IL- 4, down-regulates the killing of bacteria and thereby provides a favourable milieu for survival of staphylococci. Enhanced capacity of the host to reduce the numbers of staphylococci results in decreased frequency of arthritis, as shown in IL- 4 -deficient C 57 BL/ 6 mice. However, even if the ability to kill staphylococci is increased by certain cytokines joint inflammation may be worsened {{as in the case of}} TNF. With regard to survival, the capacity to kill bacteria is of importance, being positively correlated with survival, as shown in TNF/LTa-, IL- 12 - and IL- 4 -deficient C 57 BL/ 6 mice. IL- 4 down-regulates phagocytic killing of staphylococci also in another genetic background, but in these IL- 4 -deficient mice the absence of IL- 4 is fatal. Though basic properties attributed to a cytokine in one genetic background might be true also in a second one, the final outcome of disease depends on the milieu in which they act. The results, if applicable in human <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis,</b> suggest that interactions with cytokines may be used to: (I) increase phagocytic activity, and/or (II) down-regulate an overheated immune system, i. e. to decrease destruction of joints and/or prevent septic shock...|$|R
40|$|Activation of Ras {{proteins}} underlies functional {{decisions in}} diverse cell types.

Combining in silico and in vitro studies, we demonstrate that "digital" signaling in lymphocytes (cells are "on" or "off") is predicated on this allosteric regulation of SOS. The SOS feedback loop leads to hysteresis in the dose-response curve, which may enable T cells to exhibit "memory" of past encounters with antigen. Ras activation by Ras-GRP alone is "analog" (a graded increase in activation in response to an increase in the amplitude of the stimulus). We describe how the complementary analog (Ras-GRP) and digital (SOS) pathways act on Ras to efficiently convert analog input to digital output and make predictions regarding the importance of digital signaling in lymphocyte function and development. available in PMC 2009 October 1; A presentation from the EMBO workshop "Visualizing Immune System Complexity," Centre d'Immunologie Marseille-Luminy, Marseille, France, 15 to 17 January 2009.

This has prompted us to investigate the importance of IL- 15 in <b>S.</b> aureus-induced <b>arthritis.</b> Methods. Toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 producing S. aureus was intravenously inoculated in IL- 15 knockout and wildtype mice and in wildtype mice treated with anti-IL- 15 antibodies (aIL- 15 ab) or isotype control antibody. Results. Absence of IL- 15, either in knockout mice or after treatment with aIL- 15 ab, significantly reduced weight loss compared with controls during the infection. The severity of synovitis and joint destruction was significantly decreased in IL- 15 knockout and aIL- 15 ab treated mice compared with controls.

To determine the host's contribution in the joint destruction of <b>S.</b> aureus-mediated septic <b>arthritis,</b> we analyzed the MMP expression profile in human dermal and synovial fibroblasts upon exposure to culture supernatant and whole cell lysates of S. aureus.

The MMP expression profile was similar in fibroblasts exposed to a combination of IL- 1 /TNF. mRNA levels of several genes of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway were significantly elevated in fibroblasts treated with S. aureus cell lysate and culture supernatant. Also, tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly higher in fibroblasts treated with S. aureus components.

Recent data show that the TSST- 1 molecule is composed of two distinct domains, one proposed to interact with T cell receptor (TCR) and one with the MHC class II. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess if interaction between TSST- 1 -specific MoAbs directed to sites on the MHC and/or TCR Vβ affects the development of experimental <b>S.</b> aureus-induced <b>arthritis.</b> For that purpose we used a panel of seven MoAbs, which were injected intraperitoneally before and after inoculation with a TSST- 1 -producing S. aureus strain. Administration of antibodies did not affect the development of arthritis, suggesting inefficacy of such a procedure in neutralization of exotoxin-mediated disease manifestations...|$|R
40|$|Septic {{arthritis}} is {{a common}} and feared complication of staphylococcal infections. Staphylococcus aureus produces a number of potential virulence factors including certain adhesins and enterotoxins. In this study we have assessed the roles of cytolytic toxins {{in the development of}} septic arthritis by inoculating mice with S. aureus wild-type strain 8325 - 4 or isogenic mutants differing in the expression of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-toxin production patterns. Mice inoculated with either an alpha- or beta-toxin mutant showed degrees of inflammation, joint damage, and weight decrease similar to wild-type-inoculated mice. In contrast, mice inoculated with either double (alpha- and gamma-toxin-deficient) - or triple (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-toxin-deficient) -mutant S. aureus strains showed lower frequency and severity of arthritis, measured both clinically and histologically, than mice inoculated with the wild-type strain. We conclude that simultaneous production of alpha- and gamma-toxin is a virulence factor in <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis...</b>|$|R

40|$|Staphyllococcus aureus-induced infections often {{result in}} high {{mortality}} and permanent joint destruction, despite treatment with antibiotics. IL- 10 is typically {{regarded as an}} anti-inflammatory cytokine because it promotes a T helper cell type 2 response, and subsequently down-regulates cell mediated immune functions. To investigate the role of IL- 10 in <b>S.</b> aureus-induced <b>arthritis</b> and sepsis, Balb/c mice, intact or defective with respect to IL- 10 gene were intravenously inoculated with bacteria. IL- 10 −/− mice develop a more frequent and destructive arthritis compared to their congeneic controls. The mechanisms regulating such outcome may be due {{not only to the}} anti-inflammatory properties of IL- 10 but also, directly or indirectly, to antibacterial features of this molecule. Indeed, inoculation of staphylococci to IL- 10 −/− mice resulted in higher bacterial load in blood and kidneys compared to congeneic controls. Altogether our data indicate that IL- 10 is essential for efficient elimination of bacteria and thereby for protection against septic arthritis...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcal enterotoxins A through D (SEA through SED) {{and toxic}} shock {{syndrome}} toxin- 1 display superantigen properties, i. e., they stimulate a great fraction of T cells expressing certain T-cell receptor V beta sequences. Using a newly established rat model of septic Staphylococcus aureus arthritis, we have recently shown that an S. aureus strain producing SEA showed marked arthritogenic properties. In {{the present study}} we decided to employ another five S. aureus strains, each one producing a distinct exotoxin. Almost all rats injected with superantigen-producing strains developed arthritis. In contrast, only 20 % of rats injected with an S. aureus strain lacking superantigen production displayed mild and transient arthritis. Mortality was preferentially induced among the rats inoculated with the S. aureus strains producing SEB and SED. This study emphasizes that superantigen production is an important virulence factor {{in the development of}} septic <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis.</b> Differences concerning mortality between staphylococcal strains producing different exotoxins may be dependent on the degree of activation of the immune system...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of the fibrinogen-binding adhesin clumping factor A (ClfA) in the pathogen-esis of Staphylococcus aureus septic arthritis was examined in an animal model. The protective effect of active and passive immunization with ClfA also was investigated in S. aureus infection models. The severity of arthritis was markedly reduced in mice challenged intravenously with a clfA mutant, compared with mice infected with the wild-type strain. Mice immunized with recombinant ClfA and challenged with S. aureus developed less-severe arthritis than did mice immunized with a control antigen. Passive immunization of mice with rat and rabbit anti-ClfA antibodies protected against <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis</b> and sepsis-induced death, indicating that the protection by active immunization is antibody mediated. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that ClfA is a crucial virulence determinant for septic arthritis and an excel-lent target for the generation of immune therapies directed against S. aureus. Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen that causes diverse infections, ranging from superficial skin infections to invasive and potentially life-threatening infections, such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and septic <b>arthritis</b> [1]. <b>S.</b> aureus i...|$|R
40|$|Joint {{infection}} {{caused by}} Staphylococcus aureus leads to heavy synovitis and rapid destruction of bone and cartilage. Permanent loss of joint function {{is seen in}} 20 - 50 % of the patients, despite early eradication of the bacteria with antibiotics. The morality rate, 5 - 25 %, is due to an exaggerated immunological reaction by the host {{in response to the}} bacteria. The mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not fully understood. The murine model of hematogenously induced S. aureus sepsis and septic arthritis provides unique possibilities tostudy the host-bacterium relationship. Using this model we have analysed the role of B lymphocytes and their products for the development and progression of <b>S.</b> aureus induced <b>arthritis</b> and sepsis. We have found that mice completely devoided of mature B cells and immunoglobulins (µ-MT-mice) and CD 22 -deficient mice (having a 75 % reduction of marginal zone B cells) do not differ in the outcome of <b>S.</b> aureus induced <b>arthritis</b> and sepsis as compared to intactcontrol mice. Neither did mice deficient for the activational IgG receptors, FcgRI and FcgRIII, differ in rate and severity of arthritis or mortality numbers, as compared to control mice. Incontrast, presence of FcgRIIb led to increased mortality rate as compared to FcgRIIb knockout mice, probably due to decreased phagoyctosis and impaired bacterial clearance. In addition, FcgRIIb-deficient animals displayed elevated levels of protecting Clumping factor A antibodies and IL- 10 as compared to controls, both contributing to host protection. Further, we have shown that mice deficient for IL- 10 exhibited aggravated arthritis and an increasedbacterial load. Exploring the intracellular cytokine content in B cells, we found that stimulation in particular with TSST- 1 led to a substantial production of IFN-g early during the infection. The number of B cells expressing IL- 10 or IL- 4 increased {{during the first week of}} infection contributing to a diminished number of IFN-g positive cells. Thus, mature B cells and their products do not contribute to host protection or pathogenicity of <b>S.</b> aureus induced <b>arthritis</b> and sepsis. Absence of FcgRIIb decreases the mortality probably due to increased bacterial clearance and elevated IL- 10 levels in additionto production of protective Clumping factor A antibodies. The presence of IL- 10 per se contributes to increased bacterial clearance and amelioration of the arthritis...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{arthritis}} is {{a rapidly}} progressive and highly erosive {{disease of the}} joints in which both host and bacterial factors are of pathogenic importance. One potential bacterial virulence factor {{is the ability to}} express a polysaccharide capsule (CP). Among 11 reported capsular serotypes, CP type 5 (CP 5) and CP 8 comprise 80 to 85 % of all clinical blood isolates. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the role of CP 5 as a virulence factor in staphylococcal septicemia and septic arthritis with a recently established murine model of hematogenously spread <b>S.</b> aureus <b>arthritis.</b> NMRI mice were inoculated intravenously with S. aureus strains isogenic for expression of CP 5, and clinical, bacteriological, serological, and histopathological progression of disease was studied. Inoculation of 7 x 10 (6) CFU of S. aureus per mouse induced 55 % mortality in the group inoculated with the CP-expressing bacteria, compared to 18 % in the group inoculated with CP- mutants. A lower dose of inoculum (3 x 10 [6] per mouse) did not give rise to mortality in mice inoculated with CP mutant strains, whereas 18 % of the mice inoculated with the CP 5 -expressing S. aureus died. Importantly, mice inoculated with S. aureus expressing CP 5 had a significantly higher frequency of arthritis and a more severe form of the disease. In vitro assays suggested that macrophages were not able to phagocytize CP 5 + staphylococci as efficiently as they were CP 5 - strains. In addition, once phagocytized, CP 5 + bacteria were less efficiently killed than CP- mutants. In summary, CP 5 leads to a higher frequency of arthritis and a more severe course of the disease. This seems to be related to the effects of the downregulatory properties of CP on the ingestion and intracellular killing capacity of phagocytes. Our results clearly indicate that the expression of CP 5 is a determinant of the virulence of <b>S.</b> aureus in <b>arthritis</b> and septicemia...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Treatment, and {{therefore}} outcome, of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) will improve {{in the next}} few years. However, improvement in outcome can only be judged against the probability of certain outcomes with current conventional treatment.  AIM—To document the five year outcome of RA in the late 1990 <b>s.</b>  SETTING—Norfolk <b>Arthritis</b> Register (NOAR).  DESIGN—Longitudinal observational cohort study.  METHODS— 318 patients with recent onset inflammatory polyarthritis recruited by NOAR in 1990 - 91 completed five years of follow up. Four groups were assessed: the whole cohort, all those referred to hospital, those who satisfied criteria for RA at baseline, and those referred to hospital who satisfied criteria for RA at baseline. Outcome was assessed with a visual analogue scale for pain, the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and the Short Form- 36 (SF- 36).  RESULTS—Of the RA hospital attenders, 50 % had a visual analogue scale pain score of 5  cm or less and an HAQ score of 1. 125  or less. SF- 36 scores were reduced in all domains. Results are presented as cumulative percentages.  CONCLUSIONS—These results can be used for comparison and to set targets for improvement. ...|$|R
