In his early days at the paper, he was bylined 'Pascoe Watson' as his superiors thought the forename George and his double-barrelled surname to be too effete for the <b>red-top's</b> primarily working-class readership.

5000|$|A middle-market {{newspaper}} {{is one that}} attempts to cater to readers who want some entertainment from their newspaper {{as well as the}} coverage of important news events.

In the United Kingdom, since the demise of Today (1986-1995), the only national middle-market papers are the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, distinguishable by their black-top masthead (both use the easy-to-carry tabloid paper size), as opposed to the <b>red-top</b> mastheads of down-market tabloids.|$|E

Hackett’s key task was to launch an irreverent midweek colour supplement, a challenge which was arguably of greater cultural significance than Nova. The Mirror was not only a serious-minded left-wing daily paper, but also in Cudlipp’s view, “the first quality popular paper”. [...] Within that decade, only quality newspapers had launched glossy colour supplements (Sunday Times, Sunday Telegraph, Observer), all of which had delivered boosts to their papers’ circulations.|$|E

50|$|Collection {{of blood}} in clot tubes for serum {{chemistry}} analysis permits the metabolism of glucose in the sample by blood cells until separated by centrifugation. Red blood cells, for instance, do not require insulin to intake glucose from the blood. Higher than normal amounts of white or red blood cell counts can lead to excessive glycolysis in the sample, with substantial reduction of glucose level if the sample is not processed quickly. Ambient temperature at which the blood sample is kept prior to centrifuging and separation of plasma/serum also affects glucose levels. At refrigerator temperatures, glucose remains relatively stable for several hours in a blood sample. Loss of glucose can be prevented by using Fluoride tubes (i.e., gray-top) since fluoride inhibits glycolysis. However, these should only be used when blood will be transported from one hospital laboratory to another for glucose measurement. <b>Red-top</b> serum separator tubes also preserve glucose in samples after being centrifuged isolating the serum from cells.|$|E
5000|$|The 2009 British investigative {{documentary}} Starsuckers {{exposed the}} request to obtain medical records of celebrities {{by many of}} the <b>red-top</b> UK tabloids, and the lack of PCC action against the papers that had broken the PCC charter.

Secretly interviewed reporters claimed that [...] "the PCC is run by the newspaper Editors", [...] "Getting a PCC isn't great, but, a lot of papers just brush it aside, all it is, is a little apology somewhere in the paper, you get a slap on the wrist, you get reported by the PCC, but there's no money". The PCC took no action against the papers that ran these stories but did respond with a letter to the Editor of The Belfast Telegraph. The response of Chris Atkins, the documentary's director, was that the PCC had yet still not acted on the issue of several newspapers breaking their Code of conduct 8.2.|$|E
50|$|Someone from Tri-State Land Company {{decided to}} name the {{community}} Red Top. The popular legend is that the community is named after Olivia Matilda Erickson, the red-haired Swedish immigrant girl {{who worked as a}} cook at various enterprises undertaken by members of the Haggberg families. She worked at John Haggberg’s Mill, at Al Haggberg’s Boarding House, at The Haggberg Hotel in Isle, and probably several other places. The sawmill, {{near the center of the}} community, was in fact already known as the Red Top Saw Mill. There are those who disagree that the town is named after Olivia Erickson or the mill and claim it is named after the <b>red-top</b> field grass (Agrostis alba) that grows in the area. The fact remains that Olivia’s nickname was Redtop. Positive proof of the origin of Red Top’s name is gone forever, since the Soo Line discarded the original survey notes in the early 1960s. Ultimately Olivia Erickson married Julius Olson, and moved to the Pine City area, where she lived to age 90 and a month.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a study that}} examined what citizen journalism on Twitter has meant for the professional identity and working practices of British sport journalists, using data {{from a series of}} in-depth, semistructured interviews. Sport journalists recognized the need to strive for higher professional standards to ensure that their output is of greater cultural significance than that of citizen journalists. Trust—achieved through the ideologies of truth, reliability, and insight—was seen as essential to achieving this distinction. The democratization of breaking news has meant that <b>red-top</b> tabloid and 24 -hr rolling news environments must reinvent themselves by making greater use of other journalistic practices including investigative reporting...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Iron mining in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula has unavoidably {{impacted}} regulated wetlands. State {{and federal}} laws require these wetland impacts be mitigated by the creation or restoration of compensatory wetlands. Integrating wetland creation with tailings basin reclamation provided the necessary wetland acreage for regulatory compliance. The {{properties of the}} tailings and {{the design of the}} basins provided not only a suitable medium and location for wetland creation, but also presented substantial challenges. The creation of new wetlands required manipulation of the water levels within the basins and careful wetland design. Michigan Department of Environmental Quality permits required creating emergent, scrub/shrub, and forested wetland communities on neutral tailings. Numerous planting and seeding techniques were used to establish the different plant communities. These techniques included dormant seeding, drill seeding, aerial seeding, and transplanting wetland vegetation. Cover crops of Japanese millet (Echinochloa crusgalli) and <b>red-top</b> grass (Argrostis alba) were used in conjunction with hay mulch minimize erosion and sequester wind blown seeds from the surrounding native areas. Forested wetlands were established by transplanting wetland tree species at specific tree densities to compensate for expected mortality. The established wetland communities were monitored annually for a period five years to document the successful development of vegetation, hydrology, and wildlife in accordance with reclamation success criteria. Additional Key Words: replacement wetlands, mitigation, tailings reclamation, revegetation, restoration techniques...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} a cross-national {{comparison of}} readership {{responses to the}} British tabloid The Sun and the German <b>red-top</b> Bild. The study is of qualitative nature: it draws on extensive material derived from a total of 18 focus groups conducted in both countries, in which 104 diverse adults participated. The first study to compare tabloid reading experience cross-nationally, the research sets out to explore how readers of The Sun and readers of Bild {{make sense of the}} papers, and how they evaluate them. The results are analysed with regards to emerging similarities and differences, which are pointed out and discussed in relation to the specific social and cultural contexts in the UK and Germany. While many academic approaches to genre consider popular newspapers hazardous to the workings of democratic society; this study takes a different approach. Drawing on a range of academic ideas that can largely be associated to the intellectual tradition of ‘cultural studies’, the research foregrounds the social and cultural functions of the popular press from the readers’ point of view; focussing in particular on notions of belonging and community as expressed in the construction of citizenship, social participation and collective identity formations. Among the key results of the study, cross-nationally shared modes of engagement with tabloids are highlighted, which contribute to an often tension-filled character of the reading experience. Moreover, the papers’ highly stimulating potential is stressed. I develop my idea of the ‘negotiative space’ generated by tabloids; arguing that this greatly contributes to readers’ development of their ‘vision of the good and bad’. Moreover, the thesis emphasises the significance of the popular press to various kinds of readers’ social and cultural identity formations; particularly with regards to notions of nationhood and national identity...|$|E
