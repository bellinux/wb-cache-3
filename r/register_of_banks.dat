40|$|Abstract — Register file banking is an {{effective}} alternative to monolithic register files in embedded processor based systems. In this work, we propose techniques for performing application specific customization <b>of</b> <b>register</b> file <b>banking</b> structure. First, we propose two techniques based on (i) profiling and (ii) static application analysis {{to arrive at a}} customized energy-efficient bank configuration for a given application on a dual bank register file. We also propose a technique to extend the exploration to a multi-bank register file architecture and an associated register allocation algorithm for further power reduction. This reduces register file power consumption by allocating variables in frequently accessed basic blocks to separate appropriately sized <b>register</b> file <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> active <b>registers.</b> Experimental results indicate that our customized dual bank configuration inferred by both techniques gives energy savings of 40 % over a monolithic register file, and the multi-bank register file customization gives a further 15 - 20 % energy savings.

Lower interest rates, by contrast, reduce the credit risk of outstanding loans. Loan credit risk is maximized when both interest rates are very low prior to loan origination and interest rates are very high {{over the life of the}} loan. Our results suggest that low interest rates increase bank risk-taking, reduce credit risk in banks in the very short run but worsen it in the medium run. Risk-taking is not equal for all type <b>of</b> banks: Small <b>banks,</b> banks with fewer lending opportunities, banks with less sophisticated depositors, and savings or cooperative banks take on more extra risk than other banks when interest rates are lower.

40|$|Designing {{high-performance}} low-power <b>register</b> files is <b>of</b> {{critical importance}} to the continuation of current performance advances in wide-issue and deeply-pipelined superscalar microprocessors.

The <b>register</b> bit-widths <b>of</b> different <b>banks</b> in our AB-VARF register files are specifically customized to capture different narrow-width values. Augmented with a value width predictor, the register renaming logic is slightly tuned to rename predicted narrow-width registers to the corresponding narrow-width banks.
