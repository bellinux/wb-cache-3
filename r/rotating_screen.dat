40|$|The {{development}} of a 10 -channel rotating pressure measuring system capable of operation to speeds of 9000 rpm at transducer temperatures of about 320 K (120 F) is described. Variable-reluctance pressure transducers were mounted in the rotating system for sensing pressure. Rotating performance tests on a spin rig showed that the output data from 7 of the 10 transducers tested were within a desired system error of 3 percent. However, the error of the output data from three other transducers was as large as 8 percent of 9000 rpm. It was concluded from these test results that a <b>rotating</b> <b>screening</b> method was necessary to evaluate each pressure transducer channel within a system {{that will be used}} under rotating conditions...|$|R

The external form is defined by translucent glass block walls, with select areas of clear glazing for transparency. Internally, spatial division is variable by the use of sliding, folding or <b>rotating</b> <b>screens</b> in glass, sheet or perforated metal, or in combination.

40|$|Color-to-color {{misregistration}} {{refers to}} misregistration between color separations in a printed or display image. Such misregistration in printed halftoned images {{can result in}} several image defects, a primary one being shifts in average color. The present paper examines the variation in average color for two-color halftoned images {{as a function of}} color-to-color misregistration distance. Dot-on-dot/dot-off-dot and <b>rotated</b> dot <b>screen</b> configurations are examined via simulation and supported by print measurements. The color and color shifts were calculated using a spectral Neugebauer model for the underlying simulations. As expected, dot-on-dot/dot-off-dot color shifts were very high, while <b>rotated</b> dots <b>screens</b> exhibited very little color shift under the present idealized conditions. The simulations also demonstrate that optical dot gain significantly reduces the color shifts seen in practice...|$|R

50|$|Two {{simplifying}} {{assumptions are}} made in the equation presented in this section for the residence time of materials in a <b>rotating</b> <b>screen.</b> First, it is assumed that there is no slippage of particles on the screen. In addition, the particles dislodging from the screen are under free fall. When the drum rotates, particles are kept in contact with the rotating wall by centrifugal force. As the particles reach {{near the top of the}} drum, the gravitational force acting in the radial direction overcomes the centrifugal force, causing the particles to fall from the drum in a cataracting motion. The force components acting on the particle at the point of departure is illustrated in Figure 6.|$|E

5000|$|Both {{reactors}} use Delaware Bay as {{a source}} of cooling water.

[...] All of the waste heat produced in the steam cycle (about 2 gigawatts) is dumped into the bay.

50|$|The {{battles of}} Dragon Seeds are fought in {{traditional}} 1 vs 1 matches, on a semi <b>rotating</b> <b>screen</b> between the player and the challenger's dragons. The battle is fought in turn-based rock, paper, scissors rotations with a timer that counts down during each player's phase of action. The player can command the dragon to either move forward, backward, use a physical or magical attack, defend, or taunt. The player must equip the dragon {{with a weapon}} and shield, called a reflector, for the dragon {{to be able to}} enter combat. In battle, there are 3 main positions in which the dragon can be in: Close, Mid, and Far range. Each dragon can be at max 2 ranges apart from their opponent. Only at close range can a dragon successfully perform a physical attack. At mid and far ranges, the dragon can perform magical attacks attuned with their element, or taunt. The player must choose correct judgment and a bit of luck to win battles successfully.|$|E
5000|$|Live For You! sold 44,000 {{copies in}} its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the fifth best-selling video game in Japan that week. The game {{received}} a score of 28 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu. The game {{has been described as}} akin to a fan disc that would be hard to play if the player did not already have an emotional attachment to the idols. For this reason, Takeshi Iizuka writing for ASCII Media Works strongly recommends playing the Xbox 360 port of The Idolmaster and producing two or three idols before playing Live For You!. Iizuka notes the large differences between the easy, medium and hard modes when playing the support mode, in addition to the varied difficulty between songs. [...] "Go My Way!!" [...] and [...] in particular are called the most difficult songs to play on hard. During the support mode, the rhythm minigame is described as difficult to focus on if the player also wants to focus on aspects of the idols' performance. The <b>rotating</b> <b>screen</b> during the special appeals to the audience is also called distracting. The game's photography mode was criticized for only allowing the last five photos to be viewable {{at the end of the}} performance and for only one video being allowed to be saved at a time. The communication portion of the game is also criticized as being somewhat insufficient.|$|E
40|$|The <b>rotating</b> <b>screen</b> drums {{are largely}} used in most powder {{handling}} and processing industries. They {{are commonly used}} for size separation of granular materials. Objectives of the present work are to better understand both roles, screening efficiency and shaping effects and to investigate and model which process parameters are relevant when using an inclined <b>rotating</b> <b>screen</b> drum for processing wet couscous agglomerates. Durum wheat semolina was used as raw material to produce the wet agglomerates. The pilot <b>rotating</b> <b>screen</b> drum equipment was composed of two sieves to separate three fractions: fine, medium, and large agglomerates. The shaping effects of the <b>rotating</b> <b>screen</b> drum were evaluated from the measurements of the physico-chemical characteristics (size distribution, water content, compactness, and circularity) on wet soft agglomerates. To describe the screening efficiency parameters of a rotary screen drum, a specific method was developed by using a matrix analysis of the different measured weights of the collected products. The impacts of <b>rotating</b> <b>screen</b> drum parameters (angle of inclination, rotating speed, and product flow rate) on the sieving efficiency and on the shaping effects were investigated. The present results demonstrate high apparent screening efficiency of the <b>rotating</b> <b>screen</b> drum when used with wet agglomerates of durum wheat, ranging between 89 and 96 % depending on the process conditions Finally, using dimensional analysis, two correlations were proposed on the circularity and the apparent screening efficiency whatever the operating conditions used (drum speed, angle of inclination and feed rate) ...|$|E
