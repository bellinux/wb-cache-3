25|$|The first {{train to}} reach Galveston left Houston {{on the morning}} of September 8 at 9:45a.m. It found the tracks washed out, and {{passengers}} were forced to transfer to a <b>relief</b> <b>train</b> on parallel tracks to complete their journey. Even then, debris on the track slowed the train's progress to a crawl. The 95 travelers on the train from Beaumont found themselves at the Bolivar Peninsula waiting for the ferry that would carry them, train and all, to the island. When it arrived, the high seas forced the ferry captain to give up on his attempt to dock. The train crew attempted to return the way they had come, but rising water blocked the train's path.|$|E
25|$|The last {{scheduled}} {{passenger trains}} hauled by 5700s on BR were on seen London Midland Region on the Wrexham to New Brighton route (passing over old LNER territory). The Wrexham to Seacombe service ended {{at the beginning}} of 1960 but was immediately replaced by a Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) service between Wrexham and New Brighton. The service on Bank Holidays was so popular that demand outstripped available DMUs, and a <b>relief</b> <b>train</b> of four coaches pulled by No. 3749 was laid on. Two more 5700s were used over the Spring Bank Holiday that year, but from then BR Standard Class 4 2-6-4T locomotives usually handled the relief services. In 1965 5700s were used for the last time on Whit Monday and August Bank Holiday relief services.|$|E

The Miami Red Cross Citizens Relief Committee, which was established to provide aid for victims of the storm, transported [...] "hundreds of loaves of bread, gallons of milk, pounds of coffee and sugar, blankets, cots, and medical supplies." [...] The first <b>relief</b> <b>train</b> was ridden by U.S. Senator Joseph T. Robinson, the Democratic vice presidential nominee during the election that year. At least 100people were brought to Miami for medical treatment. In Lake Worth, 25people were treated for various injuries at the Gulf Stream Hotel and the local fire station. Dr. W. A.

2500|$|Anticipating American {{entry into}} World War I in early 1917, McCall formed the Massachusetts Public Safety Commission, an {{emergency}} response and relief organization {{that was the}} first of its type in the nation. Coordinating a wide array of public and charitable organizations and major businesses, the commission {{played a significant role in}} providing relief and other services until it was disbanded in 1918. One of its most important actions was coordinating the state's response to the Halifax Explosion of December 6, 1917. With only fragmentary reports received early after a blast devastated the Nova Scotia city of Halifax, McCall called the committee into action, and offered unlimited assistance to the stricken city. [...] The state organized a major <b>relief</b> <b>train</b> (even before the full extent of the disaster was known) that was among the first to reach Halifax, and the committee's representatives assisted in organizing relief activities on the ground. [...] Temporary housing built in Halifax was named in McCall's honor, and the state's relief efforts continue to be recognized today by Nova Scotia's annual gift of a Christmas tree to the city of Boston.|$|E
