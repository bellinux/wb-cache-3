Targets appeared among distractor symbols either close to or far from the display center, and participants were instructed to find the target closest to the center.

40|$|The {{threat of}} {{lightning}} {{is a daily}} concern during the warm season in Florida. Research has revealed distinct spatial and temporal distributions of lightning occurrence that are strongly influenced by large-scale atmospheric flow regimes. Previously, the Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) calculated the gridded lightning climatologies based on seven flow regimes over Florida for 1 -, 3 - and 6 -hr intervals in 5 -, 10 -, 20 -, and 30 -NM diameter <b>range</b> <b>rings</b> around the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) and eight other airfields in the National Weather Service in Melbourne (NWS MLB) county warning area (CWA). In this update to the work, the AMU recalculated the lightning climatologies for using individual lightning strike data to improve {{the accuracy of the}} climatologies. The AMU included all data regardless of flow regime as one of the stratifications, added monthly stratifications, added three years of data to the period of record and used modified flow regimes based work from the AMU's Objective Lightning Probability Forecast Tool, Phase II. The AMU made changes so the 5 - and 10 -NM radius <b>range</b> <b>rings</b> are consistent with the aviation forecast requirements at NWS MLB, while the 20 - and 30 -NM radius <b>range</b> <b>rings</b> at the SLF assist the Spaceflight Meteorology Group in making forecasts for weather Flight Rule violations during Shuttle landings. The AMU also updated the graphical user interface with the new data...|$|R

40|$|We reduced time {{to detect}} target symbols in mock radar screens by adding perceptual {{boundaries}} that partitioned displays {{in accordance with}} task instructions. Targets appeared among distractor symbols either close to or far from the display center, and participants were instructed to find the target closest to the center. Search time increased with both number of distractors and distance of target from center. However, when close and far regions were delineated by a centrally presented 2 ̆ 2 <b>range</b> <b>ring,</b> 2 ̆ 2 the distractor effect was substantially reduced. In addition, eye movement patterns more closely resembled a task-efficient spiral when displays contained a <b>range</b> <b>ring.</b> Results suggest that the addition of perceptual boundaries to visual displays can help to guide search in accordance with task-directed constraints. Actual or potential applications of this research include the incorporation of perceptual boundaries into display designs {{in order to encourage}} task-efficient scanpaths (as identified via task analysis and/or empirical testing) ...|$|R
