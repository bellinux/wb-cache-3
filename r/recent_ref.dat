This note exposes a number of potential inconsistencies between the previously made holographic predictions and advocates for a compelling need to systematically contrast the latter against the results of alternate, more conventional, approaches as well as experimental data.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss a view {{concerning}} key datasets of the properties of grain boundaries in high-Tc superconductors that was recently expressed in Ref. [1]. The reference also criticizes our research. Using examples I disprove this criticism. 1 Grain boundaries in high-Tc superconductors are a topic of intense interest. Their low critical current densities provide a severe obstacle for the realization of superconducting wires that operate at 77 K. It is therefore important that the critical currents can be significantly enhanced if the grains are aligned, as reported by my colleagues and myself, for example in [2, 3]. Our finding provides the basis for the development of state-of-the-art high-Tc wires, the so-called coated conductors. This field is very active, and many groups have made outstanding contributions.

40|$|How does {{scientific}} research affect {{the world around}} us? Being able {{to answer this question}} is of great importance in order to appropriately channel efforts and resources in science. The impact by scientists in academia is currently measured by citation based metrics such as h-index, i-index and citation counts. These academic metrics aim to represent the dissemination of knowledge among scientists rather than the impact of the research on the wider world. In this work we are interested in measuring scientific impact beyond academia, on the economy, society, health and legislation (comprehensive impact). Indeed scientists are asked to demonstrate evidence of such comprehensive impact by authoring case studies {{in the context of the}} Research Excellence Framework (REF). We first investigate the extent to which existing citation based metrics can be indicative of comprehensive impact.

OUTP- 97 - 10 P hep-ph/ 9702403 February 1997 1 The temperature-induced phase transition of the O(N) Linear σ Model (LσM) has recently attracted renewed interest, especially {{as a model of}} the chiral phase transition that might be triggered by certain ultrarelativistic collisions of hadrons or nuclei. While some of the relevant experimental signatures, such as the ones associated to disoriented chiral condensates (see, e. g., Refs.

40|$|In June 2014, the University of Northampton {{hosted the}} PopLife Popular Music Studies conference. As {{part of the}} {{proceedings}} three BA Popular Music students from the University delivered papers, presenting them {{with the opportunity to}} engage with a wider research community. The success of the panel prompted Yoshe Watson, one of the students involved, to put forward the idea of an undergraduate PMS conference open to students from across the UK and beyond. This conference, U:Pop (www. u-pop. org), will be held in Northampton on the 30 th May 2015, launching a broader international undergraduate research network that will connect students, academics and industry professionals. This paper will reflect both upon the U:Pop conference after the event and the opportunities and challenges of formulating the proposed research network to follow it. Whilst undergraduate research networks currently operate in other disciplines, particularly in the US, there are few platforms for undergraduate students working in PMS to develop independent research and scholarship outside of their immediate curriculum. Focusing on the recommendations of Healy and Jenkins’ (2009) HEA report into developing undergraduate research and inquiry, this paper will plot out the possible ways by which students can develop their scholarship, and engage with PMS research communities beyond their own institutions. Through opportunities to present and publish research, to engage with scholars in the field of PMS, to develop methodological and pedagogical skills and network both with academic and industrial partners, the research network will seek to meet a number of objectives relevant to the current academic research climate. It will create academic and industrial opportunities for students, foster the self-perception of undergraduates as active researchers who are a new generation of PMS scholars, and it will act as a pathway towards postgraduate study. The network will also foster cross-institutional collaboration, develop undergraduate research skills both within and without curricula, and, in light of the <b>recent</b> <b>REF</b> assessment, promote academic research that has real social impact.

40|$|Inequalities lie at {{the heart}} of a great deal of mathematics. G. H. Hardy {{reported}} Harald Bohr as saying `all analysts spend half their time hunting through the literature for inequalities which they want to use but cannot prove'. Inequalities involving means open many doors for analysts e. g generalization of mixed means fallouts the re�nements to the important inequalities of Holder and Minkowski. The well known Jensen's inequality asserts a remarkable relation among the mean and the mean of function values and any improvement or ref nements of Jensen's inequality is a source to enrichment of monotone property of mixed means. our aim is to utilize all known ref nements of Jensen's inequality to give the ref nements of inequality among the power means by newly de�ned mixed symmetric means. In this context, our results not only ensures the generalization of classical but also speak about the most recent notions (e. g n-exponential convexity) of this era. In first chapter we start with few basic notions about means and convex functions. Then the classical Jensen's inequality and the historical results about re�nements of Jensen's inequality are given from the literature together with their applications to the mixed symmetric means. In second chapter we consider <b>recent</b> <b>ref</b> nements of Jensen's inequality to re�ne inequality between power means by mixed symmetric means with positive weights under more comprehensive settings of index set. A new re�nement of the classical Jensen's inequality is also established. The Popovicui type inequality is generalized using green function. Using these ref nements we define various versions of linear functionals that are positive on convex functions. This step ultimately leads us to the important and recently revitalized area of exponential convexity. Mean value theorems are proved for these functionals. Some non-trivial examples of exponential convexity and some classes of Cauchy means are given. These examples are further used to show monotonicity in de�ning parameters of constructed Cauchy means. In third chapter we develop the re�nements of discrete Jensen's inequality for convex functions of several variables which causes the generalizations of Beck's results. The consequences of Beck's results are given in more general settings. We also generalize the inequalities of H�older and Minkowski by using the Quasiarithmetic mean function. In forth chapter we investigate the class of self-adjoint operators de�ned on a Hilbert space, whose spectra are contained in an interval. We extend several re- nements of the discrete Jensen's inequality for convex functions to operator convex functions. The mixed symmetric operator means are de ned for a subclass of positive self-adjoint operators to give the re nements of inequality between power means of strictly positive operators. In last chapter, some new ref nements are given for Jensen's type inequalities involving the determinants of positive def nite matrices. Bellman-Bergstrom-Fan functionals are considered. These functionals are not only concave, but superlinear which is a stronger condition. The results take advantage of this property...|$|E

We argue that if they are clustered with bright ones then a physical resolution of ~ 10 kpc. will be needed to to distinguish their 21 -cm. and QSO Absorption Line(QSOAL) counterparts from their brighter neighbours, leading to a real possibility of confusion. But until now such a resolution has not been available in this context. New Very Large Array (VLA) observations reveal that the identifications with bright optical objects claimed in previous single-dish blind HI surveys are often unreliable. For instance 14 / 36 of our high-resolution (5 arc sec, 13 kpc.) sample have no optical counterparts in the Digital Sky Survey. This suggests that DDGs might be commonplace after all, and we go on to re-examine the main arguments that have been used against them [...] We find that the QSOAL argument founders on the aforementioned clustering while deep CCD surveys have so far covered too small an area to set set strong constraints on Low Surface Brightness Galaxies (LSBGs).
