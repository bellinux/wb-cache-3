40|$|Currently, {{a growing}} {{quantity}} of the Artiﬁcial Intelligence tasks demand a high eﬃciency of the classiﬁcation systems (classiﬁers); making {{an error in}} the classiﬁcation of an object or event can cause serious problems. This is worrying when the classiﬁers confront tasks where the classes are not linearly separable, the classiﬁers eﬃciency diminishes considerably. One solution for decreasing this complication is the Rejection Option. In several circumstances it is advantageous to not have a decision be taken and wait to obtain additional information instead of making an error. This work contains the description of a novel <b>reject</b> <b>procedure</b> whose purpose is to identify elements with {{a high risk of}} being misclassiﬁed; like those in an overlap zone. For this, the location of the object in evaluation is calculated with regard to two hyperplanes that emulate the classiﬁers decision boundary. The area between these hyperplanes is named an overlap region. If the element is localized in this area, it is rejected. Experiments conducted with the artiﬁcial neural network Multilayer Perceptron, trained with the Backpropagation algorithm, show between 12. 0 %- 91. 4 %of the objects in question would have been misclassiﬁed if they had not been rejected...|$|E

40|$|Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is {{a method}} to obtain a {{posterior}} distribution without a likelihood function, using simulations {{and a set of}} distance metrics. For that reason, it has recently been gaining popularity as an analysis tool in cosmology and astrophysics. Its drawback, however, is a slow convergence rate. We propose a novel method, which we call qABC, to accelerate ABC with Quantile Regression. In this method, we create a model of quantiles of distance measure as a function of input parameters. This model is trained on a small number of simulations and estimates which regions of the prior space are likely to be accepted into the posterior. Other regions are then immediately <b>rejected.</b> This <b>procedure</b> is then repeated as more simulations are available. We apply it to the practical problem of estimation of redshift distribution of cosmological samples, using forward modelling developed in previous work. The qABC method converges to nearly same posterior as the basic ABC. It uses, however, only 20 % of the number of simulations compared to basic ABC, achieving a fivefold gain in execution time for our problem. For other problems the acceleration rate may vary; it depends on how close the prior is to the final posterior. We discuss possible improvements and extensions to this method.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} two major issues that {{surround}} testing for a unit root in practice, namely, (i) uncertainty {{as to whether or}} not a linear deterministic trend is present in the data and (ii) uncertainty as to whether the initial condition of the process is (asymptotically) negligible or not. In each case simple testing procedures are proposed with the aim of maintaining good power properties across such uncertainties. For the first issue, if the initial condition is negligible, quasi-differenced (QD) detrended (demeaned) Dickey–Fuller-type unit root tests are near asymptotically efficient when a deterministic trend is (is not) present in the data generating process. Consequently, we compare a variety of strategies that aim to select the detrended variant when a trend is present, and the demeaned variant otherwise. Based on asymptotic and finite-sample evidence, we recommend a simple union of rejections-based decision rule whereby the unit root null hypothesis is rejected whenever either of the detrended or demeaned unit root tests yields a rejection. Our results show that this approach generally outperforms more sophisticated strategies based on auxiliary methods of trend detection. For the second issue, we again recommend a union of rejections decision rule, rejecting the unit root null if either of the QD or ordinary least squares (OLS) detrended/demeaned Dickey–Fuller-type tests <b>rejects.</b> This <b>procedure</b> is also shown to perform well in practice, simultaneously exploiting the superior power of the QD (OLS) detrended/demeaned test for small (large) initial conditions. ...|$|R

One of the path times is chosen at random, the momenta p are modified slightly into p + δp, where δp is a random perturbation consistent with system constraints, e.g. conservation of energy and linear and angular momentum.

The necessary reference information is derived automatically from up-to-date digital remotely sensed images using automatic image analysis. The {{focus is on the}} quality assessment of roads as these are amongst the most frequently changing objects in the landscape. In contrast to existing approaches for quality control of road data, common and consistent statistical modelling and processing of the road data to be assessed and the objects extracted from the images are carried out. A geometric-topologic relationship model for the roads and their surroundings is defined. The surrounding objects (context objects, such as rows of trees) support the quality assessment of road vector data as they may explain gaps in road extraction. The extraction and explicit incorporation of those context objects in the assessment of a given road database gives stronger support for or against its correctness. During the assessment existing relations between road objects from the database and extracted objects are compared to the modelled relations. The certainty measures of the objects are integrated in this comparison. Normally more than one extracted object gives evidence for a road database object, therefore a reasoning algorithm which combines evidence given by the extracted objects is used. If the majority of the total evidence argues for the database object and if a certain amount of this database object is covered by extracted objects, the database object is assumed to be correct, i. e. it is accepted, otherwise it is rejected.
