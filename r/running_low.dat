5|$|At about 10:30, Rybka {{launched}} a frontal attack across the Unac supported {{by at least}} one MG42 machine gun firing into the mouth of the cave. The Germans reached the base of the hill, fifty metres from the cave, but suffered severe casualties in the assault. They were also <b>running</b> <b>low</b> on water. Prior to this attack, Tito and around 20 staff had taken refuge in the cave.|$|E

5|$|At {{approximately}} 7:40pm, the 727 {{took off}} with only Cooper, pilot Scott, flight attendant Mucklow, copilot Rataczak, and flight engineer H. E. Anderson aboard. Two F-106 fighter aircraft scrambled from nearby McChord Air Force Base followed behind the airliner, one above it and one below, out of Cooper's view. A Lockheed T-33 trainer, diverted from an unrelated Air National Guard mission, also shadowed the 727 before <b>running</b> <b>low</b> on fuel and turning back near the Oregon–California state line.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1923 Lethbridge {{was part}} of a second {{expedition}} led by Wordie, designed to explore the eastern coast of Greenland to conduct geological and archaeological investigations and repeat Edward Sabine's pendulum gravity experiments. Sailing from Newcastle, they stopped first at Bergen and then Jan Meyen before getting stuck in pack ice. With food reserves <b>running</b> <b>low,</b> the crew resorted to killing and eating grey seals and polar bears, before they eventually aborted the mission and returned home.|$|E
5|$|About 10:30, the Germans {{reached the}} {{defensive}} line near Torčec, and fighting began. The few remaining Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group mounted attacks on the bridge over the Drava at Gyékényes. After the Germans reinforced their bridgehead with two more battalions, they overcame the Yugoslav defenders, who had suffered significant losses and were <b>running</b> <b>low</b> on artillery ammunition. About 18:00, the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew to Koprivnica with its artillery support, and it remained in the town during the night. At 23:00, following orders from Petrović {{that he was to}} attack on 8 April at all costs, Nedeljković issued orders for a counterattack to be carried out early on 8 April.|$|E

5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and with fuel <b>running</b> <b>low</b> {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and {{would be forced to}} divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on September 5 the North Koreans attacked. The {{engineers}} repulsed {{this attack}} but suffered some casualties. Ammunition was <b>running</b> <b>low</b> and three US C-47 Skytrain aircraft {{came over the}} area to make an airdrop. The planes mistakenly dropped their bundles of ammunition and food on the North Korean positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes came over and attacked D Company, also in error. Soon after this aerial attack, North Korean troops attacked the positions.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Pasir Panjang, Bukit Chandu was {{the last}} bastion of the 1st and 2nd Battalion Malay Regiment who, {{together}} with the 2nd Loyals Regiment, defended the western and southern parts of Singapore from 8–14 February 1942. Despite <b>running</b> <b>low</b> on ammunition and food, the Malay Regiments put up strong resistance, inflicting a heavy toll on the Japanese invaders. Outnumbered, the defenders were finally overrun and massacred by reinforced Japanese forces. A Malay officer, Second Lieutenant Adnan Bin Saidi, was captured alive and tortured by the Japanese, before being executed. The story of his heroism became well known throughout Singapore.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} speed the {{dismantling}} of the third-class forts, the 22nd Army Corps issued General Order 89, which stated (in part) that the guns and ammunition removed from the dismantled forts should be kept in storage. Fort Corcoran was chosen as one of the storage locations and thus avoided the immediate demise of the other third-class fortifications. By the end of August 1865, however, with funds <b>running</b> <b>low,</b> and no further appropriations likely, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners. Fort Corcoran stored the cannon of the dismantled forts located south of the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{commander}} of the Japanese XVIII Army, Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi, ordered Katagiri to launch another counterattack. The supply situation was acute by this stage, with ammunition <b>running</b> <b>low</b> and troops being limited to one-third of their daily rations, nevertheless the counterattack was scheduled for 23/24 November. However, the Australian occupation of Pabu and the threat it posed to the Japanese supply route, forced the Japanese commander to bring his schedule forward, and to divert some of the effort away from the recapture of Finschhafen and upon the Australian forces advancing towards Sattelberg in the south.|$|E
5|$|Provisions {{were now}} <b>running</b> <b>low,</b> {{and with the}} rescue mission overdue, Maxwell began formulating a plan to capture {{sufficient}} proas {{to escape from the}} island. While the plan was being proposed a sail was spotted on the horizon, heading toward the island. The appearance of this vessel, coupled with a sudden attack spearheaded by Alceste's marines, caused the pirates to flee. The rescue ship was Ternate, a 16-gun brig belonging to the British East India Company's navy, the Bombay Marine, despatched by Lord Amherst on the day of his arrival in Batavia.|$|E

5|$|Roquebert's {{squadron}} sailed westwards towards Bourbon, initially {{planning to}} raid the eastern coast of island for food supplies, {{as his own}} were <b>running</b> <b>low.</b> Although the British garrison {{in the eastern part}} of the island was weak, the plan was thwarted by heavy surf on the landing beaches and Roquebert continued eastwards on half rations, reaching Tamatave in Madagascar on 19 May. The British garrison at Tamatave, 100 men of the 22nd Regiment of Foot, were afflicted with malaria and surrendered without contesting the town, where the French squadron gathered water and food supplies.|$|E
5|$|So loud was {{the cheering}} that {{followed}} this address that the proas fell silent, the Dayaks apparently unnerved. In the morning however the 20 canoes were still offshore and, with the anticipated rescue overdue and supplies <b>running</b> <b>low,</b> a desperate plan {{was made to}} use the ship's boats to board and capture enough Dayak vessels to enable the entire crew to reach Batavia. However, while these plans were being formed the British East India Company's (EIC) armed brig Ternate appeared on the southern horizon.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{elements}} of the division—the 3rd/10th Baluch Regiment—crossed the Marano River on the eastern border {{on the night of}} the 17th, with the 1st/9th Gurkha Rifles moving through them to attack Points 343 and 366 near Faetano. These small hills—just behind the river—were held by two battalions of the 993rd Grenadier Regiment. The first—Point 343—was taken at 05:00, but the force occupying Point 366 had to fall back after <b>running</b> <b>low</b> on ammunition. Rifleman Sher Bahadur Thapa was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for holding the crest of the hill single-handed for two hours, allowing two companies to withdraw in safety, before being killed whilst trying to rescue another wounded Gurkha.|$|E

5|$|The next day, June 25, Black Hawk's party {{encountered}} a militia battalion commanded by Major John Dement. In the Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove, Black Hawk's warriors drove the militiamen inside their fort and commenced a two-hour siege. After losing nine warriors and killing five militiamen, Black Hawk broke off the siege {{and returned to}} his main camp at Lake Koshkonong. This would prove to be Black Hawk's last military success in the war. With his band <b>running</b> <b>low</b> on food, he decided to take them back across the Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|To this end, the 22nd Army Corps issued General Order 89, which stated (in part) {{that the}} guns and {{ammunition}} removed from the dismantled forts {{should be kept in}} storage. Fort Greble was chosen as one of the storage locations. As a second-class fort, Fort Greble continued to receive regular maintenance and upkeep. By the end of August 1865, however, with funds <b>running</b> <b>low,</b> and no further appropriations likely, this work began to slack off. As the money ran out, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners.|$|E
5|$|While Boone recovered, Shawnees kept {{up their}} attacks outside Boonesborough, {{destroying}} the surrounding cattle and crops. With {{the food supply}} <b>running</b> <b>low,</b> the settlers needed salt to preserve what meat they had, so in January 1778, Boone led a party of 30 men to the salt springs on the Licking River. On February 7, 1778, when Boone was hunting meat for the expedition, he was surprised and captured by warriors led by Blackfish. Because Boone's party was greatly outnumbered, Boone returned {{the next day with}} Blackfish and persuaded his men to surrender rather than put up a fight.|$|E
