25|$|With its {{commercial}} themes, particularly the perceived cuteness {{of the character}} Gizmo, Gremlins {{became the center of}} considerable merchandising. Due to this, it became part of a <b>rising</b> <b>trend</b> in film, which had received a boost from Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Manufacturers including LJN produced versions of Gizmo as dolls or stuffed animals. (The latter of which became a popular high demand toy during the holiday season of 1984.) Both Gizmo and the gremlins were mass-produced as action figures, and Topps printed trading cards based upon the film. A product placement deal with fast food chain Hardee's also led to a series of five book-and-cassette/45 records adaptations of the film's story. Starting in the early 2000s, companies such as Jun Planning and the National Entertainment Collectibles Association produced all-new Gremlins toys and collectibles.|$|E
25|$|The Monsey Church grew rapidly, {{along with}} Rockland County itself, in the 1950s.

Beginning in the 1970s, however, the pace of growth of the county began to slow. Along with a <b>rising</b> <b>trend</b> in the cost of living, an increasing number of Orthodox and Hasidic Jews have settled in Monsey and the immediate area.

At the last glacial maximum some 20,000 years ago, the sea level was [...] below its present-day level. For at least the last 100 years, the sea level has been rising at an average rate of about [...] per year. Most of this rise can be attributed to an increase in the temperature of the sea and the resulting slight thermal expansion of the upper [...] of water. Additional contributions, as much as one quarter of the total, come from water sources on land, such as melting snow and glaciers and extraction of groundwater for irrigation and other agricultural and human needs. The <b>rising</b> <b>trend</b> from global warming is expected to continue until at least the end of the 21st century.|$|E
500|$|The {{document}} {{containing the}} Ordinances is dated 5 October, and contains forty-one articles. In the preamble, the Ordainers voiced their concern {{over what they}} perceived as the evil councilors of the king, the precariousness of the military situation abroad, and the danger of rebellion at home over the oppressive prises. The articles {{can be divided into}} different groups, the largest of which deals with limitations on the powers of the king and his officials, and the [...] substitution of these powers with baronial control. It was ordained that the king should appoint his officers only [...] "by the counsel and assent of the baronage, and that in parliament." [...] Furthermore, the king could no longer go to war without the consent of the baronage, nor could he make reforms of the coinage. Additionally, it was decided that parliament should be held at least once a year. Parallel to these decisions were reforms of the royal finances. The Ordinances banned what was seen as extortionate prises and customs, {{and at the same time}} declared that revenues were to be paid directly into the exchequer. This was a reaction to the <b>rising</b> <b>trend</b> of receiving revenues directly into the royal household; making all royal finances accountable to the exchequer allowed greater public scrutiny.|$|E

2500|$|The {{statistical}} {{indicator of}} estimating Human Development in each nation is Human Development Index (HDI). It {{is the combination}} of [...] "Life Expectancy Index", [...] "Education Index" [...] and [...] "Income Index". The Life expectancy index reveals the standard of health {{of the population in}} the country; education index reveals the educational standard and the literacy ratio of the population; and the income index reveals the standard of living of the population. If all these indices have the <b>rising</b> <b>trend</b> {{over a long period of}} time, it is reflected into <b>rising</b> <b>trend</b> in HDI. The Human Capital is developed by health, education and quality of Standard of living. Therefore, the components of HDI viz, Life Expectancy Index, Education Index and Income Index are directly related to Human Capital formation within the nation. HDI is indicator of positive correlation between human capital formation and economic development. If HDI increases, there is higher rate of human capital formation in response to higher standard of education and health. Similarly, if HDI increases, per capita income of the nation also increases. Implicitly, HDI reveals that higher the human capital formation due to good standard of health and education, higher is the per capita income of the nation. This process of human development is the strong foundation of a continuous process of economic development of the nation for a long period of time. This significance of the concept of Human capital in generating long-term economic development of the nation cannot be neglected. It is expected that the Macroeconomic policies of all the nations are focused towards promotion of human development and subsequently economic development.|$|E
