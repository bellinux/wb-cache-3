5|$|At the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the honours {{were removed}} from Kinneff Church and {{returned}} to the king. Ogilvie quarrelled with Marischal's mother over who would take credit for saving the honours, though he was eventually <b>rewarded</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> baronetcy.

5|$|After impressing in {{his first}} season at City, Barton was offered a new one-year {{contract}} at the club by manager Kevin Keegan, which he signed in April 2003. He featured in the first team more regularly during the 2003–04 season and, following a second Premiership goal, was <b>rewarded</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> call-up to the England U21 squad for their 2004 European Championship qualifiers against Macedonia and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Johnson {{started his}} career with Manchester United as a trainee in 1992, but a knee injury {{suffered}} {{at the start of}} the 1992–93 season kept him out for over a year. After making his comeback in November 1993, he scored 12 goals in 22 competitive appearances for the club's youth teams, and was <b>rewarded</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> professional contract in July 1994. In 1994–95, he was part of the Manchester United youth team that won the FA Youth Cup.|$|E
5|$|For {{services}} unknown, he was <b>rewarded</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> consulship {{early in}} Vespasian's reign in 71. This {{was a remarkable}} honour, not only because he held this office early under the new regime, {{but also because it}} was an ordinary consulship (instead of a less prestigious suffect consulship), making him one of the few non-Flavians to be honoured in this way under Vespasian. After 71 Nerva again disappears from historical record, presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under Vespasian (69–79) and his sons Titus (79–81) and Domitian (81–96).|$|E

He finished the season ranked within the top ten in the league for possessions (613), disposals per game (25.5), and handpasses (327). His total of 63free kicks earned during the season was also the highest recorded since the AFL began in 1990, breaking the previous record of 54 set by Luke Darcy five years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Stewart {{retired from}} the {{military}} in 1954 but, in a break with convention, he was not <b>rewarded</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> knighthood for his services. This was most likely due to his previous clashes with Holland. He was knighted four years later by the newly elected Labour Government. He retired to Northland and died {{in the small town}} of Kawakawa on 13 November 1972. He was survived by his wife Rita, who he had married in 1922, and the couple's two children. He is buried in the servicemen's section of Wellington's Karori Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} {{out in the}} Delhi junior system, Kartik moved through the age group ranks at Railways, was selected for the Indian Under-19 team. He made his first-class debut in 1996–97 {{and after a few}} productive seasons at domestic level, made his Test debut in early-2000 as Kumble's bowling partner. However, he ran into disciplinary problems and was expelled from the National Cricket Academy in the same year, while new national captain Sourav Ganguly was reluctant to entrust him with responsibility. Ganguly called for off spinner Harbhajan to be recalled in 2001, and was <b>rewarded</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> series-winning performance against Australia. This entrenched the off spinner in the team and left Kartik on the outer.|$|E

5|$|Albert Bouchard {{had been}} {{completely}} excluded from the retooling of the album for contractual reasons, but hoped to have his long work <b>rewarded</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> credit as co-producer, and to be paid accordingly. After the disbandment of Blue Öyster Cult, he contacted the other band members {{in an attempt to}} organize a 1987 reunion tour, with the original line-up, to promote Imaginos. His economic and membership requests were both rejected, due to resistances within the label and within the band, so he filed a lawsuit in 1989 against the management of Blue Öyster Cult and Columbia Records to receive payment for his work. The lawsuit was settled out of court, but his resentment towards Sandy Pearlman for what he felt was a theft of his work never eased, eliminating any chance of future collaborations for the completion of the Imaginos saga.|$|E
5|$|At Chuck and Sarah's {{rehearsal}} dinner, Morgan tells Alex that he {{will stop}} going on missions and simply become an analyst. Chuck's sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) is unable {{to make her own}} video montage, having previewed and rejected Lester's deeply disturbed first cut. However, Jeff offers his own flawless cut of the montage, being <b>rewarded</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> kiss from Ellie. During the video, Chuck gets a phone call from Vivian, who intends to make him suffer. Vivian activates the Norseman device on a target at the dinner, who Chuck initially fears is his mother. Suddenly, Sarah's nose starts to bleed and she collapses in Chuck's arms as he calls out for help.|$|E
5|$|Before {{entering}} a stage, the player {{begins in the}} Attraction Information Center, which acts as a hub world. Here, the player can choose a partner and a level to enter, and see which attractions they have already completed. Bonus levels are hidden throughout the zones and can also be triggered by finishing a zone with 20 or more rings. In the bonus levels, the player is free falling and can pick up power-ups as they proceed. Special stages can be entered if finishing a zone with 50 or more rings. In these, the player must collect blue spheres in a forward-scrolling platformer; players are <b>rewarded</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Chaos Ring upon completion. Collecting all Chaos Rings rewards the player with the best possible ending, in which Sonic and Tails make cameo appearances.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the end of}} 1993, Butcher's {{reign as}} manager {{came to an end}} after 45games in charge, and he was {{replaced}} by Mick Buxton. In a period which included six managers in ten years, Buxton was sacked in 1995. Sunderland's board turned to Peter Reid as temporary manager, in the hopes of keeping Sunderland clear of relegation. That objective was achieved within weeks, and Reid was <b>rewarded</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> permanent contract. Reid's first full season as Sunderland manager, 1995–96, was successful; the club won the Division One title and gained promotion to the Premier League {{for the first time since}} the League restructuring which had taken effect in 1992–93. In the 1996–97 season, despite beating Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea they were relegated.|$|E
5|$|Before the season, Toronto won the NBA Draft Lottery {{and were}} awarded the 1st overall {{pick in the}} 2006 NBA draft. To prepare for their draft choice, the Raptors traded Rafael Araújo for Kris Humphries and Robert Whaley, and traded Matt Bonner, Eric Williams and a second round pick for Rasho Nesterovič and cash considerations. The 1st overall pick was used to select Italian Andrea Bargnani, making him the first European drafted number one overall. Maurizio Gherardini was hired as the club's {{vice-president}} and assistant general manager, making him the first European elevated to an NBA executive job. Promising small forward Charlie Villanueva was traded for point guard T. J. Ford and cash considerations, while Chris Bosh was <b>rewarded</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> three-year extension.|$|E
5|$|Having {{struggled}} for appearances with Stoke since their promotion into the Premier League, Cresswell joined Championship club Sheffield United on a three-month loan on 29 September 2009 {{and made his}} debut {{the same day as}} a 76th-minute substitute against Ipswich Town in a 3–3 home draw.

In England he often served as a royal justice and witnessed documents, which showed his closeness to the king.

De Gray continued in royal service after his elevation to the episcopate, lending the King money and undertaking diplomatic missions on his behalf. In 1205 King John attempted to further reward de Gray with a translation to the archbishopric of Canterbury, but a disputed election process led to de Gray's selection being quashed by Pope Innocent III in 1206.|$|E
