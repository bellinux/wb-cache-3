40|$|ABSTRACT. Nowadays, {{pineapple}} {{leaf fibre}} (PALF) {{is getting more}} attention in research area since it’s showed the enhanced properties to be utilized in few industries. From the previous studies, it has been proved that, PALF is mechanically sound as a composites reinforcement agent and it’s showed the good contribution in pulp and papermaking production. Due to its enhanced properties, PALF now is commercialized as an alternative textile fiber. PALF is silky, fine and textile grade. Apart from being used as an alternative fiber for home textile and apparel, PALF meet the basic requirement {{to be used as}} technical fibers. Instead of having a good strength, PALF also have a reasonable length as well as can be pliable. All of these are the main principle of <b>rope</b> <b>making</b> fibers hence make PALF have huge potential to be used as <b>rope</b> <b>making</b> fibers. This paper will present the possibility of converting PALF into textile yarns and then into rope yarns for cordage and <b>rope</b> <b>making.</b> The methodology involved is included PALF extraction, PALF spinning, and PALF twisting. Finally, this paper will present the expected approached for the upcoming work area...|$|R
40|$|The current {{development}} of new potential fibers is widening the areas of application. One of the current potential fibers developed is pineapple leaf fiber (PALF). PALF {{have been widely used}} as a raw material for pulp and paper making industry in Malaysia recently. Due to its enhanced properties, PALF now is commercialized as an alternative textile fiber. PALF is one of the high textile grade fibers which are commonly extracted by decorticator machine. PALF is silky, fine and textile grade. Hence, it has been widely used to make apparel. Apart from being used as an alternative fiber for home textile and apparel, PALF meet the basic requirement to be used as technical fibers. This paper presented the possibility of PALF utilization as technical fibers in <b>rope</b> <b>making.</b> PALF have similarity properties with others natural rope fibers and its can be spun into rope yarn. Instead of having a good strength, PALF also have a reasonable length as well as can be pliable. All of these are the main principle of <b>rope</b> <b>making</b> fibers. As PALF have meet this entire requirement, {{it can be said that}} its have huge potential to be used as <b>rope</b> <b>making</b> fibers...|$|R
