5|$|In the 1950s, Hong Kong {{became the}} first of the Four Asian Tiger economies under rapid {{industrialisation}} driven by textile exports, manufacturing industries and <b>re-exports</b> of goods to China. As the population grew, with labour costs remaining low, living standards began to rise steadily. The construction of the Shek Kip Mei Estate in 1953 {{marked the beginning of the}} public housing estate programme to provide shelter for the less privileged and to cope with the influx of immigrants.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong is the world's {{eleventh}} largest trading entity, {{with the}} total value of imports and exports exceeding its gross domestic product. It is the world's largest re-export centre. Much of Hong Kong's exports consist of <b>re-exports,</b> which are products made outside of the territory, especially in mainland China, and distributed via Hong Kong. Its physical location has allowed the city to establish a transportation and logistics infrastructure that includes the world's second busiest container port and the world's busiest airport for international cargo. Even before the transfer of sovereignty, Hong Kong had established extensive trade and investment ties with the mainland, which now enable it to serve as a point of entry for investment flowing into the mainland. At the end of 2007, there were 3.46million people employed full-time, with the unemployment rate averaging 4.1% for the fourth straight year of decline. Hong Kong's economy is dominated by the service sector, which accounts for over 90% of its GDP, while industry constitutes 9%. Inflation was at 2.5% in 2007. Hong Kong's largest export markets are mainland China, the United States, and Japan.|$|E
25|$|From 1955 to 1962, {{the rate}} of growth was faster. The number of {{factories}} increased by 1.8 times, while the number of factory workers increased 2.6 times. However, the value of domestic exports decreased from 1958 to 1959. In 1959, for the first time, the value of <b>re-exports</b> exceeded that of exports. By 1962, the value of <b>re-exports</b> had shrunk again to a third of that of exports.|$|E
40|$|The present article {{deals with}} the {{research}} {{of the concept of}} ‘re-export of financial services’ in banking, the examples of its practical expression and influence on economic processes. For theoretical formulation of the ‘re-export of financial services’ concept the author uses the method of inductive evidence to compare the concepts of export and <b>re-export</b> of goods and services, as well as analyzes historical information on the given subject. Special attention is paid to the comparison of ‘re-export of financial services’ with ‘re-export of capital’. The above mentioned research resulted in the author’s derivation of <b>re-export</b> theory. As practical examples of <b>re-export</b> of financial services the author quotes current schemes used by Latvian banks in their work with fast money transfers and with financial instruments trading on global markets. The article is completed by a disclosure and survey of positive and negative aspects of the influence of <b>re-export,</b> including financial services, on both subjects of economics and economy as a whole. <b>re-export,</b> financial services, banking, export, capital <b>re-export...</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that between 1627 and 1807, approximately 387,000 enslaved Africans were sent to Barbados. Barbados (Bridgetown, in particular), <b>re-exported</b> many slaves to North America, other Caribbean islands, and the Captaincy General of Venezuela. Later, the Royal African Company established offices in Jamaica and Barbados. Thus, from Jamaica are <b>re-exported</b> slaves to Mexico, while from Barbados are <b>re-exported</b> to Venezuela. The slave trade ceased in 1807, and slaves were emancipated in 1834.|$|R
50|$|At {{the moment}} {{only a small}} {{proportion}} of gas imports are <b>re-exported</b> to the EU.

2500|$|In {{recent years}} oil has been {{imported}} from Kuwait {{and also from}} Bahrain.

2500|$|Of course, the English {{were not}} the only [...] "victims." [...] The French, Scandinavian, and North-German merchants were also hit hard by the sudden {{resurgence}} of the Dutch in world markets. But the English were especially hit hard. This caused tremendous resentment, also because the English were not inclined to seek the fault with themselves, but suspected the Dutch of conspiring to engross world trade with means that could not be other than foul. However, this may be, the Commonwealth felt they could not take this Dutch [...] "insolence" [...] lying down. Unfortunately, unlike the Scandinavians and the Hanseatics, they were in a military position to do something about it. The Commonwealth government first tried peaceful means, like a haughty attempt to renew the English protectorate from Elizabethan and Jacobean days (based on the Treaty of Nonsuch) over the Republic, but this was politely rejected. Then Parliament passed the Navigation Act, which was intended to break the hold of the Dutch entrepot by prohibiting its <b>re-exports</b> to English markets, and also reserving the carrying trade to and from England to English bottoms. Of course, these blatantly protectionist measures most of all hurt the English economy and that of the English colonies. After all, the Dutch did not hold a pistol to the heads of their customers, but had achieved their ascendancy by offering better deals. English importers and consumers were now deprived of these benefits.|$|E
50|$|When {{dealing with}} trade data, it is {{essential}} to subtract <b>re-exports</b> from normal exports to arrive at the final value of exports. This is necessary because <b>re-exports</b> do not undergo any value-added processes, so cannot be counted towards a nation's exports.|$|E

40|$|With falling tariff and {{non-tariff}} barriers, lowering other {{trade costs}} related to the logistics of moving goods through ports is key to further facilitation of world trade. Such costs {{are now part of}} the language of several GATT articles of importance to WTO negotiations. This paper estimates the effect of various port costs on <b>re-export</b> intensity in six major Asian ports: Dubai, Manama, Mumbai, Bandar Abbas, Damman, and Hong Kong. What we find is that the cost of transportation and logistics is the most important factor affecting <b>re-export</b> intensity. We also find that <b>re-export</b> intensity is not dissimilar between the Asian ports reviewed except Hong Kong. Hong Kong seems to outperform the rest of the ports except Dubai.

5000|$|Re-exportation, {{also called}} {{entrepot}} trade, may occur when {{one member of}} {{a free trade agreement}} charges lower tariffs to external nations to win trade, and then <b>re-exports</b> the same product to another partner in the trade agreement, but tariff-free.

25|$|Cassiterite {{production}} {{peaked at}} 1,000 tonnes in 1990, but was under 700 tonnes in 2000.

At {{least part of}} the increase in production is because of new mines opening up in Rwanda. However it is true, as has frequently been observed, that the increase is also because of the fraudulent <b>re-export</b> of Congolese coltan. In addition to the well-publicised involvement in this trade of the Rwandan Defence Force (RDF), another important factor in the coltan <b>re-export</b> is that international dealers are under pressure not to buy from the DRC, thus increasing the incentive for DRC coltan to be <b>re-exported</b> as Rwanda's. Rwanda is also alleged to be trading in fraudulently exported gold and diamonds from the DRC.|$|R
