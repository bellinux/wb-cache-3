And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell you another thing you all need to think about, that even surprised me, is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.|$|E

It's been interesting for me, since the events of September 11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and {{talking to me about}} 'Never Too Far,' 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured {{that it would be a}} nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. ...

500|$|Adrien Begrand's {{review in}} PopMatters found that Rounds is [...] "a {{remarkable}} record" [...] and that [...] "sublime, computer-crafted recordings like Rounds provides in spades {{are making the}} most exciting sounds <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> 2003." [...] In Spin, Will Hermes described the album as a [...] "varied trip" [...] and noted [...] "a darker vibe suggesting the influence of Hebden's labelmate Dan Snaith of Manitoba." [...] Stylus Magazine writer Nick Southall recognised Hebden's [...] "perpetual evolution and motion," [...] declaring that [...] "this is simply a great record of beautiful music." [...] Robert Christgau's review of Rounds for the Village Voice argued that Hebden [...] "imagines an aural space in which electronic malfunction is cute rather than annoying or ominous," [...] using [...] "the computer as music box." [...] Tom Ridge of The Wire stated that [...] "nothing here sounds like an exercise in genre plundering," [...] and that [...] "Hebden has devised a musical identity that is distinctly different from his work with Fridge, but both projects share a passion for defying boundaries." ...|$|E
500|$|In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau hailed Off the Wall as [...] "the dance groove of the year" [...] {{and that}} Jackson's vocal stylings were a {{reminder}} that he had grown up. In a review for Melody Maker Phil McNeill expressed the opinion that in Off the Wall Jackson sounded comfortable, confident and in control. He believed [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" [...] had a [...] "classy" [...] introduction {{and that it was}} the best song on the album. He also praised [...] "Rock with You", describing it as [...] "masterful". The reviewer concurred with a colleague that Jackson was [...] "probably the best singer in the world <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> terms of style and technique". Giving the album a favorable review in Smash Hits, David Hepworth said that Jackson [...] "sings like an angel". Sounds shared the same point of view, qualifying Jackson's voice as [...] "astoninshingly agile". The first side of Off the Wall is praised for its [...] "clutch of dancers that must have even Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards watching their backs".|$|E

They wrote: [...] "Anyone {{from the age of}} 5 to 95 can walk out of a Bruno Mars concert feeling like the show was designed just for them. Mars walks the old-school walk and talks the sexy talk, but he also nails the hits, leads a super-energetic nine-piece soul band, and rips a mean drum solo", praising the [...] "spectacular version" [...] of [...] "Gorilla". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard described Mars' performance as [...] "entertaining ... keeping smiles plastered on the faces of his onlookers, and he does a better job at it than almost anyone working in music right now". NFL executives Sarah Moll and Tracy Perlman stated that: [...] "If you go to his concerts, it's 11-year-old girls to 65-year-old women—it's everyone", after seeing The Moonshine Jungle tour several times during the summer of 2013.|$|E

And I don't really believe those polls. I travel around the country, I see people, I see their response to my husband, I see their response to me. There {{are a lot of}} difficult challenges <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the United States... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them... When his polls were really high they weren't on the front page." ...|$|E
500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the recording room and told Powell [...] "You have to go out there, and you and her do this because you're coming to God <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> front of my eyes. You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E

By the next month she started posting a number of images on social media website Instagram, where she hinted at possible songwriters and collaborators with hashtag captions. Two months later, Madonna posted a selfie where she talked about working with American DJ Diplo. Madonna had invited him to her annual Oscar party, but he was unable to attend. They eventually started talking about music through texts and decided to collaborate on the album. In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his [...] "craziest record" [...] for the album. Together they wrote and recorded seven songs and Diplo added that [...] " [...] was up for anything. I love when an artist gives a producer the confidence he needs to work with them, and [...] was very open-minded to my ideas. Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding.

500|$|By December 2013, Madonna's manager Guy Oseary {{commented that}} the singer was [...] "eager to get started" [...] on her next album. However, she had another project in mind – {{developing}} the screenplay for the Andrew Sean Greer novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Madonna decided to split her time between writing the screenplay and writing songs for the new album. In February 2014, Madonna confirmed that she had already begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying: [...] "I'm <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I {{want to go with}} my music". Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed {{that a lot of the}} people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs. [...] "So, I was just the person standing there with a clipboard in the headlights, going 'Ok!' A little bit like a school teacher," [...] she admitted.|$|E
500|$|Brian Lowry of Variety {{positively}} {{wrote that}} the finale [...] "ignored" [...] the last few seasons' missteps and was [...] "awash in warmth and inside gags". He concluded that the show [...] "deserved to finish on top", and that {{while some of the}} scenes, such as Dwight's wedding seemed [...] "a little bit trite", the resulting product was successful. Michael Tedder of Vulture awarded the episode five stars out of five and {{wrote that the}} episode was able to provide solid conclusions for all of the characters. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and wrote that [...] "the quality of this series finale is found in the way it functions <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>in</b> the afterglow of a TV show to which many devoted more than 100 hours of their lives. Some aspects of the episode fall flat, but when it hits, it hits." [...] Ultimately, he found that Finale' is not a great piece of television" [...] but that it was the finale that [...] "The Office needed" [...] because it was [...] "the right point to jump off ... the circular track", due to the series idea of thematic reoccurrence. Tom Gliatto of People magazine, however, gave the episode a negative review, and wrote that [...] "this episode was poorly conceived and clumsily structured. It really wasn't worthy of all the years of affectionate humor that had gone before it." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Billboard, In the Zone marks {{a musical}} {{departure}} for Spears. Instead of traditional pop, {{the album is}} darker and more dance-oriented. Spears talked about the overall sound of the album with Rolling Stone, saying, [...] "I'd describe it as trance-y, kind of vibe record—something you could listen to that's no so song-structured [...] Of course I'm not doing '...Baby One More Time' and those massive hits anymore. I think this record is where I am at <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> my life. It's sensual, it's sexual. I'm probably writing about that subconsciously because I don't have that right now." [...] Amy Schriefer of NPR stated the album {{is a mix of}} dance, house, crunk, Diwali beats, reggae and hip hop. According to William Shaw of Blender, the main theme of In the Zone is [...] "Spears’s awakening to her sexuality as a single woman." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "Me Against the Music", [...] features Madonna, but was constructed as a duet after she was added to the track. Spears and Madonna trade lines during the verses, and Madonna sings solo in the bridge. The instrumentation in the song includes influences of hip hop and funk guitars. The song's lyrics feature Spears and Madonna singing of the pleasures of letting go on the dancefloor, in [...] "I'm up against the speaker / Trying to take on the music / It's like a competition". The second song, [...] "I Got That (Boom Boom)", is an Atlanta-style hip hop track featuring the Ying Yang Twins.|$|E
