There are no outward signs of the subclinical phase. Clinical signs of the chronic phase include weight loss, pale gums due to anemia, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, dyspnea, coughing, polyuria, polydipsia, lameness, ophthalmic diseases such as <b>retinal</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> and anterior uveitis, and neurological disease.

Signs and symptoms of hypertensive encephalopathy may include severe headache, nausea and vomiting (often of a projectile nature), focal neurologic signs, and alterations in mental status. Untreated, hypertensive encephalopathy may progress to stupor, coma, seizures, and death within hours. For example, signs of retinopathy that reflect the exudative stage, such as <b>retinal</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> or microaneurysm, may be seen in eyes that do not have features of the sclerotic stage, The exudative signs are nonspecific, since they are seen in diabetes and other conditions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Retinal</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> is a {{disorder}} {{of the eye}} in which bleeding occurs into the light sensitive tissue on the back wall of the eye. A <b>retinal</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> can be caused by hypertension, retinal vein occlusion (a blockage of a retinal vein), or diabetes mellitus (which causes small fragile blood vessels to form, which are easily damaged).

40|$|Child abuse {{occurs in}} 1 % of {{children}} in the United States every year; 10 % of the traumatic injuries suffered by children under 5 years old are nonaccidental, and 5 % to 20 % of these nonaccidental injuries are lethal. Rapid characterization of the injury as nonaccidental is of considerable benefit to child protection workers and police investigators seeking to safeguard the child care environment and apprehend and prosecute those who have committed the crime of child abuse. Physically abused children present with a variety of well-described injuries that are usually easily identifiable. In some cases, however, particularly those involving children with the shaken baby syndrome, obvious signs of physical injury may not exist. Although external signs of such an injury are infrequent, the rapid acceleration-deceleration forces involved often cause subdural hematomas and <b>retinal</b> <b>hemorrhages,</b> hallmarks of the syndrome. Frequently, <b>retinal</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> may be the only presenting sign that child abuse has occurred. Complicating the interpretation of the finding of <b>retinal</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> is the belief by some physicians that <b>retinal</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> {{may be the result of}} chest compressions given during resuscitative efforts.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Retinal</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> {{have been}} {{described}} as a component of high altitude retinopathy (HAR) in association with altitude illness. In this prospective high altitude study, we aimed to gain new insights into the pathophysiology of HAR and explored whether HAR could be a valid early indicator of altitude illness. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 28 mountaineers were randomly assigned to two ascent profiles during a research expedition to Mt. Muztagh Ata (7546 m/ 24, 751 ft). Digital fundus photographs were taken prior to expedition at 490 m (1, 607 ft), during expedition at 4497 m (14, 750 ft = base camp), 5533 m (18, 148 ft), 6265 m (20, 549 ft), 6865 m (22, 517 ft) and 4. 5 months thereafter at 490 m. Number, size and time of occurrence of hemorrhages were recorded. Oxygen saturation (SpO₂) and hematocrit were also assessed. 79 % of all climbers exhibited <b>retinal</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> during the expedition. Number and area of retinal bleeding increased moderately to medium altitudes (6265 m). Most <b>retinal</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> were detected after return to base camp from a high altitude. No post-expeditional ophthalmic sequelae were detected. Significant negative (SpO₂ Beta: - 0. 4, p< 0. 001) and positive (hematocrit Beta: 0. 2, p =  0. 002, time at altitude Beta: 0. 33, p =  0. 003) correlations with hemorrhages were found. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: When closely examined, a very large amount of climbers exhibit <b>retinal</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> during exposure to high altitudes. The incidence of <b>retinal</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> may be greater than previously appreciated as a definite time lag was observed between highest altitude reached and development of <b>retinal</b> bleeding. <b>Retinal</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> should not be considered warning signs of impending severe altitude illness due to their delayed appearance...|$|R
