50|$|The {{company has}} its {{origin in the}} {{telecommunications}} industry and was founded in 1987 by Uwe Böttcher, {{the former head of}} Fusion Splicing Development and Production at LM Ericsson Fiber Optics in Stockholm. Nyfors first commercial product was an optical fiber <b>recoater</b> launched in 1988.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} major {{projects}} in which Nyfors participated was the submarine optical fiber cable between the Swedish mainland and Gotland in the Baltic Sea. The project {{was carried out in}} close collaboration between Alcatel and the public telephone company Televerket, with Nyfors providing the on-board optical fiber recoaters. Partly {{as a result of the}} technological development carried out during this project, the company was able to launch its first commercial optical fiber <b>recoater</b> in 1988.|$|E
5000|$|Recoating is {{the process}} of {{restoring}} the primary coating to stripped optical fiber sections after fusion splicing. In the recoating process, the spliced fiber is restored to its original shape and strength, using a <b>recoater.</b> The stripped fiber section is recoated by filling a recoating resin, usually acrylate into transparent moulds. The resin is then cured with UV light. It is often desirable to perform a proof-test after recoating, to ensure that the splice is strong enough to survive handling, packaging and extended use.|$|E
50|$|The first {{commercial}} optical fiber <b>recoaters</b> {{were developed by}} the Swedish firms Nyfors Teknologi AB and LM Ericsson in the late 1980s for the telecommunications industry.|$|R
50|$|Optical fiber {{recoating}} is {{the process}} of restoring the primary coating to stripped optical fiber sections after fusion splicing. The polymer comprising the recoat is usually similar in composition to the original fiber polymer coating. Nyfors optical fiber <b>recoaters</b> are designed to restore the primary coating on spliced optical fibers with acrylate coatings. Due to the mould design, the restored part of the coating has a diameter and other properties, such as eccentricity and roundness, that are almost identical to the original fiber.|$|R
40|$|A {{distributed}} {{chemical sensor}} is developed by coating multiple Bragg gratings {{in a single}} glass fiber with chemical responsive coatings. The composition of the coating is tuned to the target chemicals to be measured and the optical response of the coated grating is optimized by changing the coating thickness. Specific <b>recoaters</b> were used to apply the responsive coatings reproducibly onto the glass fibers. The coating compositions can be based on UV curing or solvent based systems. In this paper we show the development and application of a distributed gas sensor for CO 2, H 2 S and H 2 O {{that can be used}} for down-hole monitoring in the oil and gas industry. We have developed a toolbox for the design and modeling of the responsive polymer coatings, and the performance of the actual sensors corresponded well with the predicted behavior. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
5000|$|The DMLS {{process begins}} with a 3D CAD model whereby a [...]stl file is created {{and sent to the}} machine’s {{computer}} program. A technician works with this 3D model to properly orient the geometry for part building and adds supports structure as appropriate. Once this [...] "build file" [...] has been completed, it is [...] "sliced" [...] into the layer thickness the machine will build in and downloaded to the DMLS machine allowing the build to begin. The DMLS machine uses a high-powered 200 watt Yb-fiber optic laser. Inside the build chamber area, there is a material dispensing platform and a build platform along with a <b>recoater</b> blade used to move new powder over the build platform. The technology fuses metal powder into a solid part by melting it locally using the focused laser beam. Parts are built up additively layer by layer, typically using layers 20 micrometers thick.|$|E
40|$|Before utilising {{selective}} laser melting in real applications, the process {{as well as the}} outcome component and its characteristics need to be fully understood. Based on the layer-wise fabrication, with its distinctive orientations in translations and thermal influences within this additive manufacturing process, the obtained material properties and the microstructure are anticipated to be anisotropic. The {{selective laser}} melting process involves: the laser movement pattern in plane and rotation between single layers; <b>recoater</b> movement; substrate plate heating and movement; laser irradiation from the top; and inert gas flow. In order to gain insight into the process and its related characteristics, different sets of prismatic specimens in terms of orientation and inclination were produced and evaluated. The evaluation contained surface quality investigations with two independent measurement approaches, i. e. tactile and optical, density measurements based on the Archimedes principle and micro-section evaluation. Furthermore, ultrasonic analyses were conducted to study the feasibility of determining the mechanical properties, i. e. Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, in accordance with the recorded longitudinal and transversal sonic velocities. The chosen raw material for these investigations was AlSi 10 Mg and the fabricated parts exhibited a high relative density of at least 99. 5 %. Remarkable deviations were evident in the obtained surface quality and clear trends could be determined based on the inclination and orientation condition of the sample during manufacturing. In regards to the ultrasonic investigation, {{it was found that the}} reported inherent anisotropy of selective laser melted samples could not be detected with the non-destructive ultrasonic investigation, and destructive procedures, to date, represent the only reliable method to accurately reveal the material characteristics.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Fiber Bragg grating sensors {{have been}} {{constantly}} researched {{for the last}} ten years and have finally begun to find use in the commercial market. However, one of the major factors limiting their widespread use is their system cost. Their lightweight, flexibility, electromagnetic immunity, and small size make fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors feasible in hostile environments where electrical and mechanical sensors may not function effectively. These sensor systems utilize moderately expensive light sources and detectors at telecommunication wavelengths of 1300 nm and 1550 nm. These are the center wavelengths of the mass-produced FBGs and FBG phase masks. This thesis addresses the development of a lower cost short wavelength fiber Bragg grating strain sensor system using gratings written at 790 nm and 850 nm with the modified phase mask method recently developed at Oregon State University. Short wavelength gratings allow the use of less expensive semiconductor sources and silicon detectors, greatly reducing the overall cost of a strain sensor system from approximately 1600 for a 1300 nm system to 1000 for a 790 nm system. First, the fundamental properties and historical background of fiber Bragg gratings were reviewed. Followed by a literature review of the structures, fabrication methods, and applications of FBGs including sensor applications. The design, manufacture, and assembly of the new short wavelength strain sensor system were described including the production of pigtailed super-luminescent edge emitting light emitting diodes (SELED) from commercial laser diodes, a fiber <b>recoater,</b> and multiple attempts to write a fiber Bragg grating in the 750 - 850 nm wavelength region. Finally, the short wavelength strain sensor system was compared with a 1300 nm strain sensor detailing the potential cost savings with the short wavelength system...|$|E
