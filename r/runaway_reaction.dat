5|$|However if {{the white}} dwarf merges with another white dwarf (a very rare event), it will {{momentarily}} exceed the limit and begin to collapse, again raising its temperature past the nuclear fusion ignition point. Within {{a few seconds of}} initiation of nuclear fusion, a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes a <b>runaway</b> <b>reaction,</b> releasing enough energy (1–) to unbind the star in a supernova explosion.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a <b>runaway</b> <b>reaction.</b> If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E
5|$|On {{the surface}} of the white dwarf, the accreted gas will become {{compressed}} and heated. At some point the accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing a <b>runaway</b> <b>reaction</b> that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface. This would result in a (recurrent) nova explosion—a cataclysmic variable star—and the luminosity of the white dwarf rapidly would increase by several magnitudes for a period of several days or months. An example of such a star system is RS Ophiuchi, a binary system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf companion. RS Ophiuchi has flared into a (recurrent) nova on at least six occasions, each time accreting the critical mass of hydrogen needed to produce a runaway explosion.|$|E

5|$|The risk of {{building}} an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area {{was a significant}} issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic nuclear meltdown blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even {{in the event of}} a <b>runaway</b> <b>reaction.</b> When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction. The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind fission products that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total neutron flux.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip. The plant officials then order the usage of the remaining methyl isocyanate as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Dilip is busy with the wedding of his sister, and Roy has a final look of the control room. The safety measures fail and a <b>runaway</b> <b>reaction</b> follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking, and an attempt to contain the leak fails. The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind. Motwani rushes to alert {{the people in the}} vicinity of the plant to vacate and head west, since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged. He meets Dilip, who ignores the warning and asks Motwani to leave the area without causing any hindrance to the wedding. Meanwhile, the guests experience irritation in the eyes and discomfort in breathing. Dilip senses the danger and visits the plant, realising that the plant had been compromised. He rushes back to his residence where he finds his family and relatives dying from acute exposure to the toxic gas. He carries away his son, paying farewell to his wife's corpse and flees the slum.|$|E
25|$|If a {{white dwarf}} forms a close binary system with another star, {{hydrogen}} {{from the larger}} companion may accrete around and onto a white dwarf until it gets hot enough to fuse in a <b>runaway</b> <b>reaction</b> at its surface, although the white dwarf remains below the Chandrasekhar limit.

40|$|In {{chemical}} processes, <b>runaway</b> <b>reactions,</b> i. e. exothermic reactions {{getting out}} of control, represent a potential hazard source. These processes may occur not only during chemical processing but also during storage and transportation. Quite often <b>runaway</b> <b>reactions</b> {{play an important role}} in the chain of a developing incident therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate their characteristic features in order to develop early detection and process control systems for anticipating uncontrolled runaway excursions in process plants. Such thermal runaways may be caused by an exothermic decomposition or by runaway of a desired exothermic reaction. In the case of <b>runaway</b> chemical <b>reactions</b> a thermal explosion is preceded by a self-heating process In a polymerization system the self-heating process is strongly influenced by self-acceleration behaviour due to the gel effect. The prime cause of these events is overheating which can lead to hazardous situations. The very high exothermicity of the process connected with a strong acceleration in rate versus conversioni makes the temperature control of the reactor very critical. A research programme on <b>runaway</b> <b>reactions</b> must lead to the identification of chemical, physical chemical and technological characteristics of the system under consideration in order to estimate the system safety and determine the criteria concerning the design and the control of the reactors and their protection systems. Modelling of the process and experimental tests are two efficient tools to investigate an area in which knowledge is still lacking. In this paper the suspension polymerisation of Methylmethacrylate has been studied...|$|R
25|$|Investigations {{demonstrated}} {{both were}} caused by the same underlying mechanism. When the pinch current was applied, any area of the gas that had a slightly higher density would create a slightly stronger magnetic field and collapse faster than the surrounding gas. This caused the localised area to have higher density, which created an even stronger pinch, and a <b>runaway</b> <b>reaction</b> would follow. The quick collapse in a single area would cause the whole column to break up.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen fusion {{may occur}} in a stable manner {{on the surface of}} the white dwarf for a narrow range of {{accretion}} rates, giving rise to a super soft X-ray source, but for most binary system parameters, the hydrogen burning is unstable thermally and rapidly converts a large amount of the hydrogen into other, heavier chemical elements in a <b>runaway</b> <b>reaction,</b> liberating an enormous amount of energy. This blows the remaining gases away from the surface of the white dwarf surface and produces an extremely bright outburst of light.|$|E

40|$|X-ray bursts (XRBs) {{have been}} thought to occur via {{thermonuclear}} <b>runaway</b> <b>reactions</b> {{on the surface}} of a neutron star. The <b>runaway</b> <b>reactions</b> are affected by both the properties of the accreted material, such as the accretion rate and the composition, and the reaction rates of participating nuclei. We investigate how the shape of the XRB light curve changes with specific reaction rates. As a case study, we choose three reaction rates, triple alpha, 18 Ne(α; ρ) 21 Na, and 15 O(α; γ) 19 Ne. We find that the shape of the light curve does change with different reaction rates for the same reaction, but the predicted light curves with 54 isotopes do not match the observed ones even when the variations within the different reaction rates are considered. We confirm that the shape of the light curve is more sensitive to the number of isotopes that participate in the runaway reactionsclos...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report {{is to provide a}} topical {{reference}} on the phenomena and prediction of uranium pyrophoricity for the Hanford Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Project with specific applications to SNF Project processes and situations. Spent metallic uranium nuclear fuel is currently stored underwater at the K basins in the Hanford 100 area, and planned processing steps include: (1) At the basins, cleaning and placing fuel elements and scrap into stainless steel multi-canister overpacks (MCOs) holding about 6 MT of fuel apiece; (2) At nearby cold vacuum drying (CVD) stations, draining, vacuum drying, and mechanically sealing the MCOs; (3) Shipping the MCOs to the Canister Storage Building (CSB) on the 200 Area plateau; and (4) Welding shut and placing the MCOs for interim (40 year) dry storage in closed CSB storage tubes cooled by natural air circulation through the surrounding vault. Damaged fuel elements have exposed and corroded fuel surfaces, which can exothermically react with water vapor and oxygen during normal process steps and in off-normal situations, A key process safety concern is the rate of reaction of damaged fuel and the potential for self-sustaining or <b>runaway</b> <b>reactions,</b> also known as uranium fires or fuel ignition. Uranium metal and one of its corrosion products, uranium hydride, are potentially pyrophoric materials. Dangers of pyrophoricity of uranium and its hydride have long been known in the U. S. Department of Energy (Atomic Energy Commission/DOE) complex and will be discussed more below; it is sufficient here to note that there are numerous documented instances of uranium fires during normal operations. The motivation for this work is to place the safety of the present process in proper perspective given past operational experience. Steps in development of such a perspective are: (1) Description of underlying physical causes for <b>runaway</b> <b>reactions,</b> (2) Modeling physical processes to explain <b>runaway</b> <b>reactions,</b> (3) Validation of the method against experimental data, (4) Application of the method to plausibly explain operational experience, and (5) Application of the method to present process steps to demonstrate process safety and margin. Essentially, the logic above is used to demonstrate that <b>runaway</b> <b>reactions</b> cannot occur during normal SNF Project process steps, and to illustrate the depth of the technical basis for such a conclusion. Some off-normal conditions are identified here that could potentially lead to <b>runaway</b> <b>reactions.</b> However, this document is not intended to provide an exhaustive analysis of such cases. In summary, this report provides a ''toolkit'' of models and approaches for analysis of pyrophoricity safety issues at Hanford, and the technical basis for the recommended approaches.

Many of the items in the 1982 report were temporarily fixed, but by 1984, conditions had again deteriorated.
