5000|$|During {{the days}} of the Family Computer, Nintendo {{developed}} the Disk System, a disk drive expansion for the Famicom with expanded RAM which allows players to use <b>rewritable</b> <b>disk</b> media called [...] "disk cards". The system was relatively popular, but suffered from issues of limited capacity. However, Nintendo did see the market for an economical rewritable medium due to the popularity of the Disk System. The Nintendo Power cartridges address the issue of potential copyright infringement {{by the fact that they}} are highly proprietary and more difficult for illicit duplication, as opposed to being a somewhat more commoditized medium like the floppy disk. The limited capacity issue was addressed by maximizing the size of the flash memory in the cartridge to 4 megabytes (32 megabits), the largest amount used by the vast majority of Super Famicom games.|$|E

However, suitable phase change {{materials are}} limited by nature due to the constraints of their contradictory properties.

In this work, the application of SLL phase change structures on data storage, e. g. optical <b>rewritable</b> <b>disk</b> and PCRAM are introduced. The SLL optical disc possesses a better recording property compared to conventional disc. The effect of the anisotropic thermal conductivity of SLL phase change layers on the thermal profile of PCRAM devices with conventional structure and line-type structure is investigated by simulation.

The Legend of Zelda was joined by a re-release of Super Mario Bros., Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Soccer, and Mahjong in its introduction of the Disk System. It made full use of the Disk Card media's advantages over traditional ROM cartridges with a disk size of 128 kilobytes, which was expensive to produce on cartridge format. Due to the still-limited amount of space on the disk, however, all the text was only in katakana. Rather than passwords, it used <b>rewritable</b> <b>disks</b> to save the game. It used the extra sound channel provided by the Disk System for certain sound effects; most notable are the sounds of Link's sword when his health is full, the roars and growls of dungeon bosses, and enemy death sounds. The sound effects used the Famicom's PCM channel in the cartridge version. It also used the microphone built into the Famicom's controller that {{was not included in}} the NES. This led to confusion in the U.S. as the instruction manual reads that Pols Voice, a rabbit-like enemy in the game, [...] "hates loud noise". Blowing or shouting into the Famicom's microphone kills these creatures. However, they cannot be killed through use of the recorder, and on the NES must be killed with weapons. The cartridge version made use of the Memory Management Controller chip, specifically the MMC1 model. The MMC could use bank-switching, allowing larger games than had been previously possible. They also allowed for battery-powered RAM, which let players save progress for the first time on any cartridge-based system or game.|$|R

40|$|Today's {{telecommunications}} networks are still largely optically opaque - consisting of electronic nodes connected by point-to-point optical links, {{relying on a}} series of optical-electrical conversions. Moving to all-optical switching will allow increased bit rates and low latency movement of data, providing greater routing agility, reducing energy requirements and simplifying network structures. This promise, and indeed the fact that the fundamental capacity limits of existing infrastructure are being reached, has sparked renewed interest in the extension of telecommunications bands to longer infrared wavelengths (where lower intrinsic losses in fibre media are possible) and intense efforts to develop techniques based on space-division multiplexing (in which many distinguishable data paths are established through the same fibre strand using either multiple cores or a multimode core) to substantially increase capacity. Future network architectures will require a new generation of highly integrated devices capable of functions such as all-optical switching and mode (de) multiplexing.

40|$|International audienceTelluride glasses, i. e., nonoxide glasses {{based on}} the chalcogen element tellurium, {{constitute}} a particular class of materials used in numerous technological applications. While many telluride systems are not intrinsically good glass formers, {{a wide range of}} telluride glass compositions have been developed and offer a unique set of optical and electrical properties. Telluride glasses possess a very broad transparency in the infrared, which can range up to more than 20  μm, making them particularly interesting for optical applications in the far-infrared range. Several families of telluride glasses (e. g., ternary and quaternary systems based on tellurium, germanium, and gallium) have been explored and optimized in order to further develop these applications. Indeed, a large number of organic compounds have their specific spectral signature (or “fingerprint”) in the far-infrared, making telluride glasses materials of choice for the fabrication of sensing devices. Tellurides are also found in the fabrication of <b>rewritable</b> optical <b>disks</b> and phase-change memory devices, as some compositions exhibit fast and reversible conversion between crystalline and amorphous (glassy) phases. More recently, telluride glasses have been demonstrated to be promising candidates as thermoelectric materials, due to their semiconducting nature. In this chapter, the fundamentals of the telluride glasses and of their structure are presented. An overview of the different families of telluride glasses, as well as their specific properties, is given.

40|$|A <b>rewritable</b> phase-change optical <b>disk</b> with 100 GB {{capacity}} on 120 mm {{was first}} demonstrated basically based on Blu-ray Disc format.

For enabling the triple-layer structure, a very thin phase-change film around 6 nm was adopted to achieve a large transmittance of more than 50 %.

40|$|An {{international}} standard has emerged {{for the first}} true multimedia format. Digital Versatile Disk (by its official name), you may know it as Digital Video Disks. DVD has applications in movies, music, games, information CD-ROMS, and many other areas where massive amounts of digital information is needed. Did I say massive amounts of data? Would you believe over 17 gigabytes on {{a single piece of}} plastic the size of an audio-CD? That`s the promise, at least, by the group of nine electronics manufacturers who have agreed to the format specification, and who hope to make this goal a reality by 1998. In this major agreement, which didn`t come easily, the manufacturers will combine Sony and Phillip`s one side double-layer NMCD format with Toshiba and Matsushita`s double sided Super-Density disk. By Spring of this year, they plan to market the first 4. 7 gigabyte units. The question is: Will DVD take off? Some believe that read-only disks recorded with movies will be about as popular as video laser disks. They say that until the eraseable/writable DVD arrives, the consumer will most likely not buy it. Also, DVD has a good market for replacement of CD- Roms. Back in the early 80 `s, the international committee deciding the format of the audio compact disk decided its length would be 73 minutes. This, they declared, would allow Beethoven`s 9 th Symphony to be contained entirely on a single CD. Similarly, today it was agreed that playback length of a single sided, single layer DVD would be 133 minutes, long enough to hold 94 % of all feature-length movies. Further, audio can be in Dolby`s AC- 3 stereo or 5. 1 tracks of surround sound, better than CD-quality audio (16 -bits at 48 kHz). In addition, there are three to five language tracks, copy protection and parental ``locks`` for R rated movies. DVD will be backwards compatible with current CD-ROM and audio CD formats. Added versatility comes by way of multiple aspect rations: 4 : 3 pan-scan, 4 : 3 letterbox, and 16 : 9 widescreen. MPEG- 2 is the selected image compression format, with full ITU Rec. 601 video resolution (72 Ox 480). MPEG- 2 and AC- 3 are also part of the U. S. high definition Advance Television standard (ATV). DVD has an average video bit rate of 3. 5 Mbits/sec or 4. 69 Mbits/sec for image and sound. Unlike digital television transmission, which will use fixed length packets for audio and video, DVD will use variable length packets with a maximum throughput of more than 1 OMbits/sec. The higher bit rate allows for less compression of difficult to encode material. Even with all the compression, narrow-beam red light lasers are required to significantly increase the physical data density of a platter by decreasing the size of the pits. This allows 4. 7 gigabytes of data on a single sided, single layer DVD. The maximum 17 gigabyte capacity is achieved by employing two reflective layers {{on both sides of the}} disk. To read the imbedded layer of data, the laser`s focal length is altered so that the top layer pits are not picked up by the reader. It will be a couple of years before we have dual-layer, double-sided DVDS, and it will be achieved in four stages. The first format to appear will be the single sided, single layer disk (4. 7 gigabytes). That will allow Hollywood to begin releasing DVD movie titles. DVD-ROM will be the next phase, allowing 4. 7 gigabytes of CD-ROM-like content. The third stage will be write-once disks, and stage four will be <b>rewritable</b> <b>disks.</b> These last stages presents some issues which have yet to be resolved. For one, copyrighted materials may have some form of payment system, and there is the issue that erasable disks reflect less light than today`s DVDS. The problem here is that their data most likely will not be readable on earlier built players...|$|R
