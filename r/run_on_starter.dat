25|$|The Blue Jays' 2008 season {{featured}} a strong pitching staff, which led {{the major leagues}} with a 3.49 ERA. For much of the season, however, the team struggled to hit home runs and drive in <b>runs.</b> <b>On</b> May 24, <b>starter</b> Jesse Litsch set a team record, with 38 consecutive innings without giving up a walk. On June 20, following a five-game losing streak and with the Jays in last place in the AL East, management fired John Gibbons and several members of his coaching staff, and re-hired Cito Gaston. Meanwhile, Alex Ríos had 32 stolen bases, making him the first Blue Jay with 30 since 2001. On September 5, Roy Halladay earned his 129th career win, moving him into second spot on Toronto's all-time wins list. Halladay also came second in the voting for the Cy Young Award, after posting a 20–11 record and 2.78 ERA.|$|R

Again it was Timo Pérez sparking the Mets, singling under the glove of Édgar Rentería, stealing second base and moving to third when catcher Carlos Hernández's throw went into center field. Edgardo Alfonzo would single home Perez. Following a walk to Mike Piazza, Robin Ventura would single home Alfonzo for the Mets' second run.

50|$|The game began {{shortly after}} 4 p.m. with Greg Maddux {{pitching}} for Atlanta and Masato Yoshii starting for the Mets. The Mets took an early 2-0 {{lead in the}} bottom of the first inning as John Olerud hit his second home run in as many days with Rickey Henderson on first. The lead lasted into the fourth inning, when Atlanta struck back with consecutive doubles by Bret Boone and Chipper Jones, eventually knotting the score at 2-2 when Brian Jordan singled home Jones. Mets Manager Bobby Valentine was immediately prompted to remove Yoshii from the game in favor of Orel Hershiser, which began a <b>run</b> <b>on</b> pitching changes that resulted in the Mets emptying their bullpen by game's end, relying <b>on</b> <b>starter</b> Kenny Rogers and rookie Octavio Dotel for key innings, and might have gone to Game 4's starter Rick Reed had the game progressed past the fifteenth inning. In all, the Mets used a postseason record nine pitchers in this game.|$|R
