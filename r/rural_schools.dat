5|$|In March 2012, the U.S. Senate {{added an}} {{amendment}} to the surface transportation bill that authorized a one-year extension to the Secure <b>Rural</b> <b>Schools</b> and Community Self-Determination Act. Oregon counties would have received a total of $102 million from the legislation in 2012, to be divided among all 33 counties that currently receive payments. In 2008, Oregon received $250 million from the program. The full transportation bill, including the amendment, passed the Senate by a 74–22 vote, but the U.S. House of Representatives refused to vote on the Senate bill, instead passing a three-month extension to the current transportation bill that did not contain a county payments extension. In July 2012, the Secure <b>Rural</b> <b>Schools</b> Act renewal amendment was included in the transportation bill approved by Congress and signed by the President. This was widely expected to be the last renewal of the program, but in September 2013, Congress passed another one-year extension to the program, though again at reduced levels.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Education, Washington State UniversityThe {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to explore}} the role of the <b>rural</b> <b>school</b> district superintendent as instructional leader. Specifically, the study focused on rural superintendents who were known as effective instructional leaders and explored their understandings of and motivations for their instructional leadership work, how they fulfilled this work, and how this work was affected by recent federal and state policy initiatives. The study addressed these questions: (a) what are <b>rural</b> <b>school</b> district superintendents’ understandings of their role and responsibilities as instructional leader?; (b) what are <b>rural</b> <b>school</b> district superintendents’ perspectives on the various facets of instructional leadership?; (c) what do <b>rural</b> <b>school</b> district superintendents actually do to fulfill their roles as instructional leaders?; (d) what are <b>rural</b> <b>school</b> district superintendents’ perspectives on their preparation for instructional leadership and their need for continuous professional development?; and (e) how has recent federal and state legislation affected the work of the <b>rural</b> <b>school</b> superintendent as instructional leader? Data were collected through open-ended, phenomenologically oriented interviews with four <b>rural</b> <b>school</b> district superintendents in northeast Washington State. Analysis of the qualitative data resulted in the unearthing of seven major themes: (a) setting direction, (b) supporting the instructional growth of the district, (c) the superintendents’ direct involvement with the classroom, (d) acquiring resources for the instructional program, (e) the superintendents’ work developing principal instructional leadership, (f) the self-development of the district instructional leader, and (g) challenges faced by <b>rural</b> <b>school</b> district instructional leaders. Each theme also discussed the impact of the rural district context on that theme. Four conclusions were drawn from the study: (a) <b>rural</b> <b>school</b> district superintendents communicate a focus on improved teaching and learning by being heavily engaged in the classrooms observing teaching; (b) <b>rural</b> <b>school</b> district superintendents engage with other rural districts to provide aligned and collaborative professional development; (c) superintendents rely heavily on one another to lead instructionally; and (d) the remote context provides <b>rural</b> <b>school</b> district superintendents with additional and unique challenges to instructional leadership. My hope is that this study will inform effective rural superintendent instructional leadership and lead to discussions regarding policy and research to support superintendents facing rural contextual leadership challenges.

40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed at}} finding out two questions: 1). what are rural English teachers’ beliefs about English in a <b>rural</b> <b>school</b> in facing the modern era?; and 2). {{to what extent}} is English important in a <b>rural</b> <b>school</b> related to its global role viewed from teachers’ belief?. This paper utilized qualitative method in the form of case study. The respondents of the study were three English teachers from a <b>rural</b> <b>school.</b> The data were gathered through observation and interview then analyzed through the interactive model which consists of data reduction, data display, and conclusion: drawing/verification.
