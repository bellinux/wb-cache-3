However, the Reuleaux triangle is the rotor with the minimum possible area. As it rotates, its axis does not stay fixed at a single point, but instead follows a curve formed by the pieces of four ellipses. Because of its 120° angles, the rotating Reuleaux triangle cannot <b>reach</b> <b>some</b> points near the sharper angles at the square's vertices, but rather covers a shape with slightly rounded corners, also formed by elliptical arcs.|$|E

In his later, lengthier, statement, he indicated that although it had been Michelin's failure to provide a reliable tyre which had initiated the events, he laid the full blame for the failure to <b>reach</b> <b>some</b> accommodation (which would have allowed a race to happen, {{for the benefit of}} the many fans who had paid considerable money for travel and tickets) at the feet of Max Mosley and the FIA, with a small share of the blame going to what he characterized as the obstructionist Ferrari team leader, Jean Todt. He furthermore called for Mosley's resignation.|$|E

5|$|In 2017, David E. Hone and Thomas R. Holtz {{pointed out}} that (like other theropods) {{there was no reason}} to believe that the forelimbs of Baryonyx were able to pronate, and thereby make it able to rest or walk on its palms. Resting on or using the forelimbs for {{locomotion}} may have been possible (as indicated by tracks of a resting theropod), but if this was the norm, the forelimbs would probably have showed adaptations for this. Hone and Holtz furthermore suggested that the forelimbs of spinosaurids do not seem optimal for trapping prey, but instead appear similar to the forelimbs of digging animals. They suggested that the ability to dig would have been useful when excavating nests, digging for water, or to <b>reach</b> <b>some</b> kinds of prey. Hone and Holtz also believed that spinosaurids would have waded and dipped in water rather than submerging themselves, due to their sparsity of aquatic adaptations.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the Athenians had attempted to negotiate with the Persians previously. Plutarch suggests that {{in the aftermath of the}} victory at the Eurymedon, Artaxerxes had agreed a peace treaty with the Greeks, even naming Callias as the Athenian ambassador involved. However, as Plutarch admits, Callisthenes denied that such a peace was made at this point (c. 466 BC). Herodotus also mentions, in passing, an Athenian embassy headed by Callias, which was sent to Susa to negotiate with Artaxerxes. This embassy included some Argive representatives and can probably be therefore dated to c. 461 BC (after an alliance was agreed between Athens and Argos). This embassy may have been an attempt to <b>reach</b> <b>some</b> kind of peace agreement, and it has even been suggested that the failure of these hypothetical negotiations led to the Athenian decision to support the Egyptian revolt. The ancient sources therefore disagree as to whether there was an official peace or not, and, if there was, when it was agreed.|$|E

25|$|A {{largely unknown}} Kerry Packer arrived in London in late May 1977. He {{appeared}} on David Frost's The Frost Programme to debate his concept with commentators Jim Laker and Robin Marlar.

25|$|Among Tom Ligon's many {{short and}} {{medium-sized}} works (and one award-winning science fact {{article published in}} relation to Fusion rocket technology and advocate of Inertial Electrodynamic Fusion), two published in 1986 and 1993, The Devil and the Deep Black Void, and The Gardener in Analog Magazine, are science fiction stories which are about a Shi'a Muslim terrorist organization in a largely Muslim space-faring civilization where Bahá'ís are space colonists who undertake terraforming on a planet they named Mazra'ih (though there is brief mention of a United States National Spiritual Assembly back on Earth.) The prequel, For a Little Price about how terrorists are prevented from crashing a spaceship into the Earth (long predating {{the events of the}} September 11, 2001 attacks) was anthologized in 2008 though work began on it in 1986. In the succeeding stories some of the terrorists are instead driven to an unusual world orbiting a neutron star where Bahá'ís live which eventually reveals that civilizations have reached great levels of technology and then mysteriously disappeared. The initial thought is that the civilizations are eradicated by a periodic sterilization the planet undergoes but there is also evidence the civilizations vanished peacefully before the sterilization speculating that civilizations shortly after achieving deep space exploration <b>reach</b> <b>some</b> new level of civilization that doesn't require or sustain material civilization in deep space. The ethical conflict of pacifism, a debatable stance associated with the Bahá'í Faith, in the face of terrorists is worked out. One character, who takes on the name of the historical Bábí who performed an assassination attempt on the life of the Shah of Iran, chooses the path of violence in defense of the population by way (as portrayed) of matching a strength of the Bahá'í Faith in acceptance of science compared to a weakness of Shia Islam of superstition.|$|E

500|$|The {{flammability}} of the crinoline {{was widely}} reported. It is estimated that, {{during the late}} 1850s and late 1860s in England, about 3,000 women were killed in crinoline-related fires. One such incident, {{the death of a}} 14-year-old kitchenmaid called Margaret Davey was reported in The Times on 13 February 1863. Her dress, [...] "distended by a crinoline," [...] ignited as she stood on the fender of the fireplace to <b>reach</b> <b>some</b> spoons on the mantelpiece, and she {{died as a result of}} extensive burns. The Deputy-Coroner, commenting that he was [...] "astonished to think that the mortality from such a fashion was not brought more conspicuously under the notice of the Registrar-General," [...] passed a verdict of [...] "Accidental death by fire, caused through crinoline." [...] A similar case was reported later that year, when 16-year-old Emma Musson died after a piece of burning coke rolled from the kitchen fire to ignite her crinoline. A month later, on 8 December 1863, a serious fire at the Church of the Company of Jesus in Santiago, Chile, killed between two and three thousand people. The severity of the death toll is credited in part to the large amounts of flammable fabric that made up the women's crinoline dresses. Two notable victims of crinoline fires were William Wilde's illegitimate daughters, Emily and Mary, who died in November 1871 of burns sustained after their evening gowns caught fire. Slaveykov reported in 1864 that over the last 14 years, at least 39,927 women worldwide had died in crinoline-related fires, opining that it was more deadly than the practice of sati or the auto-da-fé. Although flame-retardant fabrics were available, these were thought unattractive and were unpopular.|$|E
