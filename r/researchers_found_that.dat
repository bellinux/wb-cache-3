5|$|Because {{submarines}} at {{the surface}} could see the dark shape of an attacking aircraft against the night sky, the principle of diffused lighting camouflage also applied to aircraft. However, British <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the amount of electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft's underside in daylight was prohibitive, while externally mounted light projectors disturbed the aircraft's aerodynamics.|$|E
5|$|In a paper {{published}} in 2009, <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> mockingbirds {{were able to}} recall an individual human who, earlier in the study, had approached and threatened the mockingbirds' nest. Researchers had one participant stand near a mockingbird nest and touch it, while others avoided the nest. Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{there were}} 4,822 {{same-sex}} couples in the District of Columbia in 2010; about 2% of total households. Legislation authorizing same-sex marriage passed in 2009 and the District began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in March 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Maarit Varitia, a {{workplace}} bullying <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 20% of interviewees, who experienced workplace bullying thought {{the reason why}} they became a target is they are different from others. [...] Bullying can increase more bullying in workplace.|$|R
25|$|For example, one <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> between 1958 and 1987, Japanese life {{satisfaction}} fluctuated around 6 on a 10-point scale, while Denmark’s fluctuated around 8. Comparing ethnic {{groups within the}} United States, another study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> European Americans reported being “significantly happier” with their lives than Asian Americans.|$|R
5000|$|Authorization flaws: Another {{possible}} {{problem is}} mistaking authentication with authorization. The <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> several web-based password managers had, {{at one point}} in time, such flaws. These issues were in particular present in password managers which allowed users to share credentials with other users.|$|R
5|$|The use {{of small}} and large fish in the local economy was analyzed. <b>Researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> while the less common large fish are sold for profit, the diet of Pak Mun villagers {{consisted}} mostly of small fish which can be caught in both the wet and dry seasons. Small fish are eaten, sold, and traded with the hill peoples for rice.|$|E
5|$|INGEMMET (Instituto Geológico Minero y Metalúrgico) of Peru {{released}} internally on September 21 {{a report}} on the Carancas meteorite fall. The release of the document to the public was delayed for one week. The <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the fragments from the crater zone had a chondritic texture and the following mineral composition: pyroxene (1) 40%, olivine 20%, feldspar 10%, pyroxene (2) 10%; kamacite 15%, troilite 5%, and traces of chromite and native copper. Kamacite occurs naturally only in meteorites.|$|E
5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. <b>Researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E
50|$|As of 2016, five {{indirect}} taxes {{had been added}} to goods and services. At 23%, the value added tax {{is one of the}} Eurozone's highest, exceeding other EU countries on small and medium-sized enterprises. One <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the poorest households faced tax increases of 337%.|$|R
50|$|Retroactive Interference {{has also}} been {{investigated}} using pitch perception as the learning medium. The <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the presentation of subsequent stimuli in succession causes a decrease in recalled accuracy. Massaro <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the presentation of successive auditory tones, confused perceptual short term memory, causing Retroactive Interference as the new tone inhibits the retrieval of previously heard tones.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the images of}} African Americans in black-themed sitcoms and mediated messages presented here. The study {{was based on the}} premise that the images of African Americans on television sitcoms are one dimensional and comedic. A content analysis approach was used to analyze various television sitcoms. Definitions were used to determine what type of image existed using the foundation provided by Donald Bogle and Stewart Hall. The <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> although many of the African-American-themed sitcoms investigated represented traditional stereotypical images, there were mediated messages in these sitcoms, which offered a new and different perspective on African Americans. This suggests that African-American images on black-themed sitcoms are moving forward. Additionally, the <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> sitcoms depicting African-American life from a comedic point-of-view seem to be more acceptable in popular culture than those which depict life from a dramatic and/or realistic point-of-view...|$|R
5|$|Insect {{damage to}} the fossilized leaves of {{flowering}} plants from fourteen sites in North America were used {{as a proxy for}} insect diversity across the K–Pg boundary and analyzed to determine the rate of extinction. <b>Researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Cretaceous sites, prior to the extinction event, had rich plant and insect-feeding diversity. During the early Paleocene, however, flora were relatively diverse with little predation from insects, even 1.7million years after the extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Longrich et al. {{pointed out}} that the robust forelimbs and {{enlargement}} of a single finger in ingeniine oviraptorids is similar to that seen in modern animals that eat ants and termites, such as anteaters and pangolins, but the morpholology of ingeniine jaws does not support them being insectivorous. The <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the function of ingeniine forelimbs was unclear, but suggested that they could have been used for scratching, tearing, or digging, though not prey capture.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{was that the}} silver iodide would cause supercooled water in the storm to freeze, disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane. This led to the seeding of several Atlantic hurricanes. However, it was later shown that this {{hypothesis was}} incorrect. It was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective. Additionally, <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes. This finding called Stormfury's successes into question, as the changes reported now had a natural explanation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Researchers</b> have <b>found</b> <b>that</b> framing-manipulation {{invariably}} affects subjects, but {{to varying}} degrees. Individuals proved risk averse {{when presented with}} value-increasing options; but when faced with value decreasing contingencies, they tended towards increased risk-taking. <b>Researchers</b> [...] <b>found</b> <b>that</b> variations in decision-framing achieved by manipulating the options to represent either a gain or as a loss altered the risk-aversion preferences of decision-makers.|$|R

5|$|The nuclear {{properties}} of plutonium-239 were also studied; <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{when it is}} hit by a neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction. This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass.|$|E
5|$|This bird may {{sometimes}} join mixed-species feeding flocks in winter, {{but it does}} not appear to share the resources found by accompanying tits and goldcrests, and may just be benefiting from the extra vigilance of a flock. Wood ants share the same habitat as the treecreeper, and also feed on invertebrates on tree trunks. The Finnish <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> where the ants have been foraging, there are fewer arthropods, and male treecreepers spent a shorter time on spruce trunks visited by ants.|$|E
5|$|P. rebeli live in {{different}} habitats; therefore, {{they do not}} parasitize the same Myrmica ant species. Through observation and experimentation, <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> if P. rebeli try to parasitize a different Myrmica ant species than the one they normally do, the Myrmica ants will identify the P. rebeli larvae as intruders and will kill 100% of the P. rebeli larvae. The differences between the P. rebeli are that they synthesize different hydrocarbons, which allow them to mimic different species of Myrmica ants. This explains why they have no success in being mistaken for another species of Myrmica ant and the ensuing 100% mortality rate when the other Myrmica ant species is not fooled.|$|E

25|$|As climate-controlled, {{suburban}} {{shopping centers}} became {{common in the}} 1960s, communities began to explore ways of drawing retail and entertainment business back into downtown areas. An experimental method of encouraging business was a downtown mall. One <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> approximately 200 pedestrian malls were constructed in the United States by {{the close of the}} 20th century, although only 15 remained in 2013.|$|R
50|$|In April 2013, Conrad Longmore, a cyber {{security}} <b>researcher,</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> xHamster and PornHub were attacked with malvertisements.In September 2015, xHamster {{was hit with}} another malvertising attack along with YouPorn and PornHub. TrafficHaus reported {{that it might be}} the result of a breach. On 28 November 2016 it was revealed the usernames, email addresses, and passwords of 380,000 users were stolen.|$|R
5|$|Suillus luteus fruit {{bodies are}} {{sometimes}} infested with larvae, though {{not nearly as}} often as S.granulatus or B.edulis. Damage from maggots is much more common in warmer months, and rare {{late in the season}} with cooler weather. In a Finnish study, <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 70–95% of fruit bodies collected from typical forest habitats were infested with larvae; the most common species were the flies Mycetophila fungorum, Pegomya deprimata, and Pegohylemyia silvatica. In contrast, other studies have shown that fruit bodies collected from pine plantations are relatively free of larvae. The fungus produces microscopic crystals of oxalic acid at the surface of its hyphae, a feature that is thought to help deter grazing by the springtail species Folsomia candida.|$|E
5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and the <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E
5|$|To {{test this}} hypothesis, {{researchers}} examined how each species utilized the host ants. The M. schencki, M. sabuleti are parasitized by P. rebeli while the M. salina and M. vandeli are parasitized by the P. alcon. The M. scabrinodis is parasitized {{by both the}} P. rebeli and the P. alcon; however, the P. alcon is {{far more likely to}} parasitize M. scabrinodis than the P. rebeli. <b>Researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> in general, P. alcon was far more likely to parasitize the host ant than P. rebeli; however, ant nests that supported the P. alcon were much smaller and supported lower populations than ant nests that supported P. rebeli.|$|E
50|$|An April 2013 EPS PEAKS paper found {{a strong}} and {{well-established}} case for donors to intervene in private markets to deliver subsidies for development purposes. The <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the theoretical reasons for intervention were well established by the economics literature, but that the practical approaches and frameworks for delivering subsidies to private sector entities are more complex and less understood.|$|R
50|$|Some manual {{overrides}} {{can be used}} to veto {{an automated}} system's judgment when the system is in error. An example of this is a printer's ink level detection: in one case, a <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> when he overrode the system, up to 38% more pages could be printed at good quality by the printer than the automated system would have allowed.|$|R

5|$|A study {{conducted}} at the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) published in 2014 found that many car dealers are less than enthusiastic about plug-in vehicles. ITS conducted 43 interviews with six automakers and 20 new car dealers selling plug-in vehicles in California’s major metro markets. The study also analyzed national and state-level J.D. Power 2013 Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) study data on customer satisfaction with new car dealerships and Tesla retail stores. The <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> buyers of plug-in electric vehicles were significantly less satisfied and rated the dealer purchase experience much lower than buyers of non-premium conventional cars, while Tesla Motors earned industry-high scores. According to the findings, plug-in buyers expect more from dealers than conventional buyers, including product knowledge and support that extends beyond traditional offerings.|$|E
5|$|Based upon data {{taken from}} the United States using these methods, cirrus cloud cover was found to vary diurnally and seasonally. The <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> in the summer, at noon, the cover is the lowest, {{with an average of}} 23% of the United States' land area covered by cirrus. Around midnight, the cloud cover {{increases}} to around 28%. In winter, the cirrus cloud cover did not vary appreciably from day to night. These percentages include clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other cloud types, as lack of cirrus cloud cover. When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth's surface. In the tropical regions, this cloud covers around 70% of the region's surface area.|$|E
5|$|From these models, {{researchers}} also predict that bee populations will start declining most {{significantly in the}} southern latitudes with lagging range expansion in the north. Kerr and his colleagues found that as the climate has shifted, bumblebees {{have been forced to}} operate outside of their thermal ranges, causing range losses along the species’ southern limits. However, the study also found that while other flora and fauna have expanded their northerly ranges to account for the climate shifts, bumblebees have not expanded farther north. The most important findings in this study came from statistical models built to study whether or not these range shifts were due to confounding factors such as pesticide use or changes in land cover. The <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> climate change had the most meaningful impact on range shifts and bee distributions. To support these findings, the scientists note that failure for the bumblebee to respond to thermal changes and expand their northern range underscores the idea that bumblebees are susceptible to climate change.|$|E
50|$|Several {{other animal}} species have been {{observed}} living within the gumboot's gills; the relationship {{is thought to be}} commensal: neither harmful nor helpful to the chiton. One <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{more than a quarter of}} gumboots hosted an Arctonoe vittata, a pale yellow scale worm which can grow up to 10 cm length. Opisthopus transversus, a small crab, is also sometimes found within the gills.|$|R
