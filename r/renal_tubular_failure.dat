40|$|Background: Hypercalcemia is an {{endocrine}} emergency {{that should}} be diagnosed {{as soon as possible}} and managed carefully. For better management multiple causes of hypercalcemia must be taken into consideration. Case presentation: We observed three infants with hypercalcemia and distal <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> acidosis at the time of diagnosis during 5 years. The patients were referred with severe dehydration and failure to thrive. Conclusion: There was no reason for hypercalcemia found in these patients except distal <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> acidosis. So we suggest distal <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> acidosis as a cause for hypercalcemia. Key Words: Hypercalcemia; Distal <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> acidosis; RTA; <b>Failure</b> to thriv...|$|R

40|$|Previously we {{reported}} that the consecutive injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into LPS-sensitized mice for the generalized Shwartzman reaction (GSR) appeared to induce the injury of <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells via apoptosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the mechanism of <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cell injury in GSR. The expression of Fas and Fas ligand was immunohistochemically detected on <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells from GSR-induced mice, although neither Fas nor Fas ligand was found in cells from untreated control mice or in cells from mice receiving a single injection of LPS. GSR-induced <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cell injury was produced in neither Fas-negative MRL-lpr/lpr mice nor Fas ligand-negative MRL-gld/gld mice. The administration of anti-gamma interferon antibody together with a preparative injection of LPS prevented the expression of Fas and Fas ligand and the apoptosis of <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells. A provocative injection of tumor necrosis factor alpha into LPS-sensitized mice augmented Fas and Fas ligand expression and the apoptosis of <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells. The administration of tumor necrosis factor alpha to interleukin- 12 -sensitized mice resulted in Fas and Fas ligand expression and the apoptosis. Sensitization with interleukin- 12 together with anti-gamma interferon antibody did not cause the apoptosis of <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells. It was suggested that the Fas/Fas ligand system probably plays a critical role in the development of <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cell injury through apoptotic cell death...|$|R

40|$|The {{intracellular}} mechanisms underlying <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> {{epithelial cell}} proliferation and tubular repair following ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) remain poorly understood. In this report, we demonstrate that activator of G-protein signaling 3 (AGS 3), an unconventional receptor-independent regulator of heterotrimeric G-protein function, influences <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> regeneration following IRI. In rat kidneys exposed to IRI, {{there was a}} temporal induction in renal AGS 3 protein expression that peaked 72 h after reperfusion and corresponded to the repair and recovery phase following ischemic injury. Renal AGS 3 expression was localized predominantly to the recovering outer medullary proximal tubular cells and was highly coexpressed with Ki- 67, a marker of cell proliferation. Kidneys from mice deficient in the expression of AGS 3 exhibited impaired <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> recovery 7 d following IRI compared to wild-type AGS 3 -expressing mice. Mechanistically, genetic knockdown of endogenous AGS 3 mRNA and protein in <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells reduced cell proliferation in vitro. Similar reductions in <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cell proliferation were observed following incubation with gallein, a selective inhibitor of Gβγ subunit activity, and lentiviral overexpression of the carboxyl-terminus of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK 2 ct), a scavenger of Gβγ subunits. In summary, {{these data suggest that}} AGS 3 acts through a novel receptor-independent mechanism to facilitate <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cell proliferation and <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> regeneration. —Regner, K.

40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 50 -year old male patient {{presenting}} with a combination of chondrocalcinosis and osteoporosis related to a <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> disorder. Laboratory studies revealed hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia with renal wastage and metabolic alkalosis, compatible with a <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> transport disorder with similarities to Bartter's and Gitelman's syndrome. Calcifications of the menisci and cartilage on X-rays of knee joints suggested chondrocalcinosis, which has been associated with Gitelman's syndrome. Radiologically suspected osteopenia was confirmed by a bone density scan that revealed osteoporosis of the vertebral column. An association of osteoporosis with hypercalciuria, which commonly occurs in Bartter's syndrome patients, has been reported. Upon treatment of the <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> disorder with spironolactone and a thiazide diuretic in combination with calcium and magnesium supplementation, the electrolyte abnormalities resolved and arthralgias disappeared. Our case demonstrates a <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> dysfunction with features of both Bartter's and Gitelman's syndrome along with concurrent chondrocalcinosis and osteoporosis. Furthermore, the occurrence of osteoporosis in this relatively young patient, in the absence of other risk factors, demonstrates that <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> disorders should be suspected in presenile osteoporosis. Vice versa, since osteoporosis usually is asymptomatic before fracturing, patients with <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> disorders should be examined for osteoporosis...|$|R
40|$|Hypokalemia is a {{recognized}} cause of rhabdomyolysis {{but very few}} reports document its association with inborn <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> disorders.

The inborn <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> disorders underlying rhabdomyolysis were classic distal <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> acidosis (n = 7), Gitelman syndrome (n = 5), classic Bartter syndrome (n = 1), and antenatal Bartter syndrome (n = 1).

40|$|Sensitisation to a <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> antigen, Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein, {{has been}} shown to be common in {{patients}} with <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> acidosis complicating autoimmune liver disease, and it has been suggested that this immune reaction, by damaging <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> cells, might be responsible for the acidification defect. The lymphocytes from 10 out of 13 patients with chronic active hepatitis or primary biliary cirrhosis and an associated <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> acidosis were shown to be cytotoxic for a kidney cell line known to secrete Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein. The cytotoxic reaction was blocked by this antigen, but not by two other proteins, indicating that sensitisation to the renal glycoprotein was the likely cause of the target cell damage. Significant reduction in cytotoxicity after the addition of aggregated IgG suggested that the reaction was of the antibody-dependent cell-mediated type. These results, together with the finding of antigenic material in the surface membrane of liver cells that cross reacts immunologically with Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein, provide an explanation for the association between chronic liver disease and <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|Guannan Yang, Zongjiang Zhao, Xinxue Zhang, Amin Wu, Yawei Huang, Yonghui Miao, Meijuan Yang School of Basic Medical Science, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, People’s Republic of China Abstract: <b>Renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial-to-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) and <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> interstitial fibrosis {{are the main}} pathological changes of diabetic nephropathy (DN), which is a common cause of end-stage renal disease. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} berberine (BBR) has antifibrotic effects in the kidney and can reduce apoptosis and inhibit the EMT of podocytes in DN. However, the effect of BBR on the <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> EMT in DN and its mechanisms of action are unknown. This study was performed to explore the effects of BBR on the <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> EMT and the molecular mechanisms of BBR in DN model KKAy mice and on the high glucose (HG) -induced EMT in mouse <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells. Our results showed that, relative to the model mice, the mice in the treatment group had an improved general state and reduced blood glucose and 24 -h urinary protein levels. Degradation of renal function was ameliorated by BBR. We also observed the protective effects of BBR on renal structural changes, including normalization of an index of renal interstitial fibrosis and kidney weight/body weight. Moreover, BBR suppressed the activation of the Notch/snail pathway and upregulated the α-SMA and E-cadherin levels in DN model KKAy mice. BBR was further found to prevent HG-induced EMT events and to inhibit the HG-induced expression of Notch pathway members and snail 1 in mouse <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells. Our findings indicate that BBR has a therapeutic effect on DN, including its inhibition of the <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> EMT and <b>renal</b> interstitial fibrosis.
