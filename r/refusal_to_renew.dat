The coal company stayed quiet, and {{when the time came}} to renew the health care and retirement benefit plans for its workers, Pittston refused. The <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>renew</b> the contract left about 1,500 people without health care. These people were not just miners employed by Pittston, but also families, widows, and disabled miners in the Virginia area.|$|E

In September 2007, she criticized the appointment of PRD politician Pedro Miguel González, who was wanted in the US for the murder of US Army sergeant Zak Hernández, as the head of the National Assembly.

25|$|In April 1989 the Kumar brothers, {{owners of}} a {{clothing}} chain, bought 84% of the club. A rapid turnover of managers, the absence of promised investment, and a threatened mass <b>refusal</b> of players <b>to</b> <b>renew</b> contracts was relieved only by a victorious trip to Wembley in the Associate Members Cup. Terry Cooper delivered promotion, but a bank collapse put the Kumars' businesses into receivership. David Sullivan bought the club out of administration for £700,000 and installed the 23-year-old Karren Brady as managing director.

[...] The children had originally used passports with the substitute names Drengur (boy) and Stúlka (girl); however, in 2014, Icelandic authorities refused to renew Harriet's passport at all without a legally acceptable name. [...] Since the Cardews were about to travel to France, they obtained emergency British passports for Duncan and Harriet; the parents also announced they would file a formal complaint objecting to the naming committee's rejection of their children's names and the passport office's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>renew</b> their Icelandic passports. The Cardews announced in June 2016 that they had won their case and their children's names would be recognised. As a result of this case, the Icelandic Interior Ministry announced it had begun the legislative process to abolish the Naming Committee.|$|E

Liberty must, no doubt, be respected in so far that no manager {{should have the right to}} refuse admission to decently dressed, sober, and well-conducted persons, whether they are prostitutes, soldiers in uniform, gentlemen not in evening dress, Indians, or what not; but when disorder is stopped, disorderly persons will either cease to come or else reform their manners. It is, however, quite arguable that the indiscriminate issue of free admissions, though an apparently innocent and good- natured, and certainly a highly popular proceeding, should expose the proprietor of the theatre to the risk of a <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>renew</b> his licence.|$|E

After one more year, Fry was sacked to make way for the return of Trevor Francis.|$|R

The Oath also inspired a wide variety of revolutionary activity in the months afterwards, ranging from rioting across the French countryside <b>to</b> <b>renewed</b> calls for a written French constitution. Likewise, it reinforced the Assembly's strength and forced the King to formally request that voting occur based on head, not power.|$|R
