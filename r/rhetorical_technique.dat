For instance, in Pish-Tush's song [...] "Our great Mikado, virtuous man", he sings: [...] "The youth who winked a roving eye / Or breathed a non-connubial sigh / Was thereupon {{condemned}} to die– / He usually objected." [...] The term for this <b>rhetorical</b> <b>technique</b> is meiosis, a drastic understatement of the situation. [...] Other examples of this are when self-decapitation is described as [...] "an extremely difficult, not to say dangerous, thing to attempt", and also as merely [...] "awkward". When a discussion occurs of Nanki-Poo's life being [...] "cut short in a month", the tone remains comic and only mock-melancholy. Burial alive is described as [...] "a stuffy death". Finally, execution by boiling oil or by melted lead is described by the Mikado as a [...] "humorous but lingering" [...] punishment.|$|E

Language and conversation arise when the human express and convey his mind to other human. In {{the history of the}} world rhetoric or speech is the main instrument to influence the masses. Language used to convince others. Inability to use language, so it does not clearly reveal problems or thoughts will bring negative impact in the life and work of a leader. Therefore, for leaders, the rhetoric is an important tool to influence and control over man. Because in society generally sought the leaders or influential people, who have skill in speaking terms. While according to Wendy Olmstead (2006 : 1) state that rhetoric as a practical art of deliberation and judgment that can best be taught and learned through historically specific examples of argument and interpretation. Besides, the theory of Shel Leanne chosen to understand and help the process of analysing the data. There are the <b>rhetorical</b> <b>techniques</b> that focus to present the ideas powerfully are: Rhetorical Question, Conduplicatio, anaphora, epistrophe, mesodiplosis, alliteration, asyndeton, polysyndeton, and tricolon. While <b>rhetorical</b> <b>techniques</b> that focus enable to sway listeners are: procatalepsis, nonrhetorical questions and juxtaposition. The Objective of the Research is to find out the <b>rhetorical</b> <b>techniques</b> of Barrack Obama‘s speech in the University of Indonesia about cooperation between America & Indonesia countries in the archive article (time edition: 10 November 2010). This research is documentation analysis and the method used is content analysis. The researcher herself as an instrument of this research. The technique of data analysis is data coding. The result of collecting and analysing the data show that the <b>rhetorical</b> <b>techniques</b> used by Barrack Obama in his speech are Conduplicatio, anaphora, epistrophe, mesodiplosis, alliteration, asyndeton, polysyndeton, tricolon, procatalepsis, and juxtaposition. But that most used the <b>rhetorical</b> <b>techniques</b> is polysyndeton by made a diagram of it. Polysyndeton occurs when a conjunction, such as ―and‖ that is used between every word, clause, or phrase. It is used in the Barack Obama‘s speech in the University of Indonesia about cooperation between America & Indonesia iii countries in the archive article. Moreover, there are many <b>rhetorical</b> <b>techniques</b> that are used by Barack Obama. It means that Barack Obama always use <b>rhetorical</b> <b>techniques</b> in his speech, especially Polysyndeton are dominated the <b>rhetorical</b> <b>techniques</b> in the research‘s object.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{investigate}} whether people consider someone a charismatic speaker because they are deploying the generic features commonly identified as being associated with charismatic oratory in the literature, or whether the attribution of charisma is informed by factors which vary across different settings. Video-taped extracts from speeches given by seven people widely regarded as influential thought leaders – Kenneth Blanchard, Stephen Covey, Daniel Goleman, Gary Hamel, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Tom Peters and Peter Senge – were shown to different audiences. After viewing each extract they rated {{the extent to which}} they found the speaker charismatic or non-charismatic and why. In addition, the whole speeches and focal messages were content analysed for the presence a number of factors – delivery, <b>rhetorical</b> <b>techniques,</b> abstraction and inclusion – identified in the previous literature as underpinning charismatic oratory. When the speeches are taken as a whole the speakers rated as charismatic differed significantly from their non-charismatic counterparts only in terms of delivery. For focal sentences delivery remains significant but in addition the speakers rated as charismatic use a higher proportion of <b>rhetorical</b> <b>techniques.</b> This has important implications for theory and practice that are elaborated...|$|R
40|$|Student use {{of rhetoric}} can {{provide insight into}} student {{learning}} since rhetoric is, in part, epistemological. Epistemology refers {{to the study of}} the way someone thinks about a topic. Rhetoric is epistemological, therefore, because rhetoric is, at its core, the way ideas are thought about and expressed. Therefore, identifying and analyzing student usage of <b>rhetorical</b> <b>techniques</b> has the potential to allow a glimpse at the epistemological state of the student mind concerning their rhetorical learning. Insight drawn from knowing what students do and do not know concerning rhetoric could be extremely valuable to teachers in that it could pinpoint opportunities for greater learning. It could also be very valuable to STEM teachers, considering that science, math, and technology are need areas in both academia and the rest of the world. Finding ways to teach students to be more effective communicators, especially in mathematical, scientific, or technological contexts, then, is a topic that ought to receive attention because it provides the foundation for students’ later achievements. In light of the importance of examining the rhetorical learning accomplished by students in connection with the sciences, I have investigated the <b>rhetorical</b> appeals and <b>techniques</b> used by students in the University of Northern Iowa Spring 2014 College Writing and Research course focused on writing in the life sciences. Since this course is partly focused on the sciences, seeing the connections between rhetorical learning and scientific discourse will be an easier process due to the fact that students will be learning about rhetoric and expressing it in both scientific and non-scientific assignments. My goal in this study is to answer the following two research questions: what kinds of <b>rhetorical</b> <b>techniques</b> and practices do students in a composition class use? and what do these <b>rhetorical</b> <b>techniques</b> and practices say about these students’ epistemological understanding of rhetoric? My answers to these questions will not be definitive, but they may be indicative of the ways in which the rhetoric is an important aspect of composition for the sciences, due to its foundational place in the educational life of all students, including those going into the sciences...|$|R

Whereas, the Greeks took the notion of pistis as persuasive discourse that was elliptical and concentrated on the [...] "affect and effect rather than on the representation of the truth."

Preachers need to practice again and again (DDC 4.3.4) so that they can use these styles in any situation of preaching (DDC 4.19.38). But they should pay attention to the priority of order. Continuous and diligent study of the Bible is more important than mere memorization, that is to say, they should pursue wisdom more than knowledge (DDC 4.5.7). The best is the combination of wisdom and eloquence as seen in the Pauline letters and prophetic writings (DDC 4.6.9-4.7.21). Yet, he does not praise eloquence itself; rather he prefers a concrete proclamation than a showing off of <b>rhetorical</b> <b>technique</b> (DDC 4.7.14-15).
