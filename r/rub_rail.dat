5000|$|... 2001 {{saw another}} color variation, with the hull {{remaining}} black while the top deck, hood, and seat became silver. The <b>rub</b> <b>rail,</b> pivots, and boarding handling were yellow, and the instrument pod and handle pole cover were black.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, {{colors were}} the main changes for the XP Limited, as the hull deck were changed to black; the seat and hood were silver; and the cowling, handle pole cover, pivot, {{boarding}} handle, <b>rub</b> <b>rail,</b> and graphics were yellow.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Limited" [...] tag {{was dropped}} from 2003 and 2004 XPs and DI, for direct {{injection}}, was added. Orbital {{direct fuel injection}} {{was added to the}} 951 cc engine for improved fuel economy, performance, and emissions. The XP DIs were given a whole new color scheme: red hull, deck, cowling, and handle pole cover; black hood, pivots, <b>rub</b> <b>rail,</b> and boarding handle; and a silver seat.|$|E
50|$|The Manza Club Class {{comes with}} a {{contrast}} coloured roof. It has alloy wheels and chrome inserts in hood, bumper <b>rub</b> <b>rails</b> and door <b>rub</b> <b>rails.</b>|$|R

50|$|Since its 1980 introduction, {{the body}} of the Minotour has seen {{relatively}} few changes. During the 1990s, a floor-level <b>rub</b> <b>rail</b> was added. In the early 2000s, the front bodywork above the roof was modified to improve body aerodynamics. In 2008, the taillights were updated (to share a similar design with the Thomas Saf-T-Liner C2 and Thomas Saf-T-Liner HDX). Following various chassis redesigns, the window forward of the entry door has grown in size.|$|E
5000|$|Non-virgin vinyl is {{only used}} to make black or grey {{extruded}} products. Vinyl that has been recycled from old straps that have not sold because a color was discontinued or from used straps that {{have been removed from}} old furniture are ground up into small bits and melted. Then, black colorant is added and the solution is reformed into screen spline, <b>rub</b> <b>rail</b> and other non furniture straps products. This process eliminates the features of original virgin vinyl.|$|E
50|$|For 1995, the XP now sported the new X-4 hull {{which was}} based on race hulls used the {{previous}} year. The hull was extended at the rear, narrowed at the bow, and trim strips were added {{on both sides of the}} stern. This hull handled far superior to the previous hulls. It had removable trim tabs at the rear which could be shimmed with a kit offered over the counter to trim the hull as desired. Also, a 4 inch long pump spacer was added in front of the pump. While this spacer added slightly to the top speed, it hurt performance in rough water because of the extra time it took to fill the increased volume with water once the pump came unhooked. The engine's displacement was again increased, now to 720cc, rated at 85 horsepower. The 95s used the same upper deck as 94s, aside of some color and graphic changes. The graphics theme moved from green and red to yellow and purple, with the hull seat, intake grills, cowling and handle pole cover becoming yellow, while the grips, boarding handle, <b>rub</b> <b>rail</b> and traction mats moved to purple. The deck remained white.|$|E

50|$|Later on, {{numerous}} {{options were}} available making the boats essentially semi-custom. For example, in 1985 the options list included {{a choice of}} interior wood, counter material, cabin floor, exterior <b>rubbing</b> <b>rails,</b> higher/deeper toe rails, teak swim ladder, a choice of engines, instrumentation options, and so on. Bristols were typically built more heavily than many comparable production sailboats, with features such as skeg-hung rudders, keel-stepped masts, fully encapsulated keel ballast, interior cabinetry bonded to the hull for strength, heavy-duty bronze seacocks, and heavy fibreglass lay-up. Most Bristols can be raced using the PHRF handicap system, despite being designed more for cruising and comfort.|$|R

5000|$|The {{uppermost}} continuous strake {{along the}} topsides {{is called the}} sheer strake. In old vessels, a rubbing strake was built in just below a carvel sheer strake. It was much less broad but thicker than other strakes so that it projected and took any rubbing against piers or other boats when the boat was in use. In clinker boats, the rubbing strake {{was applied to the}} outside of the sheer strake. The strakes adjacent to the garboard are referred to accordingly as the first broad and second broad. Each strake thereafter has its own special name such as bottom strakes, lowers, bilge strakes, topside strakes, and uppers. Many current pleasure craft reflect this history by providing the boat with a mechanically attached (and therefore replaceable) <b>rub</b> <b>rail</b> at the location formerly occupied by a rubbing strake, often doubling to cover the joint between a GRP hull and its innerliner.A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or is necessary due to a tuck in the shape. It is commonly employed in carvel and iron/steel shipbuilding, but there are very few, possibly only one type of, clinker craft that use them."A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or is necessary due to a tuck in the shape." [...] This statement represents a mis-understanding of what a [...] "stealer" [...] is tasked with accomplishing as a hull is lined-off. After determining the widths of strakes amidships (there are three categories), a quantity can be determined for all these strakes. This quantity is then divided into the height of the stem to determine the width of the average hood-end. This width must be twice the hood-ends thickness or it {{will not be able to}} carry its fasteners. If the hood-ends are not wide enough, the quantity is dropped by one until the resulting revised width is strong enough to carry its fasteners. Stealer is actually a misspelling of the word steeler, the plankers borrowed this word from their peers in the foundry, where forgers would strengthen a piece of metal by steeling a different metal to the original piece. This was analogous to strengthening the hood-end by making it wider, providing more wood mass around each hood-end. Wider meant fewer hood-ends. A device was needed to compensate for the drop in strakes that actually reached the stem. The device was a strake that was stooped short of the stem by burying its forward butt end into a notch chiseled into a through plank. This strake was called a steeler by the plankers and a drop plank by the liners who originated it by counting strakes during the lining off process.|$|E
5000|$|For 2011, Blue Bird {{made several}} detail {{changes to the}} Vision. On the outside, the {{exterior}} design of the <b>rub</b> <b>rails</b> was changed slightly. To increase parts commonality with the All American, the Vision was given the instrument cluster and steering column introduced with the newly redesigned All American D3. The propane-fuel Vision saw major changes related to its powertrain. Following the discontinuation of the GM 8.1L V8 in 2010, Blue Bird began a partnership with both Ford Motor Company and ROUSH CleanTech. [...] The end result of the partnership was the propane Vision equipped with a 362 hp Ford 6.8L V10 and Ford 6-speed automatic transmission.|$|R

5000|$|The ideal equitation mount {{has less}} bascule than the show hunter, {{because it is}} easier for a rider to {{maintain}} the correct jumping position on a [...] "flatter" [...] horse that does not throw the rider out of the saddle when it jumps. However, a show jumper is not ideal either, as the horse may be less smooth in its way of going and too excitable in temper for the rider to maintain steady and correct form over a course. The horse must jump safely and not carelessly <b>rub</b> <b>rails.</b> The movement of the equitation horse is generally more collected than the show hunter, which allows the rider to better adjust the stride for tricky combinations.|$|R
50|$|It is an {{upgraded}} version of Sumo Grande. The Grande MK II seeks to deliver added value to customers through substantial {{changes in the}} exteriors and interiors combined with improvements in drivability, ride and handling and comfort.The exteriors have been accentuated by a new chrome lined grill, side <b>rub</b> <b>rails</b> with chrome inserts and indicators on ORVMs. The interiors have been refreshed to give the vehicle a completely new, contemporary look with a two tone theme complemented by a new faux wood centre console and new fabric upholstery.The changed drive ratio in the Grande MK II gives a boost to low speed performance in city driving conditions. While a modified suspension ensures a comfortable ride, particularly for second and third row occupants, optimised anti-roll bars reduce body roll to a minimum during cornering. The NVH levels have been further refined.|$|R
5000|$|Coelan Marine Coatings come in {{transparent}} gloss {{and silk}} finish with the primer coming in pigmented colors. They {{can be used}} on wood, fiberglass, and metal deck surfaces. They are also used to restore inflatable dinghies, boating fenders, and <b>rub</b> <b>rails.</b> Once applied, it is both flexible and resilient and able to bridge hair line cracks and stop leaks. [...] Colean Marine Coatings are water vapor permeable so they allow moisture to dissipate and are resistant to high wear and abrasion. They are used to refurbish wood such as teak, oak, mahogany and red ironwood but can also be used for softwoods such as pine, fir, larch, and spruce. They can also be used on many other surfaces including steel, fiberglass, and rubber. Colean Marine Coatings are designed to be ‚Äúantislip‚Äù and are also often used on home furnishings as well as boats. Coelan Marine Coatings are rated {{among the best in the}} industry as they retain a good level of gloss and translucency.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike the {{subjective}} scoring of the hunters, show jumping horses are more objectively penalized by accumulating [...] "faults" [...] if they knock down or refuse obstacles (four faults), {{or if they}} exceed the optimum time. Some jumper classes also require a second round for those who jumped clean (received no penalties) in the first round. These [...] "jump-offs" [...] are judged on accuracy and time. Competitors are placed first {{in the order of}} fewest faults and then in the order of fastest time (not just time allowed). Because style is never taken into account, the horse may jump in unorthodox form, take off from a poor spot, or <b>rub</b> a <b>rail</b> without any penalty. This objective scoring makes show jumping easy to follow though sometimes both horses and riders may exhibit unorthodox and even unsafe form without penalty.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} part of {{an extended}} laboratory study on the potential to apply the acoustic emission (AE) technique for in-situ rail-wheel interaction monitoring using rail-mounted sensors. The essential monitoring principle is that {{the intensity of the}} rail?wheel contact will affect the intensity of the AE that is generated during rolling. The current paper is confined to situations of 'normal' rolling, investigating the effects of wheel load, speed and lateral rattling of the generated AE, although the wider study includes the effects of rail and wheel irregularities on the AE generated. Rail-wheel contact was simulated on a scaled test rig consisting of a single wheel rolled round a circular track using a motor mounted at the centre of the track attached to a driving arm. AE was recorded at a fixed point on the track while the wheel was rolled around the track at a range of speeds with varying axle load. Wheel slip was found to be insignificant and tests using a simulated source confirmed that the energy recorded with a source at a given position on the track was repeatable. In one set of experiments, measures were taken to eliminate lateral rattling of the wheel and eccentricity of the wheel arc relative to the track arc. In a second set of experiments, some lateral float of the wheel along the axle was allowed and a limited amount of eccentricity was built into the track. The energy per wheel rotation for normal rolling was found to increase in a linear fashion with increasing axle load and centrifugal force, as would be expected due to the increasing rolling resistance with axle load and increasing lateral force with angular speed. The frictional instability associated with the lateral rattling was clearly detectible at low axle loads and lower speeds, and both natural and eccentricity (flange <b>rubbing)</b> <b>rail</b> abnormalities were detectible in the AE record. It is concluded that, with appropriate calibration, contact stresses between wheel and rail on straight or curved track can be monitored using track-mounted sensors so that cumulative contact stress can potentially be monitored...|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} built with 16 equally spaced {{turnouts}} {{each with a}} water pump and timber shed. A maintenance station responsible for perhaps eight miles (13 km) of track was based at each turnout. The station overseer surveyed half of that track daily, and effected minor repairs such as making secure loose bars of iron, punching down protruding spikeheads, chamfering wheel flange <b>rubs</b> off the <b>rails,</b> ramming earth around the piles, and so on. The overseer was also responsible for maintaining adequate supplies of water and timber at the station, and for calling on the Superintending Engineer for nonroutine derangements.|$|R
5000|$|Equitation {{and show}} hunters are judged subjectively based on ability and form (of the rider) and elegance, cadence and style (of the horse). Equitation may be judged in one round, though often a [...] "work-off" [...] is {{included}} in which the top riders return for further testing that might consist of another round of jumping, flatwork, no stirrup work, or switching horses, for example. Hunter courses are generally judged in one round, but classics often include two rounds for the top competitors. In most horse shows, four over-fence rounds (one often containing a 25% conformation component) and one flat class make up each hunter section. The judge decides which combination has the smoothest round and displayed a ride most closely to the ideal. Certain mistakes like refusals will lead to drastic penalties, while minor errors like a soft <b>rub</b> on a <b>rail</b> are slightly penalized, at the judge's discretion. This can make judging difficult to follow for those new to showing until the subtle factors considered by the judge are better understood.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{places in}} North America, length is {{commonly}} 48 feet or 53 feet, and width is either 96 or 102 inches (including <b>rub</b> <b>rails</b> and stake pockets on the sides, which generally placed every 2 feet). Some older trailers still in service are only 45 feet or shorter if used in sets of doubles or triples (often used to haul hay). Various lengths and combination setups {{can only be}} legally driven on turnpike/toll roads which are far too long for most roadways. Body and frame {{can be one of}} 3 general designs: the heaviest and sturdiest is all steel (usually with wood planks), Ever popular combo with steel frame and aluminium bed, these type often have wood portions for nailing down dunnage boards), and aluminium (which is the lightest allowing for more cargo to be legally carried without overweight permits). Incredibly light and very expensive to purchase, all aluminium trailers are very slippery when wet, flex more and are easily damaged. They also have a natural upwards bend so that when loaded they straighten out to be more flat, rather than to sag in the middle under a load. Another popular type of flatbed trailer is a stepdeck (or drop deck) with approximately 2 feet lower deck and low profile wheels to accommodate taller loads, without hitting low bridges or tunnels. These stepdecks can come with loading ramps to allow vehicles to roll on and off of the back from ground level. Shorter trailers used for local jobs such as landscaping and building material delivery within urban or local areas can have a [...] "hitchhiker" [...] type forklift truck attached to the back in order for driver alone to deliver and unload pallet/skid items. A bulkhead or [...] "headache rack" [...] is sometimes be attached to the front of either a straight or a stepdeck trailer for load securement {{at the front of the}} deck. In the event of long pipes or steel or lumber coming loose in a hard braking incident, they save the operator and cab/sleeper in one of two manners in theory. If attached to the trailer they bend while attempting to block forward motion of a loosened cargo, causing the long load to go above the cab and driver. If attached to the frame behind the cab or sleeper of the tractor, in theory they protect the back of the cab from impact and if unable to stop the load coming thru the cab, they cause the cab to be knocked off of.the frame, rather than impale the cab and kill or seriously injure the driver.48 and 53 ft lengths usually have two axles spread out to over 10 ft apart at the rear [...] "California spread" [...] in order to allow for more weight distribution on the rear of the deck (40,000 lb instead of 34,000 for a tandem axles design). So-called Cali spread was originally designed to comply with bridge weight formulas in that state but has since been adopted in most other parts of the country. These spread axles take far wider turning radius, and if turning the combination tractor/trailer too sharply, the front axle tires of the trailer may damage the road/parking lot surface, or pop a tire bead off of the rim, or both. Some trailers have the capability of lifting or lowering the front axle independently to mitigate this risk, however driver may not be able to use this feature if the trailer is loaded, but if the deck is empty the driver can lower the front axle to bring the rear axle off of the ground to significantly decrease turning radius of the rig for easy manoeuvre in tight spaces, or to reduce tire wear during empty /deadhead miles of travel. Under the deck of the trailer can be attached racks for spare tires, dunnage boards, or tire chains...as well as various tool/storage boxes. On one side (or often both sides for alternating pull on strap tension) are usually sliding (but sometimes fixed) winches to ratchet down 4 inch straps for load securement. On most 48 foot trailers, you may not place these strap/winches over a tire as when air pressure releases out of the suspension system when parked, the deck lowers down and will likely pop a trailer tire. Some trailers have an air scale which when the driver learns how to interpret properly through experience, combined with his knowledge of how much his/her rig weighs when empty and can interpret how much cargo can safely and legally be loaded onto the trailer. With different varying loads of cargo, driver can have an idea how much his gross total weight is (and if he is legal to avoid ticket) (80,000 without a permit in most states, but slightly lower in others). Some decks have pop up chain systems which have a higher WLL (working load limit) than attaching chains to either the stake pocket/spools, or the frame. Other decks of trailers can have sliding detachable accessories which greatly diversify your options of where and how to place a chain hook for securement. Besides axles which raise/lower as needed, some spread axle trailers can slide one or both axles forward, or back to create a tandem setup in specific situations when necessary, to comply with weight distribution requirements. Although certain amounts of front and rear cargo overhang is allowed (as well as overhang to one or both sides of the trailer) with flags/banners/flashing lights to warn drivers behind and to the side of you of impending danger of impalement if they follow too close behind you and you should have to suddenly stop...in extreme cases permit loads require escort be led front rear or both for oversize/over dimension cargo/equipment.|$|R
6000|$|At last {{he would}} lock up the desk with the {{decision}} of unshaken confidence, jump and go out. He would walk swiftly {{back and forth on}} that part of the foredeck which was kept clear of the lumber and of the bodies of the native passengers. They were a great nuisance, but they were also a source of profit that could not be disdained. He needed every penny of profit the Sofala could make. Little enough it was, in all conscience! The incertitude of chance gave him no concern, since he had somehow arrived at the conviction that, in the course of years, every number was bound to have his winning turn. It was simply a matter of time and of taking as many tickets as he could afford for every drawing. He generally took rather more; all the earnings of the ship went that way, and also the wages he allowed himself as chief engineer. It was the wages he paid to others that he begrudged with a reasoned {{and at the same time}} a passionate regret. He scowled at the lascars with their deck brooms, at the quartermasters <b>rubbing</b> the brass <b>rails</b> with greasy rags; he was eager to shake his fist and roar abuse in bad Malay at the poor carpenter--a timid, sickly, opium-fuddled Chinaman, in loose blue drawers for all costume, who invariably dropped his tools and fled below, with streaming tail and shaking all over, before the fury of that [...] "devil." [...] But it was when he raised up his eyes to the bridge where one of these sailor frauds was always planted by law in charge of his ship that he felt almost dizzy with rage. He abominated them all; it was an old feud, from the time he first went to sea, an unlicked cub with a great opinion of himself, in the engine-room. The slights that had been put upon him. The persecutions he had suffered at the hands of skippers--of absolute nobodies in a steamship after all. And now that he had risen to be a shipowner they were still a plague to him: he had absolutely to pay away precious money to the conceited useless loafers:--As if a fully qualified engineer--who was the owner as well--were not fit to be trusted with the whole charge of a ship. Well! he made it pretty warm for them; but it was a poor consolation. He had come in time to hate the ship too for the repairs she required, for the coal-bills he had to pay, for the poor beggarly freights she earned. He would clench his hand as he walked and hit the rail a sudden blow, viciously, as though she could be made to feel pain. And yet he could not do without er; he needed her; he must hang on to her tooth and nail to keep his head above water till the expected flood of fortune came sweeping up and landed him safely on the high shore of his ambition.|$|R
