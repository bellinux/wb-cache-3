40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{possibility}} for a full mud return, top hole drilling system, applying a concentric dual drill string and an integrated pump. Top holes are usually drilled without mud return, leaving the cuttings on the sea floor. Sea water with barite and other additives are employed as drilling fluid and is released to the sea when used. By employing a dual drill string and a down hole pump to lift the return to top side facilities, full return is enabled. This facilitates the use of high performance mud, which have several advantages, including primary well control before the BOP is set, improved hole stability, elimination of a pilot hole to check for shallow gas influx and extended top hole sections. Possible solutions to obtain a complete and functioning new system have been analyzed. Based on existing technology and its current limitations, two alternative systems are developed on a conceptual level. The first system includes one integrated <b>return</b> <b>pump,</b> the second employs multiple integrated return pumps. The design base case is set to 1000 meter water depth and 500 meter deep well, of which 100 meter is drilled with a 36 ” drill bit, and 400 meter is drilled with a 26 ” drill bit. This base case covers most of the top holes drilled on the Norwegian sector. System pressure estimates are presented, and a mud level regulation solution is developed and analyzed. The mud level regulation system allows the mud level in the well to be controlled to keep the well balanced and stabilized, and to prevent mud discharges to sea floor. The level regulation solution is theoretically proved, and enables reliable regulation of the mud level in the well based on existing technology. Predictions of the system behavior are made, and {{the limitations of the}} systems are presented. The developed systems drilling capacities are analyzed and found not capable of fulfilling the base case requirements, due to the limitations of the selected dual drill pipe. The low flow rate of the pipe limits the ROP, due to high cutting generation with large drill bit diameters. The hydraulic horsepowers at the drill bit nozzles are also too low, due to the lowered available pressure drop, low flow rate, and large drill bit. However, the available pressure drop at the drill bit nozzles are estimated to over 80 bar. It is recommended to employ a larger dual drill pipe, with increased pressure capacity. Then the drilling capacity of the system would be comparable to other full return top hole drilling systems. The systems impact on cost and drilling parameters are discussed and found to be comparable with other innovative solutions for full return top hole drilling. There are uncertainties of both developed systems. The uncertainties regarding the system employing only one <b>return</b> <b>pump</b> concerns the design limitations of the chosen <b>return</b> <b>pump</b> type, a progressive cavity pump. The uncertainties regarding the multiple <b>return</b> <b>pump</b> system, concerns the system behavior with several return pumps distributed throughout the drill string. A full return top hole drilling system employing a concentric dual drill string and an integrated pump is found feasible. But due to existing technology limitations, a mud motor is chosen to power the <b>return</b> <b>pump,</b> this demands a drill pipe with a higher capacity than what exists today, to obtain comparable drilling capacity to other top hole drilling systems. The development of an electric conducting dual drill pipe would expand the possibilities much further, and improve the overall drilling capacity of the system...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA novel Reverse Flow Baffled Reactor (RFBR) was {{constructed}} to achieve aerobic granulation in continuous-flow process {{in order to}} treat the high quantity of influent wastewater. Municipal wastewater was fed to a 120 L reactor and successfully produced aerobic granules revealing a sludge volume index (SVI) of 33 mL/g. Aerobic granules possessed higher extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) content than seed sludge. The protein/polysaccharide (PN/PS) ratio in the EPS {{was determined to be}} about 10 : 1. Bacterial community analysis revealed that most of the species (Bacteroidetes, Nitrospira and Proteobacteria) found in the seed sludge were preserved in the reactor, except Pedobacter species that was washed out from the reactor. Moreover, different bacterial species were identified in RFBR and SBR (sequencing batch reactor) granules due to different process and operational parameters. Presence of Fe, Ca, Al, Si and P in wastewater were aggregated in granules (acted as a core) and enhanced the granulation.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} in which the stirrer speed was varied during a methanol synthesis run with BASF S 3 - 86 catalyst showed that mass transfer limitations were present at 750 psig reactor pressure and at space velocities of 5000 and 10000 sl/kg(cat.) -hr [...] There was no effect of stirrer speed on reaction rate at 2500 psig reactor pressure and 16500 sl/kg(cat.) -hr. space velocity. However, this was probably due to a close approach to equilibrium {{rather than to the}} lack of a mass transfer effect. The most plausible explanation for the presence of a mass transfer influence is the position of the gas feed dip tube relative to the agitator impeller. A second set of stirrer speed experiments using the same catalyst showed that feeding into the reactor headspace produced much lower reaction rates, compared with gas feed through a dip tube. The headspace feed also showed a strong dependence on stirrer speed, consistent with the dip tube feed results. In a ``blank` run at 375 {degree}C with decahydronaphthalene, about 110 mL of the initial charge of 150 mL remained in the reactor after 73 hours of operation at 375 {degree}C and 850 psig of hydrogen.

Submerged aeration is critical to optimal fish growth, and cannot be eliminated despite surface aeration’s low energy appeal. Baseline water quality parameter values of DO > 3 mg/L, pH > 5. 5, and TAN > 3 mg/L (2 mg/L average) were established for the pilot study configuration and hydraulic retention time (HRT). A plant/tilapia ratio of 2. 5 ft[superscript] 2 /lb was identified for the proposed facility’s design. The simplified design was assessed compatible with concrete block construction local to northern Uganda. Incorporating the following culturally familiar elements will facilitate technology adoption: utilize native fish (tilapia) and vegetable crops identified in community markets, replace commercially produced plant tank raft components with woven matting from locally available natural materials, and identify the unfamiliar proposed tank design with newly adopted raceway culture techniques at a well-known Ugandan national fishery institute. A proposed facility preliminary design represents local materials, identified plant/tilapia ratio, minimum HRT, and simplified design components for tilapia densities ranging from 12 to 3 gal/lb.

These equations are discretized using a finite difference method based on an upwind scheme. A specific model for the interconnection cells is also proposed.
