40|$|OBJECTIVES—Reactive joint {{complications}} {{triggered by}} salmonella gastroenteritis are increasingly reported, but the outcome {{and long term}} prognosis of the patients is incompletely known. This study looked at the prognosis of salmonella arthritis in patients hospitalised in 1970 - 1986.  METHODS—Hospital records from two hospitals in southern Finland were screened for patients with the discharge diagnosis of salmonellosis or <b>reactive,</b> postinfectious <b>arthritis</b> or Reiter's disease. For the patients with confirmed diagnosis of <b>reactive</b> salmonella <b>arthritis,</b> data about the acute disease were collected from the hospital records. A follow up study was performed.  RESULTS—There were 63  patients (28  women, 35  men, mean age 36. 5  years) with salmonella arthritis. Urethritis occurred in 27 %, eye inflammation in 13 %, and low back pain in 44 % of the patients. HLA-B 27 was present in 88 %. More men than women were HLA-B 27 positive. HLA-B 27 positive patients had higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mean 80. 9  v 46. 5  mm 1 st h, p =  0. 0180). Also, extra-articular features and radiological sacroiliitis were seen only in HLA-B 27 positive patients. A follow up study was performed on 50  patients mean 11. 0  (range 5 - 22 years) later. Twenty patients had recovered completely. Ten patients had mild joint symptoms, 11  patients had had a new acute transient arthritis, and five acute iritis. Eight patients had developed chronic spondyloarthropathy. Radiological sacroiliitis was seen in six of 44  patients, more frequently in male than in female patients (32 % v 0 %; p =  0. 0289). Recurrent or chronic arthritis, iritis or radiological sacroiliitis developed only in HLA-B 27 positive patients.  CONCLUSION—Joint symptoms are common after <b>reactive</b> salmonella <b>arthritis.</b> HLA-B 27 contributes to the severity of acute disease and to the late prognosis. ...|$|R

Repetitive cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation associated with changes in synovial perfusion are postulated to activate hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α and nuclear factor-κB, two key transcription factors that are regulated by changes in cellular oxygenation and cytokine stimulation, and that in turn orchestrate the expression of a spectrum of genes critical to the persistence of synovitis.

40|$|G protein-coupled {{receptor}} kinase (GRK) 2 plays {{a crucial role}} in regulating the extent of desensitization and resensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We have shown that the expression level of GRK 2 in lymphocytes decreases during inflammatory diseases such as <b>arthritis.</b> <b>Reactive</b> oxygen species {{play an important role in}} a variety of inflammatory conditions, including arthritis. We demonstrate herein that oxidative stress, induced by exposure of lymphocytes to H 2 O 2, results in a 50 % reduction in GRK 2 protein levels and GRK activity with no changes in mRNA expression. Treatment of lymphocytes with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein partially reverses the effect of H 2 O 2 on GRK 2 levels, although we did not detect direct tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK 2. Inhibition of the nonproteasomal protease calpain by calpeptin can prevent the H 2 O 2 -induced GRK 2 decrease. In vitro experiments confirm that GRK 2 is partially digested by m-calpain in a calcium-dependent way. Functionally, H 2 O 2 -induced decrease in GRK 2 levels is associated with an similar to 70 % decrease in agonist-induced beta(2) -adrenergic receptor sequestration. We describe oxidative stress as a novel mechanism for regulation of the intracellular level of GRK 2 during inflammatory processes. Moreover, our data demonstrate that oxidative stress may change the functioning of GPCRs via calpain-dependent regulation of GRK 2 levels...|$|R
40|$|Eosinophils {{are seldom}} noted in {{inflammatory}} synovial fluids but {{are reported to}} infiltrate the synovial tissue in inflammatory arthritides. To elucidate a possible role for eosinophils in inflammatory joint reactions the concentrations of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) [...] a specific granule protein from eosinophils [...] were measured by radioimmunoassay in 90 synovial fluids from patients with various inflammatory arthritides (rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> <b>reactive</b> and crystal arthritides, Reiter's disease and psoriatic arthropathy). In the same specimens lactoferrin was measured {{as an indicator of}} neutrophil-involved inflammation. In comparison with the normal circulating levels of ECP and lactoferrin the measured synovial fluid concentrations of both proteins were considerably raised in all patient groups with inflammatory joint diseases in contrast to patients with non-inflammatory arthritides. There was a striking positive correlation between the ECP and lactoferrin synovial fluid concentrations. These data indicate that eosinophil activation is prominent in inflammatory joint reactions and is linked to the activation of neutrophils. The regulation of degranulation or secretion by eosinophils is unknown. Our in-vitro studies showed that peripheral blood isolated neutrophils as well as eosinophils degranulated when exposed to IgG complexes. However, eosinophil degranulation was modest compared with neutrophil degranulation. These data suggest that neutrophil phagocytosis of, for example, immune complexes may be one major mechanism in neutrophil degranulation but that other factors determine the appearance of eosinophil products in inflammatory synovial effusions. The possible modulatory or harmful role of eosinophils in inflammatory joint disease can at present only be speculated on...|$|R

40|$|SAF- 1, a {{zinc finger}} {{transcription}} factor, is activated {{by a number}} of inflammatory agents, including interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) and IL- 6. It is involved in the cytokine-mediated transcriptional induction of serum amyloid A, an acute-phase plasma protein that is associated with the pathogenesis of <b>reactive</b> amyloidosis, rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> and atherosclerosis. Here, we show that the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway regulates cytokine-mediated induction of the DNA-binding activity and transactivation potential of SAF- 1. Phosphorylation of endogenous SAF- 1 in response to IL- 1 and IL- 6 was markedly inhibited by the addition of MAP kinase inhibitors. Consistent with this finding, we show that a consensus MAP kinase phosphorylation site, PPTP, within SAF- 1 could be phosphorylated by MAP kinase in vitro. To analyze the contribution of MAP kinase in the activation of SAF- 1, we prepared two independent mutant proteins in which the threonine residue of the PPTP motif was altered to either valine or alanine. These mutant proteins lost the ability to be phosphorylated by MAP kinase both in vivo and in vitro and exhibited a significantly reduced ability to promote expression of the SAF- 1 -regulated promoter. While the DNA-binding activity of wild-type SAF- 1 protein was markedly increased upon phosphorylation with MAP kinase, no such increase could be detected with the mutant SAF- 1 proteins. Further analysis with the GAL- 4 reporter system showed that mutation of the MAP kinase phosphorylation site considerably lowers the transactivation potential of SAF- 1. Together, these results show that activation of SAF- 1 in response to IL- 1 and - 6 is mediated via MAP kinase-regulated phosphorylation...|$|R
40|$|Serum amyloid A (SAA), a {{plasma protein}} {{inducible}} {{in response to}} many inflammatory conditions, {{is associated with the}} pathogenesis of several diseases including <b>reactive</b> amyloidosis, rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> and atherosclerosis. We have previously reported an element of the SAA promoter, designated SAA-activating sequence (SAS), that is involved in the inflammation-induced SAA expression, and a nuclear factor, SAS-binding factor (SAF), that interacts with the SAS element has been identified previously (A. Ray and B. K. Ray, Mol. Cell. Biol. 16 : 1584 – 1594, 1996). To evaluate how SAF is involved in SAA promoter activation, we have investigated structural features and functional characteristics of this transcription factor. Our studies indicate that SAF belongs to a family of transcription factors characterized by the presence of multiple zinc finger motifs of the Cys 2 -His 2 type at the carboxyl end. Of the three cloned SAF cDNAs (SAF- 1, SAF- 5, and SAF- 8), SAF- 1 isoform showed a high degree of homology to MAZ/ZF 87 /Pur- 1 protein while SAF- 5 and SAF- 8 isoforms are unique and are related to SAF- 1 /MAZ/ZF 87 /Pur- 1 at the zinc finger domains but different elsewhere. Although structurally distinct, all members are capable of activating SAS element-mediated expression and display virtually identical sequence specificities. However, varying levels of expression of members of this gene family were observed in different tissues. Functional activity of SAF is regulated by a posttranslational event as SAF DNA-binding and transactivation abilities are increased by a protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, and inhibited by a protein kinase inhibitor, H 7. Consistent with this observation, increased DNA binding of the cloned SAF and its hyperphosphorylation, in response to okadaic acid treatment of the transfected cells, were observed. Taken together, our results suggest that, in addition to tissue-specific expression, SAFs, a family of zinc finger transcription factors, undergo a modification by a posttranslational event that confers their SAA promoter-binding activity and transactivation potential...|$|R
