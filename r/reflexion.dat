50|$|The ideal fiber pattern {{exhibits}} 4-quadrant symmetry. In {{the ideal}} pattern the fiber axis {{is called the}} meridian, the perpendicular direction is called equator. In case of fiber symmetry, many more <b>reflexions</b> than in single-crystal diffraction {{show up in the}} 2D pattern. In fiber patterns these <b>reflexions</b> clearly appear arranged along lines (layer lines) running almost parallel to the equator. Thus, in fiber diffraction the layer line concept of crystallography becomes palpable. Bent layer lines indicate that the pattern must be straightened. <b>Reflexions</b> are labelled by the Miller index hkl, i.e. 3 digits. <b>Reflexions</b> on the i-th layer line share l=i. <b>Reflexions</b> on the meridian are 00l-reflexions. In crystallography artificial fiber diffraction patterns are generated by rotating a single crystal about an axis (rotating crystal method).|$|R

He perpetuated a <b>reflexion</b> initiated by Paul Klee and Edgar Varèse on the transposition of musical structures into formal constructions. He created plant architectures which come close to site-specific art, environmental sculpture and generative art.|$|E

This form of pollution is named polarized light pollution (PLP). Unnatural polarized light sources can trigger maladaptive behaviors in polarization-sensitive taxa and alter ecological interactions.|$|E
25|$|Repington (whom Wilson {{thought a}} “dirty brute” and “lying brute”) {{attacked}} the current standards of British staff officers in The Times on 27 September 1910, arguing that Wilson had educated staff officers to be “sucking Napoleons” and that Robertson was a “first rate man” who would sort it out. Wilson wrote to Lord Loch (27 September 1910) “we can comfort ourselves with the <b>reflexion</b> {{that to be}} abused by Repington is the highest praise an honest man can get”.|$|E

25|$|The typical {{weapon of}} a West Slavic foot soldier was an axe of a {{specific}} shape, so called bradatica. Spears were universally used by both infantry and cavalry. The weapons associated with a nomadic (Avar) culture like sabres, <b>reflexion</b> bows and specific types of spears are missing. On the other hand, a military equipment became more influenced by western types and new types of weapons like double-edged swords (rare before the 9th century) became popular. Archers, unlike the previous period, were already a part of infantry.|$|E
