40|$|The default-mode network (DMN), which {{comprises}} medial frontal, {{temporal and}} parietal regions, {{is part of}} the brain’s intrinsic organization. The serotonergic (5 -HT) neurotransmitter system projects to DMN regions from midbrain efferents, and manipulation of this system could thus reveal insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of DMN functioning. Here, we investigate intrinsic functional connectivity of the DMN as a function of activity of the serotonergic system, through the administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram. We quantified DMN functional connectivity using an approach based on dual-regression. Specifically, we decomposed group data of a subset of the functional time series using spatial independent component analysis, and projected the group spatial modes to the same and an independent resting state time series of individual participants. We found no effects of escitalopram on global functional connectivity of the DMN at the map-level; that is, escitalopram did not alter the global functional architecture of the DMN. However, we found that escitalopram decreased DMN <b>regional</b> pairwise <b>connectivity,</b> which included anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampal complex and lateral parietal regions. Further, <b>regional</b> DMN <b>connectivity</b> covaried with alertness ratings across participants. Our findings show that escitalopram altered intrinsic <b>regional</b> DMN <b>connectivity,</b> which suggests that the serotonergic system {{plays an important role in}} DMN connectivity and its contribution to cognition.

40|$|It {{is widely}} agreed {{that much of}} Asia's rise {{over the past two}} decades has been built around the regions {{increasing}} connectivity. Far less attention has been given, however, to the implications of new mobility flows on the millions of people throughout Asia who remain, for the most part, bound to place. With a focus on Laos, a land-locked and 'least developed' country that has until recently remained largely isolated from transnational flows, this paper considers how growing <b>regional</b> <b>connectivity's</b> are reconfiguring, and in some cases destroying, local communities. In examining this problem two key issues are addressed. First is the concern that Laos is becoming a 'corridor country' or a space of 'non-places' to be passed through, but not to dwell. Second is the widespread displacement and resettlement of local communities that is occurring in the country's urban nodes as a result of processes of 'development' and modernization. As infrastructure upgrades continue to bring new forms of transnational exchange into Laos, people's homes are being destroyed and local communities are being broken apart by resettlement programs that show little consideration to the social and cultural relationships, the sense of belonging, or the affinity to particular landscapes that make up a sense of 'home'. Place is being reconfigured by space, the fixed is becoming increasingly fluid, and those not able to move along regional networks are finding themselves increasingly marginalized in order to make way for connectivity. In the wake of these transformations it is important to consider if there is a place for being 'at home' in a space of flows, networks and nodes and who is it that such landscapes of connectivity benefit and disadvantage...|$|R

However, we address {{the need for a}} within-group model that identifies patterns of <b>regional</b> functional <b>connectivity</b> that exhibit sustained activity across graduated changes in task parameters. For example, predictions of sustained connectivity are commonplace in studies of cognition that involve a series of tasks over which task difficulty increases (Baddeley, 2003). We designed ordinal trend analysis (OrT) to identify activation patterns that increase monotonically in their expression as the experimental task parameter increases, while the correlative relationships between brain regions remain constant. Of specific interest are patterns that express positive ordinal trends on a subject-by-subject basis. A unique feature of OrT is that it recovers information about functional connectivity based solely on experimental design variables. In particular, there is no requirement by OrT to provide either a quantitative model of the uncertain relationship between functional brain circuitry and subject variables (e. g., task performance and IQ) or partial information about the regions that are functionally connected. In this letter, we provide a step-by-step recipe of the computations performed in the new OrT analysis, including a description of the inferential statistical methods applied. Second, we describe applications of OrT to an event-related fMRI study of verbal working memory and H 2 15 O-PET study of visuomotor learning. In sum, OrT has potential applications to not only studies of young adults and their cognitive abilities, but also studies of normal aging and neurological and psychiatric disease...|$|R

Species pools in forest (forest and preforest species) and in grassland (bog plants, pioneers, helophytes) were quite different. In both landscapes, a gradient from plants typical of basic high-productive soils to plants typical of acid low-productive soils reflects a shared successional gradient. The accumulation of organic matter allowed the establishment of Sphagnum spp., which slowly acidified the soil and thus acted as ecosystem engineers for the arrival of bog plants. Moreover, the species composition was additionally driven by the plant light tolerance in forests and by the plant water requirements in grasslands. Mechanisms of species accumulation (increase in species richness) were different in forests and in grasslands: respectively related to the plant light tolerance and to the wetland area. At the regional level, the averaged soil productivity was negatively related to the richness in rare species. Indeed, perennial highly-competitive plants such as Glyceria spp., Iris pseudacorus or Urtica dioica impeded the establishment of smaller and rarer species. At the habitat level, isolated closed depressions (due to either low connectivity or low grazing pressure) have more habitat rare species, giving evidences of dispersal limitation in plant assemblages of closed depressions...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{quantification}} of parasite movements {{can provide}} valuable information for control strategy planning across all transmission intensities. Mobile parasite carrying individuals can instigate transmission in receptive areas, spread drug resistant strains {{and reduce the}} effectiveness of control strategies. The identification of mobile demographic groups, their routes of travel and how these movements connect differing transmission zones, potentially enables limited resources for interventions to be efficiently targeted over space, time and populations. METHODS: National population censuses and household surveys provide individual-level migration, travel, and other data relevant for understanding malaria movement patterns. Together with existing spatially referenced malaria data and mathematical models, network analysis techniques were used to quantify the demographics of human and malaria movement patterns in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Movement networks were developed based on connectivity and magnitudes of flow within each country and compared to assess relative differences between regions and demographic groups. Additional malaria-relevant characteristics, such as short-term travel and bed net use, were also examined. RESULTS: Patterns of human and malaria movements varied between demographic groups, within country regions and between countries. Migration rates were highest in 20 - 30 year olds in all three countries, but when accounting for malaria prevalence, movements in the 10 - 20 year age group became more important. Different age and sex groups also exhibited substantial variations {{in terms of the}} most likely sources, sinks and routes of migration and malaria movement, as well as risk factors for infection, such as short-term travel and bed net use. CONCLUSION: Census and survey data, together with spatially referenced malaria data, GIS and network analysis tools, can be valuable for identifying, mapping and quantifying <b>regional</b> <b>connectivities</b> and the mobility of different demographic groups. Demographically-stratified HPM and malaria movement estimates can provide quantitative evidence to inform the design of more efficient intervention and surveillance strategies that are targeted to specific regions and population groups...|$|R
