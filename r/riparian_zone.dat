40|$|We {{review the}} current {{understandings}} of the frequency, spatial distributions, mechanisms, and ecological consequences of fire in <b>riparian</b> <b>zones.</b> <b>Riparian</b> <b>zones</b> are well known for influencing many ecological processes at local to landscape scales, and fire can have an important ecosystem-scale influence on them. <b>Riparian</b> <b>zones</b> differ from surrounding uplands in their biophysical templates, moisture regimes and disturbance regimes; as a consequence the characteristics and effects of fire are different than in adjacent uplands. Fire impacts on <b>riparian</b> <b>zones</b> vary proportionally with the severity and extent of burning in the catchment and are affected by stream size. <b>Riparian</b> <b>zones</b> {{can act as a}} buffer against fire and therefore as a refuge for fire-sensitive species. However, under some circumstances, such as dry pre-fire climatic conditions and the accumulation of dry fuel, riparian areas become corridors for fire movement. Fire incursion into <b>riparian</b> <b>zones</b> creates canopy gaps and drier conditions, which allow subsequent build up of dead wood and establishment of fire adapted species. In concert, this increases fuel loads and the probability of another fire. Secondary effects of riparian fire include altering nutrient fluxes and cycling, increasing sediment loads, and stimulating erosion. We conclude that riparian fires are potentially important in shaping ecological characteristics in many regions, but this is poorly quantified. A better understanding of riparian fire regimes is essential to assess the effects of fire in helping shape the complex ecological characteristics of <b>riparian</b> <b>zones</b> over the longer-term...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies in}} high-latitude {{catchments}} {{have demonstrated the}} importance of near-stream <b>riparian</b> <b>zones</b> as hydrogeochemical hotspots with a substantial influence on stream chemistry. An adequate representation of the spatial variability of riparian-zone processes and characteristics is the key for modeling spatio-temporal variations of stream-water quality. This thesis contributes to current knowledge by refining landscape-analysis techniques to describe <b>riparian</b> <b>zones</b> and by introducing a conceptual framework to quantify solute exports from <b>riparian</b> <b>zones.</b> The utility of the suggested concepts is evaluated based on an extensive set of hydrometric and chemical data comprising measurements of streamflow, groundwater levels, soil-water chemistry and stream chemistry. Standard routines to analyze digital elevation models that are offered by current geographical information systems have been of very limited use for deriving hydrologically meaningful terrain indices for <b>riparian</b> <b>zones.</b> A model-based approach for hydrological landscape analysis is outlined, which, by explicitly simulating groundwater levels, allows better predictions of saturated areas compared to standard routines. Moreover, a novel algorithm is presented for distinguishing between left and right stream sides, which is a fundamental prerequisite for characterizing <b>riparian</b> <b>zones</b> through landscape analysis. The new algorithm was used to derive terrain indices from a high-resolution LiDAR digital elevation model. By combining these terrain indices with detailed hydrogeochemical measurements from a riparian observatory, {{it was possible to}} upscale the measured attributes and to subsequently characterize the variation of total organic-carbon exports from <b>riparian</b> <b>zones</b> in a boreal catchment in Northern Sweden. <b>Riparian</b> <b>zones</b> were recognized as highly heterogeneous landscape elements. Organic-rich <b>riparian</b> <b>zones</b> were found to be hotspots influencing temporal trends in stream-water organic carbon while spatial variations of organic carbon in streams were attributed to the arrangement of organic-poor and organic-rich <b>riparian</b> <b>zones</b> along the streams. These insights were integrated into a parsimonious modeling approach. An analytical solution of the model equations is presented, which provides a physical basis for commonly used power-law streamflow-load relations.

40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>Riparian</b> <b>zones</b> {{occur as}} {{transitional}} areas between aquatic and upland terrestrial habitats.

25|$|As for {{the health}} of the river overall, the dam has of course {{indirectly}} affected it by promoting the growth of cities and farms along it. However, construction of the dam also has had direct consequences to the morphology and vegetation zones along the river. By raising summer flows much higher than their natural average, and moderating the effects of most floods, the post-dam river supplies an even amount of water to the <b>riparian</b> <b>zone</b> each year, and resultantly vegetation has encroached on the river channel. The dam has vastly reduced the amount of sediment in the Sacramento, and the riverbanks now suffer decreased erosion, slowing the growth of meanders and side-channels. Additionally, nearly all the rock and sand used in the mixing of concrete for the dam was dredged from the river downstream of the dam, further depleting its sediment supply.|$|E
25|$|When altered flow regimes have {{impacted}} <b>riparian</b> <b>zone</b> health, re-establishing natural streamflow may be {{the best}} solution to effectively restore riparian ecosystems. The complete removal of dams and flow-altering structures may be required to fully restore historic conditions, but this is not always realistic or feasible. An alternative to dam removal is for periodic flood pulses consistent with historical magnitude and timing to be simulated by releasing large amounts of water at once instead of maintaining more consistent flows throughout the year. This would allow overbank flooding, which is vital for maintaining the health of many riparian ecosystems. However, simply restoring a more natural flow regime also has logistical constraints, as legally appropriated water rights may not include the maintenance of such ecologically important factors. Reductions in groundwater pumping may also help restore riparian ecosystems by reestablishing groundwater levels that favor riparian vegetation; however, this too can be hampered by the fact that groundwater withdrawal regulations do not usually incorporate provisions for riparian protection.|$|E
