Remarkable exceptions, however, do exist. This work investigates the core/periphery pattern in the European Union and carries out a comparative analysis of the development gaps of different groups of regions defined according to the regime of aid obtained by the European Union (objective 1, objective 2, cohesion funds, etc.). Finally, some policy prescriptions are proposed to reduce <b>regional</b> <b>disequilibria</b> in Europe. ...|$|E

A general equilibriwn model was built, nonlinear and dynamic, in which the price mechanism plays an important role. The model is disaggregated in such a way as to permit the analysis of the agricultural sector within the context in which it is inserted. Special attention is given to the effects of urban protection on growth and welfare variables, and stroog emphasis is put on the role played by rural-urban interactions. The simulation of the model shows that tariffs constitute a burden to lite rural sector as lhey benefit urban activities.

40|$|From Introduction. <b>Regional</b> {{economic}} <b>disequilibria</b> {{was viewed}} as both an obstacle to and result of integration (European Commission 1965; European Commission 1962; European Commission 1969). Even within the Treaty of Rome, the Community tried to establish mechanisms to alleviate regional inequality. However, {{it was not until}} 1975 that the main mechanism of regional policy was established as a result of British and Irish enlargement: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). Since then, cohesion policy has become a significant EU expenditure accounting for â‚¬ 347 bn, or 35. 7 % of the total EU budget for 2007 - 13 (European Commission Regional Policy-Info Regio 2012). It has also become a key policy linked to enlargement. The underlying principle of cohesion policy assumes that the market alone cannot solve development problems and therefore government intervention is needed. This notion is in direct contrast to the underlying principle of EU competition policy, which asserts that the free market can solve economic development problems (Meadows, interview by author, 2003). The logic underlying cohesion policy is not only counter to EU competition policy, but also regulatory policies. Unlike other EU policies, cohesion policy is not a sectoral policy, but rather territorial in nature (Leonardi, 2006). Thus at times EU regulatory policy has also unintentionally worked counter to the goals of regional policy, sometimes disadvantaging poorer regions (Dudek, 2005). As the Community has sought to ameliorate regional disparities, it meant that all levels of government: local, regional, national and supranational would need to be involved, however, member states have different territorial governance and European regional development programs have to varying degrees impacted the relationship and policy responsibility of different levels of government (Leonardi, 2006; Bachtler and Michie 1993; Marks, 1993). The very nature of regional development policy has provoked a re-examination of subsidiarity, or which level of government is the lowest and most appropriate level. The discussion of policy formulation and implementation at the lowest level possible also addresses the issue of the democratic deficit. Some argue that the closer government is to the people the more responsive and representative it is. Democracy, however, also implies that public funds are used in a transparent way and for public rather than private good. Yet, as we examine the history and current situation of EU regional funds we find that corruption and misuse still abound. Thus, to understand the history of regional policy it is imperative to look at the major transformations of the policy, how regional policy has impacted subsidiarity and the quality of democracy, become an important instrument of enlargement and contradicted or conflicted with other EU policies...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{geography}} is fundamentally concerned with describing spatial {{variation in the}} economic landscape and explaining the processes through which this geography takes form. Firms are the primary units through which these processes operate. I reinterpret portfolio theory to provide a novel way of explaining and modeling the spatial implications of control structures and organizational decisions within and between firms. In this paper, I argue that each activity of the firm is like an asset with an expected rate of return and a level of risk. Firms implement spatial strategies to manage risk that trade profits for reductions in risk. These strategies encourage geographic switching and perpetuate <b>regional</b> <b>disequilibria</b> in production technology and employment. Risk management {{and the structure of}} control in a production chain explain the geographic distribution of economic activity better than do transaction costs, flexible specialization, or agglomeration economies. ...|$|E
40|$|For carbon-intensive, internationally-traded {{industrial}} goods, {{a unilateral}} {{increase in the}} domestic CO 2 price may result in {{the reduction of the}} domestic production but an increase of imports. In such sectors as electricity, cement or steel, the trade flows result more from short-term <b>regional</b> <b>disequilibria</b> between supply and demand than from international competition. This paper formalizes this empirical observation and characterizes its impact on leakage. Domestic firms invest in home plants under uncertainty; then, as uncertainty unfolds, they may source the home market from their home plants or from imports. We prove {{that there would be no}} leakage in the short-term (without capacity adaptation) but there would be in the long-term (with capacity adaption). Furthermore, the larger the uncertainty the larger the leakage is. We also characterize the impacts of uncertainty on the (short-term and long-term) pass-through rates. In the concluding section we discuss the implications of these results for the evaluation of climate policies...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} Italy's {{stuttering}} progress towards regional autonomy. At the unification of Italy in 1860, a centralised administrative structure was adopted, as prescribed by the Piedmontese Constitution of 1848. Centralisation of political power reached its apogee during the Fascist period. Regionalist sentiment resurfaced strongly after the last war and gained formal expression in the 1948 Republican Constitution, which provided {{for the creation of}} five 'special' and fourteen (later fifteen) 'ordinary' regions. The special regions [...] regions of special linguistic or political sensitivity (Valle d'Aosta, Trentino - Alto Adige, Friuli - Venezia Giulia, Sicily and Sardinia) [...] were established between 1948 and 1963, but delays orchestrated by the Christian Democrat-dominated central government, reluctant to relinquish its power, postponed the establishment of the ordinary regions until the 1970 s, when pressure from the Socialist Party prevailed. The legislative powers of the regions are of three forms: exclusive (available only to the special regions), complementary, and integrative, the order representing progressively diminishing elements of decisionmaking autonomy. Several regions in central Italy have elected Communist regional governments. However, hopes that the regional governments would be instrumental in ending corrupt and inept government and eradicating <b>regional</b> <b>disequilibria,</b> have mostly been misplaced, although some progress has been made, especially in the northern regions, in the fields of administrative reform, social service organisation, and regional economic planning. The principal reason for lack of progress is the continuing central government control over regional government funds. In many regions considerable amounts of unspent funds have accumulated owing to a combination of political stalemate at the regional level and central government veto. Special attention is given in this paper to the relationship between regional autonomy and (1) local government, and (2) regional planning. To conclude, the present state of play represents an uneasy compromise between the two contradictory historical forces of centralism and regionalism, present since unification. Although there has been a significant departure from the rigid centralisation of the past, the retention of most of the important powers by the central government frustrates the ambitions of the regions to really organise their own affairs. ...|$|E
