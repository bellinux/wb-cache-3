The advantage of these machines to tailings densification is by way of providing a means to allow water or process liquor to run off without <b>repulping</b> the profile. This approach subsequently largely negates the impact of rainfall on densification and dewatering. However, the lighter, faster machines are better suited to marginal terrain access, but not densification due to <b>repulping</b> and their limited penetration depth.

40|$|Recovered {{paper is}} the most {{important}} raw material in the world for the production of paper and paperboard (Hoke, 2009). The availability of recycled fibre is coming under pressure from competition for biomass for different uses, such as construction materials, biorefinery applications and the production of energy (Hoke, 2009). As the demand for secondary fibre increases, paper made with wet strength resins are becoming a more important source of fibre. Currently, wet strength paper entering traditional recycled paper mills ends up in the waste stream (Hoke, 2009). So not only is this a lost opportunity, but also a significant processing cost for its removal and disposal. Therefore it will become increasingly necessary to ensure that wet strength products are firstly removed from comingled recycling streams, and then secondly utilised in an economical manner. This investigation used a wet strength product, Coated Carrier Board (CCB) from Amcor Cartonboard Petrie Mill to investigate variables including chemical type, chemical concentration, temperature and pulping time with the aim of studying the process economics using conventional equipment and chemicals. Pulp tests include Canadian Standard Freeness, visual assessment and rejects %wt. Experimentation was completed in three stages, Scoping Laboratory Trials to investigate chemical types, Laboratory Trials to investigate the effects of variables and finally Industrial Pilot Scale Trials to observe real world effects. This study has presented an experimental methodology, investigated the effect of variables, and then considered their economic outcome. Finally, and most importantly it has been demonstrated that {{there is more than one}} way to achieve a desired rejects level. By observing the line of fit for the lowest cost for reject level, these optimum combinations can be selected on their merit on the basis of other operational aspects. Anecdotal evidence of the usable nature of the pulp was gained in industrial pilot scale trials. Use of chemical aids was found to be necessary for <b>repulping</b> CCB to achieve satisfactory rejects levels. Hydrogen peroxide was ineffective at <b>repulping,</b> expensive and hazardous. Hypo produced successful <b>repulping</b> results in tap water, however did not in mill white water, these were therefore eliminated as candidates. Potassium Persulphate used in conjunction with Sodium Hydroxide (Caustic Soda) exhibited a small but positive effect in laboratory trials, however failed to provide a positive effect in industrial pilot scale trials, therefore suggesting it is not an effective additive for CCB <b>repulping.</b> Of the chemical combinations trialled, it was therefore concluded that Caustic Soda was most effective and economical. The experimentation undertaken successfully observed the effects of the selected variables on rejects level. It was observed that time had the greatest and most consistent effect on reducing reject content. In Laboratory trials from 10 mins to 20 mins pulping caused an approximate 75 percent reduction in rejects and this was repeated in Industrial Pilot Scale Trials with thirty to ninety minute trials exhibiting approximately the same reduction. The <b>repulping</b> process was determined to follow first order kinetics with respect to rejects %wt. It was also established that even though the addition of chemicals and increased temperature contributes to increased cost per Accepts Tonne, when aiming for low rejects level these costs are necessary. Increasing pulping time, therefore energy, was found to have the greatest effect and paid for itself up to approximately 550 kWh/Tonne. The variable of second greatest effect was temperature, where an approximately 50 percent reduction of rejects was observed from 45 °C to 75 °C. In the social, economic and environmental climate requiring increasing use of recycled feedstock, it is an important result that <b>repulping</b> wet strength paper is feasible with existing paper mill recycling equipment and commercially available chemicals, and can likely be done below the cost of traditional wastepaper...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Process Engineeering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 1995. The hydrometallurgical {{leaching}} of sulphide concentrates {{was introduced}} in the 1950 's. Generally the leaching mechanisms of these processes are not understood fundamentally. The reasons for this are the inherently complex nature of sulphide chemistry and that the sulphide concentrates usually consist of highly intergrown sulphide minerals. The leaching kinetics of sulphide concentrates where only one metal-sulphide mineral occurs have been investigated intensively, but not for sulphide concentrates with more than one metal-sulphide mineral. The behaviour of these mixed metal-sulphide minerals has mostly been investigated on plant scale to qualitatively determine the leaching trends of the process. The consequence of the relatively unKnown leaching mechanism and kinetics is that these processes are not controlled efficiently. This study was conducted on the acid-oxygen pressure leaching of Ni-Cu matte (the first stage leach process at the Ni-Cu refinery of Impala Platinum Ltd.). As a first step to improve the control efficiency of the process, the process must be stabilised. Therefore, an off line computer simulation program is proposed to control the <b>repulping</b> section of the plant that has previously been controlled solely by an operator. Controlling the <b>repulping</b> section is very important, because conditions exist in the <b>repulping</b> tanks for leaching to occur. This causes perturbations in the pulp entering the pressure leach autoclave. Due to the fast reaction kinetics of the matte in the pressure leach autoclave the perturbations entering the autoclave will influence the performance of the acid-oxygen pressure leach process. The simulation program was tested on the plant and indicated that considerable improvement in the stability of the operation could be achieved. In obtaining {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour of this process, it is essential that key variables and trends are identified. A methodology is proposed to analyse and model this ill-defined and poorly understood process from historical data by v artificial neural networks (ANN), inductive learning by decision trees and statistical techniques. The back propagation neural network, learning vector quantization neural network and the decision trees yielded comparable classification rates between 73 % and 84 %, and could serve as a basis for the adjustment of operating conditions to improve the efficiency of the process. The relative importance of the process variables is determined by a method of sensitivity analysis and together with the statistical mean, the effect of an increase or decrease in the variable on the process is quantified. These results are substantiated by experimental findings. A leaching mechanism for the acid-oxygen pressure leach of Ni-Cu matte is postulated. The leaching sequence of the nickel and copper sulphides is Ni 3 Sr Ni 7 S" NiS-Ni 3 S 4, and CU 2 S-CU 31 SWCU 1. BS-CUS, respectively. Ni 7 Sa and CU 31 S 1 a are intermediate nickel and copper sulphide phases that form during the leaching process. Ni alloy has a galvanic effect on the sulphide minerals which inhibits the overall leaching rate and results in the formation of H 2 S and the intermediate nickel and copper sulphides (Ni 7 Sa and CU 31 S 1 a). A semi-empirical kinetic model was developed based on the chemical reaction rate expressions of the leaching mechanism. This model can accurately simulate the batch leaching process for variations in the oxygen partial pressure, oxygen flowrate, temperature, particle size, initial acid concentration and pulp density. A sensitivity analysis on the model indicated that for a matte with a lower initial Ni alloy content the leaching rate of nickel is much faster...|$|E

40|$|An {{industrial}} research area of high activity {{in recent years}} has been the development of pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) products that do not interfere with the processing of post-consumer waste. The problem of PSA contamination is arguably the most important technical challenge in expanding the use of recycled fiber. The presence of PSAs in recovered paper creates problems that reduce the efficiency of recycling and papermaking operations and diminish product quality. The widespread use of PSAs engineered to avoid these problems, often referred to as environmentally benign PSAs, could greatly increase the commercial viability of utilizing secondary fiber. Much of the research efforts in this area have focused on the development of PSAs that are designed for enhanced removal with cleaning equipment currently utilized by recycling plants. Most removal occurs at the pressure screens with the size and shape of residual contaminants in the process being the primary criteria for their separation. A viable approach for developing environmentally benign PSAs is their reformulation to inhibit fragmentation. The reduction of adhesives to small particles occurs almost exclusively during repulping; a process in which water and mechanical energy are used to swell and reduce paper products to their constituent fiber. Engineering PSA products to promote the formation of larger adhesive particles during <b>repulping</b> will greatly enhance their removal and reduce or eliminate their impact on the recycling process...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{research}} indicates that wax is amenable to removal by froth flotation provided it is free or detached from the fiber. The only effective means, at this time, of maximizing detachment of wax is {{through the use of}} low consistency pulping at temperatures above the melting point of wax. Wax removal from WCC through washing, flotation, or a combination of both was approximately 90 % in these laboratory studies, indicating that not all of the wax is detached from fibers. These results were summarized in Annual Report 1, December 1, 1997 to November 30, 1998. Pilot trials were conducted in which the authors simulated a conventional OCC <b>repulping</b> process with and without flotation. Additional aggressive washing and water clarification were also examined during the study. The inclusion of flotation in the OCC stock preparation system significantly improved the removal of wax spots and extractable material from the furnish. Based on this study, the authors predict that a compact flotation system with 2 lb surfactant/ton of fiber would improve the OCC pulp quality with regard to wax spots by 60 % and would not negatively affect strength properties. Flotation losses would be in the 2 - 5 % range. Two mill trials were conducted during {{the last quarter of the}} project. One trial was carried out at Green Bay Packaging, Green Bay, WI, and a second trial was conducted at Menasha Corporation, Otsego, MI.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Process Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Nickel-Copper {{sulphide}} ores are {{the most}} important Platinum Group Metal bearing ores. The South African deposits are exceptionally rich in the platinum group metals (PGMs) and production of the PGMs is the primary purpose of treating these ores. The methods used in the recovery of the PGMs from the nickel-copper ores generally consists of ore concentration by physical techniques, pyrometallurgical concentration and hydrometallurgical extraction of the base metals followed by the PGMs. Pyrometallurgical concentration produces Ni-Cu matte, which is treated by hydrometallurgical processes to recover the nickel, copper, cobalt and the precious metals. In this study, the leaching behaviour of a Ni–Cu matte in CuSO 4 –H 2 SO 4 solution during the <b>repulping</b> (pre-leach) stage at Impala Platinum Refineries was studied. The <b>repulping</b> stage is basically a non–oxidative atmospheric leach stage, in which nickel, iron and cobalt are partially dissolved, while the copper is precipitated. To understand the nature of the leaching process during this stage of the base metal refining operation, the effects of variations in the key process variables such as temperature, stirring rate, particle size, pulp density, residence time, initial copper and acid concentrations were investigated. The pre-leached matte was then pressure leached to ascertain the effect of process conditions in the pre-leach stage on the subsequent pressure leach stage. It was found that the leaching mechanism entails dissolution of metal alloys out of sulphide minerals with transformation of Ni 3 S 2 to NiS. Aqueous copper precipitates as metallic copper and as chalcocite. The matte is leached by both acid and the cementation process, especially in the early stage when the Cu 2 + ions are present. Galvanic interaction of the sulphide minerals and/or the Ni alloy also enhances the leaching process. The leaching kinetics of Ni was characterized with the shrinking core model and was found to be controlled by diffusion through surface layer. An activation energy of 31 kJ/mol was obtained, which also suggested a diffusion controlled leaching reaction. Atmospheric leaching tests indicated that Ni extraction increased slightly in the temperature range 50 – 60 oC, however no significant increase was observed from 60 to 80 oC, probably because the leaching process was found to be diffusion controlled. The slight increase in nickel dissolution at higher temperatures (> 60 oC) may be attributed to the transformation of Ni 3 S 2 to NiS, which is easier to leach. Co extraction appeared to be insensitive to temperature changes, while Fe extraction was low at 50 oC but increased significantly at 60 – 80 oC. The Ni extraction increased gradually with increase in the stirring rate from 145 to 400 rpm while Co and Fe extractions were insensitive at 145 and 205 rpm, but increased substantially at 400 rpm. This was probably due to increased mass transfer rate and transformation of Ni 3 S 2 to NiS. With pulp density, Ni and Co extractions appeared to be insensitive to changes in the pulp density as only a slight increase in extractions was observed when the density was reduced from 1. 7 kg/L to 1. 6 kg/L. Similar iron extractions were achieved at 1. 7 and 1. 75 kg/L but increased significantly at 1. 6 kg/L. It was found that Ni and Co extractions were not significantly affected by changes in the particle size, probably because metal alloys were liberated and hence exposed to the leaching solution. Iron extraction could not be determined accurately because of iron precipitation at pH above 3. Generally the leaching of metals did not depend on the initial copper concentration in the investigated range of 25 - 48 g/L Cu. It was also observed that initial acid concentration did not have an effect on Ni extraction, probably {{due to the fact that}} most of the nickel was leached by the process of cementation. However, Co and Fe extractions increased when the acid increased from 90 g/L to 110 g/L, but no further increase was noted at 125 g/L. A residence time of 5 hours was found to be adequate as there was no significant increase in metal extractions when the residence time was increased beyond 5 hours. As much as 20 % Ni, 40 % Co and 80 % Fe can be extracted from the Ni-Cu matte during the <b>repulping</b> stage of the leaching process studied, provided the investigated conditions prevail. Generally the rate of Cu cementation increased with increasing temperature and pulp density, but decreased with an increase in particle size, acid and copper concentrations. The rate of stirring did not affected Cu cementation. It was found that aqueous copper precipitated from the solution within 90 minutes when the temperature was raised to 80 oC. However, under the present pre-leach temperature of about 60 oC complete Cu cementation can only be achieved after about 5 hours. The cementation reaction was found to follow a mixed control mechanism, with two distinct activation energies namely 18. 2 kJ/mol at 70 – 80 oC and 74. 6 kJ/mol at 50 – 70 oC. This suggested that the rate of cementation reaction is probably controlled by a boundary layer diffusion mechanism at higher temperatures. At low temperatures the rate is probably controlled by a surface reaction mechanism. The pressure leaching experiments, which were aimed at investigating the response of pre-leached matte to the subsequent pressure leaching process, showed that Ni extractions were similar for the investigated pre-leach temperature of 50 – 80 oC and stirring rate of 145 – 400 rpm. For the pre-leach stage conditions of 60 – 80 oC and 205 – 400 rpm Ni 3 S 2 was transformed into NiS, which is easier to leach in the pressure leaching stage. However, because of the aggressive conditions prevailing in the pressure leaching stage, all the nickel minerals were leached at about the same rate. In the case of pulp density, Ni extraction was comparable for all the investigated pulp densities (1. 6 – 1. 75 kg/L). This was probably due to the fact that Ni 3 S 2 transformed to NiS in the pre-leach stage. It was found that Ni extraction increased with increasing residence time for the investigated time of 1 hour to 9 hours, probably due to the changes in the mineral phases of the matte as indicated above. The copper minerals (Cu 2 S and Cu 1. 96 S) transformed into Cu 2 S and Cu 1. 8 S with aqueous copper being precipitated, and were not leached under the applied conditions. All the cobalt and iron dissolved in the pressure leaching stage. A semi-empirical kinetic model was developed for the pre-leaching stage. A comparison of the model predictions and the experimental data for the dissolved species during the batch leaching process showed that the model can satisfactorily fit the trends in the leaching of the metals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to design and {{investigate}} a bio-pulping reactor for rice straw using Bacillus sp. PMB- 021, which was provided by the Disease Management Research Center of the Plant Pathology Department of the National Chung Hsing University, in an attempt to solve the problem of agricultrual wastes and to provide a new source of material of fiber for industries such as pulping and reproductive energy. At first, established the standard for measuring the bio-pulping efficiency of rice straw, including a 24 -hour drying time and the <b>repulping</b> time is 60 seconds, and also obtained the moisture content (dry basis) of the rice straw was 8. 91 %, which harvested from the agriculture experimental station of NCHU. Based on the preliminary studies on bio-pulping of rice straws by Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 at 30, 35 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 ℃, there was no significant difference in basic bio-pulping efficiencies without shaking, while in shaking condition Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 showed the optimal efficiency at 45 ℃ with the recovery of 61. 45 %. Our results thus suggest that Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 requires a shaking condition to obtain a batter efficiency of bio-pulping for rice straw. The bio-pulping reactor in this study was composed of a tank, a stirring apparatus, a power controlling system, a temperature controlling system and other auxiliary devices. The agitation of this reactor adopted the compressing of reciprocating motion. The reciprocating motion angle experiments suggest that the reactor shows disproportionate mixing in 90 ° reciprocating motion by the over-stirring of rice straw, while 45 ° proved to be a better stirring angle of bio-pulping reactor with the recovery of 64. 70 % and the rice straws displayed proportionate mixing and was completely submerged in the reagent. Comparing the results of the experiments with or without Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 under 45 ° reciprocating motion angle process demonstrates that the bio-pulping reactor in this study is able to degrade rice straws efficiently, and that Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 could function in the bio-pulping reactor of this study. The no-stirring experiment of the bio-pulping reactor displayed the natural microorganisms inside rice straws also have the ability of bio-pulping, the potential of which needs to be further investigated in the future. Intermittent bio-pulping process studies demonstrate that the Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 would be hindered from the process without continued stirring. The reaction time of the bio-pulping process should be controlled less than 2 days to prevent hemicellulose lost. The efficiency of bio-pulping can be increased by improving the stirring apparatus and pretreat the rice straw. 摘要 本研究旨在利用國立中興大學植物病理學系病害管理研究室提供之Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 進行稻草生物製漿反應器之開發與探討，以解決稻草廢棄物處理之問題，亦由此方式提供製漿或生殖能源等工業一種新的纖維原料來源。首先本研究確立稻草分解效率判定方式，其包括稻草纖維回收率測定時所需要的乾燥時間為 24 小時，而散漿時間則以 60 秒為佳，並獲致本研究所使用之中興大學北溝農場之風乾梗稻，其乾基含水率為 8. 91 %。 依據Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 進行稻草生物製漿基礎試驗，於 30 、 35 、 40 、 45 、 50 、 55 與 60 ℃之七種不同溫階測試結果，已獲致靜置反應時，菌種添加與否並無顯著效果，然於震盪反應條件下，上述七種溫階則獲致 45 ℃為Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 之較佳反應溫度，其反應回收率為 61. 45 %，並亦獲致Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 於擾動情況下，能有效提高解離稻草纖維之效果。 本研究開發之稻草生物製漿反應器，系統包括反應槽體與攪拌機構、動力與控制系統、溫度控制系統以及其他輔助裝置，其擾動主要採取往復轉動之擠壓方式，在轉動角度之測試結果，獲致於轉動角度 90 °運轉時會造成稻草過度擠壓，導致攪拌不均之情況；當於轉動角度 45 °時，則可獲致較佳之反應現象，稻草可完全浸於反應溶液並達到均勻之攪拌效果，而其反應回收率為 64. 70 %；運轉角度 45 °試驗組與無菌對照組反應試驗結果相互比較，亦獲致Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 能有效於反應器內進行纖維解離。反應器無攪動對照組試驗中亦發現，稻草本身所內含之雜菌亦具有解離纖維之能力，有關其是否具備生物製漿之潛力則需進一步探討。而間歇運轉試驗結果則顯示若無持續擾動，將影響Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 進行稻草生物製漿之能力；且未來有關稻草生物製漿之反應時間應以兩天以內為佳，以考量保留更多之半纖維素成分，然而未來仍須解決攪拌機構容易造成攪拌不均之問題，或是透過適當之稻草前處理，來增進稻草生物製漿之效率。目錄 謝 誌	i 摘要	ii Abstract	iv 目錄	vii 圖目錄	x 表目錄	xiii 第一章 緒論	 1 1 - 1 前言	 1 1 - 2 研究目的	 3 第二章 文獻探討	 4 2 - 1 稻草	 4 2 - 1 - 1 稻的種類	 4 2 - 1 - 2 稻草結構	 5 2 - 1 - 3 稻草成分	 9 2 - 2 纖維	 12 2 - 2 - 1 纖維素	 12 2 - 2 - 2 半纖維素(hemicellulose) 	 15 2 - 2 - 3 木質素(lignin) 	 17 2 - 2 - 4 植物纖維(plant fiber) 	 18 2 - 3 製漿工業	 20 2 - 3 - 1 機械製漿(mechanical pulping) 	 21 2 - 3 - 2 化學製漿(chemical pulping) 	 24 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 	牛皮漿法(kraft process) 	 25 2 - 3 - 2 - 2 	亞硫酸法(sulfite process) 	 25 2 - 3 - 3 生物製漿(bio-pulping) 	 26 2 - 4 散漿與洗漿	 29 2 - 5 反應器	 30 2 - 5 - 1 反應器之操作方式分類	 30 2 - 5 - 2 生物反應器	 32 2 - 5 - 3 固態發酵	 36 第三章 實驗方法與設備	 41 3 - 1 實驗目的與內容	 41 3 - 2 試驗方法	 41 3 - 2 - 1 	稻草切斷處理方式	 42 3 - 2 - 2 	稻草溶液調製方式	 42 3 - 2 - 3 	散漿方式	 43 3 - 2 - 4 	沖洗過篩方式	 43 3 - 2 - 5 	乾燥物乾物秤重方式	 44 3 - 2 - 6 稻草反應回收率	 44 3 - 3 實驗設備與儀器	 45 3 - 3 - 1 量測設備與儀器	 45 3 - 3 - 2 反應器使用之儀器與材料	 52 3 - 4 試驗材料	 56 3 - 4 - 1 稻草	 56 3 - 4 - 2 菌種	 56 3 - 4 - 3 培養液	 57 3 - 5 實驗規劃與實驗流程	 58 3 - 6 稻草分解效率判定方式	 61 3 - 6 - 1 建立散漿時間試驗與結果	 61 3 - 6 - 2 建立沖洗過篩方式	 65 3 - 6 - 3 建立乾燥時間試驗與結果	 66 3 - 7 稻草生物製漿基礎試驗	 69 3 - 7 - 1 Bacillus sp.
