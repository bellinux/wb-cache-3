50|$|Symptoms are {{different}} {{for every person}} {{depending on the type}} of <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> with which the person is infected. Both spirillary and streptobacillary <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> have a few individual symptoms, although most symptoms are shared. Streptobacillosis is most commonly found in the United States and spirillary <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> is generally diagnosed in patients in Africa. Rat-bite symptoms are visually seen in most cases and include inflammation around the open sore. A rash can also spread around the area and appear red or purple. Other symptoms associated with streptobacillary <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> include chills, fever, vomiting, headaches, and muscle aches. Joints can also become painfully swollen and pain can be experienced in the back. Skin irritations such as ulcers or inflammation can develop on the hands and feet. Wounds heal slowly, so symptoms possibly come and go over the course of a few months.|$|E
50|$|When proper {{treatment}} is provided {{for patients with}} <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever,</b> the prognosis is positive. Without treatment, the infection usually resolves on its own, although it may take {{up to a year}} to do so. A particular strain of <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> in the United States can progress and cause serious complications that can be potentially fatal. Before antibiotics were used, many cases resulted in death. If left untreated, streptobacillary <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> can result in infection in the lining of the heart, covering over the spinal cord and brain, or in the lungs.

50|$|The Nitrosomonadales {{are a small}} {{order of}} Proteobacteria. Like all Proteobacteria, they are Gram-negative.

50|$|Rat bite fever {{is caused}} by either Streptobacillus moniliformis or Spirillum minor. The {{incidence}} of <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> is highest in urban areas with poor sanitation where the rat population is high, however in recent times cases have also been attributed to occupational contact with rodents such as pet shop employees or laboratory workers or through pet ownership.|$|E

5000|$|To {{diagnosis}} streptobacillary <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever,</b> {{blood or}} joint fluid is extracted and the organisms living in it are cultured. Diagnosis for spirillary rat bite fever is by direct visualization or culture of spirilla from blood smears or tissue from lesions or lymph nodes. Treatment with antibiotics {{is the same}} for both types of infection. The condition responds to penicillin, and where allergies to it occur, erythromycin or tetracyclines are used.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{associated}} with spirillary <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> include {{issues with the}} lymph nodes, which often swell or become inflamed {{as a reaction to}} the infection. The most common locations of lymph node swelling are in the neck, groin, and underarm. Symptoms generally appear within 2 to 10 days of exposure to the infected animal. It begins with the fever and progresses to the rash on the hands and feet within 2 to 4 days. Rash appears all over the body with this form, but rarely causes joint pain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> is an acute, febrile human illness {{caused by}} {{bacteria}} transmitted by rodents, rats, or mice, in most cases, which is passed from rodent to human by the rodent's urine or mucous secretions. Alternative names for <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> include streptobacillary fever, streptobacillosis, spirillary fever, bogger, and epidemic arthritic erythema. It {{is a rare}} disease spread by infected rodents and {{can be caused by}} two specific types of bacteria. Most cases occur in Japan, but specific strains of the disease are present in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Africa.Some cases are diagnosed after patients were exposed to the urine or bodily secretions of an infected animal. These secretions can come from the mouth, nose, or eyes of the rodent. The majority of cases are due to the animal's bite. It can also be transmitted through food or water contaminated with rat feces or urine. Other animals can be infected with this disease, including weasels, gerbils, and squirrels. Household pets such as dogs or cats exposed to these animals can also carry the disease and infect humans.If a person is bitten by a rodent, it is important to quickly wash and cleanse the wound area thoroughly with antiseptic solution {{to reduce the risk of}} infection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> {{transmitted}} by the Gram-negative coiled rod Spirillum minus (also known as Spirillum minor) is more rare, and is found {{most often in}} Asia. In Japan, the disease is called sodoku. Symptoms do not manifest for two to four weeks after exposure to the organism, and the wound through which it entered exhibits slow healing and marked inflammation. The fever lasts longer and is recurring, for months in some cases. Rectal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms are less severe or are absent. Penicillin {{is the most common}} treatment.|$|E

50|$|The streptobacillosis form of <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> {{is known}} by the {{alternative}} names Haverhill fever and epidemic arthritic erythema. It is a severe disease caused by Streptobacillus moniliformis, transmitted either by rat bite or ingestion of contaminated products (Haverhill fever). After an incubation period of 2-10 days, Haverhill fever begins with high prostrating fevers, rigors (shivering), headache, and polyarthralgia (joint pain). Soon, an exanthem (widespread rash) appears, either maculopapular (flat red with bumps) or petechial (red or purple spots) and arthritis of large joints can be seen. The organism can be cultivated in blood or articular fluid. The disease can be fatal if untreated in 20% of cases due to malignant endocarditis, meningoencephalitis, or septic shock. Treatment is with penicillin, tetracycline, or doxycycline.|$|E
50|$|Ruys {{studied at}} the Gymnasium in Zwolle and then was awarded a bachelor's degree in Utrecht. She pursued a PhD in {{medicine}} at Groningen, graduating on 3 July 1925 after submitting a thesis on the cause of <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever.</b> She was hired by plague specialist Professor J. J. van Loghem {{to work on a}} study of plague in ship- and harbour-rats for the ministry of health (GG and GD). In 1928 she became director of the laboratories of the GG and GD and formed a class on hygiene which she then taught. One of her early discoveries was a large group of women who were being treated for gonorrhea despite actually suffering from the minor infection vulvovaginitis, due to sloppy laboratory tests. Proper diagnosis enabled the women to return to work and avoid the embarrassment and social stigma of a sexually transmitted infection. In 1940 she was promoted by van Loghem to professor of microbiology of infectious diseases in Amsterdam with the speech Ziektekiemen. The next year she spoke at an event celebrating his 25th anniversary as professor and in 1948 she took over his professorship of bacteriology, epidemiology and immunology. During the war years she participated in the artsenverzet (doctors' resistance). After male students were removed forcibly from one of her classes, she refused to teach until she was fired in 1944. In February 1945 she was arrested on suspicion of hiding illegal radio transmitters and was locked in the Oranjehotel until 6 May 1945. After her release she married her long-time lover, the playwright August Defresne on 22 June 1945. He {{had not been able to}} marry her before because his first wife would not grant him a divorce, and after 1934, she could not marry him because she would have to give up her work at the GG and GD due to the Algemeen Rijksambtenaren Reglement (ARAR) law of 1934 that stated a female government employee younger than 45 who married would be honorably discharged on the day of her wedding. Their relationship still needed to remain a secret, because co-habitation was considered the same as marriage under the ARAR.|$|E
40|$|Summarizing {{the results}} that have been cited, we have proved that the blood serum of convalescents from <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> {{contains}} antibodies which are specific against the causative agent of that disease. The serum of <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> was capable of destroying the spirochetes {{not only in the}} hanging drop preparations, but also in the peritoneal cavity of guinea pigs. The guinea pigs employed for Pfeiffer's test always remained well. In the experimentally infected mice receiving intravenously or intraperitoneally serum equalling in quantity the amount of infected blood, the numbers of spirochetes were greatly decreased or they disappeared for a definite period. It is not yet clear how long after recovery from <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> the antibodies are effective in the blood of human beings, and further investigations are needed to elucidate this point. In our experiments we found that serum taken from Case I showed definite spirochetolytic and spirocheticidal properties 11 months after the onset of the disease.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: To {{determine}} the relative prevalence of human infections attributable to Streptobacillus moniliformis in California {{over the past}} 3 decades. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all the data collected was conducted on S. moniliformis cultures identified by the Microbial Diseases Laboratory (MDL) from January 1970 to December 1998. Results: Information on a total of 45 S. moniliformis isolates was analyzed. Overall, 91 % of the isolates were from human sources; 58 % were received since 1990. These strains were divided almost equally between males and females, with 50 % of the isolates from patients 9 years old or younger. In 75 % of the cases of human infections where a diagnosis was given, <b>rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> (RBF) was suspected; 83 % of these suspected cases involved either a known rat bite or exposure to rodents. Conclusions: As crowding becomes an increasing environmental reality, humans are more frequently being exposed to zoonotic diseases {{as a result of}} encounters with “wild” animals. Domesticated animals also are exposed more frequently to wild animals; thus, increasing human exposure to once rare zoonotic illnesses. <b>Rat-bite</b> <b>fever</b> is a disease that seems to be easily recognizable by clinicians, easily identified in the clinical laboratory (if suspected), and successfully treated when the appropriate therapy is administered.
