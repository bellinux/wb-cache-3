50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that people experiencing short-term sleep <b>restrictions,</b> <b>process</b> glucose more slowly than individuals receiving a full 8 hours of sleep, increasing the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. In 2005, a study of over 1400 participants showed that participants who habitually slept few hours {{were more likely to have}} associations with type 2 diabetes. However, because this study was merely correlational, the direction of cause and effect between little sleep and diabetes is uncertain. The authors point to an earlier study which showed that experimental rather than habitual restriction of sleep resulted in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Sleep deprivation can cause insulin resistance in the body, triggering the onset of early diabetes.|$|E

It is {{the set of}} adaptive components {{to be added to}} standard enterprise application. Adaptive navigation support is one of identified components with the aim to help users execute routine activities faster, reduce amount of mistakes and support new users of the system. The paper presents a meta-model, architecture and adaptation algorithm behind the adaptive navigation support. Business process constraints are used to describe business rules and <b>restrictions.</b> <b>Process</b> execution patterns are used to discover characteristics and preferences of individual users. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using simplified sales process simulation in Microsoft Dynamics AX and task management process simulation.

Thus, the number of L3 larvae per mosquito declines as the number of ingested microfilariae increases.

40|$|Lineage-tracing {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} some premigratory neural crest cells generate both sensory (S) and autonomic (A) derivatives, whereas others generate only S derivatives. Whether this lineage heterogeneity reflects random variation in a homogeneous population or an early sensory specification of some premigratory crest cells has not been clear. Using Cre recombinase-based fate mapping, we show that GDF 7, which is exclusively expressed in the roof plate, marks neural crest cells with a 10 -fold higher bias to the sensory lineage than those marked (at the same stage of development) by an inducible Wnt 1 -Cre, which is expressed more broadly in the dorsal neural tube. In vitro, GDF 7 has potent sensory neuron-inducing activity. These data suggest that some premigratory crest cells are deterministically restricted to the S lineage and implicate GDF 7 itself in this <b>restriction</b> <b>process...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} factor TRIM 5 α performs a dual {{role in the}} innate immunity. First, TRIM 5 α has an intrinsic ability to induce the AP- 1 and NFκB pathways and contributes {{to the establishment of}} the LPS-mediated antiviral state. Second, it functions as a restriction factor, blocking early stages of retroviral infection in a capsid-dependent manner. The connections between these two functions of TRIM 5 α are debated. We investigated the conservation, in TRIM 5 orthologues, of the ability to activate the innate immune pathways and analyzed the signification of this function in the context of TRIM 5 - mediated HIV- 1 restriction. We took the advantage that there are seven TRIM 5 orthologues in the mouse, with variable abilities to activate the innate immune signaling, to determine the contribution of this signal activator function to the <b>restriction</b> <b>process.</b> [ [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|This role of MHC {{restriction}} {{was observed}} in {{a study conducted by}} Martinez et. al in HY-TCR transgenic mice. Since HY is a male specific antigen, the developing thymocytes would be expected to undergo degradation in males but not in females. However, both males and females were found to contain TNCs. Furthermore, female mice TNCs were found to contain five times more thymocytes than male mice, and less than 4% of them were apoptotic compared to almost 50% in the male TNCs. Also, almost 90% of all thymocytes extracted from the female TNCs were found to be double positives (CD4+CD8+), whereas no such phenotype was present within the male thymic nurse cells. Thus, since not all thymocytes internalized by TNCs went through apoptotic pathways, this was used to conclude that thymic nurse cells are involved in MHC <b>restriction</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R

40|$|Type I {{restriction}} enzymes use two motors to translocate DNA before {{carrying out}} DNA cleavage. The motor func-tion {{is accomplished by}} amino-acid motifs typical for superfamily 2 helicases, although DNA unwinding is not observed. Using a combination of extensive single-mole-cule magnetic tweezers and stopped-flow bulk measure-ments, we fully characterized the (re) initiation of DNA translocation by EcoR 124 I. We found that the methyltrans-ferase core unit of the enzyme loads the motor subunits onto adjacent DNA {{by allowing them to}} bind and initiate translocation. Termination of translocation occurs owing to dissociation of the motors from the core unit. Reinitiation of translocation requires binding of new mo-tors from solution. The identification and quantification of further initiation steps—ATP binding and extrusion of an initial DNA loop—allowed us to deduce a complete kinetic reinitiation scheme. The dissociation/reassociation of mo-tors during translocation allows dynamic control of the <b>restriction</b> <b>process</b> by the availability of motors. Direct evidence that this control mechanism is relevant in vivo is provided. The EMBO Journal advance online publication, 17 November 2005; doi: 10. 1038 /sj. emboj. 760088...|$|R

40|$|TRIM 5 {{proteins}} {{constitute a}} class of restriction factors that prevent host cell infection by retroviruses from different species. TRIM 5 α restricts retroviral infection early after viral entry, before the generation of viral reverse transcription products. However, the underlying restriction mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we show that during rhesus macaque TRIM 5 α (rhTRIM 5 α) –mediated restriction of HIV- 1 infection, cytoplasmic HIV- 1 viral complexes can associate with concentrations of TRIM 5 α protein termed cytoplasmic bodies. We observe a dynamic interaction between rhTRIM 5 α and cytoplasmic HIV- 1 viral complexes, including the de novo formation of rhTRIM 5 α cytoplasmic body–like structures around viral complexes. We observe that proteasome inhibition allows HIV- 1 to remain stably sequestered into large rhTRIM 5 α cytoplasmic bodies, preventing the clearance of HIV- 1 viral complexes from the cytoplasm and revealing an intermediate in the <b>restriction</b> <b>process.</b> Furthermore, we can measure no loss of capsid protein from viral complexes arrested at this intermediate step in restriction, suggesting that any rhTRIM 5 α-mediated loss of capsid protein requires proteasome activity...|$|R
