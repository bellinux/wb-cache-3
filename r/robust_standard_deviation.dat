40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{robustness}} of Phase I estimators {{for the standard}} deviation control chart. A Phase I estimator should be efficient {{in the absence of}} contaminations and resistant to disturbances. Most of the robust estimators proposed in the literature are robust against either diffuse disturbances, that is, outliers spread over the subgroups, or localized disturbances, which affect an entire subgroup. In this article, we compare various <b>robust</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> estimators and propose an algorithm that is robust against both types of disturbances. The algorithm is intuitive and is the best estimator in terms of overall performance. We also study the effect of using robust estimators from Phase I on Phase II control chart performance.

40|$|Cloud {{detection}} is {{a source}} of significant errors in retrieval of sea surface temperature (SST). We apply a Bayesian cloud detection scheme to 37 years of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Area Coverage (GAC) data, which is an important source of multi-decadal global SST information. The Bayesian scheme calculates a probability of clear-sky for each image pixel, conditional on the satellite observations and prior probablity. We compare the cloud detection performance to the operational Clouds from AVHRR Extended algorithm (CLAVR-x), as a measure of improvement from reduced cloud-related errors. To do this we use sea surface temperature differences between satellite retrievals and in-situ observations from drifting buoys and the Global Tropical Moored Buoy Array (GTMBA). The Bayesian scheme reduces the absolute difference between the mean and median SST biases and reduces the standard deviation of the SST differences by ~ 10 % for both daytime and nighttime retrievals. These reductions are indicative of removing cloud contaminated outliers in the distribution, as these fall only {{on one side of the}} distribution forming a cold tail. At a probability threshold of 0. 9 typically used to determine a binary cloud mask for SST retrieval, the Bayesian mask also reduces the <b>robust</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> by ~ 5 - 10 % during the day, in comparison with the operational cloud mask. This shows an improvement in the central distribution of SST differences for daytime retrievals...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A dual {{response}} surface approach {{consists of two}} responses of a quality characteristic. These two responses are the mean response and the <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> (variance) response, which are estimated from an experimental design after performing a model fitting. The <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> response is usually estimated using the sample <b>standard</b> <b>deviation.</b> The main drawback of this estimator by means of sample <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> {{is that it is}} easily influenced by extreme points. For this case, the fitted model based on the sample <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> may not be accurate. Thus, the use of this approach may not produce the correct compromised setting. In this paper, an estimation of the <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> based on Downton’s estimator in a dual {{response surface}} optimization is proposed. A Downton estimator is a <b>robust</b> estimator of <b>standard</b> <b>deviation.</b> A <b>robust</b> estimator is less affected by extreme points compared to the sample <b>standard</b> <b>deviation.</b> Here, a model based on a robust estimator will give better results.

40|$|The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) {{office of}} National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) now generates a daily 0. 05 ° (∼ 5 km) global {{high-resolution}} satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) analyses on an operational basis. The new analysis combines SST data from U. S., Japanese, and European geostationary infrared imagers, and low-Earth-orbiting infrared (United States and Europe) SST data, {{into a single}} high-resolution 5 -km product. An earlier version produced a 0. 1 ° (∼ 11 km) resolution, a resolution chosen to approximate the Nyquist sampling criterion for the midlatitude Rossby radius (∼ 20 km), {{in order to preserve}} mesoscale oceanographic features such as eddies and frontal meanders. Comparison between the two analyses illustrates that the higher-resolution grid spacing has more success in this regard. The analysis employs a rigorous multiscale optimum interpolation (OI) methodology that approximates the Kalman filter, together with a data-adaptive correlation length scale, to ensure a good balance between detail preservation and noise reduction. The product accuracy verified against globally distributed buoys is ∼ 0. 02 K, with a <b>robust</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of ∼ 0. 25 K. The new analysis has proven a significant success even when compared to other products that purport to have a similar resolution. This analysis forms the basis for other operational environmental products such as coral reef bleaching risk and ocean heat content for tropical cyclone prediction. Forthcoming enhancements include the incorporation of microwave SST products from low-Earth-orbiting platforms [e. g., Global Change Observation Mission for Water- 1 (GCOM-W 1) ] in order to improve the resolution of SST features in areas of persistent cloud and correct for diurnal effects via a turbulence model of upper-ocean heating...|$|E
40|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) {{can be estimated}} from day and night observations of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) by optimal estimation (OE). We show that exploiting the 8. 7 μm channel, {{in addition to the}} “traditional” wavelengths of 10. 8 and 12. 0 μm, improves OE SST retrieval statistics in validation. However, the main benefit is an improvement in the sensitivity of the SST estimate to variability in true SST. In a fair, single-pixel comparison, the 3 -channel OE gives better results than the SST estimation technique presently operational within the Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility. This operational technique is to use SST retrieval coefficients, followed by a bias-correction step informed by radiative transfer simulation. However, the operational technique has an additional “atmospheric correction smoothing”, which improves its noise performance, and hitherto had no analogue within the OE framework. Here, we propose an analogue to atmospheric correction smoothing, based on the expectation that atmospheric total column water vapour has a longer spatial correlation length scale than SST features. The approach extends the observations input to the OE to include the averaged brightness temperatures (BTs) of nearby clear-sky pixels, in addition to the BTs of the pixel for which SST is being retrieved. The retrieved quantities are then the single-pixel SST and the clear-sky total column water vapour averaged over the vicinity of the pixel. This reduces the noise in the retrieved SST significantly. The <b>robust</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of the new OE SST compared to matched drifting buoys becomes 0. 39 K for all data. The smoothed OE gives SST sensitivity of 98 % on average. This means that diurnal temperature variability and ocean frontal gradients are more faithfully estimated, and that the influence of the prior SST used is minimal (2 %). This benefit is not available using traditional atmospheric correction smoothing...|$|E

40|$|Tropane {{alkaloids}} (TAs) are toxins {{found in}} a wide variety of plant species growing in mild climates. The most well-known are Datura, Atropa and Hyoscyamus sp., belonging to the Solanaceae family. The TAs family comprises more than 200 compounds, of which atropine and scopolamine are the most active producing anticholinergic symptoms (e. g. blurred vision, dry mouth, muscle spasms, tachycardia and death) if ingested in toxic quantities. The presence of botanical impurities (e. g. seeds, leaves and roots) has been reported in a variety of tea and herbal blends, stressing the need to control the quality of these products in the EU market. The European Union Reference Laboratory (EURL) for Mycotoxins organised a proficiency test (PT) on the determination of TAs (atropine and scopolamine) in tea and herbal infusions upon request from DG SANTE. The measurand levels were targeted to provide insight on the measurement capabilities of EU Member States' laboratories at concentrations close to the recommended limit of quantification (LOQ) established by the Commission Recommendation 2015 / 976 (preferably below 5 μg/kg and not higher 10 μg/kg). Additionally, the ratio of atropine to scopolamine was kept as native in the plant materials in some samples. Three matrices appropriately processed were provided to the participants: black tea, peppermint leaves and fennel seeds. The concentrations of atropine varied from 8. 3 to 42. 2 μg/kg while those of scopolamine ranged from 1. 5 to 20. 8 μg/kg. The participants were asked to determine atropine and scopolamine in 6 contaminated samples (2 per matrix) and 3 blank materials spiked by them with a TAs solution of unknown concentration. This setup was also aimed to allow a preliminary assessment of the robustness of the EURL-developed method. Thirty-three laboratories from 11 Member States joined the PT, with a very significant participation from Germany. The performance of the laboratories was assessed using z-scores with regard to the assigned values obtained by exact matching double isotope dilution mass spectrometry (EMD-IDMS), in line with the ISO 13528 : 2015. In all cases, the consensus values derived from the participants' data were within the range of the assigned values, considering the respective confidence intervals. On average, eighty-seven percent of the z-scores for atropine and 84 % for scopolamine fell in the acceptable range (|z| ≤ 2). The success rate varied from 83 to 94 % for atropine and from 67 to 94 % for scopolamine, across the distributed matrices and concentration levels. The <b>robust</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> of the reported results for both TAs were in good agreement with the target <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> (22 %).

40|$|A {{collaborative}} {{study on the}} analysis for 15 + 1 EU priority PAHs in edible oils was organised to investigate the state-of-the-art of respective analytical methods. Three spiked vegetable oils, one contaminated native sunflower oil, and one standard solution were investigated in this study. The results of 52 laboratories using either high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection or gas chromatography with mass selective detectors were evaluated by application of robust statistics. About 95 % of the laboratories were able to quantify benzo[a]pyrene together with five other PAHs included in the commonly known list of 16 US-EPA PAHs. About 80 % of the participants quantified in most samples also seven additional PAHs, two of which were benzo[b]fluoranthene and benzo[k]fluoranthene also known from the EPA list. Only about 50 % of the participants quantified cyclopenta[cd]pyrene, benzo[j]fluoranthene, and benzo[c]fluorene. The <b>robust</b> relative <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> of the submitted results without discrimination between the methods applied ranged between 100 % for 5 -methylchrysene in spiked olive oil and 11 % for the same analyte in spiked sunflower oil.

The exercise was organised by the European Union Reference Laboratory for Food Contact Materials (EURL-FCM) to evaluate the enforceability of measures under discussion for the future revision(s) of ceramics Directive 84 / 500 /EEC [1] and the implementation of provisions laid down in the Commission Regulation 10 / 2011 [2] for plastics. National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) requested the EURL-FCM to organise an ILC with the aim to check (i) the analytical abilities of participating laboratories to quantify Cu, Fe, Zn and Sb in a solution of acetic acid 3 % and Ba, Co, Mn, Pb, Cd and Al in a solution of acetic acid 4 %; (ii) to test the laboratories performance {{to carry out the}} migration test on ceramic and glass articles and (iii) to derive precision criteria, including repeatability and reproducibility for the release of elements from tableware. Participation in this ILC was mandatory for the nominated NRLs, and open to Official Control Laboratories (OCLs) and other invited laboratories. A total of 53 participants from 27 countries registered to the exercise. Twenty-nine NRLs from 27 countries participated in this ILC and all of them reported results. Laboratory results were rated using z-score in accordance with ISO 13528 : 2015 [3]. The target <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> for the ILC assessment (σ), for all measurands was calculated based on previous ILC 03 / 04 2014 exercises [4] for spiked solutions and using the <b>robust</b> reproducibility <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> for the migration exercise on tableware. Repeatability and reproducibility <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> for the quantification of elements in acetic acid 3 % and acetic acid 4 % (spiked solutions and leachates) were calculated using robust approaches [3, 5]. The outcome of this exercise was satisfactory. The rate of success was almost always higher than 80 % for all elements in all samples. No difference between the performance of NRLs and OCLs was observed. Since the exercise required the uncertainty estimation, an additional assessment was provided to each laboratory, indicating how reasonable their measurement uncertainty estimation was. lζ-scoresl were systematically higher than z-scores, that underlines the need of an improvement in estimation of the measurement uncertainties.

The paper shows how to modify an efficient memetic algorithm for the CARP to tackle two other problems: a CARP with stochastic demands and a bi-objective CARP {{in which the}} second objective {{is the cost of}} the longest trip or makespan. The two new algorithms are finally combined for the bi-objective case with stochastic demands. The resulting MOGA uses average demands to compute a priori a set of non-dominated solutions that will resist random demand fluctuations on the field. Under mild simplifying assumptions, mathematical expressions are derived for the two objectives (expected total cost and expected makespan), thus avoiding simulation or noising techniques to evaluate chromosomes. The algorithm is evaluated on classical CARP instances, modified to have random demands. The non-dominated solutions obtained are very <b>robust,</b> with null <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> in most cases.
