5|$|The Sejm had mostly {{advisory}} powers, {{although it}} could legislate on some strictly local matters, such as communal self-government and spending of some local taxes. It could opine legal acts {{relevant to the}} Grand Duchy. Its deputies {{had the right to}} file petitions and complaints to the King of Prussia, who could consent or reject (as was often the case) the Sejm proposals. Proposals from and to the King <b>required</b> <b>a</b> two-thirds majority; other proposals <b>required</b> <b>a</b> simple majority.|$|E
5|$|Their roles imposed several design {{limitations}} on the vessels. The vessels were designed to operate in coastal areas, which <b>required</b> <b>a</b> shallow draft {{in order for them}} to be able to enter any port on the Baltic seaboard. They also <b>required</b> <b>a</b> heavy armament, {{in order for them to}} be able to engage any hostile ironclad on equal terms. Because Stosch envisioned only local deployments for the vessels, they had limited coal stowage, as they could easily replenish their supply.|$|E

5|$|Accession to EU <b>required</b> <b>a</b> new law {{compliant}} with the European Firearms Directive, which {{was passed in}} 2002. The law significantly liberalized gun ownership, for example by allowing any legal weapon to be owned for self-defense and legalizing semiautomatic firearms which look like automatic, despite introducing more EU required regulation.|$|E
5|$|Alford spent a {{month with}} the Edmonton Eskimos at {{training}} camp in May 1995. He was released after reinjuring his knee, which <b>required</b> <b>a</b> full season of rehabilitation.

5|$|Changes to DST rules cause {{problems}} in existing computer installations.

Early on, Washbrook pulled Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barnes in the nose in his customary short leg position. Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 to win by 409 runs and take a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a bout of}} {{tuberculosis}} that <b>required</b> <b>a</b> stay in a sanatorium in Switzerland, Szigeti settled in Geneva, where he became Professor of Violin at the local conservatory in 1917.

5|$|Fuses: Documented {{evidence}} suggests that the earliest fuses were first used by the Chinese between the 10th and 12th centuries. After the Chinese had invented gunpowder, they began adapting its explosive properties for use in military technology. By 1044 they were using gunpowder in simple grenades, bombs, and flamethrowers, all of which <b>required</b> <b>a</b> fuse to be lit before being thrown at the enemy.|$|E

5|$|General {{elections}} were again held in Zimbabwe on 30 March 2008. The official results <b>required</b> <b>a</b> runoff between Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader; the MDC challenged these results, claiming widespread election fraud by the Mugabe government.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Mrs. Dow's <b>required</b> <b>a</b> {{physical}} examination for each student, including a doctor's certificate ensuring their heart and lung health.

5|$|In 1935, Johnson was one {{of three}} contenders for the Democratic {{nomination}} for lieutenant governor. In the primary, he received more votes than his opponents, J. E. Wise and B. F.

5|$|In 1978, Lawrence {{purchased}} the Commodore PET 2001 {{and no longer}} needed the university's computer. He rewrote DND as Telengard within eight kilobytes of memory. Due {{to a lack of}} space, he designed the dungeon to be procedurally generated based on the player-character's position so the maps would not have to be stored in memory. Lack of memory was Lawrence's primary design obstacle. Nevertheless, the final version almost completely used 32 kilobytes of memory. It was easily ported to the Apple II+ and TRS-80 platforms due to their similar usage of the 8K BASIC programming language. The later Atari 800 port <b>required</b> <b>a</b> more complicated handling of string variables. The three ports were finished before Avalon Hill saw the game at a gaming convention and licensed it in 1982 as one of its first computer games. The IBM PC port <b>required</b> <b>a</b> rewrite into the C programming language; the source code for this version was later lost. The Heath/Zenith CP/M version requires MBASIC. The game's most popular port was for the Commodore 64.|$|E
5|$|In April 1804, President Jefferson {{decided to}} {{reinforce}} Preble's squadron.

They departed in late June and arrived at Gibraltar on 12August.|$|E
