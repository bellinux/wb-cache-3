25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{well-known}} part of Sicilian cuisine is the rich sweet dishes including ice creams and pastries. Cannoli (singular: cannolo), a tube-shaped shell of fried pastry dough filled with a sweet filling usually containing <b>ricotta</b> <b>cheese,</b> is in particular strongly associated with Sicily worldwide. Biancomangiare, biscotti ennesi (cookies native to Enna), braccilatte (a Sicilian version of doughnuts), buccellato, ciarduna, pignoli, bruccellati, sesame seed cookies, a sweet confection with sesame seeds and almonds (torrone in Italy) is cubbaita, frutta martorana, cassata, pignolata, granita, cuccidati (a variety of fig cookie; also known as buccellati) and cuccìa are amongst {{some of the most}} notable sweet dishes.|$|E
2500|$|In early August, {{when the}} village comes alive with expatriates, night-time food feasts (called sagre) are common. One {{of these is}} the sagn' app'zat (literally [...] "sagnas cut into pieces"), which are freshly made, {{slightly}} thick pasta layers sliced into rough [...] squares and eaten with a simple basil-and-tomato sauce, extra-virgin olive oil, and occasionally topped with lumps of <b>ricotta</b> <b>cheese</b> and/or bits of sliced spicy red chillies.|$|E
2500|$|Fresh pastas do not {{expand in}} size after cooking; therefore, [...] of pasta {{are needed to}} serve four people generously. Fresh egg pasta is {{generally}} cut into strands of various widths and thicknesses depending on which pasta is to be made (e.g. fettuccine, pappardelle, and lasagne). It is best served with meat, cheese, or vegetables to create ravioli, tortellini, and cannelloni. Fresh egg pasta {{is well known in}} the Piedmont region and Emilia Romagna region in North Italy. In this area, dough is only made out of egg yolk and flour resulting in a very refined flavour and texture. This pasta is often served simply with butter sauce and thinly sliced truffles that are native to this region. In other areas, such as Apulia fresh pasta can be made without eggs. The only ingredients needed to make the pasta dough are semolina flour and water, which is often shaped into orecchiette or cavatelli. Fresh pasta for cavatelli is also popular in other places including Sicily. However, the dough is prepared differently: it is made of flour and <b>ricotta</b> <b>cheese</b> instead.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ricotta</b> salata <b>cheese</b> is a salted {{variety of}} ricotta {{traditionally}} made in Sardinia (Italy) from the whey remaining after {{the production of}} Pecorino Romano {{protected designation of origin}} or other sheep milk <b>cheeses.</b> <b>Ricotta</b> salata <b>cheese</b> is very critical for the possible growth of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. Sporadic cases of listeriosis associated with <b>ricotta</b> salata <b>cheese</b> have been reported over recent years. The objective {{of the present study was}} to assess the evolution of spoilage and pathogen microorganism of vacuum-packed <b>ricotta</b> salata <b>cheese</b> during the entire product shelf-life. The durability study was conducted on 18 vacuum-packed <b>ricotta</b> salata <b>cheese</b> samples analysed at the beginning of the shelf-life and after 60 and 90 days of refrigerated storage. Pathogens as Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus were never detected. During shelf-life total bacterial counts ranged between 7. 90 ± 0. 64 and 9. 19 ± 0. 58 CFU g- 1 on the rind and between 2. 95 ± 0. 68 and 4. 27 ± 1. 10 CFU g - 1 in the inner paste, while Enterobacteriaceae ranged between 4. 22 ± 0. 66 and 5. 30 ± 0. 73 CFU g - 1 on the rind and 3. 13 ± 1. 80 and 2. 80 ± 0. 88 CFU g - 1 in the inner paste. By considering the technology used, the intrinsic properties and the almost total absence of competing microflora, <b>ricotta</b> salata <b>cheese</b> can support the growth of spoilage and pathogen microorganisms originating from the processing environment. The high level of total bacterial counts and Enterobacteriaceae observed both on the rind and in the inner paste suggests contamination of the product from the processing environment. Therefore, a strict implementation of hygiene during processing is essential in order to reduce the load of environmental contaminants that may grow during refrigerated storage...|$|R

40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{a survey of}} recent studies on native sheep and goat breeds with special {{emphasis}} on their role {{as a tool of}} sustainability. After a short overview, strategies for adding value to the local breeds are described together with a synthesis of measures in support of animal biodiversity in marginal areas of Mediterranean environment. In this direction, three case studies are reported in which the added value of local breeds arising from a typical and/or traditional product is investigated. The first one is on native sheep breeds from Apulian region and the PDO Canestrato Pugliese cheese, and it indicates that Altamurana and Apulian Merino breeds produce milk and cheese having nutritional characteristics and sensory properties distinguishable from non-native breeds. The second and third studies regard local goat breeds and local <b>cheeses,</b> Caciotta and <b>Ricotta</b> <b>cheeses.</b> As it appears from our discussion, Girgentana breed produces milk and Caciotta and <b>Ricotta</b> <b>cheeses</b> with distinguishable fatty acid profile, nutritional index and sensory properties compared to other breeds. These peculiarities add value to the Girgentana breed and therefore give a support in favour of this breed, amplifying its sustainable use. Finally, we point out that the high quantity of sialyloligosaccharides found in local Garganica breed compared to foreign breed appears as an interesting promising feature in the study of adding value to local breeds...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the following objectives: 1) to investigate the survival and growth of Bacillus cereus during the manufacture of Ricotta Salata cheese; and 2) to investigate the survival and growth of Listeria monocytogenes during the manufacture of <b>Ricotta</b> Salata <b>cheese.</b> The <b>Ricotta</b> Salata <b>cheese</b> was made by heating the whole milk to 95 oC, and adding citric acid to coagulate the cheese curd. The cheese curd was inoculated with 7 log 10 CFU/g B. cereus broth and 8 log 10 CFU/g L. monocytogenes broth. After moulding for 12 h, <b>Ricotta</b> Salata <b>cheese</b> was stored at 4 oC for 1 week. During manufacture, the physico-chemical properties [pH, water activity (aw), and Sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration] and bacterial counts were recorded. The pH change fluctuated between 6. 00 to 6. 10 on the surface and 6. 00 to 5. 95 in the centre; the lowest aw was approximately 0. 96 on the surface and 0. 97 in the centre; and the highest NaCl concentration was 3. 3 % on the surface and 3 % in the centre. The survival and growth of the two B. cereus strains (D 1 and ATCC 13061) during the manufacture of <b>Ricotta</b> Salata <b>cheese</b> were similar. The B. cereus grew from approximately 5 log 10 CFU/g to a maximum of 7. 7 log 10 CFU/g of cheese curd during moulding (20 h at room temperature). The survival and growth of the two L. monocytogenes strains (W 1 and ATCC 35152) during the manufacture of <b>Ricotta</b> Salata <b>cheese</b> were similar. The difference between the bacteria count on the surface and in the centre was very small. L. monocytogenes increased from 5 to 6 log 10 CFU/g to a maximum of 8. 6 log 10 CFU/g during manufacture and maintained a level of around 8 log 10 CFU/g in the final product. The Ricotta Salata supported the survival and growth of B. cereus and L. monocytogenes during manufacture. It is important to improve the management of process hygiene for reducing the environmental contamination. Ideally, some lethal treatments should be applied after the packaging of the cheese, to limit the contamination of Ricotta Salata with these two bacteria...|$|R
