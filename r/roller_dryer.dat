Spirulina have many Phytonutrient (Beta-carotene, Chlorophyl, Xanthophyl, Phyocianin, etc) functioned as anti-carcinogen (Tri Panji & Suharyanto, 2001).

Drying with the foam type faster the water {{evaporation}} process in a low temperature that is not destroyed the cell system, so the nutrition value is save (Kumalaningsih, etc, 2005). In general, this research done to compare two drying method, there are: non foam-mat drying method and with foam-mat drying method that show the optimum drying process condition to get the high quality of spirulina drying product and the high efficiency process too.

The result of the research show that the foam-mat drying method give thebetter drying rate compared with non foam-mat drying process. The sample with the foam agent composition (eggwhite) 2, 5 % and the foam stabilizer (metil celulose) 0, 5 % give the highest drying rate compare with the others. Thehighest average rate showed the sample with the thickness 1 mm, which is 0, 632 g H 2 O steamed per second [...] Based onconsideration of product quality and drying process efficiency, drying temperature is relatively good to the applicationof foam-mat drying in spirulina is 60 oC.

30|$|The {{drying process}} of FPH is usually {{accomplished}} by {{a limited number}} of drying apparatus: they are typically spray dryers which provide convectional drying, and vacuum freeze <b>dryers</b> and <b>roller</b> drum <b>dryers</b> which utilize contact heat supply. From the experience, the authors suggest convection spray dryers as the most used drying systems at large scale in FPH production due to a satisfactory productivity, reasonable quality of the final FPH and a relative easiness of operation. The term “spray dryer” is used in this article to describe convectional spray dryers; the authors do not devote the work to spray drying using radiation or mixed heat transfer.|$|R
50|$|Victor Kiam's Remington Products Company {{became very}} profitable, {{branching}} out into other personal care small appliances, buying Clairol's personal care appliance business in 1994. Kiam sold controlling interest in Remington to Ike Perlmutter {{prior to the}} Clairol acquisition that same year. Remington changed hands again on June 1996 when Perlmutter and Kiam sold controlling interest in the company to Vestar Capital Partners. Victor Kiam died in 2001. In 2003, the Kiam family and Vestar sold Remington to the battery company Rayovac. Rayovac {{changed its name to}} Spectrum Brands and markets Remington brand men's and women's electric shavers, hair clippers, beard and moustache trimmers, nose and ear hair trimmers, foot massagers, make-up mirrors, heated hair <b>rollers,</b> blow <b>dryers,</b> and curling irons.

40|$|Promoting food {{security}} in Latin-America and the Caribbean {{is directly related}} to agricultural products. The region faces a food crisis which has reduced large population groups’ access to food. This work contributes to the study of obtaining precooked composite flour made from biofortified crops using protein, vitamin A and/or minerals. This study evaluated the effect of precooked flour’s composition and precooking on its solubility in water, water absorption capacity, consistency and viscosity; such flour was obtained by extrusion and drying on rollers. The composite flours were obtained from cassava roots, sweet potato tubers, corn, rice and bean grains and cassava leaves. Four composite flours were formulated taking four- to six-year-old children’s daily nutrient requirements (protein, iron, zinc and beta-carotenes) as a basis. The extruder was operated at 90 ºC, 300 rpm screw rotation speed, 17. 64 g/min feed flow, with 30 % moisture mixture. The <b>dryer</b> <b>rollers</b> were operated at 4 rpm roller rotation speed, 90 ºC surface temperature and 1 mm separation between rollers. It was determined that flour dried on rollers led to more complete cooking and modified starch granule structure than precooking by extrusion, thereby producing flour having greater solubility in water, less water absorption, higher consistency and smaller viscosity, comparable to that of pattern flour.
