40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} larger amounts of re-newable energy resources, whose power output is inherently unpredictable, {{there is an}} increasing need for frequency control power reserves. Loads are already used to provide <b>replacement</b> <b>reserves,</b> i. e. the slowest kind of reserves, in several power systems. This paper proposes a control scheme for frequency restoration reserves with participation of industrial loads. Fre-quency restoration reserves are required to change their active power within a time frame of tens of seconds to tens of minutes {{in response to a}} regulation signal. Industrial loads in many cases already have the capacity and capability to participate in this service. A mapping of their process constraints to power and energy demand is proposed in order to integrate industrial loads in existing control schemes. The proposed control scheme has been implemented in a 74 -bus test system. Dynamic simulations show that industrial loads can be successfully integrated into the power system as frequency restoration reserves.

30|$|Active power {{reserves}} are always {{needed to keep}} the power system in balance and their amount also depends on the level of wind power penetration into the power system and on forecasted weather conditions. For example, extreme weather conditions may result in a loss of large amount of wind power within a few minutes, thus jeopardizing the reliability and the security of the power system operation [1]. Therefore, {{reserves are}} typically needed for fast conventional generating units to increase the system reliability and ensure the power supply security. According to European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), the type of reserves for keeping the power system in balance can be classified as Frequency Containment Reserves (FCRs), Frequency Restoration Reserves (FRRs) and <b>Replacement</b> <b>Reserves</b> (RRs) [8, 9]. FCRs are activated automatically and locally within 30 s for constant containment of frequency deviations and to constant maintenance of the power balance in the whole synchronously interconnected system. FRRs are typically activated (manually or automatically) within 15 min, {{in order to maintain the}} active power balance in the power system and the power exchange with neighbouring power system on its schedule. RRs respond in several minutes up to hours and restores the FCRs and FRRs back to the required level. The total volume of FCRs in Continental Europe and Nordic region is ± 3000 and ± 600 MW, respectively [9]. However, as wind power impacts the power system operation, it is predicted that more reserves will be needed in the future to accommodate large amount of wind power into the power systems. In this study the power imbalance is controlled through FCRs and FRRs. Conventional and wind power plants provides the FCRs, while FRR is activated only by conventional power plants through AGC.|$|E

40|$|With {{wind power}} {{penetration}} increasing in many systems worldwide, operational issues {{are beginning to}} emerge due to the uncertain nature of wind power.

In this paper a new methodology is proposed for the analysis and provision of system reserve levels.

40|$|Upward {{pressure}} on all mining operations {{is coming from}} the triple bottom line. To some extent this is being offset by the rise in mineral prices but this may or may not continue.

In order to underpin the sustainability of the mining industry it is necessary to continue to reduce cost, reduce the mine environmental footprint whilst increasing community benefit.

40|$|The {{current high}} oil price is {{partly due to}} low {{investments}} in the oil industry the last decade. According to economic theory, exploration and development of new oil and gas fields should respond positively to increasing petroleum prices. But since the late 1990 s, financial analysts have focused strongly on short-term accounting return measures, like RoACE, for benchmarking and valuation of international oil and gas companies. Consequently, the demand for strict capital discipline among oil and gas companies may have reduced their willingness to invest for future reserves and production growth. Thus, we have experienced an unusual combination of high oil prices and low investment levels in exploration and development. In many ways, the oil companies’ focus on RoACE, at the expense of <b>reserve</b> <b>replacement,</b> resembles an implicit co-ordination on low capacity among non-OPEC petroleum producers. This is a partial explanation of the current high oil prices. By examining actual parameters used by the financial markets in pricing of oil companies, we address the issue of whether the low investment outcome could represent a long-term equilibrium. This is hardly likely, as oil companies are made aware that stronger emphasis is put on <b>reserve</b> <b>replacement...</b>|$|R
