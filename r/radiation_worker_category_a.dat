Data are available only on those still serving, i. e., subjects in the age group 20 - 59 yrs., {{and not on the}} retired employees and this is the major constraint in the study. A total of 81 cancer deaths have been recorded in the combined database of 316, 619 Person-Years of which 28 (34. 6 &#x 0025; of the total) deaths belonged to the monitored <b>Radiation</b> <b>Worker</b> <b>category</b> having <b>a</b> database of 112, 363 PY (35. 5 &#x 0025; of the total). Background age-specific cancer death rates of the urban Indian population have been constructed by averaging the only available age-specific cancer mortality data published by the Bombay Cancer Registry for Mumbai, Nagpur and Pune cities. Using this as a tentative "national urban baseline", the estimated Standardised Mortality Ratio for combined DAE employees works out to be 111 with 95 &#x 0025; CI: 80 - 138. The SMR for the <b>Radiation</b> <b>Workers</b> alone is 108 (95 &#x 0025; CI: 72 - 156) as compared to the SMR of 113 (95 &#x 0025; CI: 84 - 149) for the Non-Radiation Workers. The relative risk of <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> as opposed to non <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> is 0. 96 (95 &#x 0025; CI: 0. 64 - 1. 39); analysis on individual types of cancer also leads to similar results. It is seen clearly that the <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> are not at any extra risk of cancer as compared to non-radiation workers. Nor does a comparison with the restricted national base-line data available for cities like Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur indicate any statistically significant risk of cancer in DAE populations...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{workforce}} of the UK Atomic Energy Authority {{has been}} the subject of several previous epidemiological investigations. Aims: To detect and investigate associations between mortality rates and employment in a substantially increased cohort size and follow up extended to 1997. Methods and Results: The new cohort included 51 367 employees, of whom 10 249 were dead. Mortality rates for all workers were low compared to national rates, as were rates in <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> and for workers monitored for internal contamination. For <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> all cause mortality and all cancer mortality were significantly lower than for non-radiation workers. There was no overall trend of increasing mortality with radiation dose. There was little evidence of raised mortality from leukaemia. The association of prostatic cancer with radiation dose was much less significant than in previous reports. However, the relatively high mortality from uterine cancers among <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> remained, though the numbers were very small. The association was with endometrial rather than cervical cancer. Mortality from cancer of the pleura was high among <b>radiation</b> <b>workers,</b> but was not correlated with dose. Conclusion: Overall, <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> at UKAEA showed no excess mortality. The previously detected association of prostate cancer with high radiation dose may have been a statistical artefact or a risk associated with discontinued activities. Endometrial cancer occurred at higher rates in female <b>radiation</b> <b>workers,</b> but, because there was no correlation with dose, may well be due to something other than their radiation exposure. Cancer of the pleura in <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> was almost certainly related to past asbestos exposure. <br/...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe risk of {{exposure}} to increased ionizing radiation from radon was assessed for two groups of people who spend time, either for work (employees serving these visitors, mainly guides) or leisure (members of the public – visitors), in underground tourist facilities: Bear Cave in Kletno, the Gold Mine complex in Złoty Stok and the Underground Educational Tourist Route in the Old Uranium Mine in Kletno. These facilities had been chosen due to their location within the Sudetes, the most radon–prone area in Poland, and because of continuous radon activity concentration measurements conducted there since May 2008 {{to the end of}} January 2012. The selected facilities also meet the criteria for a radiation hazard workplace set by Polish law. The annual limit of the effective ionizing radiation dose allowed for employees in Poland, which is 20 mSv/year, is exceeded for guides working in all the facilities. Also, according to Polish radiological protection regulations, their working conditions qualify them as exposed <b>workers</b> of <b>category</b> <b>A</b> or B. After a month's work, guides receive the annual effective radiation dose allowed for <b>category</b> B <b>workers</b> (> 1 mSv/year) and after a few months – an annual effective radiation dose allowed for people employed in <b>category</b> <b>A</b> conditions (> 6 mSv/year).

40|$|An earlier {{case-control study}} found no {{evidence}} of paternal preconceptional irradiation (PPI) as a cause of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (LNHL). Although fathers of children with LNHL {{were more likely to have}} been <b>radiation</b> <b>workers,</b> the risk was most marked in those with doses below the level of detection. The timing of paternal employment as a <b>radiation</b> <b>worker</b> has now been examined. The previously reported elevated risk of LNHL in the children of male <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> was limited to those whose fathers were still <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> at conception or whose employment also continued until diagnosis.

It was not possible to distinguish between the risks associated with paternal radiation work at conception and at the time of diagnosis. A reanalysis of the original study hypothesis incorporating updated dosimetric information gave similar results to those obtained previously. In particular, the risks of LNHL did not show an association with radiation doses received by the father before conception.

40|$|Background and Objective: Professional <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> are occupationally {{exposed to}} {{long-term}} {{low levels of}} ionizing radiation. Occupational health hazards from radiation exposure, in a large occupational segment of the population, are of special concern. Biological dosimetry can be performed in addition to physical dosimetry {{with the aim of}} individual dose assessment and biological effects. Methods: In this biodosimetry study, some hematological parameters have been examined in 40 exposed and 40 control subjects who were matched by gender, age and occupational records (± 3 years) in Kermanshah hospitals in Iran (2013 - 2014). The occupational radiation dose was measured by personal dosimetry device (film badges). The data was analyzed using SPSS V. 20 and statistical tests such as two-sided Student’s t-test. Results: Exposed subjects had a median exposure of 0. 68 ± 1. 58 mSv/year by film badge dosimetry. <b>Radiation</b> <b>workers</b> with at least a 10 -year record showed lower values of Mean Hemoglobin (Hb) and Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) compared to the control group (p< 0. 05). The mean value of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) in personnel working in Radiology departments seemed to show decrease in comparison with other <b>radiation</b> <b>workers.</b> Conclusion: Although the radiation absorbed doses were below the permissible limits based on the ICRP, this study showed the role of low-level chronic exposure in decreasing Hb and MCV in the blood of <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> with at least 10 years records. Therefore, the findings from the present study suggest that monitoring of hematological parameters of <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> can be useful as biological dosimeter, and also the exposed medical personnel should carefully follow the radiation protection instructions and radiation exposure should be minimized as possible...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to perform {{cytogenetic}} analysis by means of a semi-automated micronucleus-centromere assay in lymphocytes from medical <b>radiation</b> <b>workers.</b> Two groups of workers receiving the highest occupational doses were selected: 10 nuclear medicine technicians and 10 interventional radiologists/cardiologists. Centromere-negative micronucleus (MNCM-) data, obtained from these two groups of medical <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> were compared with those obtained in matched controls. The blood samples of the matched controls were additionally used to construct a 'low-dose' (0 - 100 mGy) MNCM-dose-response curve to evaluate the sensitivity and suitability of the micronucleus-centromere assay as an 'effect' biomarker in medical surveillance programs. The physical dosimetry data of the 3 years preceding the blood sampling, based on single or double dosimetry practices, were collected for the interpretation of the micronucleus data. The in vitro radiation results showed that for small sized groups, semi-automated scoring of MNCM-enables the detection of a dose of 50 mGy. The comparison of MNCM-yields in medical <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> and control individuals showed enhanced MNCM-scores in the medical <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> group (P= 0. 15). The highest MNCM-scores were obtained in the interventional radiologists/cardiologists group, and these scores were significantly higher compared with those obtained from the matched control group (P= 0. 05). The higher MNCM-scores observed in interventional radiologists/cardiologists compared with nuclear medicine technicians were not in agreement with the personal dosimetry records in both groups, which may point to the limitation of 'double dosimetry' procedures used in interventional radiology/cardiology. In conclusion, the data obtained in the present study supports the importance of cytogenetic analysis, in addition to physical dosimetry, as a routine biomonitoring method in medical <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> receiving the highest occupational radiation burdens...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infection}} {{is a global}} public health challenge. Prevalence of current hepatitis B virus infection {{in the general population}} in Uganda is about 10 %. Health care workers (HCW) have an extra risk of getting infected from their workplace and yet they are not routinely vaccinated against HBV infection. This study aimed at estimating prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection and associated risk factors among health care workers in a tertiary hospital in Uganda. Methods Data were obtained from a cross sectional survey conducted in Mulago, a national referral and teaching hospital in Uganda among health care workers in 2003. A proportionate to size random sample was drawn per health care <b>worker</b> <b>category.</b> <b>A</b> structured questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics and risk factors. ELISA was used to test sera for HBsAg, anti-HBs and total anti-HBc. Descriptive and logistic regression models were used for analysis. Results Among the 370 participants, the sero-prevalence of current hepatitis B virus infection was 8. 1 %; while prevalence of life time exposure to hepatitis B virus infection was 48. 1 %. Prevalence of needle stick injuries and exposure to mucous membranes was 67. 8 % and 41. 0 % respectively. Cuts were also common with 31. 7 % of doctors reporting a cut in a period of one year preceding the survey. Consistent use of gloves was reported by 55. 4 % of respondents. The laboratory technicians (18. 0 % of respondents) were the least likely to consistently use gloves. Only 6. 2 % of respondents were vaccinated against hepatitis B virus infection and 48. 9 % were susceptible and could potentially be protected through vaccination. Longer duration in service was associated with a lower risk of current infection (OR = 0. 13; p value = 0. 048). Being a nursing assistant (OR = 17. 78; p value = 0. 007) or a laboratory technician (OR = 12. 23; p value = 0. 009) were associated with a higher risk of current hepatitis B virus infection.
