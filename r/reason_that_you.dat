500|$|The video {{begins with}} Gaga slowly {{appearing}} {{from behind a}} building on a deserted street corner. The whole scenario is bathed in red and violet lights, coming from {{the windows of the}} buildings and alleyways as steam billows out from the drains. When the first verse of the song begins, Gaga emerges from the window of an apartment onto the fire escape. A long take follows, of Gaga strutting through the red-lit district singing the line [...] "I got a <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should take me home tonight", and a shock of black hair falls in her eyes. Gaga does not remove it and the shot spans to her walking backside, gesturing the viewer to follow. The video consists mostly of interchanging shots of Gaga dancing and singing on the street, on the fire escape, and on the steps in front of the apartment building with Clemons. Near the end of the video, after Clemons' saxophone solo, Gaga crouches in front of the building's steps and kisses the sidewalk. The video concludes with a close-up of Gaga's face, before she re-enters through the window into her smokey apartment.|$|E

6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Shorter, {{leaning forward}} again with {{something}} like servile energy, [...] "and now, Mr Swinburne, what about that unhappy man Hawker. I cannot tell what those men meant, or how far {{what they said was}} real. But surely there is danger. I cannot go to the police, for <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> perceive. Among other things, they wouldn't believe me. What is to be done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your real <b>reason</b> is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{feel you}} have no case against the poor lady," [...] said Stanmer. [...] "You admire {{her as much as}} I do." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Because {{you don't}} love him," [...] Bashford resumed with confidence, [...] "is no <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should be unhappy {{just because he}} has {{proposed}} to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{which you}} will not take, being foredoomed for your sins. Still I'll give it honestly. Set the Lady Cicely free, restore her lands, confess your evil doings. Fly the kingdom before Cromwell turns on you and Henry finds you out, taking with you all the gold <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can gather, and bribe the Emperor Charles {{to give you a}} bishopric in Granada or elsewhere--not near Seville, for <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know. So shall you live honoured, and one day, after you have been dead a long while and many things are forgotten, perchance be beatified as Saint Clement of Blossholme." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The <b>reason,</b> Sire, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would thrive," [...] The fool said--"if you'll hear it-- [...] Is {{that of all}} the fools alive [...] Who own you {{for their}} sovereign, I've [...] The most {{forgiving}} spirit." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Fer {{the simple}} <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> fellers wantid ten 'r fifteen dollars an acre fer the bare land, and I hadn't no money fer that kind o' thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll do now, I reckon. It doesn't {{stand to}} <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> feel like moving around very much, therefore, you shall stay here while I go to work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Was it {{for this}} <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> brought about their deaths, Zikali?" [...] I asked, staring him in the face, for I {{felt that he was}} lying to me.|$|E

"And if {{you have}} <b>reason</b> to fear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might not act equitably towards orphans, then marry from among [...] women such as are lawful to you - [...] two, or three, or four: but {{if you have}} <b>reason</b> to fear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{might not be able to}} treat them with equal fairness, then [...] one - or [...] those whom you {{rightfully}} possess.

6000|$|... "Off {{the track}} again!" [...] said Leeson. [...] "Merril has bounced {{a good many}} men out of things, but if I'm to put any money into this venture, I must have a better <b>reason</b> than <b>that</b> <b>you</b> want to get even." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{same idea}} has struck me since we sailed," [...] Vane said. [...] "The {{trouble is that}} until I've decided about the pulp mill he'll have to go unwatched, for the same <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> {{prevented}} <b>you</b> from holding up for me and steaming the plank." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I promised Mark to {{take care}} of you, and for the very <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> love fire, I'd rather not take you into that furnace, lest you never come out again. Let us go back immediately." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, miss, we {{have always}} called her the Medway; {{but there is no}} <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should stick to that name. She has not been {{registered}} yet, so we can call her any name you like." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gadahn then {{warned that}} [...] "your failure to heed our demands {{and the demands}} of <b>reason</b> means <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and your people will — Allah willing — {{experience}} things which will make you forget all about the horrors of September 11th, Afghanistan and Iraq".|$|R

5000|$|... "Accident of Birth" [...] is {{the first}} single from Bruce Dickinson's fourth solo album, Accident of Birth, {{released}} in 1997 and peaking at number 54 in the UK Singles Chart. Dickinson described the song as [...] "about a family from Hell. Except they're in Hell {{and one of them}} has accidentally been born, and they want him back and he doesn't want to go. For all the same <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't {{want to go back to}} your family if they're a pain in the ass, he doesn't want to go back to his family. OK, so they're in Hell, that makes a little difference too." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miller plodded {{along by}} my side {{in silence for a}} few minutes, and then asked, abruptly: [...] "What is the real <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> keep up the fiction of the 'guide' when you don't believe in him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This {{is not a}} step to {{be taken}} against the grain, even for the best earthly motives. Jem! I only beg you to ask advice. For the very <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are irreproachable, you will never have it offered.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After what I have said, {{it is for}} you {{to decide}} whether you think I can be trusted with your secret, for I am sure it is for no slight <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have come to this accursed city." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My impression," [...] he said, [...] "was <b>that</b> both of <b>you</b> disliked {{and feared}} Mr. Fentolin, yet for some <b>reason</b> or other <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were his abject slaves." ...|$|R
6000|$|But this time, in {{the midst}} of his golden sunrise, Newman felt the impulse to grasp at a rosy cloud. [...] "Your only <b>reason</b> is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> love me!" [...] he murmured with an eloquent gesture, and for want of a better reason Madame de Cintre {{reconciled}} herself to this one.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, very fond! Not a word nor a {{look from}} you {{last time you}} came. You must have some <b>reason,</b> though, <b>that</b> brings <b>you</b> here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the same}} <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> adorn your rooms and the dinner-table with flowers," [...] he answered. [...] "One needs them--as a relief. Apart from that, I am {{really proud of}} my dancing-room, and there again, you see, your sex is necessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, of course!' he answered, {{looking up}} from the paper with a smile; 'I meant they were so many. But you do right to be particular. It stands to <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must be particular. Will you allow me to use your pen and ink?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What, Daughter?" [...] {{asked the}} old man in an {{astonished}} voice, [...] "what? Can I believe that you gave all you had to a beggar of the wilderness, and sat still while he devoured it? And is it for this <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> weep?" ...|$|E

3000|$|Suppose now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{live in one}} {{of these}} rooms and want to enter another one. You {{approach}} the guard in your room and ask him to open one of the doors for you, which he is obliged to do. But since these are double doors, you find yourself in front of another door that is still closed. You knock and ask the guard in the other room through the closed door to let you in. You have not elected that guard and there are other doors on which you could have knocked, so he is not obliged to open the door, but he must listen and respond to your request. He asks you to explain why you want to enter his room rather than any of the others. Here is a list of possible <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might give: [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! I {{have touched}} you," [...] laughed the armourer; [...] "come now, {{out with the}} truth. My lad," [...] he added more gravely, [...] "there is no shame in it; <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> I have always {{encouraged}} your wishes to be a soldier, and have done my best to render you as good a one as any who draws sword 'neath the king's banner, and assuredly I would not have taken all these pains with you did I think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were always to wear an iron cap and trail a pike.
