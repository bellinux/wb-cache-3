40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} current {{approach}} to <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> {{in the financial}} sector {{through the lens of}} the history of pay proposals. This history {{can be seen as a}} series of attempts to align interests of financial firms ’ insiders with interests of a varying range of outsiders. Even though interests were getting aligned, excessive risk taking remained, because each proposal overlooked an important group of outsiders. The history offers two lessons relevant for the current debate. First, modern banking involves an important group of outsiders overlooked by the current pay policy – ultimate asset holders. Their interests could be taken into account by separating <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> for commercial and investment banking and by linking pay in investment banking to performance of securities originated, floated and traded. Second, the persistent problem of overlooked outsiders suggests that the very approach to pay in commercial banking should be changed. Instead of searching for an indirect alignment, remuneration could be linked directly to leverage-adjusted profitability of commercial banking operations, making the <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> a tool of countercyclical macro-prudential regulation. The proposed measures could supplement and strengthen the current <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> focusing on the bonus cap and deferred compensation subject to malus and clawback.

40|$|Purpose: The {{legitimacy}} of CEO pay in large U. S. firms has been repeatedly challenged in {{first decade of}} the 21 st century. However, increases in CEO pay have continued to outpace corresponding changes in firm size and performance. This paper studies how large U. S. firms employ remuneration logics to legitimise CEO pay. Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis is used to identify 13 remuneration logics used in the 1998 and 2007 proxy statements from the largest 50 U. S. firms as well as 18 codes of practice issued between 1994 and 2007. Findings: The <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies</b> of U. S. firms have become increasingly homogenous over time.

40|$|In theory, {{for many}} small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises the introduction of performance-related pay might be beneficial: if implemented properly, it could help enterprises in selecting, hiring and motivating the right employees for the right jobs. So far, however, performance-related pay in SMEs has received little academic attention. One of the few studies that examined determinants of performance-related pay amongst SMEs found support for the presence of gender effects; not only regarding the gender of the employees, but also regarding the gender of the entrepreneur. In this paper we have further investigated these� gender effects in <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies.</b> The central idea is that female and male entrepreneurs make different choices regarding their human resource management practices, including <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies.</b> Amongst others, these choices are related to the risk aversion of the entrepreneur {{as well as of the}} employees. Generally speaking, women are more risk averse than men. This may apply to entrepreneurs as well as to employees. This leads to various hypotheses that are tested empirically. Generally speaking, the results provide only limited support for our hypotheses. Our results are fairly consistent with the standard assumption that employees are risk averse (and female employees more than male employees) while employers (entrepreneurs) are not. At the same time, the support for our hypotheses is so limited that we have conducted a critical re-examination of our basic assumptions. This suggests that gender effects in <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies</b> may (also) be caused by gender differences in labour force attachment rather than in risk aversion. � �...|$|R

The key findings were that the retention of key staff and an organisation‘s financial results were primary drivers of changes to remuneration policy; these findings concurred with the 2003 study. However, factors linked to corporate governance, such as Remuneration Committees, Shareholder expectations, Governance/King III have all increased in perceived importance as factors driving changes to <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy.</b> The components of remuneration policies linked to Merit Pay and Retention Strategies appear to have been subject to the most changes since 2003.

40|$|In {{the ever}} so {{increasingly}} competitive business {{climate of the}} 21 st century, human resources are vital for corporate success. Employees need proper incentives to perform in goal-oriented manners. Incentive systems, especially Chief Executive Officer [CEO] remunerations, have been a popular topic since the 1990 s, and this tendency has increased both during the 2002 - 2003 corporate scandal era, {{as well as the}} financial crisis which sparked in 2007. The recent tendency appears to lean towards companies cutting their executive bonuses as well as criticism and suspiciousness towards large bonus payments. While <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies</b> within the banking industry have been thoroughly debated and researched, another financial industry that is left largely untouched are the insurance companies. The focus of this research is therefore CEO remuneration in European insurance companies. This descriptive study, of annual reports of stock-listed insurance companies, uses a purposive cluster sample to explore quantitative trends in CEO remunerations. In addition, a content analysis of five randomly selected companies out of the sample provides a deeper, complementary understanding of the justifications of the trends. The research questions are: What trends on CEO remuneration can be found over the years 2005 - 2009 in annual reports of European insurance companies, concerning total remuneration, fixed salary and short-term bonus? What justifications do companies make for the remunerations over the years 2005 - 2009 ? The quantitative part of the research inductively tests the assumption that CEO remuneration has decreased {{during the past few years}} 2008 and/ or 2009 due to the impact of the financial crisis. The content analysis part of the research deductively tests if agency theory concerns and issues concerning attraction and retention play a role in determining <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies.</b> From this research, it is concluded that short-term variable pay is largely performance-based. Still, many other aspects serve as input factors when determining compensation levels. Based on the content analysis, it is revealed that interest alignment and attraction- and retention-issues are important determinants of remunerations. Subjective factors such as discretionary judgements also play a crucial role. The quantitative trends found in this study show that total remunerations have decreased markedly in 2008, and more vaguely in 2009. The financial crisis has had an impact on especially the short-term variable part of salaries, but also on base salary levels. Although not all companies that were investigated in the content analysis explicitly mention it in their annual reports, over the years 2005 - 2009, all of them become more concerned about <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies</b> and business risk factors. Over the investigated years, these companies also become more attentive to creating proactive and sophisticated value creating <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies</b> that are in line with international standards, in order to act legitimate towards stakeholders...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to gain insight into the {{motivating}} factors that drive employee productivity, and to identify key aspects that could potentially eliminate combative wage negotiations and, consequently, contribute to a more sustainable economy. This research study was exploratory in nature, and a qualitative approach for the collection of data was adopted. A total of 16 skilled blue-collar workers were selected to take part in semi-structured interviews to gain insight into their reality. The research found that clear communication from top management is critically important. <b>Remuneration</b> and <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies</b> are not communicated to all staff, and there are misunderstandings regarding what these are. The workers indicated that the most enjoyable aspect of work, and a key motivator, was training and personal development with specific reference to hard skills. This should be central to a performance management system. The blue-collar workers felt they should be better resourced, and have access to better healthcare, if management expected their productivity to increase. They are more attuned to individual performance, but they will use the collective to benefit themselves.

40|$|In the UK, the top {{executive}} <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> is not geared towards {{the creation of}} value but compensation revisions are rather driven by changes in corporate size, measured by sales growth. This suggests that managing larger firms requires special managerial skills. Even in UK companies with high concentration of control, no significant pay-for-performance relation has been discovered. In Spain, CEOs of larger firms receive higher cash-based compensation than those of small companies. For Spanish listed firms, we find that increases in corporate value are followed by increases in implicit (cash-based) CEO remuneration. However, this positive pay-for-share price performance elasticity is not present in all Spanish corporations: a <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> aiming at the maximisation of corporate value is present in companies {{with a high degree}} of shareholder control. Only strong blockholders seem to be able to impose their share price related compensation scheme upon management. It should be noted that share prices trigger increases in CEO remuneration only if the share price returns are higher than those of the industry peers. In Spanish firms without high control concentration, modifications in managerial remuneration depend upon changes in accounting returns in prior years: if the change in the firm's return on assets (ROA) outperforms the industry ROA, the executive directors' cash compensation increases in the subsequent period. In these companies, the lack of blockholders gives management mor...|$|E
