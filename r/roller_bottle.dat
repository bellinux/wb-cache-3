Thus it is imperative to develop cost effective and scalable process for the production of vaccines so as to make them affordable for mass use. In this study, performance of a novel disposable iCELLis fixed bed bioreactor system was investigated for the production of some viral vaccines like Rabies, Hepatitis-A and Chikungunya vaccines in comparison to conventional systems like the commercially available packed bed system and <b>roller</b> <b>bottle</b> system. Vero and MRC- 5 cell substrates were evaluated for growth parameters in all the three systems maintaining similar seeding density, multiplicity of infection (MOI) and media components. It was observed that Vero cells showed similar growth in all the three bioreactors whereas MRC- 5 cells showed better growth in iCELLis Nano system and <b>roller</b> <b>bottle</b> system. Subsequently, the virus infection and antigen production studies also revealed that for Hepatitis-A and Chikungunya iCELLis Nano bioreactor system was better to the commercial packed bed bioreactor and <b>roller</b> <b>bottle</b> systems. Although for rabies antigen production commercially available packed bed bioreactor system was found to be better.

40|$|The Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} {{triggered}} a complex cascade of microbial responses that reshaped {{the dynamics of}} heterotrophic carbon degradation and the turnover of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in oil contaminated waters. Our results from 21 -day laboratory incubations in rotating glass <b>bottles</b> (<b>roller</b> <b>bottles)</b> demonstrate that microbial dynamics and carbon flux in oil-contaminated surface water sampled near the spill site {{two weeks after the}} onset of the blowout were greatly affected by activities of microbes associated with macroscopic oil aggregates. <b>Roller</b> <b>bottles</b> with oil-amended water showed rapid formation of oil aggregates that were similar in size and appearance compared to oil aggregates observed in surface waters near the spill site. Oil aggregates that formed in <b>roller</b> <b>bottles</b> were densely colonized by heterotrophic bacteria, exhibiting high rates of enzymatic activity (lipase hydrolysis) indicative of oil degradation. Ambient waters surrounding aggregates also showed enhanced microbial activities not directly associated with primary oil-degradation (b-glucosidase; peptidase), as well as a twofold increase in DOC. Concurrent changes in fluorescence properties of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) suggest an increase in oil-derived, aromatic hydrocarbons in the DOC pool. Thus our data indicate that oil aggregates mediate, by two distinct mechanisms, the transfer of hydrocarbons to the deep sea: a microbially-derived flux of oil-derived DOC from sinking oil aggregates into the ambient water column, and rapid sedimentation of the oil aggregates themselves, serving as vehicles for oily particulate matter as well as oil aggregate...|$|R

Stirred-tank cultivations are compared with results obtained from Wave Bioreactors. Transfer from a roller bottle-based production process into large-scale microcarrier culture with starting concentrations of 2 g/L Cytodex 1 microcarriers and 2. 0 x 10 (5) cells/mL was successful. A maximum cell yield of 1. 2 x 10 (6) cells/mL was obtained in stirred-tank microcarrier batch culture while cell numbers in the Wave Bioreactor could not be determined accurately due to the fast sedimentation of microcarriers under non-rocking conditions required for sampling. Detailed off-line analysis was carried out to understand the behaviour of the virus-host cell system in both cultivation systems. Metabolic profiles for glucose, lactate, glutamine, and ammonium showed slight differences for both systems. E-FL cell growth was on the same level in stirred-tank and Wave Bioreactor with a higher volumetric cell yield compared to <b>roller</b> <b>bottles.</b> Propagation of MEV, which can only replicate efficiently in mitotic cells, was characterized in the Wave Bioreactor using a multiple harvest strategy. Maximum virus titres of 10 (6. 6) to 10 (6. 8) TCID(50) /mL were obtained, which corresponds to an increase in virus yield by a factor of about 10 compared to cultivations in <b>roller</b> <b>bottles.</b> As a consequence, a single Wave Bioreactor cultivation of appropriate scale can replace hundreds of <b>roller</b> <b>bottles.</b> Thus, the Wave Bioreactor proved to be a suitable system for large-scale production of an inactivated MEV vaccine. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{ability to}} screen new biomass pretreatments and {{advanced}} enzyme systems at process-relevant conditions {{is key to}} developing economically viable lignocellulosic ethanol. While much research is being invested in developing pretreatment technologies and enzyme systems that will more efficiently convert cellulosic biomass to sugars, the current standard reactor vessel, a shake flask, that is used for screening enzymatic saccharification of cellulosic biomass is inadequate at high-solids conditions. Shake flasks do not provide adequate mixing at high solids conditions. In this work, a <b>roller</b> <b>bottle</b> reactor {{was identified as a}} small-scale high-solids saccharification reaction vessel, and a method was developed for use in screening both pretreated biomass and enzyme systems at process-relevant conditions. This new method addresses mixing issues observed in high-solids saccharifications. In addition, yield calculations from sugar concentrations on a mass basis were used to account for the two-phase nature of the saccharification slurry, which eliminates discontinuities in comparing high-solids to low-solids saccharifications that occur when using concentrations on a volume basis. The <b>roller</b> <b>bottle</b> reactors out-performed the shake flasks by 5 % for an initial insoluble solids loading of 15 % and 140 % for an initial soluble solids loading of 30 %.

As these first experiments were successful, the process was scaled up into a 5 L stirred-tank reactor using 1 g/L Cytodex 1 and a starting cell number of 0, 6 - 1105 cells/mL. After three days of cultivation confluence was reached with cell numbers of 7 - 9105 cells/mL. Using higher carrier concentrations and improved MEM the cell yield could even be increased to 1, 5 - 2106 cells/mL. Alternatively, cultivation of E-FL on Cytodex 1 in a novel wave bioreactor was established. Advantages of this system are low costs and its safety and simplicity in use under GMP restrictions. Cultivations of E-FL in the wave bioreactor were as successful as in stirred-tanks regarding cell numbers, morphology and metabolic activities. Optimal parameters for virus propagation were investigated by parallel cultivation in small scale fermenters (500 mL) using different MOI and starting cell numbers. Based on these results further experiments for virus propagation in stirred-tank-(5 L-scale) and wave bioreactor (1 L-scale) were carried out. Both culture vessels are compared with respect to cell growth and virus yields. We are able to show that both types of bioreactors are suitable for use in MEV vaccine production process. It is expected that slight advantages of stirred tank in cell number are more than balanced by low costs and simple GMP-conform handling of the wave bioreactor...|$|R
30|$|Human diploid cell line, MRC- 5 {{was grown}} onto the {{carriers}} of iCELLis Nano and commercial packed bed bioreactor systems in perfusion mode. Once the cells reached {{a confluence of}} 80 - 90 % by day five, they were infected with Chikungunya virus. Perfusion was started 24 hrs after the batch initiation and the perfusion flow rate for the packed bed system was adjusted according to cell density and was gradually increased during the culture period to maintain the glucose level above ~ 0.1 g/L and the lactate level below ~ 1.5 g/L in the spent media. Cells grown on <b>roller</b> <b>bottles</b> were also infected similarly on day five with Chikungunya virus using the same MOI by batch mode. After infection, three harvests were taken from all the three systems on different days by replenishing with fresh VMM (as per the standard optimized internal production protocol of Chikungunya vaccine). The harvested virus was titrated on Vero cells and the titers of harvests were calculated as plaque forming units/ml (pfu/ml).|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} a novel bioreactor {{system for the}} cultivation of animal, insect, and plant cells using wave agitation induced by a rocking motion. This agitation system provides good nutrient distribution, off-bottom suspension, and excellent oxygen transfer without damaging fluid shear or gas bubbles. Unlike other cell culture systems, such as spinners, hollow-fiber bioreactors, and <b>roller</b> <b>bottles,</b> scale-up is simple, and has been demonstrated up to 100 liters of culture volume. The bioreactor is disposable, and therefore requires no cleaning or sterilization. Additions and sampling are possible {{without the need for}} a laminar flow cabinet. The unit can be placed in an incubator requiring minimal instrumentation. These features dramatically lower the purchase cost, and operating expenses of this laboratory/pilot scale cell cultivation system. Results are presented for various model systems: 1) recombinant NS 0 cells in suspension; 2) adenovirus production using human 293 cells in suspension; 3) Sf 9 insect cell/baculovirus system; and 4) human 293 cells on microcarrier. These examples show the general suitability of the system for cells in suspension, anchorage-dependent culture, and virus production in research and GMP applications...|$|R
