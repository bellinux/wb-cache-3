Otherwise {{identical}} to the S-61L, this version is optimized for overwater operations, particularly oil <b>rig</b> <b>support,</b> by retaining the SH-3's floats. Both the S-61L and S-61N were subsequently updated to Mk II standard with improvements including more powerful CT58-110 engines giving better hot and high performance, vibration damping and other detail refinements.|$|E

50|$|Both Crawford and O'Rahilly admit that, {{while the}} two ships were being fitted out, {{numerous}} acts of mutual sabotage occurred, with each company doing its best to delay the other's launch. The Mi Amigo was first to leave Greenore, but problems with the <b>rigging</b> <b>supporting</b> its antenna mast meant that the ship had to put in at Falmouth for repairs, {{and because of this}} delay Radio Caroline went on air first, on 28 March 1964.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of <b>rigging,</b> <b>supporting</b> the mast {{of a conventional}} fore-and-aft rig limits sail geometry to shapes that are less efficient than the efficient narrow chord of the wingsail. However, conventional sails are simple to adjust for windspeed by reefing. Wingsails typically are a fixed surface area. Conventional sails can be furled easily; some flexible wingsails can be dropped, when not in use; rigid wingsails must be removed when exposure to wind is undesirable.|$|R
50|$|The Spritsail {{is another}} rig with a four-sided fore-aft sail. Unlike the gaff rig where the head hangs from a spar along its edge, this <b>rig</b> <b>supports</b> the leech of the sail {{by means of}} a spar named a sprit. The forward end of the sprit is {{attached}} to the mast but bisects the face of the sail, with the after end of the sprit attaching to the peak and/or the clew of the sail.|$|R

50|$|Diligence {{was built}} by Öresundsvarvet in Landskrona, Sweden and {{launched}} in 1981 as a civilian oil <b>rig</b> <b>support</b> ship. She first served the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) during the Falklands War as a civilian owned ship taken up from the trade (STUFT). As MV Stena Inspector, the ship repaired many British vessels. Stena Inspector was purchased by the Government in 1983 for £25 million from Stena Offshore UK and renamed Diligence. She was sailed to the Clyde Dock Engineering facility, where she was converted and military features added, including a large workshop for hull and machinery repairs, supply facilities, accommodation, armaments and magazines and communications fits.|$|E
50|$|Typhoon Fred {{organized}} from a monsoon trough situated to {{the east}} of the Central Philippines, a depression formed on August 11. The depression moved across northern Luzon Island, upon entering the South China Sea the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fred. Fred reached typhoon intensity on August 14 as the storm moved south of Hong Kong. Typhoon Fred reached peak intensity of 110 mi/h km/h shortly before moving across Hainan Island. Fred then turned to the southwest across the Gulf of Tonkin and made a final landfall in northern Vietnam before dissipating. As Typhoon Fred moved south of Hong Kong the oil <b>rig</b> <b>support</b> barge DB29 sank with 195 people on board; 22 people on board the ship were killed. On Hainan Island heavy flooding and landslides from Fred's rains killed 16 people.|$|E

The helicopter is being designed and manufactured by Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant, JSC, {{with the support of}} the Russian Government.The development of Mi-54 began as part of the Civil Aircraft Development, a federal-oriented programme. It will replace its earlier versions, Mi-2 and Mi-8 helicopters.The project was first unveiled in 1992. The helicopter was showcased at the MAKS-2007 air show. Development is expected to continue for a few more years. Mi-54 is expected to be launched by Rostvertol after 2012.The Mi-54 is expected to enter into service in 2015, however, the aircraft will not gain a domestic airworthiness certification until a year, or 18 months, later.The helicopter can be employed for various applications, including corporate and VIP transportation, offshore, oil <b>rig</b> <b>support,</b> search and rescue operations, medical evacuation missions and border patrol.Cargo capacity and operating costs of Mi-54 ...|$|E
5000|$|The luff of {{the sail}} {{is bound to}} the mast, but unlike the gaff rig where the head is bound to a spar, this <b>rig</b> <b>supports</b> the leech of the sail by means of a {{diagonal}} spar or spars named a sprit. [...] The forward end of the sprit spar is attached to the mast, with the after end of the sprit spar attached to the peak. The sprit is steadied and controlled from the deck by a pair of wire vangs attached to the peak of the sail. It {{is said to be the}} ancestor from which the common gaff rig evolved in 16th-century Holland. The foot of the sail may be bent to a boom, or be loose-footed and just controlled by its sheets.|$|R

5000|$|After {{two and a}} {{half years}} of preparatory {{research}} to determine the wreck’s location, Capt. Bayerle discovered the wreck of the RMS Republic in 1981. [...] He raised investor capital and purchased the assets from a bankrupt Canadian offshore oil <b>rig</b> <b>support</b> company, Wolf Sub-Ocean Ltd., in addition to the purchase of a 285 ft Diving Support Vessel, the Oil Endeavor (renamed the SOSI Inspector) in the years following the find. Martin also married during those years and he and his wife, Susan, gave birth to two children - a daughter, Tessa, and a son, Grant. [...] During the summer of 1987, Martin went out to perform a major salvage on the Republic to try to recover the gold, an event that generated international media attention. Capt. Bayerle was featured on television programs such as CBS Evening News, ABC Evening News, and ABC Good Morning America. [...] The 74-day salvage was also closely followed in international periodicals, such as Forbes, New York Times, Associated Press, Japan Times, London Times, [...] and the Los Angeles Times among many other major publications.|$|E
40|$|The noise {{generated}} by supersonic-tip-speed propellers is investigated. An eight bladed propeller was {{tested in the}} Lewis 8 - by 6 -foot wind tunnel with conditions providing data in the subsonic operating region of the propeller. These conditions resulted in a slight reshaping of the curve for blade passing tone {{as a function of}} helical tip Mach number as compared with previous results. Directivity curves with an additional transducer position gave an indication of a lobe pattern for this propeller that was not previously observed. The present data at the aft-most position indicate that some reflections, possibly from the test <b>rig</b> <b>support</b> strut, may have affected the data taken previously...|$|E
40|$|The {{helicopter}} pictured is the twin-turbine S- 76, {{produced by}} Sikorsky Aircraft division of United Technologies, Stratford, Connecticut. It {{is the first}} transport helicopter ever dey n e d purely as a commercial vehicle rather than an adaptation of a military design. Being built in large numbers for customers in 16 countries, the S- 76 is intended for offshore oil <b>rig</b> <b>support,</b> executive transportation and general utility service. The craft carries 12 passengers plus a crew of two and has a range of more than 450 miles-yet it weighs less than 10, 000 pounds. Significant weight reduction was achieved by use of composite materials, which are generally lighter but stronger than conventional aircraft materials.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the dynamic {{behaviour}} of a pipe in a resonant bending fatigue test rig is investigated. This kind of test rig {{is used for}} full scale testing of pipeline joints such as girth welds and threaded connections. In order to optimize the test conditions in such a test rig, accurate knowledge of its dynamic behaviour is necessary. This dynamic behaviour is first evaluated theoretically using a semi-analytical model to {{study the effects of}} pipe dimensions and test rig properties. Afterwards, the validity of this model is illustrated by experimental test results. To measure the bending deflection of the pipe during a test, a dynamic 3 D optical measurement system is used. Using the measurements it is shown that the dynamic behaviour of a pipe in the resonant bending test rig can be accurately predicted by the theoretical model. For a given pipe diameter and wall thickness size, the model prescribes the required pipe length, the necessity to fill the pipe with water, the necessary mass of the endweights, the systems natural frequency and the position of the test <b>rig</b> <b>supports...</b>|$|R
