We use a two-step cluster analysis to examine whether welldefined sub-groups exist in the health industry as identified by their investment choices and member demographics.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{individuals}} to increase retirement savings has been widely promoted, yet {{our understanding of the}} motivations of individuals to save at a higher rate remains sparse. This paper reports the findings of a survey of 2300 <b>retirement</b> <b>savings</b> <b>fund</b> members and their motivations to contribute more to savings and to actively manage their investment strategy. Utilising the theory of planned behavior, the study reveals respondent’s self-reported attitudes, subjective norms and perceptions of behavioral control account for a high proportion of the variance in behavioral intention. Contrary to expectations, the study finds that respondent’s risk tolerance adds little to the prediction of behavioral intention. By contrast, perceptions of planning importance and self-assessed planning preparedness (domain knowledge) are found to exert powerful indirect influences on behavioral intentions via the perceived behavioral control construct. This novel finding confirms the relevance of planning constructs and financial literacy to an understanding of retirement savings behavior, and establishes a need to improve levels of financial literacy in society...|$|E

In 1999 members of SSAU were asked to choose between a defined benefit scheme or one of four investment accumulation accounts.

The number of SMSFs has {{increased}} to {{more than half a}} million in two decades. Yet little is known about the reasons people start the funds and how they are operated. We combine survey responses of more than 500 SMSF members and 500 large superannuation fund members to understand the motivation of SMSF members and how they compare with similar people who stay with a large fund. Control over investments and tax minimisation are the most common reasons for starting a fund. Satisfaction with large funds and unwillingness to take on the administrative burden of self-management are the most common reasons for not doing so. SMSF members do not show more financial skill than non-members, but they do express a higher risk tolerance and a more trusting attitude to financial professionals. We present evidence that the majority of SMSF members start their funds at the suggestion of financial professionals. We also show that the types of people who say they are thinking about starting a SMSF are different in significant ways from the types of people who end up as SMSF members, further evidence for the influence of the advice industry...|$|R

Based on two nationally representative surveys collected two decades apart, we find that most individuals provide some response to the question, particularly when they are allowed to provide a range. Moreover, the responses that are given have substantial predictive power for actual <b>retirement</b> <b>savings,</b> even when compared to the savings in the initial wave. Despite this predictive power, there is evidence that responses do not satisfy the more stringent requirements of the rational expectations hypothesis. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{policy paper}} {{presents}} key findings and suggestions on Malaysia's old-age financial protection system {{within the context}} of the country's broader social security framework. The trademark policy approach focusing on job creation instead of expanding social security programs served the country well to move it quickly to a high-middle income level. But to join the club of high-income countries in a sustainable manner may require the country to review its approach to social security, including the way old-age income support is provided, and to address the main current weaknesses: fragmentation across economic sectors, lack of an enabling political environment, incomplete benefit coverage, low mandated savings level, and inadequate disbursement options given the challenges of projected population aging and socioeconomic shifts. To address the old-age financial protection challenge, the paper outlines two key options for Malaysia's Employees Provident Fund, the country's central pension pillar: (i) moving from a mere <b>retirement</b> <b>savings</b> investment <b>fund</b> to a fully-fledged pension fund that offers some minimum annuities; or (ii) more radically, moving the benefits toward a Non-Financial Defined Contribution scheme with the fund's resources used as its major reserve fund.

40|$|The {{fossil fuel}} {{industry}} is causing massive environmental damage and driving climate change. People are inadvertently supporting the fossil fuel industry through the investment decisions of their super funds, the custodians of their <b>retirement</b> <b>savings.</b> Many super <b>funds</b> have recognised {{the dangers of}} climate change, {{as well as the}} risks it poses to fossil fuel-related assets. However, the vast majority of Australian super funds are still invested in fossil fuels. We estimate losses on fossil fuel company investments in fifteen of Australia’s largest default super fund options at over $ 5. 6 billion over the period 2014 - 15. Fossil fuel stocks have underperformed over the two years studied, after many financial experts expressed concerns about the sector. The Paris climate summit confirmed the urgent global need to act on climate change. To have any hope of keeping temperature rise below two degrees, we cannot continue to invest in companies that would expand or prolong the fossil fuel industry. Super funds need to fully disclose their fossil fuel holdings and immediately divest from pure play fossil fuel companies. They must also engage with diversified companies to encourage a swift exit from the fossil fuel sector. Super fund members can use Super Switch to examine their exposure to coal, oil and gas companies and take action to get their <b>retirement</b> <b>savings</b> out of fossil fuels...|$|R
40|$|As defined {{contribution}} {{pension plans}} {{have become increasingly}} common {{over the past two}} decades, so have lump sum distributions from those plans. Employ-ees who elect such a distribution take the balance of their pension account with them when they leave a job. They can then choose to maintain the funds in accounts designated for retirement, invest them in other saving vehicles, or spend them. If spent pension distribu-tions are not replaced by other savings, however, the future elderly are unlikely to be able to maintain a desirable stan-dard of living. With employee-funded pensions expected to play an increasingly important role in financing Americans’ <b>retirement,</b> <b>saving</b> these <b>funds</b> is essen-tial. This article is the first {{to examine the relationship between}} retirement educa-tion—specifically, meetings sponsored by employers or by public and private institutions—and the saving of lump sum distributions.

40|$|Retirement {{planning}} {{is often seen}} as a tool that may assist individuals to successfully accumulate retirement capital. However, {{the low level of}} ‘customization’ of the general information on retirement planning may prompt some individuals to oversimplify their approach to <b>retirement</b> <b>savings</b> while discouraging others. Given the already weak propensity of Canadian households to accumulate <b>retirement</b> <b>savings,</b> this paper seeks to accentuate the importance associated with – and the complexity involved in – choosing the mix of savings instruments for accumulating retirement capital. The analysis shows that relying on private <b>retirement</b> <b>savings</b> continues to be of high importance for Canadian households. Some individuals may achieve the best saving outcome through the strategy that often would not be viewed as “saving for retirement”; however, comparing the outcomes of different savings options is challenging.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the structural reforms to their social security systems that many countries have adopted in recent years. In {{addition to a}} publicly managed social safety net, this strategy includes a <b>funded</b> component (<b>retirement</b> <b>savings),</b> with the <b>funds</b> privately managed. The basic rationale is that relying on partial pre-funding enhances system sustainability and has {{a positive impact on}} the broader economy by increasing long term national saving and labor market incentives. The paper contrasts how the funded pillar has developed in Latin America (where individual accounts prevail), the OECD countries (where group plans at the company or occupational level are common), and elsewhere. The relevance of these experiments in other countries for the social security debate in the U. S. is explored. If a portion of the current contribution rate to social security were Òcarved outÓ and placed in individual accounts that earn a market return, this would help to keep over-all benefits at their present level without a tax increase. It would increase the sustainability of the system and, under conditions specified in the paper, would also enhance economic growth.
