5|$|Overall, {{the relief}} is in {{excellent}} condition. It was originally received in three pieces and some fragments by the British Museum; after repair, some cracks are still apparent, in particular a triangular piece missing {{on the right}} edge, but the main features of the deity and the animals are intact. The figure's face has damage to its left side, {{the left side of}} the nose and the neck region. The headdress has some damage to its front and <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>side,</b> but the overall shape can be inferred from symmetry. Half of the necklace is missing and the symbol of the figure held in her right hand; the owls' beaks are lost and a piece of a lion's tail. A comparison of images from 1936 and 2005 shows that some modern damage has been sustained as well: the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>side</b> of the crown has now lost its top tier, and at the lower left corner a piece of the mountain patterning has chipped off and the owl has lost its right-side toes. However, in all major aspects, the relief has survived intact for more than 3,500years.|$|E

5|$|West Ham {{kicked the}} match off, as both teams {{lined up in}} a 4–4–2 formation. West Ham {{committed}} the first foul of the match in the first minute as Paul Konchesky brought down Steven Gerrard, but Liverpool were unable to capitalise on the resulting free kick. A few minutes later, West Ham midfielder Yossi Benayoun advanced down the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>side</b> of the pitch and passed {{the ball into the}} penalty area, but Liverpool defender Sami Hyypiä was able to intercept the ball before Ashton or Harewood received it. Harewood had the first shot on goal for West Ham in the 12th minute, but it was deflected out for a corner.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool got {{the second}} half under way, but it was West Ham who had the first attack of the half. Etherington {{advanced}} down the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>side</b> of the pitch and passed to Harewood, whose shot was saved by Reina, who also saved a subsequent shot from Benayoun. Liverpool had a chance immediately afterwards as Cissé passed to Alonso, but his shot was blocked and {{went out for a}} corner. A minute later, Liverpool made the first substitution of the match, as the injured Harry Kewell was replaced by Fernando Morientes. Liverpool equalised in the 54th minute, when Gerrard volleyed home a knock-down header from Crouch. The first yellow card of the match went to Ashton after he fouled Finnan in the 60th minute. Three minutes later, Carragher also received a yellow card for a foul on Ashton.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had {{a chance}} to take the lead before half-time. Phil Neal {{advanced}} down the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>side</b> of the pitch and found Dalglish who passed to Graeme Souness, who ran late through the Real defence. His subsequent shot was not held by Agustín Rodríguez, but Souness was unable to get to the rebounded ball. Real had the first chance of the second half. Liverpool's defence had stopped as they thought Cunningham was offside, however he was not and Camacho advanced towards Ray Clemence in the Liverpool goal. Clemence came off his line and ran towards the Real midfielder, Camacho attempted to lob the ball over the keeper, but his shot went over the goal.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{passages}} {{of the match}} were tentative. Faced with a hostile atmosphere, Liverpool were content {{to sit back and}} frustrate Roma. Despite this tactic, Liverpool took the lead in the 15th minute. Souness and Sammy Lee exchanged passes before passing to Craig Johnston on the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>side</b> of the pitch. Johnston played a high cross into the Roma penalty area, which was challenged for by Roma goalkeeper Franco Tancredi and Ronnie Whelan. The result was that Tancredi dropped the ball, Roma defenders tried to clear the ball, but Michele Nappi's attempted clearance bounced off Tancredi's back and fell to Liverpool defender Phil Neal who scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Two minutes later, Souness volleyed the ball into the Roma goal from close range, but his goal was disallowed for offside.|$|E

5|$|Most {{outbound}} O-Bahn bus routes {{travel through}} the Adelaide city centre along Grenfell Street, left onto East Terrace, right onto Rundle Road through the Adelaide park lands {{to the north of}} Rymill Park, then left onto Dequetteville Terrace, which changes name to Hackney Road at the next major intersection. The Adelaide Botanic Garden is then on the left, followed by Botanic Park before the road crosses a bridge over the River Torrens. Soon after here, the two carriageways of the city ring route separate and swing to the northwest past North Adelaide, and the northbound entrance to the O-Bahn busway leaves the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>side</b> of the surface road and dips under the southbound carriageway to join the inbound track, both heading northeast. This on-street route will change when the O-Bahn City Access Project (see below) opens at the end of 2017. That will provide a 670 metre guided busway tunnel straight on from Grenfell Street, passing under Rymill Park and Rundle Road to surface for a short distance of on-road running on Hackney Road.|$|E
5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>side</b> of the train {{and because of the}} limited visibility from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the footplate from his left hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.|$|E
5|$|That night, the Japanese made a minor {{attack against}} 'C' Company, {{but this was}} turned back with {{artillery}} and small arms. The following day the Australians resumed their attack. In doing so, McKinna ordered 'D' Company to renew the assault, aiming for Pear Hill, on the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>side</b> of the Australian line. Although it required a more physically draining approach march over Artillery Hill and through dense scrub, the tactic {{proved to be more}} successful than the previous day's efforts. Pear Hill was joined by a narrow razorback ridge that limited the Australian frontage to just three men side-by-side, who had to cut their way through the thick bamboo with machetes. Weighed down with full marching order and heavy weapons, including Vickers machine guns, the Australians found it heavy going. It took the majority of the afternoon to reach {{the crest of the hill}} where they were to form up for the final assault. A thirty-minute pause followed, after which an artillery barrage was called down upon the Japanese defenders. On their right, 'A' Company, began to draw the Japanese fire and at 15:30 hours 'D' Company attacked the ridge, across a thin saddle. By late afternoon, the Japanese defenders had pulled back from the ridge, leaving the Australians in possession of it after heavy fighting with 'D' Company securing the main position, while 'B' Company skirted north of Barton's Knoll and secured a secondary position below the ridge, which the Australians dubbed Baker's Brow. Meanwhile, on the Australian left—the western side of the battlefield—a Juki heavy machine and snipers held up 'C' Company's advance.|$|E

Introduction Large sparse linear systems with multiple <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>sides</b> occur in many applications, such as electro magnetics, {{and there is a}} need for efficient solvers. A variety of solvers have been introduced during the last decades, such as block CG and block BiCG [6], block GMRES [9] and various hybrid block GMRES schemes [8] as well as block Quasi-Newton methods [7] to solve these systems efficiently. This paper generalizes a new family of iterative solvers for linear systems with single <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>sides,</b> the family of EN-like methods [3] [4], to solve systems with multiple <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>sides.</b> This new family of [...] ...|$|R
