The eastern North American population of monarchs can travel thousands of miles south-west to overwintering sites in Mexico. There is a <b>reverse</b> <b>migration</b> in the spring. It has recently been shown that the British painted lady undertakes a 9,000-mile round trip in a series of steps by up to six successive generations, from tropical Africa to the Arctic Circle — almost double the length of the famous migrations undertaken by monarch. Spectacular large-scale migrations associated with the monsoon are seen in peninsular India.

40|$|Imaging of salt is a known {{geophysical}} challenge, since salt has complex geology, {{with varying}} lithology and complicated structures. Salt diapir can have steep dips and obtaining a correct velocity models {{are some of}} the issues related to imaging salt structures. Three 2 D seismic lines and one velocity model from the Uranus prospect drilled in the Nordkapp Basin in the Barents Sea were investigated. Two depth migrations have been applied and compared; the <b>reverse</b> time <b>migration</b> and split-step Fourier <b>migration.</b> Since <b>reverse</b> time <b>migration</b> is known to be costly, but better suited for complex structures, the objective was to assess the value of <b>reverse</b> time <b>migration.</b> Then two single-spread lines have been migrated with pre-stack <b>reverse</b> time <b>migration,</b> compared, and combined into one split-spread line. The objective was to examine the value of acquiring costly split-spread surveys. A third objective was to study the velocity sensitivity of pre-stack <b>reverse</b> time <b>migration</b> by systematically altering the velocity model. <b>Reverse</b> time <b>migration</b> proved to handle steep dips, diffractions and large lateral velocity changes when applied to seismic containing two salt diapirs. The split-step Fourier migration produced good results for smaller dips, and had higher resolution of layers. In the presence of multiples, near vertical dips and large velocity contrast, the split-step Fourier migration was unable to image an adequate result. Since the salt diapirs had dips in opposite directions, the single-spread lines each provided shots in up-dip direction and thereby different imaging of the salt flanks. In most cases, the split-spread derived a depth and angle between the two single-spreads, which made the interpretation of the split-spread ambiguous. As the velocity was increased, the interpretations of the flanks showed an overall improvement and reflections were moved to greater depths. The opposite was true for a velocity decrease. Deviation from the initial velocity model increased with depth. None of the measures improved the imaging of the flanks when the data quality was poor. The <b>reverse</b> time <b>migration</b> proved to handle the complexities associated with great dips and large lateral velocity changes better, and is preferred for imaging salt diapirs. Split-step Fourier migration offers a reasonable alternative if dips are small. Acquiring a split-spread line was evaluated to be desirable when only 2 D data is provided. Single-spread data can be viewed separately to avoid ambiguous interpretations. Results indicate that the initial velocity model estimated too low velocities in the sediment layers. Improved imaging of the salt flanks shows that pre-stack <b>reverse</b> time <b>migration</b> is velocity sensitive. Throughout the study no base salt reflection was imaged, and changes in the velocity model or acquiring of 3 D data could improve the results. In addition, one should strive to obtain high quality data when dealing with complex structures. </p...|$|R

We analyze three-dimensional staggered grid finite difference method for the implementation on GPU, making possible the industrial application of 3 D pre-stack <b>reverse</b> time <b>migration</b> and inversion.

40|$|In {{hydrocarbon}} exploration, wave-equation migration techniques play {{an important}} role in imaging the complex geological structures. Usually, post-stack migration scheme is applied to the seismic data to improve the resolution with restoration of dipping reflectors to their true position. As a result, the migrated time sections are interpretable in terms of subsurface features. As a numerical study, three fault models are considered for the present study. First of all, synthetic time sections are generated corresponding to three models. Later, post stack migration schemes such as Gazdag(PS), Phase-shift with turning rays and <b>reverse</b> time <b>migration</b> (T-K) domain techniques are applied in order to judge the imaging accuracy, preservation of true amplitude and computational speed. All the three post stack time migrated sections delineate the structure with their throw. However, the <b>reverse</b> time <b>migrations</b> (T-K) clearly delineate the reflectors in restoring the throw properly with minimum computational time. In order to test the validity the numerical results, similar exercise has been undertaken using field seismic data of KG basin, India.
