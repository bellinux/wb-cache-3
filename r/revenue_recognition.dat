During 2000, Arthur Andersen earned $25 million in audit fees and $27 million in consulting fees (this amount accounted for roughly 27% of the audit fees of public clients for Arthur Andersen's Houston office). The auditor's methods were questioned as either being completed solely to receive its annual fees or for its lack of expertise in properly reviewing Enron's <b>revenue</b> <b>recognition,</b> special entities, derivatives, and other accounting practices.|$|E

We compare state telemarketing campaign reports with the associated information from nonprofits annual Form 990 filings to directly test nonprofits <b>revenue</b> and expense <b>recognition</b> policies. Our study indicates that smaller nonprofits, and those with less accounting sophistication, are more likely to inappropriately report telemarketing costs as a component of net revenues rather than as expenses. In addition, less monitored firms are more likely to report telemarketing campaign revenues net of expenses. Additionally, among those firms that do report telemarketing costs as expenses, we find that smaller firms, and those with relatively less officer compensation, are more likely to allocate telemarketing expenses to non-fundraising expense categories.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of market-based mechanisms to reduce {{greenhouse gas emissions}} presents a challenge for accountants who are now required to reflect the new economic given to carbon credits and related assets in the company accounts. Given the absence of formal accounting guidelines, carbon market participants (liable entities and carbon credit providers) {{around the world are}} able to select accounting practices and reporting methods based on individual judgment. The main aim of this thesis is to explore current accounting practices (asset classification, sequent measurement and impairment testing) of Australian carbon credit providers. In addition to exploring the underlying reasons for specific accounting practices, this study also aims to uncover emerging normative views drawing on expert opinions. The study was conducted using case-study methodology and in-depth interviews, supported by archival data and secondary data. The study used institutional theory to interpret research interviews. In general, it was found that disclosures of related accounting information are incomparable {{due to the lack of}} formal benchmark guidelines. While the research results show accounting practices for carbon credits and related assets are in accordance with existing general accounting standards and conceptual frameworks, the preferred asset classification of carbon credits varies among the case site participants, according to specific market requirements and economic uncertainty. Applicable values and valuation methods differ from case site to case site due to the nature of each company’s business, internal operations and economic factors. Impairment testing conducted by each organisation requires reference price indices from various sources, but basically they are determined by the nature of assets and professionals. <b>Revenue</b> and expense <b>recognition</b> greatly relies on accounting estimation made by in-house, on-hand and external forestry professionals from government agencies and private bodies. When trying to elicit an emerging normative viewpoint, the expert views indicate asset classification, valuation, impairment; <b>revenue</b> and expense <b>recognition</b> should be prepared conservatively, based on a true and fair view. In conclusion, accounting policy makers and professional accountants in Australia need to address these issues to improve the quality of the accounting information in this area. Further research should focus on the implications and other developments of the carbon credit accounting practices...|$|R

40|$|Timely {{recognition}} of losses and expenses compared to revenues and increased values precipitates future expenses {{to match with}} current <b>revenues.</b> Thus, timely <b>recognition</b> of losses acts to reduce the persistence of earnings. However, {{it is expected that}} a more timely {{recognition of}} negative cash flows, as bad news, increase the power of earnings for predicting future cash flows. This study investigates the effects of the timely recognition of bad news (loss) versus the good news on the decrease of the persistence of earnings, and the effect of negative cash flows on forecasting future cash flows. In this study, two pooling type models and a panel type model have been used to estimate the persistence of earnings and cash flows. Seventy eight firms that were listed in the Tehran Stock Exchange during the period 2003 – 2010 were duly reviewed. The results of this research proved that the timely recognition of loss does not affect the persistence and the power of earnings for the purpose of forecasting future cash flows. The findings imply that conservatism does not distort persistence of earnings...|$|R
