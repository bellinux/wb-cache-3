In Experiments 1 and 5, the effect of suckling on starved calves and lambs was investigated. Insulin rose from 10 ng/ml {{at the onset of}} suckling, as did the GH levels in plasma of their dams. In Experiments 2 and 4, the effect of changing plasma energy substrate levels was investigated in calves. In Experiment 2, it was observed that a 30 -second jugular infusion of either volatile fatty acids in an equimolecular mixture of acetate, propionate and butyrate, or glucose (both administered at 1. 25 mM per kg body weight (bw)) resulted in a variable, but significant increase in insulin levels, but had no effect on growth hormone or prolactin. The results of 1. 4 mM per kg bw glucose administration in Experiment 4, confirmed those of Experiment 2.

40|$|This {{review of}} the {{immunological}} diagnosis of parasitic diseases defines the various indications, the means of collection and preparation, the various levels of specificity and the choice of parasitic antigen which {{should be used for}} immuno-diagnosis. The detection and assay of circulating antibodies relies on the techniques of immuno-precipitation (immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, electrosyneresis), indirect agglutination (latex and haemagglutination) or the use of labelled compounds (immunofluorescence, enzymo-immunoassay, <b>radio-immunoassay).</b> Their respective advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The detection and assay of circulating antigens involve the use of agglutination techniques (mycoses), <b>radio-immunoassay</b> or enzymo-immunoassay (protozooses and helminthiases). The authors review the applications of immunological diagnosis for the helminthiases (Trichinosis, Toxocarosis, Filariasis, Anguillosis, Ascaridiasis, Echinococcosis, Taeniasis and Cysticercosis, Distomatosis and Schistosomiasis), the protozoan infections (malaria, Toxoplasmosis, Amebiasis, Trypanosomiasis, Leishmaniasis) and the mycoses (Aspergillosis, Candidiasis, Cryptococcosis). They also discuss the prospects for the development of immunological diagnosis by identification, purification and standardization of parasitic antigens and the study of circulating antigens and idiotypic anti-parasitic antibodies. Finally, they outline the respective responsibilities of the biologist and the prescribing doctor for the proper use of immunological diagnosis of parasitic diseases.

Besides antigen and antibody, this method also requires radioactive labels (e.g., 125 I, 32 P, and 14 C). By measuring the radioactivity, {{it is possible to}} determine the concentration of the target antigen in the sample. It is reliable and sensitive, so RIA has been used to measure melatonin [62], progestagens [63], and estriol [64, 65]. Naicker et al. [66] implemented an application of <b>radio-immunoassays</b> to assess the fate of estrogens (estrone, estradiol, and estriol) in wastewater effluents of South Africa.

Because these antisera displayed considerable cross-reactions to-wards testosterone, 5 a-dihydrotestosterone and 5 a-dihydronandrolone, {{it proved to be}} necessary to separate nandrolone from these cross-reacting steroids prior to the <b>radio-immunoassay.</b> Using Celite/ethylene glycol columns a complete Separation could be achieved between nandrolone and these cross-reacting steroids. The assay procedure involved extraction with ethyl acetate, chromatography on Celite/ethylene glycol columns, overnight incubation of samples and Standards with antiserum and labelled compound, bound/free Separation with dextran-coated charcoal and counting of the supernatant in a liquid scintillation counter. Recoveries for the total assay procedure (expressed äs fractions) were between 0. 85 and 1. 01.

40|$|Summary. -Normal monkey tissues {{were found}} to contain an antigen which cross-reacts immunologically with the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of the human {{digestive}} tract. The monkey antigen reacted with complete or partial identity to the normal crossreacting antigen (NCA) in humans when tested in immunodiffusion against anti-CEA or anti-NCA. Extracts of monkey tissues inhibited in <b>radio-immunoassays</b> measuring human NCA. It is possible that monkey foetuses and colonic tumours contain CEA.

Rat tumours have been found to contain antigens resembling CEA in some of their properties (Stevens et al., 1975; Abeyonis and Milgrom, 1976), but im-munological and biochemical evidence that they are related to human CEA is lacking. We have recently shown that Cyno-molgus monkeys immunized with CEA produce antibodies which are more specific for CEA than those produced by rabbits or sheep (Ruoslahti et al., 1976).

Methods Groups of 6 – 7 female lactating rabbits maintained with their litters or separated from them for 48 h were killed by decapitation on day 11 post-partum, at 6 different time points throughout a 24 -h cycle, starting at 0900 h.

Theoretically sound though the technique may be, there are many technical problems which need to be overcome before it becomes universally acceptable. This issue will lay emphasis on isotopes of iodine and their applications in the radio-immunology, thyroid gland etc. This member of the halogen family, besides being an essential element in the human body, also has many radioisotopes which can be easily attached to various substances as a radioactive label (tables 1 a,b). Radio-nuclide immunology <b>Radio-immunoassay</b> Berson and Yalow were the first to develop the technique of <b>radio-immunoassay</b> (RIA) in 1958 using these isotopes. RIA can be used to quantify any substance in the body fluids against which an antibody can be raised, viz. all peptide hormones and many antigens (HbSag, oncofoetal antigen etc). It is a rapid (within a few hours) and sensitive method as compared to bioassay (which is time-consuming, expensive and less specific). RIA depends on quantitative interaction between an antigen (ag) and its specific antibody (ab).

We have used the <b>radio-immunoassay</b> method to measure the specific content of immunoreactive TGF-alpha in the acid ethanol extracts of normal and cancerous tissues of human colon and lung. The average TGF-alpha content of colon carcinomas is 4 {{times that of the}} normal mucosa, and for non-small cell lung carcinomas it is twice that of the normal parenchyma. Because of variability in the TGF-alpha expression among individuals and in different segments of colon and lobes of lung, the ratio of TGF-alpha content of paired tumour and normal tissue was also calculated.

Although 55 % of colon tumours show a ratio 4 times, or greater, only 33 % of lung carcinomas demonstrate this ratio. The level of TGF-alpha in both colon and lung carcinomas does not correlate with histological type stage, grade nor degree of desmoplasia of these tumours.

Cell donors were 24 clinically immune, healthy African adult native residents of a P. falciparum-endemic region, Haut-Ogooué, Gabon, and seven non-immune, European temporary residents with a history of a single to a few malaria infections during the previous 1 to 9 months. When PBMC were cultured in medium alone or with RBC antigen no or low titres of IFN-gamma were detected. PBMC proliferation and IFN-gamma production observed in the presence of mAg were dose dependent and significantly correlated. When cultured with mAg, PBMC from non-immune Europeans produced significantly higher levels of IFN-gamma than did PBMC from clinically immune Africans. No such difference was found when PBMC were cultured with PWM. The mAg-induced IFN-gamma production was due mainly to CD 4 + T cells and was not enhanced by CD 8 + T cell depletion. No IFN-alpha was detected in culture supernatants. Thus, P. falciparum antigens are able to induce in vitro production of IFN-gamma by CD 4 + T cells; however, in this sample, individuals considered to be clinically resistant to malaria were low producers of IFN-gamma...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{summarize}} why and how liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is increasingly replacing other methodologies for the measurement of sex steroids. RECENT FINDINGS Measurement of sex steroids, particularly testosterone and estradiol, is important for diagnosis or management {{of a host of}} conditions (e. g. disorders of puberty, hypogonadism, polycystic ovary syndrome, amenorrhea, and tumors of ovary, testes, breast and prostate). Historically, metabolites of testosterone and estradiol were measured as ketosteroids in urine using colorimetric assays that lacked sensitivity and specificity due to endogenous and exogenous interferences. Extracted competitive manual <b>radio-immunoassays</b> provided improved, but still imperfect, specificity, and offered increased sensitivity. As testing demand increased, they were displaced by automated immunoassays. These offered better throughput and precision, but suffered worse specificity problems. Moreover, agreement between different immunoassays has often been poor and they are all compromised by a limited dynamic measurement range. To overcome these problems, LC-MS/MS methods have been developed and validated for quantitation of sex steroids. These methods reduce interferences, provide better specificity, improve dynamic range, and reduce between-method bias. SUMMARY Endocrine Society and Urology Society guidelines have highlighted the limitations of the immunoassays for sex steroids and have provided convincing evidence that mass spectrometric methods are preferable for measurement of sex steroid hormones. In this review, we describe LC-MS/MS methods for measurement of testosterone and estradiol...|$|R
40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) -alpha is a pleiotropic cytokine up-regulated in inflammatory bowel disease, {{rheumatoid arthritis}} and psoriasis. The introduction of anti-TNF {{drugs such as}} infliximab has revolutionized the treatment of these diseases. Recently, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of infliximab has been introduced in clinical decision making to increase cost-efficiency. Nowadays, TDM is performed using <b>radio-immunoassays,</b> homogeneous mobility shift assays or ELISA. Unfortunately, these assays do not allow for in situ treatment optimization, because of the required sample transportation to centralized laboratories and the subsequent assay execution time. In this perspective, we evaluated the potential of fiber optic-surface plasmon resonance (FO-SPR). To achieve this goal, a panel of 55 monoclonal anti-infliximab antibodies (MA-IFX) was developed and characterized in-house, leading to the identification of nine different clusters. Based on this high diversity, 22 antibody pairs were selected and tested for their reactivity towards IFX, using one MA-IFX as capture and one MA-IFX for detection, in a sandwich type ELISA and FO-SPR. This study showed that the reactivity towards IFX of each antibody pair in ELISA is highly similar to its reactivity on FO-SPR, indicating that antibody pairs are easily transferable between both platforms. Given the fact that FO-SPR shows the potential for miniaturization and fast assay time, it {{can be considered a}} highly promising platform for on-site infliximab monitoring. status: publishe...|$|R
