5|$|This {{exothermic}} reaction is very slow below 100°C, but at temperature above 900°C {{the reaction is}} rapid. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979, but at that time, the containment building was not damaged. The same reaction occurred in the reactors 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011 leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. After venting the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors, the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded, severely damaging the installations {{and at least one}} of the containment buildings. To avoid explosion, the direct venting of hydrogen to the open atmosphere would have been a preferred design option. Now, to prevent the risk of explosion in many pressurized water reactor (PWR) containment buildings, a catalyst-based recombinator is installed that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water at <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>before</b> the hazard arises.|$|E

This study focused on the awareness of residents to energy conservation and on the potential of reducing energy demand through energy-saving activities.

5000|$|CA {{adhesives}} {{have a short}} shelf life. Date-stamped containers help {{to ensure}} that the adhesive is still viable. One manufacturer supplies the following information and advice: When kept unopened in a cool, dry location such as a refrigerator at a temperature of about 55 °F (13 °C), the shelf life of cyanoacrylate will be extended from about one year from manufacture to at least 15 months. If the adhesive is to be used within six months, {{it is not necessary to}} refrigerate it. Cyanoacrylates are moisture-sensitive, and moving from a cool to a hot location will create condensation; after removing from the refrigerator, it is best to let the adhesive reach <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>before</b> opening. After opening, it should be used within 30 days. Open containers should not be refrigerated. Another manufacturer says that the maximum shelf life of 12 months is obtained for some of their cyanoacrylates if the original containers are stored at [...] User forums and some manufacturers say that an almost unlimited shelf life is attainable by storing unopened at , the typical temperature of a domestic freezer, and allowing the contents to reach <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>before</b> use. Rechilling an opened container may cause moisture from the air to condense in the container; however, reports from hobbyists suggest that storing CA in a freezer can preserve opened cyanoacrylate indefinitely.|$|E

Purpose: Stationary observers often experience illusory self-motion (vection) when {{they are exposed to}} large patterns of optic flow. The effect of different temperatures on the strength of vection was investi-gated. Method: Eleven participants were exposed to visual stimuli that induced illusory motion (up, down) in three <b>room</b> <b>temperatures</b> (26 ˚C- 27 ˚C, 21 ˚C- 22 ˚C, 5 ˚C- 6 ˚C).

Results: Upward vection was rated as stronger than downward vection in the 26 ˚C- 27 ˚C temperature. In addition, after experiencing upward and downward vection, subjective ratings of <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> decreased and increased, respectively, when the <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> was 26 ˚C- 27 ˚C.

5000|$|Optical discs can {{be damaged}} by {{exposure}} to extreme temperatures; direct sunlight may overheat the disc or damage the data layer with UV rays. Exposure to heat and light have different effects on discs with data and metal layers of different composition. In all optical discs high temperatures can cause the substrate to soften and the disc to warp. Ambient heat, heat build-up, and light do little to damage the data layer of a ROM disc as it is made of aluminium; the only known problem occurring with the prolonged exposure of ROM discs to light is [...] "clouding" [...] or [...] "coloring" [...] of the polycarbonate substrate. CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R, CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVD-RAM discs are all affected {{by exposure to}} ambient heat as well as heat build-up due to direct sunlight. A CD-R’s data layer is made of dye that degrades at high temperatures, becoming less transparent so that pits and lands are read incorrectly, making the data unreadable. UV rays in sunlight are energetic enough to produce a photochemical reaction that changes the optical properties of the dye. RW and RAM discs' data layers are composed of a phase-changing film that is even more sensitive to heat than the dye found in R discs, so that they degrade even faster when subjected to ambient heat or direct sunlight. The phase-changing film in RW and RAM discs is not light-sensitive, and UV rays do not affect the optical properties of the film. After being exposed to freezing temperatures a disc’s separate layers may warm at different speeds, causing separation of the layers. If heated or cooled significantly a disc {{should be allowed to}} return to <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>before</b> use.|$|E
