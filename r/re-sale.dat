5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, {{some critics have}} argued that this would create a {{differential}} between the price of new and used goods, which may take years to equalize. Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used goods, creating environmental benefits of re-use and <b>re-sale.</b> Conversely, {{it is argued that}} like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost (see Theories of retail pricing), used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.|$|E
5|$|Jaguars were {{successfully}} {{sold to a}} number of overseas countries, India being the most prolific operator. The Jaguar International was an export version which was sold to Ecuador, Nigeria and Oman. The Ecuadorian Air Force, the only Latin American export customer, purchased 10 single- and 2 two-seat variants, officially designated Jaguars ES and EB, respectively. The first of twelve aircraft arrived in January 1977. They were used mainly for ground attack roles and occasionally for air superiority duties during the Cenepa War with Peru in 1995, but {{the main part of the}} fleet was held in reserve in case of a wider conflict with the Peruvians. Nigeria ordered 13 single-seat SN and 5 two-seat BN variants; SEPECAT delivered the first of these in May 1984. A subsequent order for an 18-aircraft second batch was cancelled. Some of those in service were withdrawn from operations on the grounds of economy, with the remaining aircraft put up for <b>re-sale.</b> The Royal Air Force of Oman, like Ecuador, ordered 10 single-seat and 2 two-seat variants, designated Jaguars OS and OB, respectively; the first was delivered in March 1977. A second identical 12-aircraft order was placed in the mid-1980s; these were joined by two ex-IAF and ex-RAF examples. The last of the Omani aircraft were retired on 6 August 2014.|$|E

State senator James A. Clark, Jr., a multigenerational owner of Clark's Elioak Farm, helped champion legislation to fund agricultural preservation. The program is partially funded {{through a combination}} of agricultural use-change taxes and transfer taxes from countywide new home sales and <b>re-sales.</b> The County pays the property owner small interest payments over thirty years for its development rights with a final balloon payment to the owner funded using 30 year zero coupon treasury obligation bonds.|$|R
25|$|In 1996, {{a scandal}} broke {{surrounding}} two Ozone Park Jewish cemeteries, Mokom Sholom Cemetery and Bayside Cemetery, which share a coterminous tract bounded by 80th and 84th Streets and Liberty and Pitkin Avenues with Acacia Cemetery, {{which was not}} involved. Allegations of the re-using of graves of long-dead mostly infants and small children from the mid-to-late 19th Century, for <b>re-sale</b> to recent Russian Jewish immigrants, were made against the owners of Mokom Sholom, and both it and Bayside had also been ravaged (Mokom Sholom more) {{by a combination of}} vandals, grave-robbers, and self-styled necromancers.

The African captives, who had been kidnapped in Sierra Leone and illegally sold into slavery and shipped to Cuba, escaped their shackles and took over the ship. They killed the captain and the cook; two other crew members escaped in a lifeboat. The Africans directed the survivors to return them to Africa. The crew tricked them, sailing north at night. The Amistad was later apprehended near Long Island, New York, by the United States Revenue Cutter Service and taken into custody. The widely publicized court cases in the United States federal district and Supreme Court, which addressed international issues, helped the abolitionist movement.|$|E
25|$|Levi's Stadium has {{received}} some backlash from season ticket holders, who are unhappy regarding rules that won’t {{allow them to}} print their tickets until 72 hours before the game, making <b>re-sale</b> very difficult. In addition, older 49ers fans say that people are more segmented at Levi's Stadium in comparison to Candlestick Park, leaving tailgaters with large expanses of empty parking stalls and a more desolate tailgating experience. Levi's Stadium has also received heavy criticism for the way fans are treated on hot days during early-season afternoon games. The majority of fans are seated {{on the east side}} of the stadium and during these afternoon games, they are exposed to the sun as there is no shade provided due to the lack of overhangs. With the climate of Santa Clara being much warmer than San Francisco, it makes watching games on hot days uncomfortable for fans as they are less accommodated for exposure to the sun than are patrons at other stadiums in hot-weather climates. Several fans suffered heat exhaustion during preseason and early season afternoon games. This has led to the eastern stands being largely empty on hot days.|$|E
50|$|The {{ownership}} of the airport has been remarkably steady since the buy-out, a testimony to how well the original ownership structure was conceived and assembled. There were originally 23 private shareholders {{and there has been}} very little change. Most of the <b>re-sales</b> have been taken up by existing owners under new company names so there has been a small increase to the current 25 owners, plus the Mayondi BEE consortium and Ekurhuleni Town Council. The ownership structure of the airport is unique in that most of the hangars are owned with full freehold title. Some of the tenants elected not to buy their hangars and so these are owned by the Airport Holding company and are leased to tenants, which provides essential long term income for the airport and additional revenue to maintain and improve the facilities.|$|R

However, a range of complexity in the computer RL system becomes barrier for the companies to maximize their long-term profits. This research paper presents a conceptual model to measure computer manufacturer&# 039;s RL profitability affected by six influence factors, namely part type, return quality, market attractiveness, custom duty percentage, shipment cost, and recovery facility location attractiveness. The conceptual modeling is performed by using the qualitative phase of system dynamics (SD) methodology on the computer part recovery system networks covering collection, segregation, shipment, recovery operations, <b>re-sales,</b> and disposal activities. The corresponding results are presented in process flow, causal loop and stock and flow diagrams which lead to further development using the quantitative phase of SD approach...|$|R
40|$|Investors in 8 ̆ 5 nancial markets {{often have}} to {{liquidate}} when {{the value of their}} port-folio has fallen signi 8 ̆ 5 cantly. When many investors have to do so at the same time, prices will typically be depressed (8 ̆ 5 <b>re-sales,</b> crashes). I show that this has im-portant implications for investorsoptimal ex-ante portfolio decisions. In particular, it becomes rational for investors to forego diversi 8 ̆ 5 cation bene 8 ̆ 5 ts. The reason is that the risk of having to liquidate jointly gives investors an incentive to hold diverse portfolios. Investors hence (collectively) invest in all possible portfolio allocations. Some investors even optimally hold completely undiversi 8 ̆ 5 ed portfolios. I also derive a diversi 8 ̆ 5 cation-irrelevance result: in equilibrium an investors pay-o ¤ (net of the endogenous costs of liquidation) is independent of the diversi 8 ̆ 5 cation of his portfolio. There are also consequences for the pricing of assets. An investor has a lower pay-o¤ from investing in assets held by many investors subject to liquidation risk, which is because this increases the risk that he has to liquidate {{at a time when many}} others do so as well. Such assets are hence traded at a discount...|$|R
25|$|After the sorting of {{materials}} is finished, the Zabbaleen sell the sorted materials, such as paper, tin, rags, plastic materials, cloth, etc. The Zabbaleen sell these sorted materials to factories that then reuse these products, such as paper, {{in the creation}} of new material. According to Engi Wassef, the director of the documentary film, Marina of the Zabbaleen, PT plastic, which is the plastic used to make plastic bottles for water and other beverages, {{is one of the most}} highly sought out materials. In the case of PT plastic, the Zabbaleen would even export this material to China. However, the simple <b>re-sale</b> of sorted materials is not the only activity that the Zabbaleen do in terms of re-using these materials. They also create new materials from the materials that they have sorted. For example, granulators are used to change regular opaque-colored plastic into small plastic pellets. From these plastic pellets, a variety of plastic product can then be made, including garbage bags and plastic hangers. Handmade crafts are also made from rags and paper. Thus, the Zabbaleen system is a multi-tier system that is not limited to the simple collection of waste but also encompasses the creation of new materials from found recyclables.|$|E
500|$|The FairTax {{would be}} tax free on {{mortgage}} interest {{up to the}} federal borrowing rate for like-term instruments {{as determined by the}} Treasury, but since savings, education, and other investments would be tax free under the plan, the FairTax could decrease the incentive to spend more on homes. [...] An analysis in 2008 by the Baker Institute For Public Policy concluded that the FairTax would have significant transitional issues for the housing sector since the investment would no longer be tax-favored. In a 2007 study, the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that total charitable giving would increase under the FairTax, although increases in giving would not be distributed proportionately amongst the various types of charitable organizations. The FairTax may also affect state and local government debt as the federal income tax system provides tax advantages to municipal bonds. Proponents believe environmental benefits would result from the FairTax through environmental economics and the re-use and <b>re-sale</b> of used goods. Advocates argue the FairTax would provide an incentive for illegal immigrants to legalize as they would otherwise not receive the rebate. Proponents also believe that the FairTax would have positive effects on civil liberties that are sometimes charged against the income tax system, such as social inequality, economic inequality, financial privacy, self-incrimination, unreasonable search and seizure, burden of proof, and due process.|$|E

60|$|The false {{principles}} of this unmercantile transaction (to {{speak of it}} in the mildest terms) were too gross not to be visible to those who contrived it. That the Company should be made to borrow such a sum as two hundred thousand pounds[7] at eight per cent, (or terms deemed by the Company to be worse,) in order first to buy a commodity represented by themselves as depreciated in its ordinary market, in order afterwards to carry one half of it through a circuitous trading voyage, depending for its ultimate success on the prudent and fortunate management of two or three sales, and purchases and <b>re-sales</b> of goods, and the chance of two or three markets, with all the risks of sea and enemy, was plainly no undertaking for such a body. The activity, private interest, and the sharp eye of personal superintendency may now and then succeed in such projects; but the remote inspection and unwieldy movements of great public bodies can find nothing but loss in them. Their gains, comparatively small, ought to be upon sure grounds; but here (as the Council states the matter) the private trader actually declines to deal, which is a proof more than necessary to demonstrate the extreme imprudence of such an undertaking on the Company's account. Still stronger and equally obvious objections lay to that member of the project which regards the introduction of a contraband commodity into China, sent at such a risk of seizure not only of the immediate object to be smuggled in, but of all the Company's property in Canton, and possibly at a hazard to the existence of the British factory at that port.|$|R
40|$|Community Land Trusts (CLTs) are a {{model of}} community-based, perpetually {{affordable}} housing that has been operating in the United States for the past 30 years and has more recently been established in the United Kingdom.   This study found that Community Land Trust models {{have the potential to}} enhance tenure choices for Indigenous households in Australia provided a range of issues are addressed, including facilitating suitable leasehold arrangements, safeguarding Indigenous land tenure and providing adequate public subsidies for CLTs. Community Land Trusts (CLTs) are intermediate tenure forms that address housing affordability by retaining subsidies in the valuation of the property. CLTs create affordable home ownership that remains affordable across <b>re-sales</b> and inheritance, and establishes clear and ongoing relationships between home owners and their community. Recent AHURI research has shown that Indigenous people are interested in forms of affordable home ownership that allow them to hand their property on to children (see Memmott et al. in Project 20501). This study assessed whether CLTs might offer a way of providing home ownership that is both affordable and consistent with Indigenous aspirations. Three models of CLTs are found to be relevant to the Australian context: ‘classic’ CLT models that separate fixtures from land and involve a long term ground lease between the resident and the partner organisation; integrated packages in which both housing and land are leased from a partner organisation; and a modified dual mortgage scheme in which the entire value of the house is split with a partner organisation. This study found that legal, land ownership, cultural and financial issues will need to be addressed at a local level to achieve the successful operation of CLT models in Australia: Legal: the separation of fixtures from land is unfamiliar as a housing model in Australia. The most readily available mechanism may be to grant a long term lease to the house and land via existing leasehold mechanisms, with greater flexibility achieved through the use of 99 -year lease arrangements. Land tenure: the ownership arrangements for Indigenous land mean that the financing and ownership arrangements for non-community members needs further consideration.  The governance structures around entry and exit into CLTs may have to be negotiated with Indigenous community members. Cultural: moving into a form of home ownership entails different responsibilities from being a tenant.  Households may require additional support and training in order to ensure the transition can be managed and that the risks are minimised.  This is essential in the prevention of defaults and avoiding the necessity of a CLT having to buy back the interest in a CLT property that has been sold either as part equity or as a 99 -year lease. Financial: {{there is a need for}} public subsidy to underpin any future home ownership schemes for Indigenous households aspiring to move from rental housing into some form of low cost home ownership.     Authors: Louise Crabtree, Hazel Blunden, Vivienne Milligan, Peter Phibbs and Carolyn Sappideen, with Nicole Moore...|$|R

2500|$|Proponents believe {{environmental}} benefits would result both indirectly and directly from {{implementation of the}} FairTax. [...] Former Senator Mike Gravel has called it a [...] "green tax". [...] The concepts of environmental economics come into play {{with some of the}} aspects suggested. With the FairTax being levied only on new goods and services, with no federal tax charged on used goods, supporters suggest a systemic incentive to buy used goods is introduced. Consequently, re-use and <b>re-sale</b> of used goods is encouraged. With the subsequent increase of the used-goods market (and with new goods being taxed) it is suspected that people would put more emphasis on maintenance of things for longer use and better resale value, and that they may also shy away from disposable goods. [...] The significant reduction of paperwork for IRS compliance and tax forms is estimated to save about 300,000 trees each year. [...] With the expected increase of business and manufacturing movement to the U.S., more goods consumed domestically will be produced domestically. This may reduce international shipping and consequent environmental impact, as well as production in countries with less stringent pollution controls.|$|E

By this transaction it appears clearly that the contract was given to Mr. Sulivan for no other purpose than to supply him with a sum of money; and the sale and <b>re-sale</b> seem strongly to indicate that the reduction of the penalty, and the other favorable conditions, were not granted for his ease in a business which he never was to execute, but to heighten the value of the object which he was to sell.
