5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is {{the ability}} to resist the temptation for an immediate <b>reward</b> and wait for a later <b>reward.</b> Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate <b>reward</b> in order to receive a larger or more enduring <b>reward</b> later. A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of time until an eventual <b>reward</b> also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} <b>reward</b> will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the <b>reward</b> is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the immediate <b>reward,</b> even if their delayed <b>reward</b> would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait.|$|E

5|$|When {{animals are}} faced with a choice to either wait for a <b>reward,</b> or receive a <b>reward</b> right away, the {{discounting}} of the <b>reward</b> is hyperbolic. As the length of time of waiting for a <b>reward</b> increases, the <b>reward</b> is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time, only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging. Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting. In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, macaque monkeys were given the choice of a medium <b>reward</b> that they knew they would receive, versus a more risky choice. The riskier choice would <b>reward</b> the monkey with a large <b>reward</b> fifty percent of the time, and a small <b>reward</b> the other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky, but rather as a large, delayed <b>reward.</b> They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large <b>reward</b> as certain: if they did not get the large <b>reward</b> the first time around, they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay.|$|E

It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the <b>reward</b> must have some value to the participant. Without a <b>reward</b> that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the <b>reward</b> is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E

40|$|Any {{solution}} to rising levels of CO 2 depends on human behavior. One common approach to changing human behavior is <b>rewarding</b> desired behavior. Because financial incentives often have side effects that diminish efficacy, we predict that more psychologically oriented social <b>rewards</b> are more effective, because they invoke adherence to descriptive and injunctive social norms. We investigated this by measuring electricity use for 13 {{weeks at a}} Dutch firm. Each week, employees were <b>rewarded</b> for conserving energy. They either received monetary <b>rewards</b> (€ 0 -€ 5) or social <b>rewards</b> (grade points with a descriptive comment). <b>Rewards</b> were either private or public. In both the short and long term, public <b>rewards</b> outperformed private <b>rewards,</b> and social <b>rewards</b> outperformed monetary <b>rewards.</b> This suggests that private monetary <b>rewards,</b> although popular, may be ineffective. Instead, public social <b>rewards</b> {{may be a more}} promising approach to stimulating energy conservation. Such social <b>rewards</b> do not crowd out intrinsic motivation, have less need for large-scale institutions or exogenous funding, and work regardless of who is paying the energy bill. Thus, we argue that the social norms approach should be considered more frequently as a valuable tool in the intervention tool-kit, especially when focusing on low-cost environmental behavior...|$|R
5000|$|Using <b>rewards</b> as {{motivators}} divides employee motivation {{into two}} categories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.

5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a <b>reward</b> and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as the <b>reward</b> is not being flaunted. Having the <b>reward</b> present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the <b>reward</b> will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E

40|$|Payment card <b>rewards</b> {{programs}} {{have become increasingly}} popular in the United States. But do consumers really benefit from <b>rewards?</b> In the United States, <b>rewards</b> are paid for primarily by the fees charged to merchants, and merchants may pass on the fees to consumers as higher retail prices. Further, some regulators and analysts claim that <b>rewards</b> may send consumers distorted price signals, which in turn may lead consumers to choose payment methods that are less efficient to society.; Card networks and merchants have taken opposing sides in the <b>rewards</b> debate. Card networks claim their fee structures, including <b>rewards,</b> are crucial to achieving the right balance between merchant acceptance and consumer usage of their cards. <b>Rewards</b> can also reduce the total costs to society by inducing more consumers to switch from costly payment methods, such as checks, to less costly payment cards. Merchants benefit as well, they claim, because <b>rewards</b> card users make higher-value transactions than other consumers. Finally, more generous <b>rewards</b> are even more beneficial to consumers because they receive more as they make more card transactions.; Merchants, on the other hand, claim they pay for the <b>rewards</b> through their fees to card issuers. They argue that competitive pressures and customer expectations prevent them from rejecting cards even though the fees outweigh their benefits. They reject the idea that accepting <b>rewards</b> cards is profitable despite the higher fees. Instead, they argue that customers with <b>rewards</b> cards spend more than those without <b>rewards</b> cards simply because their incomes are higher—not because they receive more <b>rewards.</b> Finally, they argue that more generous <b>rewards</b> actually harm consumers, because higher fees to merchants lead to higher prices for goods and services.; Hayashi seeks to provide insight into these issues by considering whether current <b>rewards</b> programs benefit consumers and society. While definitive answers await further data, the analysis in this article suggests that the currently provided payment card <b>rewards</b> programs, especially credit card <b>rewards</b> programs, {{are not likely to}} be efficient. Further, <b>rewards</b> may potentially be too generous, lowering overall consumer welfare. ...|$|R
5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later <b>reward</b> that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate <b>reward.</b> The subjective value of a <b>reward</b> can also stem from the way one describes the potential <b>reward.</b> As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse.

5|$|On 6 November 2005, Octopus Cards Limited {{launched}} Octopus Rewards, {{a program}} that allows cardholders to earn rewards at merchants that are partners in the program. Participating merchants provide consumers with tailor-made offers and privileges. The rewards that the program offers are {{in the form of}} points, or <b>reward</b> dollars, stored on the card. Once a card is registered for the program, the cardholder may accumulate <b>reward</b> points by making purchases at participating merchants, and payments may be made in the form of cash, credit cards, or Octopus cards themselves. The rate at which <b>reward</b> points are earned per dollar-amount purchase differs by the merchant at which that the purchases are made. At Wellcome, for example, one point is earned for every purchase of HK$200; and at Watsons, points are earned at a rate of 0.5 percent per dollar amount of a purchase. Once these <b>reward</b> dollars are accumulated, they may be redeemed as payment for purchases at partner merchants for at least HK$1 per <b>reward</b> dollar. To redeem the accumulated <b>reward</b> dollars, cardholders must use the entire value amount in whole, and may not elect to use it partially. If the purchase price is lower than the amount of <b>reward</b> dollars available, the amount difference remains stored on the card. Founding partners for the Octopus Rewards program include HSBC, UA Cinemas and Wellcome.|$|E

5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the <b>reward</b> and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the <b>reward.</b> Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a <b>reward</b> of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the <b>reward</b> and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). Declines in self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E
5|$|Compared to neurotypical children, {{those with}} ADHD {{generally}} demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by <b>reward</b> immediacy and quality more {{than by the}} frequency of <b>reward</b> and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through {{the implementation of a}} simple self-control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the <b>reward,</b> and the delay is gradually increased. One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD. In another study, 3 children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer <b>reward</b> rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation {{of the quality of the}} reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference.|$|E

5|$|Evidence from {{microelectrode}} recordings {{from the}} brains of animals shows that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra are strongly activated by {{a wide variety of}} rewarding events. These reward-responsive dopamine neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra are crucial for reward-related cognition and serve as the central component of the <b>reward</b> system.The brain <b>reward</b> circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner....The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying <b>reward</b> and memory of <b>reward.</b> As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to <b>reward</b> prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within <b>reward</b> circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}} The function of dopamine varies in each axonal projection from the VTA and substantia nigra; for example, the VTA–nucleus accumbens shell projection assigns incentive salience ("want") to rewarding stimuli and its associated cues, the VTA–orbitofrontal cortex projection updates the value of different goals in accordance with their incentive salience, the VTA–amygdala and VTA–hippocampus projections mediate the consolidation of reward-related memories, and both the VTA–nucleus accumbens core and substantia nigra–dorsal striatum pathways are involved in learning motor responses that facilitate the acquisition of rewarding stimuli. Some activity within the VTA dopaminergic projections appears to be associated with <b>reward</b> prediction as well.|$|E
