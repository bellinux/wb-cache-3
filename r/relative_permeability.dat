Our study is motivated by the observation that capillary end effects documented in two-phase laboratory-scale experiments can significantly influence permeability estimates. While numerical simulations of two-phase flows in reconstructed pore-spaces are increasingly employed to characterize <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities,</b> a phenomenon which is akin to capillary end effects can also arise in such analyses due to the constraints applied at {{the boundaries of the}} computational domain. We profile the relative strength of these capillary end effects on the calculation of steady-state <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities</b> obtained within randomly generated porous micro-structures using a finite volume-based two-phase flow solver.

40|$|International audienceWhile it is {{generally}} assumed that in the viscous flow regime, the two-phase flow <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities</b> in fractured and porous media depend uniquely on the phase saturations, several {{studies have shown that}} for non-Darcian flows (i. e., where the inertial forces are not negligible compared with the viscous forces), the <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities</b> not only depend on phase saturations but also on the flow regime. Experimental results on inertial single- and two-phase flows in two transparent replicas of real rough fractures are presented and modeled combining a generalization of the single-phase flow Darcy's law with the apparent permeability concept. The experimental setup was designed to measure injected fluid flow rates, pressure drop within the fracture, and fluid saturation by image processing. For both fractures, single-phase flow experiments were modeled by means of the full cubic inertial law which allowed the determination of the intrinsic hydrodynamic parameters. Using these parameters, the apparent permeability of each fracture was calculated {{as a function of the}} Reynolds number, leading to an elegant means to compare the two fractures in terms of hydraulic behavior versus flow regime. Also, a method for determining the experimental transition flow rate between the weak inertia and the strong inertia flow regimes is proposed. Two-phase flow experiments consisted in measuring the pressure drop and the fluid saturation within the fractures, for various constant values of the liquid flow rate and for increasing values of the gas flow rate. Regardless of the explored flow regime, two-phase flow <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities</b> were calculated as the ratio of the single phase flow pressure drop per unit length divided by the two-phase flow pressure drop per unit length, and were plotted versus the measured fluid saturation. Results confirm the dependence of the <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities</b> on the flow regime. Also the proposed generalization of Darcy's law shows that the <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities</b> versus fluid saturation follow physical meaningful trends for different liquid and gas flow rates.

40|$|The {{study of}} water and gas {{transport}} through fibrous gas diffusion layer (GDL) {{is important to the}} optimization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, analytical models of dimensionless permeability, and water and gas <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of fibrous GDL in PEMFCs are derived using fractal theory. In our models, the structure of fibrous GDL is characterized in terms of porosity, tortuosity fractal dimension (D-T), pore area fractal dimensions (d(f)), water phase (d(f,w)) and gas phase (d(f,g)) fractal dimensions. The predicted dimensionless permeability, water and gas <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities</b> based on the proposed models are in good agreement with experimental data and predictions of numerical simulations reported in the literature. The model reveals that, although water phase and gas phase fractal dimensions strongly depend on porosity, the water and gas <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities</b> are independent of porosity and are a function of water saturation only. It is also shown that the dimensionless permeability decreases significantly with the increase of tortuosity fractal dimension. On the other hand, there is only a small decrease in the water and gas <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities</b> when tortuosity fractal dimension increases. One advantage of the proposed analytical model is that it contains no empirical constant, which is normally required in past models. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relative}} {{role of the}} complex pore space geometry and wettability of the solid matrix on the quantification of <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of elementary cells of porous media. These constitute a key element upon which upscaling frameworks are typically grounded. In our study we focus on state immiscible two-phase flow taking place at the scale of elementary cells. Pressure-driven two-phase flow following simultaneous co-current injection of water and oil is numerically solved for a suite of regular and stochastically generated two-dimensional explicit elementary cells with fixed porosity and sharing main topological/morphological features. We show that the <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of the randomly generated elementary cells are significantly influenced by the formation of preferential percolation paths, called principal pathways, giving rise to a strongly nonuniform distribution of fluid fluxes. These pathways {{are a result of}} the spatially variable resistance that the random pore structures exert on the fluid.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a conceptual and numerical model of multiphase flow in fractures. The void space of real rough-walled rock fractures is conceptualized as a two-dimensional heterogeneous porous medium, characterized by aperture {{as a function}} of position in the fracture plane. Portions of a fracture are occupied by wetting and nonwetting phase, respectively, according to local capillary pressure and accessibility criteria. Phase occupancy and permeability are derived by assuming a parallel-plate approximation for suitably small subregions in the fracture plane. For log-normal aperture distributions, a simple approximation to fracture capillary pressure is obtained in closed form; it is found to resemble the typical shape of Leverett's j-function. Wetting and non-wetting phase <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities</b> are calculated by numerically simulating single phase flows separately in the wetted and non-wetted pore spaces. Illustrative examples indicate that <b>relative</b> <b>permeabilities</b> depend sensitively on the nature and range of spatial correlation between apertures.
