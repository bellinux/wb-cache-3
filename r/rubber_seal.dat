The first time was for losing a <b>rubber</b> <b>seal</b> in the 37-inch cyclotron which prevented its use in a demonstration to a potential donor. He was later rehired at Luis Alvarez's urging, but melted an expensive pair of pliers while welding, and was fired again. Though offered his job back, he decided instead to go to Princeton University to work with Henry DeWolf Smyth.|$|E

25|$|An annular blowout {{preventer}} {{is a large}} valve that uses a wedge to seal off a wellhead. It has a donut-like <b>rubber</b> <b>seal,</b> known as an elastomeric packing unit, reinforced with steel ribs. During drilling or well interventions, the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the wellbore and threaten the rig. The annular {{blowout preventer}} was invented by Granville Sloan Knox in 1946 who received a patent on September 9, 1952.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the suitability use of vegetable-based oil in hydraulic system and the compatibility between the <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> and lubricant extracted from vegetable-based oil in hydraulic system. Two types of o-ring <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> were used which are VITON and NBR. These <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> were fully immersed in {{two different types of}} oil, Seri Murni Palm Olein and Pennzoil 68 Hydraulic Oil for two months. Detailed analysis of the <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> mass, thickness and perimeter, swelling test, SEM and oxidation test were done during the period in order to investigate the dimensional and structural changes of <b>rubber</b> <b>seals.</b> The viscosities of immersed oil were also tested to analyze its impact and influence on the physical changes of seals. The analysis was done using the ASTM standard method. Result shows that the Seri Murni Palm Olein {{has the potential to be}} used as hydraulic fluid especially when using with VITON seal. However, some of physical and its chemical properties need to be enhanced first such adding additives to the olein in order to improve the effectiveness of the vegetable-based oil as hydraulic fluid.

25|$|The {{original}} {{and still a}} commonly practised form of hydrogenation in teaching laboratories, this process is usually effected by adding solid catalyst to a round bottom flask of dissolved reactant which has been evacuated using nitrogen or argon gas and sealing the mixture with a penetrable <b>rubber</b> <b>seal.</b> Hydrogen gas is then supplied from a H2-filled balloon. The resulting three phase mixture is agitated to promote mixing. Hydrogen uptake can be monitored, which can be useful for monitoring progress of a hydrogenation. This is achieved by either using a graduated tube containing a coloured liquid, usually aqueous copper sulfate or with gauges for each reaction vessel.|$|E
25|$|In home canning, food {{is packed}} into a jar, and the steel lid {{is placed on}} top of the jar with the {{integral}} <b>rubber</b> <b>seal</b> resting {{on the rim of the}} jar. The band is screwed loosely over the lid, which will allow air and steam to escape. By far, though, the most popular form of seal was the screw-on zinc cap, the precursor to today's screw-on lids. The earliest glass jars were called wax sealers, because they used sealing wax, which was poured into a channel around the lip that held on a tin lid. The earliest successful application of this was discovered by John Landis Mason and patented on November 30, 1858, a date embossed on millions of jars for food preservation and pickling.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the high}} temperature, high {{pressure}} and high corrosive {{environment of the}} oil and gas drilling downhole, the weatherability of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> material has a great influence on the production safety. In order to study the important degree of every key environmental factor in downhole influencing the <b>sealing</b> performance of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> material, a new device of simulating downhole environment is designed to test the permeability of O-ring. The sample is hydrogenated nitrile O-ring and orthogonal experiment method is used to do nine tests by getting three levels from temperature, pressure and CO 2 volume fraction. Test adopts fuzzy orthogonal method to analyze the main effects and the interaction between two factors, taking tensile strength, diameter variety rate and pH value of indicator as evaluation index. The results show that: the environmental factor influencing the sealing performance of hydrogenated nitrile O-ring from high to low by turns is temperature, pressure and CO 2 volume fraction, while the interaction between temperature and pressure is the most significant. It provides a new way to study the influence of downhole complex environment on the performance of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> material. Moreover, the results have important reference value to further study the failure mechanism of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> ring in many environmental factors and the rational use in engineering...|$|R

40|$|The {{preoperative}} opacification of acrylic {{intraocular lenses}} (IOLs) {{was investigated in}} order to determine its cause. Opacified IOLs were examined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), the buffer solutions were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and the <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> used in the bottles in which the IOLs were stored were ashed and tested. The deposit covering the opacified lenses contained a significant amount of zinc, which was absent from fresh IOLs and buffer solution. The source of this was found to be the <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> used to seal the glass bottles in which the IOLs were stored. There were two types of <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> used, red and grey in colour. The buffer solutions in which opacification had occurred was also contaminated with zinc, but this was only noticeable when using the red seals. This contamination was reproduced by boiling red seals in fresh buffer solution for eighty minutes, to simulate autoclaving. It was concluded that zinc from the zinc oxide used as filler in the <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> was leaching into the buffer solution and causing the IOLs to become opacified. This was found to be much worse {{in the case of the}} red seals than for the grey ones. However, minute crystals were found on the IOLs stored using the grey ones, which could potentially act as nucleation points for postoperative opacification...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSealing {{clearance}} is a {{key factor}} for a metal <b>rubber</b> <b>sealâ€™s</b> sealability. The expansion coefficient and expansion deformation in the radial direction of metal rubber have been obtained through a thermal expansion experiment of metal rubber.

By combining the temperature and elasticity factors of metal rubber with the elastic mechanics theory, the calculation formula of the sealing clearance has been derived, and {{the values of the}} sealing clearance and the leakage rate in certain working conditions have been calculated. Experimental results are consistent with calculation results in a high degree.
