40|$|Clatter and <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> is an {{increasing}} challenge {{for the development of}} low-noise transmissions. Efforts to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions of combustion engines combined with a decrease of the idle speed cause increasing cyclic irregularities within modern drivelines which result in {{an increasing}} clatter and <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> and can even lead to serious damage of driveline components. Beside these aspects, the improvement of transmission efficiency as part of the powertrain efficiency and therefore fuel consumption of the vehicle is a major task during {{the development of a new}} transmission. In order to design future transmissions that implicate improvements on both tasks simultaneously, new grounds were broken by the Institute of Machine Components (IMA) of the University of Stuttgart, Germany in the field of clatter and <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> free automotive transmissions. This is achieved in principle by decoupling all gears which are not in the power flow. On the basis of a patented solution named CARF-Transmission, the Clatter And <b>Rattle</b> <b>noise</b> Free transmission is presented as well as derived developments.

Predicting and improving the seat BSR noise in early design phase is still challenging.

Here, it is shown that there is a strong link between the seat structural dynamics and the seat <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> so that the seat <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> can be predicted and controlled from the seat structural analysis in early design phase.

This makes it possible to measure clutch dynamic torque by using a small-size magnetic sensor. We install a small-size magnetic sensor on the input shaft of the transmission and measure the relative angular displacement between clutch hub and disc plate. We can obtain the clutch torque correspond to the angular displacement in the clutch torsional characteristics test. The object of this research is to measure clutch dynamic torque on real vehicle condition.

The noise produced by specific components and mechanisms in the engine can play a significant role in determining the perceived quality of the overall noise and in turn the perceived quality of the engine. The goal of the present research is to characterize the sounds produced by the phenomenon known as gear rattle and to develop a model that can be used to assess gear rattle levels in a way that connects directly with human perception of rattle. Most previous work in this area has been focused on rating the overall sound quality of diesel engines, but little has been done to develop models of perception of <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> in particular. Various engine recordings in which gear rattle was present were first compiled. These signals were analyzed to identify how sounds changed with increased levels of rattle. A method to simulate gear <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> and incorporate it into a no-gear-rattle (baseline) recording was developed. This procedure enabled controlled variation of rattle for use in a psychoacoustic test. The test was designed to quantify detectable levels, perception of growth, and increases in annoyance due to the presence of gear <b>rattle</b> <b>noise.</b> The responses of people who reported having experience with diesel engines were compared with those of a more general population. The subjects with diesel engine experience were found to be better at detecting gear <b>rattle</b> <b>noise.</b> The outcome of this research will be a method to predict how people perceive gear <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> so that component noise targets can be set that directly relate to human perception of gear rattle. When coupled with noise generation predictions, this approach can be used to optimize the quality of the component noise. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{noise and}} {{vibration}} of a poor automotive seat aggravate the interior cabin noise and discomfort. The automotive seat structural {{noise and vibration}} {{is caused by the}} transmission of the power train or road vibration into the seat. The characterization of seat structural dynamics behavior in early design phase assists to effectively improve the NVH quality of the seat. The seat nonlinear buzz, squeak, and <b>rattle</b> (BSR) <b>noise</b> are the major issues which are directly linked to the NVH quality of the vehicle. For this purpose, a practical CAE (computer-aided engineering) concept modeling method is introduced and developed for full BIW (body-in-white) and seat separately. Here, the seat concept model is employed to allow designing the seat structure modifications as well as examining the effects of the modifications on the <b>rattle</b> <b>noise.</b> Comparisons {{of the results of the}} simulation and experiment validate the developed seat CAE model. Three modifications are proposed to optimize the dynamics of the seat structure to prevent the seat <b>rattle</b> <b>noise.</b> These modifications are designed to shift or decrease the seat torsion resonance and vibration level, respectively. The results verified that by modification the seat structural dynamics, the nonlinear events such as <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> and in general BSR noise can be reduced or controlled accordingly...|$|R

For validation purposes, a specific instrumentation of a gearbox is set up. The relative speed of the unloaded meshing gears is observed by means of optical encoders to directly detect the instants of impact which then serve as a basis for validation of the non-intrusive detection method proposed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Component {{sound quality}} is an {{important}} factor in the design of competitive diesel engines. One component noise that causes complaints is the gear rattle that originates in the front-of-engine gear train which drives the fuel pump and other accessories. The rattle is caused by repeated tooth impacts resulting from fluctuations in differential torsional acceleration of the driving gears. These impacts generate a broadband, impulsive noise that is often perceived as annoying. In most previous work, the overall sound quality of diesel engines has been considered without specifically focusing on predicting the perception of gear rattle. Gear rattle level has been quantified based on angular acceleration measurements, but those measurements can be difficult to perform. Here, the emphasis was on developing a metric based on subjective testing of the perception of gear rattle. In the first part of the present work, a method to simulate gear <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> and incorporate it into a no-gear-rattle (baseline) recording was developed. That procedure enabled controlled variation of rattle within the total engine noise signal. The simulations were then used in a psychoacoustic test that was designed to quantify detectable levels, perception of growth, and increase in annoyance due to the presence of gear <b>rattle</b> <b>noise.</b> Forty subjects participated in the threshold detection tests and a paired comparison annoyance test. The responses of people who reported having experience with diesel engines were compared to those of a more general population.
