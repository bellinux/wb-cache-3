5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of poisoning by A. ocreata are initially gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea and vomiting which may lead to dehydration and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid-base disturbances. The initial symptoms resolve {{two to three days}} after ingestion of the fungus. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substances in the blood. <b>Renal</b> <b>failure</b> (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic renal damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, pancreatitis, acute <b>renal</b> <b>failure,</b> and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{growing number}} of {{patients}} are returning to dialysis after <b>renal</b> transplant <b>failure.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to determine whether peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a safe and good treatment option for these patients. METHODS: All patients returning to PD or haemodialysis (HD) after <b>renal</b> transplant <b>failure</b> before 1 October 2002 at the University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium, were evaluated. Data were collected until death, retransplantation (reTx), transfer to HD or PD or until 1 January 2003. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients starting PD (PDpostTx-group) and 39 patients starting HD (HDpostTx-group) after <b>renal</b> transplant <b>failure</b> were included in the study. There were no significant differences in age, sex, serum albumin- and CRP-levels at baseline. The total time on renal replacement therapy at transplant failure and time to transplant failure did not differ between the two groups either. Furthermore, the baseline comorbidity was similar in both groups. During follow-up, the outcome did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, there was a tendency towards higher patient survival and reTx tended to be more frequent in the PDpostTx-group. Moreover, patients in the HDpostTx-group tended to accrue more new comorbidity. The incidence of peritonitis and the evolution of dialysis adequacy (renal and peritoneal Kt/V and creatinine clearances) with time in the PDpostTx-group was similar to that seen in our centre's PD patients who had never undergone transplantation before. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the outcome in patients starting PD after <b>renal</b> transplant <b>failure</b> is at least as good as the outcome in those starting HD. Although these observational findings warrant further confirmation, PD therefore can be regarded as a safe and good treatment option for patients returning to dialysis after <b>renal</b> transplant <b>failure.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Hemodialysis {{has been}} carried out at Kyoto University Hospital since 1960. Before the opening of Artificial Kidney Unit, most of the {{patients}} died in a short term. The establishment of the above unit made regular dialysis treatment possible, and 98 patients have been treated from 1968 to 1977. 1) Age, sex and basic diseases have gradually changed for these ten years. At the present time, indication of hemodialysis is expanded to almost all of chronic <b>renal</b> <b>failures.</b> 2) Cumulative survival rate of 98 patients was calculated as follows: 77. 2 % at 5 years, 56 % at 8 years, and 40. 9 % at 10 years. 3) As to causes of death, uremia due to the under-dialysis was frequently seen in the beginning, but cerebro-vascular accident and infection has become the main causes since adoption of adequate dialysis in which BUN is maintained below 80 mg% and creatinine below 15 mg%. 4) Some of chronic <b>renal</b> <b>failures</b> are of postrenal origin. Urological examinations are required to rule out these causes. 5) As to blood access, the external A-V shunt was constructed mainly.

It has been the subject of much research, and many of its biologically active agents have been isolated.

Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women.
