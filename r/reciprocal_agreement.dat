25|$|Membership of the {{majority}} of consumers' co-operatives in the UK was brought under one identity in 2008 {{as a part of the}} launch of 'The Co-operative Brand' however each individual co-operative retains its own individual membership scheme. Members of these societies are given a card which all look very similar but which will list the specific co-op which the individual is a member of on the front. As a part of their membership schemes, many of the larger co-operatives which have adopted 'The Co-operative Brand' will allow members of other co-operatives to earn a share of their profits in a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>agreement.</b> This is particularly the case with those co-ops which have interests in supermarkets, whereas other users of the co-op brand, such as The Phone Co-op operate entirely independent membership schemes.|$|E
25|$|Boyd {{was more}} {{successful}} in the limited-overs McDonald's Cup, {{which at the time}} was played as a knockout competition. He took 10 wickets from four games, including the tournament's final, in which Western Australia defeated New South Wales. In the semi-final against Victoria, held in March 1983 at the WACA Ground, Boyd took match figures of 5/15 from seven overs, helping Western Australia bowl out Victoria for 112. Named man of the match, his performance was the first five-wicket haul taken at List A level for Western Australia, and remains the best bowling figures overall for the state. Failing to maintain his form over the following seasons, he played six further matches for Western Australia (three first-class and three limited-overs), all during the 1983–84 season. Boyd subsequently spent time playing cricket in England. After returning to Australia, he gained coaching certification from the Australian Cricket Board, and went on to serve as a coach in the Northern Territory. In 1990, he spent a period playing and coaching for the Johor Cricket Association in Malaysia, as part of a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Northern Territory Cricket Association.|$|E

25|$|Earl Richard {{was one of}} the Lords Appellant, {{the leaders}} of the baronial {{opposition}} to Richard II, and was executed in 1397. Burley's activities during these momentous events seems to have been entirely routine. In July 1397, immediately after Arundel's arrest, Burley was involved in some sort of deal with John Eyton that required a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>agreement</b> to pay each other a substantial £200 the next Michaelmas. Later in the year he is recorded taking recognizances as usual, including an undertaking from William Glover of Ludlow for £60. Business continued, with other smaller clients employing him, along with his usual colleagues. On 7 March 1398 he and Thomas Young were among the feoffees appointed by Isabel de Eylesford to deal with her manors of Brimfield, Herefordshire, and Buildwas, Shropshire: a licence to complete the business by reciprocally enfeoffing Isabel was not issued until April 1402, long after the looming power struggle had reached conclusion, and problems at Brimfield delayed completion until February 1403, by which time Isabel was remarried. Such legal complexities unfolded to an entirely different rhythm from politics. An almost adjacent entry in the Patent rolls for show of 4 Februarys how delicately the king, evidently worried by spreading disaffection, was handling Shropshire people affected by Arundel's attainder. In this case, in an issue that might have been initiated by Burley, the king ensured that an Oswestry brewer would not be out of pocket, as he had invested heavily in premises granted by Arundel. Burley's own position with the régime seems to have been little affected and he was reappointed as a justice of the peace on 16 September 1398, after a lapse of little more than a year: {{more or less the same}} interval as previously.|$|E

We provide in this paper an analytic framework for the study of <b>reciprocal</b> trade <b>agreements.</b> We use this framework to establish three main results. First, we argue that political-economy factors are important for explaining the range of trade policies observed, but that these factors can not explain why governments seek <b>reciprocal</b> trade <b>agreements</b> as an institutional form for implementing their preferred policies. Rather, whether or not governments are politically motivated, Johnson (1953 - 54) was right: The central purpose of a <b>reciprocal</b> trade <b>agreement</b> is to eliminate the terms-of-trade driven policies that arise in the absence of such an agreement. Second, we establish an economic interpretation of the principles of reciprocity and nondiscrimination that represent the foundation of postwar <b>reciprocal</b> trade <b>agreements.</b> Finally, we offer new insights regarding the treatment of export subsidies in <b>reciprocal</b> trade <b>agreements.</b> ...|$|R
