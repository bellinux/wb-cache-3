In this study, we use bootstrap confidence intervals to assess the effects of sample size on the reliable determination of roost size in the vulnerable Lesser Kestrel Falco naumanni overwintering at a large communal roost in South Africa. Using results from a unique five-season daily survey, we show that the currently recommended number of <b>replicate</b> <b>sample</b> counts (international action plan for the Lesser Kestrel) of three censuses per season is too low to reliably assess roost size. Bootstrap confidence intervals asymptote at 40 - 60 censuses per season, with 50 being the modal value. We recommend 50 censuses per season as the optimal sample size. We were also able to show that the population size of Lesser Kestrels at this roost significantly increased over each of the first four seasons of the study period and decreased slightly in the final season.

The literature supports applying the MHS method to <b>replicate</b> <b>sample</b> medians to estimate the sampling variance of a median. There are several computational advantages, however, to using grouped data to estimate medians, with linear interpolation being used within the grouped-data interval containing the median.

We analysed the standing stocks, diversity, and functional group and genus-level composition of macrofaunal nematodes at lower bathyal depths (3, 500 m water depth) in the Whittard Canyon system (NE Atlantic) and on the adjacent continental slope. Five <b>replicate</b> <b>sample</b> sets were obtained using a Megacorer, at four locations (three canyon branches, one slope). Sediment samples were processed on a 500 -?m mesh to provide both nematode and polychaete data from the same samples. The dominant nematode genera included Paramesacanthion, Metacylicolaimus, Cylicolaimus and Phanodermopsis. Nematode standing stocks (density and biomass) increased significantly from slope to canyon locations. Similarly, nematode dominance increased substantially (and diversity decreased) from slope to canyon locations. Nematode feeding groups and tail shape groups also appeared to exhibit common trends across study locations. Nematode genus-level faunal composition varied significantly between slope and canyon locations. We describe and discuss the broadly similar trends detected in the matching polychaete data, noting some differences in the polychaete density and diversity responses. We suggest that the similar trends in macrofaunal nematode and polychaete ecology across our four study locations reflect responses to both changing sedimentology and food availability...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{ecological}} interaction strengths {{is one of}} {{the main}} objectives of ecology. Recently, two methods for estimating interaction strengths of predator-prey interactions in nature have been proposed: a field observation approach proposed by Novak and Wootton (2008) and stable isotope analysis. The field observation method estimates feeding rates based on feeding observations, handling times and prey abundances. Stable isotope analysis estimates diet proportions using mixing models of ratios of heavy to light carbon and nitrogen isotopes in body tissues of predators and their prey. However, because these two methods are relatively new, few studies have been conducted to understand and contrast their estimates of interaction strengths. I sought to quantify the correlation between the estimates of interaction strength made by the two methods. Both methods were conducted simultaneously in a rocky intertidal community on the Oregon coast with the whelk Nucella ostrina as the focal predator and the barnacle Balanus glandula and the mussel Mytilus trossulus as the two primary prey species. I documented a non-significant and weak correlation between the two method’s estimates of interaction strength.

While such work is common in terrestrial systems, fewer examples exist in marine applications.

We employ simultaneous sampling using fish traps and novel underwater camera observations to generate the requisite <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> for occupancy models of red snapper, a reef fish species.

We found that detection probabilities tended to be higher for camera traps than traditional fish traps. Furthermore, camera trap detections were influenced by the current direction and turbidity of the water, indicating that collecting data on these variables is important for future monitoring. These models indicate that the distribution and abundance of this species is more heavily influenced by latitude and depth than by micro-scal...|$|R

The STAR-AQEM method requires the sub-sampling and taxonomic identification of at least one-sixth of the sample and at least 700 individuals.

Sub-sampling effects caused more than 50 % of the overall variance between <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> values for 12 of the 27 macroinvertebrate metrics analysed and was generally greatest for metrics that depend {{on the number of}} taxa present. The sampling precision of each metric was estimated by the overall <b>replicate</b> <b>sampling</b> variance as a percentage Psamp of the total variance in metric values within a stream type. Average over all stream types, the three Saprobic indices had the lowest percentage sampling variances with median values of only 3 – 6 %.

The <b>replicated</b> <b>sampling</b> of several reduced habitats at each seep allowed to elucidate the most important scale of turnover. The spatial scales included here range within habitat (centimeters, micro-scale), within a cold seep (10 s to 100 's of meters, meso-scale) and between different seeps (10 to 100 s of kilometers, macro-scale). The results show that a typical cold seep fauna was found in all reduced samples.

Carcass halves were imaged uncontaminated and cecal contents (10, 50, or 100 mg) were applied to the carcass half, and then re-imaged. Cecal detection results varied due to contaminate detection threshold. The imaging system correctly identified 100 % cecal mass applied at a threshold of 1. 00 and 1. 05 but also incorrectly identified 252 and 65 carcass features, respectively that were not contaminates (false positives). False negative were only associated with the 10 mg mass and a detection threshold of 1. 10.

The use of means from few <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> o overdispersed data as quantitative estimators of tick popu-lation density is in turn likely to lead to inaccurate interpretations which may be scientifically mislea-ding. In this paper ways of estimating overdispersion are listed and suggestions for the use of correct statistical tests for handling overdispersed data are given...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 8335 Five <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> were {{collected}} from five exposed stony shoreline sites in three low, mid and high alkalinity lakes within a narrow temporal window {{in order to assess}} the spatial variation in littoral invertebrate communities Five <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> from five stony shoreline sites in one lake of each alkalinity type {{were collected}} over three seasons to assess temporal variability. All samples were collected using a 2 minute kick sweep method with a 670 ? mesh pond net, preserved in situ in 70 % alcohol and subsequently sorted and identified to the lowest level of taxonomic resolution practicable. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS), cluster analysis and TWINSPAN classification methods were used to examine the potential for using the littoral invertebrate fauna to differentiate among sites, among lakes, among seasons and among alkalinity types. Given that the underlying structure in the data was known, the efficacy of three common classification methods was assessed. The effect of sampling effort and the influence of rare species on the classification of biological invertebrate samples were also examined...|$|R
