40|$|AbstractEnormous {{issues on}} {{research}} integrity {{have been widely}} discussed amongst the academicians and the research institutes all over the world. Likewise, understanding and discussions on different aspects of academic misconducts have increased significantly in the past decade. Yet, cases on <b>research</b> <b>misconducts</b> continue to increase {{in the world of}} academia. Additionally, a noticeable gap in the literature is evident, whereby little research has sought to address <b>research</b> <b>misconducts</b> among researchers in Malaysia and the existence of policies on <b>research</b> <b>misconducts</b> among universities are not well documented or governed. In considering the integrity in research among the researchers, the authors examine {{the extent to which they}} perceive research integrity through <b>research</b> <b>misconducts</b> (i. e. plagiarism, fabrication, falsification, misuse of research fund). The authors further address on the influence of different generations and gender of researchers towards integrity. A cross-sectional survey of 600 questionnaires was used and only 159 returned questionnaires were analyzed. The use of parametric test reveals that majority of respondents agreed <b>research</b> <b>misconducts</b> were not tolerable. The study also confirms that generations and gender differences influence the researchers’ perceptions towards integrity. The study concludes that Malaysia's academic communities require strong and sound guidelines for responsible practice in research and dealing with <b>research</b> <b>misconducts</b> specifically...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} three decades {{publication}} of papers in different fields of agronomic sciences have been increased drastically in Iran. However, there is growing warnings about <b>research</b> <b>misconducts.</b> To get a quantitative insight into the commitment to the research ethics, 1269 papers published during the last 3 decades in the refereed domestic journals were surveyed using human tools. The frequency of different type of misconducts were calculated and compared statistically. The results indicated that overlap in title, the target crop, experimental factors (treatments) and the measured traits was occurred with frequency of 26 % among the surveyed papers which was categorized as unauthorized adoption of ideas. Falsification and fabrication was distinguished based on the coefficient of variation (CV), probability of type I error and discrepancy between the results of ANOVA and regression analysis. This type of misconducts had frequency of 6 %. However, plagiarism had a significantly higher frequency and was detected in up to 12 % of the papers. The frequency of all type of misconducts was significantly higher in the papers where the corresponding authors were students compared to the papers published by scientific staffs of universities/research institutes. Overall <b>research</b> <b>misconducts</b> were distinguished in 16 % of papers and were most frequent in the 1380 decade compared to 60 ’s and 70 ’s. It seems that lack of awareness about the principles of research ethics is the main cause of the prevalence of the observed misconducts. Therefore, development of a national code of ethics is of high priority for the national agricultural research system in the country...|$|R
25|$|In general, {{defining}} {{whether an}} individual is guilty of misconduct requires a detailed investigation by the individual's employing academic institution. Such investigations require detailed and rigorous processes and can be extremely costly. Furthermore, the more senior the individual under suspicion, {{the more likely it}} is that conflicts of interest will compromise the investigation. In many countries (with the notable exception of the United States) acquisition of funds on the basis of fraudulent data is not a legal offence and there is consequently no regulator to oversee investigations into alleged <b>research</b> <b>misconduct.</b> Universities therefore have few incentives to investigate allegations in a robust manner, or act on the findings of such investigations if they vindicate the allegation.|$|E

40|$|In {{management}} academic research, academic advancement, job security, {{and securing}} of research {{funds in the}} university are judged mainly by the outputs of publications in high impact journals. With bogus resume filled with published journal articles, the university and other allied institutions are keen to recruit or sustain the appointment of such academics. This often leads to undue pressure on {{the parts of the}} intending academics or those already recruited to engage in <b>research</b> <b>misconducts.</b> This structured review therefore focuses on the ethics and integrity issues in management research via the analysis of retracted articles within a period of 2005 - 2016. This study employs a literature review methodology. In 2017, the database (Crossref and Google scholar) of retracted articles published between 2005 and 2016 in the field of management science were searched by using Boolean strings such as retracted articles in management, notice of retraction in management science, research ethics, and plagiarism in management research. The searched articles were subsequently streamlined by choosing the articles based on their relevance and content in accordance with the inclusion criteria. Based on the analyzed retracted articles, the study shows that there are evidences of unethical issues among researchers in management science. The unethical issues identifies include data falsification, duplication of submitted articles, plagiarism, data irregularities and incomplete citations. Interestingly, the analyzed results indicate that knowledge management has the highest number of retracted articles with plagiarism as the predominant ethical issues. Also, the findings from this study indicated that unethical misconducts are not restricted to a particular geographical location but cut across different countries.
