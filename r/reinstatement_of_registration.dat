Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873–1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} {{the transfer of}} training {{as it relates to}} mandatory continuing education for the radiologic technologist. Through continuing education the technologists ' satisfy their requirements for recertification and/or licensure. Continuing education should provide a method to maintain competency, however, attitudes determine the success of learning outcomes. The Professional Licensing Report of 1998 states, “more licensing boards in more states than ever are requiring continuing education classes of their licensees (as cited in Duerhring and Ward, 2001, p. 2). Licensing is a means by which the state has the authority to grant an individual permission to practice within that state. In radiology technology only 34 out of 50 states require state licensing for certification within that state. In 1991, the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists stated that it would begin implementing continuing education for renewal of registration of certificates. In 1995, continuing education became mandatory for renewal or <b>reinstatement</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration.</b> The American Registry of Radiologic Technologists defines registration as “the annual renewal of the certificate’s validity ” (2002). A certificate is given to an individual after completing al...|$|E

Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981), {{upholding}} the Constitutionality of requiring men but not women to register for the draft; Selective Service v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group (MPIRG), 468 U.S. 841 (1984), upholding the Constitutionality {{of the first of}} the federal [...] "Solomon Amendment" [...] laws, which requires applicants for Federal student aid to certify that they have complied with draft registration, either by having registered or by not being required to register; Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598 (1985), upholding the policies and procedures which the Supreme Court thought the government had used to select the [...] "most vocal" [...] nonregistrants for prosecution, after the government refused to comply with discovery orders by the trial court to produce documents and witnesses related to the selection of nonregistrants for prosecution; and Elgin v.

40|$|This book {{presents}} original {{research on}} the technical, financial and temporal implications <b>of</b> various flood <b>reinstatement</b> methods suitable for residential properties. It reports {{the findings of the}} first empirical study of this nature, a study funded by Lloyds TSB insurance company. With climate change and the development of property on flood plains, the flooding of buildings has become a considerable problem, both for property owners and their insurers. This book, based on extensive research, provides guidance on how to assess and repair flood damaged properties. CONTENTS: Introduction to flooding; Preparing for a flood; Flood characteristic; Drying out flooded building; <b>Reinstatement</b> <b>of</b> flood-damaged floors; <b>Reinstatement</b> <b>of</b> flood-damaged walls; <b>Reinstatement</b> <b>of</b> flood-damaged doors and windows; <b>Reinstatement</b> <b>of</b> flood-damaged utilities and fittings; Conclusions and summary.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{indicate that}} the dopamine [...] hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitors disulfiram and nepicastat suppress cocaine-primed <b>reinstatement</b> <b>of</b> cocaine self-administration behaviour. Moreover, both inhibitors increase dopamine release in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and markedly potentiate cocaine-induced dopamine release in this region. This study was aimed to clarify if the suppressant effect of DBH inhibitors on cocaine reinstatement was mediated by the high extracellular dopamine in the rat mPFC leading to a supra-maximal stimulation of D 1 receptors in the dorsal division of mPFC, an area critical for <b>reinstatement</b> <b>of</b> cocaine-seeking behaviour. In line with previous microdialysis studies in drug-naive animals, both DBH inhibitors potentiated cocaine-induced dopamine release in the mPFC, in the same animals in which they also suppressed <b>reinstatement</b> <b>of</b> cocaine seeking. Similar to the DBH inhibitors, L-DOPA potentiated cocaine-induced dopamine release in the mPFC and suppressed cocaine-induced <b>reinstatement</b> <b>of</b> cocaine-seeking behaviour. The bilateral microinfusion of the D 1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 into the dorsal mPFC not only prevented cocaine-induced <b>reinstatement</b> <b>of</b> cocaine seeking but also reverted both disulfiram- and L-DOPA-induced suppression <b>of</b> <b>reinstatement.</b> Moreover, the bilateral microinfusion of the D 1 receptor agonist chloro-APB (SKF 82958) into the dorsal mPFC markedly attenuated cocaine-induced <b>reinstatement</b> <b>of</b> cocaine seeking. These results suggest that stimulation of D 1 receptors in the dorsal mPFC {{plays a crucial role}} in cocaine-induced <b>reinstatement</b> <b>of</b> cocaine seeking, whereas the suppressant effect of DBH inhibitors and L-DOPA on drug-induced reinstatement is mediated by a supra-maximal stimulation of D 1 receptors leading to their inactivatio...|$|R
