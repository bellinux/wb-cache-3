5000|$|Although {{the region}} was {{populated}} already in Roman times, and the village of Monzingen was mentioned as a wine village as early as 778, the Nahe wine region was defined only with the 1971 German wine law. Before that, the wines were sold as plain [...] "Rhine wine". In recent decades, several Nahe producers have {{made a name for}} themselves with Riesling wines that have been rated very highly by international wine critics, and have come to be seen as being on par with the best wines of Moselle and <b>Rheingau</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The station {{opened on}} October 12, 1913. The eponymous square {{was named after}} the town of Rüdesheim am Rhein in Hesse, famous for its <b>Rheingau</b> <b>wines.</b> Willy Leitgebel {{constructed}} it like the nearby station Heidelberger Platz and Breitenbachplatz in a very pompous way.

Since then pictures are shown {{on the walls of}} the station. In 2005 the platform of the station was renovated again (new color, new floor) ...|$|E

At 118 booths, Rheingau and Wiesbaden vintners offer their wine and sparkling wine and invite to discover the already well known and favored, but also new vintages. Every year thousands of visitors use this opportunity to get acquainted with <b>Rheingau</b> Riesling <b>wines</b> and all their various facets and flavors. Regional specialities compatible with the wines are offered as well. A diversified musical program entertains the wine festival guests.

50|$|In 1975 Erwein Matuschka Greiffenclau {{took charge}} of the property, which was heavily in debt. Although an {{important}} figure in {{the emergence of a new}} or rediscovered style of high quality dry <b>Rheingau</b> <b>wine</b> in the 1980s and 1990s, he was not successful in reorganising his estate. When in 1997 the principal bank decided on the declaration of bankruptcy, Erwein, who was then also the chairman of the VDP-Rheingau, took his gun, went to his beloved vineyards, and committed suicide. Since then, the estate has belonged to the Nassauische Sparkasse bank, which runs the manor house as well as the vineyards and a restaurant.|$|R
25|$|Asher {{entered the}} wine {{industry}} in 1950, {{at the age}} of 18, when he took a part-time job assisting a wine retailer in Shepherd Market, between Curzon Street and Piccadilly in Mayfair, Central London. Within a year he had taken a full-time position with a small wine distributor, and by 1952 he was engaged by Blumenthal & Co, a major wine importer. Sponsored by Blumenthal, he attended tastings and lectures held by the Wine Trade Club at the Worshipful Company of Vintners in London, and in 1953 a scholarship allowed him to spend time working and studying in Jerez, the Spanish region that produces Sherry. Further such scholarships {{over the next two years}} despatched Asher to Burgundy in eastern France, then the <b>Rheingau</b> <b>wine</b> region in West Germany.|$|R
50|$|The Nahe wine region {{follows the}} path of the Nahe river in its northeasterly descent towards the Rhine. The river helps {{moderate}} the temperate climate of the region and the valleys of the Nahe's tributaries help foster diverse microclimates through the region. The Soonwald ranges to the northeast and rocky foothills to the east help retain heat and moderate the amount of rainfall that the region receives. Some south-facing vineyards have microclimates that are similar to a Mediterranean climate and are being experimented with for red wine grape cultivation. The Nahe flows parallel to the Moselle and lies 40 km to the southeast of the Mosel wine region. The Mittelrhein and <b>Rheingau</b> <b>wine</b> regions lie to the north/northeast with the Rheinhessen forming the region's eastern border. Vineyards are located on steep slopes along the Nahe and its tributaries typically at elevations of 100-300 meters (330-985 ft).|$|R
50|$|High-grade {{wines are}} grown in Kiedrich. The {{vineyards}} (or 'Weinlagen') Gräfenberg, Wasseros, Klosterberg, Sandgrub and Turmberg, {{and the larger}} wine-growing area ('Großlage') Heiligenstock {{are said to be}} the <b>Rheingau’s</b> top <b>wines.</b> The Kiedrich winemakers’ wine-growing tradition originates in the year 1480, when wine was already being grown by the winemaker’s house that is still exists today, under the name 'Adelsgut Langenhof'. The local winemakers’ cooperative has existed since 1893, making it the oldest in the Rheingau.|$|R
50|$|Nadine Poss (born 1991), from Windesheim in the German wine {{region of}} Nahe, {{was chosen as}} the 65th German Wine Queen on 13 Sep 2013 in Offenburg, as the {{successor}} to Julia Bertram from the Ahr wine region. She thus became the eighth German Wine Queen from the Nahe. The wine princesses during her twelve-month reign are Ramona Diegel (Rheinhessen) and Sabine Wagner (<b>Rheingau).</b> The German <b>Wine</b> Queen is traditionally crowned in the town of Neustadt an der Weinstraße. By exception that year the ceremony took place in Offenburg. The occasion was the 100th anniversary of the Baden Vintners' Association.|$|R
5000|$|Auslese (literal meaning: [...] "selected harvest"; plural form is Auslesen) is a German {{language}} wine {{term for}} a late harvest wine and is a riper category than Spätlese in the Prädikatswein category of the Austrian and German wine classification. The grapes are picked from selected very ripe bunches in the autumn (late November-early December), {{and have to be}} hand picked. Generally Auslese wine can be made in only the best harvest years that have been sufficiently warm. A small proportion of the grapes may be affected by noble rot in some regions although this never dominates the character of the <b>wine.</b> <b>Rheingau</b> winemaker Schloss Johannisberg is generally credited with discovering Auslese wine in 1787.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{consumer}} study was firstly to calculate the economic importance, in term of purchasing power, of visitors in the German <b>wine</b> growing region <b>Rheingau,</b> and secondly to examine their demographic and behavioural characteristics, {{as well as their}} the motivation using segmentation approach. In the framework of a face-to-face survey, conducted between April and May 2015, a total of 1, 555 tourists were interviewed at 18 different locations in the <b>Rheingau.</b> Four <b>wine</b> tourist types were identified by using cluster analysis: 1) <b>Wine</b> and <b>Rheingau</b> lovers, who have a high interest in wine and visit the region several times a year; 2) wine-oriented tourists, who use the culinary offerings of the Rheingau with pleasure but do not come to the region very often; 3) new visitors, who come to the region mainly because of the nature and history; and 4) foreign tourists, who have less knowledge about the Rheingau and buy less wine in the region. With the help of the purchasing power calculation, we can state that approximately 18 % of the total production is purchased directly in the region by tourists...|$|R
