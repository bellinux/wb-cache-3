Fight middle-aged and elderly women (range : 59 - 70 years old) and six young women (range : 22 - 29 years old) performed isokinetic knee and hip extension/ flexion training twice a week for 8 weeks at an angular velocity of 60 sec (5 repetitions set : 2 sets day), 240 /sec (10 repetitions set : 2 sets clay) and 120 sec (5 repetitions set : 2 sets day) using isokinetic dynamometer. The maximum voluntary strength was determined as the one repetition maximum for isotonic knee extension exercise. MRI was used to determine the muscle volume of quadriceps lemons (QF) muscles. As an index of muscle recruitment, relative activated crosssectional area (%-actCSA) of the QF muscles, which represented an area greater than the resting T 2 + 1 SD in MRI pixels, was calculated at rest and immediately after knee extension exercise based on T 2 -weighted MR images. The isotonic strength, muscle volume, and %-actCSA of QF muscles were measured before and after 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of resistance training. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine which factors (recruitment or hypertrophy) contributed to strength gain at the measured each period. As a result, the muscle <b>recruitment</b> <b>factor</b> played a major role in strength gain in the early phase of resistance training in both groups and then the muscle hypertrophic factor gradually dominated over the muscle <b>recruitment</b> <b>factor</b> in the contribution to the strength gain in both groups.

40|$|Immune-regulated {{pathways}} influence multiple {{aspects of}} cancer development. In {{this article we}} demonstrate that both macrophage abundance and T-cell abundance in breast cancer represent prognostic indicators for recurrence-free and overall survival. We provide evidence that response to chemotherapy is in part regulated by these leukocytes; cytotoxic therapies induce mammary epithelial cells to produce monocyte/macrophage <b>recruitment</b> <b>factors,</b> including colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF 1) and interleukin- 34, which together enhance CSF 1 receptor (CSF 1 R) -dependent macrophage infiltration. Blockade of macrophage recruitment with CSF 1 R-signaling antagonists, in combination with paclitaxel, improved survival of mammary tumor-bearing mice by slowing primary tumor development and reducing pulmonary metastasis. These improved aspects of mammary carcinogenesis were accompanied by decreased vessel density and appearance of antitumor immune programs fostering tumor suppression in a CD 8 (+) T-cell-dependent manner. These data provide a rationale for targeting macrophage recruitment/response pathways, notably CSF 1 R, in combination with cytotoxic therapy, and identification of a breast cancer population likely to benefit from this novel therapeutic approach. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings reveal that response to chemotherapy is in part regulated by the tumor immune microenvironment and that common cytotoxic drugs induce neoplastic cells to produce monocyte/macrophage <b>recruitment</b> <b>factors,</b> which in turn enhance macrophage infiltration into mammary adenocarcinomas. Blockade of pathways mediating macrophage recruitment, in combination with chemotherapy, significantly decreases primary tumor progression, reduces metastasis, and improves survival by CD 8 (+) T-cell-dependent mechanisms, thus indicating that the immune microenvironment of tumors can be reprogrammed to instead foster antitumor immunity and improve response to cytotoxic therapy.

40|$|Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a {{surveillance}} pathway that recognizes and rapidly degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTC). The {{strength of the}} NMD response appears to reflect multiple determinants on a target mRNA. We have previously reported that mRNAs containing PTCs {{in close proximity to}} the translation initiation codon (AUG-proximal PTCs) can substantially evade NMD. Here, we explore the mechanistic basis for this NMD resistance. We demonstrate that translation termination at an AUG-proximal PTC lacks the ribosome stalling that is evident in an NMD-sensitive PTC. This difference is associated with demonstrated interactions of the cytoplasmic poly(A) -binding protein 1, PABPC 1, with the cap-binding complex subunit, eIF 4 G and the 40 S <b>recruitment</b> <b>factor</b> eIF 3 as well as the ribosome release factor, eRF 3.

The purified MCAF showed microheterogeneity yielding two bands on SDS-PAGE analysis. Fibrosarcoma-derived MCAF specifically competed with THP- 1 (a human monocytic cell line) -derived 125 I-labeled MCAF in binding to human PBMC, whereas a similar basic heparin-binding leukocyte chemoattractant, IL- 8, did not.

It is unclear how this complex binds microtubules and how the proteins in the complex interact with one another. TACC 3 and clathrin have each been proposed to be the spindle <b>recruitment</b> <b>factor.</b> We have mapped the interactions within the complex and show that TACC 3 and clathrin were interdependent for spindle recruitment, having to interact in order for either to be recruited to the spindle. The N-terminal domain of clathrin and the TACC domain of TACC 3 in tandem made a microtubule interaction surface, coordinated by TACC 3 -clathrin binding. A dileucine motif and Aurora A-phosphorylated serine 558 on TACC 3 bound to the "ankle" of clathrin.

40|$|ABSTRACT Mitochondrial fission is {{mediated}} by the dynamin-related protein Drp 1 in meta-zoans. Drp 1 is recruited from the cytosol to mitochondria by the mitochondrial outer mem-brane protein Mff. A second mitochondrial outer membrane protein, named Fis 1, was previ-ously proposed as <b>recruitment</b> <b>factor,</b> but Fis 1 −/ − cells have mild or no mitochondrial fission defects. Here we show that Fis 1 is nevertheless part of the mitochondrial fission complex in metazoan cells. During the fission cycle, Drp 1 first binds to Mff {{on the surface of}} mitochon-dria, followed by entry into a complex that includes Fis 1 and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins at the ER–mitochondrial interface. Mutations in Fis 1 do not normally affect fission, but they can disrupt downstream degradation events when specific mitochondrial toxins are used to induce fission. The disruptions caused by mutations in Fis 1 lead to an accumulation of large LC 3 aggregates. We conclude that Fis 1 can act in sequence with Mff at the ER–mito-chondrial interface to couple stress-induced mitochondrial fission with downstream degrada-tion processes...|$|E

The recruitment of macrophages helps improve the clearing rate of myelin debris. The resident macrophages present in the nerves release further chemokines and cytokines to attract further macrophages. The degenerating nerve also produce macrophage chemotactic molecules. Another source of macrophage <b>recruitment</b> <b>factors</b> is serum. Delayed macrophage recruitment was observed in B-cell deficient mice lacking serum antibodies. These signaling molecules together cause an influx of macrophages, which peaks during the third week after injury. While Schwann cells mediate the initial stage of myelin debris clean up, macrophages come in to finish the job. Macrophages are facilitated by opsonins, which label debris for removal. The 3 major groups found in serum include complement, pentraxins, and antibodies. However, only complement has shown to help in myelin debris phagocytosis.|$|R

40|$|In trypanosomatids, uridylate {{residues}} are post-transcriptionally {{added to}} or deleted from pre-mRNAs during the complex process of RNA editing. Editing {{is carried out}} exclusively in the mitochondrion of these parasites and involves numerous proteins assembled into protein and ribonucleoprotein complexes. Previously we identified RNA-editing-associated protein - 1 (REAP- 1), an RNA binding protein found in the mitochondrion of Trypanosoma brucei.

40|$|Transcriptional coactivators that {{regulate}} {{the activity of}} human RNA polymerase III (Pol III) {{in the context of}} chromatin have not been reported. Here, we describe a completely defined in vitro system for transcription of a human tRNA gene assembled into a chromatin template. Transcriptional activation and histone acetylation in this system depend on recruitment of p 300 by general initiation factor TFIIIC, thus providing a new paradigm for recruitment of histone-modifying coactivators. Beyond its role as a chromatin-modifying factor, p 300 displays an acetyltransferase-independent function at the level of preinitiation complex assembly. Thus, direct interaction of p 300 with TFIIIC stabilizes binding of TFIIIC to core promoter elements and results in enhanced transcriptional activity on histone-free templates. Additional studies show that p 300 is recruited to the promoters of actively transcribed tRNA and U 6 snRNA genes in vivo. These studies identify TFIIIC as a <b>recruitment</b> <b>factor</b> for p 300 and thus may have important implications for the emerging concept that tRNA genes or TFIIIC binding sites act as chromatin barriers to prohibit spreading of silenced heterochromatin domains...|$|E
40|$|Telomeres recruit {{telomerase}} and differentiate chromosome ends from {{sites of}} DNA damage. Although the DNA damage checkpoint PI 3 -kinases ATM and ATR localize to telomeres and promote telomerase activation, activation of their downstream checkpoint pathway targets is inhibited. Here, {{we show that}} the fission yeast telomeric protein Ccq 1 is required for telomerase recruitment and inhibition of ATR target activation at telomeres. The loss of Ccq 1 results in progressive telomere shortening and persistent ATR-dependent activation of Chk 1. Unlike the checkpoint activation that follows loss of telomerase, this checkpoint activation occurs prior to detectable levels of critically short telomeres. When ccq 1 Δ telomeres do become critically short, activated Chk 1 promotes an unusual homologous recombination-based telomere maintenance process. We find that the previously reported meiotic segregation defects of cells lacking Ccq 1 stem from its role in telomere maintenance rather than from a role in formation of the meiotic bouquet. These findings demonstrate {{the existence of a}} novel telomerase <b>recruitment</b> <b>factor</b> that also serves to suppress local checkpoint activation...|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus suis is an {{important}} bacterial swine pathogen and a zoonotic agent. Recently, two surface proteins of S. suis, Fhb and Fhbp, have been described for their capacity to bind factor H—a soluble complement regulatory protein that protects host cells from complement-mediated damages. Results obtained in this study showed {{an important}} role of host factor H in the adhesion of S. suis to epithelial and endothelial cells. Both Fhb and Fhbp play, to a certain extent, a role in such increased factor H-dependent adhesion. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of S. suis, independently {{of the presence of}} its sialic acid moiety, was also shown {{to be involved in the}} <b>recruitment</b> of <b>factor</b> H. However, a triple mutant lacking Fhb, Fhbp and CPS was still able to recruit factor H resulting in the degradation of C 3 b in the presence of factor I. In the presence of complement factors, the double mutant lacking Fhb and Fhbp was similarly phagocytosed by human macrophages and killed by pig blood when compared to the wild-type strain. In conclusion, this study suggests that <b>recruitment</b> of <b>factor</b> H to the S. suis cell surface is multifactorial and redundant...|$|R

40|$|Melaleuca densispicata Byrnes is an {{uncommon}} species {{with a limited}} distribution, comprising disjunct populations in inland southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, Australia. It is a dense, woody shrub, 2 – 4 m in height, which exhibits a marked 'clumping' growth habit. It has thick, papery bark and displays many white flowers during spring or early summer. Although {{it has long been}} known to exist, M. densispicata was only formally described in 1984, and very little is currently known about its ecology or specific management requirements. There are only seven known subpopulations of the species across its range. A major population at the western limit of its distribution occurs on Currawinya National Park (28 ° 52 'S, 144 ° 30 'E). Here, it is locally abundant and listed as a noteworthy plant species under the Management Plan (Queensland Parks & Wildlife Service 2001). This study aimed to identify patterns in the distribution of M. densispicata in Currawinya National Park, describe its ecological niche and role, and provide management recommendations for the species within the study area. Recent anecdotal observations of recruitment failure in south-western Queensland (Peter McRae, QPWS, October 2004, pers. comm.; Dick O'Connell, local grazier, July 2005 pers. comm.) caused additional emphasis to be placed on the examination of <b>recruitment</b> and <b>recruitment</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|R
40|$|The CRISPR/Cas 9 {{system is}} a highly {{effective}} tool for genome editing. Key to robust genome editing is the efficient delivery of the CRISPR/Cas 9 machinery. Viral delivery systems are efficient vehicles for the transduction of foreign genes but commonly used viral vectors suffer from a limited capacity in the genetic information they can carry. Baculovirus however is capable of carrying large exogenous DNA fragments. Here we investigate the use of baculoviral vectors as a delivery vehicle for CRISPR/Cas 9 based genome-editing tools. We demonstrate transduction of a panel of cell lines with Cas 9 and an sgRNA sequence, which results in efficient knockout of all four targeted subunits of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). We further show that introduction of a homology directed repair template into the same CRISPR/Cas 9 baculovirus facilitates introduction of specific point mutations and endogenous gene tags. Tagging of the CPC <b>recruitment</b> <b>factor</b> Haspin with the fluorescent reporter YFP allowed us to study its native localization as well as recruitment to the cohesin subunit Pds 5 B...|$|E
40|$|Second {{messengers}} {{control a}} wide range of important cellular functions in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Here we show that cyclic di-GMP, a global bacterial second messenger, promotes cell cycle progression in Caulobacter crescentus by mediating the specific degradation of the replication initiation inhibitor CtrA. During the G 1 -to-S-phase transition, both CtrA and its cognate protease ClpXP dynamically localize to the old cell pole, where CtrA is rapidly degraded. Sequestration of CtrA to the cell pole depends on PopA, a newly identified cyclic di-GMP effector protein. PopA itself localizes to the cell pole and directs CtrA to this subcellular site via the direct interaction with a mediator protein, RcdA. We present evidence that c-di-GMP regulates CtrA degradation during the cell cycle by controlling the dynamic sequestration of the PopA <b>recruitment</b> <b>factor</b> to the cell pole. Furthermore, we show that cell cycle timing of CtrA degradation relies on converging pathways responsible for substrate and protease localization to the old cell pole. This is the first report that links cyclic di-GMP to protein dynamics and cell cycle control in bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Telomeres are the {{physical}} ends of linear chromosomes in eukaryotes. Telomeres not only protect chromosome ends from being recognized as double-strand breaks but also maintain the chromosome terminal sequences. These processes involve {{a number of}} telomere-related proteins. A major challenge {{in the field is}} to elucidate the full constitution of telomere-associated proteins and to understand how different protein complexes are regulated at chromosome termini. Here, I report the identification and characterization of STN 1 (Suppressor of cdc thirteen, 1), CTC 1 (Conserved Telomere maintenance Component 1) and TEN 1 (Telomeric pathways in association with Stn 1, 1) in Arabidopsis. CTC 1 /STN 1 /TEN 1 (CST) forms a trimeric complex that specifically associates with telomeres. Loss of any component of the CST induces catastrophic telomere loss, disrupted telomere end architecture, and massive chromosome end-to-end fusions. Thus, CST plays an essential role in chromosome end protection. I also show that CST function at telomeres is independent of a previously characterized capping complex KU 70 /KU 80, and that ATR is responsible for a checkpoint response in plants lacking CTC 1 /STN 1. Additionally, I present data showing that Arabidopsis POT 1 a (Protection Of Telomere 1, a) has evolved as a telomerase <b>recruitment</b> <b>factor.</b> Unlike POT 1 in other eukaryotes which binds and protects ss telomeric DNA, AtPOT 1 a interacts with telomerase RNA (TER). Based on an evolutionary analysis, we found that the POT 1 a lineage is under positive selection in the Brassicaceae family in which Arabidopsis belongs. Mutations of two positive selection sites significantly reduce POT 1 a?s activity in vivo. These data suggest POT 1 a is under pressure to evolve from a telomeric DNA binding protein to a TER binding protein. I also discovered that POT 1 a interacts with the novel telomere capping protein CTC 1 in vitro and in vivo. Thus, I hypothesize that POT 1 a acts as a telomerase <b>recruitment</b> <b>factor</b> linking this enzyme to the chromosome termini via interacting with TER and CTC 1. Finally, I dissected the functional domains of POT 1 a and demonstrated that both the N-terminus and the C-terminus of POT 1 a are required for its function in vivo. In summary, my work has uncovered several new and essential telomereassociated proteins that provide new insight into mechanisms of chromosome end protection and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Expression of {{the chicken}} {{lysozyme}} gene is upregulated during macrophage differentiation and reaches its highest level in bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated macrophages. This is accompanied by complex alterations in chromatin structure. We have previously shown that chromatin fine-structure alterations precede the onset of gene expression in macrophage precursor cells and mark the lysozyme chromatin domain for expression later in development. To further examine this phenomenon and to investigate {{the basis for the}} differentiation-dependent alterations of lysozyme chromatin, we studied the <b>recruitment</b> of transcription <b>factors</b> to the lysozyme locus in vivo at different stages of myeloid differentiation. <b>Factor</b> <b>recruitment</b> occurred in several steps. First, early-acting transcription factors such as NF 1 and Fli- 1 bound to a subset of enhancer elements and recruited CREB-binding protein. LPS stimulation led to an additional recruitment of C/EBPβ and a significant change in enhancer and promoter structure. Transcription <b>factor</b> <b>recruitment</b> was accompanied by specific changes in histone modification within the lysozyme chromatin domain. Interestingly, we present evidence for a transient interaction of transcription factors with lysozyme chromatin in lysozyme-nonexpressing macrophage precursors, which was accompanied by a partial demethylation of CpG sites. This indicates that a partially accessible chromatin structure of lineage-specific genes is a hallmark of hematopoietic progenitor cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{temporal}} variation in density and pattern of {{spatial distribution of}} Paepalanthus polyanthus (BONG.) Kunth (Eriocaulaceae) were evaluated at a determinate sand dune. This study was carried out {{over a period of}} five years, at three permanent plots of 25 m 2 in a sand dune slack at Joaquina Beach, Florianópolis, SC, Brazil. There were strong density fluctuations throughout these years. In areas 1, 2 and 3, the densities changed from 10. 4, 2. 2 and 1. 8 plants/m 2 in December 1986 to 75. 8, 11. 4 and 45. 6 plants/m 2 in December 1991. Area 3, situated on an elevated site, presented greater variation in density, with no live plants in December 1989 and 102. 2 plants/m 2 at the recruitment observed in May 1990. Despite these density fluctuations, the pattern of spatial distribution was always aggregated (Id> 1, P< 0. 05). The greatest Id values occurred in periods of low density and not in those of high density, associated with seedling <b>recruitment.</b> <b>Factors</b> such as high seed production with low dispersal, massive germination in moit years and a comparatively high death rate of seedlings at sites more subject to flooding or more distant from the water table proved themselves able to promote this aggregate pattern and increase it during plant development...|$|R
