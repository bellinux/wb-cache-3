50|$|A ramp-compare ADC {{produces}} a saw-tooth signal that ramps {{up or down}} then quickly returns to zero. When the ramp starts, a timer starts counting. When the ramp voltage matches the input, a comparator fires, and the timer's value is recorded. Timed ramp converters require the least number of transistors. The <b>ramp</b> <b>time</b> is sensitive to temperature because the circuit generating the ramp is often a simple oscillator. There are two solutions: use a clocked counter driving a DAC and then use the comparator to preserve the counter's value, or calibrate the timed ramp. A special advantage of the ramp-compare system is that comparing a second signal just requires another comparator, and another register to store the voltage value. A very simple (non-linear) ramp-converter can be implemented with a microcontroller and one resistor and capacitor. Vice versa, a filled capacitor can be taken from an integrator, time-to-amplitude converter, phase detector, sample and hold circuit, or peak and hold circuit and discharged. This has the advantage that a slow comparator cannot be disturbed by fast input changes.|$|E

The present study was conducted with the objectives to extract genomic DNA of G. elata, execute RAPD analysis with different PCR <b>ramp</b> <b>time</b> and discuss the relationship between the amplification efficiency and the G/C content of RAPD primers subsequently. The Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide (CTAB) protocol was used in the genomic DNA extraction. Ten RAPD primers were randomly selected in PCR amplifications. The <b>ramp</b> <b>time</b> parameters from annealing to extension were used 0. 3 and 3 °C sec - 1, respectively. The concentration of G. elata genomic DNA were about 50 ng μL - 1 with a 1. 93 purity. Obviously, the amplified band numbers and resolution were improved when using a 0. 3 °C sec - 1 <b>ramp</b> <b>time</b> in the RAPD analysis. The band number increase is closely related to the G/(G+C) ratio of RAPD primers. Therefore, the extracted G. elata genomic DNA is suitable for PCR amplifications and the prolonged <b>ramp</b> <b>time</b> is helpful to improve the RAPD resolution and production. These are valuable references for molecular identification and biodiversity analysis of G. elata populations...|$|E

We have investigated the impact of various parameters such as tank-capacitance to load capacitance ratio, <b>ramping</b> <b>time,</b> transistors sizing and power supply voltage scaling on energy recovery achievable in the 2 -step charging circuit.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of thermomagnetic convection of paramagnetic fluids {{placed in a}} micro-gravity condition (g ≈ 0) and under a uniform vertical gradient magnetic field in an open ended square enclosure with ramp heating temperature condition applied on a vertical wall is investigated in this study. In presence of the strong magnetic gradient field thermal convection of the paramagnetic fluid might take place even in a zero-gravity environment as {{a direct consequence of}} temperature differences occurring within the fluid. The thermal boundary layer develops adjacent to the hot wall as soon as the ramp temperature condition is applied on it. There are two scenarios can be observed based on the ramp heating time. The steady state of the thermal boundary layer can be reached before the <b>ramp</b> <b>time</b> is finished or vice versa. If the <b>ramp</b> <b>time</b> is larger than the quasi-steady time then the thermal boundary layer is in a quasi-steady mode with convection balancing conduction after the quasi-steady time. Further increase of the heat input simply accelerates the flow to maintain the proper thermal balance.

40|$|It {{is found}} in the {{literature}} that the existing scaling results for the boundary layer thickness, velocity and steady state time for the natural convection flow over an evenly heated plate provide a very poor prediction of the Prandtl number dependency of the flow. However, those scalings provide a good prediction of two other governing parameters’ dependency, the Rayleigh number and the aspect ratio. Therefore, an improved scaling analysis using a triple-layer integral approach and direct numerical simulations have been performed for the natural convection boundary layer along a semi-infinite flat plate with uniform surface heat flux. This heat flux is a ramp function of time, where the temperature gradient on the surface increases with time up to some specific time and then remains constant. The growth of the boundary layer strongly depends on the <b>ramp</b> <b>time.</b> If the <b>ramp</b> <b>time</b> is sufficiently long, the boundary layer reaches a quasi steady mode before the growth of the temperature gradient is completed.

Enzymatic browning of the juice and the appearance of a precipitate in the bottom of containers is due to the fact that the treatment is able to only inactivate 66 % of polyphenoloxidase and 84. 9 % of pectinmethylesterase enzymes. The addiction of ascorbic acid was essential to maintenance the colour of juice, at 4 °C during 35 days. By varying the applied pressure (450 to 600 MPa) it was concluded that the inactivation of polyphenoloxidase was directly proportional to pressure, however an effective inactivation was not reached even at higher pressures. Futhermore, for pressures higher than 578 MPa a complete (100 %) inactivation of pectinmethylesterase was achieved.

30|$|According to the {{difference}} of ramp directions, ramp events can be generally divided into two basic types: up-ramp and down-ramp [6]. The characteristic of the up-ramps is sharply increasing. Strong low pressure air systems (or cyclones), low-level jets, thunderstorms, wind gusts or similar atmospheric phenomena will induce up-ramps [7]. Likewise when the wind power suddenly drops or high speed gusts of wind make wind turbines reach cut-out limits (usually 22 ~ 25 m/s), wind turbines would be shut down for protecting themselves from damages. All this phenomena could induce down-ramps [8]. Down-ramps are the reverse physical process of up-ramps [9].

The evolution of micro- structure during shock waves pass through materials is essential to many practical applications, such as the field of blast and ballistic protection. Traditional continuum theory cannot involve any atomic information of materials when shock waves pass through. Non- equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation {{is thought to be}} a promising way to bridge microscopic atomic processes with macroscopic continuum behaviors. The α→ɛ transition of iron at about 13 GPa has been recognized {{for more than half a}} century, but no essential progress have been make until the recent decades. Experiments still have difficulties to reach temporal and spatial scales and NEMD can make an essential complements. Unfortunately, the former atomic interaction potentials of iron are more or less not appropriate to the high pressure area.

Matrix effects {{are known to}} exist with the application of this technique; in fact, {{it was observed that}} different solvents lead to different results. Therefore, standard additions have to be employed for quantitative determinations, resulting in high costs and long analysis times. In an attempt to understand these interfering effects, fractional factorial designs were proposed to determine whether any GFAAS parameter was responsible for, or related to, the matrix effects. Seven GFAAS parameters were investigated: final temperature, <b>ramp</b> <b>time</b> and hold time of the transitions step (from the dry step); final temperature, <b>ramp</b> <b>time</b> and hold time of the ashing/pyrolysis step; <b>ramp</b> <b>time</b> of the atomisation step. The results showed that the matrix effects were not related to any specific parameter. A complete factorial design was implemented to demonstrate the fundamental role of the atomisation temperature. SEM analysis showed that the surface of the graphite tubes might be affected in different ways by different solvents. A Principal Component Analysis demonstrated that the matrix effects {{may be related to the}} viscosity and melting point of the solvents and may be independent of their molar mass. To identify the origins of these effects, an investigation on the link between the tube surface-sample matrix interactions and the physical properties of the matrices is recommended.
