40|$|International audienceThe {{shear layer}} {{instability}} in the flow between two counter-rotating disks enclosed by a cylinder is investigated experimentally and numerically, for radius-to-height ratio Γ = R/h between 2 and 21. For sufficiently large rotation ratio, the internal shear layer that separates two regions of opposite azimuthal velocities is prone to an azimuthal symmetry breaking, which is investigated experimentally by means of visualization and particle image velocimetry. The associated pattern {{is a combination of}} a sharp-cornered polygonal pattern, as observed by Lopez et al. (2002) for low aspect ratio, surrounded by a set of spiral arms, first described by Gauthier et al. (2002) for high aspect ratio. The spiral arms result from the interaction of the shear layer instability with the Ekman boundary layer over the faster rotating disk. Stability curves and critical modes are experimentally measured for the whole range of aspect ratios, and are found to compare well with numerical simulations of the three-dimensional time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations over an extensive <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters.</b> <b>Measurements</b> of a local Reynolds number based on the shear layer thickness confirm that a shear layer instability, with only weak curvature effect, is responsible for the observed patterns. This scenario is supported by the observed onset modes, which scale as the shear layer radius, and by the measured phase velocities...|$|E

40|$|The {{apparent}} {{complexity of}} the laser‐plasma coupling in laser fusion target irradiation has stimulated the need for carefully controlled experimental studies of the laser‐plasma interaction at the critical surface. A helium Z pinch has been constructed which produces a high density plasma, independent of the laser, enabling {{the separation of the}} laser‐plasma interaction physics from the plasma formation mechanism. Its peak electron density (4 × 1019 cm− 3), critical density scale length (70 – 200 μ), and temperature (∼ 25 eV) make it suitable for simulating and studying laser‐pellet interaction mechanisms at CO 2 laser wavelengths. Detailed numerical modelling of these experiments was employed as a check against our diagnostics, as well as providing physical insight in those <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> experimental <b>parameters</b> where <b>measurements</b> were not made...|$|R
40|$|Model {{reliability}} {{is important}} when groundwater models {{are used for}} evaluation of environmental impact and water resource management. Model attributes such as geohydrologic units and parameter values need to be quantified {{in order to obtain}} reliable results. A primary objective of sampling design for groundwater models is to increase the reliability of modelling results by selecting effective measurement locations and times. It is advantageous to employ simulation models to guide measurement strategies already in early investigation stages. Normally, optimal design is only possible when model attributes are known prior to constructing a design. This is not a meaningful requirement as the model attributes are the final result of the analysis and are not known beforehand. Thus, robust design methods are required that are effective for <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameter</b> values, <b>measurement</b> error types and for alternative conceptual models. Parameter sensitivity is the fundamental model property that is used in this thesis to create effective designs. For conceptual model uncertainty, large-scale sensitivity analysis is used to devise networks that capture sufficient information to determine which model best describes the system with a minimum of measurement points. In fixed conceptual models, effective parameter- and error-robust designs are based on criteria that minimise the size <b>of</b> the <b>parameter</b> covariance matrix (D-optimality). Optimal designs do not necessarily have observations with the highest parameter sensitivities because D-optimality reduces parameter estimation errors by balancing high sensitivity and low correlation between parameters. Ignoring correlation in sparse designs may result in considerably inefficient designs. Different measurement error assumptions may also give widely different optimal designs. Early stage design often involves simple homogenous models for which the design effectiveness may be seriously offset by significant aquifer heterogeneity. Simple automatic and manual methods are possible for design generation. While none of these guarantee globally optimal designs, they do generate designs that are more effective than those normally used for measurement programs. Effective designs are seldom intuitively obvious, indicating that this methodology is quite useful. A general benefit of this type of analysis, in addition to the actual generation of designs, is insight into the relative importance of model attributes and their relation to different measurement strategies...|$|R

The repeatability of each scan mode was assessed. One additional 25 -picture scan was acquired by a second observer to test reproducibility. Results. : Overall, the Pentacam HR had good precision, with the cornea fine scan returning the most precise results. The 25 - and 50 -picture scans showed similar precision. The repeatability limits, expressed as the within-subject SD × 1. 96 √ 2 of the anterior keratometry (K) 1 and K 2 readings with the standard 25 -picture scan, were 0. 25 and 0. 36 D, respectively. Pachymetry maps, corneal maps, anterior chamber depth maps, corneal volume, topometric Q values and indices were also found to be precise. Poor precision was found for estimates of axis (astigmatic and progression index), pupil center pachymetry, single points on corneal maps, refractive power maps, and equivalent K readings. Conclusions. : Measurements taken with the Pentacam HR are repeatable and reproducible, especially those obtained with the cornea fine scan. Although the Pentacam HR is clearly a very useful clinical and research tool, the measurement of corneal axes, pupil center pachymetry, front meridional and axial maps, refractive power maps, and equivalent K readings should be interpreted with caution...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityLight {{interacts with}} {{biological}} tissue through two predominant mechanisms: scattering and absorption, which {{are sensitive to}} the size and density of cellular organelles, and to biochemical composition (ex. hemoglobin), respectively. During the progression of disease, tissues undergo a predictable set of changes in cell morphology and vascularization, which directly affect their scattering and absorption properties. Hence, quantification of these optical property differences can be used to identify the physiological biomarkers of disease with interest often focused on cancer. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is a diagnostic tool, wherein broadband visible light is transmitted through a fiber optic probe into a turbid medium, and after propagating through the sample, a fraction of the light is collected at the surface as reflectance. The measured reflectance spectrum can be analyzed with appropriate mathematical models to extract the optical properties of the tissue, and from these, a set of physiological properties. A number of models have been developed for this purpose using a variety of approaches [...] from diffusion theory, to computational simulations, and empirical observations. However, these models are generally limited to narrow <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> tissue and probe geometries. In this thesis, reflectance models were developed for a much wider <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>parameters,</b> and influences such as the scattering phase function and probe design were investigated rigorously for the first time. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence reflectance, with novel insights that, in some cases, challenge current assumptions in the field. An improved Monte Carlo simulation program, designed to run on a graphics processing unit (GPU), was built to simulate the data used {{in the development of the}} reflectance models. Rigorous error analysis was performed to identify how inaccuracies in modeling assumptions can be expected to affect the accuracy of extracted optical property values from experimentallyacquired reflectance spectra. From this analysis, probe geometries that offer the best robustness against error in estimation of physiological properties from tissue, are presented. Finally, several in vivo studies demonstrating the use of reflectance spectroscopy for both research and clinical applications are presented...|$|R
40|$|Bioequivalence {{studies are}} an {{essential}} part of the evaluation of generic drugs. The most common in-vivo bioequivalence (BE) study design is the two-period two-treatment crossover design. AUC (area under the concentration-time curve) and Cmax (maximum concentration) are obtained from the observed concentration-time profiles for each subject from each treatment under each sequence. In the BE evaluation of pharmacokinetic crossover studies, the normality of the univariate response variable, e. g. log(AUC) or log(Cmax) is often assumed in the literature without much evidence. Therefore, we investigate the distributional assumption of the normality of response variables, log(AUC), log(Cmax), and log(Tmax) by simulating concentration-time profiles from the two-stage pharmacokinetic models for a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> pharmacokinetic <b>parameters</b> and <b>measurement</b> error structures. Our simulation shows that log(AUC) has heavy tails and log(Cmax) is skewed. We study the impact of the non-normality of response variable on the sample size and type I error rate. Under the normality of the response variable, the most common approach to testing for bioequivalence is the two one-sided tests procedure. We develop the exact analytical formula for the probability of rejection in the two one-sided tests procedure for crossover bioequivalence studies under general parameter settings. Our exact formulas for power and sample size are shown to improve in realistic parameter settings over the previous approximations. We propose a new unblinded sample size re-estimation strategy. The new total sample size is calculated from our exact power function for the one stage using the estimated variance from the Stage 1 as the true variance. If the sample variance from Stage 1 is smaller than the initial variance from the historical data, then we stop at the end of Stage 1 and analyze Stage 1 data with the standard t- quantile. Otherwise, we collect data from additional subjects. We then analyze the combined data from both Stage 1 and Stage 2 with a new test statistic using the pooled variance of two stages. The exact critical values for the new test statistics are derived as the largest of u for which the following condition holds: the experimentwise type I error rate is exactly alpha...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to provide {{guidance}} and information that will assist forensic speech scientists, and phoneticians generally, in making more accurate formant measurements, using commonly available speech analysis tools. Formant measurements are an important speech feature that are often examined in forensic casework, and are used widely in many other areas {{within the field of}} phonetics. However, the performance of software currently used by analysts has not been subject to detailed investigation. This thesis reports on a series of experiments that examine the influence that the analysis tools, analysis settings and speakers have on formant measurements. The influence of these three factors was assessed by examining formant measurement errors and their behaviour. This was done using both synthetic and real speech. The synthetic speech was generated with known formant values so that the measurement errors could be calculated precisely. To investigate the influence of different speakers on measurement performance, synthetic speakers were created with different third formant structures and with different glottal source signals. These speakers’ synthetic vowels were analysed using Praat’s normal formant measuring tool across a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> LPC orders. The real speech was from a subset of 186 speakers from the TIMIT corpus. The measurements from these speakers were compared with a set of hand-corrected reference formant values to establish the performance of four measurement tools across a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> analysis <b>parameters</b> and <b>measurement</b> strategies. The analysis of the measurement errors explored the relationships between the analysis tools, the analysis parameters and the speakers, and also examined how the errors varied over the vowel space. LPC order was found to have the greatest influence on the magnitude of the errors and their overall behaviour was closely associated with the underlying measurement process used by the tools. The performance of the formant trackers tended to be better than the simple Praat measuring tool, and allowing the LPC order to vary across tokens improved the performance for all tools. The performance was found to differ across speakers, and for each real speaker, the best performance was obtained when the measurements were made with a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> LPC orders, rather than being restricted to just one. The most significant guidance that arises from the results is that analysts should have an understanding of the basis of LPC analysis and know how it is applied to obtain formant measurements in the software that they use. They should also understand the influence of LPC order and the other analysis parameters concerning formant tracking. This will enable them to select the most appropriate settings and avoid making unreliable measurements...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Swimming performance is primarily judged on the overall time taken for a swimmer to complete a specified distance performing a stroke that complies with current regulations defined by the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA), the International governing body of swimming. There are three contributing factors to this overall time; the start, free swimming and turns. The contribution {{of each of these}} factors is event dependent; for example, in a 50 m event there are no turns, however, the start can be a significant contributor. To improve overall performance each of these components should be optimised in terms of skill and execution. This thesis details the research undertaken towards improving performance-related feedback in swimming. The research included collaboration with British Swimming, the national governing body for swimming in the U. K., to drive the requirements and direction of research. An evaluation of current methods of swimming analysis identified a capability gap in real-time, quantitative feedback. A number of components were developed to produce an integrated system for comprehensive swim performance analysis in all phases of the swim, i. e. starts, free swimming and turns. These components were developed to satisfy two types of stakeholder requirements. Firstly, the measurement requirements, i. e. what does the end user want to measure? Secondly, the process requirements, i. e. how would these measurements be achieved? The components developed in this research worked towards new technologies to facilitate a wider <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>parameters</b> using automated methods as well as the application of technologies to facilitate the automation of current techniques. The development of the system is presented in detail and the application of these technologies is presented in case studies for starts, free swimming and turns. It was found that developed components were able to provide useful data indicating levels of performance in all aspects of swimming, i. e. starts, free swimming and turns. For the starts, an integrated solution of vision, force plate technology and a wireless iii node enabled greater insight into overall performance and quantitative measurements of performance to be captured. Force profiles could easily identify differences in swimmer ability or changes in technique. The analysis of free swimming was predominantly supported by the wireless sensor technology, whereby signal analysis was capable of automatically determining factors such as lap times variations within strokes. The turning phase was also characterised in acceleration space, allowing the phases of the turn to be individually assessed and their contribution to total turn time established. Each of the component technologies were not used in isolation but were supported by other synchronous data capture. In all cases a vision component was used to increase understanding of data outputs and provide a medium that coaches and athletes were comfortable with interpreting. The integrated, component based system has been developed and tested to prove its ability to produce useful, quantitative feedback information for swimmers. The individual components were found to be capable of providing greater insight into swimming performance, that has not been previously possible using {{the current state of the}} art techniques. Future work should look towards the fine-tuning of the prototype system into a useable solution for end users. This relies on the refinement of components and the development of an appropriate user interface to enable ease of data collection, analysis, presentation and interpretation...|$|R
