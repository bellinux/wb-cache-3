25|$|Building {{up to the}} 2012 presidential election, it was {{interesting}} to see how strong the influence of social media would be following the 2008 campaigns, where Obama's winning campaign had been social media-heavy, whereas McCain's campaign did not really grasp social media. JFK was the first president who <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> television, and similarly, Obama is the first president to fully understand the power of social media. Obama has recognized social media is about creating relationships and connections and therefore used social media to the advantage of presidential election campaigns, in which Obama has dominated his opponents in terms of social media space.|$|E

500|$|In May 1975, Roddenberry {{entered a}} {{development}} deal with Paramount, with principal photography intended {{to start on}} July 15, 1976, and a budget of $5 million. He started work on treatments; his first involved {{the formation of the}} Enterprise crew, including their training at Starfleet Academy and the formation of Starfleet, but this idea was never submitted to Paramount. His first major submitted script was The God Thing. A scene involving a discussion in which Spock's tutors describe religion on Earth worried the studio. The tutor says, [...] "We have never <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> your Earth legend of gods. Particularly in that so many of your gods have said, 'You have to bow down on your bellies every seven days and worship me'. This seems to us like they are very insecure gods." [...] Roddenberry completed the script on 30 June; Paramount rejected it the following month. The studio was also unhappy with, and rejected, scripts by Robert Silverberg, Chris Knopt, Dick Simmons and Theodore Sturgeon. Roddenberry blamed religious Paramount executives including Barry Diller for turning down The God Thing, a story that writer Jon Povill summarized as [...] "God was a malfunctioning spaceship".|$|E

[...] La Rivière's attention is drawn to one of Mac's lines {{at the end of the}} pilot, in a scene that he considers [...] "amusing"; the professor's admonition [...] "Don't come crying to me if you get hurt!" [...] represents his preparedness to [...] "abnegate all parental responsibility" [...] towards his adoptive son. Observing the series' subscription to [...] "wider themes in Cold War culture", Cull likens the BIG RAT's powers to brainwashing, but concludes that it is a fundamentally [...] "benign" [...] technology. The more violent style introduced in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons is sometimes evident in Joe 90: in [...] "Hi-jacked", Joe kills an enemy with a grenade, while in [...] "Project 90", Professor McClaine is menaced by a drill poised to pulverise his head. On the subject of violence, episode director Desmond Saunders comments: [...] "There was an unpleasant side to it which I never <b>really</b> <b>understood.</b> There was something about it that was very strange and sinister." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune {{believed}} Nolan and Goyer {{managed to}} [...] "comfortably mix the tormented drama and revenge motifs with light hearted gags and comic book allusions," [...] and that Nolan takes the series {{out of the}} [...] "slam-bang Hollywood jokefests" [...] the franchise had drifted into. Comic book scribe and editor Dennis O'Neil stated that he [...] "felt the filmmakers <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> the character they were translating", citing this film as {{the best of the}} live-action Batman films. In contrast, J.R. Jones, from the Chicago Reader, criticized the script, and Nolan and David Goyer for not living up to the [...] "hype about exploring Batman's damaged psyche". Roger Ebert, who gave mixed reviews to the previous films, and claimed in his review for Batman Returns that he did not believe noir worked in superhero films, wrote this was [...] "the Batman movie I've been waiting for; more correctly, this is the movie I did not realize I was waiting for". Giving it four out of four stars, he commended the realistic portrayals of the Batman arsenal – the Batsuit, Batcave, Tumbler, and the Batsignal – as well as the focus on [...] "the story and character" [...] with less stress on [...] "high-tech action".|$|E
500|$|Co-creator and {{executive}} producer Roberto Orci explained {{in an interview that}} the big reveal {{at the end of the}} episode, in which Olivia meets Bell in the parallel universe, was actually planned for a fourth season, but the writers decided [...] "let's actually answer something instead and not get, not just rely on that mystery forever. And so we actually chose to give kind of a big answer and have to come with a different show than we ever intended". The writers wanted to use an iconic image [...] for the scene, leading to staff writer Andrew Kreisberg's suggestion of the Twin Towers. Wyman first thought it was [...] "the greatest idea in the world" [...] before having doubts that its use would [...] "sensationalize" [...] it. He explained, [...] "But then, when we started thinking about it, we thought collectively America <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> 9/11 is such a monumental moment so we felt it wasn’t exploited but indicative of the times we’re living in right now. We used it and that was the end of the first season and then we were all really thrilled with where it was going." [...] The cast would later recollect on the series, and for Jackson, considered that the show has never [...] "had a better visual or a better cliff-hanger" [...] as this finale.|$|E
500|$|Jocelyn Vena from MTV {{believed}} that the video was symbolic and portrayed how [...] "the old Gaga is over, here's the brand-new Gaga: the one who seems to delight in pushing the boundaries and exploring all manner of sexual proclivities". She further {{believed that}} the video was a testament to Gaga's brilliance [...] "as an artist that uses the video art form as the jump-off point for the next leg of their career". In 2011, Claire Suddath of Time said that although later Gaga videos were more elaborate, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] was Gaga at her best. In Lady Gaga: Behind the Fame, Emily Herbert drew comparisons between the underlying theme of the video and the theme of The Fame Monster—the relationship with fame. She wrote, [...] "Was this the price that Gaga {{had to pay for}} the fame she so desired? Did she feel as if she'd had to prostitute herself in some way? The themes were all based around sex, decadence, and corruption; alcohol and even cigarettes, twenty-first century society's biggest no-no, were present, and so by implication ... drugs." [...] The Wall Street Journal noted Gaga {{as one of the few}} pop stars of the present time who <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> spectacle, fashion, shock, choreography—all the things that Madonna and Michael Jackson were masters of in the 1980s.|$|E

500|$|Of Presley's {{films in}} the 1960s, 15 were {{accompanied}} by soundtrack albums and another 5 by soundtrack EPs. The films' rapid production and release schedules—he frequently starred in three a year—affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: [...] "three ballads, one medium-tempo , one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie". As the decade wore on, {{the quality of the}} soundtrack songs grew [...] "progressively worse". Julie Parrish, who appeared in Paradise, Hawaiian Style (1966), says that he hated many of the songs chosen for his films. The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how Presley would retreat from the studio microphone: [...] "The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it." [...] Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman. But by and large, according to biographer Jerry Hopkins, the numbers seemed to be [...] "written on order by men who never <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> Elvis or rock and roll." [...] Regardless of the songs' quality, {{it has been argued that}} Presley generally sang them well, with commitment. Critic Dave Marsh heard the opposite: [...] "Presley isn't trying, probably the wisest course in the face of material like 'No Room to Rumba in a Sports Car' and 'Rock-a-Hula Baby.'" ...|$|E
500|$|By October 2013, Marvel was {{preparing}} four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, {{to present to}} video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest. In November 2013, {{it was announced that}} Disney would provide Netflix with live-action series based on Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders. Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that Netflix was chosen to air the shows, [...] "when Disney realized it could use the streaming service as a way to grow the popularity of the characters". He added that, if the characters prove popular, they could become feature films. Loeb later stated that Marvel was not [...] "interested in making four pilots and then hoping someday that they could all get together. Netflix <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> what it is we wanted to do. They're very open to directors that might not have that same opportunity in broadcast television. The notion of having all 13 episodes at one time, particularly in serialized storytelling, is very appealing." [...] Loeb also added that the four characters chosen [...] "all had a previous existing relationship and all grew up on the same kind of stoop in New York [...] So it lent itself to a world. Does that mean these shows {{are going to be the}} same? No. They can't be. The characters have different issues, different problems, different feelings about them ... the example that I continually give is that I cannot think of two films that are more different in tone than [...] and Guardians of the Galaxy. And yet, if you watch them back to back, they feel very Marvel. They feel very much like, 'Oh, it is still the same universe that I'm in.'" ...|$|E
