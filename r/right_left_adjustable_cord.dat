Nakayama, On Frobeniusean algebras II, Annals of Mathematics 42 (1941) 1 – 21] {{showed that}} over an artinian serial ring every module {{is a direct}} sum of uniserial modules. Hence artinian serial rings have the {{property}} that each <b>right</b> (<b>left)</b> ideal is a finite direct sum of quasi-injective <b>right</b> (<b>left)</b> ideals. A ring with the property that each <b>right</b> (<b>left)</b> ideal is a finite direct sum of quasi-injective <b>right</b> (<b>left)</b> ideals will be called a <b>right</b> (<b>left)</b> Σ-q ring. For example, commutative self-injective rings are Σ-q rings. In this paper, various classes of such rings that include local, simple, prime, right non-singular right artinian, and right serial, are studied. Prime right self-injective right Σ-q rings are shown to be simple artinian. Right artinian right non-singular right Σ-q rings are upper triangular block matrix rings over rings which are either zero rings or division rings. In general, a Σ-q ring is not left-right symmetric nor is it Morita invariant...|$|R

It is still unknown whether a <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> SF-ring is von Neumann regular. In this paper, we give some {{conditions}} for a <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> SF-ring to be (a) von Neumann regular; (b) strongly regular; (c) division ring. It is proved that: (1) a right SF-ring R is regular if maximal essential <b>right</b> (<b>left)</b> ideals of R are weakly <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> ideals of R (this result gives an affirmative {{answer to the question}} raised by Zhang in 1994); (2) a left SF-ring R is strongly regular if every non-zero <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> ideal of R contains a non-zero <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> ideal of R which is a W-ideal; (3) if R is a left SF-ring such that l(x) (r(x)) is an essential <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> ideal for every <b>right</b> (<b>left)</b> zero divisor x of R, then R is a division ring. 1...|$|R
