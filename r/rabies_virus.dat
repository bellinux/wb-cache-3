5|$|Viruses {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entities on Earth and they outnumber all the others put together. They infect all types of cellular life including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi. However, different types of viruses can infect only a limited range of hosts and many are species-specific. Some, such as smallpox virus for example, can infect only one species – in this case humans, and are said to have a narrow host range. Other viruses, such as <b>rabies</b> <b>virus,</b> can infect different species of mammals and are said to have a broad range. The viruses that infect plants are harmless to animals, and most viruses that infect other animals are harmless to humans. The host range of some bacteriophages is limited to a single strain of bacteria and they can be used to trace the source of outbreaks of infections by a method called phage typing.|$|E

25|$|Rabies {{is caused}} by lyssaviruses, {{including}} the <b>rabies</b> <b>virus</b> and Australian bat lyssavirus. Rabies is spread when an infected animal scratches or bites another animal or human. Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes {{into contact with the}} eyes, mouth, or nose. Globally, dogs are the most common animal involved. More than 99% of rabies cases in countries where dogs commonly have the disease are caused by dog bites. In the Americas, bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans, and less than 5% of cases are from dogs. Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies. The <b>rabies</b> <b>virus</b> travels to the brain by following the peripheral nerves. The disease can only be diagnosed after the start of symptoms.|$|E
40|$|Most human rabies {{deaths in}} the United States can be {{attributed}} to unrecognized exposures to <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> associated with bats, particularly those associated with two infrequently encountered bat species (Lasionycteris noctivagans and Pipistrellus subflavus). These human rabies cases tend to cluster in the southeastern and northwestern United States. In these regions, most rabies deaths associated with bats in nonhuman terrestrial mammals are also associated with virus variants specific to these two bat species rather than more common bat species; outside of these regions, more common bat <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> contribute to most transmissions. The preponderance of rabies deaths connected with the two uncommon L. noctivagans and P. subflavus bat <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> is best explained by their evolution of increased viral infectivity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRabies {{still remains}} {{a public health}} threat in the Philippines. A {{significant}} number of human rabies cases, about 200 – 300 cases annually, have been reported, and the country needs an effective strategy for rabies control. To develop an effective control strategy, {{it is important to}} understand the transmission patterns of the <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses.</b> We conducted phylogenetic analyses by considering the temporal and spatial evolution of <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> to reveal the transmission dynamics in the Philippines. After evaluating the molecular clock and phylogeographic analysis, we estimated that the Philippine strains were introduced from China around the beginning of 20 th century. Upon this introduction, the <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> evolved within the Philippines to form three major clades, and there was no indication of introduction of other <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> from any other country. However, within the Philippines, island-to-island migrations were observed. Since then, the <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> have diffused and only evolved within each island group. The evolutionary pattern of these viruses was strongly shaped by geographical boundaries. The association index statistics demonstrated a strong spatial structure within the island group, indicating that the seas were a significant geographical barrier for viral dispersal. Strong spatial structure was also observed even at a regional level, and most of the viral migrations (79. 7 % of the total median number) in Luzon were observed between neighboring regions. Rabies viruses were genetically clustered at a regional level, and this strong spatial structure suggests a geographical clustering of transmission chains and the potential effectiveness of rabies control that targets geographical clustering. Dog vaccination campaigns have been conducted independently by local governments in the Philippines, but it could be more effective to implement a coordinated vaccination campaign among neighboring areas to eliminate geographically-clustered rabies transmission chains...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Rabies {{continues}} to be a major public health problem in the Philippines, where 200 - 300 human cases were reported annually between 2001 and 2011. Understanding the phylogeography of <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> is important for establishing a more effective and feasible control strategy. METHODS: We performed a molecular analysis of <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> in the Philippines using rabied animal brain samples. The samples were collected from 11 of 17 regions, which covered three island groups (Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao). Partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequencing was performed on 57 samples and complete glycoprotein (G) gene sequencing was performed on 235 samples collected between 2004 and 2010. RESULTS: The Philippine strains of <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> were included in a distinct phylogenetic cluster, previously named Asian 2 b, which appeared to have diverged from the Chinese strain named Asian 2 a. The Philippine strains were further divided into three major clades, which were found exclusively in different island groups: clades L, V, and M in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, respectively. Clade L was subdivided into nine subclades (L 1 -L 9) and clade V was subdivided into two subclades (V 1 and V 2). With a few exceptions, most strains in each subclade were distributed in specific geographic areas. There were also four strains that were divided into two genogroups but were not classified into any of the three major clades, and all four strains were found in the island group of Luzon. CONCLUSION: We detected three major clades and two distinct genogroups of <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> in the Philippines. Our data suggest that viruses of each clade and subclade evolved independently in each area without frequent introduction into other areas. An important implication of these data is that geographically targeted dog vaccination using the island group approach may effectively control rabies in the Philippines...|$|R
25|$|During lethal rabies {{infection}} of mice, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) {{does not allow}} anti-viral immune cells to enter the brain, the primary site of <b>rabies</b> <b>virus</b> replication. This aspect contributes to the pathogenicity of the virus and artificially increasing BBB permeability promotes viral clearance. Opening the BBB during rabies infection has been suggested as a possible novel approach to treating the disease, even though no attempts have yet been made {{to determine whether or}} not this treatment could be successful.|$|E
25|$|Rhabdoviruses are {{a diverse}} family of single stranded, {{negative}} sense RNA viruses that infect {{a wide range}} of hosts, from plants and insects, to fish and mammals. The Rhaboviridae family consists of six genera, two of which, cytorhabdoviruses and nucleorhabdoviruses, only infect plants. Novirhabdoviruses infect fish, and vesiculovirus, lyssavirus and ephemerovirus infect mammals, fish and invertebrates. The family includes pathogens such as <b>rabies</b> <b>virus,</b> vesicular stomatitis virus and potato yellow dwarf virus that are of public health, veterinary, and agricultural significance.|$|E

Various species of poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins through their flesh. There are also numerous parasites and disease vectors. Vampire bats dwell in the rainforest and can spread the <b>rabies</b> <b>virus.</b> Malaria, yellow fever and Dengue fever can also be contracted in the Amazon region.|$|E
40|$|Rabies was undetected in {{terrestrial}} wildlife {{of northern}} Arizona until 2001, when rabies was diagnosed in 19 rabid skunks in Flagstaff.

40|$|Rabies {{isolates}} {{that had}} been stored between 1983 and 1997 were examined with a panel of anti-lyssavirus nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies. Out of 56 isolates from cats and various wild carnivore species, 1 isolate of Mokola virus and 5 other non-typical <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> were identified. The Mokola virus isolate was diagnosed as rabies in 1993 from a cat. Genetic analysis of this isolate suggests that it falls in a distinct subgroup of the Mokola virus genotype. The 5 non-typical <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> were isolated from honey badgers (Mellivora capensis), African civets (Civettictis civetta) and an unidentified mongoose (Herpestidae). These isolates are representatives of rarely-reported wildlife-associated strains of rabies, probably maintained by the slender mongoose (Galerella sanguinea). These findings indicate that both Mokola virus and the mongoose-associated variant may be more common in Zimbabwe than is apparent from routine surveillance...|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} 2000 - 2003, wild grey foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) in {{northern}} Colombia became infected with rabies. In order to derive phylogenetic relationships between <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> isolated in foxes, dogs and humans in this region, 902 nt cDNA fragments containing the G-L intergenic region and encoding the cytoplasmic domain of protein G and {{a fragment of}} protein L were obtained by RT-PCR, sequenced and compared. Phylogenetic analysis showed that <b>rabies</b> <b>viruses</b> isolated in foxes, dogs and humans belonged to a single genetic variant. Speculative analysis together with epidemiological data indicated that rabies in foxes {{may have been due}} to contact with rabid dogs. Rabies transmission between dogs, wild foxes and humans may happen in natural conditions in northern Colombia. This finding is the first to suggest dog-to-fox rabies transmission in South America, and provides another example of dog rabies variants being able to successfully colonize wildlife hosts...|$|R
25|$|Viruses often mimic human SLiMs {{to hijack}} and disrupt a host's {{cellular}} machinery, thereby adding functionality to their compact genomes without necessitating new virally encoded proteins. In fact, many motifs were originally discovered in viruses, {{such as the}} Retinoblastoma binding LxCxE motif and the UEV domain binding PTAP late domain. The short generation times and high mutation rates of viruses, in association with natural selection, has led to multiple examples of mimicry of host SLiMs in {{every step of the}} viral life cycle (Src binding motif PxxP in Nef modulates replication, WW domain binding PPxY mediates budding in Ebola virus, A Dynein Light Chain binding motif in <b>Rabies</b> <b>virus</b> is vital for host infection). The extent of human SLiM mimicry is surprising with many viral proteins containing several functional SLiMs, for example, the Adenovirus protein E1A.|$|E
25|$|Viruses within similar hosts, such as hosts that {{reside in}} the same {{geographic}} region, {{are expected to be}} more closely related genetically if transmission occurs more commonly between them. The phylogenies of measles and <b>rabies</b> <b>virus</b> (caricatured by figure 2A) illustrate viruses with strong spatial structure. These phylogenies stand in contrast to the phylogeny of human influenza, which does not appear to exhibit strong spatial structure over extended periods of time. Clustering of taxa, when it occurs, is not necessarily observed at all scales, and a population that appears structured at some scale may appear panmictic at another scale, for example at a smaller spatial scale. While spatial structure is the most commonly observed population structure in phylodynamic analyses, viruses may also have nonrandom admixture by attributes such as the age, race, and risk behavior. This is because viral transmission can preferentially occur between hosts sharing any of these attributes.|$|E
25|$|Although {{these three}} phylogenetic {{features}} are useful rules of thumb to identify epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes {{that might be}} impacting viral genetic variation, there is growing recognition that the mapping between process and phylogenetic pattern can be many-to-one. For instance, although ladder-like trees {{such as the one}} shown in figure 3A could reflect the presence of directional selection, ladder-like trees could also reflect sequential genetic bottlenecks that might occur with rapid spatial spread, {{as in the case of}} <b>rabies</b> <b>virus.</b> Because of this many-to-one mapping between process and phylogenetic pattern, research in the field of viral phylodynamics has sought to develop and apply quantitative methods to effectively infer process from reconstructed viral phylogenies (see Methods). The consideration of other data sources (e.g., incidence patterns) may aid in distinguishing between competing phylodynamic hypotheses. Combining disparate sources of data for phylodynamic analysis remains a major challenge in the field and is an active area of research.|$|E

RABV glycoprotein (G) lentiviral pseudotypes (PV) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific when used as surrogates for live virus in neutralisation assays. However, using wildtype AL RABV glycoprotein failed to generate any infectious PV. Therefore, we sought to determine if it was possible to increase the biological titre of AL RABV PV through the construction of chimeric RABV and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G. Initial studies were undertaken to generate a chimeric G by splicing the ecto-and transmembrane domains of an Indian AL RABV G strain with the cytoplasmic domain of VSV G. PV were produced using wildtype and chimeric G, revealing a 125 fold increase in titre for the chimeric G PV. Similar mutations were undertaken with other AL RABV allowing the efficacy of current animal vaccines to be tested against this subset of RABV...|$|R

500|$|Bats {{present a}} {{significant}} hazard {{in areas where}} the <b>rabies</b> <b>virus</b> is endemic.

Rabies is fully preventable if the patient is vaccinated before the onset of symptoms, but bat bites are small and may remain unnoticed. The most severe threat to humans and domestic animals comes from sick, downed, or dead bats.
