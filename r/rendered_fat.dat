50|$|Boiling down is {{the process}} of <b>rendering</b> <b>fat</b> from animal {{carcasses}} to produce tallow. It was a common small-farm activity for making soap and candles for domestic use, but was industrialised in the early 19th century, particularly in Australia.|$|R
2500|$|Even before Mexico {{gained control}} of Alta California in 1821, the onerous Spanish rules in effect from 1770 to 1821 against trading with foreigners began to break down as the declining Spanish fleet couldn't enforce their no trading policies. The Californios, with {{essentially}} no industries or manufacturing capabilities, were eager to trade for new commodities, glass, hinges, nails, finished goods, luxury goods and other merchandise. The Mexican government abolished the no trade with foreign ships policy and soon regular trading trips were being made. The main products of these California Ranchos were cow hides (called California greenbacks), tallow (<b>rendered</b> <b>fat</b> for making candles and soap) and California/Texas longhorn cattle horns that were traded for other finished goods and merchandise. This hide-and-tallow trade was mainly carried on by Boston-based ships that traveled for about 200 days in sailing ships about [...] to [...] around Cape Horn to bring finished goods and merchandise to trade with the Californio Ranchos for their hides, tallow and horns. The cattle and horses that provided the hides, tallow and horns essentially grew wild. The Californios' hides, tallow and horns provided the necessary trade articles for a mutually beneficial trade. The first United States, English and Russian trading ships began showing up in California before 1816. The classic book Two Years Before the Mast by Richard Henry Dana, Jr. written about 1832 provides a good first hand account of this trade., ...|$|E

50|$|Schmaltz (also spelled schmalz or shmalz) is {{rendered}} (clarified) chicken or goose fat used for frying or as a spread on bread in Central European cuisine, {{and in the}} United States, particularly identified with Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine. <b>Rendered</b> waterfowl <b>fat</b> is also used in the cuisine of Southwestern France. As an effect of cross-cultural influences of the Jewish Ashkenazi, Polish, and Ukrainian cuisine, it is also popular in Poland and Ukraine, where <b>rendered</b> <b>fats</b> (including lard) are called smalec, with schmaltz derived from geese being popular as gęsi smalec.|$|R

40|$|Biodiesel is a fuel {{consisting}} of the alkyl monoesters of fatty acids from vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel is receiving increasing attention as an alternative, non-toxic, biodegradable and renewable diesel fuel. Many {{studies have shown that}} the properties of biodiesel are very close to diesel fuel. Therefore, biodiesel can be used in diesel engines with little or no modification.;Biodiesel is usually produced from food-grade vegetable oils that are more expensive than diesel fuel. Therefore, use of biodiesel produced from food-grade vegetable oil may be limited to cases of severe shortages or emergencies. However, lower cost feedstocks are available. <b>Rendered</b> animal <b>fats</b> and restaurant waste oils are an attractive source to produce biodiesel. The problem with processing <b>rendered</b> <b>fats</b> and oils is that they usually contain large amounts of free fatty acids that cannot be converted to biodiesel using an alkaline catalyst due to the formation of soaps. An alternative way is to use acid catalysts, which are more tolerant of free fatty acids.;The objective of this study was to develop a process to utilize <b>rendered</b> <b>fats,</b> known as yellow grease, as a biodiesel feedstock and to build a pilot plant to implement this process. The pilot plant was successfully constructed and was shown to be capable of processing <b>rendered</b> <b>fats</b> containing 40 % free fatty acids.;After preparing a sufficient amount of biodiesel from <b>rendered</b> animal <b>fats</b> and restaurant waste oils, the impact of the biodiesel on diesel engine exhaust emissions and engine performance was evaluated and compared to No. 2 diesel fuel and soybean oil methyl ester. The methyl esters produced from yellow grease gave nearly the same thermal efficiency but higher fuel consumption compared with No. 2 diesel fuel. At the operating condition studied, the biodiesel produced 17. 77 % and 46. 27 % lower CO and HC emissions, respectively, than No. 2 diesel fuel. The Bosch Smoke Number for biodiesel from yellow grease was 64. 21 % less than with No. 2 diesel fuel. The methyl esters had 11. 60 % higher NOx emissions than the No. 2 diesel fuel. No significant differences were found in the exhaust emissions and engine performance between the biodiesel produced from yellow grease and biodiesel from soybean oil...|$|R
25|$|The {{history of}} {{chemistry}} represents a time span from ancient {{history to the}} present.

40|$|Problem statement: In the past, aquafeeds were {{comprised}} {{largely of}} fish meal and fish oil derived from marine reduction fisheries. In {{addition to being}} highly palatable and readily digested by cultured fishes, these feedstuffs were historically inexpensive sources of protein, energy and essential nutrients. However, increasing cost and concerns over safety and sustainability have greatly incentivized the transition from fish meal and oil to alternative sources of protein and lipid for aquafeed formulation. Fish oil replacement is proving more difficult than originally anticipated, particularly for marine carnivorous species. Approach: If complete fish oil replacement is not a viable goal for fish nutritionists and aquafeed manufacturers, at a minimum, we must strive for judicious use of limited marine-derived resources. In the present review, we explore the opportunities of using <b>rendered</b> <b>fats</b> as alternatives to marine-derived fish oils in aquaculture feeds, beginning {{with a discussion of}} the products themselves before reviewing the most recent literature and concluding with a discussion of the future of these products in aquafeed formulations. Results: <b>Rendered</b> <b>fats</b> have not been as intensively evaluated in aquaculture nutrition as grain and oilseed-derived lipids, although a number of recent publications on the subject suggest increasing interest in the use of rendered products in aquafeeds. Conclusion: Poultry fat, beef tallow, pork lard and to a lesser extent, yellow/restaurant grease and catfish oil, have been investigated individually or in combination with other lipids in feeds for a broad range of cultured taxa with generally acceptable results...|$|R

50|$|Prior to cooking, {{the spices}} are rinsed from the meat, {{which is then}} patted dry. The meat is placed in a cooking dish deep enough to contain the meat and the <b>rendered</b> <b>fat,</b> and placed in an oven at a low {{temperature}} (76 - 135 degrees Celsius/170 - 275 Fahrenheit). The meat is slowly poached at least until cooked, or until meltingly tender, generally four to ten hours.|$|E
50|$|Overhead heat has the {{advantage}} of allowing foods containing fats, such as steaks, chops and other cuts of meat, to be grilled without the risk of flare-ups caused by the <b>rendered</b> <b>fat</b> dripping onto the heat source. The salamander's facility for extremely high temperature also takes less cooking time than other grilling techniques, reducing preparation time, which is a benefit in professional kitchens during a busy meal service.|$|E
50|$|Food {{preservation}} {{was either}} chemical or physical, as refrigeration did not exist. Meats and fish would be smoked, dried or kept on ice. Brine and salt {{were used to}} pickle items such as herring, and to cure pork. Root vegetables were preserved in brine after they had been parboiled. Other means of preservation included oil, vinegar or immersing meat in congealed, <b>rendered</b> <b>fat.</b> For preserving fruits, liquor, honey and sugar were used.|$|E
