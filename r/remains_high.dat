5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{is performed}} {{to measure the}} opening pressure, {{as well as to}} obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to exclude alternative diagnoses. If the opening pressure is increased, CSF may be removed for transient relief (see below). The CSF is examined for abnormal cells, infections, antibody levels, the glucose level, and protein levels. By definition, all of these are within their normal limits in IIH. Occasionally, the CSF pressure measurement may be normal despite very suggestive symptoms. This may be attributable to the fact that CSF pressure may fluctuate {{over the course of the}} normal day. If the suspicion of problems <b>remains</b> <b>high,</b> it may be necessary to perform more long-term monitoring of the ICP by a pressure catheter.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 2012, for {{the first}} time since September 2010, Ireland was able to return to the {{financial}} markets, selling over €5 billion in long-term government debt, with an interest rate of 5.9% for the 5-year bonds and 6.1% for the 8-year bonds at sale. In December 2013, after three years on financial life support, Ireland finally left the EU/IMF bailout programme, although it retained a debt of €22.5 billion to the IMF; in August 2014, early repayment of €15 billion was being considered, which would save the country €375 million in surcharges. Despite the end of the bailout the country's unemployment rate <b>remains</b> <b>high</b> and public sector wages are still around 20% lower than at the beginning of the crisis. Government debt reached 123.7% of GDP in 2013.|$|E

Because improved sanitation does not decrease the prevalence of rotaviral disease, {{and the rate of}} hospitalisations <b>remains</b> <b>high</b> despite the use of oral rehydrating medicines, the primary public health intervention is vaccination. Two vaccines against Rotavirus A infection are approved for global use and are safe and effective in children: Rotarix by GlaxoSmithKline and RotaTeq by Merck. Both are taken orally and contain attenuated live virus. Three vaccines are licensed for use in national markets only: ROTAVAC®, licensed in India in 2014; Rotavin-M1™, licensed in Vietnam in 2007; and Lanzhou Lamb Rotavirus Vaccine, licensed in China in 2000.

Other studies have suggested that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion. According to Edwin Reischauer and Marius Jansen, some 70–80% of the Japanese do not consider themselves believers in any religion. Nevertheless, the level of participation <b>remains</b> <b>high,</b> especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs. Japanese streets are decorated on Tanabata, Obon and Christmas.|$|E
