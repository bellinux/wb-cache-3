40|$|Out of the toolbox {{of survey}} methods for obtaining honest answers to {{sensitive}} issues, {{the method of}} <b>randomized</b> <b>responses</b> (RR) {{has proven to be}} the most effective one. So far, in applications of RR methods it has been assumed that they eliminate response biases. We investigate the validity of this assumption by applying multivariate RR models that allow for different types of response biases. Our data analyses show that RR methods do not eliminate response biases but that they can be modeled in informative ways: accounting for response biases leads to estimates that are at least twice the size of the estimates obtained when response biases are ignore...|$|R

Methods: Subjects were invited to participate in a simulated consent process for a study involving a genetic repository. Explanation of the research consent form by the computer agent was compared to explanation by a human and a self-study condition in a <b>randomized</b> trial. <b>Responses</b> were compared according to level of health literacy. Results: Participants were most satisfied with the consent process and most likely to sign the consent form when it was explained by the computer agent, regardless of health literacy level. Participants with adequate health literacy demonstrated the highest level of comprehension with the computer agent-based explanation compared to the other two conditions. However, participants with limited health literacy showed poor comprehension levels in all three conditions. Participants with limited health literacy reported several reasons, such as lack of time constraints, ability to re-ask questions, and lack of bias, for preferring the computer agent-based explanation over a human-based one.

40|$|Many RFID {{authentication}} protocols with <b>randomized</b> tag <b>response</b> {{have been}} proposed to avoid simple tag tracing. These protocols are symmetric in common {{due to the lack}} of computational power to perform expensive asymmetric cryptography calculations in low-cost tags. Protocols with constantly changing tag key have also been proposed to avoid more advanced tag tracing attacks. With both the symmetric and constant changing properties, tag and reader re-synchronization is unavoidable as the key of a tag can be made desynchronized with the reader due to offline attacks or incomplete protocol runs. In this paper, our contribution is to classify these synchronized RFID authentication protocols into different types and then examine their highest achievable levels of privacy protections using the privacy model proposed by Vaudenay in Asiacrypt 2007 and later extended by Ng et al. in ESORICS 2008. Our new privacy results show the separation between weak privacy and narrow-forward privacy in these protocols, which effectively fills themissing relationship of these two privacy levels in Vaudenay’s paper and answer the question raised by Paise and Vaudenay in ASIACCS 2008 on why they cannot find a candidate protocol that can achieve both privacy levels at the same time. We also show that forward privacy is impossible with these synchronized protocols...|$|R

Two studies using 10 volunteers were performed. In one trial, volunteers received a palatal infiltration opposite the second maxillary bicuspid on one side and a greater palatine nerve block on the other. Response to sharp probing and pain-pressure thresholds were measured on each side over a 1 -hour census period.

In this paper we study the all-logit dynamics, where at each time step all players concurrently update their strategies according to the logit choice function. In the well studied one-logit dynamics [7] instead at each step only one randomly chosen player is allowed to update. We study properties of the all-logit dynamics in the context of local interaction games, a class of games that has been used to model complex social phenomena [7, 23, 26] and physical systems [19]. In a local interaction game, players are the vertices of a social graph whose edges are two-player potential games. Each player picks one strategy to be played for all the games she is involved in and the payoff of the player is the (weighted) sum of the payoffs from each of the games. We prove that local interaction games characterize the class of games for which the all-logit dynamics are reversible. We then compare the stationary behavior of one-logit and all-logit dynamics.

The current study therefore aimed to explore the effects of Epo on neural and behavioral measures of hippocampal function in humans using a functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm. Volunteers were randomized to receive intravenous injection of Epo (40, 000 IU) or saline in a between-subjects, double-blind, <b>randomized</b> design.

Epo increased hippocampus response during picture retrieval (n = 11) compared with placebo (n = 12; p = 0. 04) independent of changes in hematocrit.
