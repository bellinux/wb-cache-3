40|$|AbstractThe {{perceived}} {{structure of}} a suprathreshold plaid made from two sinusoidal gratings tilted ± 45 deg from vertical usually resembles a blurred checkerboard. Physically increasing the tilt of the components away from vertical elongates the pattern horizontally, yielding <b>rectangular</b> <b>checks.</b> We asked whether illusory tilt of the components induced by adaptation to a vertical gratin would also give apparent elongation of the checks. Using a staircase method, we found that after adaptation the component orientations had to be set 3 – 4 deg closer to vertical to maintain a square, checkerboard-like appearance, implying that the ± 45 deg plaid did appear elongated. This result suggests that the tilt aftereffect adaptation not only distorts the orientation of 1 -D patterns but can also change the relative location of features, even when their orientation is not altered. This {{is not easy to}} explain within filter models that (often implicitly) assume each receptive field carries a fixed “local sign” indicating its position within the retinal array. We consider a representation in which localized patches of the image are encoded by the coefficients of a 2 -D Fourier-like transform. With a simple subtractive model of adaptation, we show that the spatial information carried by each patch would be distorted in just the way observed for plaids and gratings. The fact that perceived structure is both distorted and coherent, not fragmented, after adaptation suggests an additional, more global process whereby local patches are combined to form a coherent, composite “neural image”. We offer a simple principle that could establish this coherence. If the positions of local patches are adjusted so as to maximize the contrast energy of the composite image, then the spatial distortions of the patches (induced by selective adaptation) are carried through to the global structure of the composite. Thus, the conflict between channel codes and local signs is resolved, but perceptual distortion is the result...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{classical}} equation of motion of a radiating charged point particle (the Lorentz-Dirac equation) has ''tunneling'' solutions. For a given initial position and velocity we find that, contrary to common belief, several different physically acceptable solutions exist {{for a range of}} initial data. Both features are demonstrated for a <b>rectangular</b> barrier. To <b>check</b> that these phenomena are not dependent on the discontinuities of the potential, we also study in detail the solutions for a smoothened (single) potential step. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of artificial recharge by a rectangular basin was computed using an algorithm {{based on the}} finite-element method. Ground-water head and flux in the underlying aquifer system were calculated for the rectangular basin. In addition, head distributions also were computed for circular, square, hexagonal, and triangular recharge basins with equal area and for the same recharge rate as the rectangular basin. A lower ground-water mound buildup was found for higher-perimeter basin shapes and vice versa. Influence of variation in hydraulic conductivity beneath the recharge basin due to gradual clogging of the aquifer pore spaces was investigated and the mass balance for the <b>rectangular</b> basin was <b>checked.</b> Time variant analysis computed a time of 82. 3 days to stabilize the mound. The buildup was higher initially followed by a much slower growth as steady state was approached...|$|R
