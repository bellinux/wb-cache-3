500|$|In June 2007, YouTube began {{trials of}} a system for {{automatic}} detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits {{such as the one}} from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did {{not have the right to}} distribute. The system, which became known as Content ID, creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found. When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video. YouTube describes Content ID as [...] "very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to <b>reference</b> <b>files</b> that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective ID File". Content ID accounts for over a third of the monetized views on YouTube.|$|E

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{has been}} developed for estimating the information content of retrieval systems with binary-coded mass spectra, as well as mass spectra coded by other methods, from the statistical properties of a <b>reference</b> <b>file.</b> For a <b>reference</b> <b>file,</b> binary-coded with a threshold of 1 % of {{the intensity of the}} base peak, this results typically in an estimated information content of about 50 bits for 200 selected m/z values. It is shown that, because of errors occurring in the binary-coded spectra, the actual information content is only about 12 bits.

50|$|Soundtrack Pro is {{designed}} to be used in combination with Final Cut Pro, both of which are included in the Final Cut Studio box set. It supports a 'roundtrip' workflow, in which Final Cut Pro sequences can be exported as small <b>reference</b> <b>files</b> that include scoring markers. These <b>reference</b> <b>files</b> are then dragged from Soundtrack Pro's Browser tab to the video pane. The video track includes thumbnails of the video at each scoring marker (not where there were scene breaks in Final Cut). Once the soundtrack is finished, it is exported as a mix (i.e. all the tracks are flattened together) and can then be imported into Final Cut. If the soundtrack needs to be changed, the Soundtrack Pro project file can be re-opened at any time, but the changes will only show up in Final Cut when the mix has been re-exported (to the same file).|$|E
