The word literally means [...] "Italian stuff" [...] because Queen Bona Sforza, who was Italian and married Polish King Sigismund I the Old in 1518, introduced this concept to Poland. A włoszczyzna may consist of carrots, parsnips or parsley <b>root,</b> <b>celery</b> <b>root</b> or celeriac, leeks, and savoy or white cabbage leaves, and sometimes celery leaves and flat-leaf parsley. The most typical, packaged combination is <b>celery</b> <b>root,</b> parsley root, carrots, and leeks. Włoszczyzna is usually tied up and boiled {{to form a}} flavour base for soups and stews.|$|R

The study was carried out on <b>root</b> <b>celery</b> - Apium graveolens L. var. rapaceum (Mill.) and stalk celery - Apium graveolens L. var. dulce (Mill.). The results obtained in these experiments point to the following conclusions: it was found that potassium and sodium mutually limit each other's uptake. Sodium was more antagonistic towards the uptake of calcium than was potassium. However, no clearly antagonistic effect of these elements on the uptake of magnesium was determined. The accumulation of potassium and sodium by the experimental plants rose while the percentage of utilization of these elements decreased as their level in the nutrient medium increased.

40|$|The study {{presented}} in this paper was concerned with the search for a method for determination of the temporal and spatial distribution of the intensity of water intake by celeriac roots. A field experiment carried out permitted the demonstration of the applicability of the TDR technique for the determination of the dynamics of moisture in the active layer of soil surrounding celeriac roots. Knowledge of the dynamics was used to design a water balance in which the only unknown was the amount of water taken up by the crop under study. It was found that water intake by celeriac roots takes place primarily close to the axis of symmetry of the plant, in the layer immediately adjacent to the main root. Moreover, it was found that approx. 90 % of water is taken in by the plant during the daylight period. The information may be treated as indicative in the design of irrigation systems placement – e. g. of drip-irrigation lines, and of the timing of their operation. Ultimately, it was demonstrated that drip-irrigation lines should be located {{as close as possible to}} the centre point of celeriac roots and coincide as much as possible with the axis of symmetry of the plant, and that the irrigation systems should be turned on only during the daytime.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pressure}} alterations on the yield of CO 2, extracts from different anatomical parts of lovage (Levisticum officinale Koch.) and celery (Apium graveolens L.) was studied.

Vegetables were purchased at the local markets in Budapest at a period of their most frequent consumption. Quercetin levels in the edible parts of most vegetables were generally below 10 mg kg- 1, except for onions (67 - 121. 5 mg kg- 1), lettuce (13. 5 - 35. 0 mg kg- 1), dill (74. 5 mg kg- 1), broccoli (15. 5 mg kg- 1) and spinach (272. 2 mg kg- 1). Kaempferol was below 30 mg kg- 1 except for parsnip (66. 4 mg kg- 1) and leek (45. 8 mg kg- 1). Myricetin could only be detected in lettuce, Swedish turnip, parsley and celery leaves, and dill. Detectable amount of luteolin was in radishes, some representatives of Brassica, sweet peppers, celery leaves and spinach while apigenin was only in Swedish turnip, <b>celery</b> <b>root</b> and <b>celery</b> leaves.
