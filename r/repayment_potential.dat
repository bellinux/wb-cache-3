50|$|Overcapitalisation {{is closely}} related (in causes and consequences) to assets inflation. As the {{financialisation}} of the economy {{has led to the}} monetisation (also called ‘securitisation’) of many non-financial assets, such as real estate, infrastructures, etc., overcapitalisation has become rife, with deleterious consequences at the level of firms (struggling to achieve an unrealistically high level of profitability), households (struggling to pay their inflated mortgage), and individuals (whose equity holding, and hence borrowing and <b>repayment</b> <b>potential,</b> may be vastly over-valued).|$|E
40|$|Bank {{privatization}} and tighter credit enforcement are believed indispensable {{to facilitate the}} Eastern European transition process. We analyze lending by value-maximizing banks, {{the only source of}} capital in the transition, faced by non-performing loans to the state-owned sector. We show that banks have a perverse incentive to fund former debtors, although less efficient and more risky than private firms, because they gain the <b>potential</b> <b>repayment</b> of previous debts. This leads to a lower productivity of investment and a greater concentration of risk; the expansion of more efficient private firms is delayed, leading to a slower recovery and a greater risk of financial crisis...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the true}} {{scale of the}} {{difficulties}} in the Irish mortgage market is of key importance from a financial stability, fiscal and social perspective. To date, much of the analysis and discussion of the Irish market has {{tended to focus on}} either the concept of mortgage <b>repayment</b> distress or <b>potential</b> negative equity. However, the combination of these two factors raises fundamental policy issues. Building on earlier work, which used the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), we marry existing estimates of repayment distress with estimates of negative equity for a representative sample of Irish households. Using copula modelling we then examine the dependence structure across the distributions of mortgage delinquency and solvency for these households. As a result, we {{are in a position to}} estimate the probability that a household experiencing repayment distress might also be in negative equity. Credit, Solvency, Delinquency, Copula...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "As {{an important part of}} the economic stimulus efforts, Congress enacted the First- Time Homebuyer Credit (FTHBC) to assist the struggling real estate market and encourage taxpayers to purchase their first homes. Congress enacted different versions of the FTHBC [...] as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (Housing Act); the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act); and the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (Assistance Act). The dollar amounts that can be claimed and rules associated with the credit, including <b>potential</b> <b>repayment,</b> vary depending on the version. Joint Committee on Taxation estimates suggest that the three FTHBC provisions combined may result in total revenue losses to the federal government of about $ 22 billion through 2019. In response to the request for updated information on the use of the FTHBC, our objectives were to identify (1) the number of FTHBC claims and dollar amounts claimed for each credit version by state and (2) state rankings, using selected statistics, such as the total dollar amount of FTHBC claimed in each state. ...|$|R
40|$|Farmers use credit from {{commercial}} credit providers to finance production activities. Commercial credit providers have {{to predict the}} financial sustainability of the enterprise {{to ensure that the}} borrower will have the ability to repay the loan. A Delphi study was conducted to explore what factors are used as indicators of loan-repayment ability of farmers. The objective was not only to identify factors that are currently considered, but also to identify other personal attributes that may improve the accuracy in predicting the <b>repayment</b> ability of <b>potential</b> borrowers. The Delphi was applied to a panel consisting of nine credit analysts and credit managers from a commercial credit provider in South Africa. The results indicate that the current and past financial performance, account standing, collateral, and credit record of the farm are very important in the assessment of applications in terms of financial performance. Experience and the success factors compared to competitors were found to be important, while age and education/qualification are regarded as less important in predicting repayment ability. The results also show that, although not currently objectively included in credit evaluations, credit analysis regards leadership and human relations; commitment and confidence; internal locus of control; self-efficacy; calculated risk taking; need for achievement; and opportunity seeking as important indicators of the ability of potential borrows to repay their loans. Thus, credit analysts and managers also regard management abilities and entrepreneurial characteristics of potential borrowers to be good indicators of repayment ability. Results from this research provide new indicator factors {{that can be used to}} extend existing credit evaluation instruments in order to more accurately predict repayment ability...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Between 2001 and 2004, an average of more than 1. 5 million people annually filed for personal bankruptcy protection. In April 2005, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (Reform Act) was enacted, in part, to address certain factors viewed as contributing to an escalation in bankruptcy filings. Described as representing the most comprehensive set of reforms in more than 25 years, the Reform Act, among other things, requires those filers {{with the ability to}} pay some of their debts from future earnings to enter into repayment plans under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code instead of liquidating their assets under Chapter 7 and granting the debtor a discharge from eligible debts. Individuals usually file for bankruptcy under one of two chapters of the Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 13, filers submit a repayment plan to the court agreeing to pay part or all of their debts over time, usually 3 to 5 years. Under Chapter 7, the filer's eligible assets are reduced to cash and distributed to creditors in accordance with distribution priorities and procedures set out in the Bankruptcy Code. A large majority of cases filed under Chapter 7 have no assets available for liquidation, and thus no funds are available to pay creditors. Upon the successful completion of both Chapter 7 and 13 cases, the filer's personal liability for eligible debts is discharged {{at the end of the}} bankruptcy process, which means that creditors may take no further action against the individual to collect the debt. Bankruptcy filers may choose to reaffirm a debt, often for those debts secured by collateral, such as a home or a car. A reaffirmation agreement, generally filed under Chapter 7, formalizes this arrangement, whereby a filer with debts secured by collateral retains the collateral and continues to make debt payments to a creditor. Congress has expressed interest in learning whether the Reform Act has had or is likely to have an effect on bankruptcy filers who have a child support obligation and their ability to make these payments. Obligation refers to an amount owed or promised for payment, whereas payment refers to the act of paying or state of being paid. Child support obligations can be for past due child support, current support, or medical support. Past due child support refers to a debt owed by a noncustodial parent to, for example, a custodial parent or guardian for past child support owed but not paid. In contrast, current child support obligations reflect ongoing child support obligations. In the bankruptcy filing documents, a filer is to report past due child support and current child support expenses. Unpaid child support obligations are not discharged through bankruptcy. To request relief from debt, individuals file a petition, financial statements, and schedules (including information about child support obligations), among other things, with the bankruptcy court. In this report, we refer to all documents filed with the court as bankruptcy filing documents. Congressional interest stemmed from concerns that amendments made by the Reform Act that require certain debtors to enter into Chapter 13 <b>repayment</b> plans or <b>potential</b> pressure from creditors to reaffirm debts might affect the ability of bankruptcy filers to pay past due child support or ongoing child support obligations. This report discusses issues related to our inability to assess the potential impact of the Reform Act on child support payments as well as information on bankruptcy filers who have child support obligations. Specifically, this report addresses (1) difficulties in determining the potential effect of the Reform Act on an individual's ability to pay child support and (2) an agency proposal regarding the use of data-enabled forms [...] documents with embedded, invisible data tags that facilitate the extraction of data for analysis [...] to alleviate some of these difficulties. ...|$|R
