40|$|During {{production}} proteins {{are exposed}} to various stresses which can cause protein denaturation and inactivation. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of shear forces which can occur during filling operations of pharmaceutical solutions with dosing equipment. Such shear forces possibly have a negative influence on shear sensitive substances and may lower the quality and yield of the final drug product. In the scope of this work a peristaltic pump and different sizes of <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pumps (RPPs) were compared in respect to induced protein aggregation due to shear damage caused by dosing equipment. The influence of various parameters such as filling speed, dosing volume, friction surface and exposure to air-liquid interfaces and on the intensity of the shear stress was examined. A characteristic <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pump parameter δ was developed and introduced as an indicator describing the potential of a <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pump to cause protein damage. Furthermore, excipients were tested on their ability to protect the model protein against shear-induced damage. 2 model proteins in solution, lactase (β-galactosidase) and rituximab, a recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody, were used and tested for their suitability as model proteins. No activity loss was seen for the sheared lactase solution, therefore finally rituximab was chosen as a model protein. The level of protein aggregation in the unsheared and sheared solutions was determined by Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) and SEC-HPLC. TEM was used to visualise protein aggregation. It was found that protein aggregation was induced by <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pumps however not by the peristaltic pump. The degree of protein damage was marginally low for large <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pumps such as RPP 3 and 4 and showed a considerable increase with smaller sizes like RPP 1 and 2.

25|$|A third design, {{for a small}} {{unmanned}} version {{powered by}} a single Gnome <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> engine, was constructed in 1918. It was intended to carry meteorological (weather) instruments or radio antennas aloft, {{but it is not}} known whether it ever flew.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other rotary engines, the Di Pietro motor uses {{a simple}} {{cylindrical}} <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> (shaft driver) which rolls, with next to no friction, inside the cylindrical stator.Only 1 psi (≈ 6,8 kPa) of pressure {{is needed to}} overcome the friction.|$|R
50|$|A pistonless {{rotary engine}} is an {{internal}} combustion engine that does not use pistons {{in the way a}} reciprocating engine does, but instead uses one or more s, sometimes called <b>rotary</b> <b>pistons.</b> An example of a pistonless rotary engine is the Wankel engine.|$|R

The test gas is unsteadily compressed and heated thus reducing the thermal loads to the walls.

5000|$|An {{electropneumatic}} hammer {{is often}} called a [...] "rotary hammer," [...] because it has an electric motor, which rotates a crank. The hammer has two pistons—a <b>drive</b> <b>piston</b> and a free flight piston. The crank moves the <b>drive</b> <b>piston</b> {{back and forth in}} the same cylinder as the flight <b>piston.</b> The <b>drive</b> <b>piston</b> never touches the flight <b>piston.</b> Instead the <b>drive</b> <b>piston</b> compresses air in the cylinder, which then propels the flight piston against a striker, which contacts the drill bit.|$|R
