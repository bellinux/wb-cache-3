2500|$|MC {{firms have}} {{some degree of}} market power. Market power means that the firm has control over the terms and {{conditions}} of exchange. An MC firm can raise its prices without losing all its customers. The firm can also lower prices without triggering a potentially <b>ruinous</b> <b>price</b> war with competitors. The source of an MC firm's market power is not barriers to entry since they are low. Rather, an MC firm has market power because it has relatively few competitors, those competitors do not engage in strategic decision making and the firms sells differentiated product. Market power also means that an MC firm faces a downward sloping demand curve. The demand curve is highly elastic although not [...] "flat".|$|E

He {{told me he had}} got some bread, but that meat was at a <b>ruinous</b> <b>price.</b> I told him that he must get it, {{whatever}} price it was, and I expect by this time he has done so; so if you look sharp, you will get to the boat before it puts off with him." ...|$|E
60|$|Rachel did {{not give}} up her hopes of fixing the asylum near her till after a {{considerable}} effort to get a house for it at Avonmouth, but this was far from easy. The Curtises' unwillingness to part with land for building purposes enhanced the price of houses, and in autumn and winter the place was at its fullest, {{so that she could}} not even rent a house but at a <b>ruinous</b> <b>price.</b> It would {{be the best way to}} build on Homestead land, but this would be impracticable until spring, even if means were forthcoming, as Rachel resolved they should be, and in the meantime she was obliged to acquiesce in Mr. Mauleverer's assurance that a small house in an overbuilt portion of St. Norbert's would be more eligible than one in some inland parish. Anything was better than delay. Mr. Mauleverer was to superintend from his lodgings.|$|E
5000|$|A {{shift in}} the {{economic}} dominance of grain farming over cattle raising was marked by {{the passage of the}} California [...] "No-Fence Law" [...] of 1874. This repealed the Trespass Act of 1850, which had required farmers to protect their planted fields from free-ranging cattle. The repeal of the Trespass Act required that ranchers fence stock in, rather than farmers fencing cattle out. The ranchers were faced with either the high expense of fencing large grazing tracts or selling their cattle at <b>ruinous</b> <b>prices.</b>|$|R
60|$|The striving {{after this}} peerage I {{considered}} to {{have been one of}} the most unlucky of all my unlucky dealings at this period. I made unheard-of sacrifices to bring it about. I lavished money here and diamonds there. I bought lands at ten times their value; purchased pictures and articles of vertu at <b>ruinous</b> <b>prices.</b> I gave repeated entertainments to those friends to my claims who, being about the Royal person, were likely to advance it. I lost many a bet to the Royal Dukes His Majesty's brothers; but let these matters be forgotten, and, because of my private injuries, let me not be deficient in loyalty to my Sovereign.|$|R

Every man you met had his new mine to boast of, and his [...] "specimens" [...] ready; and if the opportunity offered, he would infallibly back you into a corner and offer {{as a favor to}} you, not to him, to part with just a few feet in the [...] "Golden Age," [...] or the [...] "Sarah Jane," [...] or some other unknown stack of croppings, for money enough to get a [...] "square meal" [...] with, as the phrase went. And you were never to reveal that he had made you the offer at such a <b>ruinous</b> <b>price,</b> for it was only out of friendship for you {{that he was willing to}} make the sacrifice. Then he would fish a piece of rock out of his pocket, and after looking mysteriously around as if he feared he might be waylaid and robbed if caught with such wealth in his possession, he would dab the rock against his tongue, clap an eyeglass to it, and exclaim: ...|$|E
60|$|Barnet saw {{the last}} days of the coal-steam engines upon the English {{railways}} and the gradual cleansing of the London atmosphere as the smoke-creating sea-coal fires gave place to electric heating. The building of laboratories at Kensington was still in progress, and he took part in the students' riots that delayed the removal of the Albert Memorial. He carried a banner with 'We like Funny Statuary' on one side, and on the other 'Seats and Canopies for Statues, Why should our Great Departed Stand in the Rain?' He learnt the rather athletic aviation of those days at the University grounds at Sydenham, and he was fined for flying over the new prison for political libellers at Wormwood Scrubs, 'in a manner calculated to exhilarate the prisoners while at exercise.' That was the time of the attempted suppression of any criticism of the public judicature and the place was crowded with journalists who had ventured to call attention to the dementia of Chief Justice Abrahams. Barnet was not a very good aviator, he confesses he was always a little afraid of his machine--there was excellent reason for every one to be afraid of those clumsy early types--and he never attempted steep descents or very high flying. He also, he records, owned one of those oil-driven motor-bicycles whose clumsy complexity and extravagant filthiness still astonish the visitors to the museum of machinery at South Kensington. He mentions running over a dog and complains of the <b>ruinous</b> <b>price</b> of 'spatchcocks' in Surrey. 'Spatchcocks,' it seems, was a slang term for crushed hens.|$|E

6000|$|The State {{will not}} even insist that a {{sufficiency}} of comfortable, sanitary homes shall be built for his class; if he wants the elementary convenience of a bathroom, he must pay extra toll to the water shareholder; his gas is as cheap in quality and dear in price as it can be; his bread and milk, under the laws of supply and demand, are at the legal minimum of wholesomeness; the coal trade cheerfully raises his coal in mid-winter to <b>ruinous</b> <b>prices.</b> He buys clothes of shoddy and boots of brown paper. To get any other is nearly impossible {{for a man with}} three hundred pounds a year. His newspapers, which are supported by advertisers and financiers, in order to hide the obvious injustice of this one-man-fight against the allied forces of property, din in his ears that his one grievance is local taxation, his one remedy [...] "to keep down the rates"--the [...] "rates" [...] which do at least repair his roadway, police his streets, give him open spaces for his babies and help to educate his children, and which, moreover, constitute a burthen he might by a little intelligent political action shift quite easily from his own shoulders to the broad support of capital and land.|$|R
40|$|The meat {{sector is}} the largest branch in the German food economy. It is {{characterized}} by a dominance of cost leadership. Against the background of an increasingly <b>ruinous</b> predatory <b>pricing</b> policy, we analyze the potential of brands introduced into new markets by brand extension. Therefore, consumption-psychological (strength of the parent brand, perceived quality of the parent brand, perceived transfer-fit) as well as economic (conjoint analysis) approaches are applied. The results reveal a group of 25 % of consumers who show a price inelastic buying behaviour and who {{can be seen as a}} suitable target group for manufacturerâ€™s brands. The example of the poultry brand Wiesenhof shows that brand extensions are an appropriate tool to introduce brands into the financially weak red meat sector. brand transfer, meat sector, consumer behaviour, conjoint analysis, Agribusiness, Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R
5000|$|Interdependence: The {{distinctive}} feature of an oligopoly is interdependence. Oligopolies are typically {{composed of a}} few large firms. Each firm is so large that its actions affect market conditions. Therefore, the competing firms will be aware of a firm's market actions and will respond appropriately. This means that in contemplating a market action, a firm must {{take into consideration the}} possible reactions of all competing firms and the firm's countermoves. It is very much like a game of chess, in which a player must anticipate a whole sequence of moves and countermoves in order to determine how to achieve his or her objectives; this is known as game theory. For example, an oligopoly considering a price reduction may wish to estimate the likelihood that competing firms would also lower their prices and possibly trigger a <b>ruinous</b> <b>price</b> war. Or if the firm is considering a price increase, it may want to know whether other firms will also increase prices or hold existing prices constant. This anticipation leads to price rigidity as firms will be only be willing to adjust their prices and quantity of output in accordance with a [...] "price leader" [...] in the market. This high degree of interdependence and {{need to be aware of}} what other firms are doing or might do is to be contrasted with lack of interdependence in other market structures. In a perfectly competitive (PC) market there is zero interdependence because no firm is large enough to affect market price. All firms in a PC market are price takers, as current market selling price can be followed predictably to maximize short-term profits. In a monopoly, there are no competitors to be concerned about. In a monopolistically-competitive market, each firm's effects on market conditions is so negligible as to be safely ignored by competitors.|$|E
40|$|In [2], it {{is shown}} that pricing of {{e-services}} may {{more often than}} not lead to <b>ruinous</b> <b>price</b> wars. We show that this undesirable result need not occur, and does not follow in most cases when the model underlying the Nash game is sufficiently general. By adding a Quality of Service (QoS) term to the payoff function of each provider, we analyze resulting price equilibria for a number of different hypotheses on user behavior. Further, we consider both single-tier and two-tier pricing, as practiced currently by a major web hosting service provider...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the existence and}} implications of competitive equilibria when two firms offer the same electronic goods under different pricing policies. One charges a fixed subscription fee per period; the other charges on a per-use basis. Two models are examined when firms' marginal costs are negligible and they can revise prices periodically. Both show that competition often leads to <b>ruinous</b> <b>price</b> wars {{in the absence of}} collusion. However, stable pricing equilibria exist in special cases. The findings are robust even when customers are willing to pay a fixed-subscription premium. Competitive equilibria Â· Internet pricing Â· Subscription pricing Â· Price wars. ...|$|E
40|$|Media {{industries}} are important drivers of popular culture. A large fraction of leisure time {{is devoted to}} radio, magazines, newspapers, the Internet, and television (the illustrative example henceforth). Most advertising expenditures are incurred for these media. They are also mainly supported by advertising revenue. Early work stressed possible market failures in program duplication and catering to the Lowest Common Denominator, indicating lack of cultural diversity and quality. The business model for most media industries is underscored by advertisers' demand to reach prospective customers. This business model {{has important implications for}} performance in the market since viewer sovereignty is indirect. Viewers are attracted by programming, though they dislike the ads it carries, and advertisers want viewers as potential consumers. The two sides are coordinated by broadcasters (or "platforms") that choose ad levels and program types, and advertising finances the programming. Competition for viewers of the demographics most desired by advertisers implies that programming choices will be biased towards the tastes of those with such demographics. The ability to use subscription pricing may help improve performance by catering to the tastes of those otherwise under-represented, though higher full prices tend to favor broadcasters at the expense of viewers and advertisers. If advertising demand is weak, program equilibrium program selection may be too extreme as broadcasters strive to avoid <b>ruinous</b> subscription <b>price</b> competition, but strong advertising demand may lead to strong competition for viewers and hence minimum differentiation ("la pensee unique"). Markets (such as newspapers) with a high proportion of ad-lovers may be served only by monopoly due to a circulation spiral: advertisers want to place ads in the paper with most readers, but readers want to buy the paper with more ads. ...|$|R
40|$|Product {{differentiation}} {{is pervasive}} in markets. It {{is at the}} heart of structural empiricism and it smoothes jagged behavior that causes paradoxical outcomes in several theoretical models. Firms differentiate their products to avoid <b>ruinous</b> <b>price</b> competition. Representative consumer, discrete choice, and location models are not necessarily inconsistent, but performance depends crucially on the degree of localization of competition. With (symmetric) global competition, rents are typically small and market variety near optimal. With local competition, profits may be protected because entrants must find profitable niches. These rents lead firms to competitively dissipative them, and performance may be poor. 1. Overview Consumer goods are available in a variety of styles and brands. Product differentiation refers to such variations within a product class that (some) consumers view as imperfect substitutes.
