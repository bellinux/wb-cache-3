However, under the new NHTSA testing methodology introduced in 2010, the 2011 model year XV40 was downgraded to a three-star rating. This overall vehicle score was broken down into the frontal barrier crash rating of four-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), giving an overall front-impact protection rating of three-stars. A side barrier rating of five-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), gave for an overall side-impact protection rating of three-stars. The third testing component, the rollover rating, resulted in a grading of four-stars. Subsequently, the NHTSA tested a later release of the 2011 model year Camry with enhanced safety. This resulted in an increase to the side barrier rating from two- to four-stars for the front female passenger, thus increasing the Camry's overall score to four-stars.|$|E

40|$|Roof bolting is {{the most}} popular method for {{underground}} openings in the mining industry, especially in the bedded deposits such as coal. In fact, all U. S. underground coal mine entries are roof-bolted as required by law. However, roof falls still occur frequently in the roof bolted entries. The two possible reasons are: the lack of knowledge of and technology to detect the roof geological conditions in advance of mining, and lack of roof bolting design criteria for modern roof bolting systems. This research is to develop a method for predicting the roof geology and stability condition in real time during roof bolting operation. Based on this information, roof bolting design criteria for modern roof bolting systems will be developed for implementation in real time. For the prediction of roof geology and stability condition in real time, a micro processor was used and a program developed to monitor and record the drilling parameters of roof bolter. These parameters include feed pressure, feed flow (penetration rate), rotation pressure, rotation rate, vacuum pressure, oil temperature of hydraulic circuit, and signals for controlling machine. From the results of a series of laboratory and underground tests so far, feed pressure is found to be a good indicator for identifying the voids/fractures and estimating the <b>roof</b> rock <b>strength.</b> The method for determining quantitatively the location and the size of void/fracture and estimating the <b>roof</b> rock <b>strength</b> from the drilling parameters of roof bolter was developed. Also, a set of computational rules has been developed for in-mine roof using measured roof drilling parameters and implemented in MRGIS (Mine Roof Geology Information System), a software package developed to allow mine engineers {{to make use of the}} large amount of roof drilling parameters for predicting roof geology properties automatically. For the development of roof bolting criteria, finite element models were developed for tensioned and fully grouted bolting designs. Numerical simulations were performed to investigate the mechanisms of modern roof bolting systems including both the tension and fully grouted bolts. Parameters to be studied are: bolt length, bolt spacing, bolt size/strength, grout annulus, in-situ stress condition, overburden depth, and roof geology (massive strata, fractured, and laminated or thinly-bedded). Based on the analysis of the mechanisms of both bolting systems and failure modes of the bolted strata, roof bolting design criteria and programs for modern roof bolting systems were developed.

30|$|Coal bursts {{involve the}} sudden, violent {{ejection}} of coal or rock into the mine workings. They are a particular hazard because they typically occur without warning. During the past 2  years three US coal miners {{were killed in}} two coal bursts, following a 6 -year period during which there were zero burst fatalities. This paper puts the US experience {{in the context of}} worldwide research into coal bursts. It focuses on two major longwall mining coalfields which have struggled with bursts for decades. The Utah experience displays many of the “classic” burst characteristics, including deep cover, strong roof and floor rock, and a direct association between bursts and mining activity. In Colorado, the longwalls of the North Fork Valley (NFV) also work at great depth, but their <b>roof</b> and floor <b>strengths</b> are moderate, and most bursts have occurred during entry development or in headgates, bleeders, or other outby locations. The NFV bursts also {{are more likely to be}} associated with geologic structures and large magnitude seismic events. The paper provides a detailed case history to illustrate the experience in each of these coalfields. The paper closes with a brief discussion of how US longwalls have managed the burst risk.|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{certification}} for {{the installation}} of solar photovoltaic modules on wood roofs is often denied because existing wood roofs do not meet current building codes. Rather than requiring expensive structural retrofits, we desire to show that many roofs are actually sufficiently strong if the effect of composite action produced by joist-sheathing interaction is considered. In a series of laboratory experiments using {{a limited number of}} two-by-four wood joists with and without sheathing panels, conventionally sheathed stud-grade joists, surprisingly, exhibited between 18 % and 63 % higher nominal strength than similar bare joists. To explain this strength increase, a simple model was developed to predict the strengths of the nailed partially composite sections, but the model only justifies a 1. 4 % to 3. 8 % increase in bending strength of joists with an allowable bending strength of 1000 [*]psi. More testing is indicated to resolve this discrepancy between laboratory results and analytical modeling results. In addition to elucidating nonlinear partial composite behavior of existing roof systems, this paper shows that, with minor changes in <b>roof</b> framing practices, <b>strength</b> increases of 70 % or more are achievable, compared to the strengths of conventionally sheathed joists...|$|R

40|$|In {{study of}} the {{behaviour}} of roof strata in underground coal mines the <b>strength</b> of the <b>roof</b> rock, particularly, the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) plays a significant role. Application of simple tools in assessment of the rock strength has been practiced by many researchers one of which being Schmidt hammer. Due to its portability, easiness in use, rapidity, low cost and its non-destructive procedure of application, it {{is among the most}} popular tools in this respect. Application of this tool in prediction of the <b>roof</b> rock <b>strength,</b> in a new context, is the aim of this research work. A comprehensive review of the literature revealed that most of the empirical equations introduced for determination of the unconfined compressive strength of rocks based on the Schmidt hammer rebound number (Rn) are not practically reliable enough as in most of the cases one formula is used for all types of rocks, although the density of rocks is introduced to the formulas in some of these cases. On the other hand, if one specific relationship between hammer rebound number and unconfined compressive strength is introduced for one type of rock, the equation will yield a much higher coefficient of correlation. During a research program supported by The Shahrood University of Technology, Iran, a third type of approach was considered. The study aimed to express the relationship between Schmidt rebound number and unconfined compressive strength of rock mass under a particular geological circumstances. As an example, in this study, the situation selected was the immediate roof rock of coal seams at Tazareh Colliery, Shahrood, Iran. In order to determine the Schmidt number and the unconfined compressive strength, a significant number of samples were selected and tested both in-situ and in the laboratory and a new relationship was introduced. The equation can be used to predict UCS of the roof rock in coal extracting areas at this colliery by performing simple in-situ Schmidt hammer tests...|$|R
40|$|Tailgate {{stability}} within longwall {{coal mining}} {{is critical to}} longwall productivity and safety of mine personnel. A mechanistic model was developed and tested to explain observed high deformation tailgate behaviour characterised by lateral strata movement. Field investigations were conducted at three Australian longwall mines {{with an emphasis on}} the measurement of; horizontal strata movement about gateroads during longwall extraction, and the load/deformation characteristics of standing supports. 3 D numerical modelling was used to simulate tailgate deformation, and interaction of various support types and design strategies. The sensitivity of strata and support behaviour to; variations in <b>roof</b> geology, <b>strength</b> of sliding interfaces, depth of cover, pre-mining horizontal stress magnitude and orientation, and strength and stiffness characteristics of standing supports was modelled. Laboratory investigations of a standing support product, the &# 145;Can&# 146;, at reduced scale (one third) were conducted. The tests determined the loading mechanics of the product and provided a basis for optimisation of the engineering properties (strength and stiffness). Horizontal strata movement about longwall extraction was found to {{have a significant impact on}} strata behaviour at two of the three mines investigated. The term &# 145;skew roof&# 146; was coined to describe the deformation process. Essentially the roof strata was found to &# 145;skew&# 146; towards the approaching goaf. The key geotechnical factors found to control the skew roof mechanism were; magnitude and orientation of the pre-mining horizontal stress, presence of weak interfaces along which sliding could occur, and shear strength of the interfaces. Measurement of the nature and extent of skew roof deformation specific to each mine provided a sound engineering basis for support design. These included; the relative roles of long tendons versus standing support, optimal pattern (position across and along the roadway) of standing supports, and appropriate strength and stiffness characteristics. The findings were successfully implemented at Metropolitan Colliery in particular, where adequate tailgate serviceability has been achieved within a high deformation environment, and whilst maintaining a relatively small chain pillar width. The research has achieved an alternative to empirical and trial and error tailgate support design methods...|$|R
