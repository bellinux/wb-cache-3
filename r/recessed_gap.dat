40|$|Electron {{paramagnetic}} resonance (EPR) spectroscopy can {{be applied}} to directly measure free radicals; however, it has not been possible to measure important biologic radicals in situ because conventional spectrometer designs are not suitable for the performance of measurements on large aqueous structures such as whole organs or tissues. We describe the design, construction, and application of instrumentation developed in an effort to obtain optimum performance in measuring free radicals in intact biologic organs or tissues. This spectrometer consists of a 1 - to 2 -GHz microwave bridge with the source locked to the resonant frequency of a specially designed <b>recessed</b> <b>gap,</b> loop-gap resonator. The principles of resonator design and construction are analyzed and described. Using this spectrometer radical concentrations as low as 0. 4 microM in aqueous solutions could be measured. Studies of isolated beating hearts involving simultaneous real time measurements of free radicals and cardiac contractile function are performed. This in vivo EPR technique is applied to study the kinetics of free radical uptake and metabolism in normally perfused and globally ischemic hearts. In addition, it is demonstrated that this technique can be used to noninvasively measure tissue oxygen consumption. Thus, low frequency EPR spectroscopy offers great promise in the study of in vivo free radical generation and the effects of this radical generation on whole biologic tissues...|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{producing}} a chip package includes providing a substrate comprising a first recess having a recess bottom and recess side walls. A chip comprising a chip backside is introduced into the recess such that the chip does not protrude from the recess and such that a gap remains between the recess side walls and the chip, the chip backside being attached to the <b>recess</b> bottom. The <b>gap</b> is filled with a filler material...|$|R
40|$|Method {{of forming}} a {{metallic}} structure (2) in a micro-machined recess that {{is provided in}} a surface of a semiconductor substrate (8). The method comprises positioning a protrusion (10) of an apparatus for depositing the metallic structure at least partly inside the recess, thus partly occupying the recess with the protrusion and defining in the <b>recess</b> a <b>gap</b> (14) along the protrusion. The method comprises driving a deposition fluid (20) through the <b>gap</b> in the <b>recess</b> along the protrusion. The method comprises growing in the gap the metallic structure by depositing metal ions contained by the deposition fluid. The method comprises moving the protrusion and the substrate relative to each other so that the protrusion, while being positioned in the recess, moves relative to the recess in a direction out of the recess, thus giving way for the growing of the metallic structure, and forming the metallic structure in the recess...|$|R
