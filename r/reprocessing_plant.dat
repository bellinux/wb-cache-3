5|$|Nuclear waste {{policy in}} Germany is in flux. German {{planning}} for a permanent geologic repository began in 1974, focused on salt dome Gorleben, a salt mine near Gorleben about 100 kilometers northeast of Braunschweig. The site was announced in 1977 with plans for a <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plant,</b> spent fuel management, and permanent disposal facilities at a single site. Plans for the <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plant</b> were dropped in 1979. In 2000, {{the federal government and}} utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years, and the government committed to ending its use of nuclear power, closing one reactor in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In Sweden, as of 2007 {{there are}} ten {{operating}} nuclear reactors that produce about 45% of its electricity. Two other reactors in Barsebäck {{were shut down}} in 1999 and 2005. When these reactors were built, it was expected their nuclear fuel would be reprocessed in a foreign country, and the reprocessing waste would not be returned to Sweden. Later, construction of a domestic <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plant</b> was contemplated, but has not been built.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain has 19 {{operating}} reactors, producing about 20% of its electricity. It processes {{much of its}} {{spent fuel}} at Sellafield on the northwest coast across from Ireland, where nuclear waste is vitrified and sealed in stainless steel canisters for dry storage above ground for at least 50 years before eventual deep geologic disposal. Sellafield {{has a history of}} environmental and safety problems, including a fire in a nuclear plant in Windscale, and a significant incident in 2005 at the main <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plant</b> (THORP).|$|E
40|$|Reduction of {{radioactive}} waste volume {{is one of}} the important issues for spent fuel <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants.</b> JGC has intensively developed radioactive waste processing technologies aiming at waste volume reduction and at immobilization with environmentally low impact for Purex type <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants.</b> These technologies are Electrolyti...|$|R

50|$|The former plant {{remains the}} only privately owned nuclear fuel {{reprocessing}} center to have ever operated in the United States. Two additional private nuclear fuel <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> were constructed (one by General Electric in Morris, Illinois, and another by Allied General Nuclear Services in Barnwell, South Carolina), but were never permitted to operate. Other <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> in the United States have been operated by the U.S. Department of Energy rather than private companies.|$|R
5|$|In 1982 the Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Management Executive (NIREX) was {{established}} {{with responsibility for}} disposing of long-lived nuclear waste and in 2006 a Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) of the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs recommended geologic disposal 200–1,000 meters underground. NIREX developed a generic repository concept based on the Swedish model but has not yet selected a site. A Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is responsible for packaging waste from reprocessing and will eventually relieve British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. of responsibility for power reactors and the Sellafield <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{plans to build}} a nuclear fuel <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plant</b> in the Bavarian town of Wackersdorf lead to major protests. In 1986, West German police were confronted by demonstrators armed with slingshots, {{crowbars}} and Molotov cocktails at the site of a nuclear <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plant</b> in Wackersdorf. The plans for the plant were abandoned in 1988. It still isn't clear whether protests or plant economics led to the decision.|$|E
25|$|A Thermal Oxide <b>Reprocessing</b> <b>Plant</b> (THORP) {{was opened}} at Sellafield in 1994. Construction {{had begun in}} the 1970s and cost £2.4 billion.|$|E
40|$|Minor {{actinides}} {{have received}} considerable attention {{recently in the}} nuclear power industry. Because of their potential value as recycle fuels in thermal and breeder reactors, <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> may have an economic incentive to extract Np, Am, and Cm from their waste streams. This report discusses the technique of hybrid densitometry and its potential to measure Np and Am in <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants.</b> Precision estimates are made for the hybrid analysis of Np and Am in two types of dissolver solutions...|$|R
5000|$|Currently, {{there are}} eleven <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> in the world. Of these, two are {{large-scale}} commercially operated <b>plants</b> for the <b>reprocessing</b> of spent fuel elements from light water reactors with throughputs {{of more than}} [...] of uranium per year. These are La Hague, France with a capacity of [...] per year and Sellafield, England at [...] uranium per year. The rest are small experimental plants. The two large-scale commercial <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> together can <b>reprocess</b> 2,800 tonnes of uranium waste annually.|$|R

25|$|March 1997: The Tokaimura nuclear <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plant</b> {{fire and}} explosion, {{northeast}} of Tokyo. 37 workers {{were exposed to}} low doses of radiation. Donen later acknowledged it had initially suppressed information about the fire.|$|E
25|$|On 19 April 2005 83,000 litres of {{radioactive}} waste was discovered to have leaked in the Thorp <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plant</b> from a cracked pipe {{into a huge}} stainless steel-lined concrete sump chamber built to contain leaks.|$|E
25|$|Drop-off centers {{require the}} waste {{producer}} {{to carry the}} recyclates to a central location, either an installed or mobile collection station or the <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plant</b> itself. They are the easiest type of collection to establish but suffer from low and unpredictable throughput.|$|E
50|$|The {{atmospheric}} concentration of krypton-85 around the North Pole is about 30 {{percent higher than}} that at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station because {{nearly all of the}} world's nuclear reactors and all of its major nuclear <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> are located in the northern hemisphere, and also well-north of the equator.To be more specific, those nuclear <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> with significant capacities are located in the United States, the United Kingdom, the French Republic, the Russian Federation, Mainland China (PRC), Japan, India, and Pakistan.|$|R
50|$|It {{is known}} that the isotope {{responsible}} {{for the majority of}} the gamma exposure in fuel <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> (and the Chernobyl site in 2005) is Cs-137. Iodine-129 is one of the major radioactive elements released from <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants.</b> In nuclear reactors both Cs-137 and strontium-90 are found in locations remote from the fuel. This is because these isotopes are formed by the beta decay of noble gases (xenon-137 {halflife of 3.8 minutes} and krypton-90 {halflife 32 seconds}) which enable these isotopes to be deposited in locations remote from the fuel (e.g. on control rods).|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1994, the {{operators}} announced agreements with the nuclear <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> at La Hague, France and Sellafield, England, and with that opted for long-term interim storage.|$|R
25|$|However, {{because no}} {{complete}} molten salt <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plant</b> has been built, all testing {{has been limited}} to the laboratory, and {{with only a few}} elements. There is still more research and development needed to improve separation and make reprocessing more economically viable.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plant</b> {{was built to}} extract the plutonium from spent fuel to provide fissile material for the UK's atomic weapons programme, and for exchange with the United States through the US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement. It operated from 1951 until 1964, with an annual capacity of 300 tonnes (295 L/T) of fuel, or 750 tonnes (738 L/T) of low burn-up fuel. It was first used to reprocess fuel from the Windscale Piles, and was later repurposed to process fuel from UK Magnox reactors, however following the commissioning of the dedicated Magnox <b>Reprocessing</b> <b>Plant,</b> it was itself recycled to become a pre-handling plant to allow oxide fuel to be reprocessed in the Magnox plant, and was closed in 1973.|$|E
25|$|DPRK {{agreed to}} disable all nuclear {{facilities}} subject to September 2005 Joint Statement and February 13 Agreement, including the disablement of three facilities at Yongbyan by 31 December 2007: the 5 MW Experimental Reactor, the <b>Reprocessing</b> <b>Plant,</b> and the Nuclear Fuel Rod Fabrication Facility.|$|E
40|$|The depth {{profiles}} of the I- 129 concentration and the I- 129 /I- 127 ratio in a surface sediment core from the Kattegat area have been analyzed {{in order to obtain}} information about the different sources of I- 129 in that core. Therefore, a mathematical model that relates the measured values to the available emission data from the nuclear fuel <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> and nuclear weapons tests has been applied. Results show that the <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> at La Hague and Sellafield are the main sources of I- 129 in the sediment. Results about the transfer from the release points at the <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> to the sampling zone agree with other literature data. The model calculates quite fast the sedimentation of I- 129 in the sampling place, probably attached to organic matter. Finally, an estimation of approximately 89 kg of I- 129 released by Sellafield between 1952 and 1968 has been obtained from the model...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{issues of}} {{materials}} development and corrosion performance of various components, coating technology and corrosion monitoring for nuclear fuel <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> is presented. Development of special stainless steels, Ti and zircaloy based alloys, double oxide coating for electrolytic dissolver, dissimilar joints, noble metal coating, thermal barrier coatings, nanostructured Ti, TiO 2 and nitride coatings, amorphous metallic glass coatings, etc. for highly corrosive nitric acid environments are discussed. The results of dynamic nitric acid loop of type 304 L SS and zircaloy- 4 used for long term corrosion assessment of materials employed in <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> are also addressed...|$|R

25|$|On 19 April 2005, leaked {{radioactive}} waste was discovered from ThORP (Thermal Oxide <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plant)</b> {{through a crack}} into a sump chamber which may have started as early as August 2004, and was categorised as a level 3 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale, resulting in fines.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{power in}} the United Kingdom generates around {{a quarter of the}} country's {{electricity}} as of 2016, projected to rise to a third by 2035. The UK has 15 operational nuclear reactors at seven plants (14 advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGR) and one pressurised water reactor (PWR)), as well as a nuclear <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plant</b> at Sellafield.|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} {{variability of}} 129 I in atmospheric samples taken between 1993 and 1999 in Seville (Spain) has been studied. Results show a good {{agreement with the}} history of the 129 I gaseous emissions of the <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> at Sellafield and La Hague. This suggests that these emissions are the origin of the 129 I present in the atmosphere in southern Spain. Apart from this, the similarity between the time evolution of gaseous 129 I and 129 I/ 127 I in 1998 would imply a fast chemical equilibration between 129 I from the <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> and stable iodine...|$|R
40|$|The {{contamination}} of the environment in the Federal Republic of Germany due to radioactive iodine released from nuclear power stations and <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> for the next century will be considered. Based on present iodine emission rates the results indicate an upper limit of the installed power for light water reactors at one location. In contrary to the light water reactors high temperature reactors,and liquid metal fast breeders emits iodine in small quantities, only. Near nuclear power reactors iodine- 131 contributes about 80 % and near <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> iodine- 129 contributes about 80 % to the thyroid dose. In the next century no limitations in building new nuclear power <b>plants</b> and <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants</b> are to be expected with regard to local aspects of radioactive iodine. The radiation dose of globallydistributet iodine should be several orders of magnitude lower than the maximum dose near nuclear facilities. This investigation was done in co-operation with the Institut fuer Reaktorentwicklung of the Kernforschungsanlage Juelich and the Lehrstuhl für Reaktortechnik of the- Technische Hochschule Aachen and was sponsored by the Federal Ministry of the Interior...|$|R

40|$|Authority (UKAEA) site at Dounreay in {{northern}} Scotland {{would no longer}} be seeking further commercial reprocessing contracts. This decision laid down the foundations for the UKAEA to focus firmly on the task of decommissioning the UKAEA’s site at Dounreay. Fifty to sixty years has been identified as the period in which to decommission the site and restore its environment. The business of decommissioning at Dounreay presents a number of interesting challenges that need to be addressed. There are a number of complex and unique projects that must be undertaken including the decommissioning of the early fast reactors, a materials test reactor, metallurgical laboratories (housing fume cupboards, glove boxes and shielded cells) and novel fuel <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants.</b> This paper discusses the experience gained during the various stages of decommissioning in the fast reactors and nuclear fuel cycle <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants,</b> focusing on the Dounreay Fast Reactor, the Prototype Fast Reactor, a criticality test facility, fuel <b>reprocessing</b> <b>plants,</b> laboratories and associated environment. The UKAEA at Dounreay is dedicated to restoring the environment both safely and cost effectively. This paper discusses the practical radiation protection issues that have been encountered during the early stages of a number of decommissioning projects on the site. The conference presentation will give an update on our experience and discuss lessons learnt...|$|R
