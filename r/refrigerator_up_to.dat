40|$|Increasing egg storage {{duration}} affects egg internal quality, especially albumen quality by increasing pH and decreasing Haugh Unit (HU). But, {{in most of}} African contexts, egg producers, sellers and consumers store the eggs in different conditions regardless of quality deterioration. In this study, 1920 eggs produced by Lohmann layer flocks of 48 weeks and 58 weeks of age were investigated. The eggs were divided randomly and equally in 4 groups and stored at 3 different conditions for 21 days at: 1) Room Conditions (RoC); 2) Super Market Conditions (SmC) and 3) Refrigerator Conditions (RfC). During storage, all the eggs were weighed and Resonant Frequency (RF) were measured at day 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 according to flock age and storage condition. Then at the same days, sample of 30 eggs per flock and per storage condition were used to measure albumen pH and HU. The results indicate that eggs weight decreased significantly with {{storage duration}} (P< 0. 001). But, egg relative weight loss was lower (P< 0. 01) for eggs of RfC group than that of SmC and RoC groups. There was a positive linear relationship between RF and storage duration. But, daily increase in RF was affected by layer flock age. The highest daily increase was obtained in RoC group or SmC group, respectively for flock of 48 weeks of age or flock of 58 weeks of age. Eggs of RfC groups had the highest albumen HU and the lowest albumen pH (P< 0. 001).

Once the environment is split into three;a hot, cold and work reservoirs a heat engine can operate.

The quantum tricycle, a device connected by three external leads to three heat reservoirs is used as a template for engines and refrigerators. The equation of motion for the heat currents and power can be derived from first principle. Only a global description of the coupling of the device to the reservoirs is consistent with the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Optimisation of the devices leads to a balanced set of parameters where the couplings to the three reservoirs are of the same order and the external driving field is in resonance. When analysing refrigerators special attention is devoted to a dynamical version of the third law of thermodynamics.

40|$|The {{domestic}} refrigerator {{is responsible for}} 30 % of the average household electricity consumption in Brazil, and the power costs regarding a single <b>refrigerator</b> represents <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5 % of the Brazilian minimum wage. The capacity control method employed {{in most of these}} systems consists of a thermostat used to turn on and off the compressor to maintain the temperature between the desired levels. This method of capacity control is responsible for efficiency losses {{as a result of the}} start-up and shut-down transients. The duration and the number of on/off cycles influence directly the temperature profile inside the refrigerator and the system energetic efficiency. By adjusting the thermostat, the maximum and minimum temperature achieved during the system operation are changed, and also the range between them. Having all that in mind, the aim of this study is to optimize the temperature range in a {{domestic refrigerator}} in order to make power consumption as low as possible while maintaining a given maximum temperature that cannot be exceeded in order to keep the food properly preserved. The refrigerator was modeled as a first order plus time delay system. A hysteretic relay test was used to estimate the system parameters.

Preliminary results indicated that, for the refrigerator studied in this work, the optimal amplitude should be set at approximately 7 Â°C, when the refrigerator is half loaded.

The basic ingredients of rendang are beef meat, coconut milk, and spices. The process of cooking  R endang took around  5   to  6  hours at the temperature around 80 - 9 3 o C. There are  2  types of food will be produced during the cooking processes differentiated by water content and colors. They are as following:  K alio (cooked until the sauce was thick brown color)  and Rendang  (cooked until the sauce was thick and dry and dark brown color). Rendang if cooked properly still good to consume until 3 weeks at room temperature, even last month stored in the <b>refrigerator</b> and <b>up</b> <b>to</b> six months in frozen.  As the food is cooked in a relatively longer period of time and with various  spices  it is interesting to know the nutritional value of the food. This paper is presenting a preliminary result of the research which aims to evaluate the nutritional value of  R endang by analyzing the chemi cal characteristic of lipid and fatty acid profile of Rendang. Rendang and kalio as a food  will have  3 part such as a the meat, sauce, and oil (fat and oil). This paper will discuss just for the fat and oil of Rendang. T he result show ed  that the  chemical characteristic of fat and oil of Rendang relative stable (not change) compare to Kalio where the fat and oil in Kalio and Rendang around 99, 24 % - 99, 46 %, peroxide value not detected, Free fatty acid (FFA) number 0, 21 - 0, 28 %, Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test 0, 56 - 0, 70 TBA/kg fat and oil, and the Trans fatty acid (TFA) not detected. The profile of fatty acid showed that the fatty acid of kalio and rendang are dominated by the saturated fatty acid short chain and medium chain (SCFA and MCFA) around 59, 48 - 59. 91 %, long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) around 31, 41 - 31. 47 % and the rest are unsaturated fatty acid around 9. 10 - 8, 61 %. From chemical characterization of fat and oil, we can take a conclusion that Kalio and Rendang good to consume. </span...|$|R
