5|$|The muscle of the {{esophagus}} in many mammals is striated initially, but then becomes smooth muscle in the caudal third or so.

5|$|While {{the number}} and {{severity}} of symptoms varies among individuals, repetitive <b>regurgitation</b> of undigested food (known as rumination) {{after the start of}} a meal is always present. In some individuals, the <b>regurgitation</b> is small, occurring {{over a long period of}} time following ingestion, and can be rechewed and swallowed. In others, the amount can be bilious and short lasting, and must be expelled.|$|E
5|$|Rumination syndrome, or Merycism, is an under-diagnosed chronic {{motility}} disorder {{characterized by}} effortless <b>regurgitation</b> of most meals following consumption, {{due to the}} involuntary contraction of the muscles around the abdomen. There is no retching, nausea, heartburn, odour, or abdominal pain associated with the <b>regurgitation,</b> as there is with typical vomiting. The disorder has been historically documented as affecting only infants, young children, and people with cognitive disabilities (the prevalence {{is as high as}} 10% in institutionalized patients with various mental disabilities).|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundFenfluramine and its {{derivatives}} {{have been}} associated with significant risk of developing valvular heart disease but its exact prevalence and severity are still debated. AimTo evaluate the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of patients hospitalized in a cardiology centre and who had past exposure to these drugs. MethodsBetween July 2011 and February 2012, patients admitted to the hospitalization and intensive care units at the University Centre of Montpellier, France were questioned about past exposure to fenfluramine or its derivatives. In patients who reported exposure, a questionnaire assessing prescribing patterns and medical history was proposed and echocardiography performed. All of the usual echocardiographic variables were analysed. We applied criteria from a French multicentre registry for diagnosis of drug-induced valvulopathy: leaflets and subvalvular apparatus thickening and retraction, leaflets loss of coaptation, no calcification, and no stenosis. ResultsNinety-five patients exposed to these drugs were included. The majority were female (n= 62, 65. 3 %), 53. 2 % (n= 50) had diabetes and 90. 5 % (n= 86) were exposed to benfluorex. Mean treatment duration was 52. 3 months (95 % confidence interval [CI] 39. 0 – 65. 6). Valvular <b>regurgitations</b> were observed in 64. 0 % of patients (n= 57) while 19. 8 % (n= 17) had pulmonary hypertension. Highly probable fenfluramine-induced <b>regurgitations</b> were present in 18. 6 % (n= 16) of patients, possibly fenfluramine-induced <b>regurgitations</b> in 38. 2 % (n= 34) of patients, and unlikely fenfluramine-induced <b>regurgitations</b> in 25. 8 % (n= 23) of patients. Highly probable fenfluramine-induced <b>regurgitations</b> were mild to moderate in severity in all except three patients. ConclusionConsidering the frequency of probable or possible fenfluramine-induced <b>regurgitations</b> {{and in the absence of}} definite knowledge about the evolution of drug-induced valvular disease, systematic questioning about fenfluramine use may be advisable in hospitalized cardiac patients...|$|R
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal manometry and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis. Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome. The primary symptom, the <b>regurgitation</b> of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least sixweeks of the past twelve months. The <b>regurgitation</b> must begin within 30minutes of {{the completion of a}} meal. Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90minutes, or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.|$|E
5|$|Treatment is {{different}} for infants and the mentally handicapped than {{for adults and}} adolescents of normal intelligence. For adults and adolescents, and relaxation techniques, to be practice after eating or whenever <b>regurgitation</b> occurs, {{has proven to be}} most effective.|$|E
5|$|Unlike typical vomiting, the <b>regurgitation</b> is {{typically}} described as effortless and unforced. There is seldom nausea preceding the expulsion, and the undigested food lacks the bitter taste and odour of stomach acid and bile.|$|E
40|$|<b>Regurgitations</b> from {{nestling}} Grey Herons Ardea cinerea at Loch Leven, Scotland, April-July 1981 – 83, contained mainly {{three types}} of prey:perch, brown trout and ducklings. The diet varied markedly through the season but not between years. As the heron breeding season progressed, perch occurred in fewer <b>regurgitations</b> and ducklings in more. There was no seasonal variation in the occurrence of brown trout. Regular collections of duckling down from the heronry suggested that the consumption of ducklings peaked in early June. The ducklings taken by herons were less than 10 days old, Mallard ducklings predominating before mid June and Tufted ducklings later. Most ducklings were taken by only a few herons:those that bred earliest and which initially fed their young on perch. Ducklings became {{a major part of}} their diet in the late nestling period and broods fed on ducklings fledged no more or fewer young than others. Herons feeding their young on brown trout took ducklings rarely, if ever. It is argued that variation in the contents of <b>regurgitations</b> resulted from three interacting variables; the type of feeding habitat used by individual Grey Herons, the date at which they bred and the date that <b>regurgitations</b> were produced by their nestlings. The numbers of ducklings taken by herons were calculated to be about 230 in 1981 and 291 in 1982, about 5...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Patients with {{repaired}} Tetralogy of Fallot commonly {{suffer from}} chronic pulmonary valve <b>regurgitations</b> and extremely dilated right ventricle (RV).

This study aims at quantifying the regional impacts of growth and <b>regurgitations</b> upon the end-diastolic RV anatomy. The ultimate goal is to determine, among clinical variables, predictors for the shape in order to build a statistical model that predicts RV remodelling. The proposed approach relies on a forward model based on currents and LDDMM algorithm to estimate an unbiased template of 18 patients and the deformations towards each individual shape. Cross-sectional multivariate analyses are carried out to assess the effects of body surface area, tricuspid and transpulmonary valve <b>regurgitations</b> upon the RV shape. The statistically significant deformation modes were found clinically relevant. Canonical correlation analysis yielded a generative model that was successfully tested on two new patients. ...|$|R

5|$|Although {{it offers}} the {{greatest}} degree of protection against <b>regurgitation</b> and pulmonary aspiration, tracheal intubation {{is not the only}} means to maintain a patent airway.

5|$|Gastroparesis {{is another}} common misdiagnosis. Like {{rumination}} syndrome, patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion of a meal. Unlike rumination, gastroparesis causes vomiting (in contrast to <b>regurgitation)</b> of food, {{which is not}} being digested further, from the stomach. This vomiting occurs several hours after a meal is ingested, preceded by nausea and retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit.|$|E
5|$|In {{adults and}} adolescents, {{hypothesized}} causes generally fall {{into one of}} either category: habit-induced, and trauma-induced. Habit-induced individuals generally have a history of bulimia nervosa or of intentional <b>regurgitation</b> (magicians and professional regurgitators, for example), which though initially self-induced, forms a subconscious habit that can continue to manifest itself outside the control of the affected individual. Trauma-induced individuals describe an emotional or physical injury (such as recent surgery, psychological distress, concussions, deaths in the family, etc.), which preceded the onset of rumination, often by several months.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} {{involving}} 700 echocardiographic examinations (echoes) was to evaluate the diagnostic impact of the method for right heart abnormalities. Among 200 two-dimensional echoes of a first series we found 23 abnormalities (11. 5 %) : nine congenital malformations, seven pulmonary hypertensions, four cases of isolated right ventricular dilatation, two tricuspid <b>regurgitations</b> (TR), one right atrial myxoma. In four cases the abnormality was clinically unexpected. In a second series of 500 patients, consecutively subjected to a two-dimensional echo with pulsed-wave and continuous-wave Doppler, we found 119 <b>regurgitations</b> of right heart valves in 98 patients (20 %) : 35 TR and 24 pulmonary <b>regurgitations</b> (PR) secondary to pulmonary hypertension, 13 TR secondary to tricuspid valve prolapse, 16 TR and 11 PR as a part of polyvalvular disease; 10 TR and 10 PR were isolated observations. The examination technique and the echo signs of the principal abnormalities of the right heart are reviewed. In summary, we emphasize that right heart abnormalities are surprisingly frequent in routine echo investigations; therefore, complete study of all the right heart structures in every echo examination is mandatory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is {{a severe}} {{congenital}} heart disease that mainly affects the right ventricle (RV). It requires surgical repair early in infancy. Chronic <b>regurgitations</b> may appear due to damaged pulmonary valves, resulting in extreme RV dilation. To reduce risk factors late after repair, new pulmonary valves must be re-implanted. However, establishing the best timing for re-intervention is a clinical challenge {{because of the large}} variability in RV shape and in pathology evolution.

5|$|In adults, the {{diagnosis}} {{is supported by the}} absence of classical or structural diseases of the gastrointestinal system. Supportive criteria include a regurgitant that does not taste sour or acidic, is generally odourless, is effortless, or at most preceded by a belching sensation, that there is no retching preceding the <b>regurgitation,</b> and that the act is not associated with nausea or heartburn.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{indication}} for tracheal intubation is for the placement of a conduit through which nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics may be administered. General anesthetic agents, opioids, and neuromuscular-blocking drugs may diminish or even abolish the respiratory drive. Although {{it is not the}} only means to maintain a patent airway during general anesthesia, intubation of the trachea provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against <b>regurgitation</b> and pulmonary aspiration.|$|E
5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} <b>regurgitation</b> {{to ward off}} predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened.

This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E

Pellets are easy to collect and are useful to detect gross changes in diet of full-grown, but possibly non-breeding, Shags between years or colonies. Otoliths recovered from pellets cannot be used for age determination or back-calculations of size of sandeels eaten by Shags. <b>Regurgitations</b> can be used to describe the diet of chicks.

40|$|In {{myrmecophilous}} Lepidoptera, mostly lycaenids and riodinids, caterpillars trick ants into transporting {{them to the}} ant nest {{where they}} feed on the brood or, in the more derived "cuckoo strategy", trigger <b>regurgitations</b> (trophallaxis) from the ants and obtain trophic eggs. We show {{for the first time}} that the caterpillars of a moth (Eublemma albifascia; Noctuidae; Acontiinae) also use this strategy to obtain <b>regurgitations</b> and trophic eggs from ants (Oecophylla longinoda). Females short-circuit the adoption process by laying eggs directly on the ant nests, and workers carry just-hatched caterpillars inside. Parasitized colonies sheltered 44 to 359 caterpillars, each receiving more trophallaxis and trophic eggs than control queens. The thus-starved queens lose weight, stop laying eggs (which transport the pheromones that induce infertility in the workers) and die. Consequently, the workers lay male-destined eggs before and after the queen's death, allowing the colony to invest its remaining resources in male production before it vanishes...|$|R
