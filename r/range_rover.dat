Scenes filmed in Austria centred on the Ice Q Restaurant, standing in for the fictional Hoffler Klinik, a private medical clinic in the Austrian Alps. Filming included an action scene featuring a Land Rover Defender Bigfoot and a <b>Range</b> <b>Rover</b> Sport. Various airplane models were used in filming, from a life-sized plane with detachable wings to film the crash in the woods, to plane fuselages either built atop snowmobiles or shot from nitrogen cannons. Production was temporarily halted first by an injury to Craig, who sprained his knee whilst shooting a fight scene, and later by an accident involving a filming vehicle that saw three crew members injured, {{at least one of them}} seriously.|$|E

5000|$|Callaway {{decided to}} use a four-pin front {{differential}} to accommodate the increased torque rather than the two-pin front diff used on standard production <b>Range</b> <b>Rovers.</b> After working with Callaway on the four pin front diff Land Rover decided {{to put them in}} all of the 1999 <b>Range</b> <b>Rovers</b> since the 4 wheel traction control that added ABS regulated traction control to the front axle in 1999 also put extra stress on the front diff (<b>Range</b> <b>Rovers</b> from 1993 to 1998 only had traction control on the rear axle). <> ...|$|R

To prepare for US launch, <b>Range</b> <b>Rover</b> of North America {{was established in}} Lanham, Maryland in late 1985, with plans to import Range Rovers through the ports of Baltimore and Long Beach, California, beginning in March 1987, to be sold nationwide through a network of 36 dealers, expanding to 65 by 1988.

The manual transmission was dropped entirely, leaving only the automatic transmission. The E38 7 Series electronics system were being phased out during {{the development of the}} third-generation <b>Range</b> <b>Rover,</b> and being replaced with the electronics from the BMW E39 5 Series. The entertainment system (Radio Function, Navigation System, Television and Telecommunications systems, as well as the automotive computer bus system) on pre-facelift models were almost identical to those in the BMW E39 5 Series. Early models of the third-generation model <b>Range</b> <b>Rover</b> could be upgraded with some newer BMW technologies, although from 2005 onwards the electronics were based on Ford/Jaguar systems.|$|E

The {{club was}} {{established}} in September 1997 through the enthusiasm of local boys and has steadily grown, now operating 25 teams ranging from the little hurricanes soccer school, Under 7s and adults, with over 250 players registered as club members from all over the island. The first letter with the <b>Range</b> <b>Rovers</b> name header to gain permission for use of the Range Road pitch was written on 15 September 1997. Permission was granted and <b>Range</b> <b>Rovers</b> FC was formed and affiliated to the Kent County Football Association on 28 September 1997. In November 1997 the club badge was designed and the Spitfire plane was incorporated to depict the fact that the site on Range Road was a RAF airfield during the Second World War. The first formal club meeting was held on 3 December 1997, during which the first committee was formed. The club gained the FA Charter Mark in February 2005, still the only football club on the Isle of Sheppey to do so. Also in March 2007 their U13s reached the Kent County Cup Final, a notable feat for a small village side. The club now play at three sites in Eastchurch; Range Road, Shurland Meadow and Dicksons Field. They also have pitches at Seager Road, Sheerness and Halfway Houses Primary School. The club continues to grow and season 2012-13 sees an academy (Little Hurricanes) and boys teams from Under 7s through to Under 18s and two men's teams. In 2010 the club ran its third annual tournament, an event which sees nearly 200 teams from all over the South East taking part. This is currently stopped due to major refurbishment work at the IOSA. The club now has the tenancy at Seager Road in Sheerness as its new home ground. Some of <b>Range</b> <b>Rovers</b> players have gone on to be very successful in their football careers.|$|R
