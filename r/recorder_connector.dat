50|$|The {{calculator}} had a BASIC interpreter, MEMO function, {{a formula}} library. The built-in 8 kB memory could be expanded using the optional Casio RP-8 (8 kB) or RP-33 (32 kB) RAM expansion modules. An optional Casio FA-6 interface board provided a cassette tape <b>recorder</b> <b>connector,</b> a Centronics printer connector and an RS-232C port. The calculator could print data and listings on any Centronics printer; printing graphics required the Casio FP-100 plotter-printer.|$|E
5000|$|Connectors, {{similar in}} purpose {{to the data}} buses inside a {{computer}} CPU, connect the markers to the peripheral equipment. each connector {{is made up of}} large relays of 30 contacts each, to connect all the leads by which the marker would exchange information and control signals. For example, each of the oblong reed packs in an OR would have to be connected by five leads through the originating register marker connector to transmit the two-out-of-five code representing one dialed digit. For speed, transfer is entirely parallel, requiring many large relays to connect so many wires. Connectors that respond to a peripheral circuit's request for action are given the name of the requesting circuit and [...] "marker", as in ORMC or IRMC. Connectors whose use was requested by a marker are named only for the circuit to which they connect, as in outsender connector, line link connector, and trouble <b>recorder</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|E
