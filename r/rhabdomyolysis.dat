5|$|Recurrent <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> {{may result}} from {{intrinsic}} muscle enzyme deficiencies, which are usually inherited and often appear during childhood. Many structural muscle diseases feature episodes of <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> that are triggered by exercise, general anesthesia {{or any of the}} other causes of <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> listed above. Inherited muscle disorders and infections together cause the majority of <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> in children.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhabdomyolysis</b> is {{recognized}} in horses. Horses {{can develop a}} number of muscle disorders, many of which may progress to <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> Of these, some cause isolated attacks of <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> (e.g., dietary deficiency in vitamin E and selenium, poisoning associated with pasture or agricultural poisons such as organophosphates), while others predispose to exertional <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> (e.g., the hereditary condition equine polysaccharide storage myopathy). 5–10% of thoroughbred horses and some standardbred horses suffer from the condition equine exertional rhabdomyolysis; no specific cause has been identified, but an underlying muscle calcium regulation disorder is suspected.|$|E
5|$|The {{exact number}} of cases of <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> is {{difficult}} to establish, because different definitions have been used. In 1995, hospitals in the U.S. reported 26,000 cases of <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> Up to 85% of people with major traumatic injuries will experience some degree of <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> Of those with <b>rhabdomyolysis,</b> 10–50% develop acute kidney injury. The risk is higher in people with a history of illicit drug use, alcohol misuse or trauma when compared to muscle diseases, and it is particularly high if multiple contributing factors occur together. <b>Rhabdomyolysis</b> accounts for 7–10% of all cases of acute kidney injury in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Any form {{of muscle}} damage of {{sufficient}} severity can cause <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> Multiple causes can be present simultaneously in one person. Some have an underlying muscle condition, usually hereditary in nature, {{that makes them}} more prone to <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Bible {{may contain}} an early account of <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> In , the Pentateuch {{says that the}} Jews demanded meat while {{traveling}} in the desert; God sent quail {{in response to the}} complaints, and people ate large quantities of quail meat. A plague then broke out, killing numerous people. <b>Rhabdomyolysis</b> after consuming quail was described in more recent times and called coturnism (after Coturnix, the main quail genus). Migrating quail consume large amounts of hemlock, a known cause of <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhabdomyolysis</b> {{occurs in}} about 26,000 {{people a year}} in the United States. While the {{condition}} has been commented on throughout history, the first modern description was following an earthquake in 1908. Important discoveries as to its mechanism were made during the Blitz of London in 1941. It is a significant problem for those injured in earthquakes and relief efforts for such disasters often include medical teams equipped to treat survivors with <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{depends on}} the underlying cause and whether any complications occur. <b>Rhabdomyolysis</b> complicated by acute kidney impairment in patients with traumatic injury may have a mortality rate of 20%. Admission to {{the intensive care unit}} is associated with a mortality of 22% in the absence of acute kidney injury, and 59% if kidney impairment occurs. Most people who have sustained kidney impairment due to <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> fully recover their kidney function.|$|E
5|$|Acute exertional <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> {{happens in}} 2% to 40% {{of people going}} through basic {{training}} for the United States military. In 2012, the United States military reported 402 cases.|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> may be suspected in {{anyone who has}} suffered trauma, crush injury or prolonged immobilization, {{but it may also}} be identified at a later stage due to deteriorating kidney function (abnormally raised or increasing creatinine and urea levels, falling urine output) or reddish-brown discoloration of the urine.|$|E
5|$|Disseminated {{intravascular}} coagulation, another {{complication of}} <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> {{and other forms}} of critical illness, may be suspected on the basis of unexpected bleeding or abnormalities in hematological tests, such as a decreasing platelet count or prolongation of the prothrombin time. The diagnosis can be confirmed with standard blood tests for DIC, such as D-dimer.|$|E
5|$|High {{potassium}} levels {{tend to be}} {{a feature}} of severe <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> Electrocardiography (ECG) may show whether the elevated potassium levels are affecting the conduction system of the heart, as suggested by the presence of T wave changes or broadening of the QRS complex. Low calcium levels may be present in the initial stage due to binding of free calcium to damaged muscle cells.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhabdomyolysis</b> is a {{condition}} in which damaged skeletal muscle breaks down rapidly. Symptoms may include muscle pains, weakness, vomiting, and confusion. There may be tea-colored urine or an irregular heartbeat. Some of the muscle breakdown products, such as the protein myoglobin, are harmful to the kidneys and may lead to kidney failure.|$|E
5|$|A line of rats with {{hereditary}} kidney cancer {{were developed}} by Japanese researchers. They have a mutation in the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very early in life that develop into clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; they also are prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear cell hyperplasia as well as <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> Homozygotes do not survive to birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotally {{injection}} of alprazolam has been reported, causing dangerous damage to blood vessels, closure {{of blood vessels}} (embolization) and decay of muscle tissue (<b>rhabdomyolysis).</b> Alprazolam is not very soluble in water—when crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, alprazolam, in one case, was distributed on blotter paper {{in a manner similar}} to LSD.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species have}} a hot to very acrid taste {{and can cause}} {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms. Despite this, such species are eaten in some regions, e.g. Lactarius torminosus in Finland or Russia. Often, they are parboiled or pickled to make them palatable, and sometimes, they are used as spice, for example Russula emetica in Eastern Europe. Some species are however truly poisonous: the East Asian and North American Russula subnigricans causes <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> and is potentially lethal, and Lactarius turpis from Eurasia contains a mutagenic substance.|$|E
5|$|The major {{side effects}} include dilated pupils, blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, extreme alertness, pruritus, confusion, agitation, tremor, {{extrapyramidal}} symptoms (dystonia, akathisia), headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, vomiting, chest pain, hallucinations, paresthesia, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, collapse, hyperventilation, sweating, hyperthermia and problems with urine retention. The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events, renal toxicity, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> and seizure. Blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or {{as part of}} a medicolegal death investigation.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for {{hyperthermia}} includes reducing muscle overactivity via sedation with a benzodiazepine. More {{severe cases}} may require muscular paralysis with vecuronium, intubation, and artificial ventilation. Suxamethonium {{is not recommended}} for muscular paralysis as it may {{increase the risk of}} cardiac dysrhythmia from hyperkalemia associated with <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> Antipyretic agents are not recommended as the increase in body temperature is due to muscular activity, not a hypothalamic temperature set point abnormality.|$|E
5|$|Hypokalemia (low blood {{potassium}} levels) commonly {{occurs during}} attacks; levels below 3.0mmol/l are typically encountered. Magnesium and phosphate levels are often {{found to be}} decreased. Creatine kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening). Electromyography shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced.|$|E
5|$|Muscle biopsy can {{be useful}} if an episode of <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> {{is thought to be}} the result of an {{underlying}} muscle disorder. A biopsy sample taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will show only evidence of cell death or may appear normal. Taking the sample is therefore delayed for several weeks or months. The histopathological appearance on the biopsy indicates the nature of the underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by ragged red fibers. Biopsy sites may be identified by medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhabdomyolysis</b> {{may cause}} kidney failure by several mechanisms. The most {{important}} is the accumulation of myoglobin in the kidney tubules. Normally, the blood protein haptoglobin binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin. Myoglobinuria, the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in plasma exceeds 0.5–1.5mg/dl; once plasma levels reach 100mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient {{for it to be}} visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the , myoglobin interacts with Tamm–Horsfall protein in the nephron to form casts (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to constriction of the blood vessels and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to the kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to acute tubular necrosis, the destruction of the cells of tubules. Glomerular filtration rate falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with vitamin D processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{treatment}} for some symptoms may be required. One {{of the most}} important treatments is the control of agitation due to the extreme possibility of injury to the person themselves or caregivers, benzodiazepines should be administered at first sign of this. Physical restraints are not recommended for agitation or delirium as they may contribute to mortality by enforcing isometric muscle contractions that are associated with severe lactic acidosis and hyperthermia. If physical restraints are necessary for severe agitation they must be rapidly replaced with pharmacological sedation. The agitation can cause a large amount of muscle breakdown. This breakdown can cause severe damage to the kidneys through a condition called <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{mushroom}} {{species are}} poisonous to humans, with toxicities ranging from slight digestive problems or allergic reactions {{as well as}} hallucinations to severe organ failures and death. Genera with mushrooms containing deadly toxins include Conocybe, Galerina, Lepiota, and, the most infamous, Amanita. The latter genus includes the destroying angel (A.virosa) and the death cap (A.phalloides), {{the most common cause}} of deadly mushroom poisoning. The false morel (Gyromitra esculenta) is occasionally considered a delicacy when cooked, yet can be highly toxic when eaten raw. Tricholoma equestre was considered edible until it was implicated in serious poisonings causing <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> Fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria) also cause occasional non-fatal poisonings, mostly as a result of ingestion for its hallucinogenic properties. Historically, fly agaric was used by different peoples in Europe and Asia and its present usage for religious or shamanic purposes is reported from some ethnic groups such as the Koryak people of north-eastern Siberia.|$|E
5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b> Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E
25|$|Musculoskeletal: muscle hypertrophy, muscle strains, tendon ruptures, <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Niacin also is {{proved to}} {{increase}} the risk of myopathy or <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tissue destruction, {{which can}} occur in hemolysis, surgery, infarction, crush syndrome, <b>rhabdomyolysis,</b> {{cerebral}} bleeding, etc.|$|E
25|$|Dark orange {{to brown}} urine {{can be a}} symptom of jaundice, <b>rhabdomyolysis,</b> or Gilbert's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Renal: renal hypertrophy, nephropathy, acute {{renal failure}} (secondary to <b>rhabdomyolysis),</b> focal {{segmental}} glomerulosclerosis, renal cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Markedly {{elevated}} CPK levels or if a myopathy {{is suspected}} or diagnosed after dosing of atorvastatin has begun. Very rarely, atorvastatin may cause <b>rhabdomyolysis,</b> {{and it may}} be very serious leading to acute renal failure due to myoglobinuria. If <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> is suspected or diagnosed, atorvastatin therapy should be discontinued immediately. The likelihood of developing a myopathy is increased by the co-administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, niacin, and azole antifungals.|$|E
25|$|Rare (<0.1% of patients): neutropenia, {{first degree}} heart block, hypotension, hypertension, pancreatitis, dysphagia, oliguria, <b>rhabdomyolysis,</b> suicidal {{thoughts}} or behavior.|$|E
25|$|Interactions with clofibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, {{which are}} fibrates used in {{accessory}} therapy {{in many forms}} of hypercholesterolemia, usually in combination with statins, {{increase the risk of}} myopathy and <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Common {{adverse effects}} include headache, nausea, diarrhea, {{abdominal}} pain, fatigue, and dizziness. Infrequent adverse effects include rash, itch, flatulence, constipation, anxiety, and depression. Also infrequently, PPI use {{may be associated}} with occurrence of myopathies, including the serious reaction <b>rhabdomyolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Equine exertional <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> (ER, {{also known}} as tying up, azoturia, or Monday morning disease) is a {{syndrome}} that damages the muscle tissue in horses. It is usually due to overfeeding a horse carbohydrates and {{appears to have a}} genetic link.|$|E
25|$|Myopathy with {{elevation}} of creatine kinase (CK, aka CPK) and <b>rhabdomyolysis</b> {{are the most}} serious side effects, occurring rarely {{at a rate of}} 2.3 to 9.1 per 10,000 person-years among patients taking atorvastatin. As mentioned previously, atorvastatin should be discontinued immediately if this occurs.|$|E
