2500|$|In {{the context}} of BoP and {{international}} monetary systems, [...] the <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> is the currency or other store of value that is primarily used by nations for their foreign reserves. [...] BoP imbalances tend to manifest as hoards of the <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> being amassed by surplus countries, [...] with deficit countries building debts denominated in the <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> or at least depleting their supply. Under a gold standard, the <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> for {{all members of the}} standard is gold. [...] In the Bretton Woods system, either gold or the U.S. dollar could serve as the <b>reserve</b> <b>asset,</b> though its smooth operation depended on countries apart from the US choosing to keep most of their holdings in dollars.|$|R

We argue that optimal state-contingent variations in <b>asset</b> <b>income</b> taxation increase welfare, alter the {{monetary policy transmission mechanism}} and insure against liquidity traps. These findings are explained by an endogenous association amongst taxation, the effective {{rate of return}} on assets, the inflationary output gap and credit spreads. Such unique link operates via a working-capital cost channel, and affords the policy maker an additional degree of freedom in stabilizing the economy.

50|$|Foreign-exchange {{reserves}} are called <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> {{in the balance}} of payments and are located in the capital account. Hence, they are usually {{an important part of the}} international investment position of a country. The {{reserves are}} labeled as <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> under assets by functional category. In terms of financial <b>assets</b> classifications, the <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> can be classified as Gold bullion, Unallocated gold accounts, Special drawing rights, currency, Reserve position in the IMF, interbank position, other transferable deposits, other deposits, debt securities, loans, equity (listed and unlisted), investment fund shares and financial derivatives, such as forward contracts and options. There is no counterpart for <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> in liabilities of the International Investment Position. Usually, when the monetary authority of a country has some kind of liability, this will be included in other categories, such as Other Investments.

40|$|We use the National Transfer Accounts {{methodology}} {{to calculate}} private <b>asset</b> <b>income</b> by age {{for the years}} 1979 – 2011. We analyze age profiles using three indicators of intergenerational equity. Monetary <b>asset</b> <b>income</b> shows no evidence of generational breaks {{to the benefit of}} the baby-boom generation. On the contrary, baby-boomers suffered from the high interest rates that they paid to become homeowners. Imputed rents show an obvious breakdown of intergenerational equity when we use an inter-age and intergenerational indicator. This indicator compares the per capita <b>asset</b> <b>income</b> at a given age with the average <b>asset</b> <b>income</b> of people aged 18 – 85. It gives the relative situation of one age group compared to its contemporaries and it also gives the relative situation of one generation when we compare birth cohorts over time. We find that the cohort born in 1950 benefited from a better position than their successors. Moreover, the cohorts born before the war and during the war appear to be even more favored than the baby-boomers. The cohorts born in 1930 and in 1940 have a better situation than the previous generations and a better position than the following generations...|$|R

5000|$|Special Drawing Rights (ISO 4217 {{currency}} code XDR,also abbreviated SDR) are supplementary foreign-exchange <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> defined and {{maintained by the}} International Monetary Fund (IMF).

(2) Extending the “range”-type follow-ups to cover all assets resulted in major nonresponse benefits.

40|$|The global reserve {{system has}} {{returned}} {{to the top of the}} agenda in debates about international monetary reform. Much of the contemporary discussion draws on familiar issues but it has been given a new relevance in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008 / 09. One particular focus relates to the composition of international <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> and the role of the dollar. Will the dollar’s preeminent position be eroded and will the dollar be replaced by other international currencies? This paper examines the factors that determine a currency’s international status and assesses various candidate currencies including the euro and the Chinese renminbi. It also analyses the Special Drawing Right (SDR) as an international <b>reserve</b> <b>asset.</b> It concludes that, while there may be advantages in enhancing the SDR ’s role and endeavouring to implement the commitment made in the Second Amendment to the IMF’s Articles of Agreement to encourage it to become the world’s principal international <b>reserve</b> <b>asset,</b> the more likely outcome is that the dollar will retain its status as the main international currency, although it may be joined by other currencies in a multiple currency system. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper derives the Ramsey optimal {{policy for}} taxing <b>asset</b> <b>income</b> {{in a model}} where {{government}} expenditure {{is a function of}} net output or the inputs that produce it. Extending Judd (1999), I demonstrate that the canonical result that the optimal tax on capital income is zero in the medium to long term is a special case of a more general model. Employing a vector error correction model to estimate the relationship between government consumption and net output for the United States between 1947 Q 1 to 2013 Q 2, I demonstrate that this special case is empirically implausible, and show how the cointegrating vector can be used to determine the optimal tax schedule. I simulate a version of the model using the empirical estimates to measure the welfare implications of changing the tax rate on <b>asset</b> <b>income,</b> and contrast these results with those generated in a version of the model where government consumption is purely exogenous. The shifting pattern of welfare measurements confirms the theoretical results. I calculate that the prevailing effective tax rate on net <b>asset</b> <b>income</b> in the US between 1995 and 2011 averaged 0. 441. Hence abolishing the tax completely does generate welfare improvements, though only by the equivalent of less than a one percent permanent increase in consumption [...] -less than a third the implied welfare benefit when the endogeneity of the government consumption is ignored. The maximum welfare improvement from shifting part of the burden of tax from capital to labour is the equivalent of a permanent increase in consumption of between only 1. 173 and 1. 304 % and is attained when the tax rate on <b>asset</b> <b>income</b> is lowered to between 0. 18 and 0. 2.
