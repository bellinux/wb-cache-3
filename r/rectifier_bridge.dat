5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a <b>rectifier</b> <b>bridge</b> converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E

If the voltage stability is not too important you can use a Zener diode as a regulator, which is a 2 terminal device and would eliminate R4 and R5 used for a resistive voltage divider in the schematic above.|$|E

40|$|A current {{regulation}} under IEC- 555 imposes requirements on the harmonic current content, {{which can be}} sent back to utility lines for all consumer electronic devices consuming more than 75 W of power. To meet that requirement, the active Power Factor Correction (PFC) must be employed. The most common PFC solution, a boost converter, requires the use a full-bridge diode rectifier ahead of the boost converter in the circuit. This design greatly impairs the efficiency, as the two diodes in the bridge rectifier are in the direct power path for either positive or negative half-cycle of input ac line voltage. Thegoal {{of this paper is to}} propose a topology for induction motor drive with reduced components in the <b>rectifier</b> <b>bridge.</b> The utilization of 2 switches replacing 4 switches in the <b>rectifier</b> <b>bridge</b> of induction motor drive helps to implement a low-cost system for various applications.
