5|$|After the Fountain is {{destroyed}} and the Circle defeated, Sahin returns to Turkey, and Lizzie, {{with all her}} Spanish gold sunk {{to the bottom of}} the lake, leaves for the Caribbean: however, it is ambiguously stated that she and Morgan reunited several years later and a romance eventually blossomed between them, implying that she was the mother of Morgan's children, making her also an ancestor of all future Blacks featured in the campaign. Morgan is last seen wondering about the significance of the Fountain and whether it <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Fountain of Youth, and is seen refilling his empty canteen from the water of the lake.|$|E
25|$|A long tram line, about 17 versts (18 kilometres) long, {{was laid}} from the Poshtova Square in the Podil neighbourhood, over the Dnieper on the Nicholas Bridge, through the Peredmostna and Nikolska Slobodka neighbourhoods, {{and to the}} {{neighbouring}} town of Brovary. The line was used until the mid-1930s, and was a one-way line with side-skirts for oncoming trams to drive into. This had made the trip even longer than it <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> <b>The</b> cost was 35 kopecks, {{a fair amount of}} money at the time. Nevertheless, the trams were always packed with passengers.|$|E
25|$|One of {{his first}} tasks as University Architect was to persuade the august {{committee}} to accept the notion that Perpendicular Gothic <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only right and appropriate style for the building, because of its association with most colleges of both Oxford and Cambridge. The notes that he made for this speech are still in existence. Blacket was able to show the committee the sort of building that he intended, having to hand J. T. Emmett's design of the Congregational College on Finchley Road, north of London. Blacket asked his friend, the artist Conrad Martens, to create a watercolour drawing from his plans and elevations. Although the plans can not be located, the drawing {{is owned by the}} University and was engraved to appear in a newspaper.|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{usually are}} {{of the opinion that}} this {{inscription}} does not relate to the poet: a military career would not fit well with the pronounced anti-militarism of the Satires and, moreover, the Dalmatian legions do not seem to have existed prior to 166 AD. Therefore, it seems likely that this reference is to a Juvenal who was a later relative of the poet, however, as they both came from Aquinum and were associated with the goddess Ceres (the only deity the Satires shows much respect for). If the theory that connects these two Juvenals is correct, then the inscription does show that Juvenal's family was reasonably wealthy, and that, if the poet <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> son of a foreign freedman, then his descendants assimilated into the Roman class structure more quickly than typical. Green thinks it more likely that the tradition of the freedman father is false and, that Juvenal's ancestors had been minor nobility of Roman Italy of relatively ancient descent.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode a B+, describing it as [...] "a ho-hum X-Files knock-off". Handlen {{felt that the}} acting was strong, and that the references to both Chernobyl and apocalyptic prophecies formed a good basis for the episode; however, {{he noted that the}} script's uncertainty as to whether its villain <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Antichrist caused it to lose impact. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, praising its [...] " [...] incredibly tight script" [...] and describing it as [...] "one of the best examples of Millennium careful balancing act between reality and the otherworldly".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{helped to}} {{elaborate}} the backstory of The Smoking Man, the series' chief antagonist. William B. Davis, {{the actor who}} played the character, later noted, [...] "As the story developed, we developed a relationship between Cigarette-Smoking Man and Mulder's apparent father, and Cigarette-Smoking Man and Mulder's mother; then we started backfilling with an historical connection." [...] Carter explained that the episode {{was the start of}} the series' greater conspiracy: [...] "It's an interesting development because it <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> development of the conspiracy.

Some BSAA pilots, however, have expressed scepticism at this theory; convinced that Cook would not have started his descent without a positive indication that he had crossed the mountains, they have suggested that strong winds may have brought down the craft in some other way. One of the pilots recalled that [...] "we had all been warned not to enter cloud over the mountains as the turbulence and icing posed too great a threat." ...|$|E

[...] In contrast, Don Taylor, who was a director in the drama department at the time, later claimed that he felt Newman was unsuited to the position of Head of Drama, writing: [...] "To put it brutally, I was deeply offended that the premier position in television drama, {{at a time when it}} <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> National Theatre of the Air, had been given to a man whose values were entirely commercial, and who had no more than a layman's knowledge of the English theatrical tradition, let alone the drama of Europe and the wider world." ...|$|E

500|$|Early in 1929 Heseltine {{received}} two offers from Beecham which temporarily restored {{his sense of}} purpose. Beecham had founded the Imperial League of Opera (ILO) in 1927; he now invited Heseltine to edit the ILO journal. Beecham also asked Heseltine to help organise a festival to honour Delius, which the conductor was planning for October 1929. Although Heseltine's enthusiasm for Delius's music had diminished, he accepted the assignment, and travelled to Grez in search of forgotten compositions that could be resurrected for the festival. He declared that he was delighted to discover Cynara, for voice and orchestra, abandoned since 1907. For the festival, Heseltine prepared many of the programme notes for individual concerts and supplied a concise biography of the composer. According to Delius's wife Jelka: [...] "Next to Beecham, he [...] <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> soul of the thing".|$|E

[...] "We had very little time," [...] Gilmour recalled in a May 2003 interview. [...] "Syd was very difficult, we got that very frustrated feeling: Look, it's your fucking career, mate.

500|$|The team quickly {{recognized}} that [...] "the controller <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{kind of magic}} sauce for {{what we wanted to}} do". [...] They identified three aspects of gameplay that they felt made the game stand out. These aspects included the note-matching aspect and the showmanship created by the use of the whammy bar and tilting of the guitar within the game. The third key aspect was the use of Star Power [...] "to provide a little more depth to the gameâ€” some replay value, some interest for people as they were playing beyond just hitting the notes". Harmonix used third party controllers made for GuitarFreaks that were already on the market for development of the game until RedOctane had prepared prototypes for the Guitar Hero controller. [...] The controller initially had pressure-sensitive fret buttons to mimic the playing of a real guitar, but the idea was dropped as it made the gameplay too complex. [...] The idea of using the whammy bar to boost Star Power, in addition to altering the pitch of sustained notes was only realized about a month before the completion of the game. The team had spent [...] "precious development time and resources" [...] into creating a free-style model that would have allowed players to improvise during songs but ultimately cut it as they could not work the feature into the existing gameplay.|$|E

500|$|Sean Connery was {{the first}} actor to portray Bond on film in Dr. No (1962). An amateur bodybuilder, {{he had come to}} the {{attention}} of the Bond film producers after several appearances in British films from the late 1950s. At a muscular 6'2", Fleming originally disapproved of his casting as James Bond, believing him to be an overgrown stuntman who lacked the finesse and elegance to play James Bond; he envisaged a suave actor, such as David Niven playing the role. Producer Albert R. Broccoliâ€”known to all as Cubbyâ€”disagreed with Fleming's view, later commenting that [...] "I wanted a ballsy guy... put a bit of veneer over that tough Scottish hide and you've got Fleming's Bond instead of all the mincing poofs we had applying for the job". Eon's choice of Connery was also based on his looks and sex appeal, an appeal that would later be echoed by Honor Blackman who said, after appearing with Connery in Goldfinger, [...] "He was exceedingly handsome, virile and sexy and that <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> tenor of what the script was always trying to display". After Connery was chosen, director Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor [...] "in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool".|$|E
500|$|Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet {{ambassador}} to Afghanistan, {{was able to}} persuade Aslam Watanjar, Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy and Sherjan Mazdoryar {{to become part of}} a conspiracy against Amin. These three men put pressure on Taraki, who by this time believed that [...] "he <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 'great leader'", to sack Amin from office. It is unknown if Amin knew anything about the conspiracy against him, but it was after the cabinet reorganisation that he talked about his dissatisfaction. On 26 March the PDPA Politburo and the Council of Ministers approved the extension of the powers of the executive branch, and the establishment of the Homeland Higher Defence Council (HHDC) to handle security matters. Many analysts of the day regarded Amin's appointment as Prime Minister as an increase in his powers at the expense of Taraki. However, the reorganisation of the cabinet and the strengthening of Taraki's position as Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, had reduced the authority of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was, due to the strengthening of the executive, now appointed by the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council. While Amin could appoint and dismiss new ministers, he needed Taraki's consent to actually do so. Another problem for Amin was that while the Council of Ministers was responsible to the Revolutionary Council and its chairman, individual ministers were only responsible to Taraki. When Amin became Prime Minister, he was responsible for planning, finance and budgetary matters, the conduct of foreign policy, and for order and security. The order and security responsibilities had been taken over by the HHDC, which was chaired by Taraki. While Amin was HHDC Deputy Chairman, the majority of HHDC members were members of the anti-Amin faction. For instance, the HHDC membership included Watanjar the Minister of National Defence, Interior Minister Mazdoryar, the President of the Political Affairs of the Armed Forces Mohammad Iqbal, Mohammad Yaqub, the Chief of the General Staff, the Commander of the Afghan Air Force Nazar Mohammad and Assadullah Sarwari the head of ASGA, the Afghan secret police.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} Jeremy Davies character Daniel Faraday. Daniel {{was introduced in the}} fourth season and was originally intended to be a minor character only. However, his quiet demeanor and seemingly good heart made him a favorite with the fans, so Lindelof and Cuse decided to expand Daniel's role, which has led to him being a key player in Losts eventual resolution. In response to Daniel's death, Cuse said, [...] "It was an incredibly painful thing to kill this beloved character, but we feel thatâ€™s what this show has to do. His death is kind of the culminating event in the entire season. It really ends one chapter and commences the start of the final chapter of the entire series." [...] Once the show runners explained that to Davies, he was saddened that his full-time status on Lost was coming to an end, but put the story [...] "above his own personal self". Damon seconded Carlton's emotions, adding that Jeremy took the news well: [...] "When Carlton and I called Jeremy to explain what was going to be happening with Daniel, weâ€™ve never had a more awesome exit interview with somebody on the show. For us, Daniel <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> cornerstone of the fifth season â€“ he really shined. I canâ€™t imagine what Season 5 would have looked like without Jeremy Davies. When you think about all the crazy stuff that had to come out of that guyâ€™s mouth, for him to be as interesting and emotional and poetic as he was is really extraordinary." [...] The cast of the show said Davies would be missed, though he may not be done with Lost â€” Carlton commented that Jeremy's [...] "full-time" [...] status was over, but dead characters have been known to reappear on the show. Michael Emerson, who plays Ben, said Davies was [...] "a great sensitive guy who got deep into his character, he really lived it." ...|$|E
