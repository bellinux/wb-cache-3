40|$|A {{development}} of pension scheme {{system in the}} People's Poland has heavily depended on the economic situation {{of the country and}} barely followed increase in costs of living and in wages. A lack of built-in system mechanisms adjusting level <b>of</b> pension <b>benefits</b> to level <b>of</b> wages or cost of living indices resulted in a discontinuous {{development of}} the pension system which in turn led to a further discrepancies in levels of pensions and wages. <b>Revalorization</b> <b>of</b> all previous pension benefits is thus a basic achievement of the Dec. 1982 pension reform. The previous benefits are to equal in three subsequent stages (up to Jan. 1, 1985), the level of the presently granted benefits, the built-in valorisation mechanisms are to be introduced starting from Jan. 1, 1986. Revalorisation of the previously granted pension benefits was carried out tin two areas. Basis of assessment of all previous pensions was revalorized proportionally to the period of time from the date of their granting, also a value <b>of</b> pension <b>benefits</b> was recalculated with an application of increased (to 3000 zł) degression value and increased percentage indices for particular types <b>of</b> pension <b>benefits</b> and pension allowances. <b>Revalorization</b> <b>of</b> wages as a basis of assessment of pension comprised the inclusion of compensations paid after the 1861 and 1982 increases of prices of consumption goods. This however, resulted in a reduction of value of dependents' pensions, especially in a numerous families which can raise abjections. The degression threshold moreover, has been situated on a too low level equaling only 60 % of a lowest pension which gives occasion to include pensions calculated on a basis of wages even 50 % higher from the lowest ones to the portfolio of lowest pensions (as regards dependents' pensions). Rules of valorization to be introduced in future are correct, especially the adoption of the so called valorization ratio can maintain a stable relation between a pension and a basis of its assessment, in spite of increases in wages being a basis of valorization. What is raising objections though, is putting off a date of introduction a yearly valorization scheme to Jan. 1, 1986. A further increase of costs of living and wages must be accounted for in the present situation of economic crisis and rapidly developing inflation. Further discrepancies in levels of pensions calculated on the basis of 1982 indices vs. levelsof dynamically growing wages will eventually make the 1986 valorisation operation economically difficult.

To do this, I explore some of the productive links between the stance of anarchism and recent work in non-representational theorising in the social sciences (Ingold, 2015; Dewsbury, 2010; Thrift, 2008). By doing so, I do not suggest that non-representational theory has to be anarchist. Rather, I argue that it lends itself strongly to a reconsideration, even a <b>revalorization,</b> <b>of</b> anarchism in the social sciences. Finally, to illustrate this link I will turn in the last section to the sociologist Andrew Pickering (2010) for his thought-provoking exposition of performative, non-representational approaches as a sustainable and viable alternative social ontology.

40|$|Although {{traditional}} verbal charms and incantation rituals {{have received}} extensive attention in Slavic ethnolinguistics and folklore studies, the need still exists {{for a more}} in-depth poetic and contextual (re) analysis of ritual folk texts, more in particular of the interrelation between their stylistic, compositional, referential and functional properties. In this context, the article points towards the possible <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> an integrated pragmatic and (ethno) poetic text analysis that centers on the semiotic concepts of iconicity and indexicality. Through an examination {{of a number of}} South and East Slavic sample cases, the authors discuss the various ways in which poetic and figurative stylization and structuring in verbal charms correlates (indexically and iconically) with their meanings and functions within the performative (actional-ritual) and broader sociocultural context. In doing so, they attempt to demonstrate at least partially how an analysis along poetic-pragmatic guidelines may prove fruitful for the <b>revalorization</b> <b>of</b> the poetic, performative, social and cultural efficiency of charms and incantations as verbal rituals, and thence for a recovery of the sociocultural ‘memory’ of these ritual texts...|$|R

Thus the aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of using glassy wastes as friction material in automotive brakes and, moreover, to assess whether this <b>revalorization</b> technique <b>of</b> ultimate wastes is both economical viable and environmentally friendly. Specific mechanical properties (friction, wear rate etc) were measured and appeared to be better than those of conventional commercial brake pads. To assess the environmental impact of these composite materials, risk assessment studies were conducted to evaluate the remobilization of hazardous species such as heavy metals that are concentrated in the wastes. Leaching tests were conducted to simulate the effects of weathering. The alteration solutions were analyzed by ICP-MS to evaluate the dissolution rate of the wastes matrix and the amount of heavy metals released. Thermal shock experiments were conducted with laser ablation and ICP-MS to monitor the secondary products rejected at high temperature.

From the analysis of results, it emerges that there are significant differences on the quality of water among the sample areas studied. The degradation of groundwater quality is mainly due to the pollution caused by the rural use of land, as well as its intensive exploitation.
