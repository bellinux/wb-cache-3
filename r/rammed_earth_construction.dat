40|$|Raw {{earth is}} used by men as a {{building}} material {{for thousands of years}} and remains today {{as one of the most}} widespread construction systems in the world. <b>Rammed</b> <b>earth</b> and adobe are the two main <b>earth</b> <b>construction</b> techniques used in Portugal. In Algarve, which is the continental region located at Portugal southern boundary, <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> is the prevailing one, either in small rural buildings or in large military fortifications. The study of <b>earth</b> <b>construction</b> is justified for several reasons. First, the necessity to preserve an irreplaceable cultural and architectural heritage. Second, because it is still the most affordable resource in countries called "underdeveloped". Finally, because it represents an environmental, social and economical sustainable alternative, which is the use of a natural, local and recyclable material. The major problems of <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> <b>constructions</b> are there vulnerability to earthquakes, and the ones related to durability issues when exposed to weather conditions. Being <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> a sustainable <b>construction</b> technique, it is very important to assess the seismic resistance of this type of traditional buildings, namely when subjected to offshore earthquakes like the one that occurred on 28 February 1969. In this work, several stochastic ground motion simulations of offshore earthquakes were carried out to assess the seismic behaviour of <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> walls located in the Algarve's coastal area.

40|$|<b>Rammed</b> <b>earth</b> <b>constructions</b> exhibit {{strength}} and deformation properties that evolve {{as a function}} of the relative humidity of the air in contact with the walls.

This work studies, through finite element simulation, the impact of the hygroscopic transfers through the wall on the structural response of a classical two-storey <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> building. The coupling between the mechanical and the hygroscopic behaviour is considered by the concept of effective stress for unsaturated soils, in order to reproduce the effect of suction on the strength, the stiffness and the volumetric variations of the <b>rammed</b> <b>earth.</b> The simulations show classical deformation of the structure due to distributed load on the floors while the hygroscopic changes in the <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> (essentially drying) induce additional displacements of the walls that remain in a very acceptable range.

40|$|<b>Rammed</b> <b>earth</b> <b>constructions</b> {{are known}} for their high seismic vulnerability, which menaces their {{preservation}} and puts in risk the life of millions of people living in regions with important seismic hazard. The poor conservation condition of many of these constructions largely contributes for the aforementioned situation. The presence of cracks is one common type of damage occurring in the walls, which debilitates their structural behaviour both for in-plane and out-of-plane loading. The injection of grouts has been studied recently as a solution to repair this type of damage. However, the repair effectiveness of this technique needs further research. This paper presents an experimental program, where the effectiveness of the injection of a mud and a commercial grout base on hydraulic lime for repairing cracks in <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> is compared.

40|$|AbstractEarth {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest and most widespread construction system. Around 30 % of world population lives in earth buildings. About 50 % of population in developing countries, including the majority of rural areas, and at least 20 % of urban and marginal urban areas, lives in earth buildings. The main general objectives of this study are the behaviour characterisation of adobe and <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> <b>constructions</b> along with the research for the development of retrofitting and seismic performance enhancement solutions, considering the relevant earthen heritage built in Portugal. In fact, until the first half of the last century, earth was commonly adopted as a construction material in Portugal.

The consolidation of the knowledge on this technique and on the mechanical behaviour of adobe masonry will play a fundamental role on the preservation of the earthen built heritage. In addition, it may contribute to the development of innovative <b>earth</b> <b>construction</b> solutions for new buildings, following current concerns but also respecting structural safety demands, which will allow accommodating the increasing interest on this type of building solutions. The mechanical properties of adobe units and mortars were studied and a series of tests for the characterization of the adobe masonry behaviour were carried out, in the Department of Civil Engineering of the University of Aveiro, namely: (i) bond strength and (ii) joint shear tests.
