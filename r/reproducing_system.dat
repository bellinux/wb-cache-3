The performance reproducing pianos have several applications, e.g., a recorded piano performance can be edited in order to correct notes or to adjust dynamics and timing.

This paper {{describes}} {{the results obtained}} with several new techniques which {{are being used to}} extend the frequency bandwidth limits and the signal to noise ratios of instrumentation magnetic tape record/ <b>reproduce</b> <b>systems.</b> During the past decade, wideband magnetic tape information recording densities have advanced in several stages to the currently used 60 to 80 micro inch wavelengths. The new techniques described in this paper now make it practical to record and reproduce wavelengths in the order of 30 to 40 micro inches. This results in a frequency bandwidth of 1. 0 MHz at a tape speed of 30 inches per second. In comparison with present wideband systems this means an improvement of 2 X in bandwidth, or a reduction of tape speed by one half is now possible while maintaining approximately 20 dB broadband signal to noise ratio with a track width of. 025 inches. This width provides 28 tracks per inch of tape width. This improved performance has been obtained by combining recent improvements in "High Energy" tape, narrow gap ferrite record heads and ferrite reproduce heads. Using a systems approach, electronic signal processing circuits have been developed which coordinate these improvements in tape and heads, resulting in optimized "high performance" record/ <b>reproduce</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

Its renowned research departments invested considerable resources in determining studio monitor suited to their different broadcasting needs, and also {{created their own}} models from first principles. A 1958 research paper identified the sound goal, in a monaural system:It is assumed that the ideal to be aimed at {{in the design of}} a sound <b>reproducing</b> <b>system</b> is realism, i.e. that the listener should be able to imagine himself to be {{in the presence of the}} original source of sound.There is, of course, scope for legitimate experiment in the processing of the reproduced signals in an endeavour to improve on nature, however, realism, or as near an approach to it as may be possible, ought surely to be regarded as the normal condition and avoidable departures from this state, while justified upon occasion, should not be allowed to become a permanent feature of the system.In designing a loudspeaker, the BBC established the compromise that had to be established between size, weight and cost considerations. Two-way designs were preferred due to the inherently simpler crossover network, but were subject to the limitations of speaker driver technology at the time [...] - [...] there were few high-frequency units available at the time that functioned down to 1.5 kHz, meaning that the woofer must operate in a predictable manner up to about 2 kHz. The BBC developed a two-way studio monitor in 1959, the LS5/1, using a 58mm Celestion tweeter and 380mm Goodmans bass unit, but continually had problems with consistency of the bass units. The successful testing of a 305mm bass cone made with new thermoplastics led to development and deployment of the LS5/5 and LS5/6 monitors that occupied only 60% volume of its predecessor.|$|E

They are discrete dynamical systems, each of which can have complex and varied behaviour. Here, we study a class of substitutive systems incorporating properties of both cellular automata and L-systems, that exhibits self-reproducing behaviour. A one-dimensional array of cells is considered, each cell has a set of modes or states which are determined by a number from Z/nZ ∗ (n prime). The behaviour of a cell depends on the states of its neighbours and obeys to an additive rule. It has also a cell-division mode, which allows the line of cells to grow. The behaviour of such a model can be complex, but, using algebraic techniques, we prove that it can describe a <b>reproducing</b> <b>system.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} {{study of}} <b>reproducing</b> <b>systems</b> involves the Gabor systems, that are {{generated by the}} action of translations and modulations on a single or finite family of functions in L 2 (Rn), and the affine systems, where the dilations are used rather than the modulations. In this paper, we show that the interplay of all three operators yield a wide variate of <b>reproducing</b> <b>systems,</b> and we employ the term wave packet systems, which has been used by other authors, to describe those function systems generated by the combined action of a class of translations, modulations and dilations on a finite family of functions. We will examine in detail both the continuous and discrete versions of these systems. We shall show that these systems can be studied by using a unified approach that the authors have developed in some of their previous work. 1. Preliminaries Before embarking in this study, it will be useful to introduce some notation and definitions. We consider three fundamental operators on L 2 (Rn) : the transla-tions Ty: (Ty f) (x) = f(x − y), where y ∈ Rn; the dilations Da: (Da f) (x) = |det a| 1 / 2 f(ax), where a ∈ GLn(R); and the modulations Mν: (Mν f) (x) = e 2 piiν·xf(x), where ν ∈ Rn. The Fourier transform is defined as f̂(ξ) = (Ff) (ξ) = Rn f(x) e− 2 piiξ·x dx, and the inverse Fourier transform is f̌(x) = (F− 1 f) (x) = Rn f(ξ) e 2 piix·ξ dξ. The following proposition, which is easily verified, states some basic properties of the translation, modulation and dilation operators. 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 42 C 15, 42 C 40.
