Effect of surface topography fractal parameters on average film thickness between the <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> for B 104 a- 70 mechanical seal was analyzed by theoretical calculation. The results showed that fractal dimension D and characteristic length scale G of the <b>end</b> <b>face</b> had a great influence on the average film thickness h 0, and h 0 decreased with the increased of D or decreased of G; h 0 decreased rapidly with the increased of D or with the decreased of G when the <b>end</b> <b>face</b> was coarser, however, it decreased slowly with the increased of D or with the decreased of G when the <b>end</b> <b>face</b> was smoother.

40|$|Abstract- Mechanical seal <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> are {{separated}} by a thin fluid film. The thickness of this film must be optimized so as to preventing the serious friction of two <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> and minimizing the fluid leakage. The micro scope condition monitoring of <b>end</b> <b>face</b> is of importance to ensure mechanical seals run normally. A method for measuring the film thickness of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> and detecting the friction of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> of mechanical seal has been presented in this paper.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} transmembrane potential {{changes at}} the ends of isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes during defibrillation-strength shocks given in the cellular refractory period. The myocytes were stimulated (Si pulse) to produce an action potential. Then a constant-field shock (S 2 pulse) with an electric field of 20 or 40 V/cm was given at an S 1 -S 2 interval of 50 msec. The cells were stained with potentiometric dye (di- 4 -ANEPPS), and the cell <b>end</b> <b>facing</b> the S 2 anode or cathode was illuminated with a laser while the fluorescence was recorded. During S 2, the cell <b>end</b> <b>facing</b> the S 2 cathode became more positive intracellu-larly, whereas the cell <b>end</b> <b>facing</b> the S 2 anode became more negative intracellularly. The S 2 -induced transmembrane potential change at the cell end (AVm) was determined relative to the amplitude of the Si-induced action potential (APA) in each recording (i. e., AVm/APA). In Tyrode's solution containing 4. 5 mM potassium, AVm/APA for 40 -V/cm S 2 was 1. 36 + 0. 34 at the cell <b>end</b> <b>facing</b> the S 2 cathode and- 1. 65 + 0. 61 at the cell <b>end</b> <b>facing</b> the S 2 anode (n= 9).

The rim's torque was divided into two parts, outer surface and <b>end</b> <b>faces.</b> The torque of outer surface was resulted by turbulent Taylor vortex flow in the radial gap between inner and outer cylinder. The torque of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> was resulted by radial outflow and inflow in the axial gap. Based on N-S equations {{angular momentum}} current was conserved in radial gap by neglecting of influence of <b>end</b> <b>faces.</b> We employed RANS solver to investigate the effect of the ratio between inner and outer cylinder radius on the torque of the outer surface by keeping the axial gap ratio. As such the effect of axial gap ratio on the torque of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> was explored by holding radial gap ratio.

The {{non-contact}} {{mechanical seal}} <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> opening friction condition detection and {{the measurement of}} film thickness when the <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> is just-lift-off, which are always key problems for scholars engaged in sealing industry for many years, {{but there is no}} effective solution. Acoustic emission(AE) signal generated in the running process of mechanical seal <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> has a plenty of information about the faces contact state. According to this, the thickness measurement of mechanical seal and opening condition monitoring technology by using particle filter are put forward based on the acoustic emission signal. Acoustic emission sensor is installed in the stationary ring seat, used for the indirect outer detection of the dynamic and stationary rings opening condition. The acoustic emission signals are processed by particle filter technology, and then the signal features are extracted in time domain, frequency domain and wavelet packet energy. A BP neural network model is established, the features of signal characteristic used as input of the model. It is finally realized that the mechanical seal <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> opening condition was recognized and the film thickness was measured. Eddy current sensor is installed inside the stationary ring and used for direct measurement of film thickness and verify the results got from the BP neural network.

40|$|AbstractThere is a {{transition}} of metal from the lateral and <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> of a continuously cast slab {{to the broad}} surface of the plate during the rolling process. The process of metal transition to the wide sides of the plate {{is the process of}} defect formation, because surface cracks and defects from the side and <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> transfer to the front surfaces of the plate. When rolling is over the cracks are located on the edges of the plate while the width corresponds to the width of the transition strips. Longitudinal edge cracking during plate hot rolling can occur as a consequence the following three factors combination: 1) transition of metal from the lateral and <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> to the broad surfaces of the strip; 2) the occurrence of tensile stresses during the metal transition; 3) reduced plasticity of the slab edges due to the lower temperature (≈ 900 - 950 °C).

40|$|Since the {{measurement}} of mechanical sealing film thickness and just-lift-off time is very difficult, the sealing film condition monitoring method based on acoustic emission signal is proposed. The mechanical seal acoustic emission signal present obvious characteristics of time-varying nonlinear and pulsating. In this paper, the acoustic emission signal is used to monitor the seal <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> just-lift-off time and friction condition. The acoustic emission signal is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition {{into a series of}} intrinsic mode function with independent characteristics of different time scales and different frequency band. The acoustic emission signal only generated by <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> friction is obtained by eliminating the false intrinsic mode function components. The correlation coefficient of acoustic emission signal and Multi-scale Laplace Wavelet is calculated. It is proved that the maximum frequency (8000 Hz) of the correlation coefficient is appeared at the spindle speed of 300 rpm. And at this time (300 rpm) the <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> have just lifted off.

This tedious and difficult work is prone to substantial inter- and intra-grader variability. This dissertation presents methods for automatic analysis of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst). Two features are extracted: the pith (centre core) position {{and the number of}} annual rings. The pith detection uses local orientations to estimate the centre of the annual rings {{in a manner that is}} robust to disturbances as knots and cracks as well as partial coverage of dirt or snow. The number of annual rings is counted using the polar distance transform, a tool developed here. This transform combines the image intensity and the circular shape of the rings so that the annual ring pattern can be outlined in rough and noisy images. First the marks on <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> from uneven sawing are removed using an automatic method developed in this work. The data are images of untreated <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> mostly acquired at sawmills.
