40|$|Historians {{have studied}} <b>ranching</b> {{extensively}} in Texas, Wyoming, and Montana. There are many monographs published on <b>ranches,</b> ranchers, and cowboys. Colfax and Union counties have an extensive number of <b>ranches.</b> These <b>ranches</b> are from {{as small as}} ten acres to as large as 590, 000 acres. These <b>ranches</b> {{in their own right}} deserve to be studied, especially since they were a part of at least two legitimate land grants: Maxwell Land Grant and Pablo Montoya Land Grant. In addition, some of these <b>ranches</b> exist because of the railroad, which runs through both counties. This thesis examines a few of the many <b>ranches</b> in this area. It also includes a brief history of the Santa Fe Trail Dry Cimarron Cutoff area. HistoryMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} <b>ranch</b> and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line increased the number of visitors, as the railroad featured the <b>ranch</b> in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the <b>ranch</b> was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E
