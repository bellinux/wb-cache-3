40|$|Collaboration between {{practitioners}} and researchers can increasingly {{be observed in}} research and development (R&D) projects in secondary schools. This article presents an analysis of cross-professional collaboration between teachers, school leaders and educational researchers and/or advisers as part of R&D projects in terms of three dimensions: reasons for collaboration, the division of <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> <b>tasks,</b> <b>and</b> the communication structure. Data were collected in interviews with participants from 12 Dutch projects, from documents and from meetings with participants. The results show that the parties involved can have the same reasons for cross-professional collaboration but that the external educational experts may also have additional objectives. <b>Roles</b> <b>and</b> <b>tasks</b> were divided in different ways, depending on who directs and guides the research and development, and whether teachers were involved as teacher researchers in the project. The communication structure appeared to be linked to the division of <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> <b>tasks,</b> but also to the number of participants in the project. The three dimensions proved to be valuable viewpoints to study cross-professional collaboration in R&D projects in Dutch secondary education. Furthermore, we distinguished four types of cross-professional collaboration in R&D projects. These types differ in {{the extent to which the}} school or the external party direct and guide the project: (a) School-directed collaboration; (b) School- and researcher-directed collaboration; (c) School- and adviser-directed collaboration; (d) Researcher-directed collaboration. Our findings can support participants to consciously choose a particular type of cross-professional collaboration that fits their purposes and specific situation...|$|R

This research was designed to provide information for training programs to increase the effectiveness of manufacturers' representatives as salespersons in the marketing channel. A modified Delphi technique was used to gather material from a series of judges and through many personal interviews. Knowledge accrued from those sources and through a literature review was used to develop two questionnaires. Those surveys were mailed to a group of veteran representatives and a second group composed of novice representatives. Data collected led to the identification of specific <b>roles,</b> <b>tasks,</b> <b>and</b> competencies necessary for the the effective practice of the profession of manufacturers' representative. Six <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> 32 <b>tasks</b> were identified by the respondents. The two groups did not agree on the ranking of the roles. A chi-square test revealed {{there was a significant difference}} in perception of some tasks between the two sample groups. Respondents also identified 154 competencies essential to the fulfillment of <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> <b>tasks.</b> Those competencies were then grouped into a model of four training units.

A subgroup of participants also completed discussions about their feelings surrounding the topic of teacher stress.

In {{this study}} the writer {{assumed that the}} psycho-social {{characteristics}} of physically disabled patients would influence the <b>role</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> of the medical social worker at the Rehabilitation Clinic. Therefore {{an attempt was made}} to determine the psycho-social characteristics of patients referred to the Rehabilitation Clinic. Furthermore an attempt was made to determine the <b>role</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> of the medical social worker in relation to these psycho-social characteristics. The research method was a descriptive one, using archival data; the latter being social work records of interviews with patients. Prior to the research a literature study was done on various aspects of physical disability and vocational rehabilitation. A sample group of 45 subjects was compiled by a random sampling technique. Two structured schedules were used to extract data from both the social work file and the Rehabilitation Clinic patient file. The research and processing of the information was done manually. The findings revealed the following 1. The majority of the physically disabled patients were Coloured males in the age category of 31 - 50 years. 2. These patients had poor educational qualifications and were previously unskilled or semi-skilled labourers. 3. The patients were unemployed and had no income. 4. These patients had a passive lifestyle with no hobbies or little religious involvement. They also habitually abused liquor and/or cannabis. 5. The housing conditions of these patients were inadequate and primitive. 6. The various roles of the medical social worker included those of rehabilitation counsellor, team member, co-ordinator/resource manager and teacher, whereas the tasks included assessment, dissemination of information, referrals, co-ordinating of services and education. The final conclusion in this study was that the <b>role</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> of medical social worker was influenced by both the psycho-social characteristics of referred patients as well as the expectations of the rehabilitation team of the Rehabilitation Clinic...|$|R
