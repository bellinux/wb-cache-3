40|$|A winch system {{provides}} {{a method for}} launch and recovery capabilities for kites and tethered blimps or balloons. Low power consumption is a key objective, as well as low weight for portability. This is accomplished by decoupling the tether-line storage and wind ing/ unwinding functions, and providing tailored and efficient mechanisms for each. The components of this system include rotational power input devices such as electric motors or other apparatus, line winding/unwinding <b>reel(s),</b> line <b>storage</b> <b>reel(s),</b> and independent drive trains. Power {{is applied to the}} wind/unwind reels to transport the tether line. Power is also applied to a line <b>storage</b> <b>reel,</b> from either the wind/unwind power source, the wind/unwind reel itself, or separate power source. The speeds of the two reels are synchronized, but not dependent on each other. This is accomplished via clutch mechanisms, variable transmissions, or independent motor controls. The speed of the <b>storage</b> <b>reel</b> is modulated as the effective diameter of the reel changes with line accumulation...|$|R

40|$|Umbilical is a {{hardware}} element {{that connects the}} subsea systems to the top side systems of a floating production unit. During its manufacture, storage and installation, sometimes it shows behaviour like snake as found {{in three of the}} Aker Solution s umbilical Agbami, Droshky and kipper in three different situations. An umbilical passes through many operations in the manufacturing plant like bundling, extrusion, reeling on and off the storage drum, transfer into installation vessel from <b>storage</b> <b>reel.</b> Different types of loading phenomenon may appear in these stages of operation. And from these loads even before being in the operation field, umbilical can experience different type of deformation in the manufacturing plant. Curvature is the main source of umbilical deformation in the manufacturing field. Curvature may introduce directly in the umbilical from operation loads of straightener, creeping or squeezing effect in tensioner. Curvature may also arise from internal friction and unbalanced bending moment which arises from design i. e. orientation, geometry and material property of the internal structural components. To find the solutions of avoiding different deformations at the different stages of the manufacturing plant and to ensure desire comfortable handling, it is necessary to predict their behaviours correctly at different loading conditions. Exact analytical and numerical modelling is needed to find and predict the exact behaviours. In this thesis work, number of modelling and simulations have been done in software USAP and BFLEX to investigate the reason of snaking behaviour of three umbilicals, occurred in the manufacturing plant of Aker Solutions. From the results of simulations it has found that umbilical Agbami experienced snaking when it was transferring from <b>storage</b> <b>reel</b> for installation work, due to having residual curvature from <b>storage</b> <b>reel,</b> gravity load and twisting rotation. The reason of residual curvature is creeping of its outersheath. Umbilical Droshky showed snaking deformation because of having residual curvature in its component steel tubes. And, in umbilical Kipper snaking deformation arose because of developing internal friction in it. In the different modelling of this work, PIPE 31 element is used for the modelling of umbilical core pipe or outersheath and to model the inside helix elements HELIX 231 element is used in USAP and HSHEAR 353 element in BFLEX. The contact between pipe and helix element in BFLEX is modelled by HCONT 453 element. The software USAP and BFLEX has showed convergence problem in some cases of modelling. Improvement is needed to overcome these problems...|$|R

50|$|After {{planning}} and training, Croker and crew {{set out for}} Turin. Mafia boss Altabani (Raf Vallone) and his underlings are waiting in the Alps at the same pass where they killed Beckermann. Altabani warns Croker that the Mafia {{are aware of the}} gang's intentions and smashes their Jaguar E-Type cars, sending Croker's personal Aston Martin DB4 drophead off a cliff. Croker tells Altabani that Mr. Bridger will avenge their deaths by attacking the Italian community in Britain. Altabani lets them go, ordering them to return to England. Instead, they proceed with the plan, replacing the traffic control system's magnetic tape data <b>storage</b> <b>reels.</b> On the day of the robbery, Croker sends gang member Birkinshaw, disguised as a football fan, to jam the closed circuit television cameras that monitor traffic. The substitute data reel then causes widespread traffic chaos. The gang converge on the gold convoy, overpower the guards, and tow the armoured car into the entrance hall of the Museo Egizio. There, the gang transfer the gold to the Minis.|$|R

40|$|The {{method and}} {{apparatus}} {{for measuring the}} number of layers of a web material of known thickness wound on a <b>storage</b> or take-up <b>reel</b> is presented. The method and apparatus {{are based on the}} principle that, at a relatively large radius, the loci of layers of a thin web wound on the reel approximate a family of concentric circles having radii respectively successively increasing by a length equal to the web thickness. Tachometer pulses are generated in response to linear movement of the web and reset pulses are generated in response to rotation of the reel. A digital circuit, responsive to the tachometer and reset pulses, generates data indicative of the layer number of any layer of the web and of position of the web within the layer without requiring numerical interpolation...|$|R

The study considers dipolar magnetic fields all sharing the same boundary flux distribution on the unit sphere and characterized with (1) a nonlinear distribution of its azimuthal field component expressed as a power of the poloidal flux function and (2) a plasma distribution varying linearly with the poloidal flux function. Nonlinear boundary value problems are solved numerically to generate a continuum of solutions with two parameters to control the total azimuthal flux {{and the strength of}} field-plasma interaction. The study includes the force-free fields of the first paper as a special case. Models with polytropic indices 7 / 6, 14 / 11 are treated to show the interplay between the degree of magnetic twist and hydrostatic stratification in determining atmospheric structures, with particular interests in magnetic flux <b>ropes</b> and their <b>storage</b> of magnetic energy and azimuthal flux at levels above those bounds applicable to force-free fields. The concluding discussion relates physical insights from the study to the solar corona and the energetics of coronal mass ejections and flares...|$|R

50|$|Reels, winders, line keepers, line baskets, line balls, heaping, bagging, boxingKite {{lines are}} stored in a mooring situation; a <b>storage</b> devices or <b>reels</b> {{become part of the}} mooring. When a human kite {{operator}} holds a reel, the kite line may be let out or wound back onto the reel; the kite operator is the mooring, yet the reel is part of the mooring situation; the reel and the reeling of the kite line has many parameters that make for successful kite operating. Similarly, the kite lines for large cargo-ship kite systems need to be carefully designed to hold and operate the kite lines; huge pressures on the reels require that reels be designed to fit the task. Kite lines may be damaged when improperly reeled; twist to the kite line may increase or decrease unwantedly when kite line let out and replaced on the reel incorrectly. The pattern of keeping the kite line on reel cores is given attention by kite operators. De-tensioning kite lines before storing on a reel is done when such is needed for safety and maintenance of kite line integrity. Avoiding excessive twist, burn, pressure accumulation, cutting, tangles, knotting during mooring are important aspects of kite operating; injury and death have resulted from inadequate care for handling kite lines. Lines moored to control bars, masts, poles, stakes, anchors, reels, hooks, etc. mean that the mooring being operated needs to have such parts mechanically sustain integrity during kite operation. A chain is as strong as its weakest link; the mooring of a kite system requires the line holding mechanisms to be fully able to stay properly operating during all anticipated contingencies of flight sessions. Reels themselves are sometimes involved in special applications like generating electricity. When kiting hang glider for pay-out launching, timing of the reel's release of kite line is very important. Reels powered by scooters are kiting manned hang gliders off flatland.|$|R
