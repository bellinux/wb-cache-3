5|$|Although {{his work}} took him from Silverton, for the {{remainder}} of his life, Davenport was often melancholy for his native Oregon, and in writing to relatives there, he repeatedly told them not to send him anything that would <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of Silverton, because he would be plunged into despair.|$|E
5|$|The case {{attracted}} commentary by two contemporary writers. John of Salisbury, who was {{a secretary}} for Theobald, added information about Osbert {{in a letter to}} Alexander III on unrelated business. In the section of the letter, John pointed out to the pope that no matter what others might say about Osbert, he had failed to secure other clergy willing to swear that he was innocent. Another contemporary, Gilbert Foliot, who was Bishop of Hereford, wrote to the pope to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> that although Osbert's accuser had offered to prove his accusations by undergoing a trial by ordeal, this was essentially meaningless since canon law forbade the clergy from the ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Dark Gaia then attacks Sonic and Chip, but Chip protects Sonic {{and calls}} {{all of the}} Gaia temples {{together}} to form the Gaia Colossus and fight Dark Gaia. The Gaia Colussus seemingly destroys Dark Gaia, but Dark Gaia is not finished with them or the Earth yet, and consumes the entire world in darkness, becoming Perfect Dark Gaia in the process. Chip then gives the restored Chaos Emeralds to Sonic, allowing him to turn into Super Sonic and destroy it; Dark Gaia then sinks back into the planet, but the battle takes its toll on Super Sonic. Chip saves Sonic by throwing him to the surface, before returning himself {{to the inside of}} the planet; he leaves behind his necklace and some parting words. Sonic places the necklace on his hand as a bracelet to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of their adventure together before speeding off with Tails, flying alongside him on the coastline in the Tornado plane.|$|E
50|$|Finally, Uma tackles {{the raging}} {{conflict}} between Chidambaram and Ammaiyappan. She scans his expenses and <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> that costs are actually reduced when items are obtained in larger quantities. She also <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> that Ammaiyappan does not charge rent. She also <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> of his filial responsibilities. In the meantime, Kannamma reminds Ammaiyappan {{that his family}} is all he has, {{and that he should}} think of his children and grandchildren as his legacy and not his adversaries. Chidambaram and Ammaiyappan are finally reconciled.|$|R

5|$|The Bearded Man {{demands that}} Fassl kill Fain, beating him {{up when he}} doesn't comply. As she tends to Fassl, Fain first sees the Bearded Man in his place. While staking out Fain's house, the agents see the Bearded Man flee. Doggett pursues the Bearded Man while Reyes finds Fain alive. In the pursuit, Reyes falls through into a sewer, where she finds {{the remains of the}} Bearded Man's victims. After a {{struggle}} with the Bearded Man who is holding Doggett at knife point, Reyes shoots. The Bearded Man falls into the water and Doggett goes after him, only to pull up Fassl, much to his confusion. Reyes tries to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> that it does not matter as long as the case is solved.|$|E
5|$|Todd was {{initially}} a short-term villain, but his popularity {{with the audience}} and critics inspired the writers to forgo killing him or permanently sending him to prison, like most soap operas had done with rapists in the past. While keeping aspects of his personality dark or violent, they had Todd exhibit a conscience and compassion. They took steps to redeem him and made him {{an integral part of}} OLTL canvas, despite Howarth's objections to a redemption storyline. With the use of literary techniques for the redemptive arc, the writers borrowed from nineteenth-century melodrama and Gothic traditions, and literature such as Frankenstein. Todd became the product of an affair between his father, Victor Lord, and his mother, Irene Manning, which provided him a fortune and ties to other major characters, including his sisters, Tina and Victoria Lord. An important aspect of the character became his appearance, most notably the scar on his right cheek, which emerged as synonymous with him and served to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of his past misdeeds against Marty. Music and the use of humor were also key to Todd's development. Although he formed many relationships (including with his wives, Blair Cramer and Téa Delgado), and fathered children, a defining characteristic of his personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy.|$|E
5|$|With only 30 minutes {{remaining}} {{before the}} ship is destroyed, Kirk considers transporting the entire crew to Caliban so they can survive. Scotty discovers Sulu's original transporter pattern, from when the warbird was destroyed. He theorizes that he could re-integrate it into the older version, resetting his memories {{so that he could}} remember the Romulan information and allowing him to pilot the Enterprise to safety but causing him to forget his 30 years on Caliban. Alana reassures him that she'll <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of the man he became, but McCoy and Spock agree that leaving the rift will cause the death of Alana. Sulu draws his sword and is prepared to fight to save his daughter, but she talks him down. He strides onto the transporter pad and demands they reintegrate his pattern. As he is merged once again, Alana quotes The Tempest. The younger version of Sulu is taken to the bridge and pilots the Enterprise from the anomaly with seconds to spare, with Alana ceasing to exist as he does so. Back on the Excelsior, Captain Sulu meets with the shuttle passengers in his ready room; his daughter Demora (Mimi Chong) and is introduced to his baby granddaughter, Alana.|$|E

5|$|As the Enterprise arrives, {{the crew}} members explore the offerings of Farpoint Station and {{establish}} relations with their Bandi host, Groppler Zorn (Michael Bell). The crew becomes suspicious when items they desire seem to appear out of nowhere moments later, and are unable to identify the power source that feeds the station. Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), an empath, senses a being with powerful yet despairing emotions nearby, and the crew discover a strange labyrinth beneath the station, but Zorn does not offer an explanation. As the Enterprise crew continues its explorations, a large unknown alien craft enters orbit and begins to fire upon an older Bandi settlement near Farpoint Station, and abducts Zorn. Before Picard orders the ship's phasers to be fired at the craft, Q appears to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of humanity's trial and prompts Picard to send an away team to the alien craft. The away team discovers the craft has passages similar to those under Farpoint and {{they are able to}} free Zorn. Their actions cause the alien craft to transform into a jellyfish-like space creature, and Picard is able to deduce the mystery of Farpoint Station. He confirms with the apologetic Zorn that the Bandi found a similar lifeform injured on their planet and, while attempting to care for it, they also exploited its ability to synthesize matter to create Farpoint Station. The creature now in orbit is trying to help free its mate by attacking those who hold it captive.|$|E
5|$|Stewie rams a toy {{spaceship}} into Peter's ear, annoying him, so Peter throws Rupert {{into the}} basement. Stewie follows the bear, discovering an old television script that Brian wrote entitled What I Learned on Jefferson Street. Stewie tosses the script onto the kitchen table, prompting Lois to question {{what it is}} about. Brian suggests she read it and tell him what she thinks. Lois {{falls in love with}} it, and suggests he meet with network executives about producing the show. When Brian pitches it to CBS, the executives respond positively. While the initial casting session goes well, with Elijah Wood auditioning for the lead, the producers assigned by the executives also bring in James Woods, who performs the role in a more comedic fashion, winning over the executives. Brian's serious drama is turned into a sitcom, bringing in a live studio audience as well as a chimpanzee, and renaming it Class Holes. When Brian objects to the changes, the producers <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of what he had tried to achieve for many years—his own television show—and threaten him with unemployment if he objects to those changes. Disappointed that Brian allowed the executives to change his show so dramatically, Lois demands that he stand up for himself and object to everything James Woods changed about the show. The producers, however, do not take kindly to Brian's desire to start over, so Brian quits in frustration. Brian reveals his disappointment that he no longer has his own television show, but Lois convinces him that it is his integrity that matters. Peter interrupts, with his own show appearing on the screen, entitled Bigger Jaws.|$|E
25|$|During the {{leadership}} election, Lamont clashed angrily in private with Nigel Lawson who preferred Michael Heseltine as Thatcher's successor, phoning Lawson up to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of his caustic remarks made about Heseltine's economic policies.

25|$|After Lai Min's {{string of}} incidents, the Shu {{government}} specially appointed him as General Who Behaves Cautiously (執慎將軍).

25|$|San Francisco stormed back, driving 70 {{yards in}} seven plays on a drive that {{consumed}} only 2:24 {{and ended with}} Garcia's 26-yard touchdown pass to Owens. Owens added a 2-point conversion catch on the next play, cutting the 49ers deficit to 38–22. After the play, an iconic scene of defensive lineman Michael Strahan walking over to Owens and pointing to the scoreboard to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of the deficit they still faced would be a highlight of the game.|$|E
25|$|Despard has atoned for his {{previous}} {{ten years of}} evil acts and has married Mad Margaret. The two of them now live a calm, dispassionate life of moderately-paid public service. They come to the castle and urge Robin to renounce his life of crime. When Robin asserts {{that he has done}} no wrong yet, they <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> that he is morally responsible for all the crimes Despard had done in his stead. Realising the extent of his guilt, Robin resolves to defy his ancestors.|$|E

25|$|Hnæf and his unnamed nephew, said {{also to be}} Hildeburh's son, {{are placed}} on a funeral pyre. After this most of the Danish warriors leave, but Hengest and {{probably}} some of the Danes stay throughout winter. Eventually a figure {{referred to as the}} son of Hunlaf places a sword on Hengest's lap to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of his loyalties. Other Danes also return, and probably together they wreak havoc on the Frisians and slay king Finn. The Danes take the unnamed Frisian queen back to what appear to be her own people in Denmark, identifying the Frisian queen as probably Danish.|$|E
25|$|Wakka {{lost his}} younger brother Chappu to Sin {{a year before the}} events of Final Fantasy X, and he never fully {{recovered}} from it. He forms a close brotherly relationship with Tidus, partially fueled by his resemblance to Chappu, though Lulu constantly has to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> that Tidus is not Chappu. As a devout follower of Yevon's teachings, Wakka believes that anyone who does not believe in Yevon, like the Al Bhed, are evil heathens, and is staunchly against the use of machina. However, he begins to question both his faith by the time Yevon's true colors are exposed to the world. Near the game's ending, Wakka denounces his prior beliefs entirely.|$|E
25|$|Following Sun Quan's {{death in}} May 252, the Grand Tutor Zhuge Ke, {{who had been}} {{appointed}} regent for Sun Quan's youngest son and successor, Sun Liang, proposed to the imperial court to move the nobles away from areas with a heavy military presence. He thus relocated Sun Fen from Wuchang to Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi). However, Sun Fen turned furious {{when he heard about}} it and refused to move out of Wuchang. Zhuge Ke wrote a long letter to Sun Fen to warn him about the perils of not knowing his place and to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of the downfall of his fourth brother, Sun Ba, the Prince of Lu.|$|E

At Granny’s, Mary Margaret, David, and Henry choose to spend their last hours alive, while Emma reveals her plan to Regina {{that she wants to}} sacrifice herself of the darkness inside. Gold then hands over Excalibur to Emma and arranges for Belle to escape town and live her life. Regina and Robin then confront Zelena again, only to have Regina use Merlin's Wand to conjure up a magic tornado to send Zelena to Oz, with Zelena vowing to return. Emma prepares her plan to confront Hook, who appears at her house, but he has the upper hand after he transforms into Henry, fooling her into handing over Excalibur, which leaves her defenseless.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the play, Walter and Beneatha's father has recently died, and Mama is waiting for a life insurance check for $10,000. Walter has a sense of entitlement to the money, but Mama has religious objections to alcohol and Beneatha has to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> it is Mama's call how to spend it. Eventually Mama puts some of the money down on a new house, choosing an all-white neighborhood over a black one for the practical reason that it happens to be much cheaper. Later she relents and gives {{the rest of the money}} to Walter to invest with the provision that he reserve $3,000 for Beneatha's education. Walter passes the money on to Willy's naive sidekick Bobo, who gives it to Willy, who absconds with it, depriving Walter and Beneatha of their dreams, though not the Youngers of their new home. Meanwhile, Karl Lindner, a white representative of the neighborhood they plan to move to, makes a generous offer to buy them out. He wishes to avoid neighborhood tensions over interracial population, which to the three women's horror Walter prepares to accept as a solution to their financial setback. Lena says that while money was something they try to work for, they should never take it if it was a person's way of telling them they weren't fit to walk the same earth as them.|$|E
25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E
