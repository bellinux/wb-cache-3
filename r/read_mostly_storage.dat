40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} which college students read, and then attempted to match, a series of written descriptive passages with the referent photographs on which they were based; the photographs sho wed {{the face of an}} actor, representing a variety of emotional expressions. In Experiment I, subjects provided with a series of context passages depicting a narrow range of emotions (neither pleasant nor unpleasant) chose “matches” having more extreme pleasantness values than did subjects provided with context passages depicting a wide range of descriptions on the pleasantness dimension when responding to test descriptions embedded within the context series. In Experiments II and III, contrast effects were obtained; subjects who had <b>read</b> <b>mostly</b> unpleasant context passages chose more pleasant referents in response to neutral test descriptions than did those who had <b>read</b> <b>mostly</b> pleasant descriptions. The results of all three experiments suggested that these effects were mediated in large part by a response bias, the tendency to use each response alternative with roughly equal frequency. In Experiments II and III, there was suggestive evidence for the possibility that a more central (or perceptual) mechanism may also have contributed to the observed results...|$|R

However, when Zeffirelli asked Rabbi Albert Friedlander to help him create Jesus' Bar Mitzvah scene, the latter replied that such ceremonies were practiced only from the 15th century. The director, however, insisted on including it, and Friedlander tried to teach child actor Lorenzo Monet to read a short portion of the Pentateuch in Hebrew. Monet, however, mumbled it and the director was not satisfied (in the film, boy Jesus <b>reads</b> <b>mostly</b> in English).|$|R

5000|$|The film is {{considered}} a loose remake of a 1968 film of the same name, but also draws influence from Mizuki Shigeru's GeGeGe no Kitarō manga series of the same name.

While these previous adaptations have been <b>read</b> <b>mostly</b> as nationalist narratives, with the native Yōkai driving out invading forces, The Great Yōkai War has been read instead for the clash between Japan's traditional landscape and its modern culture. This is largely due to the film's use of Kikai (機械, lit. [...] "machine monsters"), created by Katō fusing the Yōkai with machines, and the absence of invading Western or otherwise foreign forces.|$|R
