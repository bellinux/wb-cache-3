40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that pulmonary oxygen uptake is greater during cycle exercise in humans at high compared to low contraction frequencies. However, {{it is unclear whether}} this is due to more work being performed at the high frequencies and whether the energy turnover of the working muscles is higher. The present study tested the hypothesis that human skeletal muscle oxygen uptake and energy turnover are elevated during exercise at high compared to low contraction frequency when the total power output is the same. Seven subjects performed single-leg dynamic knee-extensor exercise for 10 min at contraction frequencies of 60 and 100 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> where the total power output (comprising the sum of external and internal power output) was matched between frequencies (54 ± 5 vs. 56 ± 5 W; mean ± s. e. m.). Muscle oxygen uptake was determined from measurements of thigh blood flow and femoral arterial–venous differences for oxygen content (a–v O 2 diff). Anaerobic energy turnover was estimated from measurements of lactate release and muscle lactate accumulation as well as muscle ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) utilisation based on analysis of muscle biopsies obtained before and after each exercise bout. Whilst a–v O 2 diff was the same between contraction frequencies during exercise, thigh blood flow was higher (P < 0. 05) at 100 compared to 60 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> Thus, muscle V̇O 2 was higher (P < 0. 05) during exercise at 100 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> Muscle V̇O 2 increased (P < 0. 05) by 0. 06 ± 0. 03 (12 %) and 0. 09 ± 0. 03 l min− 1 (14 %) from the third minute to the end of exercise at 60 and 100 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.,</b> respectively, but {{there was no difference between}} the two frequencies. Muscle PCr decreased by 8. 1 ± 1. 7 and 9. 1 ± 2. 0 mmol (kg wet wt) − 1, and muscle lactate increased to 6. 8 ± 2. 1 and 9. 8 ± 2. 5 mmol (kg wet wt) − 1 during exercise at 60 and 100 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.,</b> respectively. The total release of lactate during exercise was 48. 7 ± 8. 8 and 64. 3 ± 10. 6 mmol at 60 and 100 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> (not significant, NS). The total anaerobic ATP production was 47 ± 8 and 61 ± 12 mmol kg− 1, respectively (NS). Muscle temperature increased (P < 0. 05) from 35. 8 ± 0. 3 to 38. 2 ± 0. 2 °C at 60 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> and from 35. 9 ± 0. 3 to 38. 4 ± 0. 3 °C at 100 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> Between 1 and 7 min muscle temperature was higher (P < 0. 05) at 100 compared to 60 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> The estimated mean rate of energy turnover during exercise was higher (P < 0. 05) at 100 compared to 60 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> (238 ± 16 vs. 194 ± 11 J s− 1). Thus, mechanical efficiency was lower (P < 0. 05) at 100 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> (24 ± 2 %) compared to 60 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> (28 ± 3 %).

40|$|Mixing effects {{produced}} by ultrasonics in a flow process have been {{compared with the}} mixing obtained by a propeller stirrer at different speeds. These {{studies were carried out}} in an ultrasonic tank coupled with an ultrasonic generator. The generator produced sound waves at 90 kc. /sec. at an average output of 80 watts. Stimulus response technique was used to measure the residence time distributions. Water was allowed to flow through the tank at flow rates of 56, 125, 188, 250 and 320 ml. /min. Residence time distributions were measured for each flow rate at the following five conditions: 1) zero <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> 2) ultrasonic mixing 3) with stirrer at 200 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> 4) stirrer at 265 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> 5) stirrer at 1800 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> A slug of sodium hydroxide solution was used as a tracer and the tracer output was measured by a pH meter. A comparison of the residence times thus obtained gave a relative idea of the degrees of mixing obtained for various experiments. For {{a better understanding of the}} mixing taking place in the vessel under different experimental conditions, a model was proposed for the various exit age distribution curves obtained experimentally. The new model was compared with the models proposed by Levenspiel, and Bischoff and McCracken. It was found to predict better the curves for stirrer mixing. However, the curves obtained at zero <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> and with ultrasonic mixing were predicted slightly better by Bischoff and McCrackens' model. All these models had dead space and bypass flow as common parameters. The amounts of dead space and bypass flow at the flow rate 250 ml. /min. were as follows: 1) zero <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> dead space 20 per cent; bypass flow 20 per cent 2) ultrasonic mixing dead space 4. 6 per cent; Bypass flow 5 per cent 3) propeller at 200 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> Dead space 5 per cent; Bypass flow 5 per cent 4) propeller at 265 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> Dead space 3 per cent; Bypass flow 3 per cent 5) propeller at 1800 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> Dead space 1 per cent; Bypass flow 1 per cent Thus, as expected, the mixing obtained with ultrasonics was better than that at zero <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> It is comparable with the mixing obtained at 200 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> Also, the amounts of dead silence and bypass flow decreased as the intensity of mixing increased. From the mean residence times obtained with ultrasonic mixing, an index has been developed to estimate the degree of mixing {{produced by}} ultrasonics in equivalent <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> for a given flow. This index has been named "Sonomixing number". The results show that sonomixing number is significantly affected by the flow rate. As the flow rate decreases, the sonomixing number increases. It is postulated that the sonomixing number may be related to the ultrasonic intensity. Finally a correlation is developed for the mean residence time in terms of the sonomixing number. It should be noted that the results reported in this thesis are applicable under the limitations of the present experiemental setup, namely, the mixing vessel geometry, the flow inlet and outlet positions, the stirrer shape and size, and the present ultrasonic intensity and frequency...|$|E

40|$|In {{replying}} to Professor Gould and Professor Yamey, I must necessarily {{assume that}} the reader is generally familiar with the main outlines of my previous article. It may be useful, nevertheless, to restate the core of my argument very briefly. In the previous article, I urged the legality of certain types of price fixing and market division, both horizontal and vertical. Professors Gould and Yamey are concerned here only with one aspect of that article 2 ̆ 7 s thesis: my assertion that vertical price fixing or resale price maintenance, {{when it is not}} used as the tool of a cartel among resellers or among manufacturers, can only result from the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s desire to increase efficiency, and, further, that courts should accept that motivation as conclusive of the effect of such resale price maintenance. (Hereafter, unless otherwise indicated, references to resale price maintenance, or <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.,</b> should be taken to indicate only this variety of manufacturer-desired <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.)</b> In its briefest terms, my argument runs as follows: No manufacturer will desire <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> for the mere purpose of giving his resellers a greater-than-competitive return. The extra return would be money {{out of his pocket and}} we may safely assume that manufacturers are rarely moved to engage in that variety of philanthropy. The manufacturer who imposes <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.,</b> therefore, must be attempting to purchase something for it. What he gets is usually increased activity by the reseller in providing information, promotional services, and the like. These are means of increasing distributive efficiency and should be permitted on grounds of efficient resource allocation. The case is no different than if the manufacturer owned the resellers and required his reseller employees to perform the same functions. <b>R.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> is simply a partial integration and is often more efficient than full integration by ownership or contract...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of tests of a Power plus supercharger and a comparison of its performance with the performance previously obtained with an N. A. C. A. Roots-type supercharger. The Powerplus supercharger is a positive displacement blower of the vane type having mechanically operated vanes, the movement of which is controlled by slots and eccentrics. The supercharger was tested at a range of pressure differences from 0 to 15 inches of mercury and at speeds from 500 to 2, 500 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> The pressure difference across the supercharger was obtained by throttling the intake of a depression tank which was interposed in the air duct between the supercharger and the Durley orifice box used for measuring the air. The results of these tests show that at low pressure differences and at all speeds the power required by the Powerplus supercharger to compress a definite quantity of air per second is considerably higher than that required by the Roots. At pressure differences from 10 to 14 inches of mercury and at speeds over 2, 000 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> the power requirements of the two superchargers are practically the same. At a pressure difference of 15 inches of mercury or greater and at a speed of 2, 500 <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> or greater the performance of the Powerplus supercharger is slightly better than that of the Roots.

40|$|Although the {{application}} of a ring cowl to an airplane with an air-cooled engine increases the maximum L/D and the high speed to an appreciable extent, the performance in climb and ceiling is not increased as much as one would expect without analyzing the conditions. When a ring cowl is installed on an airplane, the propeller is set at a higher pitch to allow the engine to turn its rated <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> at the increased high speed. V/nD is increased and the propeller efficiency at high speed is increased slightly. The ratio of <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> at climbing speed, V(sub c), to the <b>r.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> at maximum speed, V (sub m) is dependent upon the ratio of V(sub c) to V(sub m).
