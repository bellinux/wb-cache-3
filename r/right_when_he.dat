5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment <b>right</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

His plan was to attack the hill from the north on the Quaker Road, using the divisions of Stonewall Jackson, Richard S. Ewell, D.H. Hill, and Brig. Gen. William H.C. Whiting. Magruder was ordered to follow Jackson and deploy to his <b>right</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> reached the battlefield. Huger's division was to follow as well, but Lee reserved the right to position him based on developments. The divisions of Longstreet and A.P.

25|$|In September 2013, Roxy, Jack and Kat are {{notified}} that Ronnie {{is being}} released from prison. Roxy wants to meet her but Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), Tommy's stepfather, who Roxy is now engaged to, protests. Kat goes instead and brings Ronnie back to Albert Square. Alfie insists Ronnie keep her distance, when he finds the sisters reminiscing with Tommy, nearby. As a result, Roxy cuts ties with Ronnie and spends time healing things with Alfie, away from the Square. During this time, Ronnie reconciles with Jack, {{but when it comes}} to going public, Jack cannot do it and decides to leave Walford. Ronnie's cousin, Phil, puts Ronnie in charge of his businesses, while he recovers from a car accident. She makes an enemy in Carl White (Daniel Coonan), when he attempts to muscle in on the businesses. When Roxy returns to the Square, she and Ronnie make peace but Ronnie becomes suspicious about Alfie's feelings for Kat. She is proved <b>right</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> leaves Roxy just after their wedding ceremony. Roxy then starts dating Carl and when Ronnie fails to pull her back together, she convinces Phil to sell The Queen Vic, the pub that Kat and Alfie lease from him, to force them out of Walford. However, Roxy continues to see Carl and Ronnie decides to take Roxy and Amy to Ibiza. When Carl learns about this, he threatens to rape Ronnie and, when he attacks her, she kills him in self-defence by slamming the boot of the car onto his head. She and Roxy then leave for Ibiza, after disposing of the body and only Phil is aware of her actions.|$|E

[...] On the basis of testimony from Robert M. Carter and the arguments put forth by the claimant's lawyers, the judge also pointed to nine [...] "errors", i.e. statements the truth of which he did not rule on, but that he found to depart from the mainstream scientific positions on global warming. He also found that some of these departures from the mainstream arose in the context of alarmism and exaggeration in support of political theses. Since the government had already accepted to amend the guidance notes to address these along with other points in a fashion that the judge found satisfactory, no order was made on the application.|$|E

But then, for me it assumed an enormous level of responsibility to the people I met, to the issue, to the community." [...] He met thousands of people, but only a few agreed to appear in the film, as most were too frightened of being expelled from their community. Even when interviewing those who did agree to appear, DuBowski had to hide his film equipment so their neighbors would not know that they had agreed to take part. As a result, the documentary took six years to complete.|$|E
500|$|It is {{believed}} that Grace contemplated retirement from cricket {{in the winter of}} 1877–78. He had been seriously injured in a shooting accident in September 1877, which nearly cost him the sight of one eye, and this may have caused him to review his life. Still unqualified as a doctor and with a growing family to support, Grace had doubts about his long-term security even though he was making considerable profit from cricket by way of [...] "grossly inflated" [...] expense claims and appearance fees. Unexpectedly, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) solved his financial problems by voting him a National Testimonial with a view to purchasing a medical practice out of the proceeds. It was hoped that a regular income would [...] "end the embarrassment of his blatant shamateurism". One of Grace's biographers, Bernard Darwin, who knew him personally, wrote that the arrival of the first Australian touring team [...] "tipped the beam in favour of cricket" [...] but it was also the case that no one, especially Grace, took the Australian players too seriously. It is more likely that A. J. Webbe was <b>right</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> said: [...] "W. G. never could have given up cricket".|$|E
500|$|In November 1948, {{the family}} moved to Memphis, Tennessee. After {{residing}} for nearly a year in rooming houses, they were granted a two-bedroom apartment in the public housing complex known as the Lauderdale Courts. Enrolled at L. C. Humes High School, Presley received only a C in music in eighth grade. When his music teacher informed him {{that he did not have}} an aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit, [...] "Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me", in an effort to prove otherwise. A classmate later recalled that the teacher [...] "agreed that Elvis was <b>right</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> said that she didn't appreciate his kind of singing." [...] He was usually too shy to perform openly, and was occasionally bullied by classmates who viewed him as a [...] "mama's boy". In 1950, he regularly began practicing guitar under the tutelage of Jesse Lee Denson, a neighbor two-and-a-half years his senior. They and three other boys—including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnette—formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the Courts. That September, he began ushering at Loew's State Theater. Other jobs followed, including Precision Tool, Loew's again, and MARL Metal Products.|$|E

500|$|On race day California Chrome did {{not break}} boldly. Espinoza later {{explained}} something felt [...] "off" [...] and he held the horse back a bit {{instead of going to}} the lead. When asked to move to the front, the horse did not unleash his usual burst of speed. Immediately following the race, Espinoza said [...] "He was just a little bit empty today". [...] Tonalist won the race, and California Chrome finished fourth in a dead heat with Wicked Strong. [...] Initial post-race analysts criticized Espinoza for not taking the horse to the front early on, but noticed that California Chrome had had some blood on his right front heel. After the race, review of photos taken at the start showed that the horse next to him, Matterhorn, moved too far to the left and stepped on California Chrome's heel as both horses broke from the gate. [...] As a result, California Chrome had run the race with a [...] "chunk" [...] of tissue taken out of his right front heel and a small cut on his tendon. The tendon injury was superficial, but the heel injury may have been a factor in his loss. [...] Sherman explained that he knew that something was not <b>right</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> saw the horse throw his head up in the homestretch, and speculated later that the sand and dirt of the racetrack caused pain in the open wound. [...] The following day, Sherman assured the press that both injuries would heal.|$|E
500|$|A murderous and psychopathic {{criminal}} mastermind who portrays {{himself as}} an [...] "agent of chaos" [...] and rises to power by terrorizing Gotham and plunging it into anarchy. Before Ledger was confirmed for the role in July 2006, Paul Bettany, Lachy Hulme, Adrien Brody, Steve Carell, and Robin Williams publicly expressed interest in it. However, Nolan had {{wanted to work with}} Ledger on a number of projects in the past (including unsuccessfully approaching Ledger for the role of Batman in Batman Begins) and was agreeable to Ledger's chaotic interpretation of the character. When Ledger saw Batman Begins, he had realized a way to make the character work that was consistent with the film's tone: he described his Joker as a [...] "psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy." [...] In the film, the Joker has a Glasgow smile, and his trademark chalk-white skin and red lips are makeup rather than the result of chemical bleaching, as in the traditional portrayal of the character. Throughout the film, the Joker states his desire to upset social order through crime, and comes to define himself by his conflict with Batman. To prepare for the role, Ledger lived alone in a hotel room for a month, formulating the character's posture, voice, and personality, and kept a diary, in which he recorded the Joker's thoughts and feelings. While he initially found it difficult, Ledger eventually generated a voice unlike Jack Nicholson's character in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film. He was also given [...] and , which he [...] "really tried to read and put it down." [...] Ledger also cited A Clockwork Orange and Sid Vicious as [...] "a very early starting point for Christian [...] and I. But we kind of flew far away from that pretty quickly and into another world altogether." [...] "There's a bit of everything in him. There's nothing that consistent," [...] Ledger said, and added, [...] "There are a few more surprises to him." [...] Ledger was allowed to shoot and mostly direct the videos the Joker sends out as warnings. Each take Ledger made was different from the last. Nolan was impressed enough with the first video shoot that he chose to not be present when Ledger shot the video with a kidnapped reporter (Anthony Michael Hall). On January 22, 2008, after he had completed filming The Dark Knight, Ledger died of an accidental prescription drug overdose, leading to intense press attention and memorial tributes. [...] "It was tremendously emotional, <b>right</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> passed, having to go back in and look at him every day ," [...] Nolan recalled. [...] "But the truth is, I feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish." [...] All of Ledger's scenes appear as he completed them in the filming; in editing the film, Nolan added no [...] "digital effects" [...] to alter Ledger's actual performance posthumously. Nolan has dedicated the film in part to Ledger's memory.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{foundation}} charter of Chester Abbey granted by his uncle Hugh Lupus, earl of Chester, and purportedly issued in 1093, Ranulf le Meschin {{is listed as}} a witness. His attestation to this grant is written Signum Ranulfi nepotis comitis, [...] "signature of Ranulf nephew of the earl". However, {{the editor of the}} Chester comital charters, Geoffrey Barraclough, thought this charter was forged in the period of Earl Ranulf II. Between 1098 and 1101 (probably in 1098) Ranulf became a major English landowner in his own <b>right</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> became the third husband of Lucy, heiress of the honour of Bolingbroke in Lincolnshire.

Tadić attended the signing of the SAA ceremony in Luxembourg on 29 April, where the Deputy Prime Minister Božidar Đelić signed the document on behalf of Serbia, as per the authorisation of the Government from December 2007. He was opposed by the then Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica who believed that Serbia ought not to sign any agreements with the European Union. While, on 1 May, Koštunica said that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was <b>right</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> said that the SAA should have been signed, he nonetheless vowed to annul the agreement after the parliamentary elections, calling it [...] "not in the service of Serbia's territorial integrity." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Naomi": Or rather [...] "No-o-mi." [...] The precise {{import of}} the word is not {{absolutely}} ascertained; but {{it is probable that}} it is somewhat abbreviated, and means [...] "God is sweet," [...] or, very literally, [...] "Jah is sweetness." [...] It had been originally imposed as a name by some grateful and happy mother, who, by gracious providences, or by other gracious revelations, had been led to think that [...] "sweet are the ways, sweet are the dealings, and sweet is the character of God." [...] The word does not mean [...] "beautiful", as some suppose; nor [...] "gracious", as others suppose; nor [...] "my delight", as others still suppose. It was not intended to describe the character of the person who was to bear the name. It was intended to signalize, in the spirit of a manifesto, a much-prized feature in the Divine character - that feature, namely, that is displayed when [...] "he deals sweetly with men." [...] Gesenius is doubtless <b>right</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> makes sweetness the fundamental idea of the whole group of affiliated words (see his 'Thesaurus,' in voc.). The cognate Hebrew adjective is rendered [...] "sweet" [...] in [...] and [...] (compare [...] and the margin of [...] ). In the light of this interpretation, and of it alone, can the full significance of what Naomi said on her return to Bethlehem be apprehended: [...] "Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me" [...] (verse 20).|$|E
