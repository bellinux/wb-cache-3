Reyerite {{is found}} in close {{association}} with gyrolite in the nletamorphic aureole of the volcanic plug of 'S Airde Beinn, northern Mull, and has apparently been formed by metamorphism of the gyrolite.

YROLITE and reyerite have been found closely associated in plateau basalts near the volcanic plug that forms the hill of 'S Airde Beinn, 3 miles west of Tobermory, Isle of Mull, Scotland. The gyrolite fills amygdales in the basalts just outside the aureole of the plug {{at the north end}} of the hill, and is seen as <b>radiating</b> <b>aggregates</b> of colourless plates of high birefringence associated with analcime, thomsonite, and natrolite. The reyerite is found a few yards away just within the metamorphic aureole of the plug. I t forms coarse pale-green <b>radiating</b> <b>aggregates</b> of plates of low birefringence filling amygdales and associated with the same zeolites as the gyrolite. The field relations indicate that it has been formed by mild metamorphism of the gyrolite, and it seems probable that this is also the origin of the reyerite of the type locality, at Niakornak in Greenland, where it {{is found in}} amygdales in blocks in a tuff pipe (Cornu, 1906; Boggild, 1908).

40|$|The Bearpaw Mountains, Montana, USA, {{form part}} of an Eocene high-K magmatic {{province}} on the northern margin of the Wyoming craton. Spinel dunite xenoliths from the Bearpaw Mountains contain evidence of interaction with a hydrous fluid with a subduction-related signature. These xenoliths fall into three categories. In Category 1, the rock {{has been subjected to}} moderate in situ serpentinization with antigorite appearing along olivine grain boundaries and forming reaction pockets through the breakdown of pyroxene, amphibole and spinel. In Category 2, newly formed clinopyroxene, amphibole, mica and calcite overprint and partially replace the antigorite in reaction pockets. In Category 3, metasomatic fibrous orthopyroxene appears at the expense of olivine in veins and in reaction pockets and sometimes forms spherulitic or <b>radiating</b> <b>aggregates.</b> The xenoliths have high B, Cl and H 2 O contents, and also whole-rock and mineral trace element patterns characteristic of subduction zones.

Spinel dunite xenoliths may have originated from the topmost part of the mantle lithosphere below the abnormally thick crust of the Wyoming craton. Hydrous fluids rising through the mantle lithosphere, but unable to penetrate the thick mafic-underplated crust, may have accumulated beneath the Moho, causing this topmost part of the mantle to become hydrated and initiating serpentinization.

Thus the tourmaline formed subsequently after burial under the sedimentary pile, probably during the Caledonian orogeny, when temperatures were high enough to allow its formation at suitable sites of nucleation, e. g. adjacent to biotite. Its peculiarity as a palaeosol phase is due to the combination of a marine transgression over an exposed, permeable illitic soil and underlying regolith, followed by increase in temperature suffcient to allow the tourmaline to form...|$|R

40|$|The {{south-western}} {{area of the}} Mt. Etna volcano {{has been}} studied because the presence of peculiar mineralogical association. In our previous study we investigated the Biancavilla area, a dome and dyke system with autobrecciated portion. In the Biancavilla volcanic system the metasomatic process {{led to the formation}} of new minerals, fluoro-edenite and fluoroflogopite [1] [2], and some rare minerals, such as pseudobrookite and As-apatite(Ca, F) (under study). In this work we studied the Santa Maria di Licodia area, a dome located on the East side of the Biancavilla volcanic area. Some significant differences are present respect to the Biancavilla, such as the presence of a fibrous orthopyroxene instead of fibrous fluoro-edenite. Fibrous orthopyroxene is rare, and was found in ultramafic xenoliths and interpreted as an autometasomatic product of hydrous magmas [3]. With the aim to investigate a possible metasomatic process in S. Maria di Licodia area, a detailed sampling was performed, and the sampling was executed on both the unaltered lava portion (massive rocks) and altered portion (massive and brecciated rocks) of the dome. Combining mineralogical and petrographic data the presence of fibrous orthopyroxene in both massive and brecciated portion was evidenced. Besides the fibrous opx, the secondary mineral phases also include alkali-feldspars (Na), augitic clinopyroxene, apatite, Fe-Ti oxides. Orthopyroxene show different morphology, such as prismatic, acicular and fibrous. In the massive rocks, fibrous orthopyroxene appears at the expense of probable olivine, in veins and in reaction rim. Here the orthopyroxene forms <b>radiating</b> <b>aggregates</b> totally replacing the previous crystal. The acicular morphology is only present in the pores of the rocks. Finally, in the brecciated portions the orthopyroxene is characterized by loose fibers. Different morphology correspond to differences in composition, in particular in the iron content. The EMPA analyses on the orthopyroxene form the massive rocks evidenced high content of FeO (until 18 wt%), while SEM-EDS micro-analyses on the fibers of the brecciated portion highlighted a more large variability, ranging from 4 to 14 wt % FeO. X-ray investigation on brecciated (fine) portion allowed to individuate and identify the orthopyroxene as an enstatite ferroan, also confirmed by the micro-analyses. [1]Gianfagna A., Oberti R.

It can be distinguished by its random orientation on the TEM grid (i. e., absence of preferential parting), the higher resistance under the electron beam, and different cell parameters and structure, whereas the composition is similar (Bi/S ~ 2. 2 / 1), apart {{for the presence of}} tellurium up to ~ 6 cations percents. The unit cell is hexagonal, space group P 62 c, a = 9. 5 (2) and c = 15. 4 (3) Å. In this case, a structure model was obtained ab initio from electron diffraction data. Interestingly, the mineral has a porous structure with one dimensional porosity (diameter of the channel ~ 7 Å). Finally, within the same centimeter sized hand-specimens, we detected also cannonite. Its identification was done by automatic diffraction tomography. The measured cell parameters are a = 7. 7 (2), b = 13. 9 (3), c = 5. 7 (1) Å, β = 109. 8 (5) °, the space group P 21 /c.

40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the {{contribution}} of platelet-dependent thrombin formation in haemostasis and thrombosis, we investigated under flow conditions the haemostatic functions of platelets from a patient with Scott syndrome. Scott platelets are characterised by a diminished platelet-dependent thrombin generation. Thrombin generation was determined by calibrated automated thrombography and flow-based experiments were performed to reveal collagen-mediated platelet activation and fibrin deposition. Our studies indicate that adherent Scott platelets do not differ from control platelets {{in the formation of}} stable platelet aggregates under static and flow conditions. While for adherent control platelets a shape change, e. g. balloon formation, and externalisation of phosphatidylserine (PS) is associated with an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, {{this is not the case}} for Scott platelets. The calcium-induced morphological changes in control platelets are accompanied with a diminished recruitment of free flowing platelets. Scott platelets, not showing a calcium-induced shape change, also lost the ability to recruit free flowing platelets. These findings rebut the hypothesis that the mild bleeding tendency of Scott syndrome patients is due to a preserved adhesive activity of patient’s platelets. Perfusion of tissue factor (TF) -activated control blood over immobilised collagen results in the formation of fibrin fibers that <b>radiate</b> from platelet <b>aggregates.</b> Although platelet aggregates were also observed after perfusion with TF-activated Scott blood, fibrin deposition was not observed. In conclusion, our findings indicate that platelet adhesion and spreading on a collagen matrix in the absence of fibrin formation is sufficient to sustain haemostasis under non-traumatic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We have {{investigated}} scattering properties of aggregates, emphasizing {{the size of}} constituent monomers comparable with the wavelength of visible light, in order to model the scattering properties of cometary dust. This has differentiated our study from previous investigations of aggregates in which {{the size of the}} monomers was much smaller than the wavelength. For aggregates, the absorption cross sections tend to have less steep slopes towards longer wavelength than a single sphere, typically, Cabs ∼ λ − 1. Consequently aggregates of absorbing material are cooler than the individual monomers, because the <b>aggregates</b> <b>radiate</b> more efficiently in the infrared. The polarization is sensitive to the shape and size of the constituent monomers {{as well as to the}} fine structure of the aggregate. Generally aggregates of highly absorbing material produce strong positive polarization around θp = 90 ◦, but no negative polarization near the backward direction. In contrast, silicate aggregates are the major source of strong negative polarization at larger scattering angles. A mixture of both carbonaceous and silicate aggregates results in a polarization curve which largely matches the observed negative polarization at θp ≤ 20 ◦ and the maximum peak around θp = 90 ◦ for cometary dust. The same mixture also gives a reasonable rise of the phase function toward the backward direction, which is similar to the phase function of cometary dust. Thus, we find that aggregates with constituent monomers a few tenths of a micron in size and with intermediate porosity (≈ 0. 6), similar to chondritic aggregate interplanetary dust particles, are a reasonable analog for cometary dust.

It occurs as <b>radiating</b> fibrous <b>aggregates</b> reaching 5 mm in diameter, constituted by acicular crystals associated with calcite, K-feldspar and chlorite. Pumpellyite-(Al) is transparent to translucent and exhibits an emerald-green to white colour, sometimes with bluish tinges. The lustre is vitreous and the streak is colourless. The mineral is non-fluorescent, brittle, and shows a perfect { 100 } cleavage. The estimated Mobs hardness is 51 / 2, and the calculated density is 3. 24 g/cm(3).
