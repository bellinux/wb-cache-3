40|$|This study investigates copreneurship {{in rural}} tourism businesses. It explores the {{experiences}} of owners of <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>accommodation</b> businesses in New Zealand {{within the framework of}} copreneurship. It also examines roles within copreneurial rural tourism businesses and studies women’s experiences of entrepreneurship specifically. Copreneurs are couples who share ownership, commitment and responsibility for a business together (Barnett and Barnett, 1989) and these couples in business together (copreneurs) are one form of family business. To date there has not been any published discussion of the concept of copreneurship and tourism, which is remarkable, given that many tourism businesses are SMEs built around lifestyle and integration of life stakeholders such as family and partners. This dissertation represents the first attempt to study copreneurship within tourism entrepreneurship, and within a rural tourism environment specifically. It uses an interpretive approach as part of the study to give the participants a voice and to stress the methodological importance of reflexivity where the researcher is an insider to the study. Triangulation of data sources and methods, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques enables a rich understanding of copreneurial expectations, roles and responsibilities and of women’s experiences specifically. The method of the research is a postal survey of <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>accommodation</b> business owners complemented by in-depth interviews with women in copreneurial business relationships. This thesis concludes that the <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>accommodation</b> sector in New Zealand is characterised by lifestylers and copreneurs running their businesses as a ‘hobby’, with the main aim being ‘to meet people’ and that non-economic, lifestyle motivations are important stimuli to business formation. Specific analysis of women’s experiences of tourism production in copreneurial situations has shown that any perception of copreneurship as a tool for enabling women to become freed from traditional gender roles may not equal the reality. Women’s voices were able to come through in both the survey and the interview part of this research, revealing that a gendered ideology persists even through copreneurial relationships in rural tourism. The copreneurs in this study have strong and widely shared preconceptions of their roles as accommodation providers and as task managers in their households; role perceptions which appear to be largely invariant of the situation. Copreneurial couples appear to engage in running the accommodation business using traditional gender-based roles mirroring those found in the private home...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the impacts}} of environmental amenities associated with agricultural and silvicultural land use {{on the price of}} <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>accommodation</b> in Asturias (Spain). A hedonic price model that relates the price of rural accommodation to environmental amenities as well as equipment, services offered, and the locational characteristics of the accommodation is estimated. The rural accommodations in the study are the self-catering cottages, the intrinsic features of which promote the development of rural tourism sustainability. Geographic information systems (GIS) data are used to measure the location and the proximity to amenities of these self-catering cottages. The main results indicate that agricultural land use has an important impact on the price of accommodation in self-catering cottages. Specifically, a high percentage of grassland in the municipality where the self-catering cottage is sited has a positive effect on rental prices, while a high percentage of arable crops has the opposite effect. The analysis is interesting for decision-making in the context of environmental policies, land use conflict resolution, and rural tourism sustainability...|$|E

40|$|In many <b>rural</b> regions, <b>tourism</b> is {{accepted}} as {{a natural part of}} the socio-economic fabric juxtaposed with agriculture. It is clear that <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> is based on rural amenities; however, {{it is not clear how}} this relates to agriculture. Are these inter-relationships of mutual benefit, in the sense that while <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> provides the farmer with auxiliary funding to continue his/her agricultural activity, the latter is an important or even necessary component of <b>rural</b> <b>tourism?</b> Do active farms with <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> enjoy economies to scope and run their businesses more efficiently than firms with only a single activity?

40|$|In Greece, the {{development}} of <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> was slow compared {{to the rest of}} Europe and was based mainly on the use of initiatives and programmes designed to finance these investments. The aim of these programs was among other things, to create new job places and higher incomes for the residents of rural areas. This thesis explores the competitiveness and viability of <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> enterprises that were set up by funding programs and reviews the objectives of these programs. We studied all <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>accommodations</b> in Central Macedonia that were subsidized by a funding program. It was found that the lines that determine the competitiveness of <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> enterprises is the use of available resources, the competitive environment in which they operate and the human factor. The <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> enterprises have low effectiveness in terms of resources used, placing their viability in a precarious position. The most important factor in improving competitiveness of these enterprises is the entrepreneur himself and in particular its business profile that defines the his strategy and the way he sets his objectives. Ensuring the sustainability of <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> enterprises will depend on how quickly the entrepreneurs can cope with environmental changes and adapt their operations in order to operate effectively. The location of the enterprise and the available agrototourism resources are essential to the competitiveness of <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> enterprises and should be taken into account when designing financial programmes. <b>Rural</b> <b>tourism</b> enterprises can {{play a key role in}} {{the development}} and regeneration of rural areas, provided that they can meet the demands of modern business environment.

It examined roles within copreneurial rural tourism businesses and studied women’s experiences of entrepreneurship within the copreneurial environment. To do this, the study used a mixed method approach (a survey and in-depth interviews) to elicit information about copreneurs operating rural tourism businesses, and about how women experience copreneurship within rural tourism.

40|$|Tourism is {{considered}} one of the fastest growing industries, assuming a central role in the economy of many countries. Over the past years, new tourism products have been launched and existent ones have been adapted, such as rural tourism. The motivations for the demand of these services are aimed at revitalizing physical and psychic balance, under stress caused by modern lifestyles. The importance of rural tourism has been stressed in several studies. For instance, according to Dong, Wang, Morais and Brooks (2013) rural tourism has been frequently mentioned as an alternative form of economic development in rural areas. Other studies have emphasized that it significantly contributes to the gross national product, wealth creation, employment generation (Choong-Ki, Var & Blaine, 1996; Borooah, 1999) and to regional development (Dredge, 1999). In a more recent study, rural tourism {{is considered}} as a diversification strategy that serves as a catalyst for economic growth in remote communities (Rid, Ezeuduji & Pröbst-Haider, 2014). In the Portuguese case, there is a low profitability of rural tourism and, therefore, it is crucial to identify market segments to create appropriate marketing strategies in order to increase the profitability of rural tourism (Kastenholz, 2002). Despite the importance of better understanding what motivates tourists to choose rural tourism, studies focusing on rural tourism in Portugal have been limited (e. g. Kastenholz, Davis & Paul, 1999; Kastenholz, 2005; Almeida, Correia & Pimpão, 2014). Thus, the main aim of this study is to examine Portuguese tourists’ preferences when choosing <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>accommodation.</b> The findings are crucial to support marketing strategies and for rural tourism development in Portugal. This study begins with a literature review of earlier studies concerning rural tourism, followed by the research methodology. In the fourth part, the results are discussed and finally, in the conclusions, some strategies are suggested as well as limitations of the study are presented. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

This study used desk research and life story interviews of rural tourism entrepreneurs as qualitative research method to identify prevalent success influential factors. Further quantitative analysis was applied in order to measure the strength of influence of identified success factors. The primary data for the quantitative research was gathered using telephone questionnaire composed of 37 questions with 5 -points Likert scale. The data was analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) by SmartPLS 3. 1. 6. Results indicated that human capital, social capital, entrepreneurial personality and external business environment are predominant influential success factors. However, human capital has non-significant direct effect on success (p 0. 493) nonetheless the effect was indirect with high level of partial mediation through entrepreneurial personality as mediator (VAF 73 %). Personality of the entrepreneur, social capital and business environment have direct positive affect on entrepreneurial success (p 0. 001, 0. 003 and 0. 045 respectably). Personality also mediates the positive effect of social capital on entrepreneurial success (VAF 28 %). Opposite to the theory the data showed no interaction between social and human capital on the entrepreneurial success. This research suggests that <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>accommodation</b> entrepreneurs could be more successful if there is increased support in development of social capital in form of conservation of cultural heritage and natural attractions.

No doubt, {{the basic structure}} and composition of agricultural landscape depends on local climatic and natural conditions. There is a close connection between agricultural landscape management and biodiversity management at the gene, species and habitat level. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present four ways to measure agricultural landscapes according to OECD landscape work and its definition of agricultural landscape context divided into themes of agricultural landscape structure, function and value. However, the main emphasis has been laid here on the Finnish agricultural landscape scale. It is proposed here that the structure of agricultural landscape is measured based on ecological value assessment and especially on the edge lengths of ditch boundaries that are located closest fields. Field margins are suggested to be of great importance to maintaining species diversity in the ordinary agricultural landscapes. Secondly, the functionality of agricultural landscape can be assessed considering the amount of open and managed cultivated areas. Maintaining the openness of agricultural landscapes is one of the targets of the Finnish Agri-Environmental Programme and also cultivating according to good local agricultural practices. In addition landscape values are becoming more and more important. Agricultural landscapes are places for food and fibre production but also areas for recreation and gaining rural experiences and other public commodities; amenity values of landscapes.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a {{typology}} of the organisational forms comprising the Australian condominium <b>tourism</b> <b>accommodation</b> sector. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 34 exploratory interviews were conducted with interviewees representing a cross-section of interests in condominium <b>tourism</b> <b>accommodation</b> operations. Findings - An original hierarchical typology is developed. The structuring criteria employed for the hierarchy include: whether a condominium complex is in a hotel or apartment complex, whether it is branded and whether the condominiums are serviced. Research limitations/implications - The findings reported will greatly advance the capacity to provide a meaningful commentary on the nature of condominium <b>tourism</b> <b>accommodation</b> complexes and to understand key issues associated with different forms of condominium <b>tourism</b> <b>accommodation</b> services provided. Practical limitations - The study suffers from the normal limitations associated with the subjective interpretation of qualitative data. In addition, the fast evolving nature of the condominium <b>tourism</b> <b>accommodation</b> sector signifies that the typology advanced should be viewed as somewhat time-specific.

40|$|In {{the last}} ten years Chilean governments have {{implemented}} various polices aimed at rural poverty alleviation, focusing initially only on agricultural development and more recently also on non-agricultural development, promoting activities such as <b>rural</b> <b>tourism.</b> While <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> has been developed in Chile to some extent, there is still a lack of empirical research on its development and impacts. The aim in doing this study was to overcome this lack of research and guide strategies for <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> development initiatives in Chile. To achieve this, a multiple case study involving two communities was undertaken to identify ways in which smallholder farming households can be assisted in diversifying their livelihoods into <b>rural</b> <b>tourism.</b> Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and participatory methods. These data were then analysed using qualitative methods. Households which have diversified into <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> are very positive about it. In economic terms <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> has allowed them to improve their housing conditions and increase spending on their children's education, and has provided work for women and young people. <b>Rural</b> <b>tourism</b> has also increased women's self-esteem and, importantly, has led people to place a higher value on their cultural traditions. It has also increased environmental awareness and fostered native tree planting at the household level. <b>Rural</b> <b>tourism</b> has also had some negative consequences, such as loss of family privacy, increased noise and increased solid waste problems. The main findings of this research suggest that there are key factors for successful <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> development. Therefore, for <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> to become a viable strategy for smallholder farming households assistance needs to take into account such things as provision of credit, technical assistance in setting up a <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> product to meet tourists' expectations, building stakeholders' capacity in <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> and business management, as well as assistance in establishing and managing an association of <b>rural</b> <b>tourism</b> providers.
