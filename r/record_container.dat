40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 54 - 55) Experimental {{measurements of}} the rate of escaping helium from the container {{as a function of}} time were made with a scale where weight readings were obtained continuously with a camcorder. Ten different vent tube diameters ranging from 0. 061 inches to 0. 500 inches, with the same container, were used as it was believed that if buoyancy effects were present, they might be dependent on the vent tube diameter and length. Since the scale can only <b>record</b> the <b>container</b> weight; an analysis was required to enable the differentiation between the masses of the helium and the air inside the container during the vent process. A diffusion model of the vent process was also developed to compare with the experimental data. The experimental data and the diffusion model both showed that the mass of helium inside the container decays exponentially with time. However, the measured rate of escape of helium in the early time period was found to be greater than that of the model, the difference becoming smaller as the vent tube diameter was increased in size. Since the measured and predicted weight measurements differences are greater than those due to experimental errors, the possibility of a presently unexplained buoyancy effect cannot be ruled out by this study. Nevertheless, the results still indicate that the emptying process is ultimately dominated by diffusion considering that the small container took anywhere from 3 hours to 2 days to empty...|$|R

Optimal resolution and sensitivity ranges for data extraction from this system were empirically determined, {{and found to}} be {{in close agreement with}} experimental results obtained by others. The high throughput methodology was utilized to identify genomic DNA polymorphisms in Fundulus heteroclitus, and quantitate the amount of gene flow occurring between populations. Subpopulations were sampled within two main populations located at Barn Island Marsh in Stonington, Connecticut, and on either bank of the Connecticut River in Old Lyme and Old Saybrook, Connecticut. The Barn Island subpopulations were sampled over two consecutive years. Fischer 2 ̆ 7 s exact test revealed the populations were genetically distinct, although the genetic distance separating them was low. Calculations of Weir and Cockerham 2 ̆ 7 s Theta P and theta S revealed {{that the majority of the}} variation occurred between subpopulations, with relatively little evident between populations. Nem was calculated from the theta values, resulting in values of ranging from 2. 0 to 9. 0. In all cases, Nem was greater than one, indicating sufficient gene flow to prevent differentiation by genetic drift. Little evidence of temporal stability was found, as the differentiation between populations sampled from Barn Island over two consecutive years was only slightly less divergent than comparison of either to the CT River populations. Detailed analysis of the CT River populations indicated that tidal flow had little, if any effect on gene flow. This pattern of high subpopulation divergence despite low overall difference between populations may indicate high seasonal mortality followed by extensive seasonal redistribution of the surviving genotypes.

30|$|Electrical load {{forecasting}} {{has become}} a significant evaluation tool for power consumers and producers. The importance of effective and accurate prediction models is to minimise utility risks and power costs and increase competitiveness. While {{there is a large}} quantity of load forecasting research, the RTG crane demand forecasting literature is more limited and complex compared to typical distribution loads. There are a number of challenges facing load forecasting of RTG cranes. These challenges can be attributed to three factors. First, there are no clear seasonality trends or pattern over the historical load data. Second, the outliers of the correlation between the exogenous variable and crane demand due to the human factor effect. Third, there is highly stochastic, volatile and non-smooth load behaviour especially for the low load values. In this research we have implement and tested a number of models to forecast the RTG crane day ahead load. After the RTG crane load series and the exogenous variables are analysed, we examine different options of forecast model inputs. Each model is trained separately using 21 days of data. To verify the prediction ability of the forecast models they are applied to two different cranes over three testing periods. The evaluation methods results of each model with different input variables discussed in this paper show that the ANN model (Model B 1) outperforms all other models. Although there are some extreme error peaks, the proposed Model B, Model C and Model D which exclude the estimation of both input variables achieved an acceptable level of prediction accuracy. Our results show that it is not recommended to estimate both exogenous variables in the models. Moreover, the prediction models achieve an acceptable performance when estimating only one exogenous variable with a more significant impact on forecast performance for the accurate container gross weight. This result is very encouraging for ports following the SOLAS requirements and <b>record</b> the <b>container</b> weight before moving them, which will help to forecast and understand the RTG crane demand.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Washington and Oregon became {{important}} {{states in}} the production of apples and pears in the early 1900 's. During these beginning stages, wooden boxes were used for shipping both apples and pears. Apple containerization has progressed through several stages. Today, the most common container for shipment of apples out of the Northwest is the tray-packed corrugated carton. Pear containerization, on the other hand, has changed only slightly. Presently, the container most commonly used for shipment of pears is a wooden box of approximately the same dimensions as its early predecessor. Improvements on the wooden box have been made, but basically the container has remained unchanged. In this study, the tray-packed apple carton and the wooden pear box are referred to as standard containers. These two standard containers will be compared to a five bushel, corrugated container, which will be referred to as a bulk bin. In evaluating the expenses which arise when packing fruit in bulk and standard containers, only the cost differentials were discussed. The major cost categories that were analyzed were: labor, materials, packing house commissions and overhead, and miscellaneous. Due {{to the nature of the}} packing house operations, only labor and material expenses gave rise to cost differentials. The cost differential in favor of bulk containers over standard containers was l. 4784 per 100 pounds of packed apples and 1. 2995 per 100 pounds of packed pears. In order to determine the shipping quality of bulk containers, three shipments of fruit packed in bulk containers were inspected. Two shipments of Anjou pears packed in standard and bulk containers were sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The third shipment was sent to Los Angeles, California and consisted of Red Delicious apples packed in bulk containers. In the pear shipments, three types of damage were recorded. These were: bruising, discoloration, and punctures or skin tears, In the apple shipment, only bruising and puncture damage were <b>recorded.</b> After the <b>containers</b> were inspected and the damages <b>recorded,</b> comparisons between <b>containers</b> were made. Using statistical methods, it was shown that there was no difference in total damage between the bulk and standard containers. In order to determine where the damage was occurring, the bulk containers were divided by height into three equal layers. Using this procedure, the damages occurring in the top, middle, and bottom layers could be identified and compared. Bruising was found to be most severe in the bottom layer. Discoloration and puncture damage was not affected by the layer treatment. From the information gathered in this study, it appears that two important observations can be made. First, the cost associated with 100 pounds of fruit can be substantially reduced by using bulk bins and second, the arrival condition of apples and pears packed in bulk containers will be about the same as fruit packed in standard containers...|$|R
