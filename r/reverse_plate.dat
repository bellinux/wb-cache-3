Once the pattern is plated and the Au seed has been removed via reverse plating, plasma etch is used to remove the field area TiW. Following plasma etch, defects were observed across the wafer surface. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) revealed that the defects were Au particles.

Although originally proposed to describe normal pulse plating, Yin has recently extended Ibl’s model to include pulse <b>reverse</b> <b>plating.</b> Using the expressions derived by Yin the pulse limiting current density was determined over a wide range of pulse plating conditions, and then compared to values calculated using more accurate numerical solutions. In general, there was good agreement between the two approaches which demonstrated the essential validity of Yin’s extension to Ibl’s original model. The simplified model is most accurate at long duty cycles, small dimensionless pulse times and for low values of the dimensionless pulse reverse current where its underlying assumptions {{are most likely to be}} valid. At very long dimensionless pulse times (i. e. T* > 1) the model becomes increasingly inaccurate and its use in these circumstances cannot be justified...|$|R

They oppose the current, therefore, in the first place, as interposed platina plates would do (1011-1018.); and to this they add a force of opposition as counter-voltaic plates.

Given the limited variety of <b>reversed</b> phase <b>plates,</b> mobile phase composition optimization is necessary to obtain better separation of analytes with similar characteristics, which is often a time consuming step. We present polarity-adjustable reversed phase ultrathin-layer chromatography (UTLC) plates, which simplifies the mobile phase screening process and greatly expands the selection of <b>reversed</b> phase <b>plates.</b> The plates were fabricated on glass substrates with SiO 2 nanopillars deposited using the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique. SiO 2 nanopillars were functionalized with octadecyltrichlorosilane to generate a super hydrophobic stationary phase. Unlike commercial silica-gel based stationary phases, the isolated nanopillar architecture presented here exposes a high surface area to post-fabrication surface treatments. In our work, an O 2 plasma treatment at different powers, pressures and exposure times was used to shorten the silane carbon chain and introduce COOH groups to the surface, producing plates with finely tunable polarities. Separation of a model dye mixture of Sudan blue and Sudan IV confirmed the tuning of surface polarities by measurement of retention behavior changes. The dye elution order reversed {{as a result of the}} change in surface polarity. When the same plasma treatment process was tested on commercial <b>reversed</b> phase <b>plates,</b> separation behavior did not change because the disordered and tortuous silica gel restricts the accessible surface area.

The rate determining step in one-step direct current is the charge transfer process. The increased supersaturated growth takes place over the same nucleation sites and hence results in the fine particles in porous/powdery deposits. Apart from DC depositions, there are other different plating techniques which includes pulse <b>plating,</b> pulse <b>reverse</b> <b>plating</b> and cyclic voltammetry techniques by which the secondary phase formation can be minimized [71, 113, 114]. Compared to conventional constant potential deposition techniques, electron charge transfer step is prevented in pulse plating as the deposition diffusion controlled process may lead thin films of large grain size morphology. Such deposition techniques are advantageous as we can have good control over the material composition.|$|R

40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} the cell–cell junction protein plakoglobin (PG) not only suppresses motility of keratinocytes in contact with each other, but also, unexpectedly, of single cells. Here we show that PG deficiency results in extracellular matrix (ECM) -dependent disruption of mature focal adhesions and cortical actin organization. Plating PG−/− cells onto ECM deposited by PG+/− cells partially restored normal cell morphology and inhibited PG−/− cell motility. In over 70 adhesion molecules whose expression we previously showed to be altered in PG−/− cells, a substantial decrease in fibronectin (FN) in PG−/− cells stood out. Re-introduction of PG into PG−/− cells restored FN expression, and keratinocyte motility was <b>reversed</b> by <b>plating</b> PG−/− cells onto FN. Somewhat surprisingly, based on previously reported roles for PG in regulating gene transcription, PG-null cells exhibited an increase, not a decrease, in FN promoter activity. Instead, PG was required for maintenance of FN mRNA stability. PG−/− cells exhibited an increase in activated Src, one of the kinases controlled by FN, a phenotype <b>reversed</b> by <b>plating</b> PG−/− cells on ECM deposited by PG+/− keratinocytes. PG−/− cells also exhibited Src-independent activation of the small GTPases Rac 1 and RhoA. Both Src and RhoA inhibition attenuated PG−/− keratinocyte motility. We propose a novel role for PG in regulating cell motility through distinct ECM–Src and RhoGTPase-dependent pathways, influenced in part by PG-dependent regulation of FN mRNA stability...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA new {{selective}} processing technique {{based on}} a confined dynamic liquid drop is presented. This approach is based on localized wet treatment of silicon wafers using confined and dynamic liquid drop that while {{in contact with the}} wafer forms a dynamic liquid meniscus. Such new technique allows to touch in specific defined positions the silicon wafer (front and/or back) in order to perform any kind of wet processing without the need of protective photo-resist. The new selective processing technique allows the metallizations (front and back) of mono and multi crystalline silicon solar cells. The front grid contacts are obtained by locally etching the silicon nitride, forming in a thin layer of meso-porous silicon and totally filling the meso-porous layer by pulse <b>reverse</b> <b>plating</b> a Nickel film. Copper and Tin are then electroplated using the same selective processing. This technology provides an effective solution to avoid silver pastes for front contact grid, as it guarantees low specific contact resistivity (550 μΩcm 2 on a 75 Ω/□ n-type doped emitter) and good adhesion to the silicon substrate (i. e. greater than 550 g/mm). The Al back side of the solar cell are also treated by the new selective process.

The latest SOP baseline process test vehicle has been fabricated on novel Si-matched CTE, high modulus C-SiC composite core substrates using 10 mum thick BCB dielectric films with loss tangent of 0. 0008 and dielectric constant of 2. 65. A semi-additive plating process has been developed for multilayer microvia build-up using BCB without the use of any vacuum deposition or polishing/CMP processes. PWB and package substrate compatible processes such as plasma surface treatment/desmear and electroless/electrolytic pulse <b>reverse</b> <b>plating</b> was used. The smallest line width and space demonstrated in this paper is 6 mum with microvia diameters in the 15 - 30 mum range. This build-up process has also been developed on medium CTE organic laminates including MCL-E- 679 F from Hitachi Chemical and PTFE laminates with Cu-Invar-Cu core. Embedded decoupling capacitors with capacitance density of > 500 nF/cm 2 have been integrated into the build-up layers using sol-gel synthesized BaTiO 3 thin films (200 - 300 nm film thickness) deposited on copper foils and integrated using vacuum lamination and subtractive etch processes.
