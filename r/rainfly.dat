5000|$|Venezuelan or jungle hammocks {{made today}} are {{generally}} of breathable nylon or polyester, and use dacron or similar non-stretch suspension lines. They are [...] "inline" [...] hammocks; like the canvas naval hammocks of old, the occupant sleeps {{along the length}} of the hammock, rather than across it. With their breathable false bottoms, drip strings, sandfly netting, and optional <b>rainfly,</b> they are one of the most secure hammocks against not only water entry, but also insect stings or bites.|$|E
5000|$|The Venezuelan hammock's panels {{were always}} made of {{breathable}} material, {{necessary to prevent}} the onset of fungal infections caused by constant rain and high humidity. [...] Fine-woven sandfly netting was eventually added to provide more complete protection from mosquitoes, flies, and crawling insects, especially in regions notorious for malaria or screwworm infestations. A waterproof top sheet or <b>rainfly</b> could be added to protect the occupant from drenching by heavy nighttime rains, along with drip strings - short pieces of string tied to suspension lines â€” to prevent rainwater running from the tree trunk down the hammock cords to the hammock itself. A breathable false cotton (later nylon) bottom panel was frequently added to these jungle hammocks, allowing air to pass through while still preventing mosquito stings to the occupant.|$|E
