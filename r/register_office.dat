40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the spatial distribution and accessibility of Land <b>Register</b> <b>Offices</b> in Hungary. The spatial distribution of Land <b>Register</b> <b>Offices,</b> according to route distances, has an uneven characteristic. One reason for this fact is the different settlement structure of the various counties, the second reason is the uneven road system in Hungary. The accessibility of Land <b>Register</b> <b>Offices</b> is significantly different in various counties. Since the services of the Land <b>Register</b> <b>Offices</b> belong to the public services, it would be a real and justifiable claim to moderate this huge spatial difference...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{his fame}} and popularity, like many former {{servicemen}} contending with post-war economic hardship, Smith struggled financially – a predicament compounded by illness. As a consequence he pawned his medals for £20, only {{for them to}} be recovered by the Jewish Historical Society on the urging of the wife of Chief Rabbi Joseph Hertz and ultimately reunited with Smith. Smith's varied occupations in post-war Britain included work as an actor with a theatre troupe. He emigrated to Australia in 1925 with his wife Elsie (née McKechnie), whom he had married at Camberwell <b>Register</b> <b>Office.</b> Marriage to Elsie produced two children (Olive and Maurice) and reputedly angered his parents despite the couple's later observance of Jewish religious tradition in a formal ceremony held at Central Synagogue, Hallam Street.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Hammond {{spent much}} of his leave with Ness-Harvey in South Africa. In 1945, she {{followed}} him back to England, but did not like it. When Hammond left to tour Australia in 1946–47, Ness-Harvey remained behind with his mother, with whom she did not get along. This was one of the factors which led to Hammond's problems on the tour. His divorce went through, and on his return, he and Sybil married at Kingston <b>Register</b> <b>Office.</b> She had already changed her name to Hammond by deed poll. Their first child, Roger, was born in 1948. Carolyn was born in 1950 and Valerie was born in 1952.|$|E

Peter Brown and Evans passed the <b>register</b> <b>office</b> at 9.15, and saw that there were only a few photographers and ardent fans {{standing}} in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30am, they were mobbed by a crowd of about 1,000 people.

She had {{run away}} from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium. Introduced by Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London's West End. Laying his head in her lap, a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed {{together}} ten minutes after they first met. Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, {{and in the second}} half of 1936 were courting. They married at the <b>register</b> <b>office</b> in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937. In early 1938 they moved to Wales, renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire.

50|$|In the United Kingdom {{and many}} other common law countries, the <b>registered</b> <b>office</b> address {{does not have to}} be where the {{organization}} conducts its actual business or trade, and it is not unusual for law firms, accountants or incorporation agents to provide the official <b>registered</b> <b>office</b> address service. In the United Kingdom all statutory correspondence for an incorporated organization (e.g. formal notices, service of process, tax and government communications) are postal mailed or hand delivered to the stated <b>registered</b> <b>office</b> address as recorded on the Companies House register. A <b>registered</b> physical <b>office</b> address is required for incorporated organizations to receive official correspondence and formal notices from government departments, investors, banks, shareholders and the general public.Under regulations implemented in the UK on 1 October 2009, company directors may now also use a <b>registered</b> <b>office</b> address instead of their private home address for contact on the Companies House register.The companies full registered name must appear in manner publicly visible on the premises. The Company's records previously had to be kept at the <b>registered</b> <b>office</b> and available for public inspection. Since 1 October 2009 it has been possible for companies to designate a single alternative inspection location (SAIL) as a place to keep their records which must be available for public inspection.|$|R

5|$|Maureen Hindley married David Smith on 15 August 1964. The {{marriage}} was hastily arranged and performed at a <b>register</b> <b>office.</b> None of Hindley's relatives attended; Myra {{did not approve}} of the marriage, and her mother was too embarrassed—Maureen was seven months pregnant. The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house. The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to Windermere. This {{was the first time}} Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour. The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank. The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine. The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings. Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.|$|E
5|$|McNicoll relinquished {{command of}} HMAS Australia in July 1954 before the cruiser was paid off and marked for {{disposal}} the following month, and he briefly returned to duties at the Navy Office. In November, he embarked for London {{to attend the}} Imperial Defence College {{as part of the}} 1955 course intake, which signified that he had been marked for senior command. McNicoll and his wife, Ruth, had separated in 1950 and their divorce, which cited adultery as the cause, was finalised in October 1956, while the former was still in London. On 17 May the following year, McNicoll wed Frances Mary Chadwick, a journalist, in the Hampstead <b>register</b> <b>office.</b> Made acting rear admiral in January 1957, McNicoll was appointed as Head of the Australian Joint Service Staff in London.

5|$|On 28 August 1924 Blyton married Major Hugh Alexander Pollock, DSO (1888–1971) at Bromley <b>Register</b> <b>Office,</b> without {{inviting}} her family. They married {{shortly after}} he divorced from his first wife, {{with whom he had}} two sons. Pollock was editor of the book department in the publishing firm of George Newnes, which became her regular publisher.

They initially lived in a flat in Chelsea before moving to Elfin Cottage in Beckenham in 1926, and then to Old Thatch in Bourne End (called Peterswood in her books) in 1929.
