40|$|Humans {{frequently}} {{come into}} conflict with marine mammals that compete for the same resources, such as seals exploiting the same areas as industrial fisheries. To develop efficient interventions to minimize {{the negative impact of}} seals on fisheries, it is essential to understand the behaviour of seals in the fishery area, such as where and when they occur. The present study characterizes an instance of human–seal conflict, using acoustic telemetry to examine patterns in the occurrence of three Kuril harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) around a small fixed set-net in Akkeshi Bay, eastern Hokkaido, Japan, in late spring in 2009. To examine the environmental variables affecting the occurrence of Kuril seals around the net, 3 Kuril seals were captured and tracked using an acoustic monitoring system. Two of the tracked individuals (a male and a female) usually came to the net in the evening, and at high tide, but the seals were never present at times when fishing occurred (04 : 00 – 07 : 00 h), which indicates that they actively avoided human activity in the coastal fishery. Seals did not appear in the net after the fishery season (April), a behavioural characteristic that suggests that these seals were adults that used a nearby haul-out site during the breeding season (May–June). A third individual, an adult male, never occurred near the net. These observations demonstrate the extent to which individual seals vary in their interactions with human activities. Given the current selective <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> in the fishery area by controlled killing or driving away, these findings have the potential to inform targeted management intervention to minimize conflict between economic and conservation interests...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEcosystems are {{composed}} of the physical environment and the species that live in them (the abiotic and biotic components of an ecosystem, respectively). Today there is great concern {{for the effects of}} climate change (change in the abiotic component) on Antarctic marine ecosystems, while relatively little attention is being given to the effects of harvesting of living resources (change in the biotic component). However, direct impacts on the biotic components of an ecosystem have the potential to affect the structure of the food web, including creating possible cascades that affect biogeochemistry, over time scales that are faster than those resulting from physical changes. Since the late 1800 s, commercial <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals,</b> whales and finfish changed food web structure in waters of the Antarctic Peninsula and insular shelves, e. g., that of the Scotia Sea, before baseline scientific data on these ecosystems were acquired and before the first signs of global warming became evident. Until 1997, the Ross Sea marine ecosystem remained relatively unaffected by human extraction, so that its food webs are arguably the closest worldwide to those that existed in a 'pristine' ocean prior to human harvesting. The consequences of harvesting are difficult to measure, but throughout the Southern Ocean important changes in ecosystem structure due to excessive exploitation have been observed. These changes include the collapse or diminishment of marine mammal and fish stocks and the reduction in average individual size of fish from targeted populations. Several conceptual models have been developed to explain these changes and/or to predict possible consequences (reduced population viability; trophic cascades; reduced carrying capacity). Robust predictions about the consequences of continuing the business as usual approach to harvesting Southern Ocean resources can be made based on comparisons with exploited marine ecosystems elsewhere. Current Ross Sea harvesting rates have the potential to reduce fish stocks below a level at which they may be self-sustaining, foment trophic cascades and alter food web structure. These changes will be accompanied by loss of ecosystem and commercial values, with those metrics related to conservation values still poorly defined and not taken into account in the management decision process...|$|E
40|$|Packaging protects food {{products}} from environmental influences, assuring quality and safety throughout shelf life if properly performed. Packaging quality {{depends on the}} quality of the packaging material and of the closure or seal. A common problem possibly jeopardizing seal quality is the presence <b>of</b> <b>seal</b> contamination, which can cause a decreased seal strength, an increased packaging failure risk and leak formation. Therefore, early detection and <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>seal</b> contaminated packages from the production chain is crucial. In this work, a pulsed-type active thermography method using the heated seal bars as an excitation source was studied for detecting seal contamination. Thermal image sequences <b>of</b> contaminated <b>seals</b> were recorded shortly after sealing. The detection performances of six thermal image processing methods, based on a single frame, a fit of the cooling profiles, thermal signal reconstruction, pulsed phase thermography, principal component thermography and a matched filter, were compared. High resolution digital images served as a reference to quantify seal contamination, and processed thermal images were mapped to these references. The lowest detection limit (equivalent diameter 0. 60 mm) was obtained for the method based on a fit of the cooling profiles. Moreover, the detection performance of this method did not depend strongly on the time after sealing at which recording of the thermal images was started, making it a robust and generally applicable method. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|There {{is great}} {{interest}} in the perceived conflict between salmon fisheries and seals, but little information to inform managers.   This study therefore explored the interactions between harbour seals and salmonids within an estuarine system, the Cromarty Firth, NE Scotland (57 ° 37 ’N, 4 ° 21 ’W).   The number <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> using this area in the 2000 pupping season {{was estimated to be}} 188 (138 - 286) using a novel Bayesian framework that corrected counts <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> on land for those remaining in the water. The presence <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> in the mouth of the River Conon, {{at the head of the}} Firth, and the occurrence of salmonid otoliths in seal scats, were related to changes in the abundance of adult salmonids.   Overall, salmonid otoliths were found in 8 % of scat samples and 21 % of those collected during July.   This represents the highest reported incidence of salmonid otoliths from scat samples collected in the UK;  it is not clear if this is due to temporal or geographic differences with previous work. A novel diet estimation technique was constructed based on the assumption that seals may be employing one of a range of possible foraging strategies.   This estimator was compared to two established methods and it was found that model choice introduced considerable introduced considerable bias (up to 3 x) in the estimated importance of salmonids in the diet.   It is unclear which of the models is appropriate and their outputs were combined to represent uncertainty in our estimates of diet more fully. It was not possible to partition consumption of salmonids between salmon and sea trout as otoliths were too badly digested to allow identification of species.   A simple food web was used to suggest that <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>seal</b> predation may improve fishery catch by 17 % (5 - 52 %).   This figure must be treated with caution and potential biases, and caveats, are discussed.

40|$|The {{importance}} of a given host to a particular parasite can be determined according to three different criteria: host preference, host physiological suitability and host contribution to transmission. Most studies on the sealworm Pseudoterranova decipiens have focussed on the latter factor, but few {{attempts have been made}} to develop a quantitative transmission model evaluating the relative {{importance of}} each host. The purpose of this study was to propose a flow-chart model to study sealworm transmission within a seal community. The model was applied to hypothetical data <b>of</b> four <b>seal</b> species acting as definitive hosts of P. decipiens sensu stricto in eastern Canada: harp seal Phoca groenlandica, harbour seal P. vitulina, grey seal Halichoerus grypus and hooded seal Cystophora cristata. The dynamics of the model was studied using population estimates from 1990 to 1996. To illustrate the interrelationship <b>of</b> the <b>seal</b> populations in the flow dynamics, the model’s behaviour was explored by manipulation <b>of</b> the harp <b>seal</b> population size. The results showed that grey seals accounted by far for most transmission from and to the seals. The harbour seal population also sustained a biologically significant proportion of the flow, whereas the role of hooded and harp seals seemed negligible despite their large population sizes. The hypothetical <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the harp <b>seal</b> population resulted in small increases in the relative flows to the other seals. These results conform to previous qualitative assessments on the relative importance <b>of</b> these <b>seal</b> species in sealworm transmission. The model provided some heuristic rules useful to understand transmission patterns. The data suggested that the harbour seal population should be about twice that <b>of</b> the grey <b>seals</b> to account for a larger share of transmission than grey seals. Although this is unlikely to occur at a large geographic scale, harbour seals outnumber grey seals in some areas and, therefore, the role of each host may change locally. To make this approach more realistic, further work should seek accurate estimates of parasite population parameters, better definition of the host community boundaries (at a local scale) and improved control of confounding variables...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 101 A major {{producer}} of ethylene installed and is successfully operating a nonpressurized dual gas seal in liquid methane service. The least reliable pump {{in the unit}} was a single stage overhung centrifugal pump in demethanizer reflux service. The process fluid is marginally over its vapor pressure at a temperature of - 140 F (- 96 C) and pressure of 502 psig (3461 kPa). The pump was originally installed with a dual nonpressurized mechanical seal using n-propanol as the barrier fluid. There were numerous seal problems on the pump and the mean time between repair (MTBR) averaged four months. Many modifications {{were made to the}} sealing system with little or no improvement in the MTBR. A joint development project was initiated involving plant and seal supplier personnel to investigate the use <b>of</b> dual gas <b>seal</b> technology in this service. A cartridge, nonpressureized series arrangement dual gas seal was designed and thoroughly tested before installation in the plant. Testing included operation with a light hydrocarbon in both the liquid and vapor phases. Incorporating an interstage and external labyrinth with an inert gas sweep satisfied low environmental emissions requirements. A purge and vent control panel system was developed to monitor and establish appropriate gas purge and vent settings for containment and emissions purposes. Installation at the plant included a close clearance throat bushing and <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seal</b> flush to encourage vapor accumulation in the seal chamber. The first seal was installed in the plant on January 1, 1997, and has operated through November 1998 without problems. The methane vapor emissions at the outboard labyrinth are consistently measured at less than 250 parts per million. The seal has dramatically improved the reliability of this critical pump even under upset conditions. This paper details the seal design parameters, laboratory testing, seal installation, and operation of the pump and support system. The application of this technology can assist plants in reducing emissions, increasing pump MTBR, reducing maintenance costs, and increasing equipment reliability...|$|R

In 2002, gamma-ray data and samples of tailings, uncrushed and crushed waste rock, stream sediment, topsoil and vegetation were collected to assist in examination of the current environmental status of the mine site. The data indicate that capping of tailings storage facilities did not ensure the long-term containment of the low-level radioactive wastes due to the erosion of sides of the impoundments. Moreover, wind erosion of waste fines (phyllosilicates, ore minerals) from various, physically unstable waste repositories has caused increasing radiochemical (from a background dose of 35 - 70 nSv/hr to max. 0. 94 Sv/hr) and geochemical (Ce, Cr, La, Lu, Rb, Sc, Th, U, V, Y, Yb) impacts on local soils.
