30|$|The {{average stress}} wave {{propagation}} velocities of the vertical <b>roof</b> <b>struts</b> and the <b>roof</b> girder, made of Japanese red pines, were 5091.3 and 4897.6  m/s, respectively. The average Young’s moduli of both were {{estimated to be}} 11.1 and 12.3  kN/mm 2, respectively, from the propagation velocity via Monte Carlo simulation method.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} was restored in 1984-1985. Few interior fittings and furnishings remain, but the organisation {{of the internal}} space is relatively intact. Rooms {{on the ground floor}} are used for exhibitions while the first floor contains offices and a craft gallery. Original <b>roof</b> <b>strutting</b> is visible in the uppermost floor of the 1860s section and staircases and fireplaces have been retained. The tiered seating and balconies in {{the first floor of the}} lecture hall remain.|$|R

50|$|Building {{elements}} {{like the}} carved Newar window, <b>roof</b> <b>struts</b> on temples and the tympanum of temples and shrine houses exhibit traditional creativity. From {{as early as}} the seventh century, visitors have noted the skill of Newar artists and craftsmen who left their influence on the art of Tibet and China. Newars introduced the lost-wax technique into Bhutan and they were commissioned to paint murals on the walls of monasteries there. Sandpainting of mandala made during festivals and death rituals is another specialty of Newar art.|$|R
30|$|When 83  % of {{the total}} load of roof and roof frame had been removed, the stress acting on the members was {{determined}} from the estimated Young’s modulus and the strain measurement value. The average vertical stress of the vertical <b>roof</b> <b>struts</b> was 4.4  N/mm 2; the bending stress on the strain measurement positions of the roof girder were determined to be 3.1 – 5.9  N/mm 2. The order of these values matched the results from 2 D-FEM analysis when it was supposed that the some joint did not work enough.|$|R
50|$|The temple is a double-roofed {{structure}} {{where the}} idol of Lord Vishnu in his incarnation as Narayana is deified. The exquisitely built temple has intricate <b>roof</b> <b>struts</b> showing multi-armed Tantric deities. A kneeling image of Garuda (dated to the 5th century), the vahana or vehicle of Vishnu with a snake around its neck, faces the temple. The gilded door depicts stone lions guarding the temple. Gilded windows also flank the door. A conch and a disc, symbols of Vishnu, are carved {{on the two}} pillars at the entrance. Non-Hindus are not allowed inside the temple.|$|R
50|$|The Indreshwar temple {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and tallest pagoda style temples in Nepal. It was {{originally}} built over a lingam in 1294, making it the oldest surviving temple of Nepal. The <b>roof</b> <b>struts</b> embellishing the two lower stories of the temple are distinct Nepalese wood-carving and architecture. The upper section of the temple is hung with pots and pans, offerings from young married couples hoping for a happy and prosperous family life. Unfortunately, the 1998 earthquake caused considerable damage and the building is still awaiting for restoration.|$|R

50|$|The City Core {{has most}} of the {{remarkable}} cultural wealth that evolved {{during the reign of}} the Malla kings between 15th and 18th centuries. The city was filled with sculptures, pagodas, stupas and palace buildings of exceptional beauty. There are also 106 monastic courtyards (known as baha or bahi) known for their art and piety. The level of skill of the local artisans are the exquisite wood carving, stone carving, metal casting, weaving, pottery and other crafts. The finest wood carvings are seen on the ornate windows of old buildings and on the <b>roof</b> <b>struts</b> of temples. Carving skills of the local artisans are seen at every street corner in the form of images of gods and goddesses and sunken water spouts.|$|R
50|$|The M4 also {{includes}} an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, electric steering, additional bolted joints between the axle subframe {{and the body}} sills, aluminium stiffening plate and a five-link rear suspension constructed from aluminium Carbon-fibre {{is used for the}} <b>roof,</b> bootlid, <b>strut</b> brace and driveshaft. Unusually, the suspension subframes are directly connected to the chassis without rubber bushings. An optional head-up display comes with additional M-specific functions such as a gear display, rev counter and Optimum Shift Indicator.|$|R
50|$|A {{manufactured}} home {{is built}} entirely inside a huge, climate-controlled factory {{by a team}} of craftsmen. The first step in the process is the flooring, which is built in sections, each attached to a permanent chassis with its own wheels and secured for transport upon the home’s completion. Depending {{on the size of the}} house and the floorplan’s layout, there may be two, three or even four sections. The flooring sections have heating, electrical and plumbing connections pre-installed before they are finished with laminate, tile or hardwood. Next, the walls are constructed on a flat level surface with insulation and interior Sheetrock before being lifted by crane into position and secured to the floor sections. The interior ceilings and <b>roof</b> <b>struts</b> are next, vapor sealed and secured to each section’s wall frame before being shingled. Then, the exterior siding is added, along with the installation of doors and windows. Finally, interior finishing, such as sealing the drywall, is completed, along with fixture installation and finishing the electrical and plumbing connections. The exposed portions of each section, where they will eventually be joined together, are wrapped in plastic to protect them for transport.|$|R
30|$|The Young’s moduli of all 32 roof girders and 7 <b>roof</b> {{vertical}} <b>struts</b> (6 {{of these}} were subject to strain measurement) inside the roof frame were estimated using the stress wave propagation velocity measurement prior to the demolition (2009 December). A portable resonant-type stress wave propagation timer (FAKOPP) {{was used for the}} measurement of the stress wave propagation velocity. To avoid the influence of mortises and other members for both roof girders and vertical <b>roof</b> <b>struts</b> on the stress wave measurement, it was ensured that the joints were not within the stress wave propagation range of the placed sensors. The measuring distance of stress wave was taken in a length range as far as possible. Therefore, the measuring distance for each member is different. As shown in Table  1, the average measuring distances for roof girders and <b>roof</b> vertical <b>struts</b> were 5829 and 513  mm, respectively. To obtain stable values, the average values for stress wave propagation time were determined by measuring those at each position three times. The propagation velocity, V, was calculated using the average propagation time and the measuring distance. In this study, we adopted the method of estimating the Young’s modulus using only the propagation velocity without measuring the density. That is, using the Monte Carlo simulation method based on the existing database of mechanical properties of Japanese lumbers [5], the Young’s modulus, E, was estimated from the propagation velocity; refer to the Ref. [5] for the detailed method. The database of mechanical properties for estimation purposes is currently being accumulated in research institutes across Japan, and data for the relationship between Young’s modulus of softwood lumber in full scale and its density exist. In this study, the database of “ALL” (means the database including data of all species; n =  12967) was employed [6]; refer to the Ref. [6] for the detailed information. As described above, the moisture content on the surface of members was assumed to be 10  % although it was impossible to measure the overall moisture content of the material. Overall moisture content was taken to be a value lower than 15  %, a typical air-dry moisture content of Japan. It has been reported that the moisture content on the surface of old materials decreases over time [7]: therefore, the measured moisture content for old materials in this study was considered to be at the normal air-dry state. As this study intended to investigate the stress state at the present time, moisture content correction for the stress wave propagation velocity and the estimation of Young’s modulus was not considered.|$|R
50|$|These large volume, covered {{goods wagons}} can be {{distinguished}} from the A9 DSV wagon version by their different <b>roof</b> shape, trapezoidal <b>strut</b> frame and diagonal braces on the wagon body in the section next to the door. They were built in rivetted and, later, in welded form in various configurations: with end doords on one or both ends and sometimes with exchangeable wheelsets and/or steam heating pipes. The Gl wagons were often used in Leig-Einheit pairs for the transportation of express, part-load goods.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{was constructed in}} the 15th and 16th century, and was altered in the 19th century. The {{building was}} set out in an L-shape. As of the 20th century, the foundations exist, along with the brick and stone structure with 19th century windows {{on the ground and}} first floor; the timber-framed hall was completely demolished. A partial collar and <b>strut</b> <b>roof</b> with moulded tie beams remained as of 1985, as well as a Tudor-headed fireplace with shield and cornice and a 19th-century range.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has also}} been found in ancient {{furniture}} from archaeological sites in the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Many instances are found, for example, in ruins of houses in the Silk Road kingdom of Cadota, dating from the first to the fourth century BC. [...] In traditional Chinese architecture, wood components, such as beams, brackets, <b>roof</b> frames and <b>struts,</b> were made to interlock with perfect fit, without using fasteners or glues, enabling the wood to expand and contract according to humidity. Archaeological evidence from Chinese sites shows that, {{by the end of}} the Neolithic, mortise-and-tenon joinery was employed in Chinese construction.|$|R
50|$|The {{level of}} detail to which a roof system is {{engineered}} varies greatly among engineers. At a bare minimum, the roof framing plans should show the rafter layout, specify the size and spacing of the rafters, and specify the allowable span of the rafters. Some engineers today provide only this minimal amount of detail on the roof framing plans they generate. Other engineers provide a much higher degree of detail. In addition to the items mentioned above, they show the location of all <b>roof</b> supports (i.e. <b>struts)</b> and show all purlins with dimensions to tie down their location. Generally speaking, the more detailed the roof framing plan, the higher quality the roof frame engineering.|$|R
5000|$|After the floods, it {{was decided}} to rebuild new houses higher up in the village. The {{architect}} Vilhelm Tvede (1826-1891) developed a new design, unique in Denmark, for the fishermen's houses, known today as [...] "Hesnæs houses", with half-timbered, straw-clad walls, thatched <b>roofs</b> and horizontal-containing <b>struts</b> along the facade. Their carved window and door frames are also characteristic. After Tvede's death, it was his son, Gotfred Tvede, who completed the work on behalf of Det Classenske Fideicommis, the foundation set up by Classen. It was also Gotfred who gave the houses a straw lining to protect the half-timbered stone walls from the wind and wet sea mist. The houses were built with living quarters at one end and a stall at the other end.|$|R
60|$|They {{were now}} in the open country; the houses were very few and {{scattered}} at long intervals, often miles apart. Occasionally they came upon a cluster of poor cottages, some with a chair or low board put across the open door to keep the scrambling children from the road, others shut up close while all the family were working in the fields. These were often the commencement of a little village: and after an interval came a wheelwright's shed or perhaps a blacksmith's forge; then a thriving farm with sleepy cows lying about the yard, and horses peering over the low wall and scampering away when harnessed horses passed upon the road, as though in triumph at their freedom. There were dull pigs too, turning up the ground in search of dainty food, and grunting their monotonous grumblings as they prowled about, or crossed {{each other in their}} quest; plump pigeons skimming round the <b>roof</b> or <b>strutting</b> on the eaves; and ducks and geese, far more graceful in their own conceit, waddling awkwardly about the edges of the pond or sailing glibly on its surface. The farm-yard passed, then came the little inn; the humbler beer-shop; and the village tradesman's; then the lawyer's and the parson's, at whose dread names the beer-shop trembled; the church then peeped out modestly from a clump of trees; then there were a few more cottages; then the cage, and pound, and not unfrequently, on a bank by the way-side, a deep old dusty well. Then came the trim-hedged fields on either hand, and the open road again.|$|R
