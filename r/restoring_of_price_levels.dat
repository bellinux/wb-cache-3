The problem of restricting the number <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> and the assignment <b>of</b> one <b>price</b> <b>level</b> to each sector at each time period is studied using a simulation based on a Logit discrete choice model.

40|$|The {{previous}} {{literature on}} the benefits <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>level</b> versus inflation targeting has, with some qualifications, established that <b>price</b> <b>level</b> targeting entails lower <b>price</b> <b>level</b> variance {{at the expense of}} higher inflation and output variance. This paper investigates the properties of monetary regimes that combine <b>price</b> <b>level</b> and inflation targeting. It offers two characterisations of these regimes: a set of optimal control rules obtained assuming that policy-makers minimise a loss function that penalises a mixed price level/inflation target; and a set of simple rules feeding back from alternative combinations of (current and future-dated) <b>price</b> <b>level</b> and inflation deviations from target. Asymptotic variances are derived <b>of</b> the <b>price</b> <b>level,</b> inflation and output associated with each of these regimes when the economy is modelled as a small-scale open-economy RE model calibrated on UK data. The conclusions are that: (i) the relative merits <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>level</b> and inflation targeting, as well as of mixes of these two, are a function of several modelling and policy assumptions; and (ii) these merits do not change monotonically in the move from one regime to another.

40|$|Differences in <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> {{as well as}} {{inflation}} {{rates among}} countries have been subject of discussion for a long time. More than the actual levels, however, the question <b>of</b> determinants <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> in time and a possible convergence is key for the new member states {{with respect to the}} Maastricht criteria. The dynamics <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> is crucial, and many suggestions have been put forward to explain the observed trends and changes. This thesis focuses on the determinants <b>of</b> relative <b>price</b> <b>level,</b> and hence real exchange rate, developments in the new member states of the EU and employs a regression analysis to examine their change in time.
