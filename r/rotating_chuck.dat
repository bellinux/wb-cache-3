5000|$|Spin welding systems {{consist of}} two chucks for holding the {{materials}} to be welded, {{one of which}} is fixed and the other rotating. Before welding, one of the work pieces is attached to the <b>rotating</b> <b>chuck</b> along with a flywheel of a given weight. The piece is then spun up to a high rate of rotation to store the required energy in the flywheel. Once spinning at the proper speed, the motor is removed and the pieces forced together under pressure. The force is kept on the pieces after the spinning stops to allow the weld to [...] "set".|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} laser {{surface modification}} work performed {{to improve the}} lifetime of die materials. Die material AISI H 13, with typical hardness {{in the range of}} 42 to 48 HRC, offers high wear and corrosion resistance. However the cyclic high temperature conditions along with exposure to high viscosity molten metal in semi-solid forming cause the die to wear and crack with resultant shortened die lifetime. In this study, the thermal stability of die material at elevated temperature was investigated through micro-hardness testing and a metallographic study. AISI H 13 samples were laser glazed using CO 2 continuous wave mode laser with 10. 6 µm wavelength. Samples were attached to a specially designed <b>rotating</b> <b>chuck</b> to enable it to be rotated at speeds up to 1500 rpm and allow flat surface glazing to take place. The micro-hardness was measured for as-glazed samples and annealed samples which were held at temperatures ranging from 550 o C t...|$|E
40|$|Rotary endodontic {{instruments}} {{have different}} cross sectional designs that may effect their resistance to torsional stress. The {{purpose of this}} study is to evaluate the static torsional properties of two nickel titanium files that have recently been introduced for use in endodontics and compare them to the same size Profile instruments. Ten new files of each brand and size were tested. The files tested were: RaCe 25 tip 0. 02, 0. 04, 0. 06 taper, K 3 and Profile 25 and 40 tip in 0. 02, 0. 04 and 0. 06 taper. The diameter of each file was measured at 3 mm from tip. The last three millimeters of the working area of the file was grasped with a non-rotating stainless steel chuck and the handle was held in freely <b>rotating</b> <b>chuck.</b> Torque was applied with the Instron Universal Tester in a counter-clockwise direction to simulate the direction of torque encountered clinically. The crosshead speed was set to produce 2 rotations per minute until fracture occurred. The maximum torque achieved and the rotations to fracture were recorded. A multi-way ANOVA of rotations revealed that RaCe 25 - 0. 02 exhibited significantly less rotations to fracture than Profile and K 3 of the same size (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). RaCe 25 tip exhibited lower maximum torque in all tapers than corresponding K 3 and Profile instruments. The mean diameter was significantly smaller for the RaCe files. In this study the RaCe file series exhibited lower values for maximum torque and rotations to fracture. These results should be taken into account while using these files clinically, however further testing is indicated...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{compares the}} quality of {{machined}} surface of graphite and aluminium alloy by abrasive water jet using the focusing tube with a diameter of df 1 = 0. 5 mm and df 2 = 0. 78 mm. The machining was carried out using the technology of rotating workpiece disintegration by abrasive water jet. Abrasive tangential water jet was used {{to carry out the}} experiment (water pressure p = 400 MPa). Workpieces were clamped in the <b>rotating</b> <b>chucking</b> appliance with rotation frequency n = 300 min- 1. The change in focusing tube diameter caused the change in values of roughness parameters, and also caused the change of resulting shape of workpieces. Values of roughness parameters were measured using the MicroProf FRT optic profilometer...|$|R

50|$|Evolutions is a {{title that}} {{features}} stand-alone, out-of-continuity tales from <b>rotating</b> creative teams. <b>Chuck</b> Dixon {{wrote the first}} four-part series Hearts of Steel, revolving around steam-powered Transformers on Earth in the 19th Century, with art by former Dreamwave artist Guido Guidi. It premiered in July 2006. At its conclusion, the publishers warned {{that they needed to}} be conservative with alternate-reality stories, because both they and Hasbro did not want to make things too confusing before the 2007 movie was released. For this reason, the series is on hold until after the movie premieres, but a trade paperback has been released.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} laser {{surface modification}} work performed {{to improve the}} lifetime of die materials. Die material AISI H 13, with typical hardness {{in the range of}} 42 to 48 HRC, offers high wear and corrosion resistance. However the cyclic high temperature conditions along with exposure to high viscosity molten metal in semi 6 solid forming cause the die to wear and crack with resultant shortened die lifetime. In this study, the thermal stability of die material at elevated temperature was investigated through micro 6 hardness testing and a metallographic study. AISI H 13 samples were laser glazed using CO 2 continuous wave mode laser with 10. 6 9 m wavelength. Samples were attached to a specially designed <b>rotating</b> <b>chuck</b> to enable it to be rotated at speeds up to 1500 rpm and allow flat surface glazing to take place. The microhardness was measured for as 6 glazed samples and annealed samples which were held at temperatures ranging from 550 oC to 800 oC with 50 oC intervals. The metallographic study conducted examined the formation of three zones at different depths which were the glazed zone, the heat affected zone and the substrate. As a result of rapid heating and cooling from the laser glazing process, a metallic glass layer was developed which exhibited an average micro 6 hardness of 900 HV when exposed to 3. 34 E+ 10 W/m 2 laser irradiance within a range of 3. 64 to 5. 66 ms exposure time. Crystallization in glazed zone increased as the annealing temperature increased. As the annealing temperature reached above approximately 600 oC, the microhardness decreased to approximately 600 HV (equivalent to approx. 54 HRC) due to local crystallization. These findings show potential direct application of glazed dies for non 6 ferrous semisolid forming and the requirement for thermal barrier protection for application at higher temperatures...|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{stand-alone}} small hole drilling EDM machines with an x-y axis {{also known as}} a super drill or hole popper that can machine blind or through holes. EDM drills bore holes with a long brass or copper tube electrode that <b>rotates</b> in a <b>chuck</b> with a constant flow of distilled or deionized water flowing through the electrode as a flushing agent and dielectric. The electrode tubes operate like the wire in wire-cut EDM machines, having a spark gap and wear rate. Some small-hole drilling EDMs are able to drill through 100 mm of soft or through hardened steel in less than 10 seconds, averaging 50% to 80% wear rate. Holes of 0.3 mm to 6.1 mm can be achieved in this drilling operation. Brass electrodes are easier to machine but are not recommended for wire-cut operations due to eroded brass particles causing [...] "brass on brass" [...] wire breakage, therefore copper is recommended.|$|R
