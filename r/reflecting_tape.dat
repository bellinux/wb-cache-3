40|$|AbstractTransparent armor {{consists}} of glass-polymer laminates in most cases. The formation and propagation of {{damage in the}} different glass layers has a strong influence on the ballistic resistance of such laminates. In order to clarify {{the course of events}} during projectile penetration, an experimental technique was developed, which allows visualizing the onset and propagation of damage in each single layer of the laminate. A telecentric objective lens was used together with a microsecond video camera that allows recording 100 frames at a maximum rate of 1  MHz in a backlit photography set-up. With this technique, the damage evolution could be visualized in glass laminates consisting of four glass layers with lateral dimensions 500  mm ×  500  mm. Damage evolution was recorded during penetration of 7. 62  mm AP projectiles with tungsten carbide core and a total mass of 11. 1  g in the impact velocity range from 800 to 880  m/s. In order to measure the deformation of single glass plates within the laminates, a piece of <b>reflecting</b> <b>tape</b> was attached to the corresponding glass plate, and photonic Doppler velocimetry (PDV) was applied. With the photonic Doppler velocimeter, an infrared laser is used to illuminate an object to be measured and the Doppler-shifted light is superimposed to a reference light beam at the detector. The simultaneous visualization and PDV measurement of the glass deformation allow determining the deformation {{at the time of the}} onset of fracture. The analysis of the experimental data was supported by numerical simulations, using the AUTODYN commercial hydro-code...|$|E

Determined to finish Ciao! Manhattan and have her story told, Sedgwick reconnected with Ciao! Manhattan filmmakers and began shooting in Arcadia, California and Santa Barbara in late 1970. She also recorded audio <b>tapes</b> <b>reflecting</b> on her life story, which Weisman and Palmer used to incorporate her accounts into the film's dramatic arc.

5000|$|Upon {{its release}} Dreamchasers 2 {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork Media gave the mixtape a 7.4 out of 10, saying [...] "It won't play as important {{a role in}} his narrative as the first edition, and that's saying something considering D2 currently sits at 4.1 million downloads on DatPiff alone. But it is of equal quality to the mixtape that broke him big, and that can only mean good things." [...] Carl Chery of XXL gave the mixtape an XL, saying [...] "The <b>tape</b> <b>reflects</b> an evolution in Meek’s subject matter. While Dreamchasers documented Meek’s struggles, its sequel speaks on hardships in the past tense. At 20 tracks, Dreamchasers 2 {{is sort of a}} long-player, but it fulfills its purpose in prepping Meek’s fans for the main event.|$|R
5000|$|Complex {{ranked the}} mixtape at number 34, {{on their list}} of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "INNANETAPE {{displays}} Vic's talent in its fullest fruition yet. As a rapper, Vic is physical, contorting words and playing with sounds. He bends the meter of songs in unexpected ways and dances freely between rapping and singing his lyrics. He's fun to listen to, his writing is dizzyingly dense and consistently interesting. But INNANETAPE {{is more than a}} show of great rapping—it's also an ambitious, musically omnivorous project that demonstrates Vic is an artist with a broad vision and a strong sense for building songs." [...] Rolling Stone named it the seventh best mixtape of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "Though he and Chance share a delirious flow and a keen eye for both self and society, Mensa's Innanetape is a bright blast of summertime sunshine highlighted by paeans to orange soda ("Orange Soda"), drugs ("Tweakin"), and, well, life ("Lovely Day"). XXL named it the eighth best mixtape of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "Vic Mensa proves that he can standout with INNANETAPE. ... The once frontman for popular band Kids These Days, he turns solo and puts out an impressive <b>tape</b> <b>reflecting</b> his experiences and observations of the turmoil in the Windy City. He displays great voice control, lyrical prowess and song-making ability throughout the record." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to 1) determine if responses from teachers to items on the pre- and post- administration of the questionnaires would change after viewing the Tap Tapes series and 2) provide members of the Tap - A - Talent committee with recommendations on how to proceed with the inservice process if, in fact, the process should continue. The pre- and post- questionnaires were mailed to randomly selected teachers of grades one through five employed by the school corporation during the 1980 - 81 school year. Usable questionnaires were returned by 101 teachers and constituted the sample for the study. Data reported represented changes in responses to items on the pre- and post- questionnaires as tabulated by number and percent. The following conclusions were formulated from the summary of the findings based on teacher responses on the pre- and post- questionnaires: 1. Teachers who viewed all or some of the seven-part Tap Tapes resulted in a small but positive increase in desired responses in the questionnaires. 2. The responses of teachers who viewed none of the Tap <b>Tapes</b> <b>reflected</b> a {{decrease in the number of}} desired responses in the questionnaire. 3. While many teachers participating in the study reported, by the responses, an overall agreement with the statements in the questionnaire prior to viewing the Tap <b>Tapes,</b> the data <b>reflect</b> a general strenthening of views and attitudes by teachers following the viewing of the tapes. 4. The video-tapes, mini-workshop series, known as Tap Tapes, appeared to be an effective inservice component. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R

TAPE (1]: MODEL GRAM: Tape (1) is the first part of a two-part nutrient data bank. The first 119 records of this tape are the acceptable FOOD MODELS or combinations of food models used to aid the respondent in recalling amounts of foods reported on the 24 -hour recall form. The second part of this tape consists of 2605 foods in number, food code number, numeric order with designated food group preferred model code, appropriate gram conversion factor, and alphameric description. When listed by food group, the MODEL GRAM tape providedt he basis for the coding manual used by dietary interviewers.

40|$|Tuesday, March 10, 1998 WRITER: Kathy R. Pharr, (706) 542 - 5172 CONTACT: Ronald L. Carlson, (706) 542 - 5186 STARR SHOULD 2 ̆ 2 SHOW US THE EVIDENCE! 2 ̆ 2 IN WAKE OF MCDOUGAL 2 ̆ 7 S DEATH, SAYS UGA LAW PROFESSOR ATHENS, Ga. [...] Echoing {{the call}} of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, UGA law {{professor}} and criminal law expert Ron Carlson has called for special prosecutor Kenneth Starr to 2 ̆ 2 show his cards 2 ̆ 2 and reveal the evidence derived from numerous interviews with James McDougal, the convicted Whitewater partner and former Clinton ally who {{died of a heart}} attack in federal prison on Sunday. McDougal, a key Whitewater witness, had recently supplied a steady stream of information to Starr in exchange for a reduced sentence. 2 ̆ 2 I would expect that in McDougal 2 ̆ 7 s case, there are paper documents that <b>reflect</b> his testimony, <b>tape</b> recordings and videotape recordings of what McDougal has to say, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 Because of his death, by and large, those documents are inadmissible evidence. A live witness has to appear and be open to cross-examination. In the absence of the author of the remarks, the tape recordings are hearsay evidence, which judges exclude from trials. 2 ̆ 2 According to Carlson, the time for public accountability is near, and 2 ̆ 2 nothing makes more sense 2 ̆ 2 than for Starr to release his star witness 2 ̆ 7 words to the press and public. 2 ̆ 2 It would not compromise his trial evidence, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson, 2 ̆ 2 so this seems the perfect opportunity for independent counsel Starr to inform the public, respond to Majority Leader Lott 2 ̆ 7 s call to show something of what he has, and finally, let us all out here in the public judge for ourselves whether he has anything or not. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson says Starr 2 ̆ 7 s next move will be dictated by the amount of pressure he feels from lawmakers, particularly if more Republicans demand a swift end to the investigation. 2 ̆ 2 I expect there will be enough pressure on Starr that he is going to need to make some important disclosures, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 Nobody knows precisely what McDougal has said because his dialogues with the independent counsel have been private. His statements might close the doors on Whitewater or they might throw them wide open. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson, a nationally recognized expert in evidence, trial practice and criminal procedure, has litigated many cases and has been admitted to practice before the U. S. Supreme Court. He has written numerous books on trial techniques and provided extensive commentary for the national media in high-profile trials. - 30...|$|R
