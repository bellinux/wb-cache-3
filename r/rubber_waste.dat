40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> loading on mechanical and thermal conductivity properties were investigated for NR composite. An experimental investigation {{was carried out}} to obtain low cost construction material with desirable mechanical and thermal insulation properties. Natural rubber was loaded with different concentrations of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> (200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000) phr. The addition of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> leads to {{a slight increase in}} thermal conductivity values of composites but it still lies around range of thermal insulating materials. Also addition of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> leads to improvement of mechanical properties of composites. The crosslink density of NR composite increases with the increase of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> loading until 600 phr and after that it decreases due to the stronger the rubber–filler interaction. This leads to the decrease of the swelling index that has the opposite trend of crosslink density. So, the sample with 600 phr <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> is considered the optimum concentration from the swelling measurement. Filler loading results in pronounced increase in the tensile modulus and decease in the elongation at fracture which reflects the reinforcement effect of the filler. The yield stress increases with <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> loading increment. This delays the permanent disruption of matrix morphology. So, the optimum concentration which is 600 phr <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> loading agrees with the swelling and mechanical measurements which has desirable thermal insulation and high mechanical properties and decreases the cost of materials to 82 % of the NR cost...|$|R

In order to recycle the <b>waste</b> polyurethane <b>rubbers,</b> we created a composite cube as a structural material by using the <b>waste</b> <b>rubbers.</b> The composite cube had 15 mm on a side.

The increase of heating rate help to suppress the formation of NH 3, however, to the formation ot HCN, it happens only in low pyrolysis temperature, and in high pyrolysis temperature, its inhibit function is small. Secondly, combustion experiment was carried out in tubular furnace, and the effect of reaction temperation and heating rate et. on the formation of NOx precursors was investigated. It shows that the release temperature of NOx precursors in combustion is obviously lower than that of pyrolysis. Even at the maximum reaction temperature during the pyrolysis experiment, the emission of the HCN and NH 3 is by far lower than that at 700 degree in combustion. The existing oxygen promotes the breakage of the more stable nitrogen heterocyclic ring, which increases productivity of the HCN and NH 3. HCN and NH 3 was oxidized to NOx at higher temperature. The temperature at which the productivity of the HCN and NH 3 reach to maximum value in combustion is different because of different raw materials. 由于焚烧法在减容化、无害化和资源化方面有其独特的特点，目前越来越多的国 和地区采用焚烧法来处理垃圾。但如果焚烧条件控制不当会存在烟气污染的的问题，如NOx。本文以废橡胶和废纸为研究对象进行热解实验和燃烧实验，考察NOx前驱体的生成规律。 首先在管式炉中对废橡胶和废纸进行热解实验，考察了反应温度、升温速率等对废橡胶和废纸热解NOx前驱体生成的影响。实验结果表明，废橡胶和废纸热解HCN和NH 3 的生成量随热解温度的升高而增加，升温速率的提高有助于抑制NH 3 的生成，而对HCN的生成仅在热解温度比较低时才有抑制作用，当热解温度较高时，升温速率的提高对HCN的抑制作用不大。 然后在管式炉中进行燃烧实验，考察了反应温度、升温速率等对两种原料燃烧NOx前驱体生成的影响。实验结果表明，燃烧过程中NOx前驱体的释放温度明显低于热解过程，即使在实验范围内的最大反应温度下，热解过程中HCN和NH 3 的释放量也远远低于燃烧过程中 700 ℃条件下的释放量。氧气的存在促进了稳定性较高的含氮杂环的破裂，导致了HCN和NH 3 产率的增加。在温度更高时，HCN和NH 3 将进一步被氧化生成NOx。因原料的不同，两种原料燃烧过程中HCN和NH 3 产率达最大值时所对应的温度不同...|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{recycling}} of production wastes and end-of-life engineering rubbers are presented. Cryogenic milling of the <b>rubber</b> <b>wastes</b> such as sealants, O-rings, flat and radial sealings results in very fine powder (less than 100 micron). The investigations {{have been performed}} with fluoroelastomers (FVMQ-OOR, FKM-WSi, FKM-RTF), HNBR moldings, and acrylate rubber-based O-rings. The rubber powders were blended with virgin rubbers and the vulcanization behavior, shrinkage, demolding, surface properties and mechanical properties such as tensile strength, permanent set, thermal aging and oil resistancy of the vulcanizates were evaluated. Hardly any effects of the recyclates {{on the quality of}} the rubber blends were observed.
