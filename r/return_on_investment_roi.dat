With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} {{economic}} growth is fundamental in capitalist economies. Productivity must grow as population grows and capital must grow to feed into increased productivity. Investment of capital leads to <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> (<b>ROI)</b> and increased capital accumulation. The hypothesis that economic inequality is a necessary precondition for economic growth has been a mainstay of liberal economic theory. Recent research, particularly over the first two decades of the 21st century, has called this basic assumption into question. While growing inequality does have a positive correlation with economic growth under specific sets of conditions, inequality in general is not positively correlated with economic growth and, under some conditions, shows a negative correlation with economic growth.|$|R
50|$|Higher-beta stocks {{tend to be}} more {{volatile}} and therefore riskier, but provide the potential for higher returns. Lower-beta stocks pose less risk but generally offer lower returns. Some have challenged this idea, claiming that the data show little relation between beta and potential reward, or even that lower-beta stocks are both less risky and more profitable (contradicting CAPM). In the same way a stock's beta shows its relation to market shifts, it is also an indicator for required <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> (<b>ROI).</b> Given a risk-free rate of 2%, for example, if the market (with a beta of 1) has an expected return of 8%, a stock with a beta of 1.5 should return 11% (= 2% + 1.5(8% − 2%)) in accordance with the financial CAPM model.|$|R

In this year, Cramp & Sons built its first marine engine, and henceforth was to purchase no more engines from Neafie & Levy, depriving the latter of a principal customer. Moreover, Cramp constructed a large dry dock which enabled it to enter the lucrative hull repair business. Jacob Neafie did not follow suit, preferring to rely upon his existing business model of building smaller iron vessels and supplying engines to builders of wooden ships. By 1880, although Neafie & Levy was still Philadelphia's most heavily capitalized firm with {{a million dollars in}} assets, its <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> (<b>ROI)</b> was only 7.1% compared to that of Cramp with an ROI in excess of 15%.

A positive ROI indicates that the proposed system implementation is worthwhile, whereas a negative ROI indicates that the investment cannot achieve the desired outcome. Discounting specific installations that are necessary, enterprises typically avoid implementing systems that cannot justify the investment cost. Although medical institutions are not-for-profit organizations, they should consider decision-making processes {{similar to those of}} for-profit businesses regarding the planning and assessment of healthcare-oriented cloud computing service systems. Decision makers should carefully consider the amount of cost savings that adopting cloud computing services can yield. Such savings are associated with the elimination of expenses concerning the acquisition of maintenance and management software, data storage devices, and other hardware; independent implementations of network system architectures; as well as software and hardware maintenance and upgrade. The opportunity costs potentially saved by adopting healthcare-oriented cloud computing service systems can be included as profits when assessing ROIs.|$|R

As a result, even though ESX server obtains the highest ROI and lowest TCO in server virtualization and Hyper-V R 2 gains the best performance of virtual machine management; both of them however cost too much.
