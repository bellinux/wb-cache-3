On April 18, 1990, {{a one-day}} Workshop was {{organized}} by the Institute of Urban Studies to discuss issues and matters related to Plan Winnipeg's Urban Limit Line. The Workshop {{was sponsored by the}} Manitoba Department of Urban Affairs and the Manitoba Home Builders' Association. The Institute of Urban Studies considered the Workshop to be timely for two reasons: i. Ever since the institution of the Urban Limit Line, it has been a contentious issue among the various actors involved (City officials, the Government of Manitoba, surrounding rural municipalities, and the housing and urban development industry). ii. The City of Winnipeg has initiated a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>Plan</b> Winnipeg. Since the Urban Limit Line is considered to be an important part of Plan Winnipeg, {{it would be useful to}} assess the issues identified, so that those involved in drawing up a new Plan Winnipeg could use the insights from the Workshop in formulating the new Plan.

40|$|North Carolina’s Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) {{was created}} in 1974 to “establish a {{comprehensive}} plan for the protection, preservation, orderly development, {{and management of the}} coastal area. ” One of CAMA’s key tools for managing coastal lands is a state-mandated land-use planning process, which tries to incentivize environmental protection through required analyses, planning exercises, and policy creation. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the degree to which the CAMA planning requirement encourages counties to think critically about their environmental resources and plan strategically for future development. This report evaluates the effectiveness of the CAMA planning requirement through two main analyses: a critical <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>plan</b> content and quality using case studies from Carteret, Dare, and Gates Counties; and a social survey to assess current opinions and usage of CAMA land-use plans by county officials and planning employees. Plan evaluation results showed that while counties excelled at data assessments of current infrastructure and environmental resources, the application of environmental analyses into responsible development planning fell short. Plan policies were typically weak and unenforceable, and rarely exceeded state and federal standards. Survey results communicated overall satisfaction with the planning requirement, and noted that the process does encourage counties to consider environmental resources but additional protection is still needed. This report concludes that the required environmental inventories and suitability analyses are the most beneficial aspects of the planning process, and encourages the State to dedicate future efforts towards expanding these elements and providing more localized data assistance and guidance...|$|E
40|$|PLAN Netherlands National Organisation has in {{coordination}} with PLAN International Headquarters commissioned an independent formative evaluation study to get systematic insight in the preconditions for appropriate functionality of Child Centred Community Development (CCCD) and to strengthen common understanding on CCCD. To review the general findings of the study (presented in the synthesis report), {{which are based on}} an extensive literature review of the materials available within Plan and within other organisations on child centred development and consultations with CCCD champions at various organisational levels within Plan, country studies were carried out in Kenya and Bangladesh. This report presents the findings of the country study in Bangladesh and forms {{an integral part of the}} synthesis report. Perspectives on CCCD and CCCD practise were looked at from four interrelated levels: Plan Bangladesh’s Country Office (exploring overall strategic outlook); one urban and one rural Programme Unit (looking at application of CCCD strategies in their particular settings); Plan partners (level of understanding and role of both NGO and government partners in developing and implementing CCCD, and; beneficiaries (CCCD practise and focus on understanding and effect of CCCD. Findings are based on a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>Plan</b> Bangladesh documents, groupwork, semi structured interviews and key informant interviews of Plan and partner staff at various organisational levels as well as field visits and discussions with CBOs and project beneficiaries. The findings are of a general nature and to some degree dependent on the sites visited and people met as a full depth analysis of CCCD would require more time of CCCD would require more time than the weeklong visit to Bangladesh allowed for...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the City of Dallas has {{witnessed}} {{a substantial increase in}} the level of citizen participation in land-use decisions. A little known provision of the Texas Civil Statutes allows cities to divide their town into 'Neighborhood Zoning Areas' to provide another method for citizen review of zoning applications. The purpose of this thesis is to examine present methods for soliciting citizen comments, examine the quality of land-use decisions and to determine successes and failures 'Neighborhood Councils' have had in three other cities. The literature concerning present neighborhood involvement in the zoning appeals process is sketchy and somewhat contradictory. Therefore, the experience of Portland, Oregon; Dayton, Ohio; and Washington, D. C. was analyzed to determine how well subordinate governmental units function in other cities. The information received in the case studies was limited due to several factors, but all three city staffs gave hearty endorsement to their particular systems. No negative consequences of using this particular system was noted. A <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>Plan</b> Commission voting records revealed that the quality of land-use decisions made through the zoning appeals process needs to be improved. Citizen attitudes were examined to determine whether a neighborhood advisory council would increase citizen input or merely interject an anti-development bias into the zoning appeals process. Three neighborhood representatives were interviewed and all demonstrated that they were capable of negotiating and possessed a good perspective of neighborhood planning issues. Creation of neighborhood advisory councils would possibly correct the existing imbalance between developer interests and neighborhood interests. Whether neighborhood advisory councils will ever be initiated in Dallas is difficult to predict. One recent City Council recommendation directed the staff to explore ways to encourage negotiations between neighborhoods and developers. A proposal to form neighborhood advisory councils could grow out of this recommendation. Department of Urban PlanningThesis (M. U. R. P. ...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{possibly}} {{the greatest threat}} facing human society in this century. The response to this challenge {{has been dominated by}} international negotiations for controlling greenhouse gas emissions. More recently there are efforts by the international community to engage other levels of governance in mitigation and adaptation response. While the framework for international action on climate change continues to evolve, there is mounting pressure from researchers to include cities as significant actors in the global climate change management strategy. Cities are centers of production and consumption in our society and as such will be crucial for global climate change management strategy. Despite these links, demands for consideration of climate change management issues in local policy making have remained a research rhetoric and have not yet translated into planning action. This gap between planning research and practice is probably due to lack of evidence based research on this issue. This study fills in this gap and provides empirical evidence supporting the key role of local development plans in climate change management. Specifically, in the first step, this research investigates the influence of local development plans on climate change mitigation by comparing change in carbon dioxide emissions in groups of cities with and without plans. Thereafter, climate change management capacity in local development plans is analyzed through policy analysis. Finally, this research study examines the effect of plan quality on the change in carbon dioxide emissions, while controlling for socio-economic, landscape and policy characteristics. Results of this study support the demands for using local development plans as tools for climate change management. This study identifies numerous planning policies in local development plans with potential to influence climate change management. The analysis also reveals wide variation in the quality of the climate change management policies. For example, policies related to site planning regulations and transportation are fairly detailed, whereas acquisition and incentive/disincentive tools are not. The detailed <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>plan</b> quality suggests that although development plans have the potential to significantly influence climate change, there is need for further improvement, especially of the overall plan implementation capacity. Finally, the research findings show that the quality of climate change management planning policies in local development plans {{have a significant impact on}} a communities? emissions. Communities with better plan quality had significantly lower increase in per-capita emissions over the period of analysis. The study also discovered significant effects of wealth, travel behavior, occupation base and state policy on the change in emissions. Based on the research findings this study recommends evolving integrated local development policies that focus on dual goals of climate change management and sustainable development. Further studies are recommended to examine the opportunities and challenges to use of local development plans for climate change management...|$|E

The scope {{is limited to}} providing a targeted check of bridges that {{are most likely to}} have grouting related corrosion problems based on a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>plans</b> and inspection notes. The project consisted of three phases: 1) <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>plans</b> and inspection reports of 40 post-tensioned bridges constructed prior to 2003, 2) selection of 10 bridges for a limited onsite inspection of the exterior of the bridge, and 3) invasive inspection of three select bridges. The bridges were selected to represent different bridge construction types to provide a spot check of the post-tensioned bridge inventory in Minnesota. One of the three bridges has corrosion and voids due to poor grouting, one has major corrosion problem related to construction issues (but appears to have good grout), and one showed no tendon corrosion or grouting problems during the invasive spot checks. Recommendations are given {{at the end of the}} report specific to the bridges that were investigated as well as for a general inspection plan for post-tensioned bridges in Minnesota.
