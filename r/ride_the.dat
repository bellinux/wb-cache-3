40|$|BackgroundPoint-of-decision prompts may be {{appropriate}} to promote walking, instead of using a mechanized mode of transport, such as a train, in airports. To our knowledge, no current studies describe the development of messages for prompts in this setting. MethodsIn-person {{interviews were conducted with}} 150 randomly selected airport travelers who <b>rode</b> <b>the</b> train to their departure gate. Travelers reported various reasons for <b>riding</b> <b>the</b> train to their gate. They were asked about messages that would encourage them to walk. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted for reasons for <b>riding</b> <b>the</b> train. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for messages to encourage walking to the departure gate. ResultsTravelers reported not knowing walking was an option (23. 8 %), seeing others <b>riding</b> <b>the</b> train (14. 4 %), and being afraid of getting lost (9. 2 %) as reasons for <b>riding</b> <b>the</b> train. Many indicated that directional signs and prompts promoting walking as exercise would encourage them to walk instead of <b>riding</b> <b>the</b> train. ConclusionsSome reasons for <b>riding</b> <b>the</b> train in an airport may be modifiable by installing point-of-decision prompts. Providing directional signs to travelers may prompt them to walk to their gate instead of <b>riding</b> <b>the</b> train. Similar prompts may also be considered in other community settings.

5|$|<b>Ride</b> <b>the</b> Lightning {{received}} {{positive response}} from music critics, {{who saw it}} as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg {{in the first half of}} 1985. The band performed at a few major music festivals, such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year contract and reissued the album. <b>Ride</b> <b>the</b> Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping six million copies in the United States. Many rock publications have ranked <b>Ride</b> <b>the</b> Lightning on their best album lists, saying it had a lasting impact on the genre.|$|E
