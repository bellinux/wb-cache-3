40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to evaluate grazing management systems for sheep and beef cattle in the hills and uplands, which meet environmental, market and economical objectives. These systems need to be developed to ensure that farming under the CAP reform regime will address issues of lower stocking densities and a better balance of cattle and sheep, which will improve economic viability by improving livestock quality and utilising natural resources more efficiently. The upland farm of Bronydd Mawr Research Station is an ideal upland research platform to conduct systems studies on a) Optimising stocking and husbandry of hill livestock to promote upland biodiversity, while making best use of the available resources; b) Producing high quality, naturally reared animals that meet consumer demands using environmentally sustainable and welfare-friendly systems; c) Utilising improved upland pastures in a cost-effective manner; and d) Minimising diffuse pollution effects. This project has four major objectives: 1) To study the long-term effects of grazing Molinia caerulea dominant semi-natural rough grazing during the summer months by cattle or sheep on plant species composition, structure and nutritive quality; 2) To study the effects of differing cattle to sheep ratios when mixed grazing of improved permanent pastures in the uplands; 3) To study the production and environmental consequences of removing cattle from improved permanent pasture to graze semi-natural <b>rough</b> <b>grazings</b> during the summer months; and 4) To create a global UK research platform for the study of upland systems. The research will be of major benefit to Defra Policy Division in indicating appropriate policies for the management of livestock production to sustain and enhance the environment in the LFAs, which account for almost half the agricultural land in the UK. This will underpin Defra?s stated policy aim of ensuring that consumers benefit from competitively priced food, which has been produced to high standards of safety, environmental care and animal welfare and from a sustainable, efficient food chain and to contribute to the well-being of rural communities. The research will also contribute to the continuing debate on the effects of the Single Farm Payment on livestock farming in the uplands. preprin...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{existence}} of an extensive literature on the morphology, autecology, utilisation, and eradication of Pteridium aquilinum, relatively little research has been done on the Pteridium-grassland ecosystem of Scottish <b>rough</b> <b>grazings.</b> This study is a systematic and semi-quantitative investigation of the influence of Pteridium competition on its associated vegetation and soils, based on field and soil laboratory techniques. It is postulated that the differential response of moorland species to varying degrees of bracken dominance and the modification of soil morphological and chemical characteristics by the dominant plant species is partly responsible for the well-known association of Pteridium aqutlinum with Festuca-Agrostis - brown forest soil ecosystems. This hypothesis is tested in the field in three contrasting upland environments in Scotland. The influence of varying densities of bracken on three facets of the vegetation - soil association is examined: (I) the characteristic particularly the biomass, of the ground vegetation as a whole (2) the species composition of the herb layer and (3) the morphological characteristics of the soil. The degree of dominance of bracken is defined in a semi-quantitative manner and correlated with indices of the vigour of the ground vegetation and its species composition. A classification of common dry moorland species, according to their response to Pterldlum competition is produced. The association of Ptertdlum aqutltnum with soils of brown forest soil morphology is studied and the importance of the rhizome system In modifying the physical characteristics of the soil and the distribution of organic matter in the profile demonstrated. The tendency of bracken to modify the morphological characteristics of podsolised soils is shown. Subsequent laboratory analysis substantiates the morphological evidence of the relationship between Pteridium-dominated vegetation and soil type. By revealing the differences in nutrient status between bracken soils and podsolised heath soils and the seasonal variation In nutrient levels, the efficiency of Pteridium in cycling nutrients through the ecosystem Is suggested. The ability of Pterldium to release phosphate from inorganic sources in the soil is demonstrated by laboratory experiment, anomalously high available phosphate levels in the subsoil of bracken soils having been revealed by routine analysis. Laboratory experiment also suggests that the modification of iron pans by Pteridium rhizomes may have a chemical as well as a physical component. The evidence of Pteridium's Influence on vegetation and soil characteristics allows preliminary comment to be made on the ecological significance of bracken eradication schemes...|$|E
