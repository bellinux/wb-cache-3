25|$|The ECAL is {{constructed}} from crystals of lead tungstate, PbWO4. This {{is an extremely}} dense but optically clear material, ideal for stopping high energy particles. Lead tungstate crystal is made primarily of metal and is heavier than stainless steel, but {{with a touch of}} oxygen in this crystalline form it is highly transparent and scintillates when electrons and photons pass through it. This means it produces light in proportion to the particle’s energy. These high-density crystals produce light in fast, short, well-defined photon bursts that allow for a precise, fast and fairly compact detector. It has a <b>radiation</b> <b>length</b> of χ0=0.89cm, and has a rapid light yield, with 80% of light yield within one crossing time (25ns). This is balanced however by a relatively low light yield of 30 photons per MeV of incident energy. The crystals used have a front size of 22mm×22mm and a depth of 230mm. They are set in a matrix of carbon fibre to keep them optically isolated, and backed by silicon avalanche photodiodes for readout.|$|E
