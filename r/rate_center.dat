50|$|Often, the {{rationale}} for a separate <b>rate</b> <b>center</b> is arbitrary or based on historical factors which no longer apply.

50|$|Local number {{portability}} allows a number {{to be moved}} to a different carrier or a different wire center within the same <b>rate</b> <b>center.</b> A landline provider typically will not allow a cross-town move to a different <b>rate</b> <b>center</b> under the same number at standard rates; possible alternatives include expensive foreign exchange service or a nomadic class of service such as voice over IP or a mobile phone.|$|E
5000|$|Incumbent local {{exchange}} carriers, {{such as the}} regional Bell operating companies, have typically resisted <b>rate</b> <b>center</b> consolidation because [...] "intraLATA toll calls", relatively short-haul US domestic long distance calls handled by the local carrier instead of an interexchange carrier, represent $2.7 billion per year for which they can bill subscribers. Often, incumbent carriers will threaten small communities with substantial increases in the monthly cost of an individual line if <b>rate</b> <b>center</b> consolidation expands local calling areas. The rare exceptions have been small groups of suburbs which each already have the same local calling area; one unified <b>rate</b> <b>center</b> would allow wire-line subscribers to keep existing numbers if they move {{from one of the}} communities to another.|$|E

50|$|The {{choice of}} <b>rate</b> <b>center</b> determines the inbound local calling {{area for a}} number, an {{important}} consideration in markets where local calls are flat-rated but toll calls are expensive. A number in area code 416 is in the Toronto <b>rate</b> <b>center,</b> so local to everything between Oakville and Ajax; the suburban rate centers are less valuable as one suburb to another {{on the other side}} of the same city (Markham to Malton, for example) is often a toll call.|$|E

50|$|One {{exception}} to this rule is the city of Elwood in Doniphan County, which retains the 913 area code while the remaining geographical balance of the county is under the 785 area code. This is because Elwood receives its dialtone from St. Joseph, Missouri which is covered by the Kansas City, Missouri LATA, located in area code 816. All bordering 816/913 <b>rate</b> <b>centers</b> have each other's area codes.|$|R
50|$|The 847 area code, located {{northwest}} of Chicago, {{had already been}} subjected to multiple area code splits and a proposed overlay area code 224 with 11-digit local calling was drawing public backlash; inefficient allocation meant that some providers had been holding 10,000 number blocks in <b>rate</b> <b>centers</b> where they had few clients or even no clients. A carrier with a few thousand clients scattered across multiple <b>rate</b> <b>centers</b> often had 50,000 allocated numbers. The state's telecommunications regulator, the Illinois Commerce Commission, {{at the urging of}} consumer advocates, pushed back against industry and FCC demands for a distributed overlay on 1-847 from 1999 to 2001 as half of the existing 1-847 numbers were not in use. The Citizens Utility Board, a Chicago-based consumer group, attempted to litigate against an arbitrary FCC requirement that calls within the same area code be dialed with the area code when 224 was introduced in 2002, but to no avail. A similar fight by New York state's Public Service Commission to maintain seven-digit dialing within the same area code (including calls from 212 to 212) was also moot.|$|R
50|$|Number pooling at the thousands-block {{level is}} just one of several {{approaches}} which can be used to conserve numbering resources. Other options include consolidating multiple rate centers into one (as much of the problem is caused by carriers needlessly requesting a prefix in each <b>rate</b> <b>center),</b> allowing carriers to use a single prefix in each LATA or local interconnect region to port existing numbers from all rate centers in that area, or even placing all the unused numbers in one <b>rate</b> <b>center</b> into a single available pool from which carriers port only what they need (as already exists for toll-free telephone numbers with the SMS/800 database and RespOrg structure). A block of 1,000 numbers per carrier, like the earlier allocation of 10,000 numbers per carrier in each <b>rate</b> <b>center,</b> is arbitrary. Local number portability could allow numbers to be assigned to carriers one at a time.|$|E

5000|$|In area codes where service {{providers}} {{are required to}} participate in thousands-block number pooling, the carrier is to return any blocks of 1,000 numbers which are more than 90% empty; an exemption applies for one block per <b>rate</b> <b>center</b> which the carrier must keep as an initial block or footprint block.|$|E

2500|$|In {{historical}} perspective, telecommunication terms {{have been}} used with different semantics over time. The term telephone exchange is often used synonymously with central office (CO), a Bell System term. Often, a central office {{is defined as a}} building used to house the inside plant equipment of potentially several telephone exchanges, each serving a certain geographical area. Such an area has also been referred to as the exchange. Central office locations may also be identified in North America as wire centers, designating a facility from which a telephone obtains dial tone.

50|$|As {{a senior}} for Atlanta, Georgia's Landmark Christian High School, Morris nearly {{averaged}} a triple-double at 23.0 ppg, 16.0 rpg and 8.0 bpg, which earned him McDonald's All-American Team status.

Morris strongly considered a jump straight to the NBA as well, but decided to spend at least a year in school. Kentucky won a late recruiting battle, after drawing Morris away from early favorite Georgia Tech. Morris, along with All-Americans Joe Crawford and Rajon Rondo, gave Kentucky the top-rated recruiting class in the nation. Also, in that same recruiting class was Kentucky teammate Ramel Bradley.|$|R
50|$|This {{has drawn}} the {{attention}} of state regulators in various US states including Colorado, Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Washington state.

5000|$|For billing purposes, many MTS base {{stations}} were {{identified with a}} very close-by <b>rate</b> <b>center</b> of an automatic exchange. However, {{if there was no}} nearby <b>rate</b> <b>center,</b> they became an [...] "Other Place Point". Phone companies typically identified these, and single points such as an individual telephone in a rural area, using a six-digit combination of 88T-XXX, where T is a digit from 6 to 9, and X is any digit 0-9. For example, Fox Lake, Yukon Territory, was 889-949. This combination would serve the same purpose as the NANP area code and central office code, with its own latitudinal-longitudinal coordinates, to allow a distance to be calculated for rating of a call. This coding system, which was in its zenith of usage during the 1980s and 1990s, was rendered unusable when the North American Numbering Plan administrator withdrew the 88X codes for future use as toll free (e.g. 1-800-) services.|$|E
5000|$|In {{countries}} {{other than}} the United States and Canada, the area codes generally determine {{the cost of a}} call, and calls within an area code and often a small group of adjacent or overlapping area codes are normally charged at a lower rate than outside the area code.This is not necessarily the case in the United States or Canada, where area codes cover a sufficiently large territory that different rates will apply within the same area code and toll rates may be determined by the distance between rate centers. The area code and central office prefix (NPA-NXX) define the <b>rate</b> <b>center,</b> which is assigned geographic coordinates V&H.

Then the ECB changed to a policy position of trying to bolster the external value of the euro. This paper seeks to explain these patterns of positions on the ECB’s external monetary policy. I argue that the ECB’s policy on the exchange rate is a function of its commitment to domes-tic price stability in the euro zone.
