5000|$|In 2008, {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis triggered {{the collapse of the}} Baltic property markets, causing some of the most severe <b>recessions</b> <b>in</b> Europe. In 2008, Latvia's GDP shrank by −4.6% and Estonia's −3.6% while Lithuania's slowed to 3.0%. As the crisis swept across Eastern and Central Europe the economic reversal intensified: Estonia's GDP dropped by -16.2% year-on-year, Latvia’s by −19.6% and Lithuania’s by −16.8%. By mid-2009, all three countries experienced one of the deepest <b>recessions</b> <b>in</b> the world.|$|R
50|$|The {{type and}} shape of <b>recessions</b> are distinctive. <b>In</b> the US, V-shaped, or short-and-sharp contractions {{followed}} by rapid and sustained recovery, occurred in 1954 and 1990-91; U-shaped (prolonged slump) in 1974-75, and W-shaped, or double-dip <b>recessions</b> <b>in</b> 1949 and 1980-82. Japan’s 1993-94 recession was U-shaped and its 8-out-of-9 quarters of contraction in 1997-99 {{can be described as}} L-shaped. Korea, Hong Kong and South-east Asia experienced U-shaped <b>recessions</b> <b>in</b> 1997-98, although Thailand’s eight consecutive quarters of decline should be termed L-shaped.|$|R

40|$|Following Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991) and Estrella and Mishkin (1995 a, b), {{we study}} {{the ability of}} the term {{structure}} to predict <b>recessions</b> <b>in</b> eight countries. The results are four-fold. First, the yield curve predicts future <b>recessions</b> <b>in</b> all countries. Second, term spreads forecast recessions as much as two years ahead. Third, while German and US spreads are frequently significant in the regressions for the other countries, the added information is limited, except in Japan and the United Kingdom. Fourth, while leading indicators contain information beyond that in term spreads, this information is only useful for forecasting <b>recessions</b> <b>in</b> the immediate future. These findings provide further evidence of the potential usefulness of term spreads as indicators for monetary policy purposes.

The models selected seem to be relevant to give early warnings of <b>recessions</b> <b>in</b> Brazil...|$|R
5|$|A <b>recession</b> <b>in</b> the 1930s {{was halted}} by {{increasing}} international tensions as World War II loomed; Sheffield's steel factories {{were set to}} work manufacturing weapons and ammunition for the war effort. As a result, the city became a target for bombing raids, the heaviest of which occurred on the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940, {{now known as the}} Sheffield Blitz. More than 660lives were lost and many buildings destroyed.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} major bailouts were pursued during the {{financial}} crisis, starting on 7 September with {{the announcement that}} the U.S. Government was to nationalise the two government-sponsored enterprises which oversaw most of the U.S. subprime mortgage market – Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

5|$|Argentina {{fell into}} a deep <b>recession</b> <b>in</b> the second half of 1998, {{triggered}} and then compounded by a series of adverse external shocks, which included low prices for agricultural commodities, the appreciation of the US dollar, to which the peso was pegged at par, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the LTCM crisis and the devaluation of the Brazilian real in January 1999. Argentina did not enjoy a rapid recovery, and the sluggishness of GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt.|$|E

We investigate whether a similar problem afflicts other developed economies, and whether technology is a culprit. We study recoveries from 71 <b>recessions</b> <b>in</b> 28 industries and 17 countries from 1970 - 2011. We find that though GDP recovered more slowly after recent recessions, employment did not. Industries that used more routine tasks, and those more exposed to robotization, did not recently experience slower employment recoveries. Finally, middle-skill employment did not recover more slowly after recent recessions, and this pattern was no different in routine-intensive industries...|$|R
5|$|Concurrently, Bangui {{also became}} the key centre {{for social and}} {{cultural}} activity in the region, when new institutions were established in the city. However, political turmoil in the country, rampant corruption, and the dictatorial rule of President Bokassa centred in the city, brought in economic <b>recession</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s exacerbated by a fall in international prices for its major exports. This caused impoverishment {{of the people and}} severe conflict, further compounded by refugees migrating from troubled neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|Construction stalled {{for several}} years as funding was {{diverted}} from the project during a <b>recession</b> <b>in</b> the early 1980s.

5|$|Fluor {{was founded}} in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company. It grew quickly, {{predominantly}} by building oil refineries, pipelines and other facilities for {{the oil and gas}} industry, at first in California, and then in the Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global <b>recession</b> <b>in</b> {{the oil and gas industry}} and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries.|$|E

A minor <b>recession</b> <b>in</b> 1921–22 caused {{a large number of}} customers to default on their payments, resulting in the repossession of their typewriters. The company opted not to borrow money and, in 1926, the board of directors voted to liquidate the company. Only one employee, Chester Nelson, was retained to oversee the company's liquidation.|$|E
5|$|The 1687 {{earthquake}} {{marked a}} turning point in the history of Lima as it coincided with a <b>recession</b> <b>in</b> trade, a reduction of silver production and economic competition by other cities such as Buenos Aires. To add to these problems, on October 28, 1746, a powerful earthquake severely damaged the city and destroyed Callao, forcing a massive rebuilding effort under Viceroy José Antonio Manso de Velasco. This disaster led to an intense devotion for an image of Christ called The Lord of the Miracles, which has been taken out in procession every October since 1746.|$|E
5|$|The Games were a major {{economic}} boon {{for the city}} which had fallen into its worst <b>recession</b> <b>in</b> 40 years following the collapse of both oil and grain prices in the mid-1980s. A report prepared for the city in January 1985 estimated the games would create 11,100 man-years of employment and generate C$450-million in salaries and wages. In its post-Games report, OCO'88 estimated the Olympics created C$1.4 billion in economic benefits across Canada during the 1980s, 70 percent within Alberta, {{as a result of}} capital spending, increased tourism and new sporting opportunities created by the facilities.|$|E

50|$|Reed saw rapid {{expansion}} during this period, punctuated by two <b>recessions.</b> <b>In</b> 1972 turnover doubled to £10m, with profits just under £1m, helped by rising demand for temporary workers and by inflation, which boosted salaries and thereby Reed’s commission.|$|R
5|$|The growth {{witnessed}} {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s was interrupted by another U.S. <b>recession</b> <b>in</b> 1981, in which silver, timber, and farm prices dropped. The period of decline for the city lasted into the 1990s and was also marked by a loss of many steady family-wage jobs in the manufacturing sector. Although this was a tough period, Spokane's economy had started to benefit from some measure of economic diversification; growing companies such as Key Tronic and other research, marketing, and assembly plants for technology companies helped lessen Spokane's dependence on natural resources.|$|E
5|$|As Prime Minister, Key led the Fifth National Government of New Zealand which entered {{government}} {{at the beginning of}} the late-2000s <b>recession</b> <b>in</b> 2008. In his first term, Key's government implemented a GST rise and personal tax cuts. In February 2011, a major earthquake in Christchurch, the nation's second largest city, significantly affected the national economy and the government formed the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority in response. In its second term, Key's government announced a policy of partial privatisation of five state-owned enterprises; while the policy was enacted, voters in a citizens-initiated referendum on the issue were 2 to 1 opposed to the policy. In foreign policy, Key announced the withdrawal of New Zealand Defence Force personnel from their deployment in the war in Afghanistan, signed the Wellington Declaration with the United States and pushed for more nations to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1927 {{economic}} indicators were signalling {{the onset of}} a <b>recession</b> <b>in</b> Australia. By 1929, the evidence was unavoidable that recession was becoming depression as a resulting of rapidly deteriorating international conditions. In that year, prices for Australian exports fell by nearly a third and GDP had fallen by 10%, with no attendant fall {{in the cost of}} living. Australia's debt now stood at £631 million the interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia's export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate. Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia's credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce's grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in the short term.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{adaptive}} learning and news shocks, operating in tandem, can generate business cycle dynamics that match the data. In doing so, {{this paper adopts}} expectational stability (“E-stability”) as a natural criterion for rationality: plausible equilibria should arise from an {{adaptive learning}} formulation where agents form forecasts from a correctly specified model whose parameters are updated in real time. In examining the model’s stability properties, I find that the rational expectations equilibrium (REE) is not learnable for calibrated parameter values capable of generating news-driven <b>recessions.</b> <b>In</b> particular, I uncover a tradeoff between E-stability, or learnability, and the model’s ability to produce realistic business cycles: REE associated with parameter values necessary for generating <b>recessions</b> <b>in</b> response to news shocks are not learnable, and parameter values that imply learnable REE cannot generate empirically plausible <b>recessions</b> <b>in</b> response to news shocks. This finding thus has implications on the plausibility of rational expectations solutions in business cycle models driven by news. Keywords: adaptive learning, E-stability, news-driven business cycle models I thank Bill Branch for many helpful discussions and comments. Fabio Milani, Gary Richardson, and seminar participants at U. C. Irvine also provided valuable feedback. 1...|$|R
