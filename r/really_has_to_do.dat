40|$|One of {{our colleagues}} 2 has {{characterized}} the milk price problem as having three as-pects: price volatility, price predictability, and price adequacy. Volatility <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the dramatic price swings that {{have become part of}} the dairy industry during the last 15 years (illustrated by the marked variation in the Class III price in Figure 1). High milk price years, like 2004 and 2007, are great recovery years if you can make it through the low price troughs, like 2002 and 2006. Price volatility might not be so bad if it were predictable—that is, if dairy producers and processors knew {{with a high level of}} certainty what prices were going to be well in advance. Then, business plans could be altered to accommodate the price volatility. Finally, price adequacy is an issue. If the average price is too low to cover long-run average costs, then a producer will be out of business regardless of the peaks and troughs...|$|E
40|$|Question: Why did {{you write}} this book? Answer: It {{seems to me that}} the purely {{syntactic}} approach to language structure has been exhausted. More and more people are becoming convinced that what was previously diagnosed as a syntactic phenomenon <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with semantics. However, this really is a difficult topic, and so I thought I should work out some theory. Question: Who should read this book? Answer: Anyone who is studying linguistics and has come across the term compositionality and wondered what on earth this means. (In other words: all those that have taken a course in semantics and want a second opinion [...] .) Question: Will I understand the book? Answer: I obviously require some mathematical sophistication. This is not intended for undergraduates students. But I do not presuppose much knowledge of mathematics. I give many examples, which you may also study first to see what I am trying to say. If you understand Montague Semantics, you have enough background. Question: Why is there so much mathematics in it? Answer: Because we want to be certain our answer is correct. Question: Why are there so few natural language examples? Answer: Because many people think they have invalidated a theory just because one example does not work. They’d say that example sentence Number 29 has another interpretation in such-and-such context. And that in the so-andso dialect it can mean yet another thing. But the theory is not about what exactly one particular sentence means. So I use formal examples to state my point, mostly. Question: But hasn’t Chomsky said that there is a fundamental difference between formal languages (which you use all the time) and natural languages?...|$|E

5000|$|The {{idea came}} really because I {{wanted to thank}} six key {{people who have been}} very closely {{connected}} to the 'Harry Potter' series, and these were people for whom a piece of jewellery wasn't going to cut it.

The secrets <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Devon being in on Chuck's spy life since late in season 2, and Devon always <b>has</b> trouble lying <b>to</b> her, but Ellie remains unaware {{of what they are}} keeping from her. She begins to snoop on Chuck—even enlisting Morgan, who shares suspicions about Chuck. Their suspicions are allayed when they catch Chuck sneaking around to make out with Hannah, but Ellie still takes note of Devon and Chuck being [...] "thick as thieves." ...|$|R

[...] These townhouses were characterised by their abandoning the modernist rules, the modification of the structural grid, the introduction of barrel vaults and historical references. As Nagle put it, [...] "a lot of it <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with history... The appreciation of history made us all much better architects." [...] Beeby's townhouse was strongly influenced by Palladio and the facade even sported a Serliana.|$|R

500|$|In March 2016, Marvel {{announced}} that Ms. Marvel would tie into the [...] "Civil War II" [...] storyline by releasing a promotional image illustrating a rift between Khan and Danvers. [...] "While [...] "Civil War II" [...] may have initiated this rift, we've {{known for some}} time that Kamala would eventually need to separate herself from her idols. Her journey centers around self-discovery and identity, and a part of that exploration includes separating yourself from those you put on pedestals. The rift between Carol and Kamala doesn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with right and wrong.

"For me, ('Damascus Road') {{was very}} autobiographical {{in a lot}} of ways - I can't say it was about a certain moment or anything, but I {{certainly}} have been at those crossroads before in my life", Carter said. [...] "… I've taken long periods of time off, and that <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with burning out and then getting really messed up in my personal life and my addiction stuff, and publicly just basically imploding.

I look at every day as a blessing that I'm even here".|$|R

2500|$|Of course, it's not {{actually}} necessary {{to exclude the}} entire line segment from z = 0 to ∞ to construct a domain in which Γ(z) is holomorphic. All we <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is puncture the plane at a countably infinite set of points {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. But a closed contour in the punctured plane might encircle {{one or more of}} the poles of Γ(z), giving a contour integral that is not necessarily zero, by the residue theorem. By cutting the complex plane we ensure not only that Γ(z) is holomorphic in this restricted domain– we also ensure that the contour integral of Γ over any closed curve lying in the cut plane is identically equal to zero.|$|R
