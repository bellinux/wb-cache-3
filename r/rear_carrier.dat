500|$|The {{engine and}} {{transmission}} were mounted {{together on the}} swingarm {{in front of the}} pivot axle {{at the bottom of the}} spine frame. The near-horizontal engine and transmission together as a unit formed a [...] "power egg" [...] style which would later be used by Benelli and Motobi. The tubular swingarm also served as the exhaust pipe. Behind the pivot axle, the swingarm, the reinforced rear fender, and the supports for the <b>rear</b> <b>carrier</b> formed a triangular structure which supported the rear spring. This suspension system allowed a long suspension travel and a soft spring rate. Test rides on the complete prototype began in December 1947 and showed that the combination of long travel and soft springs needed damping. Friction dampers were added.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{competition}} in the market, ever increasing demands of products and delivery of the quality product within committed dates forcing the manufacturers to involve newer and more optimized techniques in their production scheduling. This technique either involves costly Automation and Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) or the techniques forcing on elimination of unnecessary and unproductive operation (i. e. motion) during the production. An assembly line is designed by determining the sequences of operations for manufacture of each component {{as well as the}} final product. In this paper, a case study at one of leading tractor manufacturing company in India for one of its production operation i. e. assembly of <b>Rear</b> Axle <b>Carrier</b> (Transmission System) of tractor is presented using the technique of time and motion study.

50|$|The Honda X8R-S {{also known}} as the Honda SZX50 is a sport moped {{manufactured}} by the Honda Motor Company, from 1998 to 2003. There are two versions of the X8R: the X8R-S, the sport road version; and the X8R-X, the dual purpose version with different wheels, front fender, <b>rear</b> <b>carrier</b> and color scheme. The engine used is that seen in various Honda mopeds of the period but modified to provide more sporting performance. The machine has a full instrument panel (speedometer, fuel gauge, necessary instruments) an electric starter as well as kick start, automatic choke and a six-litre tank.|$|E

50|$|The rear {{suspension}} was fully independent, with double wishbone and radius arm configuration, incorporating anti-squat characteristics. The car was fitted with Armstrong adjustable dampers and spring platform adjustment. Coil springs were used. A separate adjustable anti-roll bar {{was included in}} the suspension. Outboard drive-shafts were hollowed out to reduce unsprung weight. <b>Rear</b> hub <b>carriers</b> were made of magnesium cast. The suspension operates entirely on adjustable rod-ends with provision for toe-in and camber adjustments.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} double-wishbone front suspension {{was replaced}} with a dual joint multilink design, with an all-electric system. To increase rigidity and lower unsprung weight, forged aluminum is now used for the suspension links, front steering knuckles, and <b>rear</b> hub <b>carriers.</b> along with a single-piece hollow die-cast aluminum front subframe with machined mounting points, and {{approximately half of the}} body uses high-tensile steel. Overall the amount of laser welding has been doubled compared to the previous model.|$|R

5000|$|Norton {{continued}} {{production of}} their 3.5 hp and Big 4 singles {{well into the}} war period, though in November 1916 the Ministry of Munitions issued an order that no further work on motor cycles or cars would be allowed from 15 November 1916 without a permit. By this time most motor cycle companies were already either producing munitions (or aircraft parts), or devoted to the export trade. Norton were involved in exporting and earlier that year had announced a new 'Colonial Model' of their 633cc Big 4. This featured an increase in ground clearance from 4.25" [...] to 6.5", by altering the frame, larger tank, greater clearance on mudguards, and a sturdy <b>rear</b> <b>carrier.</b> The engine was unaltered, and transmission was via a Sturmey-Archer 3-speed gearbox.|$|E

50|$|The two tire {{carriers}} {{bring new}} tires over the pit wall and guide {{them onto the}} studs. They must stay {{in contact with the}} old tires when they are being taken to the wall. The front tire carrier is usually responsible for pulling the front fenders away from the tire if necessary. He may also be responsible for cleaning and adding or removing tape to/from the grille during a pit stop in order to adjust front-end downforce and engine temperatures. The <b>rear</b> tire <b>carrier</b> is usually responsible for making any necessary adjustments to the rear track bar and/or wedge.|$|R

50|$|A factory race kit was {{available}} for the TS90 which consisted of an expansion chamber,light piston and rings,carburetor and harder (colder range) plug and head which increased the size to 100cc. In the North American market a 175cc race kit {{was available}} for the TS185. The 175 size was to match an established class. It consisted of an expansion chamber, new cylinder and head,piston,thin rings,larger carburetor and much lower gearing. Different gearing {{was available for}} most models. The TF model (Mud Bug) {{was developed in the}} early 1970s and sold mainly in New Zealand and Australia. The TF series was made in three sizes; 100 cc, 125 cc and 185 cc engines. These bikes were based on the ER range. The TF125 is still in production. It has left-and-right side stands with large bases, a large <b>rear</b> <b>carrier,</b> headlight and lever protection, a single seat, bash plate, large mud flaps and knobby tyres.|$|E
50|$|The sport/touring bicycle {{is a very}} {{lightweight}} touring bike {{fitted with}} lighter wheels and narrower 25-28 mm (1 - 1.125-inch) tires. It may also {{be described as a}} road racing bike fitted with heavier tires and slightly more relaxed frame geometry (though still quicker than the average road touring bike). It is designed as a fast-handling, responsive and quick day touring machine. As such, it is intended to carry only the rider and very light loads, such as encountered in credit card touring, where riders typically carry little more than a pocketbook and credit cards to book overnight lodging at any handy motel, pension, or bed-and-breakfast while on a journey. Gearing is often a mix of closely spaced ratios for speed, combined with a few low gears for long climbs. Sport/touring bikes may sometimes have provisions for mounting slim fenders and a <b>rear</b> <b>carrier</b> or pannier rack, though in the interests of weight savings and quicker handling, most do not.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] Honda SH50 is a , air-cooled, two stroke, single cylinder, scooter style, {{restricted}} moped {{manufactured by}} the Honda Motor Company between 1984 and 2006, with substantial revisions for the 1996 model year. It {{was equipped with}} continuously variable automatic transmission, (Honda V-Matic transmission) together with both electric and kick start, automatic choke and capacitor discharge electronic ignition. Brakes were drum front and rear, (disc front on later models) operated pedal-cycle style by two handlebar levers. The early models had some resemblance to Honda's C50/70/90 Super Cub range with a similar shape, dual seat and <b>rear</b> <b>carrier,</b> but with a scooter type floor, unlike the P series of mopeds such as the Honda PC50 or the Honda Express N series, which had cycle style construction. The SH50 was {{also known as the}} City Express and in some markets, as the Scoopy. All models had cycle type wheels as against the smaller wheels of later 50cc scooter style mopeds. The battery, fuel tank and two-stroke-oil reservoir were contained under the seat. Electrics were 12 volt and a handlebar mounted binnacle, which effectively formed part of the front bodywork, contained basic instrumentation and warning lights.|$|E
5000|$|The 1969 Universal {{offered a}} [...] "462" [...] package. It was a limited {{production}} model that featured the V6 engine, front bucket seats and a rear bench, roll bar, heavy-duty frame and springs, a locking differential, oil pan skid plate, <b>rear</b> swing-out tire <b>carrier,</b> full wheel covers, ammeter and oil pressure gauges, padded visors were optional.|$|R
5000|$|For the '87+ model, the {{swingarm}} {{design was}} changed to a more [...] "beefy" [...] design after cracking / breaking issues with the 85-86 swingarm design. Clearly, the Suzuki engineers underestimated how hard their customers could ride their product. However, the '87+ swingarm will mount to the 85-86 frame with some other minor equipment swap (i.e. rear shock, link). The '87+ <b>rear</b> axle <b>carrier</b> includes forward-reverse slide chain tensioning rather than the 85-86's rotary tensioning method. The '87+ carrier housing slides forward and reverse and then is {{held in place by}} four vertical bolts and two rear horizontal bolts whereas the 85-86 carrier was held with a clamp or pinch design.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{apparent}} attention to weight by engineers, {{it came with}} many aluminum parts: swing arm, <b>rear</b> axle <b>carrier,</b> engine cases, front spindles, rear shock link. But the overall advantage in weight (compared to most other quads) is the simplicity of design. The '85 and '86 Quadracers are known as the lightest production full size race quads ever built, tipping the scales at only 293 lbs dry making them similar to the 250cc two stroke race three wheelers of that era. (They were actually lighter than the Yamaha Tri-Z, slightly heavier than the Kawasaki Tecate 3, and identical in weight to the Honda ATC250R.) ...|$|R
