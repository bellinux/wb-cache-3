40|$|Employee {{engagement}} {{has taken}} over the corporate world. Whether it is the media, consulting firms, business leaders or human resources, everyone is talking about it. Despite the buzz in the corporate world and millions of dollars pumped into the industry, employee engagement has remained relatively unchanged and our comprehension of it is hazy. Examining the concept of employee engagement from conceptualization to present day helps provide a solid understanding of its foundation and where major evolutionary failings occurred. Prompted by Gallup’s takeover of the concept – from packaging, selling, measuring and intervening – the essence of employee engagement has been lost in overdrive and is now focused on statistics rather than people. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the major flaws in the current state of employee engagement using its past as a basis of <b>restoring</b> <b>viability</b> to the concept...|$|E
40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae uses G protein-coupled {{receptor}}s for signal transduction. We {{show that}} a fusion protein between the alpha-factor receptor (Ste 2) and the Galpha subunit (Gpa 1) transduces the signal efficiently in yeast cells devoid of the endogeneous STE 2 and GPA 1 genes. To evaluate the function of different domains of Galpha, a chimera between the N-terminal region of yeast Gpa 1 and the C-terminal region of rat Gsalpha has been constructed. This chimeric Gpa 1 -Gsalpha is capable of <b>restoring</b> <b>viability</b> to haploid gpa 1 Delta cells, but signal transduction is prevented. This is consistent with evidence showing that the C-terminus of the homologous Galpha is required for receptor-G protein recognition. Surprisingly, a fusion protein between Ste 2 and Gpa 1 -Gsalpha is able to transduce the signal efficiently. It appears, therefore, that the C-terminus of Galpha is mainly responsible for bringing the G protein into the close proximity of the receptor's intracellular domains, thus ensuring efficient coupling, rather than having a particular role in transmitting the signal. To confirm this conclusion, we show that two proteins interacting with each other (such as Snf 1 and Snf 4, or Ras and Raf), each of them fused either to the receptor or to the chimeric Galpha, allow efficient signal transduction...|$|E
40|$|We {{reformulate}} {{the traditional}} AS-AD growth {{model of the}} Neoclassical Synthesis (stage I) with a Taylor policy rule replacing the conventional LM-curve, with gradually adjusting wages as well as prices, and with perfect foresight on current inflation rates and an adaptively revised notion of an inflationary climate in which the economy is operating. We compare this approach with the New Keynesian approach, the Neoclassical Synthesis, stage II, with staggered price and wage setting and find various common components, yet with radically different dynamic implications due to our treatment of the forward-looking part of our wage-price spiral. We show for a system estimate of our model that it implies qualitatively local asymptotic stability and when its estimated form is simulated in response to isolated shocks strongly damped business fluctuations, due to a stable interaction of goods market dynamics with the interest rate policy of the central bank and due to a normal working of a real-wage feedback chain. These results are however endangered – leading in fact to economic breakdown – {{when there is a}} global floor to money wage inflation rates. In this case, the return of some money wage flexibility in deep depressions is of help in <b>restoring</b> <b>viability</b> of the model, thereby even avoiding explosive dynamics and the collapse of the economy. This situation leads to viable, but complex business fluctuations.

40|$|Stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) is an {{essential}} component of the histone pre-mRNA processing machinery. SLBP protein expression was examined during Drosophila development by using transgenes expressing hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged proteins expressed from the endogenous Slbp promoter. Full-length HA-dSLBP complemented a Slbp null mutation, demonstrating that it was fully functional. dSLBP protein accumulates throughout the cell cycle, in contrast to the observed restriction of mammalian SLBP to S phase. dSLBP is located in both nucleus and cytoplasm in replicating cells, but it becomes predominantly nuclear during G 2. dSLBP is present in mitotic cells and is down-regulated in G 1 when cells exit the cell cycle. We determined whether mutation at previously identified phosphorylation sites, T 120 and T 230, affected the ability of the protein to <b>restore</b> <b>viability</b> and histone mRNA processing to dSLBP null mutants. The T 120 A SLBP <b>restored</b> <b>viability</b> and histone pre-mRNA processing. However, the T 230 A mutant, located in a conserved TPNK sequence in the RNA binding domain, did not <b>restore</b> <b>viability</b> and histone mRNA processing in vivo, although it had full activity in histone mRNA processing in vitro. The T 230 A protein is concentrated in the cytoplasm, suggesting that it is defective in nuclear targeting, and accounting for its failure to function in histone pre-mRNA processing in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{disruption}} of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae C- 4 sterol methyl oxidase ERG 25 gene leads to sterol auxotrophy. We have characterized a suppression system that requires two mutations to <b>restore</b> <b>viability</b> to this disrupted strain. One suppressor mutation is erg 11, which is blocked in 14 α-demethylation of lanosterol and is itself an auxotroph. The second suppressor mutation required is either slu 1 or slu 2 (suppressor of lanosterol utilization). These mutations are leaky versions of HEM 2 and HEM 4, respectively; addition of exogenous hemin reverses the suppressing effects of slu 1 and slu 2. Suppression of erg 25 by erg 11 slu 1 (or erg 11 slu 2) results in a slow-growing strain in which lanosterol, the first sterol in the pathway, accumulates. This result indicates that endogenously synthesized lanosterol can substitute for ergosterol and support growth. In the triple mutants, all but 1 (ERG 6) of the 13 subsequent reactions of the ergosterol pathway are inactive. Azole antibiotics (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, and itraconazole) widely used to combat fungal infections are known {{to do so by}} inhibiting the ERG 11 gene product, the 14 α-demethylase. In this investigation, we demonstrate that treatment of the sterol auxotrophs erg 25 slu 1 or erg 25 slu 2 with azole antibiotics paradoxically <b>restores</b> <b>viability</b> to these strains in the absence of sterol supplementation via the suppression system we have described...|$|R

To see whether the same spectrum of target proteins can be productively folded by the double-ring prokaryotic chaperonin GroEL-GroES and its single-ring human mitochondrial homolog, Hsp 60 -Hsp 10, we expressed the latter in an Escherichia coli strain engineered so that the groE operon is under strict regulatory control. We found that expression of Hsp 60 -Hsp 10 <b>restores</b> <b>viability</b> to cells that no longer express GroEL-GroES, formally demonstrating that Hsp 60 -Hsp 10 can carry out all essential in vivo functions of GroEL-GroES...|$|R
40|$|Nucleotide 1093 in domain II of Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA {{is part of}} {{a highly}} conserved {{structure}} historically referred to as the GTPase center. The mutation G 1093 A was previously shown to cause readthrough of nonsense codons and high temperature-conditional lethality. Defects in translation termination caused by this mutation have also been demonstrated in vitro. To identify sites in 23 S rRNA that may be functionally associated with the G 1093 region during termination, we selected for secondary mutations in 23 S rRNA that would compensate for the temperature-conditional lethality caused by G 1093 A. Here we report the isolation and characterization of such a secondary mutation. The mutation is a deletion of two consecutive nucleotides from helix 73 in domain V, close to the peptidyltransferase center. The deletion results in a shortening of the CGCG sequence between positions 2045 and 2048 by two nucleotides to CG. In addition to <b>restoring</b> <b>viability</b> in the presence of G 1093 A, this deletion dramatically decreased readthrough of UGA nonsense mutations caused by G 1093 A. An analysis of the amount of mutant rRNA in polysomes revealed that this decrease cannot be explained by an inability of G 1093 A-containing rRNA to be incorporated into polysomes. Furthermore, the deletion was found to cause UGA readthrough on its own, thereby implicating helix 73 in termination for the first time. These results also indicate the existence of a functional connection between the G 1093 region and helix 73 during translation termination...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Galactose is a commonmonosaccharide {{that can}} be {{utilized}} by all living organisms via the activities of three main en-zymes {{that make up the}} Leloir pathway: GalK, GalT, and GalE. In Bacillus subtilis, the absence of GalE causes sensitivity to exog-enous galactose, leading to rapid cell lysis. This effect {{can be attributed to the}} accumulation of toxic galactose metabolites, since the galEmutant is blocked in the final step of galactose catabolism. In a screen for suppressor mutants <b>restoring</b> <b>viability</b> to a galE null mutant in the presence of galactose, we identified mutations in sinR, which is the major biofilm repressor gene. These mutations caused an increase in the production of the exopolysaccharide (EPS) component of the biofilmmatrix. We propose that UDP-galactose is the toxic galactose metabolite and that it is used in the synthesis of EPS. Thus, EPS production can func-tion as a shunt mechanism for this toxic molecule. Additionally, we demonstrated that galactose metabolism genes play an es-sential role in B. subtilis biofilm formation and that the expressions of both the gal and eps genes are interrelated. Finally, we propose that B. subtilis and other members of the Bacillus genus may have evolved to utilize naturally occurring polymers of galactose, such as galactan, as carbon sources. IMPORTANCE Bacteria switch from unicellular to multicellular states by producing extracellular matrices that contain exopoly-saccharides. In such aggregates, known as biofilms, bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics. This makes biofilms a serious problem in clinical settings. The resilience of biofilmsmakes them very useful in industrial settings. Thus, understanding the production of biofilmmatrices is an important problem inmicrobiology. In studying the synthesis of the biofilmmatrix of Ba...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} was to {{determine}} the potential of increased chitin content as a mechanism of resistance to caspofungin in different fungal pathogens. C. albicans wild-type cells were pre-grown with a combination of CaCl 2 and CFW prior to caspofungin treatment. This result sin a three-fold increase in cell wall chitin. Wild-type cells, which had elevated chitin content, were less susceptible to caspofungin. Priming cells to activated chitin synthesis was also able to compensate for the loss of the normally essential CaCHS 1, through formation of three novel forms of salvage septa. In the absence of both Ca Chs 1 and Ca Chs 3, which are typically involved in septum formation, the class I chitin synthases, Ca Chs 2 and Ca Chs 8, could be stimulated to synthesise a proximally offset salvage septum. When Ca Chs 3 was the only remaining chitin synthase, treatment with CaCl 2 and CFW, {{led to the formation of}} thick chitin-rich salvage septa. Ca Chs 2 and Ca Chs 3 could be stimulated by treatment with CaCl 2 and CFW to synthesise a thin salvage septum similar to the septum of wild-type cells. All three salvage septa were capable of <b>restoring</b> <b>viability</b> and cell division in C. albicans. The compensatory increase in chitin content in response to caspofungin treatment was not specific to C. albicans because clinical isolates of C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. guilliermondii and the filamentous fungus, A. fumigatus, also demonstrated an increase in chitin content after treatment with caspofungin. Isolates of C. glabrata and C. krusei showed no change in chitin content when exposed to caspofungin. The results of this thesis highlight the potential for using chitin synthase inhibitors in combination therapy with the echinocandins. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Metazoan genomes contain many ultra-conserved {{elements}} (UCEs), long sequences identical between distant species. In {{this study}} we identified UCEs in drosophilid and vertebrate species with a similar level of phylogenetic divergence measured at protein-coding regions, and demonstrated that both the length and number of UCEs are larger in vertebrates. The proportion of non-exonic UCEs declines in distant drosophilids whilst an opposite trend was observed in vertebrates. We generated a set of 2, 126 Sophophora UCEs by merging elements identified in several drosophila species and compared these to the eutherian UCEs identified in placental mammals. In contrast to vertebrates, the Sophophora UCEs are depleted around transcription start sites. Analysis of 52, 954 P-element, piggyBac and Minos insertions in the D. melanogaster genome revealed depletion of the P-element and piggyBac insertions {{in and around the}} Sophophora UCEs. We examined eleven fly strains with transposon insertions into the intergenic UCEs and identified associated phenotypes in five strains. Four insertions behave as recessive lethals, and in one case we observed a suppression of the marker gene within the transgene, presumably by silenced chromatin around the integration site. To confirm the lethality is caused by integration of transposons we performed a phenotype rescue experiment for two stocks and demonstrated that the excision of the transposons from the intergenic UCEs <b>restores</b> <b>viability.</b> Sequencing of DNA after the transposon excision in one fly strain with the <b>restored</b> <b>viability</b> revealed a 47 bp insertion at the original transposon integration site suggesting that the natur...|$|R
40|$|DNA ligase I (Lig I) has {{key roles}} in {{chromosomal}} DNA replication and repair in the eukaryotic cell nucleus. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the Lig I enzyme Cdc 9 p is also required for mitochondrial DNA replication and repair. In this report, dual nuclear–mitochondrial localization is demonstrated to be a {{property of the}} essential Lig I enzyme Cdc 17 from the distantly related fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Expression of nuclear and mitochondrial forms of Cdc 17 from separate genes shows that, whereas expression of either protein alone is insufficient to <b>restore</b> <b>viability</b> to cells lacking endogenous Cdc 17, co-expression <b>restores</b> full <b>viability.</b> In the nucleus, Lig I interacts with the sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) via a conserved PCNA interacting sequence motif known as a PIP box.

40|$|TOM 22 is an {{essential}} mitochondrial outer membrane protein required for the import of precursor proteins into the organelles. The amino-terminal 84 amino acids of TOM 22 extend into the cytosol and include 19 negatively and 6 positively charged residues. This region of the protein is thought to interact with positively charged presequences on mitochondrial preproteins, presumably via electrostatic interactions. We constructed a series of mutant derivatives of TOM 22 in which 2 to 15 of the negatively charged residues in the cytosolic domain were changed to their corresponding amido forms. The mutant constructs were transformed into a sheltered Neurospora crassa heterokaryon bearing a tom 22 ::hygromycin R disruption in one nucleus. All constructs <b>restored</b> <b>viability</b> to the disruption-carrying nucleus and gave rise to homokaryotic strains containing mutant tom 22 alleles. Isolated mitochondria from three representative mutant strains, including the mutant carrying 15 neutralized residues (strain 861), imported precursor proteins at efficiencies comparable to those for wild-type organelles. Precursor binding studies with mitochondrial outer membrane vesicles from several of the mutant strains, including strain 861, revealed only slight differences from binding to wild-type vesicles. Deletion mutants lacking portions of the negatively charged region of TOM 22 can also <b>restore</b> <b>viability</b> to the disruption-containing nucleus, but mutants lacking the entire region cannot. Taken together, {{these data suggest that}} an abundance of negative charges in the cytosolic domain of TOM 22 is not essential for the binding or import of mitochondrial precursor proteins; however, other features in the domain are required...|$|R

Mutations in Drosophila ena were discovered as dominant genetic suppressors of mutations in the Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl), suggesting that Ena and Abl function in the same pathway or process. We have identified six tyrosine residues on Ena that are phosphorylated by Abl in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of these phosphorylation sites to phenylalanine partially impaired the ability of Ena to <b>restore</b> <b>viability</b> to ena mutant animals, indicating that phosphorylation is required for optimal Ena function. Phosphorylation of Ena by Abl inhibited the binding of Ena to SH 3 domains in vitro, suggesting that one effect of Ena phosphorylation may be to modulate its association with other proteins...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial toxin-antitoxin protein pairs (TA pairs) encode a toxin protein, which poisons cells by binding and {{inhibiting}} {{an essential}} enzyme, and an antitoxin protein, which binds the toxin and <b>restores</b> <b>viability.</b> We took {{an approach that}} did not rely on sequence homology to search for unidentified TA pairs in the genome of Escherichia coli K- 12.

Mutant dmiro animals exhibit defects in locomotion and die prematurely. Mitochondria in dmiro mutant muscles and neurons are abnormally distributed. Instead of being transported into axons and dendrites, mitochondria accumulate in parallel rows in neuronal somata. Mutant neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) lack presynaptic mitochondria, but neurotransmitter release and acute Ca 2 + buffering is only impaired during prolonged stimulation. Neuronal, but not muscular, expression of dMiro in dmiro mutants <b>restored</b> <b>viability,</b> transport of mitochondria to NMJs, {{the structure of}} synaptic boutons, the organization of presynaptic microtubules, {{and the size of}} postsynaptic muscles. In addition, gain of dMiro function causes an abnormal accumulation of mitochondria in distal synaptic boutons of NMJs.

Here we ask whether phosphorylation of survivin by aurora B kinase regulates its function during mitosis in vivo. Using a phospho-specific antibody we first establish that survivin is phosphorylated at T 117 during mitosis and is present at the midbody during cytokinesis. Next we use two independent RNAi complementation approaches to investigate threonine 117 mutants in survivin depleted cells. Our data suggest that while non-phosphorylatable survivin, survivinT 117 A, can substitute for the wild type protein, a phosphomimic, survivinT 117 E cannot <b>restore</b> <b>viability,</b> nor can it complement chromosome congression and spindle checkpoint defects that arise due to depletion of endogenous survivin. Fluorescence imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis suggest that the phosphomimic has reduced affinity for centromeres compared with the non-phosphorylatable form.

Herein, we demonstrate that Br− is a required cofactor for peroxidasin-catalyzed formation of sulfilimine crosslinks, a posttranslational modification essential for tissue development and architecture {{found within the}} collagen IV scaffold of basement membranes (BMs). Bromide, converted to hypobromous acid, forms a bromosulfonium-ion intermediate that energetically selects for sulfilimine formation. Dietary Br deficiency is lethal in Drosophila, whereas Br replenishment <b>restores</b> <b>viability,</b> demonstrating its physiologic requirement. Importantly, Br-deficient flies phenocopy the developmental and BM defects observed in peroxidasin mutants and indicate a functional connection between Br−, collagen IV, and peroxidasin. We establish that Br− is required for sulfilimine formation within collagen IV, an event critical for BM assembly and tissue development. Thus, bromine is an essential trace element for all animals, and its deficiency may be relevant to BM alterations observed in nutritional and smoking-related disease. PaperFlic...|$|R

This multistep process is initiated by the resection of the broken DNA ends by a multisubunit helicase-nuclease complex exemplified by Escherichia coli RecBCD, Bacillus subtilis AddAB, and newly discovered Mycobacterium tuberculosis AdnAB. Here we show that in Streptomyces, neither recBCD nor addAB homologues could be detected. The only putative helicase-nuclease-encoding genes identified were homologous to M. tuberculosis adnAB genes. These genes are conserved as a single copy in all sequenced genomes of Streptomyces. The disruption of adnAB in Streptomyces ambofaciens and Streptomyces coelicolor could not be achieved unless an ectopic copy was provided, indicating that adnAB is essential for growth. Both adnA and adnB genes were shown to be inducible in response to DNA damage (mitomycin C) and to be independently transcribed.

A single domain of eEF 1 A is proposed to bind actin, aa-tRNA and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eEF 1 Bα. We show that eEF 1 Bα {{has the ability}} to disrupt eEF 1 A-induced actin organization. Mutational analysis of eEF 1 Bα F 163, which binds in this domain, demonstrates effects on growth, eEF 1 A binding, nucleotide exchange activity, and cell morphology. These phenotypes can be partially restored by an intragenic W 130 A mutation. Furthermore, the combination of F 163 A with the lethal K 205 A mutation <b>restores</b> <b>viability</b> by drastically reducing eEF 1 Bα affinity for eEF 1 A. This also results in a consistent increase in actin bundling and partially corrected morphology.

Here we describe a link between SPB duplication and targeted translation control. When insertion of the newly formed SPB into the nuclear envelope fails, the SESA network comprising the GYF domain protein Smy 2, the translation inhibitor Eap 1, the mRNA-binding protein Scp 160 and the Asc 1 protein, specifically inhibits initiation of translation of POM 34 mRNA that encodes an integral membrane protein of the nuclear pore complex, while having no impact on other mRNAs. In response to SESA, POM 34 mRNA accumulates in the cytoplasm and is not targeted to the ER for cotranslational translocation of the protein. Reduced level of Pom 34 is sufficient to <b>restore</b> <b>viability</b> of mutants with defects in SPB duplication. We suggest that the SESA network provides a mechanism by which cells can regulate the translation of specific mRNAs.

A functional homologue of SSD 1 from the human pathogen Candida albicans was isolated on the basis of its ability to <b>restore</b> <b>viability</b> at the restrictive temperature in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae swi 4 ssdl-d strain. The C. albicans gene, designated CaSSD 1, encodes a 1262 aa protein which has 47 % identity overall to S. cerevisiae SSDI as well as significant identity to Schizosaccharomyces pombe dis 3 and sts 5 products. It is shown that CaSSD 1 expression is constitutive through the mitotic cell cycle, which is consistent with a role for the protein in cell growth. CaSSD 1 rescues the swiP defect in an ssd 1 -d background when expressed from its own promoter on a single-copy plasmid and under the same conditions can rescue mutations in genes encoding protein phosphatase type 2 A catalytic subunits.

40|$|The {{mutations}} of the Abruptex locus in Drosophila melanogaster {{fall into}} three categories. There are recessive lethal alleles and viable alleles. The latter {{can be divided}} into suppressors and nonsuppressors of Notch mutations. The recessive lethals are lethal in heterozygous combination with Notch. As a rule the recessive lethals are lethal also in heterozygous combination with the viable alleles. Heterozygous combinations of certain viable alleles are also lethal. In such heterozygotes, one heteroallele is a suppressor of Notch and the other is a nonsuppressor. Other heterozygous combinations of viable alleles are viable and have an Abruptex phenotype. The insertion of the wild allele of the Abruptex locus as an extra dose (carried by a duplication) into the chromosomal complement of the fly fully <b>restores</b> the <b>viability</b> of the otherwise lethal heterozygotes if two viable alleles are involved. The extra wild allele also <b>restores</b> the <b>viability</b> of heterozygotes in which a lethal and a suppressor allele are present. If, however, a lethal and a nonsuppressor are involved, the wild allele only partly <b>restores</b> the <b>viability,</b> and the effect of the wild allele is weakest if two lethal alleles are involved. It seems likely that of the viable alleles the suppressors of Notch are hypermorphic and the nonsuppressors are hypomorphic. The lethal alleles share properties of both types, and are possibly antimorphic mutations. It is suggested that the locus is responsible for a single function which, however, consists of two components. The hypermorphic mutations are defects of the one component and the hypomorphic mutations of the other. In heterozygotes their cumulative action leads to decreased viability. The lethal alleles are supposed to be defects of the function as a whole. The function controlled by the locus might be a regulative function...|$|R

Furthermore, the presence of endogenous homologues with a CXXC motif in the thioredoxin-like domain is required for suppression of a pdi 1 deletion by EUG 1 (which contains two CXXS active site motifs). This underlines the essentiality of protein disulfide isomerase-catalyzed oxidation. Most mutant combinations show defects in carboxypeptidase Y folding as well as in glycan modification. There are, however, no significant effects on ER-associated protein degradation in the various protein disulfide isomerase-deleted strains...|$|R
40|$|Misregulation of the {{evolutionarily}} conserved GTPase Ran in fission yeast {{results in}} defects in several cellular processes in {{cells that are}} competent for nucleocytoplasmic protein transport. These results suggest that transport is neither the only nor the primary Ran-dependent process in living cells. The ability of Ran to independently regulate multiple cellular processes in vivo is demonstrated by showing that (i) eight different transport-competent RanGEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) mutants have defects in mitotic spindle formation; (ii) the RanGEF temperature-sensitive mutant pim 1 -d 1 has abnormal actin ring structures at the septum. Overexpression of Imp 2 p, which specifically destabilizes these structures, <b>restores</b> <b>viability.</b> (iii) Ran-dependent processes differ in their requirements for active Ran in vivo. Microtubule function, cytokinesis, and nuclear envelope structure are the Ran-dependent processes most sensitive {{to the amount of}} Ran protein in the cell, whereas nucleocytoplasmic protein transport is the most robust. Therefore, the ability of Ran from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to independently regulate multiple cellular processes may reflect differences in its interactions with the binding proteins that mediate these functions and explain the complex phenotypic consequences of its misregulation in vivo...|$|R
40|$|RecBCD is a DNA helicase/exonuclease {{implicated in}} {{degradation}} of foreign linear DNA and in RecA-dependent recombinational repair of chromosomal lesions in E. coli. The low viability of recA recBC mutants vs. recA mutants indicates {{the existence of}} RecA-independent roles for RecBCD. To distinguish among possible RecA-independent roles of the RecBCD enzyme in replication, repair, and DNA degradation, we introduced wild-type and mutant combinations of the recBCD chromosomal region on a low-copy-number plasmid into a DeltarecA DeltarecBCD mutant and determined the viability of resulting strains. Our results argue against ideas that RecBCD is a structural element in the replication factory or is involved in RecA-independent repair of chromosomal lesions. We found that RecBCD-catalyzed DNA degradation is the only activity important for the recA-independent viability, suggesting that degradation of linear tails of sigma-replicating chromosomes {{could be one of}} the RecBCD's roles. However, since the weaker DNA degradation capacity due a combination of the RecBC helicase and ssDNA-specific exonucleases <b>restores</b> <b>viability</b> of the DeltarecA DeltarecBCD mutant to a significant extent, we favor suppression of chromosomal lesions via linear DNA degradation at reversed replication forks as the major RecA-independent role of the RecBCD enzyme...|$|R
40|$|RanBP 2 /Nup 358, {{the major}} {{component}} of the cytoplasmic filaments of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), is essential for mouse embryogenesis and is implicated in both macromolecular transport and mitosis, but its specific molecular functions are unknown. Using RanBP 2 conditional knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts {{and a series of}} mutant constructs, we show that transport, rather than mitotic, functions of RanBP 2 are required for cell viability. Cre-mediated RanBP 2 inactivation caused cell death with defects in M 9 - and classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS) -mediated protein import, nuclear export signal-mediated protein export, and messenger ribonucleic acid export but no apparent mitotic failure. A short N-terminal RanBP 2 fragment harboring the NPC-binding domain, three phenylalanine-glycine motifs, and one Ran-binding domain (RBD) corrected all transport defects and <b>restored</b> <b>viability.</b> Mutation of the RBD within this fragment caused lethality and perturbed binding to Ran guanosine triphosphate (GTP) -importin-beta, accumulation of importin-beta at nuclear pores, and cNLS-mediated protein import. These data suggest that a critical function of RanBP 2 is to capture recycling RanGTP-importin-beta complexes at cytoplasmic fibrils to allow for adequate cNLS-mediated cargo import...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{plasmids}} carrying cro-lacZ gene fusions {{have been}} constructed by joining DNA segments carrying the PR promoter {{and the start of}} the cro gene of bacteriophage lambda to the lacZ gene fragment carried by plasmid pLG 400. Plasmids in which the translational reading frames of the cro and lacZ genes are joined in-register (type I) direct the synthesis of elevated levels of cro-beta-galactosidase fusion protein amounting to 30 % of the total cellular protein, while plasmids in which the genes are fused out-of-register (type II) produce a low level of beta-galactosidase protein. Sequence rearrangements downstream of the cro initiator AUG were found to influence the efficiency of translation, and have been correlated with alterations in the RNA secondary structure of the ribosome-binding site. Plasmids which direct the synthesis of high levels of beta-galactosidase are conditionally lethal and can only be propagated when the PR promoter is repressed. Deletion of sequences downstream of the lacZ gene <b>restored</b> <b>viability,</b> indicating that this region of the plasmid encodes a function which inhibits the growth of the cells. The different applications of these plasmids for expression of cloned genes are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{interactions}} between RNA-binding proteins and snRNP particles modulate eukaryotic pre-mRNA processing patterns to control gene expression. Here, {{we report that}} the conserved U 1 snRNP-interacting RNA-binding protein PSI is essential for Drosophila viability. A null PSI mutation is recessive lethal at the first-instar larval stage, and lethality is fully rescued by transgenes expressing the PSI protein. A mutant transgene that lacks the PSI–U 1 snRNP-interaction domain <b>restores</b> <b>viability</b> but shows courtship behavior abnormalities and meiosis defects during spermatogenesis, resulting in a complete male sterility phenotype. Using cDNA microarrays, we have identified specific target mRNAs with altered expression profiles in these mutant males. A subset of these transcripts is also found associated with PSI in endogenous immunopurified ribonucleoprotein complexes. One specific target, the hrp 40 /squid transcript, shows an altered pre-mRNA splicing pattern in PSI mutant testes. We conclude that a functional association between the PSI protein and the spliceosomal U 1 snRNP particle is required for normal Drosophila development and for the processing of specific PSI-interacting cellular transcripts. These results also validate the use of cDNA microarrays to characterize in vivo RNA-processing defects and alternative pre-mRNA splicing patterns...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we provide a cytological and genetic {{characterization}} of the JIL- 1 locus in Drosophila. JIL- 1 is an essential chromosomal tandem kinase and in JIL- 1 null animals chromatin structure is severely perturbed. Using a range of JIL- 1 hypomorphic mutations, we show that they form an allelic series. JIL- 1 has a strong maternal effect and JIL- 1 activity is required at all stages of development, including embryonic, larval, and pupal stages. Furthermore, we identified a new allele of JIL- 1, JIL- 1 (h 9), that encodes a truncated protein missing COOH-terminal sequences. Remarkably, the truncated JIL- 1 protein can partially <b>restore</b> <b>viability</b> without rescuing the defects in polytene chromosome organization. This suggests that sequences within this region of JIL- 1 {{play an important role}} in establishing and/or maintaining normal chromatin structure. By analyzing the effects of JIL- 1 mutations we provide evidence that JIL- 1 function is necessary for the normal progression of several developmental processes at different developmental stages such as oogenesis and segment specification. We propose that JIL- 1 may exert such effects by a general regulation of chromatin structure affecting gene expression...|$|R
40|$|The TOB or SAM {{complex is}} {{responsible}} for assembling several proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane, including all b-barrel proteins. We have identified several forms of the complex in Neurospora crassa. One form contains Tob 55, Tob 38, and Tob 37; another contains these three subunits plus the Mdm 10 protein; while additional complexes contain only Tob 55. As previously shown for Tob 55, both Tob 37 and Tob 38 are essential for viability of the organism. Mitochondria deficient in Tob 37 or Tob 38 have reduced ability to assemble b-barrel proteins. The function of two hydrophobic domains in the C-terminal region of the Tob 37 protein was investigated. Mutant Tob 37 proteins lacking either or both of these regions are able to <b>restore</b> <b>viability</b> to cells lacking the protein. One of the domains was found to anchor the protein to the outer mitochondrial membrane but was not necessary for targeting or association of the protein with mitochondria. Examination of the import properties of mitochondria containing Tob 37 with deletions of the hydrophobic domains reveals that the topology of Tob 37 may be important for interactions between specific classes of b-barrel precursors and the TOB complex...|$|R
