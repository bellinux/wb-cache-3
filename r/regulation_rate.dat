50|$|Rate-of-Return {{regulation}} {{was mainly}} used {{due to its}} ability to be sustainable in the long-term and resistant {{to changes in the}} company's conditions as well as its popularity among investors. While regulation of this type prevents monopolies with the potential to make large profits from doing so, such as electricity companies, it provides stability. Investors will not make as large dividends off of regulated utility companies; however, {{they will be able to}} make fairly constant, substantial returns despite fluctuations in the economy or firm composure. Investor risk is minimized since the regulator's prudence in price setting is constrained by the method used to set the <b>regulation</b> <b>rate.</b> Therefore, investors can depend on consistency, which can be an attractive offer, especially in a volatile world market.|$|E

40|$|The property-liability {{insurance}} industry has experienced significant turmoil {{during the past}} decade. Three related issues have received enormous attention: increases in the frequency and severity of insurance company insolvencies, high and increasing costs of automobile and workers ’ compensation coverage, and volatility in prices and in availability of commercial liability insurance coverage. These phenomena have led to considerable debate over the efficacy of state insurance regulation and the industry’s limited exemption from antitrust law. Much of the policy debate concerns whether federal regulation of insurance company solvency, expansion of state regulatory control over insurance pricing, and narrowing or elimination of the exemption from antitrust law are needed to deal adequately with these problems. This paper addresses solvency <b>regulation,</b> <b>rate</b> regulation, and the antitrust exemption for the property-liability {{insurance industry}}.

30|$|In [25], {{the authors}} {{proposed}} FuzzyQoS, a stateless cross-layer AC protocol based on fuzzy logic theory for wireless ad hoc networks. The fuzzy approach aims {{to improve the}} control of traffic <b>regulation</b> <b>rate</b> and congestion control of multimedia applications. FuzzyQoS uses fuzzy thresholds to adapt the traffic transmission rate to the dynamic conditions. By monitoring {{the rate of change}} in queue length (variation rate) in addition to the queue length, FuzzyQoS provides a measure of queue state. Furthermore, by using explicit rate congestion notification, FuzzyQoS can make source nodes more responsive to sudden changes in the network traffic volume. The performance evaluation has shown that FuzzyQoS can achieve stable end-to-end delay under different network conditions. However, FuzzyQoS does not deal well with route failures. While searching for a new route, it reduces the data rate of affected sessions. This implies that FuzzyQoS can only support real-time applications with elastic throughput requirements.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{economic}} theories of regulation. It discusses {{the public and}} private interest theories of regulation, as the criticisms that have been leveled at them. The extent to which these theories are also able to account for privatization and deregulation is evaluated and policies involving re-regulation are discussed. The paper thus reviews rate of return regulation, price-cap regulation, yardstick regulation, interconnection and access regulation, and franchising or bidding processes. The primary aim of those instruments is to improve the operating efficiency of the regulated firms. Huge investments will be needed in the regulated network sectors. The question is brought up if regulatory instruments and institutions primarily designed to improve operating efficiency are equally well-placed to promote the necessary investments and to balance the resulting conflicting interests between for example consumers and investors.

40|$|Rate {{of return}} or cost of service {{regulation}} was the traditional {{means by which}} governments, especially in the USA, regulated profitability and prices in privately-owned public utility businesses. However, rate of return regulation was associated with efficiency disincentives. Hence, in 1983 Professor Stephen Littlechild recommended {{the use of a}} price cap to regulate British Telecom when it was privatised. Price caps were later introduced for other privatised utilities in the UK, namely gas, airports, water, electricity and the railways. Similarly, other countries that privatised their utility sectors in the 1980 s and 1990 s often introduced price cap regimes. This paper reports the results of a questionnaire survey of the methods used to regulate profits and prices in privatised utility sectors in a sample of developing and transition economies. In addition to providing an insight into the different methods used in these economies, the questionnaire focuses on the difficulties that their regulators perceive in operating profit and price regulation regimes. developing economies, transition economies, <b>regulation,</b> <b>rate</b> of return, price cap., Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|E

We study the links between competition for deposits and risk taking incentives, and conclude that the welfare performance {{of the market and}} the appropriateness of alternative regulatory measures depend on the degree of rivalry and the deposit insurance regime.

40|$|CFD {{analysis}} of multiple wind towers {{located on the}} same building was performed following validation of a benchmark model against wind tunnel data. The positioning of the wind towers was varied in six different cases, two different arrangements with three different spacing lengths between wind towers. All analysis was compared against the benchmark (isolated) wind tower. The ability of the wind towers, particularly the leeward wind tower, to ventilate the space below was determined for a set occupancy against current guidelines for air supply rates. Furthermore, {{the effect of the}} spacing and arrangement on CO 2 concentration within rooms ventilated by the leeward wind tower was investigated (re-entry of exhaust air pollutants into fresh supply). It was found that a parallel arrangement of wind towers was not effective for ventilating an occupied volume, regardless of the spacing between the two wind towers when incident wind direction was parallel to the arrangement. The maximum supply rate for the leeward wind tower in parallel arrangement at a spacing of 5 m was just over 50 % of the <b>regulation</b> <b>rate</b> (10 L/s/occupant) and 40 % of the supply rate of an isolated wind tower. Decreasing the spacing between the parallel wind towers to 3 m further reduces the supply rate to 2. 4 L/s/occupant and the device was observed to be operating in reverse (airflow entering from leeward opening). As the angle of wind increased, an improvement of air supply rates was seen. For a staggered arrangement of wind towers, the leeward wind tower was capable of supplying the recommended ventilation rates at all tested spacing lengths. The average indoor CO 2 concentration of the space with the leeward wind tower was higher in the parallel arrangement than the staggered arrangement at 0 ° wind angle. For the parallel arrangement, the average CO 2 concentration was 28 – 50 ppm higher than the outdoor air. The staggered arrangement effectively minimised the re-entry of pollutants, with the indoor CO 2 concentration 1 – 3 ppm higher than the outdoor...|$|E
40|$|Many {{problems}} in tracking control {{have been identified}} over the years, such as the availability of systems states, the presence of noise and system uncertainties, and speed of response, {{just to name a}} few. This thesis is concerned with developing novel integrated control and estimation algorithms to overcome some of these {{problems in}} order to achieve an efficient tracking performance. Since there are some significant advantages associated with Sliding Mode Control (SMC) or Variable Structure Control (VSC), (fast <b>regulation</b> <b>rate</b> and robustness to uncertainties), this research reviews and extends new filtering concepts for state estimation, referred to as the Variable Structure Filter (VSF) and Smooth Variable Structure Filter (SVSF). These are based on the philosophy of Sliding Mode Control. The VSF filter is designed to estimate some of the states of a plant when noise and uncertainties are presented. This is accomplished by refining an estimate of the states in an iterative fashion using two filter gains, one based on a noiseless system with no uncertainties and the second gain which reflects these uncertainties. The VSF is combined “seamlessly” with the Sliding Mode Controller to produce an integrated controller called a Sliding Mode Controller and Filter (SMCF). This new controller is shown to be a robust and effective integrated control strategy for linear systems. For nonlinear systems, a novel integrated control strategy called the Smooth Sliding Mode Controller and Filter (SSMCF), fuses the SMC and SVSF in a particular form to address nonlinearities. The gain term in the SVSF is redefined to form a new algorithm called the “SVSF with revised gain” in order to obtain a better estimation performance. Its performance is compared to that of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) when applied to a particular nonlinear plant. The SMCF and SSMCF are applied to the experimental prototype of a precision positioning hydraulic system called an ElectroHydraulic Actuator (EHA) system. The EHA system is known to display nonlinear characteristics but can approximate linear behavior under certain operating conditions, making it ideal to test the robustness of the proposed controllers. The main conclusion drawn in this research was that the SMCF and SSMCF as developed and implemented, do exhibit robust and high performance state estimation and trajectory tracking control given modeling uncertainties and noise. The controllers were applied to a prototype EHA which demonstrated the use of the controllers in a “real world” application. It was also concluded that the application of the concepts of VSC for the controller can alleviate a challenging mechanical problem caused by a slip-stick characteristic in friction. Another conclusion is that the revised form of the SVSF could obtain robust and fast state estimation for nonlinear systems. The original contributions of the research include: i) proposing the SMCF and SSMCF, ii) applying the Sliding Mode Controller to suppress cross-over oscillations caused by the slip-stick characteristics in friction which often occur in mechanical systems, iii) the first application of the SVSF for state estimation and iv) a comparative study of the SVSF and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to the EHA demonstrating the superiority of the SVSF for state estimation performance under both steady-state and transient conditions for the application considered. The dissertation is written in a paper format unlike the traditional Ph. D thesis manuscript. The content of the thesis discourse is based on five manuscripts which are appended {{at the end of the}} thesis. Fundamental principles and concepts associated with SMC, VSF, SVSF and the fused controllers are introduced.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the impact of <b>rate</b> <b>regulation</b> on property-liability insurance prices. Regulation of the property-liability insurance industry occurs at the state level with some states pursuing active <b>rate</b> <b>regulation</b> while others rely on competition to set rates. The co-existence of regulated and competitively determined prices provides an opportunity to examine, both cross-sectionally and over a time series, the impact that <b>rate</b> <b>regulation</b> has on prices. ^ Parallels between put options and insurance contracts are developed. The Black-Scholes put pricing model is then redefined under appropriate conditions and used to derive theoretically fair premiums for portfolios of homogeneous insurance policies. Fair premiums are estimated using three alternative data bases that represent different levels of analysis. ^ Three aspects of the relative differences between fair and actual prices are used to analyze the impact of <b>rate</b> <b>regulation</b> on general price levels in each of the data bases. The method of analysis is multiple group significance tests using a nonparametric ANOVA procedure. First, the relative is compared to analyze the impact of different types of <b>rate</b> <b>regulation.</b> Second, the relative price differences of homeowners, commercial and automobile lines are compared to analyze general price level differences across lines. In addition, relative price level differences of a set of homeowners sublines are compared to analyze relative price level differences across sublines. Third, the relative price differences of each regulatory category, line and subline are compared to analyze price level differences across years. ^ The empirical results show general price levels to be consistent across regulatory categories with line level data, marginally inconsistent with homeowners subline data and inconsistent across line, sublines and years. The results suggest that <b>rate</b> <b>regulation</b> impacts relative price levels only marginally at best. Since orderly insurance markets exist in the absence of <b>rate</b> <b>regulation,</b> the continued existence of <b>rate</b> <b>regulation</b> efforts at the state level should be seriously questioned by consumers, regulators and the insurance industry. ...|$|R
