50|$|The {{produced}} radionuclides have varying half-lives, {{and therefore}} vary in radioactivity. For instance, strontium-89 and strontium-90 are produced in similar quantities in fission, and each nucleus decays by beta emission. But 90Sr has a 30-year half-life, and 89Sr a 50.5-day half-life. Thus in the 50.5 days it takes half the 89Sr atoms to decay, emitting {{the same number}} of beta particles as there were decays, less than 0.4% of the 90Sr atoms have decayed, emitting only 0.4% of the betas. The <b>radioactive</b> <b>emission</b> rate is highest for the shortest lived radionuclides, although they also decay the fastest. Additionally, less stable fission products are less likely to decay to stable nuclides, instead decaying to other radionuclides, which undergo further decay and radiation emission, adding to the radiation output. It is these short lived fission products that are the immediate hazard of spent fuel, and the energy output of the radiation also generates significant heat which must be considered when storing spent fuel. As there are hundreds of different radionuclides created, the initial radioactivity level fades quickly as short lived radionuclides decay, but never ceases completely as longer lived radionuclides make up {{more and more of the}} remaining unstable atoms.|$|E

30|$|The {{interpretation}} of lithology of targeted zones derived from integration of log responses and cross-plots. GR index {{is primarily a}} function of shale content because the GR tool is sensitive to detect <b>radioactive</b> <b>emission</b> dominantly concentrated in clay mineral of shale and clean sand (feldspar rich). However, GR log readings increase as the proportion of shale increases in the formations.

The sandstone packages acting as reservoir within understudy area has been identified through low values of GR, neutroN–Density (ND) cross plot in which the accumulation of clusters {{at the base of}} standard sandstone axis (green color, Fig.  4 b), similarly M–N cross-plots show the clusters falling dominantly in Quartz region.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{order to}} shed light on the {{regenerative}} mechanism of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vivo, the bio-distribution profile of implanted cells using a stable and long-term tracking method is needed. We herein investigated the bio-distribution of human placental deciduas basalis derived MSCs (termed as PDB-MSCs) in nude mice after intravenous injection by carbon radioisotope labeling thymidine ((14) C-TdR), which is able to incorporate into new DNA strands during cell replication. RESULTS: The proliferation rate and <b>radioactive</b> <b>emission</b> of human PDB-MSCs after labeled with different concentrations of (14) C-TdR were measured. PDB-MSCs labeled with 1 μCi possessed high radioactivity, and the biological characteristics (i. e. morphology, colony forming ability, differentiation capabilities, karyotype and cell cycle) showed no significant changes after labeling. Thus, 1 μCi was the optimal concentration in this experimental design. In nude mice, 1 [*]×[*] 10 (6) (14) C-TdR-labeled PDB-MSCs were injected intravenously and the organs were collected at days 1, 2, 3, 5, 30 and 180 after injection, respectively. Radiolabeled PDB-MSCs were found mainly in the lung, liver, spleen, stomach and left femur of the recipient nude mice at the whole observation period. CONCLUSIONS: This work provided solid evidence that (14) C-TdR labeling did not alter the biological characteristics of human placental MSCs, and that this labeling method has potential to decrease the signal from non-infused or dead cells for cell tracking. Therefore, this labeling technique can be utilized to quantify the infused cells after long-term follow-up in pre-clinical studie...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Forests {{represent}} {{very efficient}} filters of atmospheric aerosols. Radionuclides that are fixed on those aerosols {{fall on the}} aerial part of trees and understorey (leaves, branches and trunks) and on the soil (litter, mosses and first soil layers). Due to the high content of organic matters in the forest soils {{and the existence of}} a nutrition cycle by the hurnification process, radionuclides show a higher biodisponibility than in agricultural soils. IPSN developed, in collaboration with a finnish team from STUK (Finnish Nuclear Safety Authority), a model to assess the consequences of an atmospheric <b>radioactive</b> <b>emission</b> in a foresl ecosystem. This dynamic compartment model has been developed with a simple and operational objective of crisis management. This model needs data relative to dry and wet depositions that are distributed in the ecosystem to trees, understorey and soil. Calculation of transfers between the different compartments of the ecosystem are used to calculate concentrations in forest products and external exposure. Then, ingestion dose and external exposure are calculated for several population groups: six age groups for the population, forest workers, hunters and mushroom and berry pickers. Calculations are made for iodine, caesium, strontium and plutonium isotopes and for three generic forest types: coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests. Forest structures vary in Europe with climate and soil type and also due to forest management. Many parameters in the model database are regional and should be adapted in order to substantially improve the estimations. 1...|$|E
