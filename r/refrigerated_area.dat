50|$|A shoe-maker {{shop and}} a pump house were built. Self-sufficient dormitories, classrooms, several lavatories, kitchen, a scullery, pantry, <b>refrigerated</b> <b>area,</b> corridors, offices, cloistered area, laundry room, infirmary, bakery and tailor shop were {{housed in the}} school. In 1981 a chapel was added. Near the school stood a wind mill {{powerhouse}} and shoe shop, a mill and a storage for milled products, a huge barn which held cows, several horse teams, a bull, a dairy operation and a blacksmith shop, a piggery and sheepery, a chicken coop and a garden. At the wharf was a 30 ft cruiser named the Garnier and a vessel called Red Bug were tied up.|$|E
5000|$|There are, however, several {{indications}} disputing this theory. The Buckskin Girl {{was missing}} shoes {{when she was}} found, {{but there was no}} indication that she had participated in any sexual activity prior to death. Furthermore, she was fairly well-groomed, unlike many of the other victims. Some, like the Hebron Jane Doe had participated in sexual activity before their deaths, a factor which indicated that they were sex workers. Also diverging from the theory, Patterson's body had been wrapped in a sleeping bag and was likely stored in a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>area</b> for [...] "nearly a month" [...] before it was located {{on the side of a}} highway.|$|E

50|$|The Busan Cooperative Fish Market, or BCFM, is {{the largest}} fish market in South Korea. It adjoins the South Harbor in Busan. More than 30% of the country's fish {{production}} passes through the market. In recent years, {{a large percentage of}} the catch has been made up of yellowtail, due to warming waters in the Sea of Japan (East Sea). The market occupies an area of 166,420 m2, of which about 10% is a <b>refrigerated</b> working <b>area.</b>|$|R

50|$|Brittany {{began her}} new career on 20 June 1962 {{with a series}} of nine week-long {{roundtrip}} cruises between New York and the West Indies, accepting only 500 passengers in the best cabins. These voyages were catered and operated by Chandris in close conjunction with Caribbean Cruise Lines — publicity was favorable in contrast with the previous year. Capacity averaged 95% and plans were made {{to increase the number of}} cabins by 110 through the conversion of two <b>refrigerated</b> cargo <b>areas,</b> a process that was undertaken in transit by workmen brought aboard during the New York - Caribbean cruises. The changes would create a single passenger class of 1,500 berths, including the 150 former first class ones, for an extended summer cruise season in 1963.|$|R
50|$|The Minnesota State Fair {{has never}} had a Buttercow, but showcases butter {{sculpture}} in another way. The fair commissions carvings in butter of the twelve finalists of the Princess Kay of the Milky Way contest. These finalists are chosen from young Minnesotan {{women between the ages of}} 16 and 23 to be Dairy Princesses. Their likenesses are carved from 90 lb. blocks of butter. Each of the twelve days of the fair one finalist will be carved, currently by Linda Christensen, a California sculptor originally from Minnesota. While a princess poses on a turning platform in a chilled display case, Christensen takes about six hours to carve her likeness, all in front of fairgoers, passing by the <b>refrigerated</b> display <b>area.</b> Once the carving is complete it is displayed for the remainder of the fair, and at its closing each dairy princess may take hers home and use it as she wishes (sometimes used at graduation parties or wedding receptions).|$|R
2500|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} <b>refrigerated</b> storage <b>area</b> in {{the basement}} opened for use in July 1893. The basement storage area consists of 52 separate rooms ranging in volume from [...] {{for a total of}} [...] of storage space. The temperature of each room can be controlled individually to meet temperature requirements for different goods: [...] for meat and poultry, [...] for fruits and vegetables. The refrigeration system uses brine water and ammonia, and includes an array of specially designed pumps, compressors, and other equipment in its operation. The storage area was more expensive to maintain and had a larger staff than the market itself, though refrigerating the basement storage area was thought to be well worth the high cost. It allowed merchants to keep seasonal products in stock all year round for the first time. Third parties also leased the storage area for storing other goods. Restaurants and plant and produce sellers around the area leased out space {{in the basement}}. Hospitals used the basement area to store perishable medicine. Local Breweries, including Yuengling, used it to store their hops.|$|R

25|$|Reading Terminal Market (pronounced RED-ing /ˈrɛdɪŋ/) is an {{enclosed}} public market located at 12th and Arch Streets in Center City Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It opened originally in 1893 under the elevated train shed of the Reading Railroad Company {{after the city}} of Philadelphia advocated to move public markets from the streets into indoor facilities for both safety and sanitary reasons.The Reading Railroad Company owned and operated the market space until 1976 when the company liquidated, leaving the market without its parent company and foot traffic from the train. Presently, it still occupies the ground floor and basement levels of the Reading Terminal's former train shed which {{is now part of}} the Philadelphia Convention Center. Vendor stalls occupy the ground floor with entrances on Filbert Street to the South, Twelfth Street to the West, and Arch Street to the North. The stalls are arranged in a grid pattern with an open area in the center with tables and seating. Over one hundred merchants offer fresh produce, meats, fish, artisan cheese, groceries, ice cream, flowers, grilled cheese, baked goods, crafts, books, clothing, and specialty and ethnic foods. Two of the vendors are descendants of original merchants from the initial opening in the late 1800s. The basement floor of the market holds the state-of-the-art <b>refrigerated</b> storage <b>area</b> for vendor use. Currently, the market is open {{every day of the week}} although the Pennsylvania Dutch merchants (a small but significant minority) generally do not operate Sunday through Tuesday.|$|R
40|$|A methodological {{framework}} with models is provided, which correlates behavioral and perceptual {{issues related to}} the use of intermodal transportation with the commonly used physical and economic criteria in modal choice approaches. With factor analysis, key variables and common decision patterns related to the choice of intermodal transportation are identified. Factor analysis is applied to capture the actors' perception of the importance of variables affecting the decision-making process. With multiple regression analysis, models simulating the decision-making process are developed for actor groups, utilizing actual quantitative data of cost and performance of intermodal transportation services. Three decision patterns and the respective actor groups' profiles are identified. The first group consists of actors who decide almost exclusively according to the cost criterion; these actors are intensive users of intermodal transportation. The second group has actors who decide according to both quality and cost criteria; using intermodal transportation by this actor group constitutes a minor portion of its total transport volumes. The third group consists of actors who are influenced in their decisions by specific logistics needs, beyond the physical transportation activity itself. The offer of third-party end-haul operations or <b>refrigerated</b> storage <b>areas</b> is an example of such services, necessitating specific logistic support. For each actor group a model is developed, which associates values of the quantitative variables affecting the decision-making process with the share of intermodal transportation in the total volume of transport handled by the group. The application of the model defines the extent to which changes in the values of relevant variables may shift a decision toward the use of intermodal transportation...|$|R
40|$|Chinese roasted pork {{has been}} implicated {{as a major}} source of food {{poisoning}} caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Establishing the source, either as contaminants from raw meat or from food handlers, could facilitate drafting more appropriate guidelines for better prevention of food poisoning. To determine the rate and source of staphylococcal contamination, roasted pork purchased from 50 sui-mei shops in Hong Kong was sampled for presence of S. aureus by enrichment and subsequent culture. Isolates were characterized for methicillin sensitivity, spa type, and presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs). Methicillin-resistant isolates were confirmed by presence of mecA and SCCmec type and sensitivity to vancomycin investigated. S. aureus was isolated from 25 (50 %) samples, with 3 yielding two colony types. Of the 28 isolates, 3 were resistant to cefoxitin, but only 2 were mecA positive and belonged to SCCmec type V. The mecA negative isolate also lacked mecC, but had a penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration of 10 mg/L. A livestock-associated spa type (t 034) was only observed in one methicillin-sensitive strain, all other isolates appearing to be of human origin, with 30 % belonging to t 189. One isolate was PVL positive and five carried genes for classical SEs. The high rate of staphylococcal contamination observed was probably associated with food handlers, as the strains belonged to spa types previously reported in clinical and nasal carriage isolates. The presence of enterotoxins in 18 % of isolates confirms the risk of food poisoning associated with this product and emphasizes the need for improved guidelines for handling after preparation.
