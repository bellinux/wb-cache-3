40|$|Objectives To {{examine how}} {{perceptions}} of parental responsibility for diabetes management {{are associated with}} age, pubertal status, adolescents’ self-efficacy, and parental perceptions of adolescents’ efficacy, and if parental <b>responsibility</b> <b>is</b> associated with better metabolic control {{as a function of}} adolescents’ self-efficacy and parental perceptions of adolescents’ efficacy.  Methods Questionnaires assessing parental responsibility, pubertal status, adolescents’ self-efficacy, and parental perceptions of adolescents’ efficacy were given to 185 adolescents with type 1 diabetes, 185 mothers, and 145 fathers.  Results Greater parental <b>responsibility</b> <b>was</b> negatively associated with age, perceptions of pubertal status, and efficacy for all reporters. Interactions between parental responsibility and parental perceptions of adolescents’ efficacy indicated that parental <b>responsibility</b> <b>was</b> associated with better metabolic control when adolescents were perceived to have lower efficacy.  Conclusions Adolescents’ and parents’ perceptions of parental <b>responsibility</b> <b>are</b> related to multiple factors. Metabolic control is best when high parental <b>responsibility</b> <b>is</b> maintained among adolescents with lower efficacy...|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{the four}} part CSR {{definition}} forms {{a conceptual framework}} that includes the economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic or discretionary expectations that society places on businesses at a given point in time. And, in terms of understanding each type of <b>responsibility,</b> it could <b>be</b> said that the economic <b>responsibility</b> <b>is</b> “required” of business by society; the legal <b>responsibility</b> also <b>is</b> “required” of business by society; the ethical <b>responsibility</b> <b>is</b> “expected” of business by society; and the philanthropic <b>responsibility</b> <b>is</b> “expected/desired” of business by society (Carroll 1979, 1991). Also, as time passes what exactly each of these four categories means may change or evolve as well.|$|R
5|$|Singapore's Elected Presidency {{scheme was}} {{created as a}} {{constitutional}} safeguard for the nation's future to prevent irresponsible governance.

However, the President's role is custodial and ceremonial – he does not exercise executive powers.

5|$|The CPC is, officially, {{organized}} on {{the basis}} of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the National Congress, convened every fifth year. When the National Congress is not in session, the Central Committee is the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year, most duties and <b>responsibilities</b> <b>are</b> vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. The party's leader holds the offices of General Secretary (responsible for civilian party duties), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) (responsible for military affairs) and State President (a largely ceremonial position). Through these posts the party leader is the country's paramount leader. The current paramount leader is Xi Jinping who was elected at the 19th National Congress held in October 2017.|$|E

5|$|The law {{governing}} aviation in the UK {{is defined}} by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which is updated periodically with amendments, the latest being the Civil Aviation Act 2006. The government department responsible for legislating changes in national policy and long term strategy relating to aviation is the Department for Transport (DfT). At the operational level the independently run Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulates economic, safety, and consumer protection aspects, as well as airspace policy, although these <b>responsibilities</b> <b>are</b> being increasingly ceded to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). International aspects of air transport are regulated by agreements made within the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as established by the Chicago Convention, whilst most new legislation is now made at the European level through the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). As a consequence, other than in airport development, there are few aspects of the air transport industry in which the government can act in isolation.|$|E
