25|$|Because of the {{particular}} characteristics of flash memory, it is best used with either a controller to perform wear leveling and error correction or specifically designed flash file systems, which spread writes over the media {{and deal with the}} long erase times of NORflash blocks. The basic concept behind flash file systems is the following: when the flash store is to be updated, the file system will write a new copy of the changed data to a fresh block, <b>remap</b> the file pointers, then erase the old block later when it has time.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} damage {{to just one}} side of the MTL, there is {{opportunity}} for normal functioning or near-normal function for memories. Neuroplasticity describes the ability of the cortex to <b>remap</b> when necessary. Remapping can occur in cases like the one above, and, with time, the patient can recover and become more skilled at remembering. A case report describing a patient who had two lobectomies– in the first, doctors removed part of her right MTL first because of seizures originating from the region, and later her left because she developed a tumor– demonstrates this. This case is unique because it is the only one in which both sides of the MTL were removed at different times. The authors observed that the patient was able to recover some ability to learn when she had only one MTL, but observed the deterioration of function when both sides of the MTL were afflicted. The reorganization of brain function for epileptic patients has not been investigated much, but imaging results show that it is likely.|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} studies, we {{demonstrated that}} the forebrain commissures are the primary pathway for <b>remapping</b> from one hemifield to the other. Nonetheless, <b>remapping</b> in lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) across hemifield is still present in split brain monkeys. This finding indicates that a subcortical structure must contribute to <b>remapping.</b> The primary goal {{of the current study}} was to characterize <b>remapping</b> activity in the superior colliculus in intact and split brain monkeys. We recorded neurons in both the superficial and intermediate layers of the SC. We found that across-hemifield <b>remapping</b> was reduced in magnitude and delayed compared with within-hemifield <b>remapping</b> in the intermediate layers of the SC in split brain monkeys. These results mirror our previous findings in area LIP. In contrast, we found no difference in the magnitude or latency for within- compared with across-hemifield <b>remapping</b> in the superficial layers. At the behavioral level, we compared the performance of the monkeys on two conditions of a double-step task. When the second target remained within a single hemifield, performance remained accurate. When the second target had to be updated across hemifields, the split brain monkeys' performance was impaired. <b>Remapping</b> activity in the intermediate layers was correlated with the accuracy and latency of the second saccade during the across-hemifield trials. <b>Remapping</b> in the superficial layers was correlated with latency of the second saccade during the within- and across-hemifield trials. The differences between the layers suggest that different circuits underlie <b>remapping</b> in the superficial and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus...|$|R
25|$|Phantom limbs are a {{phenomenon}} which occurs following amputation of a limb from an individual. In 90–98% of cases, amputees report feeling {{all or part}} of the limb or body part still there, taking up space. The amputee may perceive a limb under full control, or paralyzed. A common side effect of phantom limbs is phantom limb pain. The neurophysiological mechanisms by which phantom limbs occur is still under debate. A common theory posits that the afferent neurons, since deafferented due to amputation, typically <b>remap</b> to adjacent cortical regions within the brain. This can cause amputees to report feeling their missing limb being touched when a seemingly unrelated part of the body is stimulated (such as if the face is touched, but the amputee also feels their missing arm being stroked in a specific location). Another facet of phantom limbs is that the efferent copy (motor feedback) responsible for reporting on position to the body schema does not attenuate quickly. Thus the missing body part may be attributed by the amputee to still be in a fixed or movable position.|$|E
25|$|Although place cells {{primarily}} rely on visuospatial input, {{some studies}} suggest that olfactory input may {{also play a role}} in generating and recalling place fields. Relatively {{little is known about the}} interaction between place cells and non-visual sensory cues, but preliminary studies have shown that non-visual sensory input may have supplementary role in place field formation. A study by Save et al. found that olfactory information can be used to compensate for a loss of visual information. In this study, place fields in subjects exposed to an environment with no light and no olfactory signals were unstable; the position of the place field shifted abruptly and some of the constituent place cells stopped firing entirely. However, place cells in subjects exposed to a dark environment with olfactory signals remained stable despite a lack of visual cues. An additional study by Zhang et al. examined how the hippocampus uses olfactory signals to create and recall place fields. Similar to the Save et al. study, this study exposed subjects to an environment with a series of odors but no visual or auditory information. Place fields remained stable and even adapted to the rotation of the pattern of olfactory signals. Furthermore, the place fields would <b>remap</b> entirely when the odors were moved randomly. This suggests that place cells not only utilize olfactory information to generate place fields, but also use olfactory information to orient place fields during movement.|$|E

40|$|Saccadic eye {{movements}} rapidly {{displace the}} image of the world that is projected onto the retinas. In anticipation of each saccade, many neurons in the visual system shift their receptive fields. This presaccadic change in visual sensitivity, known as <b>remapping,</b> was first documented in the parietal cortex and has been studied in many other brain regions. <b>Remapping</b> requires information about upcoming saccades via corollary discharge. Analyses of neurons in a corollary discharge pathway that targets the frontal eye field (FEF) suggest that <b>remapping</b> may be assembled in the FEF's local microcircuitry. Complementary data from reversible inactivation, neural recording, and modeling studies provide evidence that <b>remapping</b> contributes to transsaccadic continuity of action and perception.

40|$|Right parietal lesions {{often lead}} to neglect, in which {{patients}} fail to attend to leftward stimuli. Recent models of neglect suggest that, in addition to attentional impairments, patients demonstrate impairments of spatial <b>remapping</b> and/or spatial working memory (SWM). Although spatial <b>remapping</b> {{could be considered a}} kind of spatial memory process itself (i. e., updating remembered locations based on anticipated saccade outcomes), the two processes operate on very different time scales (milliseconds versus seconds). In the present study, the influence of saccadic and spatial <b>remapping</b> on SWM was examined in healthy individuals. An initial control condition, in which participants had to respond to a probe stimulus (i. e., “is the probe in the location previously occupied by the target?”) following a 1500 ms delay, was contrasted with conditions in which the fixation point moved (left, right, up, or down) {{at the onset of the}} delay. In a second version of the task, participants made covert shifts of attention at delay onset requiring covert spatial, rather than saccadic, <b>remapping.</b> In both tasks SWM performance was best when no <b>remapping</b> was required. Decrements in SWM were largest overall in the spatial <b>remapping</b> task, whereas for both saccadic and spatial <b>remapping,</b> a consistent cost was observed for <b>remapping</b> the target array into right visual space.

40|$|Neurons in {{the lateral}} intraparietal area, frontal eye field, and {{superior}} colliculus exhibit {{a pattern of}} activity known as <b>remapping.</b> When a salient visual stimulus is presented shortly before a saccade, the representation of that stimulus is updated, or <b>remapped,</b> {{at the time of}} the eye movement. This updating is presumably based on a corollary discharge of the eye movement command. To investigate whether visual areas also exhibit <b>remapping,</b> we recorded from single neurons in extrastriate and striate cortex while monkeys performed a saccade task. Around the time of the saccade, a visual stimulus was flashed either at the location occupied by the neuron's receptive field (RF) before the saccade (old RF) or at the location occupied by it after the saccade (new RF). More than half (52 %) of V 3 A neurons responded to a stimulus flashed in the new RF even though the stimulus had already disappeared before the saccade. These neurons responded to a trace of the flashed stimulus brought into the RF by the saccade. In 16 % of V 3 A neurons, <b>remapped</b> activity began even before saccade onset. <b>Remapping</b> also was observed at earlier stages of the visual hierarchy, including in areas V 3 and V 2. At these earlier stages, the proportion of neurons that exhibited <b>remapping</b> decreased, and the latency of <b>remapped</b> activity increased relative to saccade onset. <b>Remapping</b> was very rare in striate cortex.

40|$|The {{input to}} our visual system shifts {{every time we}} move our eyes. To {{maintain}} a stable percept of the world, visual representations must be updated with each saccade. Near the time of a saccade, neurons in several visual areas become sensitive to the regions of visual space that their receptive fields occupy after the saccade. This process, known as <b>remapping,</b> transfers information from one set of neurons to another, and may provide a mechanism for visual stability. However, {{it is not clear}} whether <b>remapping</b> transfers information about stimulus features in addition to information about stimulus location. To investigate this issue, we recorded blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses while human subjects viewed images of faces and houses (two visual categories with many feature differences). Immediately after some image presentations, subjects made a saccade that moved the previously stimulated location to the opposite side of the visual field. We then used a combination of univariate analyses and multivariate pattern analyses to test whether information about stimulus location and stimulus features were <b>remapped</b> to the ipsilateral hemisphere after the saccades. We found no reliable indication of stimulus feature <b>remapping</b> in any region. However, we also found no reliable indication of stimulus location <b>remapping,</b> despite the fact that our paradigm was highly similar to previous fMRI studies of <b>remapping.</b> The absence of location <b>remapping</b> in our study precludes strong conclusions regarding feature <b>remapping.</b> However, these results also suggest that measurement of location <b>remapping</b> with fMRI depends strongly on the details of the experimental paradigm used.

40|$|In {{this article}} we present a 2 D {{conservative}} <b>remapping</b> method which relies on exact polygonal mesh in-tersection, high accurate polynomial reconstruction (up to degree 5) and a posteriori stabilization based onMOOD paradigm [21, 30, 31, 80]. This paradigm does not compute any sort of a priori limiter for the poly-nomial reconstructions. Instead it rather observes if the candidate solution after <b>remapping</b> does not fulfilluser-given validity criteria, and, in this case, locally to those so-called problematic cells, the method decre-ments the polynomial degree for the reconstructions. These problematic cells are then recomputed startingfrom lower order accurate polynomial representations on the old mesh. Next, the candidate <b>remapped</b> so-lution in these cells is again tested against the validity criteria and, possibly, some degree decrementationis applied once again. Such iterative procedure always ends either with a valid <b>remapped</b> solution obtainedfrom polynomial degree greater than 0, or, in the worst case scenario, with a formally first order accurateremapped cell <b>remapped</b> (without any polynomial reconstruction).

40|$|We {{perceive}} a stable visual world even though saccades often move our retinas. One way the brain may achieve a stable visual percept is through predictive <b>remapping</b> of visual receptive fields: {{just before a}} saccade, the receptive field of many neurons moves from its current location ("current receptive field") to the location {{it is expected to}} occupy after the saccade ("future receptive field"). Goldberg and colleagues found such <b>remapping</b> in cortical areas, e. g. in the frontal eye field (FEF), {{as well as in the}} intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (SC). In the present study we investigated the source of the SC's <b>remapped</b> visual signals. Do some of them come from the FEF? We identified FEF neurons that project to the SC using antidromic stimulation. For neurons with a visual response, we tested whether the receptive field shifted just prior to making a saccade. Saccadic amplitudes were chosen to be as small as possible while clearly separating the current and future receptive fields; they ranged from 5 - 30 deg. in amplitude and were directed contraversively. The saccadic target was a small red spot. We probed visual responsiveness at the current and future receptive field locations using a white spot flashed at various times before or after the saccade. Predictive <b>remapping</b> was indicated by a visual response to a probe flashed in the future receptive field just before the saccade began. We found that many FEF neurons projecting to the SC exhibited predictive <b>remapping.</b> Moreover, the <b>remapping</b> was as fast and strong as any previously reported for FEF or SC. It is clear, therefore, that <b>remapped</b> visual signals are sent from FEF to SC, providing direct evidence that the FEF is one source of the SC's <b>remapped</b> visual signals. Because <b>remapping</b> requires information about an imminent saccade, we hypothesize that <b>remapping</b> in FEF depends on corollary discharge signals such as those ascending from the SC through MD thalamus (Sommer and Wurtz 2002) ...|$|R
