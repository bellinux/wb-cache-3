While {{there are at least two}} general barriers to utilizing CDM finance for RE deployment - namely high project costs and the proof of additionality - this article argues that an appropriate national regulation can lead RE technologies to a stage of commercialisation at which CDM financing can become crucial. For an assessment of the current policy mix in place in China for the deployment of <b>renewable</b> <b>energies,</b> the article compares the national Chinese regulations for <b>renewable</b> <b>energies</b> and China's specific CDM rules for their impact: where do general and CDM-specific regulations for the promotion of <b>renewable</b> <b>energies</b> provide synergies, where does the policy-making on these two levels collide?Clean development mechanism <b>Renewable</b> <b>energies</b> China Project financing Project additionality Project risk assessment...|$|R

5|$|The {{incentive}} to use 100% <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> for electricity, transport, or even {{total primary energy}} supply globally, has been motivated by global warming and other ecological {{as well as economic}} concerns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. In reviewing 164 recent scenarios of future <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050. <b>Renewable</b> <b>energy</b> use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated.

Additionally, in November 2010, the government approved a US$300billion program to make factories and buildings more energy efficient; it also announced plans to construct eight energy-efficient lamp production plants, promote recycling and support the construction of a hybrid car plant. Medvedev {{announced in}} late 2009 that he wanted to cut Russian energy consumption by 40% by 2020. At the moment, development is slowed by low investment, economic instability, low public demand and low tariffs on heat and electricity.
