5|$|Aircraft {{suitability}} {{once again}} {{came in for}} discussion during the war. Ansons and Boulton Paul Defiants were not suitable for ASR operations. The Vickers Warwick was earmarked for the main ASR aircraft. Four 20-aircraft squadrons with specialised ASR conversion were to be made available by the spring, 1943. While development was slow. Nevertheless, the effort paid off. In May 1943, 156 men of Bomber Command were <b>rescued</b> from the sea by No. 279 Squadron alone. By the end of 1943 Coastal Command had <b>rescued</b> 1,684 aircrew out of 5,466 presumed to have ditched in the sea. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, 163 aircrew and 60 other personnel were <b>rescued.</b> During the month, June 1944, 355 were saved by ASR units of Coastal Command. In all, 10,663 persons were <b>rescued</b> by Coastal Command in ASR operations. Of this total, 5,721 were Allied aircrew, 277 enemy aircrew, and 4,665 non-aircrew.|$|E
