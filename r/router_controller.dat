Examples of such signaling messages are RSVP messages. In addition with increasing interest in active networking, {{there is a need to}} construct mechanisms that enable dynamic introduction of flow specific control policies, and message exchanges between these user supplied policies without incurring excessive processing overhead. This memo describes a new hop-by-hop extension header for IPv 6 and a router alert option for IPv 4 that is to be used to carry control information to <b>router</b> <b>controllers.</b> The extension is a mechanism to broadcast a control message to all controllers of a particular flow, and differs from exsisting router alerts only in that it is to be forwarded before it is processed. 1.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{adaptive control}} techniques {{for the prevention}} of end-to-end traffic congestion in the Internet. Instead of using heuristics to solve the congestion problem, we have systematically applied the classical control theory in our controller design in order to always guarantee the stability of the Internet control systems, and instead of using time-domain approaches, we have employed the frequency domain techniques in our control design. To support AQM(Active Queue Management) in the router, we have designed the adaptive P (Proportional) and the adaptive PI (Proportional-Integral) window-based <b>router</b> <b>controllers</b> for the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) traffic. Our adaptive controllers self-tune only when significant changes in network parameters have caused the phase margin or the gain margin of the AQM control system to drift outside a specified interval. Using the same control theoretical framework, we have provided different controllers to support best-effort streaming media traffic under different network models that we want to study. We first design an adaptive PI rate-based controller in typical network with SISO (Single-Input Single-Output) IP (Internet Protocol) routers. We then employ the DNA (Direct Nyquist Array) method to design an adaptive multi-loop PI rate-based controller under a network with MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) IP routers. In addition to window-based and rate-based router control algorithms, we finally design an adaptive utility-based source controller based on pole-placement technique that can provide a relatively smooth source transmission rate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Active queue {{management}} (AQM) algorithms {{have been}} proposed to leverage TCP protocol inherent congestion algorithms which usually fail to maintain the queue length to an average level under large or bursting workloads. The main task of AQM algorithms is to detect network congestion at its early stages and start drop packets before the congestion affects the network throughput in a high degree. In this paper, an new <b>router</b> <b>controller</b> is proposed based on optimal control theory and is compared to the most important AQM algorithms according to their functionality, characteristics and their parameters. Furthermore, illustrative simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate overall system performance queue length response over different number of flows at different time intervals. The proposed algorithm results significant improvement of performance of the network and faster respond to external loads. Key-Words:- AQM, router models, network congestion, optimal control. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} theoretical design, network simulation, implementation, {{and experimental}} studies of optical packet routing systems supporting variable-length packets. The optical packet switching network exploits unified contention resolution in core routers in three optical domains (wavelength, time, and space) and in edge routers by traffic shaping. The optical <b>router</b> <b>controller</b> and lookup table, implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), effectively incorporates the contention resolution scheme with pipelined arbitration of asynchronously arriving variable-length packets. In addition, real-time performance monitoring based on the strong correlation between the bit-error rates of the optical label {{and those of the}} data payload indicates its application in optical time-to-live detection for loop mitigations. Successful systems integration resulted in experimental demonstration of the all-optical packet switching system with contention resolution for variable-size packets.

40|$|Abstract—Named Data Network (NDN) routing schemes {{must learn}} routes to named data locations, so routers {{know where to}} send {{interest}} packets. These routing schemes are based on IP routing schemes, therefore they inherit characteristics such as prefix dissemination and routing based prefix longest match. As the amount of named data and non-aggregated prefixes increase, routers store more routes and exchange more control messages, which results in high control overhead and possible Forwarding Information Base explosion. We address these issues with a novel Controller-based Routing Scheme (CRoS) for NDN. CRoS introduces special controllers which have two main functions: i) acquire topology and calculate routes, and ii) store named data locations. Named data locations are registered in controllers. On interest packets to an unknown prefix, <b>routers</b> request <b>controllers</b> for installation of a new route. CRoS controllers implement distributed hash tables to distribute the storage of named data locations efficiently. Furthermore, as CRoS runs {{on top of the}} NDN, it preserves NDN features such congestion control, network problem detection and path diversity. I...|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{other works}} apply ML {{techniques}} to build novel congestion control mechanisms for non-TCP-based networks. ACCPndn [230] propose {{to include a}} TLFN into a controller node for predicting the rate of entries arriving to the Pending Interest Table (PIT) of NDN <b>routers.</b> The <b>controller</b> node gathers historical PIT entries rate from contributing routers and sends the prediction back to the corresponding router. The defined TLFN consists of two hidden layers between the input and output layers. The number of neurons for each layer corresponds {{to the number of}} contributing routers. To improve the parameter tuning of the TLFN trained using BP, the authors introduce a hybrid training algorithm that combines two optimization methods: PSO and GA. Various tests on synthetic data collected from ns- 2 simulations demonstrate that the TLFN trained with PSO-GA provides a lower prediction error than the TLFN with other training algorithms, such as GA-PSO, GA or PSO only, and BP. Additionally, ACCPndn incorporate fuzzy decision-making in each router that uses the predicted PIT entries rate to proactively respond to network congestion. This congestion control mechanism considerably outperforms other NDN congestion control protocols, such as NACK [487] and HoBHIS [392], in terms of packet drop and link utilization.|$|R

The reason of congestion {{is a lack}} of bandwidth and continuously customer requirements growth in transmission rate to network content. In this article is investigated influence of data transmission link parameters, as an available bandwidth and packet transmission delay, to queue discipline processing in access <b>router.</b> Fuzzy logic <b>controller</b> (FLC) is considered as an active queue management discipline processing with explicit congestion notification (ECN). Traffic congestion is simulated in a bottleneck link between two routers in Network simulator- 2 (NS- 2) software. Queue discipline processing was estimated by calculation the quality of service indicators: packets loss, average packet delay and packet delay variation. Statistical analysis of simulation result have given the possibility to define dependence between the quality of service indicators and the data link parameters applicable to considered queue discipline.

40|$|There {{has been}} little work {{investigating}} the overall perfor-mance impact of on-chip communication in manycore com-pute accelerators. In this paper we evaluate performance of a GPU-like compute accelerator running CUDA work-loads and consisting of compute nodes, interconnection net-work and the graphics DRAM memory system using de-tailed cycle-level simulation. First, we study performance of a baseline architecture employing a scalable mesh network. We then propose several microarchitectural techniques to exploit the communication characteristics of these applica-tions while providing a cost-effective (i. e., low area) on-chip network. Instead of increasing costly bisection bandwidth, we increase the the number of injection ports at the mem-ory <b>controller</b> <b>router</b> nodes to increase terminal bandwidth at the few nodes. In addition, we propose a novel “checker-board ” on-chip network which alternates between conven-tional, full-routers and half-routers with limited connectiv-ity. This network is enabled by limited communication of the many-to-few traffic pattern. We describe a minimal routing algorithm for the checkerboard network that does not in-crease the hop count...|$|R
40|$|Virtual Networks {{are more}} {{commonly}} used {{for the purpose of}} research, engineering, etc. The rise in the concept of virtual networks gave birth to SDNs. These are programmable networks which can be configured each time based on the needs of the user. SDNs are made up of virtual <b>routers,</b> switches, <b>controllers</b> and virtual hosts. The main aim of this research is to increase the throughput of virtual networks by implementing a dynamic routing algorithm. This algorithm uses the routing table size as one of the parameters while deciding the order in which the packets are transmitted from the source device to the destination device in a virtual router. The port numbers of the source and destination are also recorded in the process. Packets that need to be transmitted are checked for the completeness of the information in the routing table and then sent to their destinations. The systems that are available currently do not consider the size of the routing table while implementing routing algorithms to increase the throughput of the system. While some authors have explored the possibility of incremental deployment for increasing the throughput, it has still not been solved taking the port numbers of source and destination. This paper implements an algorithm called the Route Mapper which makes use of a map table. The map table has all the details about the packet including the information that {{can be found in the}} routing table. Through this research, we can clearly observe that a substantial increase in the throughput of the network can be overserved when the proposed algorithm is implemented...|$|R

50|$|Gross filed {{reports for}} DAI {{of his four}} visits to Cuba in 2009. The report of the fifth and final trip was written by DAI. A review of the reports was {{revealed}} on February 12, 2012, by the Associated Press (AP). According to the reports, Gross {{was aware of the}} risks he was taking. AP reports that Gross did not identify himself {{as a representative of the}} U.S. government, but claimed to be a member of a Jewish humanitarian group is inaccurate. To escape Cuban authorities' detection, he enlisted the help of American Jews to transport electronic equipment, instructing them to pack items a piece at a time in carry-on luggage, and also traveled with American Jewish humanitarian groups undertaking missions on the island so he could intercede with Cuban authorities if questions arose. Gross declared that he was thoroughly inspected by the customs officials at Jose Marti International Airport when entering the country and that he declared all of the items in his possession. The equipment he brought to Cuba on his fourth trip, most but not all of which is legal in Cuba, included 12 iPods, 11 BlackBerry Curve smartphones, three MacBooks, six 500-gigabyte external drives, three satellite modems known as BGANs, three <b>routers,</b> three <b>controllers,</b> 18 wireless access points, 13 memory sticks, three VoIP phones, and networking switches. In his report on this trip, marked as final, he summarized: “Wireless networks established in three communities; about 325 users”. However, he went to Cuba for a fifth time in late November 2009 and was arrested 11 days later. When he was arrested, he was carrying a high-tech chip, intended to keep satellite phone transmissions from being located within 250 mi. The chip is not available on the open market. It is provided most frequently to the CIA and the United States Department of Defense, but can also be obtained by the United States Department of State, which oversees USAID. Asked how Gross obtained the card, a USAID spokesman said that the agency played no role in helping Gross acquire equipment.|$|R
