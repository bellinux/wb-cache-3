5000|$|The [...] "Run language" [...] uses scripted {{forms of}} normal screen {{commands}} on the reports (e.g. the manual SORT and the run-language element @SOR will invoke the same compiled <b>re-entrant</b> <b>code</b> module).|$|E
50|$|These {{changes were}} {{primarily}} {{aimed at improving}} the efficiency of a data stack implementation. If FSR2 is used either as the stack pointer or frame pointer, stack items may be easily indexed allowing more efficient <b>re-entrant</b> <b>code.</b> Microchip's MPLAB C18 C compiler chooses to use FSR2 as a frame pointer.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly thereafter, {{the notion}} of a [...] "program" [...] was {{expanded}} to {{the notion of}} an [...] "executing program and its context". The concept of a process was born, which also became necessary with the invention of <b>re-entrant</b> <b>code.</b> Threads came somewhat later. However, with the advent of concepts such as time-sharing, computer networks, and multiple-CPU shared memory computers, the old [...] "multiprogramming" [...] gave way to true multitasking, multiprocessing and, later, multithreading.|$|E
40|$|TeD is a {{language}} designed mainly for modeling telecommunication networks. The TeD language specification is separated {{into two parts}} [...] - (1) a met{{a language}} (2) an external language. The meta language specification {{is concerned with the}} high [...] level description of the structural and behavioral interfaces of various network elements. The external language specification is concerned with the detailed low-level description of the implementation of the structure and behavior of the network elements. The meta language, called MetaTeD, is described in a separate related document. An external language specification, with C ++ as the external language, is described in this document. A software support system for the development and parallel simulation of TeD models is also described.
