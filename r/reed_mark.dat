5000|$|Laudner {{was never}} able to {{reproduce}} his 1981 season in the majors.

50|$|Some of the ill-effects that {{counterfeit}} money has on society include {{a reduction in}} the value of real money; and increase in prices (inflation) due to more money getting circulated in the economy - an unauthorized artificial increase in the money supply; a decrease in the acceptability of paper money; and losses, when traders are not reimbursed for {{counterfeit money}} detected by banks, even if it is confiscated.Traditionally, anti-counterfeiting measures involved including fine detail with raised intaglio printing on bills which allows non-experts to easily spot forgeries.

50|$|One thread per dent is {{most common}} for coarse work, for finer work (20 or more ends per inch) {{two or more}} threads are put through each dent. Threads can be doubled in every other space, so that a reed with 10 dents per inch could give 15 ends per inch, or 20 if the threads were simply doubled. Also, threads can be put in every other dent {{so as to make}} a cloth with 6 ends per inch from a reed with 12 dents per inch. Putting more than one thread through each dent reduces {{friction}} and the number of reeds that one weaver needs, and is used in weaving mills. If too many threads are put through one dent there may be <b>reed</b> <b>marks</b> left in the fabric, especially in linen and cotton.|$|R
