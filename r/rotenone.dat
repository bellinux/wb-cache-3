5|$|Pesticides {{derived from}} plants include nicotine, <b>rotenone,</b> {{strychnine}} and pyrethrins. Plants such as tobacco, cannabis, opium poppy, and coca yield psychotropic chemicals. Poisons from plants include atropine, ricin, hemlock and curare, {{though many of}} these also have medicinal uses.|$|E
5|$|Like many ancient {{medicinal}} plants (Pliny the Elder describes {{it in his}} Naturalis Historia), great mullein was linked to witches, although the relationship remained generally ambiguous, and the plant was also widely held to ward off curses and evil spirits. The seeds contain several compounds (saponins, glycosides, coumarin, <b>rotenone)</b> that are toxic to fish, and {{have been widely used}} as piscicide for fishing.|$|E
5|$|Oil {{from the}} flowers was used against catarrhs, colics and, in Germany, earaches, frostbite, eczema and other {{external}} conditions. Topical application of various V.thapsus-based preparations was recommended {{for the treatment}} of warts, boils, carbuncles, hemorrhoids, and chilblains, amongst others. Recent studies have found that great mullein contains glycyrrhizin compounds with bactericide and potential anti-tumoral action. These compounds are concentrated in the flowers. The German Commission E sanctioned medicinal use of the plant for catarrhs. It was also part of the National Formulary in the United States and United Kingdom. The plant's leaves, in addition to the seeds, have been reported to contain <b>rotenone,</b> although quantities are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The primary food of Galapagos {{sharks are}} benthic bony fishes (including eels, sea bass, flatfish, flatheads, and triggerfish) and octopuses. They also {{occasionally}} take surface-dwelling prey such as mackerel, flyingfish, and squid. As the sharks grow larger, they consume {{increasing numbers of}} elasmobranchs (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage. At the Galapagos Islands, this species has been observed attacking Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), and marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). While collecting fishes at Clipperton Island, Limbaugh (1963) noted that juvenile Galapagos sharks surrounded the boat, with multiple individuals rushing at virtually anything trailing {{in the water and}} striking the boat bottom, oars, and marker buoys. The sharks were not slowed by <b>rotenone</b> (a fish toxin) or shark repellent, and some followed the boat into water so shallow that their backs were exposed.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{more than}} 50 {{years of study}} of complex I, no inhibitors {{blocking}} the electron flow inside the enzyme have been found. Hydrophobic inhibitors like <b>rotenone</b> or piericidin most likely disrupt the electron transfer between the terminal FeS cluster N2 and ubiquinone. It {{has been shown that}} long-term systemic inhibition of complex I by <b>rotenone</b> can induce selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.|$|E
25|$|Industrial farmed legumes include Indigofera, {{cultivated}} for {{the production}} of indigo, Acacia, for gum arabic, and Derris, for the insecticide action of <b>rotenone,</b> a compound it produces.|$|E
25|$|The {{tragedy of}} a group of drug addicts in California in the early 1980s who {{consumed}} a contaminated and illicitly produced batch of the synthetic opiate MPPP brought to light MPTP as a cause of parkinsonian symptoms. Other predominant toxin-based models employ the insecticide <b>rotenone,</b> the herbicide paraquat, and the fungicide maneb. Models based on toxins are most commonly used in primates. Transgenic rodent models also exist.|$|E
25|$|Sugar beet is an {{important}} source of sugar. Yam roots are a source of estrogen compounds used in birth control pills. The fish poison and insecticide <b>rotenone</b> is obtained from roots of Lonchocarpus spp. Important medicines from roots are ginseng, aconite, ipecac, gentian and reserpine. Several legumes that have nitrogen-fixing root nodules are used as green manure crops, which provide nitrogen fertilizer for other crops when plowed under. Specialized bald cypress roots, termed knees, are sold as souvenirs, lamp bases and carved into folk art. Native Americans used the flexible roots of white spruce for basketry.|$|E
25|$|Highway A was reopened {{during the}} last week of November 2008. Water began flowing back into Lake Delton after the dam was closed in early December 2008. An {{official}} ceremony was held for December 5, 2008, for both the Highway A reconstruction and the Dam projects. Additionally, <b>rotenone</b> was used to kill carp prior to the commencement of refilling. In February 2009, it was announced that the lake was expected to be refilled by Memorial Day weekend. Costs to the State of Wisconsin were said to be $3.6 million and $2.5 million was spent by the village of Lake Delton.|$|E
500|$|PD is {{not known}} to occur {{naturally}} in any species other than humans, although animal models which show some features of the disease are used in research. The appearance of parkinsonism {{in a group of}} drug addicts in the early 1980s who consumed a contaminated batch of the synthetic opiate MPPP led to the discovery of the chemical MPTP as an agent that causes parkinsonism in non-human primates as well as in humans. Other predominant toxin-based models employ the insecticide <b>rotenone,</b> the herbicide paraquat and the fungicide maneb. Models based on toxins are most commonly used in primates. [...] Transgenic rodent models that replicate various aspects of PD have been developed. Using the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine, also known as 6-OHDA, it creates a model of Parkinson's disease in rats by targeting and destroying dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway when injected into the substantia nigra.|$|E
500|$|Some {{fisheries}} {{are focused}} on removing rainbow trout in order to reestablish native trout populations. [...] This {{can be done by}} poisoning rivers with chemicals such as [...] antimycin or <b>rotenone</b> which have been declared safe [...] in the USA by the Environmental Protection Agency. [...] Once the chemicals have dissipated native trout are [...] released into the river. [...] Another method is to use electrofishing which enable the fish to be caught alive and harvested or re-located. [...] This technique has been used in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park to rid it of rainbow trout that were introduced in the 1930s and have thrived ever since. [...] They are hoping to re-establish native brook trout in {{at least some of the}} 2100-mile river system. Neither method of control is 100% effective and are best regarded as methods to change the relative population sizes of fish species.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} known since the late 17th century that plants contain [...] {{chemicals}} which are avoided by insects. These chemicals {{have been used by}} man as early insecticides; in 1690 nicotine was extracted from tobacco and used as a contact insecticide. In 1773, insect infested plants were treated with nicotine fumigation by heating tobacco and blowing the smoke over the plants. The flowers of Chrysanthemum species contain pyrethrin which is a potent insecticide. In later years, the applications of plant resistance became an important area of research in agriculture and plant breeding, particularly because they can serve as a safe and low-cost alternative to the use of pesticides. The important role of secondary plant substances in plant defense was described in the late 1950s by Vincent Dethier and G.S. Fraenkel. The use of botanical pesticides is widespread and notable examples include Azadirachtin from the neem (Azadirachta indica), d-Limonene from Citrus species, <b>Rotenone</b> from Derris, Capsaicin from chili pepper and Pyrethrum.|$|E
2500|$|Bullatacin (an acetogenin {{found in}} Asimina triloba fruit) {{is the most}} potent known {{inhibitor}} of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) (IC50=1.2 nM, stronger than <b>rotenone).</b> [...] The best-known inhibitor of complex I is <b>rotenone</b> (commonly used as an organic pesticide). <b>Rotenone</b> and rotenoids are isoflavonoids occurring in several genera of tropical plants such as Antonia (Loganiaceae), Derris and Lonchocarpus (Faboideae, Fabaceae). There have been reports of the indigenous people of French Guiana using rotenone-containing plants to fish - due to its ichthyotoxic effect - {{as early as the}} 17th century. <b>Rotenone</b> binds to the ubiquinone binding site of complex I as well as piericidin A, another potent inhibitor with a close structural homologue to ubiquinone.|$|E
2500|$|Acetogenins from Annonaceae {{are even}} more potent inhibitors of complex I. [...] They {{cross-link}} to the ND2 subunit, which suggests that ND2 is essential for quinone-binding. Interestingly, Rolliniastatin-2, an acetogenin, is the first complex I inhibitor found that does not share the same binding site as <b>rotenone.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Since before 2000 BC, {{humans have}} {{utilized}} pesticides {{to protect their}} crops. The first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia. The Rig Veda, which is about 4,000 years old, mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control. By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury, and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemums, and <b>rotenone,</b> which {{is derived from the}} roots of tropical vegetables. Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant. [...] Paul MÃ¼ller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide. Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by [...] "triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate".|$|E
2500|$|Lake of the Woods was stocked for {{the first}} time in 1913. [...] This {{introduced}} hatchery-breed rainbow trout into the lake. [...] This stocking produced a decade of good trout fishing. [...] In 1922, the Oregon State Game Commission (a predecessor to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife) stocked the lake with largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, yellow perch, warmouth, pumpkinseed sunfish, [...] brown bullheads, carp, and perhaps suckers. [...] The yellow perch quickly became the lake's dominant species, out-competing the trout for both food and habitat. [...] Between 1925 and 1935, brook trout, cutthroat trout, chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead were also introduced into the lake. [...] No additional rainbow trout were stocked until 1946. [...] The trout population remained relatively stable until about 1938 when the salmonid populations began to decline, probably due to competition from the warm water species combined with limited spawning areas and increasing fishing. [...] Despite the Game Commission's efforts to control the warm water species, their population continued to proliferate while the salmonid species declined. [...] In 1955, the entire lake was poisoned with <b>rotenone,</b> killing all the fish in the lake. [...] The lake was then restocked with rainbow trout, brook trout, and kokanee salmon.|$|E
50|$|The lowest {{lethal dose}} {{for a child}} is 143 mg/kg. Human deaths from <b>rotenone</b> {{poisoning}} are rare because its irritating action causes vomiting. Deliberate ingestion of <b>rotenone</b> can be fatal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rotenone</b> is {{classified}} by the World Health Organization as moderately hazardous. It is mildly toxic to humans and other mammals, but extremely toxic to insects and aquatic life, including fish. This higher toxicity in fish and insects {{is because the}} lipophilic <b>rotenone</b> is easily taken up through the gills or trachea, but not as easily through the skin or the gastrointestinal tract. <b>Rotenone</b> is toxic to erythrocytes in vitro.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rotenone</b> was {{implemented}} in 2010 to kill an invasive goldfish population present in Mann Lake, {{with the intention}} of not disrupting the lake's trout population. <b>Rotenone</b> successfully achieved these aims, killing nearly 200,000 goldfish, and only three trout.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, injecting <b>rotenone</b> into rats was {{reported}} to cause the development of symptoms {{similar to those of}} Parkinson's disease (PD). <b>Rotenone</b> was continuously applied over a period of five weeks, mixed with DMSO and PEG to enhance tissue penetration, and injected into the jugular vein. [...] The study does not directly suggest <b>rotenone</b> exposure is responsible for PD in humans, but is consistent with the belief that chronic exposure to environmental toxins increases the likelihood of the disease.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, another {{animal model}} for Parkinson's disease was found. It was {{shown that the}} {{pesticide}} and insecticide <b>rotenone</b> causes Parkinsonism in rats by killing dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Like MPP+, <b>rotenone</b> also interferes with complex I of the electron transport chain.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rotenone</b> is a {{powerful}} insecticide {{that was used to}} control insects (LD50: 132 mg/kg). Despite the high toxicity of <b>Rotenone</b> to aquatic life and some links to Parkinson disease the compound is still allowed in organic farming as it is a naturally occurring compound.|$|E
5000|$|CubÃ© resin, {{the root}} extract from Barbasco and from cubÃ© (Lonchocarpus utilis), {{is used as}} a {{commercial}} insecticide and piscicide (fish poison). The major active ingredients are <b>rotenone</b> and deguelin. Although [...] "organic" [...] (produced by nature) <b>rotenone</b> is no longer considered an environmentally safe chemical.|$|E
50|$|The best-known {{inhibitor}} {{of complex}} I is <b>rotenone</b> (commonly {{used as an}} organic pesticide). <b>Rotenone</b> and rotenoids are isoflavonoids occurring in several genera of tropical plants such as Antonia (Loganiaceae), Derris and Lonchocarpus (Faboideae, Fabaceae).

50|$|Naturally derived {{insecticides}} {{allowed for}} use on organic farms use include Bacillus thuringiensis (a bacterial toxin), pyrethrum (a chrysanthemum extract), spinosad (a bacterial metabolite), neem (a tree extract) and <b>rotenone</b> (a legume root extract). Fewer than 10% of organic farmers use these pesticides regularly; one survey found that only 5.3% of vegetable growers in California use <b>rotenone</b> while 1.7% use pyrethrum. These pesticides are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm. The main criterion for organic pesticides {{is that they are}} naturally derived, and some naturally derived substances have been controversial. Controversial natural pesticides include <b>rotenone,</b> copper, nicotine sulfate, and pyrethrums <b>Rotenone</b> and pyrethrum are particularly controversial because they work by attacking the nervous system, like most conventional insecticides. <b>Rotenone</b> is extremely toxic to fish and can induce symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease in mammals. Although pyrethrum (natural pyrethrins) is more effective against insects when used with piperonyl butoxide (which retards degradation of the pyrethrins), organic standards generally do not permit use of the latter substance.|$|E
50|$|Small-scale {{sampling}} with <b>rotenone</b> {{is used by}} fish researchers {{studying the}} biodiversity of marine fishes to collect cryptic, or hidden, fishes, which represent {{an important component of}} shoreline fish communities. <b>Rotenone</b> is the most effective tool available because only small quantities are necessary. It has only minor and transient environmental side effects.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species in}} the genus are poisonous, {{particularly}} to fish, for their high concentration of <b>rotenone.</b> The black seeds of Tephrosia species have historically been used by indigenous cultures as fish toxins. In the last century, several Tephrosia species have been studied {{in connection with the}} use of <b>rotenone</b> as an insecticide and pesticide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rotenone</b> has {{historically}} been used by indigenous peoples to catch fish. Typically, rotenone-containing plants in the Fabaceae family of legumes are crushed and introduced into a body of water, and as <b>rotenone</b> interferes with cellular respiration, the affected fish rise to the surface {{in an attempt to}} gulp air, where they are more easily caught.|$|E
50|$|Examples of piscicides include <b>rotenone,</b> saponins, TFM, {{niclosamide}} and Antimycin A (Fintrol).|$|E
50|$|Their ashes {{are used}} as a salt substitute. HCN and <b>rotenone</b> are present.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rotenone</b> {{is used as}} a pesticide, insecticide, and as a nonselective {{piscicide}} (fish killer).|$|E
50|$|Despite {{more than}} 50 {{years of study}} of complex I, no inhibitors {{blocking}} the electron flow inside the enzyme have been found.
