25|$|In {{the months}} after WrestleMania, Hemme began a feud with Victoria, {{who claimed to be}} jealous of the {{opportunities}} afforded to Hemme. Hemme would feud with Victoria during <b>Raw</b> <b>house</b> shows, and defeated her on several occasions. On the June 6 episode of Raw, Hemme teamed up with Rosey and The Hurricane in a losing effort to Victoria and The Heart Throbs (Antonio and Romeo) in a six-person mixed tag team match. The feud culminated in a bout at Vengeance on June 26, which Victoria won. With her feud with Victoria over, Hemme briefly aligned herself with Eugene, before she and Stacy Keibler were traded to the SmackDown! brand in exchange for Candice Michelle and Torrie Wilson, on August 25.|$|E

5000|$|Bežigrad is {{primarily}} a residential district. Along Vienna Street there are some sections with high concentrations of shops and businesses. There is a small industrial zone in the northwest part of the district. Its buildings are generally low (up to six floors), and single-family dwellings and <b>raw</b> <b>houses</b> predominate. Larger communities of apartment buildings are concentrated on the district's eastern edge, in Nove Stožice and the Sava Development.

Original small-area, monthly, quality-adjusted house price index series are developed from <b>raw</b> <b>housing</b> transaction observations {{for a number of}} UK counties and cities. These series are then tested in an autoregressive setting for characteristics indicative of weak market efficiency and seasonality. The major conclusion drawn is that there exists little evidence to support notions of inefficiency in these markets over the period considered. Copyright 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{argue that}} the name comes from the Scottish Gaelic An t-Sròn Reamhar meaning [...] "The Fat Nose", but which more prosaically might be {{rendered}} as [...] "the broad headland". The most commonly accepted explanation is that it derives {{its name from the}} strand or burn which divides the row, <b>raw,</b> of <b>houses</b> on its banks. (The town burn, now under the two Strand streets.) In time Strandraw was named and spelled Stranrawer, and afterwards Stranraer.|$|R
60|$|The {{volume of}} its water {{decreased}} abruptly--I suppose the new drainage works that linked us up with Beckington, {{and made me}} first acquainted with the geological quality of the London clay, {{had to do with}} that--until only a weak uncleansing trickle remained. That at first did not strike me as a misfortune. An adventurous small boy might walk dryshod in places hitherto inaccessible. But hard upon that came the pegs, the planks and carts and devastation. Roper's meadows, being no longer in fear of floods, were now to be slashed out into parallelograms of untidy road, and built upon with rows of working-class cottages. The roads came,--horribly; the houses followed. They seemed to rise in the night. People moved into them as soon as the roofs were on, mostly workmen and their young wives, and already in a year some of these <b>raw</b> <b>houses</b> stood empty again from defaulting tenants, with windows broken and wood-work warping and rotting. The Ravensbrook became a dump for old iron, rusty cans, abandoned boots and the like, and was a river only when unusual rains filled it for a day or so with an inky flood of surface water....|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{intends to}} {{identify}} the chronology of compact city plan in Pakistan, where the grid is used to overlap the mixed used settlements. Theoretically {{there is little evidence}} that axial approaches are more accurate due to the module of the brick which is laid out in straight line for walls as hypothesized in the Harappa civilization, instead the square rectangular blocks appearing at Harappa. However, no study has combined the method accurately that the <b>raw</b> <b>houses</b> are constructed and streets are formulated at Harappa rectangular because they are based on the grid pattern due to its unit basic component brick proportion system. The grid iron is the negative space similar to mortar; the wall gives a grid pattern in elevation or Y-axis, where as the grid iron is on X-axis on the plan form. Concerning methodology the two pronged theory has been devised for this research. On the one hand the theoretical underpinning of the concept and realistic field survey was evolved whereas; on the other hand, analytical and evaluative steps were conducted to reach the realities of topology and typology. The tools and techniques used in documentation and analysis include map making using Depth map and Google Earth. For field photography, personal site visits were carried out with hired professional photographers. There were chronological sites that were visited, documented and traced for the evolution o...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} basic {{configurations}} {{in which these}} agents are stored. The first are self-contained munitions like projectiles, cartridges, mines, and rockets; these can contain propellant and/or explosive components. The next form are aircraft-delivered munitions. This form never has an explosive component. Together they comprise the two forms that have been weaponized and are ready for their intended use. The U.S. stockpile consisted of 39% of these weapon ready munitions. The final of the three forms are <b>raw</b> agent <b>housed</b> in one-ton containers. The remaining 61% of the stockpile was in this form. Whereas these chemicals exist in liquid form at normal room temperature, the sulfur mustards H, and HD freeze in temperatures below 55 F. Mixing lewisite with distilled mustard lowers the freezing point to -13 F.|$|R

50|$|The {{increasing}} economic {{influence of}} the burghs attracted further English, Fleming and Scandinavian immigration. As the economic power of the burghs grew, Gaelic-speakers from the hinterland found it advantageous to acquire a working knowledge of English. The institutional language of the burghs consisted of vocabulary that was Germanic in origin, such English terms as toft (homestead and land), croft (smallholding), ruid (land let by a burgh), guild (a trade association), bow (an arched gateway), wynd (lane) and <b>raw</b> (row of <b>houses).</b>|$|R
5|$|Several {{studies of}} the house sparrow in {{temperate}} agricultural areas have found the proportion of seeds in its diet to be about 90%. It will eat almost any seeds, but where it has a choice, it prefers oats and wheat. In urban areas, the house sparrow feeds largely on food provided directly or indirectly by humans, such as bread, though it prefers <b>raw</b> seeds. The <b>house</b> sparrow also eats some plant matter besides seeds, including buds, berries, and fruits such as grapes and cherries. In temperate areas, the house sparrow has an unusual habit of tearing flowers, especially yellow ones, in the spring.|$|R

[...] Stephen Worthy, writing in Mixmag, called it [...] "their most rounded, consistently engaging record yet", and in a separate review for Mojo, he added that [...] "their reunion album fizzes with energy—although it retains the underlying melancholia that defined their previous work." ...|$|R

Since James pinned Victoria and not Melina, an immediate rematch was scheduled, in which James dropped the title back to Melina, {{giving her the}} shortest Women’s Championship reign in WWE history. James later received a rematch for the title at Backlash, but was unsuccessful. After Backlash, James would only make sporadic appearances on television, wrestling occasionally in tag-matches and rarely in singles competition. On the November 26 episode of Raw, James defeated Melina in a number one contender's match for Beth Phoenix's Women's Championship, setting up a title match between the two at Armageddon, in which Phoenix retained the title.|$|R
