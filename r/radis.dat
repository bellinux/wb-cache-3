Koxinga followed his advice and the Dutch redoubt fell within a day. This claim of a Swiss defector only appears in a post hoc account of the siege written by Frederick Coyett, whom scholars have noted sought to absolve the author of responsibility for the defeat. Ming records make no mention of any defector or Swiss named Hans Jurgen <b>Radis.</b> On January 12, 1662, Koxinga's fleet initiated another bombardment, while the ground force prepared to assault the fort.

The frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on May 17, 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them, and by destroying their Christian school textbooks. On 1 February 1662, the Dutch Governor of Formosa, Frederik Coyett, surrendered Fort Zeelandia to Koxinga. According to Frederick Coyett's own self-justifying account written after the siege, Koxinga's life was saved {{at the end of the}} siege by a certain Hans Jurgen <b>Radis</b> of Stockaert, a Dutch defector who strongly advised him against visiting the ramparts of the fort after he had taken it, which <b>Radis</b> knew would be blown up by the retreating Dutch forces.

40|$|International audienceThe PPR-B gene is {{responsible}} for male-fertility restoration of the Ogura-type male-sterile radish plants, and it {{is located in the}} complex Rfo locus in the vicinity of similar PPR-A gene and PPR-C pseudogene. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify PPR-B alleles and understand the structure of the Rfo locus in radish breeding lines. Five lines of radish with normal male-fertile cytoplasm were tested. The entire PPR-B gene was amplified, sequenced and allelic PPR-B sequences were identified. The results indicated that the maintainer lines 7, 15 and 21 contained a non-restoring form of PPR-B protein. A unique PPR-B was found in lines 24 / 15 and 31 that are restorer and maintainer lines, respectively. The substitutions might be responsible for the loss of a restoring function of the PPR-B- 31 allele. Amplification of the PPR-A/PPR-B and PPR-B/PPR-C intergenic regions allowed to identify rearrangements within Rfo locus. Obtained results confirm the wide allelic variation within the Rfo locus, as well as high genetic complexity of the fertility restoration mechanism in <b>radis...</b>|$|E
40|$|The present pap er {{investigates the}} {{phenomenon}} of antonym canonicity by providing new behavioural and distributional evidence on Italian adjectives. Previous studies have showed that some pairs of antonyms {{are perceived to be}} better examples of opposition than others, and are so considered representative of the whole category (e. g., Deese, 1964; Murphy, 2003; Paradis et al., 2009). Our goal is to further investigate why such canonical pairs (Murphy, 2003) exist and how they come to be associated. In the literature, two dif ferent approaches have dealt with this issue. The lexical - categorical approach (Charles and Miller, 1989; Justeson and Katz, 1991) finds the cause of canonicity in the high co - occurrence frequency of the two adjectives. The cognitive - prototype approach (Pa <b>radis</b> et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2012) instead claims that two adjectives form a canonical pair because they are aligned along a simple and salient dimension. Our empirical evidence, while supporting the latter view, shows that the paradigmatic distributi onal properties of adjectives can also contribute to explain {{the phenomenon of}} canonicity, providing a corpus - based correlate of the cognitive notion of salience...|$|E

We then propose a setup for measuring the resulting geometric phase change of electronic wave functions in such a mechanical nanostructure.

The propagation of waves in curved waveguides can be ’translated ’ for quantum particles into a Hamiltonian consisting of the kinetic energy operator and a resulting potential energy, which is of pure geometric origin. The ability to build nanostructures with a threedimensional relief allows the realization of low-dimensional electronic systems possessing a mechanical degree of freedom [2]. This is exemplified in recent work by Prinz et al. [3] and Schmidt and Eberl [4], who demonstrated how to realize rolled-up semiconductor films with a <b>radis</b> of curvature R ∼ 100 nm.
