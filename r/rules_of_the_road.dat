25|$|<b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> {{and driving}} {{etiquette}} are the general practices and procedures that road users {{are required to}} follow. These rules usually apply to all road users, though they are of special importance to motorists and cyclists. These rules govern interactions between vehicles and with pedestrians. The basic traffic rules are defined by an international treaty {{under the authority of}} the United Nations, the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. Not all countries are signatory to the convention and, even among signatories, local variations in practice may be found. There are also unwritten local <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> which are generally understood by local drivers.|$|E

25|$|Traffic {{on roads}} {{consists}} of road users including pedestrians, ridden or herded animals, vehicles, streetcars, buses and other conveyances, either singly or together, while using the public way {{for purposes of}} travel. Traffic laws are the laws which govern traffic and regulate vehicles, while <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> are both the laws and the informal rules that may have developed over time to facilitate the orderly and timely flow of traffic.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the fall}} of Communism in Poland in 1989, the main topics and {{sometimes}} even specific adventures of the comics were not chosen by Chmielewski himself, but rather by his publishers.

In a compromise solution, he created a board game about traffic laws, which was included {{in the middle of the}} book.|$|E
50|$|The terms {{right-hand}} traffic (RHT) and left-hand traffic (LHT) {{refer to}} regulations requiring all bidirectional traffic, unless otherwise directed, {{to keep to}} the right or to <b>the</b> left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> respectively.

The accident happened at the PUTCO depot where three buses had stopped when a fourth hit a bus from behind, causing each one to ram the vehicle in front of it. The provincial minister said to the press that both accidents {{could have been avoided}} if the drivers followed the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and the buses were in a roadworthy condition. The Mpumalanga Roads and Transport Department met staff from PUTCO to discuss the condition of some of the company's buses.|$|E
25|$|As Commerce Secretary, Hoover also hosted two {{national}} conferences on street traffic, in 1924 and 1926 (a third convened in 1930, during Hoover's presidency). Collectively the meetings were called the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety. Hoover's chief {{objective was to}} address the growing casualty toll of traffic accidents, but the scope grew and soon embraced motor vehicle standards, <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> and urban traffic control. He left the invited interest groups to negotiate agreements among themselves, which were then presented for adoption by states and localities. Because automotive trade associations were the best organized, many of the positions taken by the conferences reflected their interests. The conferences issued a model Uniform Vehicle Code for adoption by the states, and a Model Municipal Traffic Ordinance for adoption by cities. Both were widely influential, promoting greater uniformity between jurisdictions and tending to promote the automobile's priority in city streets.|$|E

2500|$|Traffic is {{formally}} {{organized in}} many jurisdictions, with marked lanes, junctions, intersections, interchanges, traffic signals, or signs. Traffic is often classified by type: heavy motor vehicle (e.g., car, truck), other vehicle (e.g., moped, bicycle), and pedestrian. [...] Different classes may share speed limits and easement, {{or may be}} segregated. Some jurisdictions may have very detailed and complex <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> while others rely more on drivers' common sense and willingness to cooperate.|$|E
2500|$|At Ashland Avenue {{the river}} widens {{to form the}} U.S. Turning Basin, {{the west bank of}} which was the {{starting}} point of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Prior to 1983, this was where the US Coast Guard <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road,</b> Great Lakes ended & <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road,</b> Western Rivers began. Since 1983, there is just a single Inland Navigational Rules passed by Congressional Act in 1980 (Public Law 96-591). At the basin the river is joined by a tributary, the South Fork of the river, which is commonly given the nickname Bubbly Creek. A bridge used to span the South Fork at this point that was too low for boats to pass meaning that their cargo needed to be unloaded at the bridge, and the neighborhood at its east end became known as Bridgeport. The river continues to the south west, entering the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal at Damen Avenue. The original West Fork of the South Branch, which before 1935 [...] led towards Mud Lake and the Chicago Portage, has been filled in; a triangular intrusion into the north bank at Damen Avenue marks the place where it diverged from the course of the canal. From there, the water flows down the canal through the southwest side of Chicago and southwestern suburbs and, in time, into the Des Plaines River between Crest Hill on the west and Lockport on the east, just north of the border between Crest Hill and Joliet, Illinois, eventually reaching the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{copyright}} © 1999 Ian Watson. It {{may be used}} for non-commercial personal In 1919, 104 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world’s territories drove on the left and 104 on the right. Between 1919 and 1986, 34 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> keep-left territories changed to keep-right. No territories shifted in the opposite direction. This paper tests and largely sustains the counterintuitive hypothesis that the reason all changes were in one direction was less that there was any difference between keep-left and keepright as rules, and more that <b>the</b> geographical position <b>of</b> many keep-left territories happened to put them under pressure to change from keep-right neighbors. This paper also discusses six other potential explanations of change, most of which played some role as well. Finally, it shows that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is an example of standardization and convention. <b>The</b> explanations <b>of</b> change proposed for <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> are familiar from many other cases of standardization. ...|$|R
50|$|The United States Virgin Islands is {{the only}} place under United States {{jurisdiction}} where <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is to drive on the left. This was inherited from what was the then-current Danish practice at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American acquisition in 1917. However, because St. Thomas is a U.S. territory, most cars are imported from the mainland United States and therefore the steering column is located on <b>the</b> left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle.|$|R

Locals employed by Germans were also paid in the Occupation Reichsmarks.|$|R
2500|$|Studies of {{the actions}} of each ship confirm another factor which was long suspected, that once sight contact was established, the SS Andrea Doria took an evasive action which {{increased}} the likelihood of a collision and worsened the situation. In other words, the Italian ship turned to its left, and subsequently the Swedish turned to its right, which {{in the case of an}} impending collision meant that they turned towards each other. The best way to avoid a collision is for both parties to turn away, by both going to their [...] "left" [...] or both going [...] "right." [...] Hence, the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> specify the direction a ship should turn; if both ships follow the same avoidance rules, then they minimize the chance of a collision.|$|E
