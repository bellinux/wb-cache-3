50|$|The <b>re-routing</b> of the <b>line</b> and the {{increase}} in traffic meant that a new station was built at the current location in 1873. The station building of 1873 was destroyed in an air raid on Heilbronn on 4 December 1944. Today's station was built on its foundations.|$|R
5000|$|Porte d'Auteuil is also {{connected}} with Porte de Saint-Cloud of line 9. This connection is called [...] "voie Murat" [...] and it passes the ghost station Porte Molitor. The station {{was meant for}} spectators leaving the Parc des Princes football stadium, but plans were changed {{and access to the}} station from the streets was never constructed. Westbound trains on line 10 (terminating at Porte d'Auteuil) can be <b>re-routed</b> to <b>line</b> 9, starting eastbound at Porte de Saint-Cloud via the [...] "voie Murat" [...] connection. This option is used after events at Parc des Princes when Line 9 is used by unusually many people.|$|R
50|$|On 3 November 1955 the Rimutaka Incline was {{replaced}} by the Rimutaka Tunnel, speeding travel from the Hutt Valley to the Wairarapa. This involved <b>re-routing</b> the Wairarapa <b>Line</b> north of Upper Hutt.

5|$|In 2011 Metro began {{studying}} {{the needs of}} the system through 2040. New Metro rail lines and extensions under consideration as part of this long term plan include: a new line which parallels the Capital Beltway; a new line from the Friendship Heights Metro station to White Oak, Maryland, which would pass through the District and Silver Spring; an extension of the Green Line to National Harbor in Maryland; and <b>re-routing</b> the Blue <b>Line</b> in the District between the Orange Line and Green Line. None of these lines are yet funded for planning or construction.|$|R
5000|$|The Green Line's eastern {{terminus}} also {{suffers from}} the fact that it stops two miles (3 km) just short of the heavily used Norwalk/Santa Fe Springs Metrolink station, where several Metrolink lines operate. Local bus service is provided between the Metrolink station and the Green Line terminus, but schedules are not coordinated with the Green Line arrivals. Because of this, and the Green <b>Line's</b> <b>re-routed</b> western alignment away from LAX, critics have labeled the Green Line as a train that goes [...] "from nowhere to nowhere." [...] The Green Line is currently the only Metro rail line not to serve Downtown Los Angeles. Transfers to the Blue Line can be made at the Willowbrook Station by downtown-bound riders.|$|R
50|$|Service {{over the}} bridge was diminished in phases. Numerous station were taken out of use and the {{mainline}} was retracted in 1935. By 1966 service on the New York and Greenwood Lake was terminated. In 1976, the Erie-Lackawanna {{was taken over by}} Conrail which continued to run Boonton Line trains {{over the bridge}}. New Jersey Transit Rail Operations (NJT) took over Conrail's commuter lines in 1983. With the 2002 opening of the Montclair Connection, NJT <b>re-routed</b> the Boonton <b>Line</b> to its Montclair Branch east of Montclair, thus bypassing the ROW to the bridge. Service was discontinued to Rowe Street, Benson Street and Arlington stations. DB Draw over the Hackensack River in was also taken out of use and left in the open position.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} {{station was}} abandoned because {{the construction of}} the Pinnacle Bank Arena required the <b>re-routing</b> of railway <b>lines</b> away from it. The new station cost $1.3 million. Designed by Sinclair Hille Architects, the building is composed of brick pavilions linked by a central waiting room. A large, curved skylight in the waiting room is meant to evoke the great vaulted spaces of many historic stations. One pavilion houses the restrooms while the other holds the ticket office, baggage room, and a space for train crews. Across from the ticket office is a large photo mural depicting steam and streamlined locomotives against an antique map of Nebraska. A tall, lighted pylon with “Lincoln” spelled vertically down its front serves as a beacon for approaching travelers.|$|R
