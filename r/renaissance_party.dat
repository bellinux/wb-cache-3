25|$|After an Islamic <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party</b> {{member was}} allowed to visit Iran by the Iranian {{government}} a diplomatic protest was made by Tajikistan.|$|E
25|$|Due to an {{increase}} in the number of polygamous marriages, proposals were made in Tajikistan to re-legalize polygamy. Tajik women who want to be second wives particularly support decriminalizing polygyny. Mukhiddin Kabiri, the Deputy Chairman of the Islamic <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party</b> of Tajikistan, says that legislation is unlikely to stop the growth in polygyny. He criticizes the ruling élite for speaking out against the practice while taking more than one wife themselves.|$|E
50|$|<b>Renaissance</b> <b>Parties</b> {{were held}} with local and {{international}} DJs every year bringing {{the sounds of the}} UK club and record label to Australia.|$|R
50|$|Usmon was a field {{commander}} for the United Tajik Opposition {{during the}} Tajikistan Civil War of the 1990s. A former Economics Minister, {{he was the}} Islamic <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party's</b> candidate in the 1991 and 1999 presidential elections. He lost the election to incumbent president, Emomalii Rahmon, gaining only 2.1% of the vote amidst criticism that the election was not free and fair.|$|R

25|$|The Al-Wasat Party, a {{moderate}} Islamic {{offshoot of the}} Muslim Brotherhood, was officially approved as a party on 19 February, fifteen years after its foundation. After withdrawing from the Democratic Alliance for Egypt, it formed an electoral coalition with the <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party</b> and the Pioneer Party, {{both of which were}} founded by former members of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Al-Wasat Party fielded {{the overwhelming majority of the}} coalition candidates, all of which ran under the Al-Wasat Party label.|$|E
25|$|Like their {{counterparts}} {{elsewhere in the}} Islamic world in general, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood has influenced the Tunisian Islamists. One of the notable organization that was influenced and inspired by the Brotherhood is Ennahda (The Revival or <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party),</b> which is Tunisia's major Islamist political grouping. An Islamist founded the organization in 1981. While studying in Damascus and Paris, Rashid Ghannouchi embraced {{the ideology of the}} Muslim Brotherhood, which he disseminated on his return to Tunisia.|$|E
25|$|Ben Ali {{initially}} {{took some}} steps to liberalise the regime. He dismantled the personality cult surrounding his predecessor. He also amended {{the constitution to}} limit the president {{to a total of}} three five-year terms, with no more than two in a row. In 1988, several Islamist activists were released from prison. He also forged a national pact with the Tunisian party Harakat al-Ittijah al-Islami (Islamic Tendency Movement), which had been founded in 1981; later it changed its name to Ennahda (the <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party).</b> He also changed the ruling party's name to the Democratic Constitutional Rally.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 also, Samy Gemayel and (most of) his Loubnanouna companions {{rejoined the}} Kataeb, {{prompting}} a <b>renaissance</b> in the <b>party.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{election}} was contested by two alliances, Horizon Monaco and Union Monégasque, {{as well as}} <b>Renaissance,</b> a <b>party</b> whose candidates were all employees of SBM. Horizon Monaco was an alliance of Rassemblement et Enjeux, the Union for the Principality and Synergie Monegasque, whilst Union Monégasque consisted of the Union de Monégasques and the National Union for the Future of Monaco. A total of 72 candidates contested the election.|$|R
5000|$|Ba'ath, also spelled as Ba'th or Baath, means resurrection or <b>renaissance.</b> The <b>party's</b> motto, [...] "Unity, Liberty, Socialism" [...] (wahda, hurriya, ishtirakiya), was {{inspired}} by the French Jacobin political doctrine linking national unity and social equity. In the slogan, [...] "unity" [...] refers to Arab unity, [...] "liberty" [...] emphasizes being free from foreign control and interference, and [...] "socialism" [...] refers to Arab socialism, not European-style Marxism or communism.|$|R
25|$|In 1988, Ben Ali tried a new tack with {{reference}} to the government and Islam, by attempting to reaffirm the country's Islamic identity; several Islamist activists were released from prison. He also forged a national pact with the Tunisian party Harakat al-Ittijah al-Islami (Islamic Tendency Movement), which had been founded in 1981; later it changed its name to an-Nahda (the <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party).</b> But Ben Ali's innovative tack did not work out. Subsequently, An-Nahda claimed to have run strongly in the 1989 elections, which gave the appearance of being unfair; reports often described pro-government votes at over 90%. Ben Ali subsequently banned Islamist political parties and jailed as many as 8,000 activists.|$|E
25|$|Alawites {{initially}} opposed {{a united}} Syrian state (since they thought {{their status as}} a religious minority would endanger them), and Hafez's father shared this belief. As the French left Syria, many Syrians mistrusted Alawites because of their alignment with France. Hafez left his Alawite village, beginning his education at age nine in Sunni-dominated Latakia. He {{was the first in}} his family to attend high school, but in Latakia Assad faced Sunni anti-Alawite bias. He was an excellent student, winning several prizes at about age 14. Assad lived in a poor, predominantly Alawite part of Latakia; to fit in, he approached political parties that welcomed Alawites. These parties (which also espoused secularism) were the Syrian Communist Party, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) and the Arab Ba'ath Party; Assad joined the latter in 1946, and some of his friends belonged to the SSNP. The Ba'ath (<b>Renaissance)</b> <b>Party</b> espoused a pan-Arabist, socialist ideology.|$|E
500|$|The Persian {{alphabet}} {{was introduced}} into education and public life, although {{the banning of}} the Islamic <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party</b> in 1993 slowed down the adoption. In 1999, the word Fârsi {{was removed from the}} state-language law. [...] the de facto standard in use is a Cyrillic alphabet, and [...] only a very small part of the population can read the Persian alphabet.|$|E
50|$|After {{the death}} of Lunalilo the Royal Election of 1874 was held. Queen Emma and her party the Queen Emma Party ran against Kalākaua, but he won. Kalākaua was leader of the party. After winning the election, he put members of his party in {{appointed}} positions and they were a powerful bloc in the kingdom legislature.The party emphasized central authority, expanded foreign relations, and a nationalism that stimulated {{what became known as}} the First Hawaiian <b>Renaissance.</b> The <b>party</b> was usually associated with government workers.|$|R
25|$|The party {{headquarters}} building is named the Richard D. Obenshain Center {{in memory of}} Richard D. Obenshain (1936–1978), the State Party Chairman who beginning in 1972, helped lead the <b>party's</b> <b>renaissance</b> in Virginia following 95years of virtual control by the State's Democratic Party (since Reconstruction except when William Mahone and the Readjuster Party coalition dominated affairs for a few years).|$|R
2500|$|Both men {{had come}} to their own terms with the new baby boomer lifestyles. Kiesinger {{considered}} them to be [...] "a shameful crowd of long-haired drop-outs who needed a bath and someone to discipline them". On the other hand, Brandt needed {{a while to get}} into contact with, and to earn credibility among, the [...] "Ausserparlamentarische Opposition" [...] (APO) ("the extra-parliamentary opposition"). The students questioned West German society in general, seeking social, legal, and political reforms. Also, the unrest led to a <b>renaissance</b> of right-wing <b>parties</b> in some of the Bundeslands' (German states under the Bundesrepublik) Parliaments.|$|R
2500|$|The Islamic <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party</b> (IRP), is a banned Islamist {{political}} party and [...] {{designated as a}} terrorist organization since 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Sayid Abdulloh Nuri (Tajik: Сайид Абдуллоҳи Нурӣ, Perso-Arabic script: سید عبدالله نوری) (March 15, 1947 [...] August 9, 2006), also transliterated as Abdullah Nuri, led the Islamic <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party</b> of Tajikistan from 1993 {{until he}} {{died of cancer in}} late 2006. During the Tajik Civil War of 1992 to 1997 he led the United Tajik Opposition. Nuri and President of Tajikistan Emomali Rakhmonov ended the civil war by signing the Tajik National Peace Accord in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|For example, on April 20, 2012 the {{opposition}} Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Your Party and New <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party</b> submitted censure motions against ministers of Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda's cabinet. They censured Minister of Defense Naoki Tanaka and Minister of Land Takeshi Maeda, {{and refused to}} cooperate with the government on passing an increase to Japan's consumption tax from 5% to 10%. Noda had [...] "staked his political life" [...] on passing the consumption tax increase, so on June 4, 2012 Noda reshuffled his cabinet and replaced Tanaka and Maeda.|$|E
50|$|Catan's {{candidacy}} {{has been}} forwarded {{for the position}} of the deputy in the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova in the 25 February 2001 elections on the list of the <b>Renaissance</b> and Conciliation <b>Party</b> of Moldova, but this political party has not obtained enough electoral support to participate in the elections. Starting from 2002 Catan was teaching at the Property Law Faculty at the Technical University in Moldova, as a university professor. In the period 25 September 2009 - 14 January 2011, the General Victor Catan served in the position of Minister of Internal Affairs in the Government led by Mr. Vlad Filat. He is also member of the Liberal Democrat Party of the Republic of Moldova.|$|R
5000|$|The second task of {{the party}} is to work towards the <b>Renaissance,</b> which the <b>party</b> leader {{described}} as being a dynamic undertaking that would shatter {{what he described as}} the old regime. The Renaissance ideal, which Saadeh traces back to the ingenuity of the first Syrians - the Assyrians and the Phoenicians, among others, lies in the mastery of the Syrian people over the sciences and the crafts, which he eulogizes in The Genesis of Nations while attacking what he deemed as the antiquated notions of religious fatalism. In order to regain its mastery over the crafts and over its own destiny, Saadeh underlines the need for intellectualism, education, and the pursuit of knowledge as cornerstones of the future Syrian society, a notion he summarizes in his famous quote, [...] "Society is knowledge, and knowledge is power".|$|R
2500|$|There is some {{reported}} {{concern among}} mainstream Muslim leaders that minority religious groups undermine national unity. There {{is a concern}} for religious institutions becoming active in the political sphere. The Islamic <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party</b> (IRP), a major combatant in the 1992–1997 Civil War and then-proponent {{of the creation of}} an Islamic state in Tajikistan, constitutes no more than 30% of the government by statute. [...] Membership in Hizb ut-Tahrir, a party which today aims for a nonviolent overthrow of secular governments and the unification of Tajiks under one Islamic state, is illegal and members are subject to arrest and imprisonment. Numbers of large mosques appropriate for Friday prayers are limited and some feel this is discriminatory.|$|E
2500|$|Masuzoe ran as an {{independent}} with LDP support, as part of which he resigned from the New <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party</b> and entered into a policy pact with the LDP. His platform focused on successfully holding the 2020 Summer Olympics and enhancing social security and disaster prevention measures. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga of the LDP stated that Masuzoe [...] "made a great contribution as a state minister to the management of health, welfare and labor issues", while Jin Matsubara of the DPJ stated that Masuzoe was [...] "the right candidate to receive our support". Masuzoe attended {{a meeting of the}} Tokyo LDP in January 2014 and apologized for leaving the party in a bid to win their support.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2010, Masuzoe {{left the}} LDP {{and formed a}} {{splinter}} group called New <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party</b> (Shintō Kaikaku). The party's platform included a call for decentralization, deregulation, and a halving {{of the number of}} Diet members. At the time, The Economists Banyan column dubbed Masuzoe [...] "Japan's most popular politician." [...] Both the NRP and Your Party, led by ex-LDP lawmaker Yoshimi Watanabe, were viewed at the time as potentially effective center-right counterweights to the Democratic Party of Japan, and possibly even successors to the LDP itself. Masuzoe's party nonetheless gained minimal traction. Four of its initial six Upper House members were voted out in the July 2010 election, leaving the party with only Masuzoe and Hiroyuki Arai representing it in the Upper House; the NRP was ultimately overshadowed by Your Party as a reformist element.|$|E
2500|$|In Heldon proper, Feric dines in the [...] "Eagle's Nest" [...] tavern, and mulls {{over the}} {{question}} of how to change this situation. Should he enter politics or the military? Feric then witnesses the oratory of Seph Bogel, leader of the Human <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party,</b> who speaks eloquently but ineffectually to the crowd about the need for human purity. Fired by his words, Feric is inspired to take control of the listening crowd and leads a mob to the same border post, there to slay the Dominator (or [...] "Dom") who had quietly disguised himself as a clerk to sway the immigration decisions in favor of mutants. At Bogel's invitation, he assumes leadership of the Party, which Feric later renames The Sons of the Swastika, and the two travel on to Walder—the second city of Heldon—to meet the party inner circle and begin the great task.|$|E
2500|$|Nuri's funeral {{took place}} in Dushanbe, Tajikistan with {{thousands}} in attendance. IRP Deputy Chairman Muhiddin Kabiri called Nuri an [...] "irreplaceable personality. He led his own school [...] in Tajikistan and in the region, which consisted of creating peace, unity, and forgiveness and forgetting [...] The community of Tajikistan did not have this before -- the country had not experienced {{this sort of thing}} before. But it showed that Islam is a peace-loving and forgiving religion, and I hope that this is his legacy in Tajikistan." [...] Dodajon Ataullo, editor-in-chief of Charoghi Ruz newspaper, [...] "His death is very heavy on me, very painful for me. During his illness, I was always with him [...] I remember his face, his features, his soulful eyes. I recognize him not only as one of the biggest politicians, but [...] as one of the major personalities and most beloved figures in Tajikistan's history in the 20th century. That is how I view him." [...] Mahmadsaid Ubaidulloyev, Chairman of the Tajik Parliament, said, [...] "His personal qualities and political charisma raised his authority among the citizens of Tajikistan {{and the members of the}} Islamic <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party.</b> The president of the republic highly values [...] role, his activities, and appreciates and calls attention to his deeds. Today we say goodbye to a famous politician, and we respect his role in establishing peace and unity in Tajikistan. We remember his great and historic part and his spiritual deeds." ...|$|E
50|$|The Islamic <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Party</b> of Tajikistan {{has been}} {{banned by the}} Tajik {{government}} and was labeled as a terrorist organization.
