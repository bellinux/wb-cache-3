5000|$|Detection {{of virus}} encoded DNA and RNA {{is done with}} {{polymerase}} chain reaction. Nucleic acid hybridization with virus-specific probes detects specific viruses. Molecular techniques are usually used to confirm positive serological results due to their higher sensitivity and specificity. Variations of PCR such as nested <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> <b>PCR</b> and real time PCR {{can also be used}} to determine viral loads in patient serum. This is often used to monitor treatment success in HIV cases.|$|E
5000|$|PCR is {{frequently}} used to for rapid identification of specific DNA viruses from the CSF, while <b>Reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> <b>PCR</b> {{is commonly used}} to identify RNA viruses in the CSF. [...] The accuracy of this diagnostic tool {{is limited by the}} amount of the virus present in the CSF. Viral replication tends to peak early and then decline to undetectable levels in CNS infection. Within the first 5 days of symptom onset, before the decline of viral replication, PCR assays have a higher incidence of detecting CNS infection.|$|E
5000|$|While {{methods for}} each type of probing differ in steps, the probing of {{secondary}} structure involves certain steps {{in order to determine the}} structure. The first step involved is submitting the structural RNA to the probe of interest and incubating over a certain amount of time to allow the reaction to occur. The RNA is then transcribed using <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> <b>PCR,</b> where this results in different lengths of bands due to the modification of the RNA at specific sites, which causes the reverse transcriptase to fall off. [...] These bands are then run on a gel with sequencing data determined from RNA sequencing.|$|E

40|$|The {{promoter}} {{region of}} the �-subunit of the calcium/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (�-CaMKII) gene was inserted into a �-galactosidase (�-gal) reporter plasmid, and �-gal activities were examined in neuroblastoma (NB 2 a) and pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells after transient or stable transfections. The �-CaMKII promoter was 12 - to 45 -fold more active in NB 2 a compared with PC 12 cells after transient or stable transfections. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) stimulated reporter gene expression at both protein and mRNA levels in transfected PC 12 cells. RA increased the level of endogenous �-CaMKII mRNA in untransfected PC 12 cells by 4. 4 -fold. The transcription initiation site(s) (TIS) of the �-CaMKII gene in PC 12 cells and rat brain was examined by RNase protection assays (RPA) and <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> <b>PCRs.</b> The TIS for the �-CaMKII/�-gal reporter gene in transfected PC 12 cells wa...|$|R
5000|$|Zika virus can be {{identified}} by <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> <b>PCR</b> (RT-PCR) in acutely ill patients. However, the period of viremia can be short and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends RT-PCR testing be done on serum collected within 1 to 3 days of symptom onset or on saliva samples collected during the first 3 to 5 days. When evaluating paired samples, Zika virus was detected more frequently in saliva than serum. [...] Urine samples can be collected and tested up to 14 days after the onset of symptoms, as the virus has been seen to survive longer in the urine than either saliva or serum. The longest period of detectable virus has been 11 days and Zika virus {{does not appear to}} establish latency.|$|E
40|$|To further {{explore the}} {{controversial}} potential for extrahepatic replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV), the highly strand-specific rTth method of <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> <b>PCR</b> {{was used to}} examine sera, liver, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other extrahepatic tissues from HCV-infected chimpanzees and humans. Positive-strand HCV RNA was present in the liver at approximately 10 -fold-higher levels than negative-strand HCV RNA. No negative-strand RNA was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or other extrahepatic tissues despite the presence of abundant positive-strand RNA.

40|$|The San Miguel {{sea lion}} viruses (SMSV) and {{vesicular}} exanthema of swine viruses (VESV) are related morphologically and antigenically, but {{little has been}} done to determine their genotypic relationship {{to each other and to}} other caliciviruses. To examine this relationship, <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> <b>PCRs</b> were performed by using oligonucleotide primer sets designed to amplify portions of the 2 C RNA helicase-like and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase regions with total cellular RNA purified from virus-infected cell cultures as a template. The 2 C RNA helicase primers directed the amplification of this region from eight SMSV serotypes, five VESV serotypes, and four related viruses. The RNA polymerase primer sets amplified products from all these viruses except one. Phylogenetic comparison of the caliciviruses demonstrated that SMSV, VESV, and four related viruses are closely related while being distinct from feline calicivirus, the human caliciviruses (small, round-structured viruses), and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and that they should be classified as a single genotype within the Caliciviridae...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to study the {{molecular}} basis of the determination processes of the mammalian germ cell lineage, {{we have tried to}} isolate a mouse gene homolog to vasa, which plays an essential role as a maternal determining factor for the formation of Drosophila germ cell precursors. By <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> <b>PCRs</b> of mouse primordial germ cell cDNAs using family-specific primers, we obtained a gene (Mvh) encoding a DEAD-family protein that showed a much higher degree of similarity with the product of the Drosophila vasa gene (vas) than previously reported mouse genes. In adult tissues, Mvh transcripts were exclusively detected in testicular germ cells, in which Mvh protein was found to be localized in cytoplasm of spermatocytes and round spermatids including a perinuclear granule. The protein was also expressed in germ cells colonized in embryonic gonads but was not detected in pluripotential embryonic cells such as stem cells and germ cells. These results suggest the possibility that the Mvh protein may {{play an important role in}} the determination events of mouse germ cells as in the case of Drosophila vasa...|$|R
40|$|The {{lipoxygenase}} (LO) pathway of arachidonate metabolism {{has been}} suggested to {{play a key role}} in atherosclerosis and in mediating several actions of angiotensin II (AII). However, the relationship between LO activation and factors linked to accelerated diabetic vascular disease such as hyperglycemia and AII is not known. We have investigated the effect of high glucose (HG; 25 mM) and AII on LO activity as well as LO protein and mRNA expression in porcine aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (PVSMCs). We observed that cells cultured in HG had significantly higher levels of the cell-associated LO products 12 - and 15 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). AII added to cells grown in HG specifically further increased only cell-associated 12 -HETE levels. Using immunoblot analysis and <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> <b>PCRs,</b> we demonstrated the presence in PVSMCs of porcine leukocyte-type 12 -LO protein and mRNA, respectively. Furthermore, the levels of both were markedly upregulated by AII as well as by HG. These studies suggest that enhanced 12 -LO activity and expression are mechanisms for accelerated vascular disease produced by HG and AII in diabetes mellitus...|$|R

40|$|Following an {{approach}} used to specifically identify polioviruses and enterovirus 71, {{we have developed}} <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> (RT) <b>PCR</b> primers containing mixed-base residues or deoxyinosine at positions of codon degeneracy. These primers permit specific RT-PCR amplification of echovirus 30 (E 30) sequences by targeting sites that encode conserved amino acid motifs within the major capsid protein, VP 1. All 221 E 30 strains tested, isolated in 16 countries over a 44 -year period, yielded the predicted 158 -bp PCR product. No specific products were obtained by PCR assays containing templates {{from any of the}} other 63 EV serotypes.

40|$|Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are a {{class of}} highly conserved small non-coding RNAs that play an {{important}} part in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. A substantial number of miRNAs have been proposed as biomarkers for diseases. While <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> Real-time <b>PCR</b> (RT-qPCR) is considered the gold standard for the evaluation and validation of miRNA biomarkers, small RNA sequencing is now routinely being adopted for the identification of dysregulated miRNAs.

40|$|The {{effect of}} UV {{exposure}} on Toxoplasma gondii oocysts {{has not been}} completely defined for use in water disinfection. This study evaluated UV-irradiated oocysts by three assays: a SCID mouse bioassay, an in vitro T. gondii oocyst plaque (TOP) assay, and a quantitative <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> real-time <b>PCR</b> (RT-qPCR) assay. The results from the animal bioassay show that 1 - and 3 -log 10 inactivation is achieved with 4 mJ/cm 2 UV and 10 mJ/cm 2 low-pressure UV, respectively. TOP assay results, but not RT-qPCR results, correlate well with bioassay results. In conclusion, a 3 -log 10 inactivation of T. gondii oocysts is achieved by 10 -mJ/cm 2 low-pressure UV, and the in vitro TOP assay is a promising alternative to the mouse bioassay...|$|R
25|$|Studies of {{individual}} transcripts were being performed several decades before any transcriptomics approaches were available. Libraries of silkmoth mRNAs were collected and converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) for storage using <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> {{in the late}} 1970s. In the 1980s, low-throughput Sanger sequencing began {{to be used to}} sequence random individual transcripts from these libraries, called Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). The Sanger method of sequencing was predominant until the advent of high-throughput methods such as sequencing by synthesis (Solexa/Illumina). ESTs came to prominence during the 1990s as an efficient method to determine the gene content of an organism without sequencing the entire genome. Quantification {{of individual}} transcripts by Northern blotting, nylon membrane arrays, and later <b>Reverse</b> <b>Transcriptase</b> quantitative <b>PCR</b> (RT-qPCR) were also popular, but these methods are laborious and can only capture a tiny subsection of a transcriptome. Consequently, the manner in which a transcriptome as a whole is expressed and regulated remained unknown until higher-throughput techniques were developed.|$|R

40|$|High-throughput {{sequencing}} furnishes a {{large number}} of short sequence reads from uncloned DNA and has rapidly become a major tool for identifying viruses in biological samples, and in particular when the target sequence is undefined. In this study, we assessed the analytical sensitivity of a pipeline for detection of viruses in biological samples based on either the Roche- 454 genome sequencer or Illumina genome analyzer platforms. We sequenced biological samples artificially spiked {{with a wide range of}} viruses with genomes composed of single or double-stranded DNA or RNA, including linear or circular single-stranded DNA. Viruses were added at a very low concentration most often corresponding to 3 or 0. 8 times the validated level of detection of quantitative <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> <b>PCRs</b> (RT-PCRs). For the viruses represented, or resembling those represented, in public nucleotide sequence databases, we show that the higher output of Illumina is associated with a much greater sensitivity, approaching that of optimized quantitative (RT-) PCRs. In this blind study, identification of viruses was achieved without incorrect identification. Nevertheless, at these low concentrations, the number of reads generated by the Illumina platform was too small to facilitate assembly of contigs without the use of a reference sequence, thus precluding detection of unknown viruses. When the virus load was sufficiently high, de novo assembly permitted the generation of long contigs corresponding to nearly full-length genomes and thus should facilitate the identification of novel viruses...|$|R
40|$|Tetraspanins (Tsps) are {{membrane}} {{proteins that}} are widely expressed in eukaryotic organisms. Only recently, Tsps {{have started to}} acquire relevance as potential new drug targets as they contribute, via protein-protein interactions, to numerous pathophysiological processes including infectious diseases and cancer. However, due to {{a high number of}} isoforms and functional redundancy, knowledge on specific functions of most Tsps is still scarce. We set out to characterize five previously annotated Tsps, TspA-E, from Dictyostelium discoideum, a model for studying proteins that have human orthologues. Using <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> <b>PCRs,</b> we found mRNAs for TspA-E in the multicellular slug stage, whereas vegetative cells expressed only TspA, TspC and, to a lesser extent, TspD. We raised antibodies against TspA, TspC and TspD and detected endogenous TspA, as well as heterologously expressed TspA and TspC by Western blot. N-deglycosylation assays and mutational analyses showed glycosylation of TspA and TspC in vivo. GFP-tagged Tsps co-localized with the proton pump on the contractile vacuole network. Deletion strains of TspC and TspD exibited unaltered growth, adhesion, random motility and development. Yet, tspC- cells showed a defect in coping with hypo-osmotic stress, due to accumulation of contractile vacuoles, but heterologous expression of TspC rescued their phenotype. In conclusion, our data fill a gap in Dictyostelium research and open up the possibility that Tsps in contractile vacuoles of e. g. Trypanosoma may one day constitute a valuable drug target for treating sleeping sickness, one of the most threatening tropical diseases...|$|R
40|$|Streptomyces coelicolor is the {{prototype}} {{for the investigation}} of antibiotic-producing and differentiating actinomycetes. As soil bacteria, streptomycetes can metabolize {{a wide variety of}} carbon sources and are hence vested with various specific permeases. Their activity and regulation substantially determine the nutritional state of the cell and, therefore, influence morphogenesis and antibiotic production. We have surveyed the genome of S. coelicolor A 3 (2) to provide a thorough description of the carbohydrate uptake systems. Among 81 ATP-binding cassette (ABC) permeases that are present in the genome, we found 45 to encode a putative solute binding protein, an essential feature for carbohydrate permease function. Similarity analysis allowed the prediction of putative ABC systems for transport of cellobiose and cellotriose, α-glucosides, lactose, maltose, maltodextrins, ribose, sugar alcohols, xylose, and β-xylosides. A novel putative bifunctional protein composed of a substrate binding and a membrane-spanning moiety is likely to account for ribose or ribonucleoside uptake. Glucose may be incorporated by a proton-driven symporter of the major facilitator superfamily while a putative sodium-dependent permease of the solute-sodium symporter family may mediate uptake of galactose and a facilitator protein of the major intrinsic protein family may internalize glycerol. Of the predicted gene clusters, <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> <b>PCRs</b> showed active gene expression in 8 of 11 systems. Together with the previously surveyed permeases of the phosphotransferase system that accounts for the uptake of fructose and N-acetylglucosamine, the genome of S. coelicolor encodes at least 53 potential carbohydrate uptake systems...|$|R
