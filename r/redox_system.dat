Significant differences are observed in the electron transfer kinetics of the buckypaper-modified electrodes for both the outer- and inner-sphere <b>redox</b> <b>systems.</b> These differences can be ascribed {{to the nature of}} the carbon nanotubes (nanotube diameter, chirality and aspect ratio), surface oxidation degree and type of functionalities. In the case of dopamine, ferrocene/ferrocenium, and quinone/hydroquinone <b>redox</b> <b>systems</b> the voltammetric response should be thought as a complex contribution of different tips and sidewall domains which act as mediators for the electron transfer between the adsorbate species and the molecules in solution.

5000|$|The {{second step}} {{requires}} {{the entrance of}} ferric ions into the newly formed vesicles from the external environment. Even when cultured in a Fe3+ deficient medium, MTB succeed at accumulating high intracellular concentrations of this ion. It {{has been suggested that}} they accomplish this by secreting, upon need, a siderophore, a low-molecular-weight ligand displaying an elevated affinity for Fe3+ ions. The [...] "Fe3+-siderophore" [...] complex is subsequently moved in the cytoplasm, where it is cleaved. The ferric ions must then be converted into the ferrous form (Fe2+), to be accumulated within the BMP; this is achieved by means of a transmembrane transporter, which exhibits sequence homology with a Na+/H+ antiporter. Furthermore, the complex is a H+/Fe2+ antiporter, which transports ions via the proton gradient. These transmembrane transporters are localised both in the cytoplasmic membrane and in the MM, but in an inverted orientation; this configuration allows them to generate an efflux of Fe2+ ions at the cytoplasmic membrane, and an influx of this same ion at the MM. This step is strictly controlled by a cytochrome-dependent <b>redox</b> <b>system,</b> which is not yet fully explained and appears to be species-specific.|$|E
50|$|Structural {{continuity}} between extracellular, cyst skeletal and nuclear components was discussed by Hay, Berezny et al. and Oschman. Historically, these elements have {{been referred to}} as ground substances, and because of their continuity, they act to form a complex, interlaced system that reaches into and contacts every part of the body. Even as early as 1851 it was recognized that the nerve and blood systems do not directly connect to the cell, but are mediated by and through an extracellular matrix. Recent research regarding the electrical charges of the various glycol-protein components of the extracellular matrix shows that because of the high density of negative charges on glycosaminoglycans (provided by sulfate and carboxylate groups of the uronic acid residues) the matrix is an extensive <b>redox</b> <b>system</b> capable of absorbing and donating electrons at any point. This electron transfer function reaches into the interiors of cells as the cytoplasmic matrix is also strongly negatively charged. The entire extracellular and cellular matrix functions as a biophysical storage system or accumulator for electrical charge. From thermodynamic, energetic and geometrical considerations, molecules of the ground substance are considered to form minimal physical and electrical surfaces, such that, based on the mathematics of minimal surfaces, minuscule changes can lead to significant changes in distant areas of the ground substance. This discovery is seen as having implications for many physiological and biochemical processes, including membrane transport, antigen-antibody interactions, protein synthesis, oxidation reactions, actin-myosin interactions, sol to gel transformations in polysaccharides.|$|E

Gold metal is deposited simultaneously on two adjacent disc electrodes (100 mu m diameter, approximately 125 mu m separation) until short-circuit conditions trigger the end {{point of the}} electro-deposition. Symmetric gold junctions with typically 5 mu m average inter-electrode gap size, 140 mu m gap length, and approximately 18 mu m junction depth are obtained.

We hypothesize that hypoxic and inflammatory events induce oxidative stress in the periodontal ligament (PDL) by activating NOX 4. Human primary PDL fibroblasts were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis (LPS-PG), a periodontal pathogen bacterium under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. By quantitative PCR, immunoblot, immunostaining, and a specific ROS assay we determined the amount of NOX 4, ROS, and several <b>redox</b> <b>systems.</b> Healthy and inflamed periodontal tissues were collected to evaluate NOX 4 and <b>redox</b> <b>systems</b> by immunohistochemistry. We found significantly increased NOX 4 levels after hypoxic or inflammatory stimulation in PDL cells (P< 0. 001) which was even more pronounced after combination of the stimuli. This was accompanied by a significant upregulation of ROS and catalase (P< 0. 001). However, prolonged incubation with both stimuli induced a reduction of catalase indicating a collapse of the protective machinery favoring ROS increase and the progression of inflammatory oral diseases.

In the following study we compared the effects of such diets on redox regulation pathways during development of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) larvae. Cod larvae were fed a control diet of copepods or the typical rotifer/Artemia diet commonly used in commercial marine fish hatcheries, from first feeding until after metamorphosis. The oxidised and reduced glutathione levels, the redox potential, and the mRNA expression of 100 genes in <b>redox</b> <b>system</b> pathways were then compared between treatments during larval development. We found that rotifer/Artemia-fed cod larvae had lower levels of oxidised glutathione, a more reduced redox potential, and altered expression of {{approximately half of the}} <b>redox</b> <b>system</b> genes when compared to copepod-fed larvae.
