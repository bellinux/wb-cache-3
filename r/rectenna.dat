25|$|Power {{transmission}} via {{radio waves}} {{can be made}} more directional, allowing longer-distance power beaming, with shorter wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, typically in the microwave range. A <b>rectenna</b> {{may be used to}} convert the microwave energy back into electricity. <b>Rectenna</b> conversion efficiencies exceeding 95% have been realized. Power beaming using microwaves has been proposed for the transmission of energy from orbiting solar power satellites to Earth and the beaming of power to spacecraft leaving orbit has been considered.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{microwave}} {{transmission of}} {{power has been}} the most controversial issue in considering any SPS design. At the Earth's surface, a suggested microwave beam would have a maximum intensity at its center, of 23mW/cm2 (less than 1/4 the solar irradiation constant), and an intensity of less than 1mW/cm2 outside the <b>rectenna</b> fenceline (the receiver's perimeter). These compare with current United States Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) workplace exposure limits for microwaves, which are 10mW/cm2, - the limit itself being expressed in voluntary terms and ruled unenforceable for Federal OSHA enforcement purposes. A beam of this intensity is therefore at its center, of a similar magnitude to current safe workplace levels, even for long term or indefinite exposure. Outside the receiver, it is far less than the OSHA long-term levels Over 95% of the beam energy will fall on the <b>rectenna.</b> The remaining microwave energy will be absorbed and dispersed well within standards currently imposed upon microwave emissions around the world. It is important for system efficiency that as much of the microwave radiation as possible be focused on the <b>rectenna.</b> Outside the <b>rectenna,</b> microwave intensities rapidly decrease, so nearby towns or other human activity should be completely unaffected.|$|E
25|$|Special antennas {{can collect}} energy from stray radio waves, this {{can also be}} done with a <b>Rectenna</b> and {{theoretically}} at even higher frequency EM radiation with a Nantenna.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} power {{transmission}} from the solar power satellite and of {{radiation from the}} ground based <b>rectennas</b> on radio astronomy, radar astronomy, and optical astronomy are discussed. Interference sources, acceptable signal and noise levels, and conflicting site requirements for observatories and <b>rectennas</b> are considered...|$|R
50|$|As {{previously}} stated, one of {{the major}} limitations of optical <b>rectennas</b> is the frequency at which they operate. The high frequency of light in the ideal range of wavelengths makes the use of typical Schottky diodes impractical. Although MIM diodes show promising features for use in optical <b>rectennas,</b> more advances are necessary to operate efficiently at higher frequencies.|$|R
50|$|Researchers {{are experimenting}} {{with the use of}} <b>rectennas</b> to power sensors in remote areas.|$|R
25|$|The Earth-based <b>rectenna</b> {{would likely}} consist of many short dipole antennas {{connected}} via diodes. Microwave broadcasts from the satellite would be {{received in the}} dipoles with about 85% efficiency. With a conventional microwave antenna, the reception efficiency is better, but its cost and complexity are also considerably greater. Rectennas would likely be several kilometers across.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{material}} launched need not be delivered to its eventual orbit immediately, which {{raises the possibility that}} high efficiency (but slower) engines could move SPS material from LEO to GEO at an acceptable cost. Examples include ion thrusters or nuclear propulsion. Power beaming from geostationary orbit by microwaves carries the difficulty that the required 'optical aperture' sizes are very large. For example, the 1978 NASA SPS study required a 1-km diameter transmitting antenna, and a 10km diameter receiving <b>rectenna,</b> for a microwave beam at 2.45GHz. These sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths, although they have increased atmospheric absorption and even potential beam blockage by rain or water droplets. Because of the thinned array curse, {{it is not possible to}} make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites. The large size of the transmitting and receiving antennas means that the minimum practical power level for an SPS will necessarily be high; small SPS systems will be possible, but uneconomic.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the cost}} of {{implementing}} such a system, SBSP also introduces several technological hurdles, including the problem of transmitting energy from orbit to Earth's surface for use. Since wires extending from Earth's surface to an orbiting satellite are neither practical nor feasible with current technology, SBSP designs generally {{include the use of}} some manner of wireless power transmission and its concomitant conversion inefficiencies, as well as land use concerns for the necessary antenna stations to receive the energy at Earth's surface. The collecting satellite would convert solar energy into electrical energy on board, powering a microwave transmitter or laser emitter, and transmit this energy to a collector (or microwave <b>rectenna)</b> on Earth's surface. Contrary to appearances of SBSP in popular novels and video games, most designs propose beam energy densities that are not harmful if human beings were to be inadvertently exposed, such as if a transmitting satellite's beam were to wander off-course. But the vast size of the receiving antennas that would be necessary would still require large blocks of land near the end users to be procured and dedicated to this purpose. The service life of space-based collectors in the face of challenges from long-term exposure to the space environment, including degradation from radiation and micrometeoroid damage could also become a concern for SBSP.|$|E
50|$|RF <b>rectennas</b> {{are used}} for several forms of {{wireless}} energy transfer. In the microwave range, experimental devices already reached a power conversion efficiency of 85-90%.|$|R
50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} is {{that current}} optical <b>rectennas</b> are produced using electron beam (e-beam) lithography. This process {{is slow and}} relatively expensive because parallel processing is not possible with e-beam lithography. Typically, e-beam lithography is used only for research purposes when extremely fine resolutions are needed for minimum feature size (typically, {{on the order of}} nanometers). However, photolithographic techniques have advanced to where it is possible to have minimum feature sizes on the order of tens of nanometers, making it possible to produce <b>rectennas</b> by means of photolithography.|$|R
40|$|Proposed integrated-circuit modules called "nanoconverters" would derive DC {{power from}} {{impinging}} electromagnetic beams having frequencies in the terahertz range. Nanoconverters {{are composed of}} microscopic antennas and diodes resembling <b>rectennas</b> {{that have been developed}} to perform the same function at frequencies in the gigahertz range. The submillimeter wavelength nanoconverters would make it possible to incorporate the antenna elements and diodes on structures much smaller than those of prior <b>rectennas,</b> thereby opening up opportunities for noncontact transmission of power to a variety of microelectronic devices, including surgically implanted medical devices and untethered microscopic robots...|$|R
2500|$|The {{development}} of microwave technology during World War 2, {{such as the}} klystron and magnetron tubes and parabolic antennas [...] made radiative (far-field) methods practical for the first time, and the first long-distance wireless power transmission was achieved in the 1960s by William C. Brown. [...] In 1964 Brown invented the <b>rectenna</b> which could efficiently convert microwaves to DC power, and in 1964 demonstrated it with the first wireless-powered aircraft, a model helicopter powered by microwaves beamed from the ground. [...] A major motivation for microwave research in the 1970s and 80s {{was to develop a}} solar power satellite. [...] Conceived in 1968 by Peter Glaser, this would harvest energy from sunlight using solar cells and beam it down to Earth as microwaves to huge rectennas, which would convert it to electrical energy on the electric power grid. In landmark 1975 experiments as technical director of a JPL/Raytheon program, Brown demonstrated long-range transmission by beaming 475 W of microwave power to a <b>rectenna</b> a mile away, with a microwave to DC conversion efficiency of 54%. At NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory he and Robert Dickinson transmitted 30kW DC output power across 1.5km with 2.38GHz microwaves from a 26 m dish to a 7.3 x 3.5 m <b>rectenna</b> array. The incident-RF to DC conversion efficiency of the <b>rectenna</b> was 80%. In 1983 Japan launched MINIX (Microwave Ionosphere Nonlinear Interaction Experiment), [...] a rocket experiment to test transmission of high power microwaves through the ionosphere.|$|E
2500|$|A {{commonly}} proposed {{approach to}} ensuring fail-safe beam targeting {{is to use}} a retrodirective phased array antenna/rectenna. A [...] "pilot" [...] microwave beam emitted {{from the center of the}} <b>rectenna</b> on the ground establishes a phase front at the transmitting antenna. There, circuits in each of the antenna's subarrays compare the pilot beam's phase front with an internal clock phase to control the phase of the outgoing signal. This forces the transmitted beam to be centered precisely on the <b>rectenna</b> and to have a high degree of phase uniformity; if the pilot beam is lost for any reason (if the transmitting antenna is turned away from the <b>rectenna,</b> for example) the phase control value fails and the microwave power beam is automatically defocused. Such a system would be physically incapable of focusing its power beam anywhere that did not have a pilot beam transmitter. The long-term effects of beaming power through the ionosphere in the form of microwaves has yet to be studied, but nothing has been suggested which might lead to any significant effect.|$|E
2500|$|Transmission: The most typical {{design for}} energy {{transmission}} is via an RF antenna at below 10GHz to a <b>rectenna</b> on the ground.

In order for there to be an efficient energy conversion, the temperature difference between the two bodies must be significant. R. L. Bailey claims that <b>rectennas</b> are not limited by Carnot efficiency, whereas photovoltaics are. However, he does not provide any argument for this claim. Furthermore, when the same assumptions used to obtain the 85% theoretical efficiency for <b>rectennas</b> are applied to single junction solar cells, the theoretical efficiency of single junction solar cells is also greater than 85%.|$|R

2500|$|Nanophotonic {{circuit designs}} {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to microwave and radio circuits, minimized {{by a factor of}} 100,000 or more. Researchers have made nano-optical antennas which emulate the design and functionality of radio antennas. There are a number of important differences between nanophotonics and scaled down microwave circuits. At optical frequency, metals behave much less like ideal conductors, and also exhibit plasmon-related effects like kinetic inductance and surface plasmon resonance. A nantenna is a nanoscopic rectifying antenna, a technology being developed to convert light into electric power. The concept is based on the <b>rectenna</b> which is used in wireless power transmission. A <b>rectenna</b> functions like a specialized radio antenna which is used to convert radio waves into direct current electricity.

In 1973 Peter Glaser was granted U.S. patent number 3,781,647 for his method of transmitting power over long distances (e.g. from an SPS to Earth's surface) using microwaves from a very large antenna (up to one square kilometer) on the satellite to a much larger one, now known as a <b>rectenna,</b> on the ground.|$|E

5000|$|The theory behind optical <b>rectennas</b> is {{essentially}} the same as for traditional (radio or microwave) <b>rectennas.</b> Incident light on the antenna causes electrons in the antenna to move back and forth at the same frequency as the incoming light. This is caused by the oscillating electric field of the incoming electromagnetic wave. The movement of electrons is an alternating current (AC) in the antenna circuit. To convert this into direct current (DC), the AC must be rectified, which is typically done with a diode. The resulting DC current can then be used to power an external load.The resonant frequency of antennas (frequency which results in lowest impedance and thus highest efficiency) scales linearly with the physical dimensions of the antenna according to simple microwave antenna theory. [...] The wavelengths in the solar spectrum range from approximately 0.3-2.0 μm.

Gold nanoarrays were built to absorb light by plasmonic resonance by depositing a gold layer on CdSe tetrapods or directly growing nanowires via template synthesis; various alkanethiolates were explored as rectifying units. The tunneling properties of alkanethiolates on gold nanoarrays were examined by electrochemical analysis. Preliminary photocurrent tests show that electric currents can be induced at different optical frequencies depending on the aspect ratios of the nanoarrays. However, gold contributes as an enhancement rather than an active material. Furthermore, by fitting the impedance spectroscopy data with equivalent electric circuits, the calculated tunneling barrier of the self-assembled monolayer on gold nanoarrays is ten times lower than on gold film, suggesting that the monolayer formed on gold nanoarrays is defective and cannot serve as a practical rectifying barrier. This concept will need further investigation to lead to an applicable photovoltaic cell...|$|R
