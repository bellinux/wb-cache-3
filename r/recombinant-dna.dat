Neither mosaicism nor a structurally aberrant Y chromosome was observed when routine cytogenetic {{analysis was performed}} on both lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts. Y chromosome-specific single-copy and repeated DNA sequences were detected in the patient's genome by means of 11 different <b>recombinant-DNA</b> probes of known regional assignment on the human Y chromosome. Data indicated that the short arm, the centromere, {{and part of the}} long-arm euchromatin of the Y chromo-some have been retained and that the patient lacks deletion intervals 6 and 7 of Yq. High-resolution analysis of prometaphase chromosomes revealed additional euchromatic material on the short arm of one of the patient's chromosomes 15.

It left a legacy that remains influential decades later when the world is {{faced with the prospect}} of a cornucopia of new products derived from gene-splicing tech-nology. Unlike the initial concerns over the risks of <b>recombinant-DNA</b> molecule technol-ogy (r-DNA), which was the centrepiece of the early controversy during and for several years after the 1975 Asilomar meeting, the contested issues today are about the social, environmental, economic, and ethical consequences of creating products from the pro-genitor technology. The public’s attention has turned from the risks of r-DNA in basic research to the risks of biotechnology primarily in agriculture and the pharmaceutical industry. In this paper, I focus on the cultural, political and epistemological components of risk analysis for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their impact on the regulation of the biotechnology industry.

40|$|To isolate DNA {{sequences}} {{unique to}} chromosome 21 {{we have used}} a <b>recombinant-DNA</b> library, constructed from a mouse-human somatic-cell hybrid line containing chromosome 21 as the only human chromosome. Individual recombinant phage containing human DNA inserts were identified by their hybridization to total human DNA sequences and by their failure to hybridize to total mouse DNA sequences. A repeat-free human DNA fragment was then subcloned from each of 14 such recombinant phage. An independent somatic-cell hybrid was used to assign all 14 subcloned fragments to chromosome 21. Thirteen of the fragments have been regionally mapped using a somatic-cell hybrid containing a human 21 translocation chromosome. Two probes map proximal to the 21 q 21. 2 translocation breakpoint, and 11 probes map distal to this breakpoint, placing them in the region 21 q 21. 2 - 21 q 22. One of seven probes used to screen for restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms recognized polymorphic DNA fragments when hybridized to genomic DNA from unrelated individuals. These 14 unique probes provide useful tools for studying the structure and function of human chromosome 21 as well as for investigating the molecular biology of Down syndrome...|$|E
30|$|In this report, we {{aimed at}} {{identifying}} which correlation of the differentially expressed miRNAs {{is more likely}} to play roles in transgenic maize through miRNA-gene interaction networks compared to non-transgenic near-isogenic control. Unless the GM plant is intended to produce new dsRNA molecules, the RNA itself is rarely formally considered in a risk assessment [14]. This is surprising since many GMO risk assessment guidance draw special attention to the characterization of novel RNAs, frequently mentioning the need to provide information on any expressed substances in the <b>recombinant-DNA</b> plant, such as: “any gene product(s) (e.g. a protein or an untranslated RNA)” (paragraph 32 of [34]); “demonstrate whether the inserted/modified sequence results in intended changes at the protein, RNA and/or metabolite levels” (page 10 of [35]); “detailed description of the expression of the gene product inserted in the host organism” (item 10, Annex II [36]). Although the GM varieties studied here were not tested for their dsRNA content during approval process because of assumptions made either explicitly or implicitly in the context of risk assessments, our detailed analysis of MON 89034, NK 603 and stacked MON 89034 xNK 603 suggests that their miRNA profiles are not equivalent to the near-isogenic non-transgenic control samples.|$|E
40|$|<b>Recombinant-DNA</b> (deoxyribonucleic acid) (r-DNA) proteins, {{produced}} {{in large quantities}} for human consumption, are now available in sufficient amounts for crystal growth. Crystallographic analysis is the only method now available for defining the atomic arrangements within complex biological molecules and decoding, e. g., {{the structure of the}} active site. Growing protein crystals in microgravity has become an important aspect of biology in space, since crystals that are large enough and of sufficient quality to permit complete structure determinations are usually obtained. However even small amounts of impurities in a protein preparation are anathema for the growth of a regular crystal lattice. A multicompartment electrolyzer with isoelectric, immobiline membranes, able to purify large quantities of r-DNA proteins is described. The electrolyzer consists of a stack of flow cells, delimited by membranes of very precise isoelectric point (pI, consisting of polyacrylamide supported by glass fiber filters containing Immobiline buffers and titrants to uniquely define a pI value) and very high buffering power, able to titrate all proteins tangent or crossing such membranes.

The MFD- 1 cell line was isolated from a 55 -year-old male with OAC without <b>recombinant-DNA</b> transformation. Somatic genetic variations from MFD- 1, tumour, normal oesophagus, and leucocytes were analysed with SNP 6. WGS was performed in tumour and leucocytes. RNAseq was performed in MFD- 1, and two classic OAC cell lines FLO 1 and OE 33. Transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) was performed in MFD- 1, OE 33, and non-neoplastic HET 1 A cells. Functional studies were performed. MFD- 1 had a high SNP genotype concordance with matched germline/tumour. Parental tumour and MFD- 1 carried four somatically acquired mutations in three recurrent mutated genes in OAC: TP 53, ABCB 1 and SEMA 5 A, not present in FLO- 1 or OE 33. MFD- 1 displayed high expression of epithelial and glandular markers and a unique fingerprint of open chromatin. MFD- 1 was tumorigenic in SCID mouse and proliferative and invasive in 3 D cultures.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the widespread acceptance of red blood cell grouping, blood serum protein and enzyme analysis, and HLA typing, the evidentiary status of forensic applications of <b>recombinant-DNA</b> technology is in flux. A proper evidentiary analysis must attend {{to the fact that}} there is no single method of DNA typing. As with the more established genetic tests, the probative value of the laboratory findings depends both on the procedure employed and the genetic characteristics that are discerned. This paper describes some of these procedures and the theory that lies behind them, and then considers the developing case law. Given the ongoing debate over the standards and controls that should be used in DNA typing, perhaps the findings of laboratories that have yet to establish a track record on independently administered, blind proficiency tests should be inadmissible, while proof that a laboratory has participated successfully in blind proficiency tests and has applied a similar or more rigorous protocol to the samples at bar should satisfy the threshold test for admissibility. In addition, the performance of the laboratory on the proficiency tests should accompany the results provided to the judge or jury. In this way, the trier of fact will be better positioned to assess the ability of the laboratory, using whatever type of DNA analysis and quality controls it has adopted, to obtain and interpret DNA profiles correctly...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInfluenza virus infections cause yearly {{epidemics}} {{and are a}} {{major cause}} of lower respiratory tract illnesses in humans worldwide. Influenza virus has long been recognized to be associated with higher morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Vaccination is an effective tool to prevent influenza virus infection in this group of patients. Vaccines employing <b>recombinant-DNA</b> technologies are an alternative to inactivated virus and live attenuated virus vaccines. Internal highly conserved viral nucleoprotein (NP) can be delivered as a DNA vaccine to provide heterosubtypic immunity, offering resistance against various influenza virus strains. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of an NP DNA vaccine for induction of cell-mediated immune responses and protection against influenza virus infection in a mouse model of diabetes. Healthy and diabetic BALB/c mice were immunized on days 0, 14, and 28 by injection of NP DNA vaccine. Two weeks after the last immunization, the cellular immune response was evaluated by gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), lymphocyte proliferation, and cytotoxicity assays. The mice were challenged with influenza virus, and the viral titers in the lungs were measured on day 4. Diabetic mice showed significantly smaller amounts of IFN-gamma production, lymphocyte proliferation, and cytotoxicity responses than nondiabetic mice. Furthermore, higher titers of the influenza virus were detected after challenge in the lungs of the diabetic mice. The present data suggest that the NP DNA vaccine with the protocol of immunization described here is not able to induce efficient cellular immune responses against influenza virus infection in diabetic mice...|$|E
40|$|This book {{presents}} and discusses new directions in plant systems research to bridge knowledge from the gene to plant, crop and agro-ecosystem level and {{to assist in}} solving problems in production ecology and resource use by identifying and applying new research methods. Functional genomics, systems biology and ecophysiological modelling of crop growth and development provide powerful tools for identifying genes and genotypes of agronomic importance. Despite remarkable advances in basic knowledge of plant genes and gene networks, there has been relatively little impact on crop improvement from the application of genomics and <b>recombinant-DNA</b> technology. Novel directions in linking plant sciences to crop and systems research are needed to meet the growing demand for food in a sustainable way. The challenge is to produce more food on the limited available land through more efficient use {{of natural resources and}} external inputs. Genetics of plant performance are discussed using examples of Arabidopsis thaliana and food crops. The concept of 'crop systems biology' is introduced. Within the theme 'physiology and genetics' traits and mechanisms to improve crop adaptation are discussed. Furthermore, various approaches in modelling G × E interactions and crop performance are presented. Some chapters are dedicated to the role of diversity in optimizing resource use and crop performance. An outlook and dialogue on future directions in plant system research challenges readers with contrasting opinions on the way forward concerning this critical issue for the future of food production...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-four {{independent}} nonviable c-locus mutations (types cal, albino lethal and cas, albino subvital), {{derived from}} radiation experiments, were tested for involvement of nearby markers tp, Mod- 2, sh- 1, and Hbb: 10, 22, and 2 involved, respectively, {{none of these}} markers, Mod- 2 alone, and Mod- 2 plus sh- 1. When classified on this basis, as well as according to developmental stage at which homozygotes die, and by limited complementation results, the 34 independent mutations fell into 12 groups. From results of a full-scale complementation grid of all 435 possible crosses among 30 of the mutations, {{we were able to}} postulate an alignment of eight functional units by which the 12 groups fit a linear pattern. Abnormal phenotypes utilized in the complementation study were deaths at various stages of prenatal or postnatal development, body weight, and reduction or absence of various enzymes. Some of these phenotypes can be separated by complementation (e. g., {{there is no evidence that}} mitochondrial malic enzyme influences survival at any age); others cannot thus be separated (e. g., glucose- 6 -phosphatase deficiency and neonatal death). —We conclude that all of the nonviable albino mutations are deficiencies overlapping at c, and ranging in size from < 2 cM to 6 - 11 cM. The characterization of this array of deficiencies should provide useful tools for gene-dosage studies, <b>recombinant-DNA</b> fine-structure analyses, etc. Since many of the combinations of lethals produce viable albino animals that resemble the standard c/c type, we conclude (a) that the c locus contains no sites essential for survival, and (b) that viable nonalbino c-locus mutations (cxv) are the result of mutations within the c cistron. Viable albinos (cav, the majority of radiation-induced c-locus mutations) may be intracistronic mutations or very small deficiencies...|$|E
40|$|In the {{previous}} Chapters of this dissertation the major {{shortcomings of the}} current serological tests for syphilis were investigated. These include an insufficient sensitivity and specificity, reactivity of a diagnostic test long after the syphilitic infection had been cured, complexity of operation, high costs, long test duration, unsuitability for automation, no quantifiable test results available and the inability {{to distinguish between the}} distinct treponematoses. The aim {{of this study was to}} eliminate these shortcomings and to develop and evaluate enzyme immunoassays for serodiagnosis of syphilis. To achieve this, four different performance aspects of the enzyme immunoassays were investigated. These are as follows: 1. A sensitive and a specific treponema! screening test that also permitted treatment monitoring without the phenomenon of serofast test results after adequate treatment and biological false- positive reactions. 2. To reduce the operation time to around 10 to 20 minutes in order to facilitate its use in an outpatient clinic to provide the test results within the course of one consultation. 3. To develop a simple automated confirmation test for syphilis to replace the current confirmation tests that are complex and laborious. 4. To devise a simple, sensitive and specific test for the detection of antitreponemal lgM. Such a test should permit the simultaneous testing of several serum samples and provide automated test results. Integration of tests that meet these objectives will permit simple, sensitive, specific, objective, rapid and automated testing for human antitreponemal lgG and lgM antibodies to detect untreated syphilis, congenital syphilis and to monitor the effect of treatment. Since there are no known antigenic differences between the treponematoses, the distinction between the various treponematoses by serological means was not studied. Therefore, in the experimental chapters of this dissertation the terms "antitreponemal" or "antitreponemal antibody" are used only in relation to syphilis. Enzyme immunoassay methods were investigated in this study in order to exploit their simple operation and extensive possibilities for automation. New acquisitions obtained from modern biochemistry like <b>recombinant-DNA</b> derived antigens, monoclonal antibodies and the newly developed immunofiltration technique for enzyme immunoassays were evaluated to improve syphilis serology...|$|E
40|$|The main {{purposes}} of this thesis were to study mortality and cancer incidence among individuals working in biological and medical (biomedical) research laboratories {{as well as to}} investigate the possible adverse effects on reproduction in female laboratory personnel. This work is based on two cohorts. The study base of the cancer studies included employees who had worked at least one year and a day, 50 % or more of full time, at laboratory departments (n= 5, 035) and at non-laboratory departments (n= 2, 923) at Karolinska Institutet and at the universities of Lund, Gothenburg and Linköping. 70 laboratory departments and 34 non-laboratory departments participated in the study, where the latter were included as an internal reference group. The number of laboratory and non-laboratory research groups participating in the questionnaire-based study of cancer and specific laboratory exposures was 714, encompassing 5288 individuals (3277 laboratory personnel with 1476 men and 1801 women, 2011 non-laboratory personnel with 1290 men and 721 women). The cohort of the reproduction studies comprised 1052 women born in 1945 or later, who had worked for one year or more during the period I January 1990 through 31 December 1994 in a laboratory or non-laboratory department at Karolinska Institutet or at the universities of Gothenburg, Linköping, Lund, Stockholm, Umeå or Uppsala and had given birth to at least one child during that period. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) both for laboratory and non-laboratory personnel indicated lower mortality than for general population. Individual cancer types were studied by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIR). There were an increase of SIRs for brain tumors among male laboratory scientists, 3. 11 (95 % confidence interval 0. 85 - 7. 96) after 10 years of work, and for breast cancer among female scientists, 1. 62 (CI 0. 78 - 2. 98). For women who worked with organic solvents and with carcinogens of class 2 B, elevated SIRs of 2. 73 (CI 1. 10 - 5. 63) and 3. 15 (CI 1. 16 - 6. 85), respectively, were obtained for malignant melanoma. Work with DNA and RNA gave SIRs of 1. 75 (CI 0. 574. 07) and of 1. 78 (CI 0. 584. 14) for female breast cancer. For male personnel, prostate cancer and use of <b>recombinant-DNA</b> techniques gave a SIR of 1. 79 (CI 0. 49 - 4. 59). However, the number of cases for all cancer types in research laboratories was small. The studies of pregnancy outcomes in connection to work with chloroform showed an odds ratio (OR) of 2. 3 and a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 9 - 5. 9 for spontaneous abortions. The OR for 'Large for gestational age' (LGA) infants in association with the mother's laboratory work was 1. 9 (CI 0. 7 - 5. 2) and for male infants in connection to mother's work with radioactive isotopes, 3. 4 (CI 0. 8 - 14. 2). The number of malformations was low in this cohort. For preterm births work with bacteria gave an OR of 2. 7 (CI 1. 2 - 6. 5). Time-to-pregnancy was used to estimate the fecundability, i. e. per cycle probability to conceive a clinically detectable pregnancy. The fecundability ratio (FR) between exposed and unexposed cycles was calculated; a value below unity indicates subfertility. Work with organic solvents in general gave a decreased adjusted fecundability ratio (FR) of 0. 76, 95 % CI of 0. 64 - 0. 89. Moreover, work with cell techniques and use of viruses also showed decreased FRs, 0. 83 (CI 0. 70 - 0. 99) and 0. 73 (CI 0. 56 - 0. 95), respectively, In conclusion, the total mortality as well as the incidence of all cancers together was lower in both the laboratory and the non-laboratory groups than in the general population, but slightly increased risks were seen for male brain tumors and female breast cancer among laboratory personnel. Work with solvents showed an elevated SIR of malignant melanoma in female laboratory personnel. Concerning reproductive health, no major risks were obtained for most outcomes. However, mother's work in laboratory showed an increase of LGA infants and an association was seen between reduced fecundability and use of solvents, cell techniques or viruses...|$|E
