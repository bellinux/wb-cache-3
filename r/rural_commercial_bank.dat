First, we analyze the trend of overall efficiency for each bank type pre- and post-crisis and compare the different efficiency estimations and the efficiency scores of different bank ownership. Second, we give out several hypotheses regarding the potential determinants of Chinese banking efficiency and the possible relationship between bank efficiency and each determinant. The results are compared to the previous hypotheses and empirical researches. Some arguments are reasonably obtained to explain the results considering the existing circumstances of Chinese banking system. The findings of our study provide the evidence that, over the period, the joint-stock banks are the most efficient than other three types of banks, followed by the city <b>commercial</b> <b>banks</b> and <b>rural</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>banks,</b> while the state-owned <b>commercial</b> <b>banks</b> have {{the lowest level of}} all efficiency estimations.

40|$|The China banking reform {{started in}} 1987, for years it is {{processed}} in {{a view of}} improving efficiency and resource allocation. The most recent reform {{have been carried out}} to focus on the joint stock reform related to privatisation and listing of bank shares, liberalisation of business to the foreign banks, encouraging diversifications into intermediary business beyond the traditional deposit and loan activities, and the consolidation reform of the city and <b>rural</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>banks.</b> Meanwhile, the structure change of the China banking sector, and the most recent global financial crisis, all have impact on the China <b>commercial</b> <b>bank</b> performance. We collect a sample of 108 <b>commercial</b> <b>banks</b> from the period 2003 to 2010, and investigate the effect of the determinants on bank performance. To assess whether these objectives have been achieved, this study further investigate how well different types of banks have performed during the sample period. Potential determinants at bank specific level, industry level, and macroeconomic level are examined in the panel data models. We have adopted two dependent variables in our model, which return on average asset (ROAA) as proxy for bank overall performance, and net interest margin (NIM) to detect the traditional interest income profitability. The empirical result suggests that most of the considered determinants factor have statistically significant impact on China banks profitability, and the impact remain stable across bank types, and also the NIM is better explained by the determinants than the ROAA. Capital adequacy ratio, loan to asset ratio and size effect are found to have positive impact on bank performance, whereas liquidity risk is still found to be problematic, and public listing measure is found to be insignificant. The industry variable concentration is found to bring monopoly profits to the large <b>commercial</b> <b>banks,</b> and the opening up statistically found to improve the domestic <b>commercial</b> <b>bank</b> performance, however the impact on foreign bank performance is failed to investigate due to the short sample time period.
