He was sure the Bristol Beaufighter would be perfect for the role, {{but it would not}} be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time. So he selected the Bristol Blenheim light bomber for the immediate term, sending two of the early prototypes to Martlesham Heath to be fitted with the radar from the Battles. Blenheim K7033 was fitted with the radar, while K7034 acted as the target. Both of these aircraft lost a propeller in flight but landed safely; K7033s propeller was never found, but K7034s was returned to Martlesham the next day by an irate farmer.|$|E
500|$|During the riffing of the film, {{the robot}} {{character}} Crow T. Robot claims the film [...] "was {{run through a}} highly technical process called 'tension extraction, and the other robot Tom Servo calls it so dull, [...] "There's {{a point where it}} stops being a movie". Mike and the robots make particular note of film critic Leonard Maltin's relatively high two and-a-half star rating of the original film. The episode also makes several references to McDowall's performances in the Planet of the Apes films, and makes several jokes at the expense of Deezen and his stereotypically nerdy character, at one point dubbing him [...] "heir to the Arnold Stang fortune". Mike and the robots repeatedly sang [...] "Are You <b>Ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>Some</b> Football?" [...] whenever Deputy Ungar appeared on screen due to his resemblance to country singer Hank Williams, Jr.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s Lichtenstein's theme of comics-based work was hotly debated. In a 1963 New York Times article, Brian O'Doherty wrote that Lichtenstein's work was not art, saying Lichtenstein was [...] "one {{of the worst}} artists in America" [...] who [...] "briskly went about making a sow's ear out of a sow's ear." [...] This {{was part of a}} {{widespread}} debate about the merits of Lichtenstein's comic blow-ups as true art. In January 1964 Life ran a story under the title [...] "Is He the Worst Artist in the U.S.?" [...] on this controversy. Later reviews were much kinder. Todd Brewster noted that this may have been motivated by popular demand; he told Life in 1986 that [...] "Those cartoon blowups may have disturbed the critics, but collectors, tired of the solemnity of abstract expressionism, were <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> comic relief. Why couldn't the funny pages be fine art?" [...] His work is now widely accepted, although some criticize him for borrowing from comics without attributing the original creators, paying royalties, or seeking permission from copyright holders. David Barsalou has dedicated decades to identifying all of Lichtenstein's source materials and has posted more than 1,000 images on Flickr detailing Lichtenstein's unrecognized sources.|$|E

500|$|Critics commended the {{development}} of the relationship between Maggie Green and Glenn. Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun stated that the storyline epitomized a [...] "steamy romance", while The Wall Street Journal Aaron Rutkoff called it [...] "the funniest moment of the series." [...] Goldman opined that their sexual encounter felt genuine; [...] "He's a nice guy, she seems like a cool gal, and it felt genuine when she noted she felt plenty lonely too and <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> companionship." [...] Nick Venable of Cinema Blend asserted that the interactions between Maggie and Glenn was the highlight of the episode. [...] "I'm glad the writers are introducing this comic book plot point, as this show seriously needs a couple without closets full of skeletons. When Glenn accidentally grabs a box of condoms for Maggie to see, I chuckled heartily. The ensuing conversation also made me smile, which makes me wonder why humor is paid the least amount of attention on the show." [...] Jackson was surprised with the scene, and called it [...] "unexpected". Jen Chenay of The Washington Post compared Glenn to Little Mikey from the Life advertisements, and summated: [...] "He has assumed this role without much choice in the matter, but he has done so with a certain quiet, occasionally petrified, baseball-cap-wearing dignity that makes him admirable." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{extent of}} Digby's {{knowledge}} of the plot is unknown, but {{in the opinion of}} author Alan Haynes, Digby was shocked by what he heard, and asked what would become of some of their Catholic friends. [...] Catesby replied [...] "Assure your selfe that such of the nobilitie as are worth the saving shalbe preserved and yet knowe not of the matter." [...] None of their friends would be caught in the explosion. [...] He asked if Catesby had spoken of the matter with Garnet, or any other Jesuits; although Catesby was in no doubt that the Jesuits disapproved of any such action, he lied and said that he would not act without their approbation. [...] Catesby then named the other conspirators, and promised Digby that as soon as they reached Gayhurst he would demonstrate that their religion allowed such acts of regicide, thus dissuading the young lord from confessing to Garnet and discovering the Jesuit's opinion of the matter. [...] Catesby told him to rent Coughton Court from the head of the Throckmorton family, so that he would [...] "the better {{to be able to do}} good to the cause [...] ". [...] From there, he was to organise a hunting party (in reality a group of armed men on horseback) and be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> kind of military manoeuvre. [...] Digby also provided monetary assistance; he promised £1,500 after fellow plotter Thomas Percy failed to pay the rent due for several properties in Westminster.|$|E
500|$|Mileena was {{described}} by Computer and Video Games as [...] "equally erotic and repulsive". According to IGN, [...] "at first blush she seems like your quintessential sultry video-game vixen, but the mask comes off and she's got a gaping mouth filled {{to the brim with}} dagger-like teeth." [...] In 2008, IGN's Scott Collura listed [...] "Mileen-ewwwwww" [...] as one of [...] "top 50 chicks behaving badly," [...] while GamesRadar included her on the list of [...] "gaming's most repellent anti-babes". Comparing the Mortal Kombat characters to the seven deadly sins in Dante's Inferno, Chris Holt of GamePro chose Mileena to represent Envy. Aaron Koehn of GamePro placed Mileena and Kitana eleventh on his 2009 list of the best palette-swapped video game characters, but wrote that [...] "if you gauge Mileena's attractiveness simply based on the size of her baby-feeders, be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> disappointment when she removes her mask." [...] ScrewAttack ranked her as seventh on their list of the top ten [...] "ugly chicks in games" [...] for her horrific looks when unmasked, but otherwise calling her [...] "the ultimate woman." [...] Virgin Media included her on their list of the ten [...] "game girls you wouldn't dare to date" [...] for being attractive [...] "until she rips off her veil and reveals her monstrous form beneath." [...] Destructoid's Nick Chester commented: [...] "Her story, as far as I'm concerned, is that she needs to see a dentist." [...] On the other hand, EGMs Eric L. Patterson, stating his preference of Mileena over Kitana, wrote that Mileena's face is actually {{one of the reasons why}} he likes her. Reviewing the Vita version of MK2011, GamesRadar's Jack DeVries called it [...] "as pretty as Mileena minus mask, but overall, just as viciously fun." [...] Ranking Mileena as second on his 2013 list of ugliest video game characters, Alex Langley of Arcade Sushi wrote: [...] "If ever there were a time to use the term 'butterface' it would be with Mileena, because everything about her is hot...but her face. Her face will friggin' bite your face off, which is never a sign of a good date." [...] Ramon Hagenbeuk of Dutch XGN included Mileena among the [...] "top 10 ugly game chicks" [...] in 2015 due to her face despite [...] "her nice figure". French magazine Retropolis placed Mileena second in a 2013 ranking of the sexiest girls in fighting games in which her bust was the criteria for her [...] "reverse décolleté" [...] approach to fashion after Mortal Kombat II, while comparing the character to shrimp in regards to her physical appearance: [...] "Everything is good except for the head." [...] Playboy included Mileena, Kitana, and Jade together in their list of [...] "the hottest video game breasts of all time" [...] at 19th place.|$|E

2500|$|That year, the tease was {{followed}} by the show open produced by Los Angeles-based The Syndicate called [...] "Transformation". It features computer-generated imagery showing a city being transformed into a football stadium and passers-by on the street turning into players, coaches, fans and officials set to an updated orchestral treatment of the [...] "Heavy Action" [...] theme song. The sequence began every week with a different celebrity walking down the street, picking up a glowing football helmet with the ESPN logo on the side and saying, [...] "I'm <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> football!
