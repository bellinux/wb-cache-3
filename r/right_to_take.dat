The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E

Queen Victoria granted the BSAC a royal charter to administer and develop these territories on 29 October 1889, for an initial period of 25 years.

To {{conclude}} the civil war, the two kings' envoys signed the Treaty of Várad on 24February 1538, which confirmed both kings' right to retain the lands that they held.

John also stipulated, if he fathered a son, his son would inherit his ancestral domains. Ferdinand, however, proved unable to protect John's realm against an Ottoman invasion. At age 52 John married Isabella Jagiellon, the 22-year-old daughter of Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland, on 2March 1539.

40|$|Dr. Elizabeth Jane MacphersonIndigenous {{groups in}} Australia have been {{historically}} excluded, {{and continue to}} be excluded, from water law frameworks. <b>Rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> and use water attached to landholding until the late twentieth century. However, neither the common law nor statute recognised or allocated indigenous-specific <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> land in Australia until the late twentieth century. Because indigenous groups did not usually hold land titles, they did not enjoy corresponding <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> and use water. Indigenous exclusion from water law frameworks was reinforced when Australian States ‘unbundled’ <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> and use water from land titles, which also took place {{at the end of the}} twentieth century, when indigenous groups had begun to obtain indigenous-specific land titles. As a consequence of unbundling, even if indigenous groups were belatedly accorded indigenous-specific land rights, they would not, as a matter of water law, enjoy <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> and use water in the way that might have occurred had their land rights been recognised earlier. In fact, because of unbundling, others could now purchase <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> and use water resources on or affecting indigenous-specific lands. Although indigenous-specific land now exceeds 30 per cent of total land in Australia, indigenous-specific water use rights are estimated at only 0. 01 per cent of total Australian water allocations. Debates about indigenous water rights in Australia focus on the potential for indigenous water <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> be recognised as part of a native title determination. However, native title, as it has developed through the decisions of the Australian courts and Parliament, has failed to recognise indigenous water rights for commercial purposes. In the early 1990 s, the Chilean Parliament passed a law providing indigenous-specific landholders with <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> use water for commercial purposes. In this thesis, I use a study of Chilean law and experience to argue for the statutory allocation of commercial water <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> indigenous-specific landholders in Australia, as a supplement to the native title recognition model for traditional-cultural rights. The Chilean study helps elucidate why indigenous-specific landholders should be provided with commercial water rights, by emphasising the need to respond to indigenous disadvantage in the distribution of water use rights as an ongoing consequence of historical water exclusion. Once the focus of indigenous water rights shifts from recognising pre-sovereignty interests to addressing ongoing injustice in water rights distribution, there is little question that indigenous water rights must extend beyond traditional-cultural purposes. Addressing this distributive injustice aligns with government commitments to support indigenous economic development. It may even improve the certainty of water use rights for efficient water markets, as a response to political demands for water rights by indigenous groups. The Chilean study also offers insights into how a statutory allocation model might be used to allocate commercial water <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> indigenous-specific landholders as a supplement to the legal recognition of pre-sovereignty rights. Recognising pre-sovereignty water rights is problematic when justice requires attention to indigenous disadvantage as well as to traditional customary connections to land and water. Few indigenous groups continue to enjoy relationships with water resources in the same way as they did pre-sovereignty, and other rightholders now hold <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> use the same resources. Although the unbundling of water use rights from land titles is often presented as the cause of indigenous water exclusion, unbundling also represents an opportunity to respond to that exclusion. Because water use rights are now held independently of land, they may be redistributed to indigenous-specific landholders via water savings and purchase mechanisms, in a way that both responds to, and exploits, the water market...|$|R
