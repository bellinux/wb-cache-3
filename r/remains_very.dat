5|$|Between 20% and 50% of high-risk cases do {{not respond}} {{adequately}} to induction high-dose chemotherapy and are progressive or refractory. Relapse after completion of frontline therapy is also common. Further treatment is available in phase I and phase II clinical trials that test new agents and combinations of agents against neuroblastoma, but the outcome <b>remains</b> <b>very</b> poor for relapsed high-risk disease.|$|E

The roadway {{is referred to as the}} Bluewater Highway because it <b>remains</b> <b>very</b> close to the eastern shoreline of Lake Huron.|$|E
5|$|Stout, {{a kind of}} porter beer, {{particularly}} Guinness, {{is typically}} associated with Ireland, although historically it was more closely associated with London. Porter <b>remains</b> <b>very</b> popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to lager. Cider, particularly Magners (marketed in the Republic of Ireland as Bulmers), is also a popular drink. Red lemonade, a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, particularly with whiskey.|$|E
5|$|The {{mining sector}} <b>remains</b> <b>very</b> lucrative, {{with some of}} the world's largest {{platinum}} reserves being mined by Anglo American plc and Impala Platinum. The Marange diamond fields, discovered in 2006, are considered the biggest diamond find in over a century.

It has been featured in television and film, including in Hamish Macbeth and in advertising by companies such as Cesar dog food and Scottish whisky Black & White. It is a medium-sized terrier, although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance. The breed can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active and intelligent breed, and is social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt rodents.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem is}} that any small {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today <b>remains</b> <b>very</b> close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{sufficiency}} has {{fallen out of}} favor in descriptive statistics because of the strong dependence on an assumption of the distributional form (see Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem below), but <b>remains</b> <b>very</b> important in theoretical work.|$|E
