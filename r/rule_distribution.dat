While having played crucial roles in securing these networks, firewalls themselves {{are subject to}} performance limitations. An overloaded firewall can cause severe damage to the protected enterprise network, because any legitimate communication through it is either degraded or even completely severed. In this paper, we address how to dynamically balance packet filtering workloads on distributed firewalls efficiently in large enterprise networks. We model dynamic load balancing on distributed firewalls as a minimax optimization problem, and show that it is strongly NP-complete even if we eliminate all precedence relationships among policy rules by rule rewriting. Accordingly, we propose a light-weight <b>rule</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme that quickly balances workloads among all firewalls. Our scheme is adaptive to incoming traffic. Moreover, dynamically placing and ordering policy rules on distributed firewalls reduces the probability that attackers successfully infer the <b>rule</b> <b>distribution.</b> Experimental results show that using a commodity PC, our approach can reduce the peak firewall workload in distributed firewall systems by 40 % within less than five minutes, compared against alternative solutions that only optimize rule ordering on individual firewalls.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the role of}} response fluency on a well-known intelligence test, Raven's (1962) Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) test. Critical in solving this test is finding rules that govern the items. Response fluency is conceptualized as generation speed or {{the speed at which}} a person generates (samples) rules from some (statistical) <b>rule</b> <b>distribution.</b> We claim that a person's ability to induce relations in the APM test may be translated as the speed at which this person samples rules (candidate relations) from this distribution. This is examined by administering and comparing two types of tasks, first APM itself, and second, a homemade task which is intended to measure the speed component only. It is found that rule sampling distributions do not differ greatly between persons, but that the speed at which people sample from such distributions is an important variable in solving APM items...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOne of {{the basic}} {{socio-economic}} problems {{is the problem of}} distribution of benefits and dues. The historically shaped principles of justice direct the {{solution to the problem of}} the Aristotelian rule of proportionality. But applying this rule not always gives the expected, satisfactory solutions. This occurs, for instance, regarding the allocation of seats among the member states in the European Parliament. For this reason, the principle of degressive proportionality was legitimized. Although the definition appears in the context of the European Parliament, the application of the <b>rule</b> <b>distribution</b> may be much wider due to certain universal priorities it embodies. The principle of degressive proportionality, however, has a significant drawback, namely, it does not clearly provide a exact division. This lack of clarity results in the fact that within the rule there may appear many different proposals. The article is an attempt to evaluate some of the proposals by the criterion of drawing nearer the most, under certain assumptions, degressively proportional allocation to the proportional one and proposing rules for determining the boundary conditions for such allocation...|$|E

All ambiguities in the choice of the representation can be derived from the following operations: 1. The transformation IK → not IK together with OK → not OK and Odefault → not Odefault. 2. Permutations among a set of inputs im, [...] ., im+p such that Om = · · · = Om+p. The values of Im, [...] ., Im+p are permutated {{in the same way as}} im, [...] ., im+p. A unique representation is created from any choice of parameters in two steps. First, 1. is applied if OK ̸ = OK− 1, which ensures that OK = OK− 1. In order to handle the special case K = 1 in a convenient way we define O 0 = false. Second, all intervals of inputs im, [...] ., im+p such that 2. can be applied are identified and permutated so that Im = · · · = Im+q = false and Im+q+ 1 = · · · = Im+p = true for some q, 0 ≤ q ≤ p.

As {{the complexity and}} tempo of the world increase, C 2 systems must move to a paradigm that supports dynamic modification of system behavior in complex, changing environments. Separation of rules from executable code provides the foundation for dynamic system behavior and agile response to outside events. A Rule Language Standard is required to realize the full benefits of rule separation including the sharing of rule abstractions across disparate domains and enabling interoperability across the enterprise. As engineers and researchers at MITRE, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) for the DoD, we initiated a three-year effort to identify DoD requirements {{that need to be}} addressed by the Rule layer of the Semantic Web. We are investigating the interaction between the rule and ontology layers of the Semantic Web to determine how a standard language should evolve to meet critical DoD requirements. In particular, we are examining specification, translation and execution of the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) language vs. Web Ontology Language (OWL) +RuleML to determine if the ontology and rule layers are best integrated or layered. We are exploring the orchestration of inferencing across layers this year. In future years, our research will address adaptable policy enforcement using ontologies enhanced with rules, dynamic <b>rule</b> <b>distribution,</b> ontological closure and rule annotation for discovery and reuse. We will demonstrate how rules can be used for agile management of information flows in complex, dynamic C 2 environments. Throughout this three year effort, we continue to look ahead to anticipate future requirements for the emerging standard. ...|$|E

Due to the destructiveness and concealment of gob, conducting systematic actual measurement for multi-species gas of gob tends to be of greater difficulty, and even harder to achieve. Therefore, the numerical technique has increasingly become the main mean to study the issue. Many scholars {{at home and abroad}} had carried out a number of fruitful research work to solve this problem by using the numerical simulation technique: combined with the laboratory test result of rock strength and the relationship of stress- permeability coefficient, P established CFD three-dimensional simulation, conducting the analytical investigation on gas migration <b>rule</b> and gas <b>distribution</b> <b>rule</b> under extraction conditions for gob of longwall face[1]; established a CFD three-dimensional model, R and other scholars particularly studied the <b>distribution</b> <b>rule</b> of gas in gob under different ventilation and extraction conditions[2], [3]; by using the developed CFD three-dimensional model, Hu, Li and other scholars simulated the flowing ruleof gas in gob [4] and the rhythm rule of gas under the drainage of surface drilling condition[5]; developed the CFD model of oxygen distribution in gob, Shi and other scholars studied the <b>distribution</b> <b>rule</b> of oxidation zone in gob and its relation with the amount of air distribution[6, 7].

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a variation of}} the resource allocation problem. In the traditional problem, there is a global planner who would like to assign a set of players to a set of resources so as to maximize welfare. We consider the situation where the global planner does not have the authority to assign players to resources; rather, players are self-interested. The question that emerges is how can the global planner entice the players to settle on a desirable allocation with respect to the global welfare? To study this question, we focus on a class of games that we refer to as distributed welfare games. Within this context, we investigate how the global planner should distribute the welfare to the players. We measure the efficacy of a <b>distribution</b> <b>rule</b> in two ways: (i) Does a pure Nash equilibrium exist? (ii) How does the welfare associated with a pure Nash equilibrium compare to the global welfare associated with the optimal allocation? In this paper we explore the applicability of cost sharing methodologies for distributing welfare in such resource allocation problems. We demonstrate that obtaining desirable <b>distribution</b> <b>rules,</b> such as <b>distribution</b> <b>rules</b> that are budget balanced and guarantee the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium, often comes at a significant informational and computational cost. In light of this, we derive a systematic procedure for designing desirable <b>distribution</b> <b>rules</b> with a minimal informational and computational cost for a special class of distributed welfare games. Furthermore, we derive a bound on the price of anarchy for distributed welfare games in a variety of settings. Lastly, we highlight the implications of these results using the problem of sensor coverage...|$|R
