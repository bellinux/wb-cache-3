I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you <b>really</b> <b>will</b> finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E

500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s {{a number of}} American {{painters}} began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips. Roy Lichtenstein made drawings of comic strip characters in 1958. Andy Warhol produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960. Lichtenstein, unaware of Warhol's work, produced Look Mickey and Popeye in 1961. Although Warhol had produced silkscreens of comic strips and of other pop art subjects, he supposedly relegated himself to Campbell's Soup Cans as a subject {{at the time to}} avoid competing with the more finished style of comics by Lichtenstein. He once said [...] "I've got to do something that <b>really</b> <b>will</b> have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing." ...|$|E

500|$|Nixon saw his {{policies}} regarding Vietnam, China, and the Soviets as {{key to his}} place in history. George McGovern, Nixon's onetime opponent, commented in 1983, [...] "President Nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers, China and the Soviet Union, than any other president since World War II... With the exception of his inexcusable continuation {{of the war in}} Vietnam, Nixon <b>really</b> <b>will</b> get high marks in history." [...] Political scientist Jussi Hanhimäki disagrees, saying Nixon's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the Cold War policy of containment, using diplomatic rather than military means. Historian Christopher Andrew concludes that [...] "Nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as a shabby practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena. While the criminal farce of Watergate was in the making, Nixon's inspirational statesmanship was establishing new working relationships with both Communist China and the Soviet Union." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the comic}} book phase of his career, Lichtenstein often {{slightly}} altered the colorization of the original source. According to Marco Livingstone, his early comic subjects comprise a [...] "loose and improvised style clearly derived from de Kooning." [...] Art historian Jonathan Fineberg describes a Lichtenstein painting of 1960 as an [...] "...abstract expressionist picture with Mickey Mouse in it, related stylistically to the de Kooning Women". When Leo Castelli saw both Lichtenstein's and Warhol's large comic strip-based works, he elected to show only Lichtenstein's, causing Warhol to create the Campbell's Soup Cans series to avoid competing with the more refined style of comics Lichtenstein was then producing. He once said [...] "I've {{got to do something}} that <b>really</b> <b>will</b> have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing." [...] Lichtenstein's foray into comics led to the abandonment of the topic by Warhol. Although Lichtenstein continued to work with comic sources, after 1961 he avoided the easily identified sources like Popeye and Mickey Mouse.|$|E

Comparisons were also drawn towards [...] "Fembot" [...] from Body Talk Pt. 1, and [...] "Piece of Me" [...] by Britney Spears. [...] "U Should Know Better" [...] featuring Snoop Dogg was called the album's highlight by several critics. It features Snoop Dogg rapping over an electro beat and Robyn delivering [...] "quotable, ridiculous lines", such as [...] "You know when in Rome I {{sat down with the}} Romans.

[...] Jaime Gill of BBC Music said that the song features [...] "the teen-pop singer and hip hop outlaw swapping louche quips over a relentless, grimy electro stomp."

500|$|Although Warhol had {{produced}} silkscreens of comic strips and of other pop art subjects, he supposedly relegated himself to soup cans {{as a subject}} {{at the time to}} avoid competing with the more finished style of comics by Roy Lichtenstein. He once said [...] "I've got to do something that <b>really</b> <b>will</b> have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing." [...] In February 1962, Lichtenstein displayed at a sold-out exhibition of cartoon pictures at Leo Castelli's eponymous Leo Castelli Gallery, ending the possibility of Warhol exhibiting his own cartoon paintings. Castelli had visited Warhol's gallery in 1961 and said that the work he saw there was too similar to Lichtenstein's, although Warhol's and Lichtenstein's comic artwork differed in subject and techniques (e.g., Warhol's comic-strip figures were humorous pop culture caricatures such as Popeye, while Lichtenstein's were generally of stereotypical hero and heroines, inspired by comic strips devoted to adventure and romance). Castelli chose not to represent both artists at that time, but he would, in 1964, exhibit Warhol works such as reproductions of Campbell's Tomato Juice Box, 1964 (pictured above, left), and Brillo Soap Boxes. He would again exhibit Warhol's work in 1966. Lichtenstein's 1962 show was quickly followed by Wayne Thiebaud's April 17, 1962 one-man show at the Allan Stone Gallery featuring all-American foods, which agitated Warhol as he felt it jeopardized his own food-related soup can works. Warhol was considering returning to the Bodley gallery, but the Bodley's director did not like his pop art works. In 1961, Warhol was offered a three-man show by Allan Stone at the latter's 18 East 82nd Street Gallery with Rosenquist and Robert Indiana, but all three were insulted by this proposition.|$|E

[...] He then discusses instances such as when men have been instructed to be stoic, or stern, to hide their emotions. [...] He continues:In general we could say that men and women, {{in and out of}} the Church, have been taunted and titillated with views concerning man, woman, priesthood, and family that are at odds with the revealed word and thus with [...] "things as they really are, and...as they <b>really</b> <b>will</b> be" [...] (Jacob 4:13). ...No person who revolts against the divinely established role and calling he or she was given before the foundations of this earth were laid can be happy or find real fulfillment, not here or in eternity.|$|E

I think kids will think he is the rude Doctor [...] You might want to cuddle him but he <b>really</b> <b>will</b> resist." [...] It has been said that part of the Doctor's personality will share [...] "a certain acid wit" [...] of Malcolm Tucker, the role Peter Capaldi is most famous for, [...] "specifically the attitude, the wisecracks and the energy...he can be edgy, volatile and dangerous". Capaldi has stated that all of the previous actors who had played the Doctor were channelled in his portrayal and that his particular influences were Hartnell, Pertwee and Davison.|$|E
2500|$|In the humiliating {{aftermath}} of Suez in 1956, Lady Avon's most famous public remark {{to a group}} of Conservative woman that, [...] "in the past few weeks I have really felt as if the Suez Canal was flowing through my drawing room", was widely reported. Lady Avon has since described this observation as [...] "silly, really idiotic", though it remains probably the most quoted utterance of the whole crisis. One example of its durability was a journalist's observation some 54 years later, with reference to the Iraq War of 2003, that [...] "if, as Clarissa Eden remarked, the Suez Canal ran through her drawing room, Iraq and the decisions that flowed from it still haunt [...] Labour [...] and stir up antipathies and discomforts". Another instance was in 2013 when options for airport expansion around London were being debated. Journalist Rachel Johnson, sister of London's mayor Boris Johnson, recalled Lady Avon's remark and added, [...] "But for those of us in West London, any further expansion to Heathrow and the airport <b>really</b> <b>will</b> be in our back yards". More directly, The Times newspaper cited Lady Avon's words in 2011 in connection with a call by the outgoing Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus (later Lord) O'Donnell for Prime Ministerial spouses to receive greater support from public funds: [...] "In a constitutional monarchy, the consort of the prime minister is not an official role ... Yet, as the Countess of Avon so vividly pointed out, it can be impossible to keep public scrutiny at bay altogether". In Lady Avon's view, both she and her husband [...] "were quite naive about how the press works. Neither of us should have been, but we were." ...|$|E
