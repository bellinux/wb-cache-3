These purges replaced most of the party's old guard with younger officials who did not <b>remember</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> before Stalin's leadership and who were regarded as more personally loyal to him. Party functionaries readily carried out their commands and sought to ingratiate themselves with Stalin to avoid becoming the victim of the purge.|$|E

One pundit wrote that [...] "Most Malaysians could not <b>remember</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of greater prosperity or lesser inter-ethnic recrimination.... Economic indicators alone would not have captured the pride that Malaysians had discovered, perhaps for [...] first time, in being Malaysian." ...|$|E
500|$|African-American {{literature}} scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe calls Angelou's {{depiction of}} the rape [...] "a burden" [...] of Caged Bird: a demonstration of [...] "the {{manner in which the}} Black female is violated in her tender years and... the 'unnecessary insult' of Southern girlhood in her movement to adolescence". Vermillion goes further, maintaining that a Black woman who writes about her rape risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about her race and gender. When asked decades later how she was able to survive such trauma, Angelou explained it by stating, [...] "I can't <b>remember</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when I wasn't loved by somebody." [...] When asked by the same interviewer why she wrote about the experience, she indicated that she wanted to demonstrate the complexities of rape. [...] She also wanted to prevent it from happening to someone else, so that anyone who had been raped might gain understanding and not blame herself for it.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} favorable response from critics, who praised its simplicity. According to Crystal Bell of The Huffington Post, Madonna {{was able to}} portray a rich life {{like that in the}} 1960 film, La Dolce Vita. Amanda Dobbins of New York gave props to Madonna for looking good in a leotard and for giving break to the young actors accompanying her in the video. Brett Warner of the website Ology appreciated the vintage feel of the video writing: [...] "Heavy sigh. <b>Remember</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when pop videos didn't have to shimmer and sparkle, when you didn't need choreographed dance routines or outlandish costumes? Remember when cars and cleavage was enough? Madonna clearly does." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator agreed, writing that the video is [...] "the most fun visual [...] offered up in years... All in all, a fantastic video for one of the more mediocre tracks off MDNA." [...] Mark Hogan from Spin noted that the video appeared a literal take on the song's lyrics but the change of scenery to the Italian countryside and the party scenes made it endearing. Melinda Newman from HitFix said that although the video did not live up to Madonna's other endeavors, it fit the [...] "carefree" [...] theme of the song. She found influences of Italian film director Federico Fellini's works, especially his 1957 release Nights of Cabiria, in the scene showing Madonna picking up prostitutes in her car.|$|E

2500|$|Hugh Laurie as Senator Tom James: {{a charming}} senator and Selina's new running mate after Doyle leaves the ticket. He is {{extremely}} popular with his colleagues and with voters. Selina {{was reluctant to}} pick him as a running mate {{out of fear that}} he would <b>remember</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> they nearly slept together. He frustrates Meyer at his desire to be involved with the economy, {{going so far as to}} request to serve simultaneously as Vice President and Secretary of the Treasury. In the general election, loophole rules in the Constitution dictate that in certain circumstances, James could become the Acting President (and subsequently President), further angering Selina. He offers that, should this occur, he would like her to be his Vice President. She later appoints him as her economy czar. Before the fourth season, Armando Iannucci met with Laurie in the UK after learning that he was a fan of Veep. The two began developing the character Tom James alongside the show's writers (also based in the UK). Iannucci describes Tom James as a [...] "normal, but ambitious operator ... this is someone who seems to outdo [...] in his ability." [...] (Seasons 4–6) ...|$|E

I reseated myself on the sofa, and without delay or preface I laid before her my plan of collaboration with the sisters of the House of Martha; explaining how much better a man could attend to certain outside business than the sisters could do it, and showing how, in a manner, I proposed to become a brother of the House of Martha.
