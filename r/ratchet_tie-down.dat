40|$|This design report {{details the}} design process {{utilized}} by Adaptive Exercise Designs (AED) in creating the sixth design of the Universal Play Frame (UPF). The UPF is an adaptive frame which supports a variety of devices that allows athletes in wheelchairs with limited range of motion to participate in physical activity. The past five frame designs {{do not meet the}} needs of the Friday Club due to complications with function and time constraints. To ensure all of Fridays Club 2 ̆ 7 s needs were met, the problem was better defined by converting the customer requirements into engineering specifications. The design process our team followed was guided by the engineering specifications and is presented in detail in this report. The final dimensions of the UPF VI that varied from the original anticipated design are summarized as follows. The UPF VI utilizes four 12 ’’ wheels instead of two wheels like the previous UPFs. The additional and larger wheels will improve the frame 2 ̆ 7 s ability to maneuver over different terrain. In the final design the frame weighs approximately 50 lbs. The frame is 40 ’’ wide (fixed width) to provide clearance for the user’s wheelchair and for the UPF wheels to rotate. The height adjusts between the range of 34 ’’ and 42 ’’ and has a maximum length of 74 ” in order to accommodate different height and length wheelchairs. The Cargo Buckle <b>ratchet</b> <b>tie-down</b> was selected as a new method of attachment in order to allow for a quick and easy connection of the UPF to the wheelchair. The UPF VI cost a total of 1, 239. 65, which includes an estimated 130. 00 for a powder coat to improve the visual aesthetics of the UPF...|$|E
50|$|Open {{commercial}} car carrier trailers typically have a double-decker design, with both decks subdivided {{into a number}} of loading and storage ramps that can be tilted and lifted independently of one another with hydraulics. Unlike flatbed tow trucks, which often need to transport non-running vehicles, car carrier trailers are not equipped with loaders or winches, instead relying on the vehicles to be loaded under their own power. The trailer hydraulics allow the ramps to be aligned on a slope so cars can be driven up and secured to the ramp floor with chains, <b>tie-down</b> <b>ratchets</b> or wheel straps, after which the ramp can be tilted in any direction to optimize stacking.|$|R
