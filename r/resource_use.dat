5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of {{the relevance of the}} Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for <b>resource</b> <b>use</b> to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit <b>resource</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
40|$|To <b>use</b> water <b>resources</b> efficiently, {{it becomes}} {{necessary}} {{to introduce a}} water market which connects the agricultural sector with the non-agricultural sector. 　In this paper, I will discuss about a farmer's subjective equilibrium associated with water and other <b>resources</b> <b>use,</b> and the efficiency of water and other <b>resources</b> <b>use</b> when a water market is introduced. 　From the standpoint of minimizing social losses associated with water and other <b>resources</b> <b>use,</b> {{we can say that}} introduction of a water market is benefitial to society. However, water pricing policies will give big impacts not only on water <b>resources</b> <b>use</b> but on other <b>resources</b> <b>use.</b> Therefore, when we discuss about making a water market, we must pay attention to introducing what kinds of water pricing policies...|$|R

Variables used to partition patient-year charges into isoresource consumption groups are age, race, number of health problems or major diagnostic categories addressed, number of medications or categories of medications prescribed, and indexes developed to reflect <b>resources</b> <b>used</b> by diagnostic categories during a patient-year.

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates <b>resource</b> <b>use</b> to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied <b>resource</b> <b>use</b> (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E
5|$|There are {{conflicting}} views whether {{improvements in}} technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling {{of economic growth}} from environmental degradation. On the one hand, it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that <b>resource</b> <b>use</b> intensity (i.e., energy and materials use per unit GDP) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold, thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution. On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in {{the efficiency of the}} use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth, {{in large part because of}} the rebound effect (conservation) or Jevons Paradox resulting in a net increase in <b>resource</b> <b>use</b> and associated pollution. Furthermore, there are inherent thermodynamic (i.e., second law of thermodynamics) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements. For example, there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food, and there are limits to making automobiles, houses, furniture, and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions. Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase <b>resource</b> <b>use</b> efficiencies indefinitely, it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution, i.e., economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run. Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total GDP remains more or less constant, as has been advocated for decades by Herman Daly and others in the ecological economics community.|$|E
5|$|The {{region has}} been used by humans for centuries. Obsidian was {{collected}} by Mono Paiutes for making sharp tools and arrow points. Glassy rock continues to be removed in modern times for use as commercial scour and yard decoration. Mono Mills processed timber felled on or near the volcanoes for the nearby boomtown Bodie in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Water diversions into the Los Angeles Aqueduct system from their natural outlets in Mono Lake started in 1941 after a water tunnel was cut under the Mono Craters. Mono Lake Volcanic Field and {{a large part of the}} Mono Craters gained some protection under Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984. <b>Resource</b> <b>use</b> along all of the chain is managed by the United States Forest Service as part of Inyo National Forest. Various activities are possible along the chain, including hiking, bird watching, canoeing, skiing, and mountain biking.|$|E

5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces <b>resource</b> <b>use,</b> other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} meat ants on other species varies, {{depending}} on the habitat and type of food source, and the ecological role the ant plays. The deliberate exclusion of meat ants show that not only can they alter the amount of sources available, but the dynamics of <b>resource</b> <b>use</b> on entire outcrops. If present, meat ants rely on rapidly discovering food sources and retain their dominance so other ants cannot collect them, as well as exploitation and interference which helps displace other ants. The habitat meat ants live in may affect their dominance among the fauna. They are less successful in complex habitats and more successful in open areas, allowing workers to forage efficiently; for example, workers forage around rocks and collect food sources more successfully in contrast to those in vegetation. Meat ants are even more dominant than other I. purpureus species group members in non-complex habitats. Meat ants are normally larger than other Iridomyrmex species and can displace or even kill those trying to compete for food sources. The similar behaviours among meat ants and certain Iridomyrmex species have increased the level of conflict among each other, especially those in open habitats.|$|E
