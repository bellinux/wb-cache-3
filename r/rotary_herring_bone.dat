The origins of Möllan can be traced back to the twelfth century A.D. At this time, Skanör was Northern Europe's largest trading harbour for herring. At the annual herring market, up to 70000 people gathered in Skanör to buy and sell herring. Möllan was built on order of the Danish king to simplify the grounding of <b>herring</b> <b>bones.</b> Ground <b>herring</b> <b>bones,</b> known as [...] "Sillamjöl", was a common ingredient in the medicine of the time and also a popular aphrodisiac.|$|R

40|$|Long-term use of herring by Alaska Natives is not {{well-documented}} over {{space or}} through time, yet this information can illuminate pre-industrial patterns of herring abundance and distribution. Such information {{is important to}} understand the sustained relationships Alaska Native fishers and egg collectors have had with herring. Understanding the genetics of pre-industrial herring may also inform management of the fish and fisheries to insure their survival into the future. In this paper, we attempt a contextualized account of the long-term history of Alaska Native herring fisheries, bringing together archaeological, ethnographic, and ethnohistorical data. We tie these together as background for presenting the preliminary results of the NSF-funded project, The Archaeology of Herring: Reconstructing the Past to Redeem the Future (No. 1203868). We have now tested 84 <b>herring</b> <b>bone</b> samples from 17 archaeological sites in Alaska expanding beyond Speller et al. (2012), having tripled the earlier archaeological dataset. The oldest <b>herring</b> <b>bones</b> identified archaeologically in Alaska are dated to more than 10, 000 cal BP. Early Holocene and Middle Holocene sites have also yielded <b>herring</b> <b>bones,</b> although most of the record dates to the last 2400 years. Preservation of genetic information is effectively complete for the last 2400 years, but achievable back to the terminal Pleistocene (68 % success rate for samples between 10, 500 and 2400 cal BP). This gives considerable confidence to the potential to expand the analyses and develop a richer pattern of biological variability. The resulting data show genetic continuity between archaeological and modern herring populations. The main technical challenge for the future is to extract adequate amounts of nuclear DNA from the ancient samples for identifying more informative DNA markers {{that can be used to}} more effectively reveal any population diversity and/or population size changes over time when compared to modern herring...|$|R

40|$|Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) are an {{abundant}} and {{important component of}} the coastal ecosystems for the west coast of North America. Current Canadian federal herring management assumes five regional herring populations in British Columbia {{with a high degree of}} exchange between units, and few distinct local populations within them. Indigenous traditional knowledge and historic sources, however, suggest that locally adapted, distinct regional herring populations may have been more prevalent in the past. Within the last century, the combined effects of commercial fishing and other anthropogenic factors have resulted in severe declines of herring populations, with contemporary populations potentially reflecting only the remnants of a previously more abundant and genetically diverse metapopulation. Through the analysis of 85 archaeological <b>herring</b> <b>bones,</b> this study attempted to reconstruct the genetic diversity and population structure of ancient herring populations using three different marker systems (mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), microsatellites and SNPs). A high success rate (91 %) of DNA recovery was obtained from the extremely small <b>herring</b> <b>bone</b> samples (often < 10 mg). The ancient herring mtDNA revealed high haplotype diversity comparable to modern populations, although population discrimination was not possible due to the limited power of the mtDNA marker. Ancient microsatellite diversity was also similar to modern samples, but the data quality was compromised by large allele drop-out and stuttering. In contrast, SNPs were found to have low error rates with no evidence for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and simulations indicated high power to detect genetic differentiation if loci under selection are used. This study demonstrates that SNPs may be the most effective and feasible approach to survey genetic population structure in ancient remains, and further efforts should be made to screen for high differentiation markers. This study provides the much needed foundation for wider scale studies on temporal genetic variation in herring, with important implications for herring fisheries management, Aboriginal title rights and herring conservation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an X-ray diffraction {{study of the}} smectic B (S B) phase that some mesomorphic side chain polysiloxanes display. Since no true monocrystals were available, this study was performed on magnetically aligned samples which possess a fiber geometry. We have first investigated the structure of this polymeric SB phase. Its organization is {{similar to those of}} the classical SB phases (of small mesogens) : the mesogenic cores are perpendicular to the layers and, within a layer, packed on a 2 D hexagonal lattice. The polymeric backbones are confined between the layers of mesogenic cores, in a width of 6 ± 1 Å along the director. We discuss this structure in relation to those of the crystals that some polymers of the same series display and then to those of the classical SB phases : from the first point of view, it appears that the polymeric S B phase may be regarded as a 2 dimensional « paracrystal ». From the second one, the lack of a true monocrystal of the polymeric SB phase prevents us from definitely identifying it as a stacked hexatic phase. We have then investigated the fluctuations which affect the structure of this polymeric SB phase. As in classical SB phases, the mesogenic cores within a layer, pack themselves locally on a 2 -dimensional <b>herring</b> <b>bone</b> array of cohérence length of the order of 20 Å. Moreover, in the polymeric SB phase, this short range order is also correlated along a few adjacent layers by the polymeric backbones. In addition, the polymeric nature of the compound induces a transverse probably displacive local modulation of the layers (undulations). Its cohérence length is also roughly 20 Å. This modulation is strongly coupled to the 2 -dimensional hexagonal lattice and might also be coupled to the <b>herring</b> <b>bone</b> array. Longitudinal motions of the mesogenic cores about their mean positions in the layers have been detected too. Some of these motions are usually seen in the classical SB phases whereas the others are more complicated and difficult to represent in direct space. We briefly analyse them in terms of transverse displacive waves similar to phonons...|$|R

On {{the basis of this}} study and in combination with the observation in radio emission, an interpretation of the mechanism of the occurrence of this event has been proposed. The type II solar radio burst with a split and <b>herring</b> <b>bone</b> is occurring at the same time from 36 MHz till 50 MHz. We have noted that an individual type III burst also can be observed at 13 : 23 UT from 45 - 50 MHz. During that day, a stream of solar wind from a coronal hole on the Sun has disturbing Earth's magnetosphere creating a minor geomagnetic storm, G 1 on the NOAA scale of G 1 -G 5. In this case, the solar flare is not very high, but CME is responsible to form a solar radio burst type II. Overall, based on seven days observation beginning from 25 th March 2013, the solar activity is considered as very low. The highest solar flare can be observed within 7 days is only a class of B 8 flare. There was no CMEs event that directed to the Earth is detected. The geomagnetic field activities are also at minimum level. Although the solar flare event is at a lower stage, it is still possible to form the solar radio burst type II which is associated with CME event. From the selected event, although theoretically solar radio burst type II is associated with CMEs, there is no compelling solar radio burst type II without a flare. The onl...|$|R

40|$|A part of {{this thesis}} {{has been devoted to}} present general {{recuperator}} technology such as available gas turbine recuperator types, applications where recuperators are utilized, recuperator materials etc. An investigation of some compact and highly efficient heat transfer surfaces, for intended use in gas turbine recuperators, include the following surfaces: · Cross Wavy (CW) primary surface. · Corrugated Undulated (CU) primary surface. The CU surface is a relatively new surface which is projected for use in air preheaters · Cross Corrugated (CC) primary surface. The CC surface is familiar from the process industry (often called chevron type or <b>herring</b> <b>bone</b> pattern) but is so far not used in any commercially available gas turbine recuperator · A plate-fin type configuration, called the off-set strip fin is. The method of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been used for prediction of thermal performance and pressure losses of the CU and CW surfaces above. In this thesis a specific variant of the CW surface has been considered, called the Trapezoidal Cross Wavy (TCW) surface. This surface may be used in applications having larger hydraulic diameter than the small dimensions used in modern gas turbine recuperators. Design calculations of a recuperator heat transfer matrix were performed using configurations of the above surface types for a specific 50 kW microturbine. In these calculations the hydraulic diameter is equal for all configurations enabling comparison of the thermal and hydraulic performances of the surfaces. The results are presented as heat transfer matrix volumes and weights. The CC surface configurations give the smallest volume and weights of the heat transfer matrix for the specific microturbine recuperator. The straight corrugations of the CC surface should also be easier to fabricate by a stamping, pressing or folding process. It is concluded that the CC surface has potential to give a smaller volume and weight of a recuperator than any commercially available unit today...|$|R
40|$|Background: Fibromatosis {{includes}} {{a variety of}} fibroblastic proliferation whose biological trend and histopathological patterns are at intermediate level between benign fibroblastic lesions and fibrosarcoma. Accordingly, because of overlapping of histopathologic features of fibrosarcoma, particularly low-grade type, with fibromatosis, {{the present study was}} conducted to find more precise criteria for histopathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) differentiation of these lesions. Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive analytical study, a total of 40 specimens from pathology department archives in hospitals of Isfahan and Tehran universities from 2003 to 2013, including 20 fibrosarcoma and 20 fibromatosis biopsies, were selected. First, histopathologic characteristics were identified using H&E slides and an optical microscope H&E slides and then they were stained through immunohistochemical staining technique using the EnVision for markers Ki- 67 and β-catenin. Afterward the samples were examined by optical microscope and positively stained cells were counted. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} fibromatosis and fibrosarcoma in terms of a mean age (P= 0. 063), distribution of gender frequency (P= 0. 197), necrotic rate (P= 0. 602), clarity of nucleolus (P= 0. 799) and SID mean of β-catenin marker (0. 369). However, it was seen a meaningful difference between fibromatosis and fibrosarcoma in terms of frequency distribution (P= 0. 017), rate of mitotic figures (P< 0. 001), rate of herring-bone pattern (P= 0. 043), rate of cellularity (P< 0. 001), rate of nucleus overlapping (P< 0. 001), mean of Ki- 67 (P= 0. 046), mean of Ki- 67 -limit (P= 0. 001) and atypia rate (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: There was a meaningful difference between fibrosarcoma and fibromatosis in terms of mitotic figures, expression of Ki- 67 mitotic marker, <b>herring</b> <b>bone</b> pattern, cellularity and atypia.

The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of both the 70 -kDa (NPIMA(M) ETTS(M) DSKVNPLL) and the 22 -kDa (NQDMAMEASSDPEAA) fish phosphoproteins indicate that these unique amino acid sequences are unlike any published in protein databases. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that the 70 -kDa phosphoprotein was present principally in bone and in calcified scales, whereas the 22 -kDa phosphoprotein was detected only in bone. Immunohistological analysis revealed diffusely positive immunostaining for both the 70 - and 22 -kDa phosphoproteins throughout the matrix of the bone. Overall, this work adds additional support to the concept that the mechanism of biological calcification has common evolutionary and fundamental bases throughout vertebrate species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{describes}} the design, fabrication {{and operation of}} a microfluidic device for the screening of biomolecule mixture surface mediated effects. The characterisation of a surface immobilisation strategy {{that will allow the}} robust attachment of candidate biomolecules on a substrate for use in cell culture applications. This is carried out {{in the form of a}} modified and optimised layer-by-layer surface immobilisation strategy and its subsequent thorough and robust characterisation. This was achieved by compiling and critically analysing large amounts of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) data and the model utilised to provide meaningful, physical data as an output. QCM-D data was combined with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data to validate the assumptions used within the QCM-D model package. Further evidence demonstrating the presence of the multilayer, as described by QCM-D and SPR, is achieved using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These results show that the multilayer surface is robustly attached to the substrate and consists of a large amount of water whilst being able to immobilise mixtures of four proteins. A custom protocol for fabricating these two layer devices was devised and is presented. Scale limitations have been overcome to provide mixing capabilities for large extracellular matrix molecules to be immobilised on the previously described, microfluidically generated surface immobilisation strategy. The optimisation and characterisation of the mixing within this microfluidic device, affected by the incorporated staggered <b>herring</b> <b>bone</b> mixer is also shown. Using dynamic force spectroscopy (DFS) along with a custom designed force curve data processing and analysis package, the spatial localisation of a mixture of four immobilised biomolecules was determined. The aim of this study was to compare the spatial localization of a mixture of four biomolecules created by; standard cell culture protocols (adsorbed from bulk onto tissue culture polystyrene) and a surface created via microfluidic deposition on top of a previously described surface immobilisation strategy. The design and robust application of this custom analysis package allows the definition of a “Barricade of Specificity” such that interactions between an antibody functionalised AFM tip and a surface composed of a mixture of proteins, to be categorised as either a “true” specific interaction, or a non-specific interaction. The application of this Barricade of Specificity thus allows the spatial localisation of four immobilized biomolecules to be determined with a large degree of accuracy as a result of the large rage of non-specific interactions surveyed and the strict definition of a valid rupture force. The final chapter details the application of the microfluidic platform to enable high throughput screening of the effects of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, singly and in combination, with regards to the effect on the expression of cell surface markers on umbilical cord blood (UCB) derived CD 34 + cells. Careful selection of candidate ECM molecules, cytokine and oxygen concentration has resulted in little difference in the effect on UCB derived CD 34 + cells differentiation state after seven days in culture. The major effect has been the maturation towards lymphocyte and leukocyte precursors. However, of the four ECM molecules tested individually, in binary and in quaternary combinations, osteopontin (Opn) and laminin (Ln) demonstrated differences compared to other surfaces tested. In order to further assess the effect of these protein surfaces on the cell surface marker expression of UCB derived CD 34 + cells, further tests are warranted for increased periods of time to enable greater discrimination in marker expression and thus increase our understanding of the fundamental biology of this rare and clinically useful cell source...|$|R
40|$|Direct Metal Laser Sintering has {{attracted}} much attention {{over the last decade}} for producing complex parts additively based on digital models. The capability and reliability of this process has stimulated new design concepts and has widened the manufacturing perspective of product customisation. This research work is designed to gain a deep understanding of laser sintering processing parameters, the corresponding microstructures and the mechanical properties. The main purpose is to have a body of fundamental knowledge about the laser and titanium powder material interactions, thus establishing the factors that influence the process-structure-properties relationships of the Direct Metal Laser Sintering process. Finally, a route for manufacturing customised craniofacial implants was described. This is to evaluate the DMLS processing capabilities in medical areas, particularly those parts having porous and lattice design structures. The interaction between a laser beam and the powder bed creates a distinctive structure; a ball shaped (blob) consists of solid and porous regions. All the blobs have the same shape and morphology which may well suggest that there is a tendency for the powder particles to form a spherical droplet prior to a movingless laser beam. Surrounding the melted core is a sintered region of partially melted powder particles where the powder particles were fused together to form inter-particle necks. There is a linear relation between size, weight and density of a blob and the laser power. The surface temperature obtained exceeds the melting and vaporization temperature of the titanium and this creates a hole on the top part of a blob {{as a result of a}} massive temperature rise. Laser power of 140 W gives a consistent structure and hardness in a blob. Metallographic analyses of a blob’s cross-section show an α+β structure with prior-beta grains. The morphology of the lamellar structure consisted of acicular needles with a basket-weave pattern. The pores were characterised as having flat and spherical features with the size ranging from 2 µm to 6 µm. The micro-porosity observed may be associated with shrinkage which occurs during solidification or with the presence of entrapped gases from the atmosphere or argon gas from the shrouding environment Laser power and scan speed are the two most crucial factor controlling the laser-powder interactions. Result shows that laser power is capable of widening the processing parameters particularly the scan speed. Increased laser power causes more powder to melt thus creating a bigger melt pool. Contrary to this, increasing the scan speed reduces the interaction time thus a smaller amount of powder melts. The right combination of these two parameters results in inducing an appropriate exposure time where continuously scanned tracks can be formed. Most of the parts were successfully built using a specific volume energy density of 50 Jmm⁻³, which was considered to be the optimum processing parameter for this research work. The ideal laser-material interaction time was calculated at 0. 0008 secs. The microstructural analysis revealed a fully lamellar structure with acicular morphology. XRD analysis confirmed the presence of α’ martensite, which explains the thermal history of a high isothermal condition and rapid cooling. The cross section of a solid part exhibited an acicular, needle-like structure with a <b>herring</b> <b>bone</b> pattern, parallel to building direction, due to directional solidification. The microstructure had a high tensile strength but with low ductility. It is also worth mentioning that a slight change in scan speed, with the intention of providing more energy density to the powder, may cause instability in the melt pool and cause deterioration in the mechanical properties. It is therefore confirmed that there is an upper limit and allowable processing window where a good balance of tensile strength and hardness in a DMLS part is achievable. A framework prior to an implant’s fabrication was established and the associated design and manufacturing software are reported. The processing route required software like MIMICS and MAGICS to manipulate the medical images and design data and equitable skills must be acquired to handle the machine in order to successfully fabricate the desired parts. Employing MAGICS new lattice function proved to be more efficient, saving time compared to a manual procedure, especially when dealing with large medical data manipulation. In conclusion, the proposed method from this study is capable of producing a customised part with the highest degree of design complexity compared with other conventional manufacturing methods. This has proved to be very suitable for manufacturing titanium medical implants, particularly craniofacial implants which require a customised and lightweight structure and at the same time still provide good mechanical propertie...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the historical and}} archaeological data for the consumption of herring and the gadid fishes (primarily cod, haddock, whiting, ling and hake) as stored fish cured by salting, drying and smoking. The thesis {{is divided into three}} parts, in the first part the historical evidence for developing fisheries, storage methods, marketing and consumption is discussed with an evaluation of the nutritional changes to the fish as a result of storage. In part two factors affecting fish bone preservation and recovery are presented and the authors own recording criteria. A new methodology is introduced using the documented data for portions and rations from monasteries and the forces, showing herring and the gadids by volume offish eaten compared with the number of bones counted. Distribution of body parts as evidence for stored and fresh fish in the large gadids, hitherto only used to show processing is adapted for application to the data sample which largely represents consumption. In part three the 20 sites comprising the data sample are described. Portion and body part methods are applied to the <b>herring</b> and gadid <b>bones</b> from these assemblages. In the majority of sites herring predominate by number of bones, by portion cod becomes the primary fish in many cases. Evidence for stored cod, ling and hake were found by body part distribution in many assemblages. The results of this study have shown that the archaeological data when expressed as a volume of fish supports the historical evidence for cod as the prime fish among these species, both as fresh and stored. Fish assemblages transcribed into portion from bone numbers present fish as a volume of food and often relegate herring, excessively favoured by bone numbers, into a subsidiary position...|$|R
