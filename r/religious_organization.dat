5|$|The {{conscription}} law of World War I {{provided for}} noncombatant service {{for members of}} a <b>religious</b> <b>organization</b> whose members were forbidden from participating in war of any form. This exemption effectively limited conscientious objector status {{to members of the}} historic peace churches: Mennonites (and other Anabaptist groups such as Hutterites), Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and Church of the Brethren. The law gave the President authority to assign such draftees to any noncombatant military role.|$|E

In a third report on August 17, shortly after the church's most significant holiday, former member Moisés Padilla Íñiguez also accused Flores of sexually abusing him when he was a teenager. These accusations were spearheaded by Erdely's anti-cult group, which demanded that La Luz del Mundo be stripped of its legal recognition as a <b>religious</b> <b>organization.</b> Four people later filed formal complaints with the state prosecutor, but the statute of limitations for the alleged crimes had passed.|$|E

5|$|After this event, Vanille remains with Fang {{in crystal}} stasis within the pillar: from there, the two end up seeing {{everything}} that is going on, remaining unaffected by {{the changes in the}} timeline. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, though still held in the pillar, Vanille and Fang appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in. At the end of the game, they are rescued from the collapsing pillar. In Lightning Returns, Vanille has awoken from crystal stasis with Fang, gaining the ability to hear the voices of the dead. She is dubbed a saint and lives in the city of Luxerion in the protective care of the Order, a <b>religious</b> <b>organization</b> devoted to the deity Bhunivelze. Because of her ability, Vanille is key to a ritual to destroy the dead that will kill her in the process: not knowing the truth about the ritual, she decides to go through with it to atone for her past actions. On the final day, Lightning and Fang persuade Vanille to use her power to free the dead and enable them to be reborn.|$|E

40|$|Marketing {{communication}} {{is a vital}} strategic tool for <b>religious</b> <b>organizations</b> to achieve competitive differentiation. The determinants of religious organizations’ use of direct and indirect communication channels offers valuable insights into their modus operandi. This paper uses novel primary survey data on 568 Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh and Jain organizations spread over 7 major states in India that we collected over the period 2006 - 2008, to investigate the determinants of communication channel selection by <b>religious</b> <b>organizations.</b> The findings suggest that state-specific effects for Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal; and religion-specific fixed effects for Muslims play a predominant and persistent role in communication channel selection decisions. <b>Religious</b> <b>organizations</b> adopt direct channels more extensively to communicate changes to non-religious service provision. In a competitive framework, <b>religious</b> <b>organizations</b> also use indirect channels more extensively in response to information received about competitors. Additionally, intensive market competition leads <b>religious</b> <b>organizations</b> to increase their use of direct channels in response to information received about competitors through direct channels. Collectively, {{the findings suggest that}} across all religions in India, marketing communication plays a very important role for <b>religious</b> <b>organizations</b> {{in order for them to}} differentiate themselves from other competitors.

40|$|The {{breadth of}} {{activities}} and organizational forms among <b>religious</b> <b>organizations</b> rivals that of nonprofits generally, and <b>religious</b> <b>organizations</b> are vulnerable to {{the same types of}} problems that justify state regulation and oversight of nonprofits. Such problems include excessive compensation, improper benefits for board members and other insiders, misleading or fraudulent fundraising, employment discrimination, unsafe working conditions, consumer fraud, improper debt collection, and many others. <b>Religious</b> <b>organizations</b> are different, however, in that under federal and state law they enjoy unique protections from state regulation. This paper describes how such federal and state protections limit state regulation of <b>religious</b> <b>organizations</b> under current case law. It also explores the tension between the general ability of states to apply neutral and generally applicable laws to religiously motivated conduct and the special legal protections provided for some internal actions of <b>religious</b> <b>organizations</b> — particularly employment actions relating to ministers and certain internal disputes. It concludes by exploring how courts are likely to develop such limits in the future...|$|R
