40|$|Summary. [...] Experiments {{were carried}} out {{in order to measure}} the effect of the tension waves which are induced in an arresting gear rope system after engagement, and to try out means of suppressing these waves with a view to {{application}} to projected arresting gears suitable, for entry speeds of up to 120 and 150 knots. <b>Rope</b> <b>tensions</b> were recorded for a series of tests covering a range of entry speeds up to 117 knots with a test vehicle weight of 5, 400 lb. and up to 151 knots at a weight of 2, 450 lb. It is shown that the amplitude of the tension waves becomes relatively greater with increase of entry speed and reaches very serious proportions at the maximum speeds obtained. The use of resilient rope anchorages has resulted in the suppression of the tension waves to a large extent, reductions in peak tensions of up to 30 per cent under some conditions having been achieved. 1. Introduction. [...] Theoretical investigation 1, together with limited experimental evidence 2, has shown that tension waves are induced in an arresting gear rope immediately following engagement and that these waves may be multiplied by reflection. This results in instantaneous <b>rope</b> <b>tensions</b> considerably greater than is indicated by the standard method of estimating arresting gear characteristics in which an inextensible rope is assumed. The amplitude of these tension wave...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{important}} for safety reasons {{to mention that the}} rope used for the mechanics should be smaller in diameter than the <b>tension</b> <b>rope.</b> This allows for movement but when a large amount of tension is applied to the mechanical rope, friction is created between the two ropes allowing the friction knot to lock on to the <b>tension</b> <b>rope.</b> If two identical ropes of the same diameter are used for the friction knot and <b>tension</b> <b>rope,</b> the knot may move freely like a slip knot (lasso or noose) and not lock into place. When encircling any cylindrical object, most ropes can only be tightened to a diameter slightly greater than the ropes own diameter(USMC Assault Climber Course).|$|R

A third ring (the bottom ring) is placed around the stem. The rings are {{commonly}} made from 6–8mm (¼–⅓in) rebar. A series of cow hitches on the crown ring and bottom ring form loops. Through these loops, a length of rope connects the crown ring and the bottom ring; tightening this <b>rope</b> applies <b>tension.</b> As the vertical <b>rope</b> is <b>tensioned,</b> the cow hitches on the crown ring press the skin against the flesh ring below; this attaches the skin to the flesh ring very securely and stretches the skin over the bearing edge of the drum.|$|R

50|$|To {{maintain}} safe operation, the chairlift's {{control system}} monitors sensors and controls system parameters. Expected variances are compensated for; out-of-limit and dangerous conditions cause system shutdown. In the unusual instance of system shutdown, inspection by technicians, repair or evacuation might be needed. Both fixed and detachable lifts have sensors to monitor rope speed {{and hold it}} within established limits for each defined system operating speed. Also, the minimum and maximum <b>rope</b> <b>tension,</b> and speed feedback redundancy are monitored.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{it is not}} {{possible}} to achieve the optimum fleet angle. Where there is no space to rig a sheave the requisite distance from the drum, two additional spooling devices are available. One is a fleet angle compensator, which is driven automatically by the <b>rope</b> <b>tension.</b> The other is a level winder that is mechanically driven. Both offer a solution to guide the cable along the drum between flanges, but each has its advantages and disadvantages.|$|E
5000|$|In each case, cables are {{attached}} to a hitch plate {{on top of the}} cab or may be [...] "underslung" [...] below a cab, and then looped over the drive sheave to a counterweight attached to {{the opposite end of the}} cables which reduces the amount of power needed to move the cab. The counterweight is located in the hoist-way and rides a separate railway system; as the car goes up, the counterweight goes down, and vice versa. This action is powered by the traction machine which is directed by the controller, typically a relay logic or computerized device that directs starting, acceleration, deceleration and stopping of the elevator cab. The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40-50% of the capacity of the elevator. The grooves in the drive sheave are specially designed to prevent the cables from slipping. [...] "Traction" [...] is provided to the ropes by the grip of the grooves in the sheave, thereby the name. As the ropes age and the traction grooves wear, some traction is lost and the ropes must be replaced and the sheave repaired or replaced. Sheave and rope wear may be significantly reduced by ensuring that all ropes have equal tension, thus sharing the load evenly. <b>Rope</b> <b>tension</b> equalization may be achieved using a <b>rope</b> <b>tension</b> gauge, and is a simple way to extend the lifetime of the sheaves and ropes.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{estimate}} {{influence of}} elastic deformations {{of the track}} cable arising at movement of cars, on effort in a hauling rope of the aerial ropeway. Methodology. The method of consecutive approaches was used for research influence of elastic deformations of a track cable on effort in a hauling rope. Thus, definition of a tension of a track cable was carried out with use of the technique based on principles of modular configuration, the essence of which consists in formation of mathematical model {{by a combination of}} blocks of the formulas describing balance of the track cable on supports. Findings. The research has shown that influence of elastic deformations of a track cable on effort in a hauling rope was insignificant (less than 1 %). That points to possibility not to consider change of the track cable length, caused by its elastic properties, when modeling loading of elements of system «drive – traction <b>rope</b> – <b>tension</b> device». Also it has been found that use of the tension device of a track cable increased influence of its elastic properties on loading of rope system elements. At the same time the elastic component of the track cable tension in the test flight does not depend on a car position in the adjacent span, but only determines by the parameters of the rope system. Originality. The possibility of excluding the changes of track cable length caused by its elastic properties, when modeling loading of elements of system «drive – traction <b>rope</b> – <b>tension</b> device» was proved. Practical value. The use of these techniques and the results will simplify the mathematical model of loading of elements of the cable system and the system «drive – traction <b>rope</b> – <b>tension</b> device» as a whole...|$|R
50|$|A torque {{amplifier}} is essentially two capstans connected together. A capstan {{consists of a}} drum that is connected to a powerful rotary source, typically the steam engine of the ship, or an electric motor in modern examples. To use the device, a rope is wound around the drum, with one end attached to a load, and the other hand-held by the user. Initially the <b>rope</b> has little <b>tension</b> and slips easily as the drum turns. However, if the user pulls on their end of the <b>rope,</b> the <b>tension</b> increases, gripping the drum. Now the entire torque of the driver {{is applied to the}} other end of the rope, pulling the load. If the user does nothing, the capstan will pull the load toward them, loosening the rope and stopping further motion. If the user instead takes up the slack, the tension is maintained and the load continues to be pulled. In this way, the user can easily control the motion of a very large load.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} keep pace with the modern oil {{transport}} trends, the Indian ports are also developing terminal facilities for Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC). A conceptual design methodology for marine oil terminal (MOT) including mooring system for large oil tankers has been evolved. The orientation of the MOT and mooring arrangements for 200000 DWT oil tanker were determined considering the environmental conditions prevailed at the site. Water flow velocity played an important role in the orientation of the MOT. Quick Fender Selection Method (QFSM) has been considered for the selection of fender system and it was found that supercone fenders of 2 m height or equivalent type of fenders were suitable for the oil tanker. The mooring arrangements comprising of steel ropes with nylon tails, sustained the effect of high winds of 60 knots associated with currents and waves. Finally, simulation of moored ship motions for moderate environmental conditions i. e., wind speed of 30 knots, current speed of 4 knots and 1 m wave height was carried out using quasi-static approach. The ship motions in six degrees of freedom were found within the permissible limit for safe cargo handling operation.
