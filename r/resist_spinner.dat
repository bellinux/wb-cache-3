40|$|Sensing {{elements}} of the Optical Moisture Sensor presented here consist of rutile structured one to four layered Titania thin films deposited {{on the base of}} an isosceles glass prism by using a Photo <b>Resist</b> <b>Spinner.</b> These films are annealed at 450 ËšC for four hours and then they become porous and sensitive to moisture. Light from an unpolarised 2 mW He-Ne Laser of wavelength 630 nm enters the prism from one of its isosceles faces and gets reflected from the glass-film interface at its base. The reflected light emerging out from the other isosceles face of the prism is collected through an optical fibre and fed into an optical power meter for measurement. Variations in the intensity of light caused by changes in humidity lying in the range 5 % RH to 95 %RH have been recorded. A proper configuration with two layered Titania film for such a sensor yields high sensitivity for it over the entire range of humidity...|$|E
