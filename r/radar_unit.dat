5|$|On 24 March 1942, it was {{requested}} that PLC be {{occupied by the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{for the purpose of}} establishing a top secret <b>Radar</b> <b>Unit</b> and military barracks known as No.1 RIMU (Radio Installation and Maintenance Unit). PLC's displaced boarders, and some of the classrooms, found a temporary home at Meriden School in Strathfield. The school purchased Lingwood, also in Strathfield, as a centre for the school's remaining activities.|$|E
5|$|The cockpit was {{significantly}} altered for the Comet 4's introduction, on which an improved layout {{focusing on the}} onboard navigational suite was introduced. An EKCO E160 <b>radar</b> <b>unit</b> was installed in the Comet 4's nose cone, providing search functions as well as ground and cloud mapping capabilities, and a radar interface was built into the Comet 4 cockpit along with redesigned instruments.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like <b>radar</b> <b>unit</b> with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E

5|$|Like the US AH-64D Apache Longbow, the Apache AH1 {{carries a}} fire-control radar (FCR) and Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), {{providing}} an integrated surveillance and attack system. The 'Longbow’ radar is the bulbous unit over the rotor hub assembly; radar placement above the rotors allows the Apache to hover behind cover scanning for targets, {{with only the}} <b>radar</b> <b>unit</b> exposed. Additionally, the Longbow radar can monitor traffic in the Apache's airspace. The radar {{can also be used}} for surveillance and terrain profiling. A modem is interfaced into the Longbow radar and other sensor systems to relay information to other aircraft, this allows other Apaches to fire on targets identified by only a single helicopter.|$|E
5|$|A modest force {{remained}} in Afghanistan over {{this time and}} was involved in counter-insurgency operations in Uruzgan Province in conjunction United States and other coalition forces, including the Dutch prior to their withdrawal. The force consisted of motorised infantry, special forces, engineers, cavalry, artillery and aviation elements. By 2010 it included a combined arms battalion-sized battle group known as the Mentoring Task Force, and the Special Operations Task Group, both based at Forward Operation Base Ripley outside of Tarin Kowt, {{as well as the}} Rotary Wing Group flying CH-47D Chinooks, the Force Logistics Asset and an RAAF air surveillance <b>radar</b> <b>unit</b> based in Kandahar. In addition, a further 800 Australian logistic personnel were also based in the Middle East in support, but are located outside of Afghanistan. Meanwhile, detachments of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, based out of Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates. Also included is the deployment of one of the RAN's frigates to the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden on counter piracy and maritime interdiction duties.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{air defense}} missile battery {{consists}} of a <b>radar</b> <b>unit,</b> missile control unit, and several launchers, all located at the same site.|$|E
5|$|While in drydock in July 1943, a Type 21 air {{search radar}} was {{installed}} {{on the roof of}} the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. In August 1944, two Type 22 surface search <b>radar</b> <b>units</b> were {{installed on the}} pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning <b>radar</b> <b>units</b> were fitted on her mainmast.|$|R
50|$|Würzburg <b>radar</b> <b>units,</b> {{priority}} {{targets for}} the Allies, were disguised where possible. The smaller Freya radar was less visible. However both would suffer damage from bombing and bombardment so the crews worked from inside bunkers. The two Würzburg and two Freya <b>radar</b> <b>units</b> at Fort George, Guernsey, were repeatedly attacked {{from the end of}} May 1944 on.|$|R
5000|$|Lebanon sent <b>radar</b> <b>units</b> to Syria for air defense. Lebanon however did {{not take}} part in the war.|$|R
25|$|The wing was {{assigned}} an additional Air Defense Group in September 1954 when the 4700th Air Base Group at Stewart Air Force Base, New York {{was assigned}} an operational fighter squadron and redesignated the 4700th Air Defense Group. The 4707th was also assigned an additional <b>radar</b> <b>unit</b> two months later.|$|E
25|$|Reconnaissance parties {{landed on}} Woodlark and Kiriwina in May and {{reported}} {{that there were no}} Japanese troops occupying the islands. Due to a delay in gathering the units assigned to the operation together, as they were spread across the north of Australia and New Guinea D-Day was set for 30 June 1943. A RAAF LW-AW <b>radar</b> <b>unit,</b> No. 305 Radar Station arrived at Kiriwina Island on 17 May and was operational the next day, providing advance warning of airborne threats.|$|E
25|$|It {{was created}} by Oerlikon-Buehrle. The weapon was {{introduced}} in the 1960s in the Swiss Army and got updates in 1975, 1995 and 2010. They are still in use. It had replaced the system Contraves Super Fledermaus in the Swiss Air Force. The Skyguard radar system was used in the German Air Force for surveillance of low-altitude flight zones. The <b>radar</b> <b>unit</b> is readied quickly through the use of hydraulic systems for antenna erection and leveling after deployment. A typical fire unit using the Skyguard consists of two twin 35mm gun platforms with a single Skyguard fire control radar.|$|E

25|$|To enforce speed limits, two {{approaches}} are generally employed. In the United States, {{it is common}} for the police to patrol the streets and use special equipment (typically a <b>radar</b> <b>unit)</b> to measure the speed of vehicles, and pull over any vehicle found to be in violation of the speed limit. In Brazil, Colombia and some European countries, there are computerized speed-measuring devices spread throughout the city, which will automatically detect speeding drivers and take a photograph of the license plate (or number plate), which is later used for applying and mailing the ticket. Many jurisdictions in the U.S. use this technology as well.|$|E
25|$|In April 1940, Popular Science {{showed an}} example of a <b>radar</b> <b>unit</b> using the Watson-Watt patent in an article on air defence. Also, in late 1941 Popular Mechanics had an article in which a U.S. {{scientist}} speculated about the British early warning system on the English east coast and came close to what it was and how it worked. Watson-Watt was sent to the U.S. in 1941 to advise on air defense after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. Alfred Lee Loomis organized the Radiation Laboratory at Cambridge, Massachusetts which developed the technology in the years 1941–45. Later, in 1943, Page greatly improved radar with the monopulse technique that was used for many years in most radar applications.|$|E
25|$|In theory, {{electricity}} from nuclear reactors {{could also be}} used for propulsion in space, but this has yet to be demonstrated in a space flight. Some smaller reactors, such as the TOPAZ nuclear reactor, are built to minimize moving parts, and use methods that convert nuclear energy to electricity more directly, making them useful for space missions, but this electricity has historically been used for other purposes. Power from nuclear fission has been used in a number of spacecraft, all of them unmanned. The Soviets up to 1988 orbited 33 nuclear reactors in RORSAT military radar satellites, where electric power generated was used to power a <b>radar</b> <b>unit</b> that located ships on the Earth's oceans. The U.S. also orbited one experimental nuclear reactor in 1965, in the SNAP-10A mission. No nuclear reactor has been sent into space since 1988.|$|E

25|$|The {{solution}} was to choose a single frequency {{for all of the}} IFF transponders to operate on, no matter what the radar system's natural frequency might be. The selected frequency was 180MHz, a little under the lowest of the existing 1.5m radars. The transponder radio was tuned only to this frequency, not the radar itself. The radar system also added a separate radio system for transmitting and receiving these pulses, the interrogator. When the radar operator pressed a button on their console, the interrogator began sending out pulses synchronised with those of the <b>radar</b> <b>unit.</b> The IFF unit in the target aircraft then responded with pulses with the same timing. The output of the interrogator's receiver was mixed with the radar's, causing the blip to extend as before. When this was added to the spiral scan display, instead of stretching the blip, the IFF signal appeared as a series of short line segments extending outward {{from the middle of the}} display, the sunrise pattern.|$|E
25|$|Japanese naval {{bombers and}} fighters took off {{according}} to their revised schedule and approached Luzon in two well-separated forces, {{both of which were}} detected by the Iba radar detachment just before 11:30am. Despite an hour's warning, only the P-40 squadron at Iba took off, and it ran low on fuel in futile response to confusing instructions from the 24th PG that resulted from changing analyses of Japanese intents. The Iba P-40s were in their landing pattern when the Japanese struck. The aircraft at Clark and Iba were caught on the ground when the attack began at 12:35pm. One hundred and seven two-engined bombers divided into two equal forces bombed the airfields first, after which 90 Zero fighters conducted strafing attacks until 1:25pm (the fighters strafing Iba concluded at 1:05pm, after which they flew to Clark and resumed attacks). Nearly the entire B-17 force at Clark, one-third of the U.S. fighters and its only operational <b>radar</b> <b>unit</b> were destroyed. The Japanese lost only seven fighters and a single bomber to combat.|$|E
25|$|Business records exception: {{business}} records created during the {{ordinary course of business}} are considered reliable and {{can usually be}} brought in under this exception if the proper foundation is laid when the records are introduced into evidence. Depending on which jurisdiction the case is in, either the records custodian or someone with knowledge of the records must lay a foundation for the records, however. The use of police records, especially as substantive evidence against the accused in a criminal trial, is severely restricted under the Business Records exception. Typically, only generalized evidence about police procedure is admissible under this exception, and not facts about a specific case. For example, John is stopped for speeding 70 miles per hour in a 50-mile-per-hour zone. The officer, who determined John's speed with radar, records the speed in an incident report. He also calibrates and runs a diagnostic on his radar every day prior to beginning his shift. He records this in a log. At trial, the report itself would not be admissible as it pertained to the facts of the case. However, the officer's daily log in which he records his calibration and the daily diagnostics of his <b>radar</b> <b>unit</b> would be admissible under the {{business records}} exception.|$|E

25|$|Lovell {{continued}} {{his work on}} the production antenna design using klystrons and wrapped up this work on 22 July. The team then began adapting the various bits of equipment to work together as a single <b>radar</b> <b>unit</b> based on the magnetron. J. R. Atkinson and W. E. Burcham, both sent to the AIS team from the Cavendish Laboratory at University of Cambridge, produced a pulsed power source, and Skinner and A. G. Ward, also from Cavendish, worked on a receiver. At the time the team had no solution to switching the antenna from transmit to receive, so they initially used two antennas side-by-side, one on the transmitter and one on the receiver. On 8 August they were experimenting with this setup when they received a signal from a nearby fishing hut. With the antenna still pointed in the same direction, they accidentally detected an aircraft which flew by the site at 6pm on 12 August. The next day, Dee, Watt and Rowe were on hand, but with no convenient aircraft available the team instead demonstrated the system by detecting the returns from a tin sheet being held by someone bicycling across a nearby cliff. With this demonstration of the radar's ability to reject ground returns and detect targets at basically zero altitude, interest in the 1.5m systems began to wane.|$|E

500|$|I-29s {{floatplane}} made a reconnaissance flight over Sydney on 23 May. A secret <b>radar</b> <b>unit</b> {{set up in}} Iron Cove {{detected the}} flight, but authorities dismissed its report as a glitch, as there were no Allied aircraft operating over Sydney. [...] The aircraft was damaged or destroyed on landing, although its two crew survived. They reported the presence of several capital ships, including two battleships or large cruisers, five other large warships, several minor war vessels and patrol boats, and prolific merchant shipping. The report, which the Allied FRUMEL signals intelligence network partially intercepted, resulted in the Japanese Navy selecting Sydney as the target.
