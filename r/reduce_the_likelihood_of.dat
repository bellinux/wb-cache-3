5|$|Ballas and {{carbonado}} diamond are exceptional, as {{they are}} polycrystalline and therefore much tougher than single-crystal diamond; they are used for deep-drilling bits and other demanding industrial applications. Particular faceting shapes of diamonds {{are more prone to}} breakage and thus may be uninsurable by reputable insurance companies. The brilliant cut of gemstones is designed specifically to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> breakage or splintering.|$|E
5|$|The fact that, in a digitally-connected world, {{a modern}} {{aircraft}} could disappear {{was met with}} surprise and disbelief by the public. While changes in the aviation industry often take years to be implemented, airlines and air transport authorities responded swiftly to take action on several measures to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> a similar incident.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{suggests}} that the Allied ships were heavier and, by implication, less maneuverable. Their weight would further <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> the Allied ships employing the diekplous. The source of this heaviness is uncertain; possibly the Allied ships were bulkier in construction. Another suggestion is that the heaviness {{was caused by the}} weight of fully armoured hoplite marines. The Allies may have had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier). Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships, rather than sinking them.|$|E

5|$|The party's ski boots, {{specially}} designed by Amundsen, were {{the product of}} two years' testing and modification in search of perfection. The party's polar clothing included suits of sealskin from Northern Greenland, and clothes fashioned after {{the style of the}} Netsilik Inuit from reindeer skins, wolf skin, Burberry cloth and gabardine. The sledges were constructed from Norwegian ash with steel-shod runners made from American hickory. Skis, also fashioned from hickory, were extra long to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> slipping into crevasses. The tents—"the strongest and most practical that have ever been used"—had built-in floors and required a single pole. For cooking on the march, Amundsen chose the Swedish Primus stove rather than the special cooker devised by Nansen, because he felt the latter took up too much space.|$|E
5|$|Female copper sharks {{make use}} of shallow inshore habitats, varying from {{stretches}} of open coast to more sheltered bays and inlets, as nurseries. These nurseries provide abundant food and <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> predation by larger members of the species. Known and suspected nursery areas occur off northern North Island from Waimea Inlet to Hawke Bay for New Zealand sharks, off Albany, in and around Gulf St Vincent, and in Port Phillip Bay for Australian sharks, off Niigata (Japan) for northwestern Pacific sharks, off the Eastern Cape for South Africa sharks, off Rhodes (Greece), Nice (France), and Al Hoceima (Morocco) for Mediterranean sharks, off Río de Oro (Western Sahara) for northwest African sharks, off Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Buenos Aires and Bahía Blanca (Argentina) for southwestern Atlantic sharks, and off Paita and Guanape Cove (Peru), in Sebastián Vizcaíno Bay (Mexico), and in and around San Diego Bay for eastern Pacific sharks.|$|E
5|$|To <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> {{damage to}} the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel tanks are located near the aircraft's center and are {{separated}} from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's self-sealing capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both {{the inner and outer}} sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing sump tanks contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the determinants {{and consequences of}} delay in the union certification process using data from certification applications and unfair labor practice complaints (ULPs) from British Columbia (1986 - 98) and Ontario (1993 - 98). During the period studied, there were several changes in delay-related laws, including laws regulating the presence and stringency of election time limits {{and the availability of}} expedited ULP hearings. Key findings are that ULPs against <b>the</b> employer <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> compliance with time limit laws except where expedited ULP hearings also existed; employer-filed objections to <b>the</b> application <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> compliance; and election delay <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> certification success both in policy regimes without time limits and in those where stipulated time limits were frequently breached. Overall, the results suggest that enforced time limits on elections coupled with expedited ULP hearings may substantially mitigate the adverse effects of election delay on certification success...|$|R
