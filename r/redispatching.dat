40|$|Grid {{congestion}} management is gaining importance {{in certain parts}} of the European electricity grid. The deployment of renewable electricity sources at locations with a weak grid connection and far from the load centers can lead to overloading of transmission lines. <b>Redispatching,</b> i. e., rearranging scheduled generation and consumption, might be needed to obtain a feasible and safe operational state of the electricity system. This paper studies the impact of three parameters on the <b>redispatching</b> quantities and costs: (1) loop flows through the electricity system, (2) an increase in renewable generation in remote areas, and (3) a curative and preventive N- 1 security criterion. Towards this aim, a dedicated generation scheduling model is developed, consisting of a day-ahead market and a redispatch phase. The Belgian power system is considered as case study. Three general conclusions can be drawn from this paper. First, {{it is important to consider}} loop flows when quantifying <b>redispatching,</b> especially in a highly interconnected electricity system as the European system. The case study shows that loop flows can more than double the need for <b>redispatching.</b> Second, transmission grid constraints might restrict the deployment of renewables in certain areas. Third, relaxing the N- 1 security criterion in congested grid areas from preventive to curative can drastically reduce the redispatch costs. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} a {{model to}} analyze the impact of recent developments of the electricity market on the national high-voltage transmission network from an economic perspective is developed. The purpose is to design a tool that allows including the costs induced on the network into an economic assessment {{in order to obtain}} a complete economic picture. In order to allow a reasonable application to the German electricity system and respective inferences, the concept of cost-based <b>redispatch</b> for network congestion relief is modeled. Furthermore, the concept of PTDF matrixes is integrated into the linear dispatch model DIANA thereby modeling the physical characteristics of electricity transmission. The model is applied to the prospective development of the German electricity system by use of a scenario analysis. By this means, the development of <b>redispatch</b> costs and quantities in Germany in the prospective years are highlighted. It can be shown that despite investments in the transmission infrastructure, the costs and quantities of <b>redispatch</b> increase in the course of time. Although the magnitude of this increase varies from scenario to scenario, a general trend of increasing costs and quantities can be observed for all scenarios. Moreover, the foreseeable development of the electricity market makes network extensions indispensable. Such network extensions, however, should not only be evaluated from a technical perspective, but should also be judged economically. As shown, the developed model can be used for such an economic assessment of investments in the transmission infrastructure. Finally, the model results show that the current German market design of cost-based <b>redispatch</b> becomes insufficient for resolving congestion from a technical perspective. The use of dummy <b>redispatch</b> in the model herbey indicates a regional shortage of generation capacity available for <b>redispatch</b> (or the need to curtail demand). As a consequence, the results in this dissertation reveal the necessity to change the market design in the future (e. g. by introducing price regions or a capacity market for <b>redispatch)</b> in order to guarantee a secure and stable functioning of the electricity system. ...|$|R

Compared to 2011, our findings indicate a much more critical network situation in Germany for 2015. We identify increased RES production, resulting imports and exports, delays in grid extension and the impacts of the nuclear phase-out (leading to an amplified north-south congestion problem) as main drivers for the nearly doubling of <b>redispatch</b> volumes in 2015.

40|$|AbstractA medium-voltage AC {{network with}} {{distributed}} generation and storage devices is considered for which set points are assigned in each time {{period of a}} given time horizon. A set point in a time period is defined by modules and phases of voltages in all nodes, active and reactive powers, {{on load tap changer}} and variable loads. When some parameters vary, in order to restore feasibility new set points need to be determined so as to minimize the variations with respect to the initial ones. This can be done by minimizing distributor's <b>redispatching</b> costs, which are modeled by means of binary variables, while satisfying service security requirements and ensuring service quality, which are represented by nonlinear constraints, such as the nodal balance of active and reactive power and the current transits on lines and transformers for security. Storage devices are modeled by means of constraints that relate adjacent time periods. A two-step solution procedure is proposed, which is based on decoupling active and reactive variables: in the first step a MILP model determines the active power production and the use of storage devices that minimize <b>redispatching</b> costs over all time periods in the time horizon; in the second step, given the optimal active power production computed in the first step, reactive variables in each time period are computed by solving a nonlinear programming model...|$|E

Because the decision for the MW- dispatch / scheduling is requested to be very fast, the method proposed here brings the efficiency of computations by utilizing the existing practical approaches for obtaining the optimal solution. So, in this paper, a method of MW- <b>redispatching</b> by using {{the practical}} sensitivity-based technique, which is used for identifying the wheeling paths in overloaded states is proposed. By the proposed method, the MW-redispatching problem without using OPF solutions can be solved.

It is obvious that if wheeling paths from suppliers to customers could be identified appropriately, it becomes possible to set up the proper and fair wheeling rate according to the degree of power flow in each wheeling path.

40|$|Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) {{techniques}} are raising {{more and more}} interest {{in the context of}} the operation of high voltage transmission networks because they represent a new approach to the security assessment in power system operation. The classical deterministic methods, which compare the power system performance to a predefined set of requirements (e. g. no current and voltage violations, no stability problems), do not take into account the probability of occurrence and the magnitude of events and do not perform a quantitative characterization of the impact of the contingencies. The fulfillment of the security requirements also for the most critical contingencies determines large security margins, thus higher operational and planning costs. On the other hand the risk of other contingencies may be underestimated.

The paper briefly reviews the CM schemes and the associated pricing mechanism used by the IGOs in five representative schemes.

We develop a unified framework for the mathematical representation of the market dispatch and <b>redispatch</b> problems that the IGO must solve in CM in these various jurisdictions.
