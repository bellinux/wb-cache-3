Also that year, a mortally ill King Ferdinand made him a Grand Officer of the Order of the Star of Romania. Again touring Germany with a series of conferences (1926), Tzigara also spoke at Radio Berlin, making his debut in radio programming.

25|$|Iorga's {{theories}} on the Dacians and the Thracians {{were among the}} many elements synthesized into the nationalist current known as Protochronism, which claimed that the sources of Romanian identity were {{to be found in}} pre-Roman history, and was offered support by Ceaușescu's regime. His work was selectively reinterpreted by Protochronists such as Dan Zamfirescu, Mihai Ungheanu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor. Contrasting perspectives on Iorga's legacy were held by the various voices within the Romanian diaspora. On the 40th anniversary of his death, the Munich-based <b>Romanian</b> <b>section</b> of the anti-communist Radio Free Europe (RFE) broadcast an homage piece with renewed condemnation of Iorga's killers. RFE received death threats from obscure Iron Guard diaspora members, probably agents of the Securitate secret police.|$|E
