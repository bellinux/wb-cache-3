40|$|Faults tend {{to degrade}} the {{performance}} of HVAC systems by causing occupants' discomfort, increased energy consumption, and shorter life of equipment. Accordingly, {{it is very important}} to develop fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) tools for HVAC systems. In this thesis, in consideration of the fact that many faults could be traced back to oversized/undersized equipment, an interactive design tool is first developed to simulate the steady-state performance of a multi-zone variable-air-volume terminal reheat (VAV-TRH) HVAC system. This program is used for verifying HVAC system parameters to ensure that HVAC components are correctly sized. Then, a software program is developed to simulate the dynamic performance of a two-zone variable-air-volume terminal reheat (VAV-TRH) HVAC system. This program runs in two modes: off-line and on-line. Using this program, two control strategies [...] -an optimal control strategy and a <b>reheat</b> <b>control</b> strategy, are studied. Simulation results show that the optimal control strategy leads to more energy savings than the <b>reheat</b> <b>control</b> strategy and is valid most of the operation time. The program is also useful for on-line fault detection and diagnosis for the HVAC system. In order to achieve this goal, an expert rule set for on-line FDD is established using knowledge-based approach. The expert rule set, in which IF-THEN clauses are applied, consists of simple rules that can successfully identify some fairly obvious problems that are often overlooked. The simulation experiments are performed to examine {{the performance of}} expert rules using data from real-time simulations. Simulation results show that expert rules are efficient in on-line detection and diagnosis of HVAC faults...|$|E

A discrete Kalman filter (KF) is established to estimate the SDM parameters. A covariance control formulation is introduced to split the system closed-loop variance/covariance into two terms, one term to account for the minimum expected quadratic loss bound (equivalent to the minimum variance performance bound but in state space formulation), and another to account for performance deviations from the minimum variance bound. Simulation studies have been conducted on several nonlinear process systems including a cold rolling mill model with roll eccentricity and a steel making system with real time oxyfuel slab <b>reheating</b> furnace <b>control</b> data.

50|$|Thermal Stratification of {{the liquid}} portion of the {{pressurizer}}. When the liquid portion of the pressurizer becomes stratified, the lower layers of water (furthest from the steam bubble) are subcooled and as the steam bubble slowly condenses, pressurizer pressure will appear relatively constant but actually will be slowly lowering. When the operator energizes pressurizer heaters to maintain or raise pressure, pressure will continue to drop until the subcooled water is heated up by the pressurizer heaters to the saturation temperature corresponding to {{the pressure of the}} steam (bubble) portion of the pressurizer. During this <b>reheating</b> period, pressure <b>control</b> will be lost, since pressure will still be dropping when it is desired to raise pressure.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} heating rate to tension test {{temperature}} on superplastic response in an Al- 8 %Mg- 1 %Li- 0. 2 % Zr alloy was studied. A thermomechanical process (TMP) was used that involved warm rolling with <b>controlled</b> <b>reheating</b> between rolling passes. During the TMP, microstructural evolution {{was controlled by}} a continuous reaction (CRX). In this work, superplastic response was studied using five heating rates, ranging from 7. 1 X 10 - 3 C/s to 2. 4 x 10 + 1 C/s, following TMP. Heating rates greater than 10 C/s resulted in a discontinuous reaction (DRX) with a likely coarsening of grain size. Conversely, high ductilities and enhancement of superplasticity resulted from slower heating rates (1 deg C/s) that facilitated recovery and CRX in a microstructure already highly refined by CRX during the TMP.

Reduction of oxygen in vacuum bags extended the shelf life of the precooked ground beef patties, {{at least in terms}} of oxidative rancidity.

40|$|Nuclear reactor plants {{include a}} turbine {{generator}} system (TGS) {{to convert the}} energy in steam from the {{nuclear steam supply system}} into electrical energy. The TGS consists essentially of the turbine unit and the automatic devices, alarms, and trips which control and regulate turbine action, and the generator unit and its Con-trols. The turbine control system and the steam inlet stop and control valves, the low pressure turbine steam intercept and inlet control valves, and the extraction steam control valves control the speed of the turbine under normal and abnormal conditions, and are thus related to the overall safe operation of the plant. The turbine generator system installed in a nuclear plant is typically equipped with redundant overspeed protection instrumentation and controls and the main steam and <b>reheat</b> steam <b>control</b> and stop valving arrangements typically provide redundancy in the valves essential for overspeed protection. The intent of the review under this SRP section is to verify that such redundancy, in conjunction with inservice inspection and testing of the essential valves, makes a turbine overspeed condition above the design overspeed very unlikely and to assure conformance with General Design Criterion 4.

40|$|There is {{a general}} paucity of {{measured}} equipment load data for laboratories and other complex buildings and designers often use estimates based on nameplate rated data or design assumptions from prior projects. Consequently, peak equipment loads are frequently overestimated, and load variation across laboratory spaces within a building is typically underestimated. This results in two design flaws. Firstly, the overestimation of peak equipment loads results in over-sized HVAC systems, increasing initial construction costs as well as energy use due to inefficiencies at low part-load operation. Secondly, HVAC systems that are designed without accurately accounting for equipment load variation across zones can significantly increase simultaneous heating and cooling, particularly for systems that use zone <b>reheat</b> for temperature <b>control.</b> Thus, when designing a laboratory HVAC system, the use of measured equipment load data from a comparable laboratory will support right-sizing HVAC systems and optimizing their configuration to minimize simultaneous heating and cooling, saving initial construction costs as well as life-cycle energy costs. In this paper, we present data from recent studies to support the above thesis. We first present measured equipment load data from two sources: time-series measurements in several laboratory modules in a university research laboratory building; and peak load data for several facilities recorded in a national energy benchmarking database. We then contrast this measured data with estimated values that are typically used for sizing the HVAC systems in these facilities, highlighting the over-sizing problem. Next, we examine the load variation in the time series measurements and analyze {{the impact of this}} variation on energy use, via parametric energy simulations. We then briefly discuss HVAC design solutions that minimize simultaneous heating and cooling energy use...|$|R
40|$|Continuous Commissioning? (CC?) was {{performed}} on a 24, 446 square foot institutional building used primarily to house offices and conference rooms. The building was constructed in 1950, and then had a complete Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) retrofit in 2001 to include new equipment and Direct Digital Control (DDC). Following the retrofit, CC {{was carried out in}} this building, mainly implementing outside air temperature (OAT) based temperature and static pressure reset strategies. In 2008, a second round of CC {{was performed}} (and is still in progress), which has focused on incorporating demand based reset strategies in addition to the reset strategies already in place. This paper examines the advantages of demand based reset strategies used in conjunction with outside air based reset strategies, with this building serving as a case study. In a more general sense, the building also serves as a case study of the benefits of performing multiple rounds of CC in a facility over time. Predicted energy savings from the second round of CC over the first round were reported. Since the second round of CC was still in progress as of completion of this paper, savings were predicted using simulation models developed in Energy Plus, a commercial simulation software package. Actual savings achieved from CC will be determined and presented in a 2 nd paper when sufficient post-CC data have been obtained. This paper also mentions two specific challenges that were encountered and addressed during the second round of CC, including: 1) control of terminal boxes with inline electric <b>reheat,</b> and 2) <b>control</b> of a constant speed multi-zone air handling unit with zone temperature control.

40|$|M. Tech. In life {{extending}} and refurbishing old {{power station}} plant, {{the following question}} must be addressed: Does one maintain current configuration, {{which was based on}} the technology of 1960, or make use of current power utility technology trends, and change the power station's configuration. This specific problem involves four existing Eskom power stations, with an approximate combined replacement value of R 7 billion. All these stations have the capability of using a common steam feed range to supply superheated steam to the turbo-generator sets. This common steam feed range becomes very maintenance intensive in its "old age". Hence the need for this study into the feasibility of its refurbishment. This common steam feed range configuration was considered state-of-the-art in the mid- 1900 's, but is currently not the practised technology. This is primarily due to the technology advancement into <b>reheat</b> boilers, making <b>control</b> of a range type configuration impossible. Monte Carlo simulation provides an effective, holistic decision mechanism, that is free from bias, emotions and conjecture. Hence the simulation product, highlighted in this dissertation, will have solved an industrial problem finally and effectively, by ensuring that for a relatively small cost of building the simulation models, major capital expenditure estimates can be accurate, with a confidence in the return on investment. This paper discusses the use of Monte Carlo simulation modelling as an engineering analysis tool, for the analysis of two power station configuration options, i. e. with a steam feed range and without. Firstly, an investigation into the selection of which computer language to use as a development tool is presented. The Monte Carlo simulation technique is then explained, and simulation models are built of the two power station configurations. The models, which are built using SIMSCRIPT 11. 5 simulation language to represent the real world in each configuration option, are then discussed. The availability analysis is developed, and conclusions and recommendations are discussed, as presented in the report to Eskom Management...|$|R
