30|$|Our {{paper is}} related to the studies shown in Table  1, but with some notable differences. Chu and Manchanda (2013) state that {{previous}} work often focused on the benefits (or costs) a user obtains from additional users from either the same or the opposite user group, but not simultaneously from both sides. As a consequence, many studies thoroughly quantify CNEs, yet do not consider SNEs (e.g., Brynjolfsson and Kemerer 1996) or use lagged sales as a proxy for SNEs (Sridhar et al. 2011). The few existing studies that investigate both direct CNEs and SNEs use their results to model individual behavior (Tucker and Zhang 2010) or network value (Asvanund et al. 2004), while our study examines the direct impact of network effects on the intermediary’s <b>revenue,</b> <b>number</b> of users and subscribers. We also notice that most studies employ data on a market level, while our study—as few others—uses a unique transactional data provided by a company.

40|$|Abstract—The {{performance}} of any cellular wireless network, {{as well as}} its <b>revenue</b> (<b>number</b> of customers using the network, and their degree of satisfaction) is determined to a great extent by its call admission control (CAC) protocol. As its name implies, the CAC determine if a new call request is granted, or rejected. In this paper, we propose a call admission control protocol for cellular multimedia wireless networks. Multimedia networks are characterized by a wide variety of bandwidth requests, priorities, and drop-off/rejection requirements by different customers. Our protocol depends on degrading the existing calls, according to their degradation priority, by reducing the bandwidth allocated to them in order to admit new calls according to their admission priority. Our protocol is too complicated for an analytical solution. However we present a Markov Model of a simplified version of our protocol for completeness, a Markov representation of the protocol is too complicated to be of any real value.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Multidimensional {{efficiency}} {{analysis can}} {{provide important insights}} into the performance of hospitals. In this paper, we propose a multidimensional model based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to investigate and compare the efficiency of public hospitals in Brazil. Methods Data from 21 public hospitals were collected from public databases (OECD - Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development; SIH-SUS - SUS Hospital Information System, Datasus, Brazil). Four inputs (Number of medical and non-medical staff, Annual <b>revenue,</b> <b>Number</b> of beds, Average length of patient hospitalization), four Variables of Influence (Type of hospital, Accredited hospital, Number of medical specialties, Resources from government) and four Outputs (Number of outpatient care services, Number of hospitalizations, Number of surgeries, Number of exams) were used to feed the DEA model. Results Seven hospital units reach 100 % efficiency and, according to DEA, can be considered efficient units. Two units were considered “almost efficient” and the remaining twelve units perform poorly, considering the data supplied to the DEA model. As a whole, the average efficiency of the hospitals investigated was 79 % (0. 79). Conclusion A very heterogeneous performance has been found among the Brazilian public hospitals investigated. Besides, the reasonably low average efficiency {{seems to indicate that}} the system has a large potential for improvement in almost all areas associated with the input and output variables investigated in this paper...|$|E

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that managers have a revealed preference for reporting total revenue numbers just above base-ten thresholds (i. e., “round” numbers) of the form N × 10 K. Examples are $ 10 million (1 × 107) and $ 4 billion (4 × 109). Our {{finding is consistent with}} a literature in psychology demonstrating that humans are susceptible to a cognitive bias associated with baseten reference points. However, we also document several rational explanations for this revenue management behavior on the part of managers. First, analyst revenue forecasts also exhibit this regularity, especially in early forecasts when greater uncertainty can potentially induce analysts to rely to a greater extent on heuristics, suggesting that managers may be managing reported revenue numbers to meet externally-determined base-ten-influenced benchmarks. In addition, the effect that we document is stronger for firms that face greater pressure to report high revenue growth, while firms that exceed base-ten revenue thresholds for the first time benefit from increased press coverage. Finally, we show that the revenue growth needed to stretch for a baseten threshold is not sustainable; firms that just exceed base-ten thresholds have lower subsequent revenue growth. Given that managers engage in extra, and, on average, unsustainable efforts to increase revenues to reach base-ten thresholds, our results suggest that revenue manipulation is even more pervasive than previously documented and that lenders, investors, auditors, and regulators should apply an extra degree of skepticism when a reported <b>revenue</b> <b>number</b> just exceeds a base-ten threshold...|$|E
