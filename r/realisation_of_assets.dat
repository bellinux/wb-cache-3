The paper includes a number of suggestions for reform, principally: eliminating the 50 per cent discount; incorporating all pre- 1986 assets; deemed <b>realisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> on death; and including owner-occupied housing above a certain value. These changes would raise a great deal of revenue, thus allowing for meaningful tax reform, and contribute to a sounder and fairer tax system...|$|E
40|$|This article reviews {{past and}} recent {{authorities}} that {{have addressed the}} definition and application of the solvency test in s 95 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The discussion highlights that, when faced with financial distress, company directors need to carefully consider the solvency implications of their decisions. To generate cash to pay debts as they become due, directors may attempt to realise company assets, obtain additional secured or unsecured debt finance or reorganise the timing of payments with creditors. The discussion of relevant cases shows that the solvency implications associated with <b>realisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets,</b> use of assets as security and reorganisation of timing of debts due are relatively well settled. However, the situation {{with respect to the}} use of unsecured debt requires caution by company directors...|$|E
40|$|Discharge {{a rescue}} mode of {{resolution}} of insolvency Summary The {{aim of this}} thesis {{is to provide a}} comprehensive analysis of the Institute of debt relief as one of the solution of bankruptcy. The work is divided into three chapters. The first chapter is a historical excursion, describing the evolution of resolving insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings in the world and in the Czech Republic. The second chapter deals with the general interpretation of the concept of bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings and its effects. The third and most extensive chapter then focuses on discharge from debts itself and its nodal points that are crucial in this process. Namely persons entitled to file a petition for permission to discharge debts, including the requirements of this petition, the court's decision on the permit and subsequent approval of discharge from debts, debt discharge methods and duties of the debtor, and finally the decision of fullfilment of debt discharge and exemption of debtor from debts. Act no. 182 / 2006 Coll. on bankruptcy and its solution (Insolvency Act) provides two methods of debt discharge. Debt discharge through the <b>realisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> or under the schedule payement. Both methods have in common that the debtor must pay at least 30 % of the total value of its unsecured debts and the unsecured [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Section 20 of the Income Tax Act, No 58 of 1962 {{allows a}} {{taxpayer}} that incurs an assessed loss to carry forward {{the balance of}} assessed loss incurred, to be set off against taxable income earned in or added to losses incurred in future years. The issues regarding the carry forward of assessed losses in terms of section 20 is complex {{and in terms of}} the said section, a company is only entitled to set off its assessed loss from the previous year against its taxable income in the current year, if the taxpayer has carried on a trade during the current year and has derived income from that trade. Under the provisions of section 20 (2 A), a taxpayer other than a company can utilise an assessed loss even if no trading has been conducted. Assessed losses of natural persons, may however be ring-fenced. The aim of this treatise was twofold. Firstly it was to gain clarity on the „trade‟ and „income from trade‟ issues and secondly to compare South African legislation with that of Australia, with a view to recommending a change in our rules regarding the treatment of assessed losses in the context of companies. The critical lessons to be learned from the cases presented, is that liquidators, creditors and others must ensure that the company continues trading in order to x keep the assessed losses valid. <b>Realisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> (including stock), and the collection of outstanding debts during liquidation does not constitute the carrying on of a trade in terms of s 20 (1). The continuity of trade is an important element in regard to the carry forward of assessed losses to be utilised in the current and future years. Therefore it is important that a company carries on some activity that falls within the definition of trade. In the landmark case of SA Bazaars, it was held that a company did not have to trade continuously throughout the year to qualify for the set-off of the assessed loss or carry forward of the assessed loss, that is, to trade for say part of the year. The court however left open the issue of whether it was necessary to derive income from that trade. In order to clarify the issues regarding assessed losses, SARS issued Interpretation Note 33 granting taxpayers a concession in certain cases where a company has traded, but not derived income from that trade. But in ITC 1830, the court ruled that a company must trade and must derive income from that trade in order to carry forward its assessed loss, which effectively means that SARS cannot apply Interpretation Note 33. SARS does not have the authority to make concession which is contrary to the wording of the Act. xi In Australia, operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely to be set-off against future income, provided a company meets the more than 50 % continuity of ownership test. Where the continuity test fails, losses can be deducted if the same business is carried on in the income year (the same business test). From the research conducted and in order to solve the issues surrounding the carry forward of assessed losses it was suggested that one of the following be adopted :- The method used in Australia for the carry forward of assessed losses., or A decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal is needed for a departure from the literal meaning of the words pertaining to the requirements regarding the carry forward of assessed losses. Furthermore, to clarify the definition of „income‟, as used in the context of s 20, is it gross income less exempt income or taxable income?. If section 20 relates to taxable income, then an assessed loss will never be increased, which it is submitted, is not what the legislature intended. Section 20 ought to be revisited to eliminate any uncertainty about the income requirement and in the context in which the word „income‟ is used in that section...|$|E

In 1993, the DAF group collapsed, and Ofasec appointed administrative receivers, which crystallised the floating charge into a fixed charge. The receivers realised the assets, paid preferential debts, and made interim distributions to Ofasec. £72m remained.

40|$|Industrial geographers are {{beginning}} to address country-specific changes in the wider setting of restructuring in the world economy. Developments in the New Zealand forestry sector are conceptualised as historically specific responses to structural processes, operating at global, national, and local scales. In this paper the changing state - economy relation associated with afforestation of exotic softwoods in New Zealand are examined, and forest utilisation issues are outlined. The emerging possibilities for the coordination of forestry production in New Zealand are also identified. Evidence is presented on the nature and degree of integration of 'New Zealand' private and state capital into the wood-fibre markets of the Pacific Rim. It is concluded that unprecedented restructuring in the 1980 s by organisations, both private and public, engaged in New Zealand's forestry production has made the <b>realisation</b> <b>of</b> forest <b>assets</b> in New Zealand difficult, with significant implications for owners of forests and for labour dependent on various facets of exotic forestry. ...|$|R

This means that, if a take over bid is accepted, shareholders in the target company will receive shares in the new merged entity. This has advantageous tax implications for investors as gains {{on the sale of}} shares acquired on or after 19 September 1985 are subject to capital gains tax. By receiving shares instead <b>of</b> cash the <b>realisation</b> <b>of</b> the capital <b>asset</b> can be delayed to take better advantage of capital loss offsets. Additionally, tax payers are only taxed on half the capital gain if they hold the asset for more than 12 months.|$|R
50|$|Attempts {{were made}} to avoid bankruptcy, and on 7 February 1832, an {{agreement}} was drawn up which recited that the accounts had been inspected on 21 January 1832, and that assets were sufficient to meet liabilities. Under this agreement, Waters, Jones & Co. would meet all the <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> Carmarthen Bank {{under the supervision of}} inspectors, who were to receive the proceeds <b>of</b> <b>realisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>assets</b> on trust for the bank’s creditors. This agreement contained a proviso that if the partners of Sir James Esdaile & Co., bankers of Lombard Street, London, and certain other creditors holding nine-tenths {{of the value of the}} bank’s debts, did not execute the agreement before 1 May 1832, the agreement would be void and a commission of bankruptcy would be issued against Waters, Jones & Co. Although the partners in the bank, and some of the creditors, signed the agreement, the partners of Sir James Esdaile & Co., who were owed a large amount, did not. A fiat of bankruptcy was issued, and the notes exhibited at the Ivy Bush Hotel, Carmarthen on 11 September 1832, when a first dividend of 5 shillings in the pound was paid.|$|R
50|$|The joint administrators {{refused to}} redeem {{vouchers}} acquired prior to 27 November 2008, with {{two reasons for}} their decision. Firstly, Zavvi did not own the stock in their stores. Prior to the administration, if customers redeemed their vouchers in Zavvi stores, Zavvi would pay {{the owner of the}} stock the retail sale price of the goods. In the normal course of the business, if a company is able to pay all its debts as they fall due, this is not a problem. At the date of the administration, Zavvi was insolvent and there were approximately 510,000 vouchers with a total value of around £4.1 million which had yet to be redeemed. If the administrators allowed vouchers to be redeemed against stock, {{they would have had to}} make payments to the owner of the stock, without receiving any monies from the 'sale' of the stock. The joint administrators believed this would have been to the detriment of other unsecured creditors of Zavvi Retail Limited. Secondly, the administrators stated that they have a duty to act in the interest of all creditors to realise assets and distribute funds according to statutory legal priorities as set out by the Insolvency Act. They are not able to prefer one creditor over another. Consequently, it was not possible to use monies realised from commission on the sale of stocks, or from the <b>realisation</b> <b>of</b> Zavvi's <b>assets,</b> to repay the voucher unsecured creditors ahead of other unsecured creditors.|$|R
