50|$|The ‘statement of compatibility’ {{contained}} in the Revised Explanatory Memorandum claimed the regime did not breach Australia’s human rights obligations under the ICCPR. However several submissions made to the PJCIS questioned the Bill’s compatibility with several human rights principles. In its 2014 submission, the Australian Privacy Foundation argued the Bill was incompatible with fundamental human rights and freedoms, especially the right to privacy. It pointed to a considerable body of legal opinion that has concluded that laws mandating blanket retention of metadata breach international human rights law. It submitted that the Bill breached fundamental rights to privacy because it was neither necessary for nor proportionate to legitimate national security and law enforcements objectives. According to the APF, blanket data retention regimes are disproportionate because they ‘indiscriminately mandate the <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> relating to entire populations, irrespective {{of the nature of}} the data or of whether or not there is a reasonable suspicions of a serious threat posed by those to whom the data relates’.|$|E
