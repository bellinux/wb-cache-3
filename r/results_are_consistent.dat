25|$|Special {{relativity}} is {{a physical}} theory that plays {{a fundamental role in}} the description of all physical phenomena, as long as gravitation is not significant. Many experiments played (and still play) an important role in its development and justification. The strength of the theory lies in its unique ability to correctly predict to high precision the outcome of an extremely diverse range of experiments. Repeats of many of those experiments are still being conducted with steadily increased precision, with modern experiments focusing on effects such as at the Planck scale and in the neutrino sector. Their <b>results</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with the predictions of special relativity. Collections of various tests were given by Jakob Laub, Zhang, Mattingly, Clifford Will, and Roberts/Schleif.|$|E

25|$|Significant {{cross-cultural}} variation {{has been}} observed in strong reciprocity behavior. In 2001, dictator game experiments were run in a 15 small scale societies across the world. The results of the experiments showed dramatic variation, with some groups mean offer as little as 26% and some as great as 58%. The pattern of receiver results was also interesting, with some participants in some cultures rejecting offers above 50%. Henrich and colleagues determined that the best predictors of dictator game allocations were {{the size of the}} group (small groups giving less) and market integration (the more involved with markets, the more participants gave). This study was then repeated with a different 15 small scale societies and with better measures of market integration, finding a similar pattern of results. These <b>results</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with the culture-gene coevolution hypothesis. A later paper by the same researchers identified religion as a third major contributor. Those people who participate in a world religion were more likely to exhibit strong reciprocity behavior.|$|E
500|$|Psilocybin {{is known}} to {{strongly}} influence the subjective experience of the passage of time. Users often feel as if time is slowed down, resulting in the perception that [...] "minutes appear to be hours" [...] or [...] "time is standing still". Studies have demonstrated that psilocybin significantly impairs subjects' ability to gauge time intervals longer than 2.5seconds, impairs their ability to synchronize to inter-beat intervals longer than 2seconds, and reduces their preferred tapping rate. These <b>results</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with the drug's role in affecting prefrontal cortex activity, and {{the role that the}} prefrontal cortex {{is known to}} play in time perception. However, the neurochemical basis of psilocybin's effects on the perception of time are not known with certainty.|$|E

A simple fault plane model with a width of 12.8km dipping to the southeast makes a reasonable match with the observed uplift pattern. [...] However, the best fit to both the results from body wave modelling and SAR interferometry comes from a model with two contiguous fault segments, one to the northeast with a strike of 025°, {{and the other to}} the southwest with a strike of 065°, both with an overall southeasterly dip. It has been suggested that this earthquake and the 2005 Qeshm event may have ruptured adjacent parts of the same fault.|$|E

The atom labels used {{are the same as}} those shown in the crystal structure above. Within the unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, the carbon–carbon bond lengths vary between 1.35Å and 1.40Å and the internal bond angles vary between 107° and 109°. For comparison, the internal angle at each vertex of a regular pentagon is 108°. The rhodium–carbon bond lengths vary between 2.16Å and 2.18Å. These <b>results</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with η5-coordination of the ligand to the metal centre. In the case of the substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, there is somewhat greater variation: carbon–carbon bond lengths vary between 1.39Å and 1.48Å, the internal bond angles vary between 106° and 111°, and the rhodium–carbon bond lengths vary between 2.14Å and 2.20Å. The greater variation in the substituted ligand is attributed to the distortions necessary to relieve the steric strain imposed by neighbouring tert-butyl substituents; despite these variations, the data demonstrate that the substituted cyclopentadienyl is also η5-coordinated.|$|E

We analysed the HLA antigens of 76 unrelated Somalis who lived in the west of England. HLA -A, -B, -C and DRB1 typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP) at a low-intermediate resolution level. Phenotype frequency, gene frequency and haplotype frequency were used to study the relationship between Somalis and other relevant populations. The antigens with highest frequencies were HLA -A1, A2, and A30; B7, B51 and B39; Cw7, Cw16, Cw17, Cw15 and Cw18; DR 13, DR17, DR8 and DR1. HLA haplotypes with high significance and characteristics of the Somali {{population are}} B7-Cw7, B39-Cw12, B51-Cw16, B57-Cw18.
