5|$|Some dishes can {{be traced}} back to ancient Greece: lentil soup, fasolada, <b>retsina</b> (white or rosé wine {{flavoured}} with pine resin) and pasteli (sesame seeds baked with honey); some to the Hellenistic and Roman periods: loukaniko (dried pork sausage); and Byzantium: feta cheese, avgotaraho (bottarga) and paximadhia (rusk).|$|E
5|$|Their diet {{consisted}} of mainly grains and beans and in fishing communities fish was usually substituted for meat. Bread, wine, and olives were important staples of Byzantine diet with soldiers on campaign eating double-baked and dried bread called paximadion (Greek: παξιμάδιον). As in antiquity and modern times, {{the most common}} cultivations in the choraphia (Greek: χωράφια) were olive groves and vineyards. While Liutprand of Cremona, a visitor from Italy, found Greek wine irritating as it was often flavoured with resin (<b>retsina)</b> most other Westerners admired Greek wines, Cretan in particular being famous.|$|E
25|$|Cretan wine came to {{prominence}} later. A secondary wine made from water and pomace (the residue from squeezed grapes), mixed with lees, {{was made by}} country people for their own use. The Greeks sometimes sweetened their wine with honey and made medicinal wines by adding thyme, pennyroyal and other herbs. By the first century, if not before, they were familiar with wine flavoured with pine resin (modern <b>retsina).</b> Aelian also mentions a wine mixed with perfume. Cooked wine was known, {{as well as a}} sweet wine from Thásos, similar to port wine.|$|E

25|$|The {{spread of}} wine culture westwards was most {{probably}} due to the Phoenicians who spread outward from a base of city-states along the Lebanese, Syrian, Palestinian, and Israeli coasts. The wines of Byblos were exported to Egypt during the Old Kingdom and then throughout the Mediterranean. Evidence includes two Phoenician shipwrecks from 750 BC discovered by Robert Ballard, whose cargo of wine was still intact. As the first great traders in wine (cherem), the Phoenicians seem to have protected it from oxidation with a layer of olive oil, followed by a seal of pinewood and resin, similar to <b>retsina.</b>|$|E
25|$|Greek cuisine is {{characteristic}} of the healthy Mediterranean diet, which is epitomized by dishes of Crete. Greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients {{into a variety of}} local dishes such as moussaka, pastitsio, classic Greek salad, fasolada, spanakopita and souvlaki. Some dishes {{can be traced back to}} ancient Greece like skordalia (a thick purée of walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), lentil soup, <b>retsina</b> (white or rosé wine sealed with pine resin) and pasteli (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as meze with various dips such as tzatziki, grilled octopus and small fish, feta cheese, dolmades (rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various pulses, olives and cheese. Olive oil is added to almost every dish.|$|E
25|$|In {{the manner}} of Greek wine, Roman wine was often flavored with herbs and spices (similar to modern vermouth and mulled wine) and was {{sometimes}} stored in resin-coated containers, giving it a flavor similar to modern <b>retsina.</b> Romans were {{particularly interested in the}} aroma of wine and experimented with various methods of enhancing a wine's bouquet. One technique that gained some usage in southern Gaul was planting herbs such as lavender and thyme in the vineyards, believing that their flavors would pass through the ground and into the grapes. Modern-day wines from the Rhone are often characterized by using the aroma descriptors of lavender and thyme, presumably as a reflection of the grape varieties used and the terroir. Another widespread practice was the storage of amphoras in a smoke chamber called a fumarium to add smokiness to a wine's flavor.|$|E

25|$|Vitis vinifera {{evidence}} from ancient Rome shows wine was cultivated and then domesticated in Lebanon, {{at least two}} thousand years before Alexander the Great. While some people believe it arrived from the South Caucasus via Mesopotamia or the Black Sea trade routes {{there is no record}} to support such a claim. Vines grew readily in the land of Canaan, the coastal strip of today's Lebanon, and the wines of Byblos (Gubla, Gebal, Jubail, Jbeil) were exported to Egypt during the Old Kingdom (2686 BC–2134 BC). The wines of Tyre and Sidon were famous throughout the ancient Mediterranean, although not all the cargoes reached their destination; Robert Ballard of Titanic fame found the wrecks of two Phoenician ships from 750 BC, whose cargo of wine was still intact. As the first great traders of wine ('Cherem'), the Phoenicians seem to have protected it from oxidation with a layer of olive oil, followed by a seal of pinewood and resin—this may well be the origin of the Greek taste for <b>retsina.</b> The philosophers Zeno of Citium and Chrysippus of Soli are both said to have enjoyed their wine, in fact the latter died from overindulgence.|$|E
500|$|The Byzantine culture was, initially, {{the same}} as Late Greco-Roman, but over the {{following}} millennium of the empire's existence it slowly changed into something more similar to modern Balkan and Anatolian culture. The cuisine still relied heavily on the Greco-Roman fish-sauce condiment garos, but it also contained foods still familiar today, such as the cured meat pastirma (known as [...] "paston" [...] in Byzantine Greek), baklava (known as koptoplakous κοπτοπλακοῦς), tiropita (known as plakountas tetyromenous or tyritas plakountas), and the famed medieval sweet wines (Commandaria and the eponymous Rumney wine). <b>Retsina,</b> wine flavored with pine resin, was also drunk, as it still is in Greece today, producing similar reactions from unfamiliar visitors; [...] "To add to our calamity the Greek wine, on account of being mixed with pitch, resin, and plaster was to us undrinkable," [...] complained Liutprand of Cremona, who was the ambassador sent to Constantinople in 968 by the German Holy Roman Emperor Otto I. The garos fish sauce condiment was also not much appreciated by the unaccustomed; Liutprand of Cremona described being served food covered in an [...] "exceedingly bad fish liquor." [...] The Byzantines also used a soy sauce like condiment, murri, a fermented barley sauce, which, like soy sauce, provided umami flavoring to their dishes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{evidence}} for winemaking consisted of six [...] jars that were {{embedded in the}} floor of what archeologists suspect was a kitchen area in a mudbrick building that was inhabited some time between 5400–5000 BC.

2500|$|Both Hesiod's {{writings}} and Homer's Odyssey {{include some of}} the earliest mentions of straw wine production: laying out freshly harvested grapes on mats to dry nearly to raisins before pressing.

Other Greek innovations include the harvest of deliberately unripe grapes in producing a more acidic wine for blending. The boiling of grape must was discovered as another means of adding sweetness to the wine. The Greeks believed wine could also be improved by adding resin, herbs, spice, seawater, brine, oil and perfume. <b>Retsina,</b> mulled wine and vermouth are some modern examples of these practices.|$|E
