40|$|The recent {{continuous}} development of Cooperative ITS {{has resulted in}} several initiatives which focus on {{different parts of the}} Cooperative environment landscape. The FOTsis project focuses on the infrastructure side of the Cooperative environment and will deploy and test 7 services designed to maximise the benefits of the integration of the road operator and infrastructure-based information providers into the ITS environment. This integration can take place in any of the stages of data collection, processing and actuations of the services, but also support and trigger external tasks such as operations of the emergency <b>response</b> <b>entities,</b> etc. This paper describes the current status of the project and focuses on the specification of the supporting architecture to the services tested: references, a brief outline of the requirements’ definition, and the FOTsis architecture proposal, with some conclusions about the architecture tests conducted.

40|$|Techniques for augmenting the {{automation}} {{of routine}} coordination are rapidly reaching {{a level of}} effectiveness where they can simulate realistic coordination {{on the ground for}} large numbers of emergency <b>response</b> <b>entities</b> (e. g. fire engines, police cars) for the sake of training. Furthermore, it seems inevitable that future disaster response systems will utilize such technology. We have constructed a new system, DEFACTO (Demonstrating Effective Flexible Agent Coordination of Teams through Omnipresence), that integrates state-of-the-art agent reasoning capabilities and 3 D visualization into a unique high fidelity system for training incident commanders. The DEFACTO system achieves this goal via three main components: (i) Omnipresent Viewer- intuitive interface, (ii) Proxy Framework- for team coordination, and (iii) Flexible Interaction- between the incident commander and the team. We have performed detailed preliminary experiments with DEFACTO in the fire-fighting domain. In addition, DEFACTO has been repeatedly demonstrated to key police and fire department personnel in Los Angeles area, with very positive feedback.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} some convergence in {{the architecture of}} entity search systems driven by a knowledge graph (KG) and a corpus with annotated entity mentions. However, each specific system has some limitations. We present AQQUCN, an entity search system that combines the best design principles into a public reference implementation. AQQUCN {{does not depend on}} well formed question syntax, but works equally well with syntax poor keyword queries. It uses several convolutional networks (convnets) to extract subtle, overlapping roles of query words. Instead of ranking structured query interpretations, which are then executed on the KG to return unranked sets, AQQUCN directly ranks <b>response</b> <b>entities,</b> by closely integrating coarse grained predicates from the KG with fine grained scoring from the corpus, into a single ranking model. Over and above competitive F 1 score, AQQUCN gets the best entity ranking accuracy on two syntax rich and two syntax poor public query workloads amounting to over 8, 000 queries, with 16 to 18 percent absolute improvement in mean average precision (MAP), compared to recent systems...|$|R
40|$|Project (M. S., Computer Science) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Demand {{response}} {{programs are}} used in smart grid to improve stability of the electric grid and to reduce consumption of electricity and costs during peak times. One of the key aspects in demand response programs is for utilities to provide secure information to customers. Various threats and attacks could hinder the propagation of crucial information related to price, electricity usage, device and customer information. Privacy of utility, customer and other demand <b>response</b> <b>entities</b> could be at risk due to the vulnerabilities. This project analyzes security issues, best practices, and research issues in demand response program. It illustrates various security issues and possible best practices for the demand response program. It covers proper data handling practices for maintaining confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability. Some of the countermeasures are inadequate for Smart Grid architecture and hence require more research. Some of the research issues are discussed. In conclusion, this project helped evaluate security privacy issues and possible best practices for energy efficient solutions associated with demand response system. Computer Scienc...|$|R

40|$|Many State and Federal {{environmental}} protection {{laws and regulations}} apply to Western. Western facilities are within the jurisdiction of six Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regions and 17 states. Western's environmental policy statement directs employees to prevent, control, and abate environmental pollution at their facilities, and when possible, enhance the environment. To help assure conformance with all regulatory requirements, and to achieve its pollution prevention goals and objectives, Western is developing an Environmental Management System (EMS). One of the major regulatory impacts on Western {{continues to be the}} Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) that regulates the use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). Western's policy is to eliminate PCBs from its system wherever economically and operationally possible. This will lessen the impact of PCB regulations on operations and the impact of PCBs on the environment. Executive Order 12856 requires Federal Agencies to comply with the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). As with other DOE elements, Western has been complying with EPCRA since before the Executive Order was issued. To summarize, in 1999, Western's Regional offices implemented programs to notify State and local emergency <b>response</b> <b>entities</b> in accordance with Section 311 and 312 of EPCRA. Chemical inventories indicate that Western does not manufacture, process, or otherwise use reportable quantities of EPCRA Section 313 chemicals so Toxic Release reports were not required...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in Cu/Zn {{superoxide}} dismutase (SOD 1) {{are linked to}} motor neuron death in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by an unclear mechanism, although misfolded SOD 1 aggregates are commonly associated with disease. Proteomic analysis of the transgenic SOD 1 [G 93 A] ALS rat model revealed significant up-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -resident protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) family members in lumbar spinal cords. Expression of SOD 1 mutants (mSOD 1) led to an up-regulation of PDI in motor neuron-like NSC- 34 cells but not other cell lines. Inhibition of PDI using bacitracin increased aggregate production, even in wild type SOD 1 transfectants that do not readily form inclusions, suggesting PDI may protect SOD 1 from aggregation. Moreover, PDI co-localized with intracellular aggregates of mSOD 1 and bound to both wild type and mSOD 1. SOD 1 was {{also found in the}} microsomal fraction of cells despite being a predominantly cytosolic enzyme, confirming ER-Golgi-dependent secretion. In SOD 1 [G 93 A] mice, a significant up-regulation of unfolded protein <b>response</b> <b>entities</b> was also observed during disease, including caspase- 12, - 9, and - 3 cleavage. Our findings therefore implicate unfolded protein response and ER stress-induced apoptosis in the patho-physiology of familial ALS. The possibility that PDI may be a therapeutic target to prevent SOD 1 aggregation is also raised by this study. 14 page(s...|$|R

I argue that Carnap fails to provide a cogent argument for the meaninglessness of ontological questions.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a ready-to-use security assessment framework for {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs).

40|$|The article aims at {{relating}} {{the process of}} development of a professional identity among pedagogues in Brazil, the historical path of Pedagogy as a course, the educational legislation in Brazil and Colégio Pedro II. Colégio Pedro II is an educational institution of excellence, whose history, of national importance, has dealt very little with working relationships outside the classroom. For this reason, {{the objective of this}} study is to promote discussions which, regarding professional identities, take into consideration not only the subject, but also the group to which they belong. In terms of theoretical support, the author relies on the sociological approach discussed by Dubar (2005) and the analysis of the history of pedagogy courses carried out by Silva (2006). In addition, other relevant instances are public selection notices for admission to Colégio Pedro II from 1946 to 2015, academic studies upon the theme and <b>responses</b> from <b>entities</b> and professionals in the field of Education upon the pedagogy course programmes. The author takes into account that identities of both the pedagogue and the educational matters technician (TAE) are entangled at institutional level, which shows that the institution is still unsure of what to require and demand from both professionals. Although these educational matters professionals have licentiate degrees in other areas, it is still expected at institutional level that they act as specialists in education (pedagogue). ...|$|R
