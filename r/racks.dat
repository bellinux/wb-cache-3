40|$|Abstract Background <b>RACK</b> 1 is a {{versatile}} scaffold protein in mammals, regulating diverse developmental processes. Unlike in non-plant organisms where <b>RACK</b> 1 is encoded {{by a single}} gene, Arabidopsis genome contains three <b>RACK</b> 1 homologous genes, designated as <b>RACK</b> 1 A, <b>RACK</b> 1 B and <b>RACK</b> 1 C, respectively. Previous studies indicated that the loss-of-function alleles of <b>RACK</b> 1 A displayed multiple defects in plant development. However, the functions of <b>RACK</b> 1 B and <b>RACK</b> 1 C remain elusive. Further, the relationships between three <b>RACK</b> 1 homologous genes are unknown. Results We isolated mutant alleles with loss-of-function mutations in <b>RACK</b> 1 B and <b>RACK</b> 1 C, and examined {{the impact of these}} mutations on plant development. We found that unlike in <b>RACK</b> 1 A, loss-of-function mutations in <b>RACK</b> 1 B or <b>RACK</b> 1 C do not confer apparent defects in plant development, including rosette leaf production and root development. Analyses of <b>rack</b> 1 a, <b>rack</b> 1 b and <b>rack</b> 1 c double and triple mutants, however, revealed that <b>rack</b> 1 b and <b>rack</b> 1 c can enhance the <b>rack</b> 1 a mutant's developmental defects, and an extreme developmental defect and lethality were observed in <b>rack</b> 1 a <b>rack</b> 1 b <b>rack</b> 1 c triple mutant. Complementation studies indicated that <b>RACK</b> 1 B and <b>RACK</b> 1 C are in principle functionally equivalent to <b>RACK</b> 1 A. Gene expression studies indicated that three <b>RACK</b> 1 genes display similar expression patterns but are expressed at different levels. Further, <b>RACK</b> 1 genes positively regulate each other's expression. Conclusion These results suggested that <b>RACK</b> 1 genes are critical regulators of plant development and that <b>RACK</b> 1 genes function in an unequally redundant manner. Both the difference in <b>RACK</b> 1 gene expression level and the cross-regulation are likely the molecular determinants of their unequal genetic redundancy. </p...|$|R
50|$|A <b>Rack</b> rail, or <b>rack</b> strip, is used {{to mount}} rackable {{electronic}} hardware and 19-inch <b>rack</b> mount accessories within a 19-inch <b>rack.</b> Within a <b>rack</b> {{a minimum of two}} <b>rack</b> rails are required to mount equipment.

5|$|The E-4 variant {{was fitted}} with {{external}} bomb <b>racks</b> also {{and the empty}} bomb bay space was filled with an 835L (221US gal) tank for aviation fuel and a further 115L (30US gal) oil tank. This increased the loaded weight but increased range to 1,800km (1,130mi). The modifications allowed the He 111 to perform both long- and short-range missions. The E-4's eight internal vertically aligned bomb <b>racks</b> could each carry a 250kg (550lb) bomb. The last E Variant, the He 111E-5, was powered by the Jumo 211A-3, and retained the 835L (221US gal) fuel tank {{on the port side}} of the bomb bay. Only a few of the E-4 and E-5 were built.|$|E

40|$|Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (<b>RACK</b> 1) {{is viewed}} as a {{versatile}} scaffold protein in mammals. The protein sequence of <b>RACK</b> 1 is highly conserved in eukaryotes. However, the function of <b>RACK</b> 1 in plants remains poorly understood. Accumulating evidence suggested that <b>RACK</b> 1 may be involved in hormone responses, but the precise role of <b>RACK</b> 1 in any hormone signalling pathway remains elusive. Molecular and genetic evidence that Arabidopsis <b>RACK</b> 1 is a negative regulator of ABA responses is provided here. It is shown that three <b>RACK</b> 1 genes act redundantly to regulate ABA responses in seed germination, cotyledon greening and root growth, because <b>rack</b> 1 a single and double mutants are hypersensitive to ABA in each of these processes. On the other hand, plants overexpressing <b>RACK</b> 1 A displayed ABA insensitivity. Consistent with their proposed roles in seed germination and early seedling development, all three <b>RACK</b> 1 genes were expressed in imbibed, germinating and germinated seeds. It was found that the ABA-responsive marker genes, RD 29 B and RAB 18, were up-regulated in <b>rack</b> 1 a mutants. Furthermore, the expression of all three <b>RACK</b> 1 genes themselves was down-regulated by ABA. Consistent with the view that <b>RACK</b> 1 negatively regulates ABA responses, <b>rack</b> 1 a mutants lose water significantly more slowly from the rosettes and are hypersensitive to high concentrations of NaCl during seed germination. In addition, the expression of some putative <b>RACK</b> 1 -interacting, ABA-, or abiotic stress-regulated genes was mis-regulated in <b>rack</b> 1 a <b>rack</b> 1 b double mutants in response to ABA. Taken together, these findings provide compelling evidence that <b>RACK</b> 1 is a critical, negative regulator of ABA responses...|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the H-11 and H-16 the H-20, equipped with two Jumo 211F-2s, had more powerful armament and radio communications. The defensive armament consisted of one MG 131 in an A-Stand gun pod for the forward mounted machine gun position. One rotatable Drehlafette DL 131/1C (or E) gun mount in the B-stand was standard and later MG 131 machine guns were added. Navigational direction-finding gear was also installed. The Peil G6 was added to locate targets and the FuBI 2H blind landing equipment was built in to help with night operations. The radio was a standard FuG 10, TZG 10 and FuG 16Z for navigating to the target. The H-20 also was equipped with barrage balloon cable-cutters. The bomb load of the H-20 could be mounted on external ETC 1000 <b>racks,</b> or four ESAC 250 <b>racks.</b> The sub variant H-20/R4 could carry 20 50kg (110lb) bombs as external loads.|$|E

5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition <b>racks</b> welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine.

5000|$|The {{geometry}} of the <b>rack</b> system has a large impact {{on the construction of}} turnouts. If the <b>rack</b> is elevated above the running rails, {{there is no need to}} interrupt the running rails to allow passage of the driving pinions of the engines. Strub explicitly documented this in his U.S. patent. [...] Strub used a complex set of bell-cranks and push-rods linking the throw-rod for the points to the two throw-rods for the moving <b>rack</b> sections. One break in the <b>rack</b> was required to select between the two routes, and a second break was required where the <b>rack</b> rails cross the running rails. Turnouts for the Morgan <b>Rack</b> system were similar, with the <b>rack</b> elevated above the running rails. Most of the Morgan turnout patents included movable <b>rack</b> sections to avoid breaks in the <b>rack,</b> but because all Morgan locomotives had two linked drive pinions, there was no need for a continuous <b>rack.</b> So long as the breaks in the <b>rack</b> were shorter than the distance between the drive pinions on the locomotive, the <b>rack</b> rail could be interrupted wherever there was need to cross over a running rail.|$|R
