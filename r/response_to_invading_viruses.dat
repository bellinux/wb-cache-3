40|$|Sensitization of the humoral immune <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>invading</b> <b>viruses</b> and {{production}} of antiviral antibodies forms part of the host antiviral repertoire. Paradoxically, {{for a number of}} viral pathogens, under certain conditions, antibodies provide an attractive means of enhanced virus entry and replication in a number of cell types. Known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, the phenomenon occurs when virus-antibody immunocomplexes interact with cells bearing complement or Fc receptors, promoting internalization of the virus and increasing infection. Frequently associated with exacerbation of viral disease, ADE of infection presents a major obstacle to the prevention of viral disease by vaccination and is thought to be partly responsible for the adverse effects of novel antiviral therapeutics such as intravenous immunoglobulins. There is a growing body of work examining the intracellular signaling pathways and epitopes responsible for mediating ADE, with a view to aiding rational design of antiviral strategies. With in vitro studies also confirming ADE as a feature of infection for a growing number of viruses, challenges remain in understanding the multilayered molecular mechanisms of ADE and its effect on viral pathogenesis...|$|E

40|$|Immune {{regulation}} of cellular metabolism can {{be responsible for}} successful <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>invading</b> pathogens. <b>Viruses</b> alter their hosts' cellular metabolism to facilitate infection. Conversely, the innate antiviral responses of mammalian cells target these metabolic pathways to restrict viral propagation. We identified miR- 130 b and miR- 185 as hepatic microRNAs (miRNAs) whose expression is stimulated by 25 -hydroxycholesterol (25 -HC), an antiviral oxysterol secreted by interferon-stimulated macrophages and dendritic cells, during hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, 25 -HC only directly stimulated miR- 185 expression, whereas HCV regulated miR- 130 b expression. Independently, miR- 130 b and miR- 185 inhibited HCV infection. In particular, miR- 185 significantly restricted host metabolic pathways crucial to the HCV life cycle. Interestingly, HCV infection decreased miR- 185 and miR- 130 b levels to promote lipid accumulation and counteract 25 -HC's antiviral effect. Furthermore, miR- 185 can inhibit other viruses through the {{regulation of}} immunometabolic pathways. These data establish these microRNAs as a key link between innate defenses and metabolism in the liver. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|In {{bacteria}} and archaea, viruses {{are the primary}} infectious agents, acting as virulent, often deadly pathogens. A form of adaptive immune defense known as CRISPR-Cas enables microbial cells to acquire immunity to viral pathogens by recognizing specific sequences encoded in viral genomes. The unique biology of this system results in evolutionary dynamics of host and viral diversity that cannot be fully explained by the traditional models used to describe microbe-virus coevolutionary dynamics. Here, we show how the CRISPR-mediated adaptive immune <b>response</b> of hosts <b>to</b> <b>invading</b> <b>viruses</b> facilitates {{the emergence of an}} evolutionary mode we call distributed immunity - the coexistence of multiple, equally-fit immune alleles among individuals in a microbial population. We use an eco-evolutionary modeling framework to quantify distributed immunity and demonstrate how it emerges and fluctuates in multi-strain communities of hosts and viruses as a consequence of CRISPR-induced coevolution under conditions of low viral mutation and high relative numbers of viral protospacers. We demonstrate that distributed immunity promotes sustained diversity and stability in host communities and decreased viral population density that can lead to viral extinction. We analyze sequence diversity of experimentally coevolving populations of Streptococcus thermophilus and their viruses where CRISPR-Cas is active, and find the rapid emergence of distributed immunity in the host population, demonstrating the importance of this emergent phenomenon in evolving microbial communities...|$|R
40|$|Student Number : 9610284 H - MSc {{dissertation}} - School of Molecular and Cell Biology - Faculty of ScienceCassava Mosaic Disease is {{the most}} devastating disease affecting cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) crops worldwide. This disease is associated with eight species of geminiviruses, all belonging to the genus Begomovirus of the family Geminiviridae. In South Africa, in particular, CMD is caused by South African cassava mosaic virus (SACMV). Currently, there are no adequate methods for control of this disease as mechanisms within virus-host interactions are poorly understood. This brings {{about the need for}} development of virus-disease control strategies. This study was therefore conducted to identify the host’s <b>response</b> <b>to</b> an <b>invading</b> <b>virus.</b> The model plant, Arabidopsis was chosen as it is a well-characterized plant system, with expression databases readily available as its entire genome has been sequenced. This study was conducted, firstly, to phenotypically determine if Arabidopsis was resistant or susceptible to SACMV infection, and secondly, to identify the host’s <b>response</b> <b>to</b> pathogen infection on a molecular level through gene expression studies utilizing microarrays. Results from the symptomatology study revealed that Arabidopsis plants were fully symptomatic 28 days post-inoculation, displaying characteristic disease symptoms such as stunting, yellowing, and leaf deformation. This indicated that Arabidopsis was susceptible to SACMV infection. Microarray analyses revealed 86 differentially expressed genes, of which 48 showed up-regulation and 38 down-regulation. Relative quantification real-time PCR was performed on selected genes to confirm these results. Many up-regulated genes were shown to be primarily involved in a general stress response induced by the host, whereas those genes that were downregulated seemed to be involved in more specific <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> viral invasion, probably a consequence of suppression of host genes by SACMV to enhance its own replication. The majority of genes identified fell under the predominant functional categories involved in metabolism, transcription, and transport. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which a DNA geminivirus has been used in a host-pathogen interaction utilizing microarrays...|$|R

Feedback mechanisms of these cytokines cause a suppression of the Th2 lymphocytes and a reduction of Th2 cytokine production (mainly IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13).

However, {{the effects that}} S 1 P-catalyzing enzymes have on host defense and immunity <b>to</b> <b>invading</b> <b>viruses</b> remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of S 1 P-metabolyzing enzymes in modulating cellular <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> influenza virus infection. Over- expression of S 1 P lyase (SPL), which induces degradation of S 1 P on cells (SPL-cells), interfered with the propagation of influenza virus. Accordingly, SPL-cells were much more resistant to the cytopathic effects caused by influenza virus infection than the control cells. SPL-mediated inhibition of cellular death was supported by impairment of the upregulation of a pro-apoptotic protein Bax, a critical factor for influenza viral cyto-pathogenicity. Importantly, the virus-infected SPL-cells induced early activation of STAT 1 and STAT 2 that are representative proteins for the anti-viral type I IFN signaling. These results suggest that SPL suppresses influenza virus replication via rapid activation of host innate immunity. In contrast to the SPL, the over-expression of S 1 P-producing sphingosine kinase 1 heightened the cells' susceptibility to influenza viral infection with suppressed STAT 1 activation, representing opposed enzymatic activity. These {{findings suggest that the}} modulation of S 1 P-metabolyzing enzymes is crucial for controlling host innate immunity and resultant host defense against influenza viral infection.
