50|$|A pledge {{does not}} give the pledgor (or debtor) the option of {{retaining}} the property while burdening it with the real security right, {{but it can be}} created in respect both of corporeal and of <b>incorporeal</b> <b>property.</b> A pledge in respect of <b>incorporeal</b> <b>property</b> is commonly referred to as a security cession (cessio in securitatem debiti), meaning that a claim against a third party is ceded to the pledgee; in this case, personal rights vest in the pledgee. Control that vests in the pledgee is known as quasi-control. The primary claim, however, remains vested in the pledgor. An act of publicity may be required: for example, sending notice of cession to the pledgor's debtors.|$|R
50|$|As {{a general}} rule, the {{judgment}} creditor {{is entitled to}} {{as much of the}} property of the judgment debtor as satisfies the judgment, plus costs. The property attached may be either movable property, immovable <b>property</b> or <b>incorporeal</b> <b>property,</b> although the mode of attachment of each is different.|$|R
50|$|<b>Incorporeal</b> <b>{{property}},</b> whether movable or immovable, {{may also}} be attached. Such property may {{take the form of}} a lease, a bill of exchange, a promissory note, a bond or other security for the payment of money. It may also {{take the form of a}}n interest in a partnership, shares in a company, or a member’s interest in a close corporation.|$|R
50|$|Patrimonial assets {{or private}} domain are all those assets {{owned by the}} state that do not fall within the {{category}} of public domain assets. In this way, leasing rights, securities representing shares and {{shares in the capital}} of commercial companies or of bonds issued by them, as well as futures and options contracts whose underlying assets consist of shares or participations in commercial entities, <b>incorporeal</b> <b>property</b> rights, and rights of any nature arising from the ownership of the assets and economic rights.|$|R
50|$|The Lordship {{passed to}} Lady Lavinia Enid Muriel Baird in 1961 and was {{conveyed}} {{to the lawyer}} and Writer to The Signet William Ronald Crawford Miller in 1978. After the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 the Lordship and Barony of Pittenweem became an <b>incorporeal</b> heritable <b>property,</b> no longer attached to the land.|$|R
50|$|Intangible property, {{also known}} as <b>incorporeal</b> <b>property,</b> {{describes}} something which a person or corporation can have ownership of and can transfer ownership to another person or corporation, but has no physical substance, for example brand identity or knowledge/intellectual property. It generally refers to statutory creations such as copyright, trademarks, or patents. It excludes tangible property like real property (land, buildings, and fixtures) and personal property (ships, automobiles, tools, etc.). In some jurisdictions intangible property {{are referred to as}} choses in action. Intangible property is used in distinction to tangible property. It is useful to note that there are two forms of intangible property: legal intangible property (which is discussed here) and competitive intangible property (which is the source from which legal intangible property is created but cannot be owned, extinguished, or transferred). Competitive intangible property disobeys the intellectual property test of voluntary extinguishment and therefore results in the sources that create intellectual property (knowledge in its source form, collaboration, process-engagement, etc.) escaping quantification.|$|R
5000|$|After 28 November 2004 under Scots law, a Scottish Barony, {{which was}} {{previously}} Scottish heritable property (real <b>property),</b> became <b>incorporeal</b> heritable <b>property</b> (not {{attached to the}} land). Prior to the Act coming into effect, Scottish Feudal Baronies (including Lordships and Earldoms) were the only genuine title of UK nobility capable of being transferred following the sale of land containing a [...] "caput" [...] (or {{the sale of a}} feudal superiority).|$|R
25|$|The law of arms as {{understood}} in Scotland {{consists of two}} principal parts, the rules of heraldry (such as blazoning), and the law of heraldry. In contrast to the position in England, the Law of Arms is {{a branch of the}} civil law. A coat of arms is <b>incorporeal</b> heritable <b>property,</b> governed, subject to certain specialities, by the general law applicable to such property. The possession of armorial bearings is therefore unquestionably a question of property. The misappropriation of arms is a real injury, actionable under the common law of Scotland.|$|R
5000|$|The High Court of Australia {{has taken}} a wide view {{of the concept of}} [...] "property". Several members of the court took the {{opportunity}} to consider the meaning of the term property in Minister of State for the Army v Dalziel (1944). Justice Starke said the term includes: [...] "every species of valuable right and interest including real and personal <b>property,</b> <b>incorporeal</b> hereditaments such as rents and services, rights-of-way, rights of profit or use in land of another, and choses in action. Justice McTiernan confirmed the term property extends to tangible and intangible property.|$|R

[...] Department of Economics and Social Sciences Consortium. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2016 This dissertation presents {{an examination of}} the pharmaceutical industry with a primary focus on the importance of intangible assets from the original institutional economics perspective. This is done in three main chapters. The first main chapter examines the importance of intangible assets {{within the context of the}} heterodox theory of the business enterprise. It is argued that in the early stage of the going concern – where production is separate from consumption – intangible assets necessitate the creation of monetary bargaining transactions. In industrial capitalism – with the internal separation of the enterprise into industrial and pecuniary divisions – intangible assets take the form of rationing transactions, limiting the number of sellers of a particular product. As the enterprise then evolves into its modern joint-stock form in money manager capitalism, intangible assets become the basis for capitalization, upon which <b>incorporeal</b> <b>property</b> may be issued, increasing the return to shareholders. The second main chapter discusses the structure and performance of the pharmaceutical industry. Based on the concept of centralized private sector planning and Alfred Chandler’s theory of learned organizational capabilities, I develop a core nexus understanding of pharmaceutical industry activity. The core is seen as made up of 15 firms who dictate the direction and evolution of the industry as a whole. I then examine the performance of this core using measurements of financial ratios. Measuring performance in this way is consistent with the stated motives of the business enterprise under money manager capitalism, which embodies the dominance of pecuniary habits of thought over industrial ones. The third main chapter combines the first two, examining one specific member of the core – the Pfizer Corporation – and examines the importance of intangible assets on its activity. Over time, it is shown that Pfizer has become more reliant on intangible assets as an overall portion of total assets, its net tangible assets – the book value of the company – has become negative, and Pfizer relies more heavily on drugs obtained through acquisition, rather than internal development. Money manager capitalism, as a regime of accumulation, rewards enterprises that take on an intangible characteristic. In the pharmaceutical industry, this is done with the aid of mergers and acquisitions due to accounting rules for intangible items such as goodwill and the division of labor between the core and nexus. Dominant pharmaceutical firms, then, should be seen as rent-collecting institutions, as opposed to productive entities. Introduction [...] Intangible assets and the business enterprise: understanding corporate control over social relations [...] Structure and performance of the pharmaceutical industry: an original institutional economic perspective [...] Intangible assets and the Pfizer Corporation: the importance of mergers, acquisition, and strategic dealings [...] Conclusio...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the diploma thesis is to complete company guidelines in a chosen company that deals with project and construction activities. The theoretical part contains procedures concerning the internal accounting guidelines and definitions of the legislation of the Czech Republic that influences the creation and composition of individual guidelines. This {{is followed by the}} division of internal guidelines and a detailed analysis of each of them. The chapter is concluded by the importance of guidelines in the company and the formal form of the guidelines. A company may have a large number of guidelines, therefore only the most important ones were chosen in the particular company that are related to the most frequent accounting cases and are, for that reason, problematic. These are guidelines concerning the formation of the account classification, <b>incorporeal</b> and corporeal <b>property,</b> accrual basis of costs and profits, liability reserves, foreign currencies and travelling allowances...|$|R
5000|$|This {{limitation}} {{means that}} acts of common-law larceny cannot be committed against land [...] or items attached to or forming part of land, such as buildings, trees or shrubbery, crops {{growing in the}} field, or minerals. Acts of common law larceny cannot be committed against intangible things, such as love or affection, identity (identity theft {{is a type of}} fraud), or intellectual property, such as information and ideas. For example, if a person stole the Coca-Cola formula, the crime would be larceny but the grade of the offense would be determined by the value of the paper on which the formula was recorded not the value of the recipe. (Theft of trade secrets would be a different offense). Services and labor, as well as intangible personal <b>property</b> (<b>incorporeal</b> rights) such as contract rights and choses in action, wills, codicils, or other testamentary documents; wild animals [...] and items having no economic value [...] cannot be the subjects of acts of common-law larceny.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} {{an examination}} of choice of law rules in property. The study is principally concerned with the Scottish rules of international private law, but these, in turn, rely heavily upon, and in many respects are indistinguishable from, the equivalent English rules. Indeed, they seem in places to be mutually dependent. An examination is conducted of choice of law methodology, including in particular, {{an analysis of the}} configuration of choice of law rules. Consideration is given {{to the role of the}} connecting factor, and to the definition thereof, in its spatial, temporal and dimensional contexts. Throughout the thesis, a contrast is drawn between the jurisdiction-selecting approach of Scottish and English international private law, and the rule-selecting techniques which are employed in the United States of America. Central to the thesis is {{an examination of}} the role and definition of the connecting factor in the particular context of choice of law rules in property. The study traces the development of the lex situs rule, and its application to dealings with immovable property, corporeal moveable <b>property</b> and <b>incorporeal</b> moveable <b>property,</b> as well as the special case of dealings with 'cultural property'. Arguments in favour of, and against, the lex situs rule, in these various contexts, are considered, and special attention is paid to instances of latent and patent avoidance of the lex situs rule. In order to integrate the methodology analysis with the detailed study of choice of law in property, two alternative Models of suggested choice of law rules in property are presented for consideration; Model 1 is intended to be a draft international instrument, whereas Model 2, the more moderate proposal, is intended only as a draft national measure. The Models seek to embody the author's desire to inject a greater degree of flexibility into choice of law rules in property, and to attempt to formulate even-handed solutions to the complex problems (of space, time and policy) which arise in this area of the conflict of laws...|$|R
40|$|Law of tort, as it {{will appear}} in the pages below, has never been a front line subject in the eye of our propel. Litigants have not relied so much on this law and {{whenever}} they looked for remedy to their wrongs. This has not been the position in Pakistan alone, many other underdeveloped countries including India depict the same faint picture for its being considered as the law of less utility and negligible practice al importance. However, now the things are changing very quickly all over the underdeveloped world. The old trends are giving way to the new, and the to the ones. In Pakistan the number of tort cases is on the rese, though in an extremely allow fashion, some suggestions for improvement in the law of tort have been made, in the last chapter of this thesis. There are ten chapters in total. Chapter I is important since it gives to reader, quite an information about origin and history of law of tort in the indo-Pakistan sub-continent. The historical goes back to the earlier position of tort in England and its arrival in that country. Tort is defined explained in this chapter and general principles have also been discussed in some detail there. The purpose and end of law of tort as the protection of the rights to person, property and reputation are included in chapter III relates to the developments of law of tort in Pakistan. Chapter Iv is explicit like other chapters to follow. In these chapter legal concepts, such as, trespass, trespasses to proper (including trespass to <b>incorporeal</b> <b>property)</b> are discussed. In chapter v the topic â€˜Defamationâ€™ has been fully laid bare. The study has been made with reference to section 499 of Pakistan penal code. Defenses available to an action for defamation are also explained in some detail there. Negligence is discussed in chapter VI. In this chapter it has been seen that duty to take care is primarily fixed by law, and that the breach of that duty to take care can be the cause of damage to the plaintiff. In this regard the law is the law of the classical case of donoghue v. Stevenson (1932), but the defendant will not be held responsible for the loss to the plaintiff if the consequence were unforeseeable. In the same chapter VI, a very useful maxim of law (tree ipsa loquitur) has been applied in helping the plaintiff, who cannot prove to the full, the accident in question. In such a situation negligence is presumed against the defendant who must pay compensation to the plaintiff if he (defendant) was unable to rebut the presumption against him. Chapter VII is about nuisance which may be private or public depending upon who is subjected to annoyance and discomfort. Public nuisance can be in the form of smoke, stench, noise, atomic radiation, or the water polluted by industrial refuse. This branch of tort has altered many who are fighting pollution and try hard towards the protection of environment. Private nuisance is a tort, whereas public nuisance is not until the individual can prove special damage to him. Chapter VIII relates to vicarious liability. It is seen that not only is the private employer held liable for the torts of his servants, but that the state no more enjoys exemption from liability if a servant commits a tortuous act, within the couse of employment, there are statutory laws binding the employer of today to go out of the way pay compensation to the suffering workman. Liability in such a situation is strict because most often the employer is faultless altogether. Chapter IX relates to the application of law of tort in Pakistan. Though at present tort actions are minimal in numbers, yet some healthy changes are expected to take place in the time to come. Chapter X is the last of all in this thesis. This chapter refers to conclusions and suggestions. Among other things, it is suggested that the court-fee should be decreased to cause more cases to be entertained in the courts. It has been desired that lawyers must take on themselves the responsibility of educators of litigants from all walks of life, to enable them to start right actions including actions for recovery of damages for the injuries sustained...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present article was to argue {{the participation of the}} indian {{in the formation of the}} cultural identity of the Brazilian society, considering mainly its cultural production and the changes in the legislation how much to the protection and consolidation of politics that assure the social and cultural diversity. For the accomplishment of the displayed objective a bibliographical research was effected. The research in the verification of the application of the copyrights in the peculiar case of the Brazilian aboriginal peoples from a questioning on the difficulties faced for the jurists to take this clarification to the communities. As a focus was the quarrel regarding the relevance of the application of the copyrights as half to assure the aboriginal cultural identity, associating: copyrights, the importance of the protection to the traditional knowledge and the relevance of the <b>register</b> of the <b>incorporeal</b> patrimony of the aboriginal culture. As results we verify that while the formularization of a more complete law is waited and specific that has led, in consideration, the main peculiarities of the aboriginal peoples, the Brazilian population must extend its social vision regarding the native cultures in order to brighten up the politics of homogenization of the society. The studied authors demonstrate the absence in the legal system of a special protection to the traditional knowledge, becoming necessary that the professional of the right opts to adapting the legislation of copyright to these cases...|$|R
