40|$|The United Nations have {{established}} eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) during the Millennium Summit in 2000. Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger before 2015 {{has been the}} first of them. To achieve these goals, funding has been provided by several foundations and International Organizations such as the International Found for Agriculture and Development (IFAD). Goat activities are considered pathway out of poverty for poor smallholder farmers {{in the developing world}} and many projects have been implemented to promote goat raising. Unfortunately, references to scale up their successful factors are still very scarce and many projects were failures by lack of references, basic initial information, and business planning. The present study has been realized for IFAD to scale up and transfer successful practices and know –how on projects involving goats. A comparative analysis of more than 12 significant cases all over the world has been realized to scale up the successful factors on sustainable pro-poor small ruminant development projects. Dairy, meat and fiber commodities have been considered. By using Knowledge Harvesting methodology and exchanges with experts and actors involved in the several projects, the context of each case and the actors system have been described as well as the main productions systems. For each situation, Strong and Weak internal points, external Opportunities or Threats (SWOT) have been identified and discussed within two working group meetings and one seminar. After these general considerations on goat production systems and commodities, a typology based the possible objectives of each project has been built. The most accurate investments for each type are described and a methodology is proposed to choose them and how to monitor the implementation of each project. A special focus has been on the importance on the Goat Value Chain and a full Goat Value Chain specific tool kit has been prepared to support operationally the project leaders. A cost–benefits analysis evaluating the Investment <b>Return</b> <b>Rates</b> (<b>IRR)</b> and based on the studied cases has been realized by a FAO agro-economist expert. This collective project has shown that by using simple tools and indicators, it is possible to monitor professionally the development projects by minimizing the risks of failure. Besides, it confirmed that the development of livestock by small holders can be in many cases profitable and economically, environmentally and socially sustainable solutions for many territories. The organization of a competitive intelligence and information system is necessary in these specific situations for a better governance of development projects...|$|R

Os projetos analisados foram: heveicultura, eucalipto e pinus para produção de borracha, celulose e resina, respectivamente. O Valor Presente Líquido (VPL), a Taxa Interna de Retorno (TIR), o Valor Esperado da Terra (VET) e o Valor Anual Equivalente (VAE) foram os indicadores utilizados na avaliação financeira, a uma taxa de desconto de 10 % ao ano. Os resultados deste trabalho indicaram que, com esta taxa, os projetos de eucalipto e pinus foram viáveis sem os recursos adicionais dos CERs (Certificados de Emissões Reduzidas), ressaltando-se que a inclusão dos créditos de carbono propiciou aumento da viabilidade financeira destes. Já o projeto da heveicultura mostrou-se viável apenas com os Certificados de Carbono. A receita advinda da venda dos CERs aumentou consideravelmente a viabilidade financeira dos três projetos, mesmo considerando a tonelada de CO 2 a US$ 3, 00. Caso o Protocolo de Kyoto seja ratificado, haverá um incremento no preço pago pela tonelada de CO 2, que ocasionará o aumento da contribuição dos CERs em projetos florestais. The {{objective}} of the present work was to study the influence of carbon credits on the financial viability of three forest projects.

The physical and mechanical properties (tensile strength, modulus, and elongation at break) of rubber dipping products such as condom, gloves, and sphygmomanometer are not only found to the requirement of ISO 4074, ISO 10282, and ANSI/AAMI SP- 1994 standards, but also the allergic response tested clinical latex-sensitive protein allergen by ELISA test on gloves, and by SPT test on condom are found to be negative. It indicates that production of INRL or PVNRL or RVNRL by EBM 250 keV/ 10 mA, was more cheap than by using gamma γ irradiator 200 kCi, or sulfur vulcanization. The value of PBP (payback period) was 2, 1 years, NPV (net present value) was 4, 250 US $, PI (profitability index) 1, 06 and <b>IRR</b> (internal <b>rate</b> of <b>returns)</b> was 25, 0 %...|$|R
50|$|OCZ-branded SSDs were {{notable for}} high failure rates. Two {{lines from the}} old OCZ Technology Group, the Petrol and the SATA II {{versions}} of the Octane, had <b>return</b> <b>rates</b> of over 40% at one anonymous French technology online retailer. The SATA II version of the 128 GB Octane had a <b>return</b> <b>rate</b> of 52.07%. No other company had any SSDs with a <b>return</b> <b>rate</b> of over 5% from this retailer in the data set that was published on March 5, 2013. In a dataset published on April 30, 2014, OCZ again had the highest <b>return</b> <b>rates</b> from the same anonymous retailer. The next dataset, published on November 6, 2014, shows only one OCZ drive, the OCZ Agility 3 480 GB, which had a much lower <b>return</b> <b>rate</b> of 1.34%.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we use replica {{analysis}} {{to investigate the}} influence of correlation among the <b>return</b> <b>rates</b> of assets on {{the solution of the}} portfolio optimization problem. We consider the behavior of the optimal solution for the case where the <b>return</b> <b>rate</b> is described with a single-factor model and compare the findings obtained from our proposed methods with correlated <b>return</b> <b>rates</b> with those obtained with independent <b>return</b> <b>rates.</b> We then analytically assess the increase in the investment risk when correlation is included. Furthermore, we also compare our approach with analytical procedures for minimizing the investment risk from operations research. Comment: 4 pages, no figur...|$|R

30|$|The {{decisions}} regarding facility locations and capacity equipment are robust for low <b>return</b> <b>rates.</b> From <b>return</b> <b>rates</b> of 40 % remanufacturing takes place, if remanufacturing costs are sufficiently low. Moreover, for high <b>return</b> <b>rates,</b> rates of 80 % and more, the facility location decisions {{and the distribution}} system are changed compared to the results for lower rates. Therefore, the forward and reverse product flows in the network have to be planned together.|$|R

40|$|AIM: The authors {{report a}} {{retrospective}} study on surgical treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). Surgical approaches by Videoassisted axillary mini-thoracothomy (VAMT) and three-port VATS (t-VATS) are compared. Mean post-operative stay (MPS) and ipsilateral recurrence <b>rate</b> (<b>IRR)</b> are assessed. Secondary endpoints were about complications, early post-operative pain {{and long term}} neurologic symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2009 to December 2011 we consecutively observed 85 cases of PSP. Treatment was represented by surgery in 52 patients: the approach was by VAMT in 39 instances and t-VATS in 13. Median follow up was 30 months. RESULTS: Patients submitted to surgery had a MPS of 6. 62 ± 1. 5 days for VAMT and 6. 69 ± 3. 4 days for t-VATS (p= 0, 94). The IRR was 0...|$|R
40|$|Data {{from the}} 1988 Chinese Household Income Project are {{analyzed}} to determine education <b>return</b> <b>rates</b> in urban People's Republic of China & {{the effects of}} China's economic reform during the 1980 s on individual income & education <b>return</b> <b>rates.</b> Findings reveal that education <b>return</b> <b>rates</b> were 3 %- 6 % during this period, which are substantially lower than those reported in other less-developed countries. Although individual income is much higher in the state sector than the collective sector, it is revealed that education <b>return</b> <b>rates</b> in both sectors are comparable. After considering China's economic reform, it is disclosed that educational <b>return</b> <b>rates</b> are 5 % higher in Guangdong province; subsequently, it is stated that China's economic reform has strongly benefited its coastal provinces. It is concluded that China's egalitarian income distribution policy must be discontinued for China to complete its transition from socialist to market economy. 7 Tables. J. W. Parke...|$|R
