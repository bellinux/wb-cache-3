40|$|In many European {{countries}} {{a traditional}} policy and legal {{response to an}} undesirable increase of <b>asylum</b> <b>applications</b> has been the change of asylum law and procedures.

In the period from 1992 to 2003 three major revisions of the Belgian asylum procedure were enacted. When speaking in absolute figures these changes resulted in a certain {{decrease in the number of}} <b>asylum</b> <b>applications</b> filed. However, upon a closer examination of the number of <b>asylum</b> <b>applications</b> per country of origin, the effects appeared to be quite differential.

Using a wide range of statistical models and approaches, the article reveals that <b>asylum</b> <b>applications</b> exert a negative effect on recognition rates, and recognition rates exert a positive effect on applications. However, despite their statistical significance, the effects are rather small and mostly related to between-country rather than within-country variation, which implies that they are of limited practical significance.

This paper surveys the trends in asylum seeking since the 1980 s and the literature that it has generated and it provides new regression estimates of the determinants of <b>asylum</b> <b>applications</b> up to the present. The key findings are first, that violence and terror can account for much of the variation across source countries and over time but it cannot fully explain the original surge in <b>asylum</b> <b>applications</b> during the 1980 s.
