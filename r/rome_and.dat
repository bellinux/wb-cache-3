40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the proper law under the <b>Rome</b> I Regulation <b>and</b> the <b>Rome</b> II Regulation <b>and</b> find out the {{differences}} and similarities between them.

The part Two {{is concerned with the}} history of creation, structure, and scope of the <b>Rome</b> I <b>and</b> <b>Rome</b> II Regulations. Parts Three and Four represent the core of this thesis. The part Three analyzes the proper law of contract under the <b>Rome</b> I Regulation <b>and</b> non- contractual obligations under the Rome II Regulation. It focuses on ascertaining of the applicable law for obligations, on limits of the proper law and other related questions. Part Four summarizes all knowledge.

5|$|In the 7th and 8th centuries, {{expanding}} Muslim conquests {{following the}} advent of Islam led to an Arab domination of the Mediterranean that severed political connections between that area and northern Europe, and weakened cultural connections between <b>Rome</b> <b>and</b> the Byzantine Empire. Conflicts involving authority in the church, particularly {{the authority of the}} Bishop of Rome finally culminated in the East–West Schism in the 11th century, splitting the Church into the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Earlier splits within the Church occurred after the Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council of Chalcedon (451). However, a few Eastern Churches remained in communion with <b>Rome,</b> <b>and</b> portions of some others established communion in the 15th century and later, forming what are called the Eastern Catholic Churches.|$|E
