40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{the characteristics of}} <b>route</b> <b>and</b> survey processing of a unique complex virtual environment both at the behavioral and brain levels. Prior to fMRI scanning, participants were trained to follow a <b>route</b> <b>and</b> to learn the spatial relationships between several places, acquiring both <b>route</b> <b>and</b> survey knowledge from a ground-level perspective. During scanning, snapshots of the environment were presented, and participants were required to either indicate the direction to take to follow the route (route task), or to locate unseen targets (survey task). Data suggest that <b>route</b> <b>and</b> survey processing are mainly supported by a common occipito-fronto-parieto-temporal neural network. Our {{results are consistent with}} those gathered in studies concerning the neural bases of route versus survey knowledge acquired either from different perspectives or in different environments. However, rather than arguing for a clear distinction between <b>route</b> <b>and</b> survey processing, “mixed” strategies are likely to be involved when both types of encoding take place in the same environment...|$|R
