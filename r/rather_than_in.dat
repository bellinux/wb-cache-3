In later centuries, the ruling princes from the House of Rurik preferred to settle in a fortified castle at a distance from their capital: <b>in</b> Vyshhorod <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> Kiev, <b>in</b> Smyadyn <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> Smolensk, <b>in</b> Kideksha <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> Suzdal, <b>in</b> Bogolyubovo <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> Vladimir.|$|R

5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} organisms have electron transport chains {{that differ}} from the much-studied mammalian enzymes described above. For example, plants have alternative NADH oxidases, which oxidize NADH in the cytosol <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the mitochondrial matrix, and pass these electrons to the ubiquinone pool. These enzymes do not transport protons, and, therefore, reduce ubiquinone without altering the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane.|$|E
