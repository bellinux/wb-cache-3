2500|$|The {{measurement}} of the impedance of devices and transmission lines is a practical problem in radio technology and other fields. Measurements of impedance may be carried out at one frequency, or the variation of device impedance over a range of frequencies may be of interest. The impedance may be measured or displayed directly in ohms, or other values related to impedance may be displayed; for example, in a radio antenna, the standing wave ratio or reflection coefficient may be more useful than the impedance alone. The {{measurement of}} impedance requires the {{measurement of the}} magnitude of voltage and current, and the phase difference between them. Impedance is often measured by [...] "bridge" [...] methods, similar to the direct-current Wheatstone bridge; a calibrated <b>reference</b> <b>impedance</b> is adjusted to balance off the effect of the impedance of the device under test.

40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} improvement of a gas-sensing system by digital correction techniques is discussed. The considered system {{operates as a}} vectorial impedance meter and performs impedance measurements of eight sensors arranged in an array in the frequency range 10 Hz- 15 MHz. The measurements of the chemical sensors' impedance is an innovative technique that allows highlighting different adsorption mechanisms taking place when the sensors are exposed to gases. Of course, impedance analyzers are commercially available, but they usually make measurements on only one device at time {{and they are very}} expensive. The proposed PC-based impedance analyzer is a versatile one and shows good performances for gas-sensing applications. A digital correction technique is used in this work to improve the impedance measurement accuracy of each channel of the gas-sensing system (eight sensors → eight channels), in order to compensate for the conditioning electronics response. The latter is evaluated in a characterization procedure. A linear black box two-port model is used to take into account crosstalk, amplitude, and phase distortions.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{microwave}} filters starts from the derivation of a defined lowpass prototype network. A general lossy synthesis method is given which can 1) derive the reflection function from {{the transfer function}} when the unitary condition is not satisfied; 2) find the expressions for the complex admittance parameters and 3) synthesize the lossy coupling matrix (CM) with prescribed loss distributions. Two special cases are discussed for solving the refection function from a prescribed transfer function. An alternative approach to cope with loss is studied. In a transversal array, some resonators can be replaced by their low-Q alternatives to reduce the manufacture cost {{as well as the}} cavity size. The exact values for the dissipations of resonators or couplings can be determined analytically or by methods of gradient based optimizations. A method of CM synthesis with non-ideal load is given which can be used in designing diplexers or multiplexers. Filter networks matching to complex load impedances can be found by renormalizing <b>reference</b> <b>impedances.</b> An iteration method is introduced which can deal with frequency variant load and can deliver the required reflection zeros. A method for the synthesis of directional filters is presented which can be used for designing combiners. While each section of directional filters provides a 1 st order response, more complex filter characteristics can be realized by cascading those single sections. By proper transformations, directional filter networks can be realized using normal resonators and couplings. An example utilizing coaxial resonator is given. A method for the analysis of 2 -D lumped element networks is presented. The method is based on the general telegrapher’s equations of multi-wire transmission lines. A 2 -D lumped element network is equivalent to a combination of sub-networks which support single mode propagations.

Five healthy volunteers in seated and supine positions were asked to blow into a manometer in order to induce significant SV decreases. Time-scale analysis was applied on calibrated RIP signals to extract cardiac volume signals. Averaged SV values, in quasi-stationary states at rest and during the respiratory maneuvers, were then estimated from these cardiac signals and from IMP signals simultaneously acquired.

40|$|The {{spectral}} analysis {{and the concept}} of input impedance are used to develop a wave propagation model for a TDR measurement system that can account for dielectric dispersion of the material and non-uniform nature of the transmission line. The numerical procedure of the wave propagation model is relatively simple and becomes a powerful tool for parametric studies, data interpretations, and inverse analyses. The dielectric permittivity, the <b>reference</b> characteristic <b>impedance,</b> and the length of each uniform section characterize a non-uniform transmission line. Results indicate that inversion of these three parameters will result in definite non-uniqueness, but uniqueness can be achieved when one of the three parameters is known. The inversion of impedance profile from TDR waveforms with known dielectric properties can be used for data interpretation of rock and soil deformation; while the inversion of dielectric spectrum from TDR waveforms with known impedance can be used to study soil dielectric properties...|$|R

50|$|SWR {{can also}} be {{measured}} using an impedance bridge circuit. The bridge is balanced (0 volts across the detector) only when the test impedance exactly matches the <b>reference</b> <b>impedance.</b> When a transmission line is mismatched (SWR > 1:1), its input impedance deviates from its characteristic impedance; thus, a bridge {{can be used to}} determine {{the presence or absence of}} a low SWR.|$|E
50|$|To {{test for}} a match, the <b>reference</b> <b>impedance</b> {{of the bridge}} is set to the {{expected}} load impedance (for example, 50 ohms), and the transmission line connected as the unknown impedance. RF power {{is applied to the}} circuit. The voltage at the line input represents the vector sum of the forward wave, and the wave reflected from the load. If the characteristic impedance of the line is known to be 50 ohms, we know the magnitude and phase of the forward wave; it is the same wave present {{on the other side of}} the detector. Subtracting this known wave from the wave present at the line input yields the reflected wave. Properly designed, a bridge circuit can be used not only to indicate a match, but the degree of mismatch - thus making it possible to calculate the SWR. This usually involves alternately connecting the reference wave and the reflected wave to a power meter, and comparing the magnitudes of the resulting deflections.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a direct}} {{synthesis}} approach is proposed for designing a Chebyshev filter {{that matches the}} frequency variant complex loads at both the ports. The approach {{is based on the}} power wave renormalization theory and two practical assumptions: 1) the prescribed transmission zeros are stationary and 2) the reflection zeros are located along an imaginary axis. Three conditions are derived to stipulate the characteristic polynomials of the filter's responses through the renormalization of <b>reference</b> load <b>impedances.</b> These conditions are sequentially applied to ensure that the filter is physically realizable and well matched to the complex loads. It has been shown that the optimally synthesized filtering network that consists of an ideal filter cascaded with a piece of transmission line of an optimal length at each port can match the complex loads over a given frequency band with the best effort.

40|$|An error {{analysis}} which applies to both conventional and remote <b>reference</b> magnetotelluric <b>impedance</b> and tipper estimates is developed {{based on the}} assumption that noise in the field measurements is governed by a complex normal distribution. Under the assumed model of noise it is shown that the theoretical expressions for the variances and covariances derived recently by Gamble et al (1979 b) specifically for remote reference estimates apply to conventional estimates as well. However, calculations are biased if the impedance or tipper functions are biased. The impedance and tipper functions are calculated as ratios of two random functions of noisy field measurements. The expressions for the variances and covariances account for noise in both the numerator and denominator of the estimates. They are useful provided the probability that the magnitude of the random error in the denominator exceeds the magnitude of its expected value is small. Expressions for the bias errors of the impedance and tipper functions are obtained in order to assess the relative contributions of random and bias errors to the man squared error of the estimates. The relative magnitude of both random and bias errors depends on the noise level and on the values of the sample coherencies between various pairs of the field measurements used to compute a particular estimate...|$|R
