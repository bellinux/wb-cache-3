40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the process of}} a job-specific workers' health surveillance (WHS) in improving occupational health care for construction workers. From January to July 2012 were 899 bricklayers and supervisors invited for the job-specific WHS at three locations of one occupational health service throughout the Netherlands. The intervention aimed at detecting signs of work-related health problems, reduced work capacity and/or reduced work functioning. Measurements were obtained using a <b>recruitment</b> <b>record</b> and questionnaires at baseline and follow-up. The process evaluation included the following: reach (attendance rate), intervention dose delivered (provision of written recommendations and follow-up appointments), intervention dose received (intention to follow-up on advice directly after WHS and remembrance of advice three months later), and fidelity (protocol adherence). The workers scored their increase in knowledge from 0 - 10 with regard to health status and work ability, their satisfaction with the intervention and the perceived (future) effect of such an intervention. Program implementation {{was defined as the}} mean score of reach, fidelity, and intervention dose delivered and received. Reach was 9 % (77 workers participated), fidelity was 67 %, the intervention dose delivered was 92 and 63 %, and the intervention dose received was 68 and 49 %. The total programme implementation was 58 %. The increases in knowledge regarding the health status and work ability of the workers after the WHS were graded as 7. 0 and 5. 9, respectively. The satisfaction of the workers with the entire intervention was graded as 7. 5. The perceived (future) effects on health status were graded as 6. 3, and the effects on work ability were graded with a 5. 2. The economic recession affected the workers as well as the occupational health service that enacted the implementation. Programme implementation was acceptable. Low reach, limited protocol adherence and modest engagement of the workers with respect to the intervention were the most prominent aspects that influenced the intervention process. The increase in the workers' knowledge about their health status and work ability was substantial, and the workers' satisfaction with the intervention was good. The perceived effect of the advised preventive actions on health status was sufficient. Netherlands Trial Register: [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the recruitment, {{eligibility}} screening, and enroll-ment of African American and White smokers into an intensive smoking cessation intervention trial [The Chicago STOP Smoking Trial (C-STOP) ]. Methods: We compared demographic, smoking, substance use, and medical/psychiatric screening data from the <b>recruitment</b> <b>records</b> of 1, 189 non-Hispanic, African American and White smokers screened for eligibility in the last year of a randomized pharmacological and behavioral smoking cessation trial. The study took place at a large urban medical center and two satellite locations within the Chicago metropolitan area. Results: Interest levels in the study were high among African American smokers, with twice as many African Americans as Whites contacting study staff for information and an initial screening. However, African Americans were nearly three times as likely not to be enrolled in the trial as Whites, because of higher ineligibility rates, failure to attend a screening session, and lower participation rates even among those meeting eligibility requirements. Conclusions: Racial differences were observed nearly at all levels of enrollment determination. These critical barriers to inclusion of African Americans in smoking cessation research limit our understanding of treatment efficacy and ultimately the ability to reduce the health disparities in tobacco-related disease experienced by African Americans...|$|R
40|$|Water flow is an {{important}} characteristic determining the settlement and growth of macroinvertebrates in the marine environment. Intake systems of coastal power stations offer {{a unique opportunity to}} study the effect of water flow on benthic organisms under field conditions. The cooling water intake system of a tropical coastal power station is used as an experimental facility to study the effect of flow on the recruitment and growth of three mussel species, viz, Brachidontes variabilis, B. striatulus, and Modiolus philippinarum. The study was prompted by earlier observation that these mussels were numerically abundant in the biofouling community present inside the seawater intake tunnel of the power station, even though their occurrence in the benthic community in the coastal waters outside was only nominal. Recruitment data showed that the three mussel species very successfully colonised surfaces exposed to the intake mouth (characterised by relatively high flow) of the power station. Significant difference was observed in the <b>recruitment</b> <b>recorded</b> at the intake point and the ambient environment outside. Under high flow condition, the growth rates of all the three mussel species were uniformly enhanced. It is argued that recruitment of the different species is related to the number of byssus threads produced by each mussel and the strength of the byssus threads. The results indicate that byssus number and byssus strength of the mussels are important criteria that decide successful colonization and establishment in high flow environment...|$|R

Objectives 1) To conduct a process evaluation {{in order to identify}} the degree of implementation fidelity and associated barriers and facilitators. 2) To evaluate the primary intended impact of the programme: participation in fall prevention strategies, and the factors influencing participation. 3) To identify the factors influencing RESPOND RCT outcomes: falls, fall injuries and ED re-presentations. Methods/ Design Five hundred and twenty eight community-dwelling adults aged 60 – 90 years presenting to two EDs with a fall will be recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention or standard care group. All RESPOND participants and RESPOND clinicians will be included in the evaluation. A mixed methods design will be used and a programme logic model will frame the evaluation. Data will be sourced from interviews, focus groups, questionnaires, clinician case notes, <b>recruitment</b> <b>records,</b> participant-completed calendars, hospital administrative datasets, and audio-recordings of intervention contacts. Quantitative data will be analysed via descriptive and inferential statistics and qualitative data will be interpreted using thematic analysis.

Aim: To explore views of hospice patients, carers and clinical staff about whether videoing patient–doctor consultations is acceptable {{for research and}} training purposes. Design: We used semi-structured group and individual interviews to gather hospice patients, carers and clinical staff views. We used Braun and Clark’s thematic analysis. Setting/participants: Interviews were conducted at one English hospice to inform {{the development of a}} larger video-based study. We invited patients with capacity to consent and whom the care team judged were neither acutely unwell nor severely distressed (11), carers of current or past patients (5), palliative medicine doctors (7), senior nurses (4) and communication skills educators (5). Results: Participants viewed video-based research on communication as valuable because of its potential to improve communication, care and staff training. Video-based research raised concerns including its potential to affect the nature and content of the consultation and threats to confidentiality; however, these were not seen as sufficient grounds for rejecting video-based research. Video-based research was seen as acceptable and useful providing that measures are taken to reduce possible risks across the <b>recruitment,</b> <b>recording</b> and dissemination phases of the research process. Conclusion: Video-based research is an acceptable and worthwhile way of investigating communication in palliative medicine.
