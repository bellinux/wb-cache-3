25|$|This {{is one of}} {{the reasons}} that scuba <b>regulators</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} constructed from brass, and chrome plated (for protection). Brass, with its good thermal conductive properties, quickly conducts heat from the surrounding water to the cold, newly decompressed air, helping to prevent icing up.|$|E
25|$|Most {{contemporary}} diving <b>regulators</b> <b>are</b> single-hose two-stage regulators. They {{consist of}} a first-stage regulator, and a second-stage demand valve. An intermediate-pressure hose connects these components to transfer air, and allows relative movement within the constraints of hose length and flexibility. Other intermediate-pressure hoses supply optional additional components.|$|E
25|$|Reclaim <b>regulators</b> <b>are</b> also {{sometimes}} used for hazmat diving {{to reduce the}} risk of backflow through the exhaust valves into the helmet. In this application there would not be an underpesssure flood valve, but the pressure differences and the squeeze risk are relatively low.|$|E

25|$|Quiescent {{current in}} a {{regulator}} circuit {{is the current}} drawn internally, not available to the load, normally measured as the input current while no load is connected and hence a source of inefficiency (some linear <b>regulators</b> <b>are,</b> surprisingly, more efficient at very low current loads than switch-mode designs because of this).|$|E
25|$|Electronic voltage <b>regulators</b> <b>are</b> {{found in}} {{devices such as}} {{computer}} power supplies where they stabilize the DC voltages used by the processor and other elements. In automobile alternators and central power station generator plants, voltage regulators control {{the output of the}} plant. In an electric power distribution system, voltage regulators may be installed at a substation or along distribution lines so that all customers receive steady voltage independent of how much power is drawn from the line.|$|E
25|$|Speculation {{in stocks}} {{is a risky}} and complex {{occupation}} because {{the direction of the}} markets are generally unpredictable and lack transparency, also financial <b>regulators</b> <b>are</b> sometimes unable to adequately detect, prevent and remediate irregularities committed by malicious listed companies or other financial market participants. In addition, the financial markets are usually subjected to speculation.

25|$|The River Rother {{is managed}} by the Environment Agency to {{mitigate}} flooding in the Catcliffe and Rotherham areas, {{through a series of}} regulators and washlands. The <b>regulators</b> <b>are</b> used to hold back the flow of the river, and the washlands consist of low-lying land adjacent to the river which flood when the flows are held back. This allows flood flows on the River Don to pass through Rotherham before the water from the Rother does so. There are three regulators, at Canklow, Woodhouse Mill and Meadowgate.|$|E
25|$|Switching {{regulators}} rapidly switch {{a series}} device on and off. The duty {{cycle of the}} switch sets how much charge is transferred to the load. This is controlled by a similar feedback mechanism as in a linear regulator. Because the series element is either fully conducting, or switched off, it dissipates almost no power; this is what gives the switching design its efficiency. Switching <b>regulators</b> <b>are</b> also able to generate output voltages which are higher than the input, or of opposite polarity — something not possible with a linear design.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} regulator adjusts and controls the gas {{pressure in the}} cuff bladder. Older, non-computerized tourniquet systems utilize valves that attempt to respond mechanically to changes in pressure. For example, if pressure in the cuff bladder falls, a valve may open to allow more gas to enter the regulator from the gas source; if pressure exceeds a certain level, the pressure may force a release valve to open and expel gas into the environment. Sometimes, the pressure levels at which these two valves turn on and off are quite different and cuff pressure may fluctuate within a certain range {{above and below the}} selected pressure. Due to the sensitive mechanical components of these systems, {{it is very important to}} follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding frequent testing, and calibration and to perform these checks before each surgical procedure as recommended. In general, tourniquet systems with mechanical <b>regulators</b> <b>are</b> now considered to be inaccurate, unreliable, and are not suitable for incorporation with modern tourniquet safety features.|$|E

25|$|The severe floods of 2007 {{were the}} result of some 80 million cubic metres of {{rainfall}} falling on South Yorkshire on 25 June 2007. The level of the River Rother at Rotherham reached the highest level ever recorded, at , and the regulators were manned 24 hours a day in order to manage the water. However, there was a power failure at Canklow regulator, and the site had to be evacuated due to the threat posed by the possible breaching of the dam at Ulley Reservoir. The Meadowgate regulator was closed, and resulted in all four of the Rother Valley Country Park lakes flooding within the next 12 hours. Most of the car park and the watersports centre was also flooded, but water levels dropped over the next three days and little damage was caused. Assessment following those floods has led the Environment Agency to conclude that the <b>regulators</b> <b>are</b> expensive to maintain, and that they should be removed once some of the flood banks have been remodelled to ensure that the washlands fill and empty at the correct levels in a flood cycle.|$|E
25|$|As gas {{leaves the}} {{cylinder}} it decreases in {{pressure in the}} first stage, becoming very cold due to adiabatic expansion. Where the ambient water temperature is less than 5°C any water {{in contact with the}} regulator may freeze. If this ice jams the diaphragm or piston spring, preventing the valve closing, a free-flow may ensue that can empty a full cylinder within a minute or two, and the free-flow causes further cooling in a positive feedback loop. Generally the water that freezes is in the ambient pressure chamber around a spring that keeps the valve open and not moisture in the breathing gas from the cylinder, but that is also possible if the air is not adequately filtered. The modern trend of using plastics to replace metal components in regulators encourages freezing because it insulates the inside of a cold regulator from the warmer surrounding water. Some <b>regulators</b> <b>are</b> provided with heat exchange fins in areas where cooling due to air expansion is a problem, such as around the second stage valve seat on some regulators.|$|E
25|$|Wheat {{normally}} needs between 110 and 130 days between sowing and harvest, {{depending upon}} climate, seed type, and soil conditions (winter wheat lies dormant during a winter freeze). Optimal crop management {{requires that the}} farmer have a detailed understanding of each stage of development in the growing plants. In particular, spring fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, and growth <b>regulators</b> <b>are</b> typically applied only at specific stages of plant development. For example, it is currently recommended that the second application of nitrogen is best done when the ear (not visible at this stage) is about 1cm in size (Z31 on Zadoks scale). Knowledge of stages {{is also important to}} identify periods of higher risk from the climate. For example, pollen formation from the mother cell, and the stages between anthesis and maturity are susceptible to high temperatures, and this adverse effect is made worse by water stress. Farmers also benefit from knowing when the 'flag leaf' (last leaf) appears, as this leaf represents about 75% of photosynthesis reactions during the grain filling period, and so should be preserved from disease or insect attacks to ensure a good yield.|$|E
