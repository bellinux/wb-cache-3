40|$|We {{investigate}} a household’s asset allocation, housing, and mortgage decisions in a calibrated life-cycle model with costly stock market entry and participation and a risky housing market featuring housing adjustment costs, mortgage collateral borrowing requirement, refinancing charge, and default penalty. Our analysis demonstrates that a household’s liquid wealth {{is the most}} important determinant of both home and stock ownership. Our model can generate empirically documented hump-shaped life–cycle home and stock ownership patterns as well as explaining the negative (positive) effect of housing (mortgage) position on stock market participation and overall equity exposure. Extensive comparative static analysis suggests that ignoring mortgage <b>refinancing</b> <b>cost</b> and default option introduces significant biases in stock market participation rates and overall stockholdings...|$|E

In this paper, we explore risk premia in the covered bond market and particularly investigate {{whether and how}} credit risk is priced. In extant literature, yield spreads between high-quality covered bonds and government bonds are often interpreted as pure liquidity premia. In contrast, we show that although liquidity is important, {{it is not the}} exclusive risk factor.

40|$|This paper employs {{individual}} bidding data {{to analyze}} the empirical performance of the longer term refinancing operations (LTROs) of the European Central Bank (ECB). We investigate how banks ’ bidding behavior is related {{to a series of}} exogenous variables such as collateral costs, interest rate expectations, market volatility and to individual bank characteristics like country of origin, size, and experience. Panel regressions reveal that bidding strategies depend on the banks’ attributes. Yet, different bidding behavior generally does not translate into differences concerning bidder success. In particular, lower <b>refinancing</b> <b>cost</b> are usually associated with lower cover to bid ratios. In contrast to the ECB’s main refinancing operations we find evidence for the winner’s curse effect in LTROs indicating that banks ’ demand for longer term refinancing crucially depends on common market conditions...|$|E

These market indicators comprise bank <b>refinancing</b> <b>costs</b> and bank growth rates. In other words, two specific questions are addressed: (1) Do differences in bank exit regimes of significance to bank creditors explain differences in bank <b>refinancing</b> <b>costs?</b> (2) Do differences in bank exit regimes significant to bank shareholders explain differences in bank growth?

In contrast, our analysis reveals that liquidity {{is the most}} important, but not the exclusive risk factor within the Pfandbrief market. We show that Pfandbrief yield spreads also depend {{on the quality of}} the issuer, the type of collateral, and the quality of the cover pool. In particular, it is surprising that the issuer’s default risk is priced considerably, even though Pfandbriefe are backed by high-quality mortgages or public-sector loans and a Pfandbrief default has never been occurred. Using recently published cover pool data, we also show that the quality of the cover assets is less relevant in a normal market environment, but important in times of financial turmoil.

40|$|While option-theoretic {{models are}} widely used in {{valuation}} of other fixed-income instruments, their applications for the valuation of mortgage-backed securities face challenges. Mortgages are explicitly written with a call option, which allows mortgagors to prepay their mortgages any time before the maturity. The magnitude and timing of exercising the prepayment options are not purely driven by economic factors, but also the mortgagor's individual preferences and personal behaviours. This brings difficulties to valuing mortgage-backed securities with conventional models. In this thesis we aim to explore the prepayment risk caused uncertainties in valuation of mortgage-backed securities. We start with empirically examining an option-theoretic model proposed by Kalotay, Yang and Fabozzi (2004). This model has special features to treat borrower heterogeneity and suboptimal exercises of the prepayment options. Based on the empirical results, we propose to employ linear prepayment functions to model borrower heterogeneity. The new MBS valuation model with the integration of linear prepayment functions is also tested with empirical data. Our results suggest that mortgages with different coupon rates have different refinancing tendencies even towards the same market rate change. Therefore, assuming the same refinancing pattern to all classes of mortgages may lead to errors in pricing mortgages and MBSs. For mortgages with coupon rate below the prevailing refinancing rate (as proxied by the 30 year libor rate) plus the <b>refinancing</b> <b>cost,</b> a prepayment function with a low initial prepayment rate and a high slope will model the prepayments best. On the other hand, for mortgages with coupon rate above the current refinancing rate plus the <b>refinancing</b> <b>cost,</b> a prepayment function with a high initial prepayment and a mild slope will perform best. Meanwhile, refinancing burnout {{is also an important}} factor in modelling mortgage prepayment. Our results suggest that when the underlying mortgages are seasoned mortgages, especially when the prepayment option has been deep-in-the-money for a long time, the low initial prepayment high slope function will model their prepayments the best. Once these different refinancing tendencies are factored in the modelling of mortgage prepayment, the accuracy of the MBS valuation model is greatly improved.

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{analytically}} tractable option pricing {{model of a}} mortgage holder’s optimal refinancing behavior. This reduces to the choice of an optimal interest rate differential. At this optimal differential, {{the value of the}} interest saved equals the sum of refinancing costs and the difference between the old ‘in the money ’ refinancing option that is implicitly given up at the refinancing and the new ‘out of the money ’ refinancing option that is implicitly acquired. For a reasonable range of parameter values, we calculate the differential to be bounded below by 100 basis points. Using a unique panel data set from a large financial institution, we find that during the 1990 s over half of refinancers did so at differentials of 100 basis points or fewer. We further estimate that the fraction of early refinancers in the whole population is on the order of 30 %. We conjecture that the pattern of early refinancing may arise because mortgage holders ignore the option value of waiting to refinance; rather, they choose to refinance {{at the point where the}} net present value of interest saved is equal to the <b>refinancing</b> <b>cost.</b> This behavior is consistent with the advice of most popular finance books and websites...|$|E

The {{first and second}} chapters study how enterprises access financial resources to finance their investment. The third chapter relates to international macroeconomics, analysing the effect of foreign exchange interventions on the exchange rate level. How do Chinese {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} manage to bypass financial constraints and invest, despite their limited access to formal bank loans? What is the impact of the recent banking sector reforms in China? In my first chapter, I show evidence of the crucial role played by alternative sources of funding - namely family, friends, non-listed equity and further informal institutions - in supplementing usual financing sources like bank loans and reinvested profits. I conclude that liberalizing the banking sector significantly increases steady-state aggregate production and capital levels. Tightening the regulation of the alternative finance sector remains detrimental to small, young enterprises, even if simultaneous to liberalizing the banking sector. The second chapter suggests a theoretical mechanism driving uctuations in the ability of newcomer enterprises to obtain financial resources for their investment projects. I examine the differentiated impact of a shock in commercial banks' <b>refinancing</b> <b>cost</b> on loan distribution, distinguishing among borrowers according to their previous loan history with the bank. Since loan officers have more information on incumbent borrowers than on newcomers, they may prioritize loans to incumbents against loans to newcomers, {{as a response to the}} shock. The last chapter (joint with G. Adler and R. C. Mano) studies the impact of foreign exchange intervention for a large panel of countries. We find robust evidence that foreign exchange intervention affects the level of the exchange rate in an economically meaningful way: a country purchasing (selling) its own domestic currency appreciates (depreciates) it. In addition, these effects are found to be quite persistent.

40|$|We {{show that}} the use of non-interest terms in bank loans is a way to {{maintain}} the borrowers 2 ̆ 7 flexibility to prepay freely. If voluntary prepayments are penalty-free, as widely observed for bank loans in practice, over time good borrowers prepay their loans while bad borrowers stay. This reclassification effect leaves the lender with bad borrowers only. Increasing the interest rate is not sufficient to compensate the lender for the prepayment risk, so the bank resorts to non-interest credit rationing. In addition to non-price instruments such as collateral, a non-linear pricing approach, in which the loan price is split into the interest and the upfront fee, can be employed. The model predicts that: higher loan prices and lower <b>refinancing</b> <b>costs</b> are associated with higher upfront fees; secured loans use higher upfront fees, but performance-sensitive loans use lower. Empirical evidence supports these predictions. Using a sample of 29, 510 term loans to U. S. firms between 1992 and 2011, we find that a 100 basis points increase in the loan spread leads to an average increase in the upfront fee by over 15 basis points.

Despite these reservations concerning the use of our model as a technique for absolute valuation, preliminary findings on the effects of changes in mortgage contract design on the value of the prepayment option are encouraging. For example, our estimate of the relative values of the call options on 30 - and 15 -year mortgages and on level-payment and graduated-payment mortgages appear to be reasonably robust with respect to specifications of the interestrate process and the other parameters. These findings suggest that our model may be of considerable use within the context of relative or comparative valuation. ...|$|R

Sweden, in particular, has seen indebtedness rise from 90 % of disposable income in 1995 to 172 % in 2014. The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) has identified mortgage amortization requirements as a potential instrument for reducing indebtedness; and has drafted guidelines that will intensify the rate and duration of amortization. In this paper, I characterize Swedish-style mortgage contracts, which differ substantially from U. S. -style contracts. I then evaluate the policy changes in an incomplete markets model with three types of debt and a novel mortgage contract specification that is calibrated to match Swedish micro and macro data. I find that intensifying the rate and duration of amortization is largely ineffective at reducing indebtedness in a realistically-calibrated model. In the absence of implausibly large <b>refinancing</b> <b>costs</b> or tight restrictions on the maximum debt-service-to-income ratio, the policy impact is small in aggregate, over the lifecycle, and across employment statuses.
