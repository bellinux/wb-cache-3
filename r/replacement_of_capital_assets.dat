40|$|Two {{alternative}} analytical {{models were}} used to estimate the economically optimal age of replanting date palm, namely; Comparison of Equivalent Annual Net Revenue (CEAN) and Multi-Period Linear Programming Model (MPLP). Solution procedures of both models {{are based on the}} theory of optimal <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>assets.</b> Data on date palm age-yield relationship and other socioeconomic variables were gleaned through a farm survey of 34 large commercial farms, in Izki, Bahla, and Al-Hamra wilayats in the Al- Dakhilya governorate of the Sultanate of Oman. The study estimated the optimal age of replanting date palms as 50 - 55 years. Both models, CEAN and MPLP gave consistent estimates. The optimal age to replant date palms was sensitive only to changes in the interest rates. Low interest rates shortened the optimal age of date palm replanting. Changes in date price, yield and variable production costs did not change the optimal age of replanting date palms. The incremental revenue that could be accrued to the Sultanate of Oman through replanting date palms was estimated as 7 million OR/ year...|$|E

The volume <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> in for profit organisations {{is limited by}} profitability criteria. Local municipalities are not for profit organisations where profitability criteria are subordinated. This paper investigates explanations of variation in development of the volume <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> in Swedish local municipalities between 1999 - 2008. In the first step four cases were performed to generate eight suggestions for explanations. Hypothesises were generated by combining the suggested explanations with a new political economy framework containing four assumptions. A national data set of 288 (of total 290) Swedish local municipalities was used in a multiple linear regression analysis. The regression model include five variables and explains 31 percentage of the variation. An increasing volume <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> {{could be explained by}} population growth, a high volume <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> per capita {{at the beginning of the}} period, high solidity at the beginning of the period, an increasing level of charges and high political stability with few majority changes.

40|$|In the {{literature}} of comprehensive national accounts, national net investments are used to indicate dynamic welfare improvement in an economy.
