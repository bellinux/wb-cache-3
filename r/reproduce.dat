40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [11222221]A {{consistently}} coupled isogeometric-meshfree {{method is}} presented. This method {{takes advantage of}} the geometry exactness of isogeometric analysis and the refinement flexibility of meshfree method. The coupling of isogeometric approximation and meshfree approximation is based upon the <b>reproducing</b> or consistency conditions which are crucial for the coupled method to achieve the expected optimal convergence rates. It is shown that unlike the <b>reproducing</b> kernel meshfree shape functions which satisfy the <b>reproducing</b> conditions with the nodal points as the <b>reproducing</b> locations, the monomial <b>reproducing</b> points for different orders of B-spline basis functions in isogeometric analysis are different and consequently a rational method is proposed to compute these <b>reproducing</b> points. Both theoretical proof and computational justification of the <b>reproducing</b> conditions for B-spline basis functions are given. Subsequently within the framework of <b>reproducing</b> conditions, a mixed <b>reproducing</b> point vector is proposed to ensure arbitrary order monomial reproducibility for both B-spline basis functions and <b>reproducing</b> kernel meshfree shape functions, which leads to a consistently coupled approximation with smoothing transition between B-spline basis functions and <b>reproducing</b> kernel meshfree shape functions. Consequently a coupled isogeometric-meshfree method is established with the Galerkin formulation. The effectiveness of the proposed coupled isogeometric-meshfree method is demonstrated through a series of benchmark numerical examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we solve support vector {{machines}} in <b>reproducing</b> kernel Banach spaces with <b>reproducing</b> kernels defined on nonsymmetric domains {{instead of the}} traditional methods in <b>reproducing</b> kernel Hilbert spaces. Using the orthogonality of semi-inner-products, we can obtain the explicit representations of the dual (normalized-duality-mapping) elements of support vector machine solutions. In addition, we can introduce the reproduction property in a generalized native space by Fourier transform techniques such that it becomes a <b>reproducing</b> kernel Banach space, which can be even embedded into Sobolev spaces, and its <b>reproducing</b> kernel is {{set up by the}} related positive definite function. The representations of the optimal solutions of support vector machines (regularized empirical risks) in these <b>reproducing</b> kernel Banach spaces are formulated explicitly in terms of positive definite functions, and their finite numbers of coefficients can be computed by fixed point iteration. We also give some typical examples of <b>reproducing</b> kernel Banach spaces induced by MatÃ©rn functions (Sobolev splines) so that their support vector machine solutions are well computable as the classical algorithms. Moreover, each of their <b>reproducing</b> bases includes information from multiple training data points. The concept of <b>reproducing</b> kernel Banach spaces offers us a new numerical tool for solving support vector machines. Comment: 26 page...|$|R
