25|$|In September 2012 Chrysler {{temporarily}} suspended {{a demonstration}} {{program that was}} conducting with 109 Dodge Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrids and 23 Chrysler Town & Country plug-in hybrids. All units deployed in the program were recalled due to damage sustained by three separate pickup trucks when their 12.9 kWh battery packs overheated. The carmaker plans to upgrade the battery packs with cells that use a different lithium-ion chemistry before the vehicles go back on service. Chrysler explained {{that no one was}} injured from any of the incidents, and the vehicles were not occupied at the time, nor any of the minivans were involved in any incident, but they were withdrawn as a precaution. The carmaker reported that the demonstration fleet had collectively accumulated 1.3 million miles (2.1 million km) before the vehicles were recalled. The demonstration is a program jointly funded by Chrysler and the U.S. Department of Energy that includes the first-ever factory-produced vehicles capable of <b>reverse</b> <b>power</b> flow. The experimental system would allow fleet operators to use their plug-in hybrids to supply electricity for a building during a power outage, reduce power usage when electric rates are high or even sell electricity back to their utility company.|$|E

500|$|A {{directional}} filter is {{a device that}} combines the functions of a directional coupler and a diplexer. [...] As {{it is based on}} a directional coupler it is essentially a four-port device, but like directional couplers, port 4 is commonly permanently terminated internally.

[...] In <b>reverse,</b> <b>power</b> entering ports 2 and 3 is combined at port 1, but now the power from the signals rejected by the filter is absorbed in the load at port 4. [...] Figure 15 shows one possible waveguide implementation of a {{directional filter}}. [...] Two rectangular waveguides operating in the dominant TE10 mode provide the four ports. [...] These are joined together by a circular waveguide operating in the circular TE11 mode. [...] The circular waveguide contains an iris coupled filter with as many irises as needed to produce the required filter response.|$|E

40|$|High {{levels of}} {{penetration}} of distributed generation and aggressive {{reactive power compensation}} with modern power electronics may result in the reversal of active and reactive power flows in future distribution grids. The voltage stability of these operating conditions may {{be very different from}} the more traditional power consumption regime. We study the stability characteristics of distribution networks with <b>reversed</b> <b>power</b> flow. After introducing a universal algebraic approach to characterize all the solutions of the power flow equations, we show that new solutions appear in the <b>reversed</b> <b>power</b> flow regime even in the simplest three bus systems. We show that the some of these solutions are stable and the system may exhibit a phenomenon of multistability, where multiple stable equilibria co-exist at the given set of parameters, and the system may converge to an undesirable equilibrium after a disturbance. These predictions are validated with dynamic simulations of two different systems. Under certain conditions the new states are viable and may be characterized by relatively high voltages. Possible approaches towards reactive power/voltage regulation as well as permissible distributed generation capacity in future power systems are proposed and discussed in the end of the paper.

Once installed {{it was found that}} the rear bearing was inaccessible and could not be repaired with the motor installed. It was difficult to inspect the armature or repair damage to the insulation. The motor was not designed to come to an immediate halt when power was disconnected, but instead would freewheel to a halt relatively slowly. <b>Reverse</b> <b>power</b> could not be applied until it had stopped moving, so it was not possible to immediately reverse the propeller in case of emergency. The motor proved so problematic that it was replaced with a smaller but more powerful Sautter-HarlÃ© motor.|$|E

50|$|According to the {{original}} bid submission a rural area of around 700km2 between Peterborough, March and Wisbech in Cambridgeshire has been chosen as the test bed for the Flexible Plug and Play project.

50|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>power</b> feeding (RPF) {{is a new}} {{technology}} being standardized by ETSI and the Broadband Forum TR-301. It allows sending power from the customer premises to a distribution point (DP), in order to power the distribution point unit (DPU). The DPU includes typically a DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM) that can support up to 24 users and an optical network terminator (ONT), which connects the DPU to a central office (CO) where the optical line terminator (OLT) is located. This topology as also known as fiber to the distribution point (FTTdp). RPF is a critical technology for the upgrade of VDSL2 subscribers to the new G.fast standard, which has a maximum range (at high speeds) of 250m. Given {{that only a small}} number of subscribers is located at a radius of 250m from a DPU, the number of DPUs required to deploy G.fast infrastructure greatly increases, compared to VDSL2 and older xDSL technologies. RPF reduces installation cost by removing the need to connect the DPU locally to the power grid, as well as the need to monitor its power consumption with a smart meter.|$|E

The top side {{is fed from}} multiple protectors and is always energized unless all units on a spot network are in the open position. Grid units will always be energized on the top side from the many other units tied into the grid.A spot network is 2 or more transformers dedicated to a single customer.

The components are enclosed in a protective housing; some network protectors are installed on transformers below grade and must be in water-resistant enclosures.

The controlling relay monitors voltage and current in the transformer, and opens or closes the contact mechanism through electrical signals.

Although New Mexico was refitted with geared turbines in a 1931-33 refit, the remaining turbo-electric ships retained the system throughout their careers. This system used two large steam turbine generators to drive an electric motor on each of four shafts. The system was less costly initially than reduction gears and made the ships more maneuverable in port, with the shafts able to reverse rapidly and deliver more <b>reverse</b> <b>power</b> than with most geared systems.
