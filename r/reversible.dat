5|$|Designing <b>reversible</b> {{rules for}} block {{cellular}} automata, and {{determining whether a}} given rule is <b>reversible,</b> is easy: for a block cellular automaton to be <b>reversible</b> it is necessary and sufficient that the transformation applied to the individual blocks at {{each step of the}} automaton is itself <b>reversible.</b> When a block cellular automaton is <b>reversible,</b> the time-reversed version of its dynamics can also be described as a block cellular automaton with the same block structure, using a time-reversed sequence of partitions of cells into blocks, and with the transition function for each block being the inverse function of the original rule.|$|E
5|$|<b>Reversible</b> {{cellular}} automata form {{a natural}} model of <b>reversible</b> computing, {{a technology that}} could lead to ultra-low-power computing devices. Quantum cellular automata, one way of performing computations using the principles of quantum mechanics, are often required to be <b>reversible.</b> Additionally, many problems in physical modeling, such as the motion of particles in an ideal gas or the Ising model of alignment of magnetic charges, are naturally <b>reversible</b> and can be simulated by <b>reversible</b> cellular automata.|$|E
5|$|As Boykett argues, any {{one-dimensional}} <b>reversible</b> {{cellular automaton}} {{is equivalent to}} an automaton in rectangular form, in which the cells are offset a half unit at each time step, and in which both the forward and reverse evolution of the automaton have neighborhoods with just two cells, the cells a half unit away in each direction. If a <b>reversible</b> automaton has neighborhoods larger than two cells, it can be simulated by a <b>reversible</b> automaton with smaller neighborhoods and more states per cell, in which each cell of the simulating automaton simulates a contiguous block of cells in the simulated automaton. The two axioms of a semicentral bigroupoid are exactly the conditions required on the forward and reverse transition functions of these two-cell neighborhoods to be the reverses of each other. That is, every semicentral bigroupoid defines a <b>reversible</b> cellular automaton in rectangular form, in which the transition function of the automaton uses the operation to combine the two cells of its neighborhood, and in which the operation similarly defines the reverse dynamics of the automaton. Every one-dimensional <b>reversible</b> cellular automaton is equivalent to one in this form.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the motion}} of the {{particles}} in these systems is <b>reversible,</b> they are typically implemented with <b>reversible</b> cellular automata. In particular, both the HPP and FHP lattice gas automata can be implemented with a two-state block cellular automaton using the Margolus neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|A <b>reversible</b> {{cellular}} automaton is a {{cellular automaton}} {{in which every}} configuration has a unique predecessor. That is, it is a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states, with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors, such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a <b>reversible</b> cellular automaton can always be described by another cellular automaton rule, possibly on a much larger neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|A <b>reversible</b> {{surgical}} method {{under investigation}} is <b>reversible</b> inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the vas deferens. An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the vas deferens to block it. A combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising, as do selective androgen receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E
5|$|All three {{reactions}} are <b>reversible.</b> Platinum(II) and platinum(IV) bromides {{are known as}} well. Platinum hexafluoride is a strong oxidizer capable of oxidizing oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Boykett {{used this}} {{algebraic}} formulation {{as the basis}} for algorithms that exhaustively list all possible inequivalent <b>reversible</b> cellular automata.|$|E
5|$|Competitive antagonists are sub-classified as <b>reversible</b> (surmountable) or {{irreversible}} (insurmountable) competitive antagonists, {{depending on}} how they interact with their receptor protein targets.|$|E
5|$|Many antagonists are <b>reversible</b> antagonists that, {{like most}} agonists, will bind and unbind a {{receptor}} at rates determined by receptor-ligand kinetics.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, both Capcom and Marvel {{announced}} that the game would include <b>reversible</b> packaging. The front cover art featured the work of Capcom illustrator Shinkiro, while the reverse side featured the art of Marvel Comics' Mark Brooks. Brook's alternate cover featured all twelve of the game's new characters in his own comic book style. Both pieces of art were printed on a single <b>reversible</b> cover for the entire first run of Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 in North America.|$|E
5|$|Replacing labile ligands such as H2O, H−, or CO {{directly}} by nitrogen: these are often <b>reversible</b> reactions that proceed at mild conditions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Reversible</b> inhibitors {{attach to}} enzymes with non-covalent {{interactions}} such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and ionic bonds. Multiple weak bonds between the inhibitor and the active site combine to produce strong and specific binding. In contrast to substrates and irreversible inhibitors, <b>reversible</b> inhibitors {{generally do not}} undergo chemical reactions when bound to the enzyme and can be easily removed by dilution or dialysis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Reversible</b> pulpitis is {{characterized}} by short-lasting pain triggered by cold and sometimes heat. The symptoms of <b>reversible</b> pulpitis may disappear, either because the noxious stimulus is removed, such as when dental decay is removed and a filling placed, or because new layers of dentin (tertiary dentin) have been produced inside the pulp chamber, insulating against the stimulus. Irreversible pulpitis causes spontaneous or lingering pain in response to cold.|$|E
5|$|Several {{general methods}} {{are known for}} {{constructing}} cellular automaton rules that are automatically <b>reversible.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first rhodocenium-containing {{side-chain}} polymers {{were prepared}} through controlled polymerization {{techniques such as}} <b>reversible</b> addition−fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT) and ring-opening metathesis polymerisation (ROMP).|$|E
5|$|The transit {{center is}} also located {{directly}} east of Interstate 5 and is near an access ramp to the freeway's <b>reversible</b> express lanes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} kinds of <b>reversible</b> enzyme inhibitors. They are {{classified}} {{according to the}} effect of varying the concentration of the enzyme's substrate on the inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|There are no nontrivial <b>reversible</b> {{elementary}} cellular automata. However, a near-miss {{is provided}} by Rule 90 and other elementary cellular automata based on the exclusive or function. In Rule 90, the state of each cell is the exclusive or of the previous states of its two neighbors. This use of the exclusive or makes the transition rule locally invertible, {{in the sense that}} any contiguous subsequence of states can be generated by this rule. Rule 90 is not a <b>reversible</b> cellular automaton rule, because in Rule 90 every assignment of states to the complete array of cells has exactly four possible predecessors, whereas <b>reversible</b> rules are required to have exactly one predecessor per configuration.|$|E
5|$|To {{use only}} those {{procedures}} and materials which were simple, extensively tested, not harmful, and <b>reversible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Any {{one-dimensional}} <b>reversible</b> {{cellular automaton}} may be placed into rectangular form, after which its transition rule may be factored into {{the action of}} an idempotent semicentral bigroupoid (a <b>reversible</b> rule for which regions of cells with a single state value change only at their boundaries) together with a permutation {{on the set of}} states. The first-order invariants for the idempotent lifting of the automaton rule (the modified rule formed by omitting the permutation) necessarily behave like the ones for a rectangular band: they have a basis of invariants that flow either leftwards or rightwards at a constant rate without interaction. The first-order invariants for the overall automaton are then exactly the invariants for the idempotent lifting that give equal weight to every pair of states that belong to the same orbit of the permutation. However, the permutation of states in the rule may cause these invariants to behave differently from in the idempotent lifting, flowing non-uniformly and with interactions.|$|E
5|$|As {{interactions}} between proteins are <b>reversible,</b> and depend {{heavily on the}} availability of different groups of partner proteins to form aggregates that are capable to carry out discrete sets of function, study of the {{interactions between}} specific proteins is a key to understand important aspects of cellular function, and ultimately the properties that distinguish particular cell types.|$|E
5|$|Asthma is {{a common}} {{long-term}} inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, <b>reversible</b> airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These episodes may occur {{a few times a}} day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, they may become worse at night or with exercise.|$|E
5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} is <b>reversible</b> in {{the early}} stages by use of break periods on lower pressures of oxygen, but it may eventually result in irreversible lung injury if allowed to progress to severe damage. One or two days of exposure without oxygen breaks are needed to cause such damage.|$|E
5|$|Cellular {{automaton}} {{models of}} this system divide the square lattice into two alternating subsets, and perform updates {{on one of the}} two subsets at a time. In each update, every cell that can flip does so. This defines a <b>reversible</b> cellular automaton which can be used to investigate the Ising model.|$|E
5|$|Congenital malformation, {{hereditary}} disorders, {{and acquired}} conditions can affect cerebellar structure and, consequently, cerebellar function. Unless the causative condition is <b>reversible,</b> {{the only possible}} treatment is to help people live with their problems. Visualization of the fetal cerebellum by ultrasound scan at 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy {{can be used to}} screen for fetal neural tube defects with a sensitivity rate of up to 99%.|$|E
5|$|Countries in boreal climates {{often need}} snow camouflage, either by having <b>reversible</b> uniforms or simple overgarments. Such simple overgarments {{can be used}} for other terrains too. The Austrian and Israeli armies use solid colour field uniforms, relying on simple overgarments for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors are {{molecules}} that reduce or abolish enzyme activity, while enzyme activators are {{molecules that}} increase the catalytic rate of enzymes. These interactions can be either <b>reversible</b> (i.e., removal of the inhibitor restores enzyme activity) or irreversible (i.e., the inhibitor permanently inactivates the enzyme).|$|E
5|$|For a block {{cellular}} automaton, testing reversibility is also easy: the automaton is <b>reversible</b> if {{and only}} if the transition function on the blocks of the automaton is invertible, and in this case the reverse automaton has the same block structure with the inverse transition function.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{criteria}} {{exist for}} each of the main subtypes of Guillain–Barré syndrome (AIDP and AMAN/AMSAN, see below), but these may misclassify some cases (particularly where there is <b>reversible</b> conduction failure) and therefore changes to these criteria have been proposed. Sometimes, repeated testing may be helpful.|$|E
5|$|Further, the Court {{disapproved of}} the judge's having asked the jury for the {{proportions}} of their deadlock (even {{though he did not}} ask how many were for conviction and how many were for acquittal). In Brasfield v. United States (1926), citing Burton, the Court held that such was <b>reversible</b> error, regardless of whether the defendant objected in the trial court.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is possibly}} <b>reversible</b> with treatment. This typically involves supportive care and addressing the triggers of the event. Lactulose is frequently used to decrease ammonia levels. Certain antibiotics and probiotics are other potential options. A liver transplant may improve outcomes {{in those with}} severe disease.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen sponge alloys {{can contain}} lanthanum. These alloys {{are capable of}} storing up to 400 times their own volume of {{hydrogen}} gas in a <b>reversible</b> adsorption process. Heat energy is released every time they do so; therefore these alloys have possibilities in energy conservation systems.|$|E
5|$|Hyperoxic myopia has {{occurred}} in closed circuit oxygen rebreather divers with prolonged exposures. It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This is due {{to an increase in}} the refractive power of the lens, since axial length and keratometry readings do not reveal a corneal or length basis for a myopic shift. It is usually <b>reversible</b> with time.|$|E
5|$|Inorganic iodides find {{specialised}} uses. Titanium, zirconium, hafnium, and thorium are purified by the van Arkel process, {{which involves}} the <b>reversible</b> {{formation of the}} tetraiodides of these elements. Silver iodide is a major ingredient to traditional photographic film. Thousands of kilograms of silver iodide are used annually for cloud seeding to induce rain.|$|E
5|$|Iron(III) {{chloride}} has {{a relatively}} low melting point and boils at around 315°C. The vapour consists of the dimer Fe2Cl6 (c.f. aluminium chloride) which increasingly dissociates into the monomeric FeCl3 (D3h point group molecular symmetry) at higher temperature, in competition with its <b>reversible</b> decomposition to give iron(II) chloride and chlorine gas.|$|E
