60|$|Verkimier fired instantly, the {{branches}} closed, and the monster moved off in another direction. In desperate anxiety Nigel fired both barrels of his shot-gun. He {{might as well}} have fired at the moon. Gurulam was armed only with a spear, and Van der Kemp, who was not much of a sportsman, carried a similar weapon.

6000|$|Further {{conversation}} {{was interrupted by}} howls from the <b>rear.</b> <b>Looking</b> round we saw Sam careering after us over the close-bitten turf, howling scorn and derision at us. [...] "Rabbit-tail, rabbit-tail," [...] he cried, his bare little legs twinkling, and his little shirt fluttering in the cold morning air. Fortunately, at last he trod on a thistle or a thorn, for when we looked round again to see why he was silent, he was capering on one leg, holding his wounded foot in his hands.|$|E

50|$|A {{photograph}} of this street {{was taken in}} 1838 by Louis Daguerre from high in his 350-seat Diorama Building at 4, Rue Sanson, where it intersected with the Rue des Marais, and which from the <b>rear</b> <b>looked</b> out roughly southwards over the rooftops towards Boulevard du Temple (since demolished, {{the place where it}} stood is at the south side of Rue Léon Jouhaux just off the north corner of Place de la République). The image is one of the earlier Daguerreotypes (invented 1837), and it is thus believed to be the earliest surviving photograph showing a person.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete vision sensor onboard a moving vehicle which collects the traffic data in its local area in daytime conditions. The sensor comprises a <b>rear</b> <b>looking</b> and a forward looking camera. Thus, a representative {{description of the}} traffic conditions in the local area of the host vehicle can be computed. The proposed sensor detects the number of vehicles (traffic load), their relative positions and their relative velocities in a four-stage process: lane detection, candidates selection, vehicles classification and tracking. Absolute velocities (average road speed) and global positioning are obtained after combining the outputs provided by the vision sensor with the data supplied by the CAN Bus and a GPS sensor. The presented experiments are promising in terms of detection performance and accuracy {{in order to be}} validated for applications {{in the context of the}} automotive industry...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a complete vision-based vehi-cle detection system for Floating Car Data (FCD) enhancement {{in the context}} of Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs). Three cameras (side, forward and <b>rear</b> <b>looking</b> cameras) are installed onboard a vehicle in a fleet of public buses. Thus, a more representative local description of the traffic conditions (extended FCD) can be obtained. Specifically, the vision modules detect the number of vehicles contained in the local area of the host vehicle (traffic load) and their relative velocities. Absolute velocities (average road speed) and global positioning are obtained after combining the outputs provided by the vision modules with the data supplied by the CAN Bus and the GPS sensor. This information is transmitted by means of a GPRS/UMTS data connection to a central unit which merges the extended FCD in order to maintain an updated map of the traffic conditions (traffic load and average road speed). The presented experiments are promising in terms of detection performance and computational costs. However, significant effort is further necessary before deploying a system for large-scale real applications. I...|$|E

50|$|This house {{began as}} 1870’s Victorian terrace, which was left boarded up and inhabitable for 15 years before Dance renovated it and made new additions. Like many Victorian style terraces, this house had a well-planned façade with large windows. However the <b>rear</b> <b>looked</b> like an afterthought {{and a series}} of make shift rooms that may have been added at a later date. This {{resulted}} in a house that was poorly lit and very dark towards the back of the terrace. Dance approached this project aiming to leave as much of the existing structure as she could, thus leading to her building a conservatory that protruded form the outside of the building. The Conservatory consisted of floor to ceiling glass windows underneath a new pergola. The glass structure allowed for light to creep into the original parts of the house such as the kitchen and living areas. A similar aesthetic was also applied to the upper floor at a smaller scale to allow light into the bedroom.|$|R
