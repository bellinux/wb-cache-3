40|$|Gravity-depended statolith {{positioning}} in Chara rhizoids {{were investigated}} under altered gravity {{conditions on the}} Random Positioning Machine (RPM) by using this device in different operational modes (2 D clinorotation and 3 D clinorotation in real <b>random</b> <b>mode).</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate different techniques which are applied to simulate microgravity. A comparison of actin-dependent statolith displacement kinetics in Chara rhizoids during the different RPM operation modes with data from real microgravity conditions from Texus and Maxus missions allowed an assessment of the simulation quality. Displacement distance and velocity of statoliths correlated with the rotational speed of the RPM. Both, but necessarily fast 2 D clinorotation and 3 D rotation in real <b>random</b> <b>mode</b> induced in Chara rhizoids a displacement of the statoliths away from the tip with a comparable kinetic as in real microgravity. Slower rotational speeds in the 2 D clinorotation and 3 D real <b>random</b> <b>mode</b> caused less displacement of statoliths and different displacement kinetics. As a consequence, with respect to the displacement of statoliths in a unicellular system, the 2 D clinorotation is more preferable than the 3 D real <b>random</b> <b>mode.</b> In view to the displacement of statoliths in Chara rhizoids on a 3 D clinostat, the results are matching with Hoson’s (Hoson et al. 1997) observations and extend them with respect to displacement kinetics. Furthermore, the results show that every alteration of gravity amount and direction affects the movement of statoliths. Therefore it was possible to show qualitative differences between the different RPM modes based on displacement kinetics and displacement distance of statoliths. The results show, that the rotational speed of a clinostat or an RPM has to be carefully selected to achieve a qualitative microgravity simulation. Beside the rotational speed, the selection of RPM operational mode has also to be considered. Although no significant differences in statolith displacement distance were observed between fast 2 D clinorotation and 3 D real <b>random</b> <b>mode,</b> the displacement kinetics were slightly different. These differences might be influenced by stronger vibrations during the respective operation mode. The additional rotational axis in 3 D real <b>random</b> <b>mode</b> caused more intense vibration patterns. Vibration maxima appeared irregular in context to changing rotation directions. In contrast to this operation mode, the 2 D clinorotation caused weaker vibration maxima and a more regular vibration pattern through the whole measured frequency spectrum. The differentiation between 2 D mode performed with the inner frame and 2 D mode performed with the outer frame showed also different vibration patterns. The inner frame caused lesser vibrations probable through a smaller mechanical slackness and is therefore more preferable. To conclude these observations, the 2 D clinorotation with the inner frame is more preferable in view to a nearly stimulation-free environment and a qualitative good simulation. The additional rotation axis in 3 D real <b>random</b> <b>mode</b> has no further advantage toward the 2 D clinorotation with respect to the selected experimental parameters...|$|E

30|$|Since <b>random</b> <b>mode</b> {{switches}} {{have been}} used and mode switching is not triggered by network changes, these results say nothing about the actual performance gain {{that can be achieved}} when the mode switching capabilities are applied intelligently according to the network context. With <b>random</b> <b>mode</b> switches or badly assigned modes it can even occur that suboptimal routes in terms of hop count are being used (e.g., when routing via a long U-shaped proactive zone takes place, while a shorter non-proactive route could exist). Also very important to remark is that with intelligent mode switching behavior, nodes will only switch when needed and will possibly switch in group, since groups of nodes will often experience a similar network context. This is important, because when the mode switch frequency becomes too high, the packet delivery ratio drops. This is caused by the excessive amount of additional routing control packets (Figure 10 c) that is generated in case of very high mode switch frequencies increasing the convergence time of the protocol.|$|E

Clustering {{accuracy}} of partitional clustering algorithm for categorical data depends {{primarily on the}} choice of initial data points to instigate the clustering process and hence the clustering results cannot be generated and repeated consistently. In this paper we present an approach to compute initial modes for K-mode partitional clustering algorithm to cluster categorical data sets. Here we utilized the idea of evidence accumulation for combining the results of multiple clusterings. Initially, n F − dimensional data is decomposed into {{a large number of}} compact clusters; the K-modes algorithm performs this decomposition, with several clusterings obtained by N random initializations of the K-modes algorithm and the modes thus obtained for every random initialization are stored in a Mode-Pool, PN. The objective is to investigate the contribution of those data objects / patterns that are less vulnerable to the choice of <b>random</b> selection of <b>modes</b> and to choose the most diverse set of modes from the available Mode-Pool that can be utilized as initial modes for the K-mode clustering algorithm.

Traditionally, this technique requests only one polarization mode to be excited or both polarization modes to be excited with equal intensity in the PMF.
