25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} is {{a radio station}} {{designed}} to provide <b>radiocommunications</b> in the amateur radio service for an amateur radio operator. Radio amateurs build and operate several types of amateur radio stations, including fixed ground stations, mobile stations, space stations, and temporary field stations. A slang term often used for an amateur station's location is the shack, named after the small enclosures added to the upperworks of naval ships to hold early radio equipment and batteries.|$|E
25|$|Handheld radios contain all the {{necessary}} equipment for <b>radiocommunications</b> with another station. A typical radio used as a handheld station integrates a transceiver with an antenna and a battery in one handheld package. Most handheld transceivers used in amateur radio are designed for operation on the VHF or UHF amateur radio bands and most often are capable of only FM voice communications transmissions. To conserve battery power, they have limited transmitter power, often below 1W, to cover a local range of typically a few km or miles.|$|E
25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} {{established}} in a permanent structure with equipment {{that is not}} intended for portable operation {{is referred to as}} a fixed station. This is {{the most common form of}} amateur radio station, and can be found in homes, schools, and some public buildings. A typical fixed station is equipped with a transceiver and one or more antennas. For voice communications, the station will be equipped with a microphone; for communications using the Morse code, a telegraph key is common; and for communications over digital modes such as RTTY and PSK31, a station will be equipped with a specialized interface to connect the transceiver to a computer sound card. While not a requirement for <b>radiocommunications,</b> most fixed amateur radio stations are equipped with one or more computers, which serve tasks ranging from logging of contacts with other stations to various levels of station hardware control. Fixed stations might also be equipped with amplifiers, antenna rotators, SWR meters, and other station accessories.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} contesting {{can be traced}} to the Trans-Atlantic Tests of the early 1920s, when amateur radio {{operators}} first attempted to establish long distance <b>radiocommunications</b> across the Atlantic Ocean on the short wave amateur radio frequencies. [...] Even after the first two-way communications between North America and Europe were established in 1923, these tests continued to be annual events at which more and more stations were successful in establishing two-way contacts over greater and greater distances. [...] In 1927, the American Radio Relay League, which had been principal in organizing and publicizing these tests, proposed a new format for the annual event, encouraging stations to make as many two-way contacts with stations in other countries as possible. [...] The 1928 International Relay Party, as the event was renamed, was the first organized amateur radio contest. [...] The International Relay Party was an immediate success, and was sponsored annually by the ARRL from 1927 through 1935. [...] In 1936, the contest name changed to the ARRL International DX Contest, the name under which it is known today.|$|E
