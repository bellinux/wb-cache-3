40|$|Recently David Jennings and Terry Rudolph {{published}} two papers as reaction on Maccone's paper "Quantum Solution to the Arrow-of-Time Dilemma". In these papers, {{the authors}} suppose that second law of thermodynamics is not relevant for quantum systems. Unfortunately, these papers {{did not get}} <b>relevant</b> <b>reply</b> from Maccone. The reason of this is following. Both Maccone and the above-mentioned authors use thermodynamic law and thermodynamic-like terminology for non-thermodynamic systems, for example, microscopic system of three qubits. However, big size of a system (quantum or classic) is also not an enough condition for a system to be macroscopic. The macroscopic system must also be chaotic and has small chaotic interaction with its environment/observer resulting in decoherence (decorrelation). We demonstrate that for relevant thermodynamic macroscopic quantum systems no objection appears.

40|$|Using neural {{networks}} to generate replies in human-computer dialogue systems is attracting increasing attention {{over the past}} few years. However, the performance is not satisfactory: the neural network tends to generate safe, universally <b>relevant</b> <b>replies</b> which carry little meaning. In this paper, we propose a content-introducing approach to neural network-based generative dialogue systems. We first use pointwise mutual information (PMI) to predict a noun as a keyword, reflecting the main gist of the reply. We then propose seq 2 BF, a "sequence to backward and forward sequences" model, which generates a reply containing the given keyword. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional sequence-to-sequence models in terms of human evaluation and the entropy measure, and that the predicted keyword can appear at an appropriate position in the reply.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of an {{evaluation}} function to increase the local relevance of replies in online anchored discussion. Being implemented in a university course on French linguistics, a regular system for anchored discussion is compared with two versions that are enhanced with an integrated evaluation function. The function asks students to evaluate the relevance of each others’ replies. To compare between experimental and control conditions, the collaboration protocols are analysed with a newly developed coding scheme for the local relevance of replies. Statistical processing of the data is done with a multilevel approach and results indicate that an evaluation function can effectively increase the local relevance of students’ replies, but only if it is actually used to a certain extent. Using the evaluation function is hypothesized to increase students’ awareness of the importance of writing <b>relevant</b> <b>replies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Three very {{prominent}} arguments for atheism are (1) the argument from sub-optimality, (2) {{the problem of}} no best world, and (3) the evidential argument from gratuitous evil. To date, it has not sufficiently been appreciated that several important criticisms of these arguments have all relied on a shared strategy. Although the details vary, {{the core of this}} strategy is to concede that God either cannot or need not achieve the best outcome in the relevant choice situation, but to insist that God must and can achieve an outcome that is good enough. In short, this strategy invokes divine satisficing in response to these arguments for atheism. (The widespread use of this strategy may have gone unnoticed because the appeal to divine satisficing is usually implicit.) In sections 1 - 3, the three arguments for atheism will be set out, and it will be shown that the <b>relevant</b> <b>replies</b> all employ this shared strategy. Section 4 will show that those who invoke divine satisficing have failed to establish that this is a coherent notion. Accordingly, these replies to three important arguments for atheism are, at present, incomplete. 1. THE ARGUMENT FROM SUB-OPTIMALITY Suppose that there is a unique best of all possible worlds. Against this ontological backdrop, the following argument for atheism has been proposed...|$|R
50|$|When {{replying}} to long discussions, {{particularly in}} newsgroup discussions, quoted text {{from the original}} message is often trimmed so as to leave only the parts that are <b>relevant</b> to the <b>reply</b> — or only a reminder thereof.

40|$|E-mails are {{a rapidly}} growing medium to {{establish}} communications between customers and companies. They are processed in a large centralised system termed Mail Center.

40|$|Purpose – Previous {{research}} shows that symmetrical dialogue between companies and their investors through e-mail does not match {{the quality of the}} asymmetrically provided information on investor relations websites. This paper seeks to further examine the quality of symmetrical dialogue and especially whether sender identity affects the corporate e-mail handling performance. Design/methodology/approach – A “mystery sender” approach is used to test whether companies answer similar e-mails from two different stakeholder groups: investors and journalists. The corporate replies were evaluated for responsiveness, timeliness and relevance. Findings – Overall responsiveness from the companies in the sample is low, and e-mails from journalists turn out to get significantly fewer and less <b>relevant</b> <b>replies</b> than e-mails from investors. Thus, the idea of sender identity affecting the way companies respond to e-mail inquiries is empirically supported. Practical implications – Stakeholders of listed companies should not rely too much on symmetrical dialogue by e-mail given the high probability of non-response, especially for journalists. Companies offering the possibility of symmetrical communication need to critically evaluate their information system to achieve better results in handling e-mail from stakeholders {{and to make sure that}} certain stakeholder groups are not discriminated. Originality/value – This is one of the first papers that present evidence on how corporate investor relation departments respond to e-mails from different types of stakeholder groups. The paper contributes to a better understanding of the variables that drive the quality of symmetrical dialogue between companies and stakeholders groups. Electronic mail, Investors...|$|R
40|$|Kieser and Leiner (2009) {{maintain}} that the rigour-relevance gap in management research is fundamentally unbridgeable because researchers and the researched inhabit separate social systems. They {{argue that it is}} impossible to assess the relevance of research outputs within the system of science and that neither action research nor related approaches to collaborative research can succeed in producing research that is rigorous as well as <b>relevant.</b> In <b>reply,</b> we show how their analysis is inconsistent with available evidence. Drawing on a diversity of management research domains, we provide counter-illustrations of work where researchers, in a number of cases in collaboration with practitioners, have generated knowledge that is both socially useful and academically rigorous.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to facilitate}} students’ online learning conversations in higher education, using asynchronous online forum discussion. Despite offering a great learning potential, online discussions also present several obstacles for conducting effective learning conversations. Therefore, this dissertation {{focuses on the}} question how to facilitate students’ online learning conversations, by manipulating the affordances of online discussion tools. This facilitation is aimed in particular at the degree in which students’ conversations are meaning-oriented and interactionally coherent. In the first study, a system for “anchored discussion” is compared with a system for traditional forum discussion (Blackboard), and their collaborative and communicative affordances for the collaborative processing of academic texts are investigated. Compared to face-to-face conversations, online conversations offer a reduced conversational “context” which may hinder collaborative learning processes. Anchored discussion strengthens this context by providing a document under discussion and enabling users to anchor their messages in specific passages of the document. Results show that students’ conversation in the system for anchored discussion is more directed at a constructive processing {{of the meaning of}} texts than in the traditional forum, which is more oriented towards a more debate-like sharing of personal opinions and experiences. In addition, while messages in the traditional forum resemble usual discussion or email conversation and contain social and regulative comments, discussion in the system for anchored discussion is seen to be more efficient and “to-the-point”. We conclude that for collaborative text comprehension by undergraduate students, anchored discussion might be more suitable than traditional forum discussion. The second study investigates the use of an evaluation function to increase the local relevance of replies in online anchored discussion. In a university course on French linguistics, a regular system for anchored discussion is compared with two versions that are enhanced with an integrated evaluation function. The function asks students to evaluate the relevance of each others’ replies. To compare between experimental and control conditions, the collaboration protocols are analyzed with a newly developed coding scheme for the local relevance of replies. Results indicate that an evaluation function can effectively increase the local relevance of students’ replies, but only if it is actually used to a certain extent. Using the evaluation function is hypothesized to increase students’ awareness of the importance of writing <b>relevant</b> <b>replies.</b> The third study investigates the nature, reception, and use of online peer feedback in different contexts and tools in higher education. Results show that feedback with concrete suggestions for revisions are most being applied, which may be because they give the receivers the best and most direct lead for a potential change. This study also shows the potential value of using anchored discussion for facilitating online peer feedback, as it seems to elicit less evaluative remarks and more suggestions for revisions, than the Blackboard environment. In sum, anchored discussion has shown to be a versatile tool with many possible uses that concern the discussion of online materials or the interactive exchange of peer feedback and we encourage further research and development on the subject...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 359 general {{practitioner}} organisers of {{continuing medical education}} in England and Wales were sent a questionnaire on their role and responsibilities in 1985; 206 with <b>relevant</b> duties <b>replied.</b> The results of the survey showed that they were playing an effective part in planning, organising, and evaluating educational activities at district level, that many were highly qualified and experienced general practitioners, and that many had previously been concerned in vocational training. Less than half had undergone formal training for their continuing education role. Only 105 (51 %) were appointed district general practitioner tutors. They were more active in postgraduate centres than in practice based education. Almost a quarter (49) spent three to five hours a week on their educational duties, but 111 (54 %) spent fewer hours. Although well provided with educational resources, few had any control over district educational funds, and over half lacked office space. As to remuneration, 161 (78 %) received 500 pounds or less a year and almost two thirds received no reimbursement for expenses. Most had no job description. Attention is drawn to the case for appointing general practitioner organisers of continuing medical education ("district general practice tutors") in all districts of England and Wales, to their role in improving the participation of general practitioners in continuing medical education, and to {{the urgent need for}} a national agreement on their job description, preparation, support, and remuneration...|$|R
40|$|Currently, the {{subsidies}} {{are one of}} the main sources of restrictions in international trade, and a disturbance factor of liberalization process in that field, which is particularly emphasized in the times of economic crises. Due to its economic impact, such behavior causes unavoidably the implementation of countervailing measures. However, as its extensive use has the potential to turn them into the instrument of protectionism, it is necessary to deploy the appropriate legal rules in order to determine precisely the conditions and regime for the use of such subsidies, as well as the implementation of countervailing measures in the case of violation of that regime. The processes of liberalization of our foreign trade system and constant foreign trade deficit make the need for protection of our own economy and creating of appropriate set of defense instruments against non-permitted/illegal subsidies in our law more and more <b>relevant.</b> The <b>reply</b> to that need in new economic circumstances was the enactment of a new Law on Foreign Trade Operations in 2009 and, in particular the enactment of the accompanying bylaws. Its rules in the field of subsidies have been largely harmonized with the requirements of the World Trade Organizations, and consequently with the European Union standards, in both the conceptual aspect and aspect of individual solutions. However, there is still a chronic issue of the lack of institutional and appropriate human resources assumptions for its full and optimum implementation...|$|R
30|$|The current {{version of}} this {{prototype}} identifies location using two Near Field Communication (NFC) RFID tags, one at the space entrance {{and the other one}} at the space exit. The entrance tag holds “ENTER:location_id” while the exit tag holds “EXIT:location_id”, where location_id represents a numeric value of the location ID. We store the location information on tags in plain text. The user taps the mobile application to scan the location ID. The NFC scanner reads the NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) message from the RFID tag and reports it to the Context Manager, which extracts the locations ID and the user status to query the database for <b>relevant</b> applications and <b>replies</b> with the recommended actions. If an application is found relevant, the Downloader downloads and installs it onto the user’s smartphone along with the proper access privileges or function constraints. We remark that the use of RFID to identify space is only an instance and other techniques, including use of beacons are also possible.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{in order}} to operationalize the type and level of social embeddedness, we caputre social media users’ {{engagement}} in online discussion, including number of tweets, number of reply tweets, and number of tweets with URL links. Greater volumes {{of any of these}} tweeting behaviors (tweets, replies, and URLs) suggest that the public may be more aware of focal issues and events, and in turn be more motivated in seeking, spreading, and exchanging information, ideas, and emotions in cyberspaces. Such social contexts may raise individuals’ perception of the efficacy of protests, which could lead to actual protest actions. More replies and URL links suggest being more embedded in <b>relevant</b> social networks. <b>Replies</b> suggest direct interactions with other embedded users. URL links, on the other hand, suggest information networks built based on relevant information/content created by others, including internal links with other tweets, and external links such as news, blogs, etc. The complete list of features and detailed interpretation are provided in Fig.  6 (a), Fig.  6 (b), and Sect.  5.2.|$|R
