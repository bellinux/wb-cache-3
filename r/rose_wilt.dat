40|$|Presented {{review of}} rose diseases, {{associated}} with the plant degeneration symptoms, includes rose streak, rose colour break, rose rosette or rose witches' broom, rose dieback, <b>rose</b> <b>wilt,</b> rose stunt, rose leaf curl, rose spring dwarf, rose little leaf, rose "frisure", rose bud proliferation and rose flower proliferation. Most of these disorders are characterized by stunting or dwarfing of plants accompanied by a partial wilt and dieback of shoots. Proliferation and epinasty often occurred. Apart from detected viruses (TSV. SLRSV) parts of degeneration syndrome have been transmitted by grafting other have failed to achieve any transmission of the causal agent. It seems likely that rose degeneration disorders in spite of symptom similarities are due to a complex of interacting factors including probably viruses...|$|E
5000|$|... "East Harlem" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. The song was chosen upon release as Pitchfork Media's [...] "Best New Track". Marc Hogan stated that, [...] "East Harlem looks poised {{to undergo a}} similar sort of ripening as it {{becomes more and more}} familiar. The lyrics are sparse and rooted in classic, instantly communicative tropes: [...] "Another <b>rose</b> <b>wilts</b> in East Harlem," [...] Condon croons, as he wastes no words in vividly describing an intra-Manhattan relationship that feels like it's separated by [...] "a thousand miles" [...] (have you tried getting from downtown to East Harlem lately?)." [...] Hogan continues by saying, [...] "the stately backing is what we've come to expect from Beirut, with swaying accordion, rich brass, lively piano, and trebly strums, all in all more like a 2010 Williamsburg performance. By the time Condon switches things up, repeating, [...] "Oh, the sound will bring me home again," [...] over wordless backing vocals, he might as well be describing the warm, cozy but still distinctive feeling [...] "East Harlem" [...] has achieved." ...|$|R

A suitable and modified medium was obtained in which test fungus exhibited enhanced antifungal activity and produced larger inhibition zone against the verticillium fungus. The study {{carried out to}} modify the medium components at level of nitrogen, carbon source and their concentration on agar plates. Addition of amino acids, metals and plant growth hormones did not show positive effect but glycerol enhanced the antifungal activity very much...|$|R
5000|$|... "My Belgian Rose" [...] {{depicts the}} American effort in Europe, {{particularly}} {{focused on the}} viewpoint of the soldiers. The soldiers describe {{an appreciation for the}} beauty that has been destroyed in the war and they express the hope of restoring that beauty once again. [...] Commentary by author Timothy Scheurer remarks that like other songs of the time, [...] "My Belgian Rose" [...] envisions the post-war environment; it uses the rose to represent regeneration in Europe brought about by the promise and efforts of U.S. forces. Early in the piece, the <b>rose</b> is <b>wilting</b> and being crushed by [...] "the tyrant", but later, the lyrics state that the rose will endure and [...] "bloom on a happier day." [...] Scheurer also notes that the concept of restoring [...] "American beauty" [...] abroad is a theme in the 1940 piece, [...] "Johnny Doughboy Found a Rose in Ireland" [...] describing American soldiers stationed in Northern Ireland just prior to World War II.|$|R

50|$|The {{next day}} while job hunting, Emily sees two cops with a flyer asking for {{information}} about the murder of Sam. She confronts Dr. Madden, and he comes clean: Though Sam was already dead from the fall, Dr. Madden claims he would have killed Sam regardless for what he had done to Emily. Dr. Madden reveals his copy of the Necronomicon and how he learned of its information on sustaining life. In the greenhouse, Dr. Madden proves this by injecting a <b>wilted</b> <b>rose</b> with a compound to revive it, claiming that {{as long as it is}} kept out of the sun, it will never die. The two have sex, with a distraught Lena spying on them.|$|R
40|$|Rose (Rosa sinensis L.) is one {{commodity}} florikulture {{important as}} a component in agribusiness systems and as an ornamental plant. Roses as an ornamental plant has two types, namely roses for the garden and roses for cut flowers. Cut flowers are marketed must have a good quality. One aspect of the desired quality is {{the life of a}} cut flower freshness long. Age freshness of cut flowers can be done by granting long soaking solution which is natural as a preservative. This study aims to get the right composition of the soaking solution between betel leaf extract, citric acid and sugar to prolong the freshness of roses. Results showed that betel leaf extract very significant effect on the diameter of the roses in full bloom at 2, 6, 8, and 10 DAT (Days After Treatment), 8 and 10 flower sepals DAT, the index rose florescence 8 and 10 DAT, the index kelayuan rose 6. 8 and 10 DAT and organoleptic (color), real influence on organoleptic (texture) and had no significant effect on the diameter of flowers in full bloom 4 DAT, petal number 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 DAT, sepals index flower 2, 4 and 6 DAT, and florescence index rose 2, 4 and 6 DAT. The best treatment is found in the treatment of betel leaf extract 200 g / L of water. Soaking time no real effect on the diameter of roses in full bloom, the number of petals, sepals index, the index <b>rose</b> florescence, indexes <b>wilted</b> <b>roses</b> and organoleptic (color and texture). Soaking time is best found in the soaking time of 9 days. There is a significant interaction between treatment betel leaf extract and soaking time on indexes sepals on 10 DAT and florescence index rose at 4 DAT...|$|R
50|$|Occupying the mid-northern {{section of}} the Botanical Gardens is the Lord & Taylor Rose Garden, also called the Parterre. The first path leads to a {{rectangular}} area with separate sections for housing the various roses both antique and modern. The rosarian, Abedalhadi Mousa, is responsible for many daily activities of maintenance including deadheading, or clipping off the blackened and dried ends of the rose bushes with his pruning shears and throwing them into a large plastic bin. He clips off the <b>wilting</b> <b>roses</b> also, removing the whites, pinks, and reds that sprinkle the green landscape. The premises are scattered with such volunteers and workers, characterized by their the straw gardening hats that signify their expertise with the plants around them. These employees both {{take care of the}} foliage as well as assist onlookers, directing them to such sources of information as the Dial and Discover service.|$|R
50|$|The story {{concerns}} {{a small black}} boy from the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, who meets a blonde tourist girl who gives him a rose. In return, she asks for a squirrel monkey. Smitten, he fulfills his promise by setting a trap made out of rice and a coconut, but when he returns to where he had seen her, the boat she had come in was gone. When he returns, to his home, he finds that the rose {{she had given him}} had wilted. He asks his mother, Drusila, why it had lived such a short time while other things last much, much longer. She doesn't know, so he ran around his village, asking the neighbors the same question. None of them know, so he asks his friend, Doña Madorra the turtle, his question. She doesn't know, so she brings him and the squirrel monkey around the jungle, asking some old and wise animals including Don Torcuato the alligator and Talamanca the bocaracá, a snake. After the interrogations of the alligator and the snake, Cocorí finally gets an answer from El Negro Cantor. He returns home to find that Drusila had planted the stem of the <b>wilted</b> <b>rose</b> and so grown a rose bush.|$|R
40|$|Phaseic acid (PA) and dihydrophaseic acid (DPA) are {{the major}} {{metabolites}} observed when (S) - 2 - 14 C-abscisic acid (ABA) is fed to 14 -day excised primary bean leaves (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Red Kidney). The distribution of 14 C in leaves which were wilted after feeding ABA {{appears to be the}} same as that observed in unwilted leaves. A reduction in the relative specific radioactivities of the two metabolites after wilting, compared with the specific radioactivities measured in unwilted plants, indicated that these metabolites continue to be formed endogenously after wilting. Estimates of the endogenous ABA levels showed that they rose from 0. 04 μg to approximately 0. 5 μg/g fresh weight within 4 hours after the beginning of a 10 % wilt and remained at that level during a subsequent 20 hours of wilt. In unwilted leaves, the levels of PA and DPA were 5 times and 20 times higher than that of ABA, respectively. Both PA and DPA levels <b>rose</b> throughout the <b>wilt</b> period. PA <b>rose</b> from 0. 20 μg to 1. 0 μg and DPA from 0. 8 μg to over 3 μg/g fresh weight. From these data, we calculated the rate of ABA synthesis to be at least 0. 15 μg/hr. g fresh weight during this period. We have interpreted these results to mean that in wilted leaves an elevated level of ABA is maintained because the rate of synthesis and metabolism are both elevated and approximately equal...|$|R
