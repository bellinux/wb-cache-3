2500|$|The Integrative Action of the Nervous System:Published in 1906, [...] {{this was}} a {{compendium}} of ten of Sherrington's Silliman lectures, delivered at Yale University in 1904. In the publication, he discussed neuron theory, the [...] "synapse" [...] (a term he had coined in 1897) and communication between neurons, and a mechanism for the <b>reflex-arc</b> function. The work effectively resolved the debate between neuron and reticular theory in mammals, thereby shaping {{our understanding of the}} central nervous system. He expressed his theory that the nervous system acts as the coordinator of various parts of the body and that the reflexes are the simplest expressions of the interactive action of the nervous system, enabling the entire body to function toward one definite end at a time. He also pointed out that reflexes have to be goal-directive and purposive. Furthermore, he established the nature of postural reflexes and their dependence on the anti-gravity stretch reflex and traced the afferent stimulus to the proprioceptive end organs, which he had previously shown to be sensory in nature ("proprioceptive" [...] was another term he had coined). The work was dedicated to Ferrier.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the problem of how motion control can be {{achieved}} in very simple systems under a minimal amount of preconditions. The system's design therefore is as minimal as possible, reflecting the basal <b>reflex-arc</b> as observed in biological systems. The model for the movement of the agent is a multiplicatively modified random walk and thus does not represent a diffusion process of Langevin type. The mobile agent shows a reliable and fast homing behavior towards a defined area and finally stays in some defined neighborhood of this area. Moreover, obstacle avoidance is shown to be an immediate result of the system's properties.

25|$|Sherrington's {{first job}} of full-professorship came with his {{appointment}} as Holt Professor of Physiology at Liverpool in 1895, succeeding Francis Gotch. With his {{appointment to the}} Holt Chair, Sherrington ended his active work in pathology. Working on cats, dogs, monkeys, and apes that had been bereaved of their cerebral hemispheres, he found that reflexes must be considered integrated activities of the total organism, not just the result of activities of the so-called <b>reflex-arcs,</b> a concept then generally accepted. There he continued his work on reflexes and reciprocal innervation. His papers on the subject were synthesized into the Croonian lecture of 1897.|$|R
40|$|The first {{flexible}} parylene-based multielectrode arrays (MEAs) {{designed for}} functional electrical stimulation (FES) in retinal prostheses, and {{the extension of}} this technology toward enabling <b>reflex-arc</b> neuromodulation in cases of spinal cord damage or transection, are presented. A single metal layer 16 × 16 retinal electrode array of 125 μm-diameter thin-film Ti/Pt electrodes and lines of 12 μm-pitch has been fabricated as a demonstration of this technology. To allow for even higher density arrays, a novel dual-layer process has also been implemented that enables leads to pass under overlying electrodes without making electrical contact to them. A biomimetic parylene-based electrode array consisting of 1024 electrodes of highly variable spacing, 60 {{of which have been}} connected in this manner, has been fabricated according to this paradigm. A parylene-parylene annealing process has also been developed to increase device longevity under accelerated-lifetime saline soak conditions. Surgical tests of novel anatomically-conformal geometries that enable such parylene-based electrode systems to interact with their neuronal targets of interest while causing minimal mechanical damage to tissues or to the implants are also presented. The use of these flexible electrode arrays in spinal cord stimulation experiments in animal models has proven their efficacy in stimulating neurons...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of the molecular hydrogen ions H 2 + and H 3 + is expected {{to play an important}} role in a wide variety of plasmas, such as planetary ionospheres [1], neutral beam sources [2], and the edge and divertor regions of magnetic fusion devices [3]. Many of the collision rate coefficients relevant for H 2 + and H 3 + creation and destruction have been calculated (e. g. Ref [4]); however, there has been little experimental validation for many of these calculations. Here, equilibrium molecular ion concentrations are measured under typical hydrogen gas discharge conditions (Ne » 1011 - 1012 cm- 3, NH 2 » 1013 - 1015 cm- 3, Te » 2 10 eV). Over this parameter range, the molecular ion concentration is found to vary between 0. 1 and 1. The observed concentrations can be modeled reasonably well (typically within about 25 %) using currently available rate coefficients, provided that the molecular hydrogen vibrational temperature Tvib is included. Neglecting Tvib typically results in the equilibrium molecular ion concentration being underestimated by a factor of 2 5. A schematic of the University of California, San Diego PISCES-A <b>reflex-arc</b> discharge is shown in Fig. 1. The experimental apparatus has been described previously [5]. The dominantly H+ plasma created in the source region passes through a floating copper baffle tube before entering the target chamber. This baffling allows the target pressure region pressure to be varied over the range Ptarget » 0. 5 3...|$|E
