5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines {{a few inches}} from the corners, the entire table is divided into {{rectangular}} balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain distance lengthwise and widthwise across the length of the table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, <b>rectangles</b> are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{earliest}} buildings were simple gabled <b>rectangles,</b> a style that continued to be built into the seventeenth century. Examples include Dunnottar Castle in the 1580s, Greenock (1591) and Durness (1619), These new buildings often had windows on the south wall and none on the north, which became a unique feature of Reformation kirks. There were continuities with pre-Reformation materials, with some churches using rubble, as at Kemback in Fife (1582). Others employed stone and a few added wooden steeples, as at Burntisland (1592). The church of Greyfriars, Edinburgh, built between 1602 and 1620, used a rectangular layout with a largely Gothic form, but that at Dirleton (1612), had a more sophisticated classical style.|$|E
5|$|Pathways was Bungie's fourth title (and third {{commercial}} title) {{after their}} previous game, Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete, sold around 2,500 copies. In {{the summer of}} 1992, Jones was living in dorms at the University of Chicago when he saw Wolfenstein 3D, a shooter game with three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Inspired, Jones created a rough 3D-graphics engine for the Mac that simulated walls with trapezoids and <b>rectangles.</b> Originally, Bungie intended Pathways to be a straightforward 3D version of Minotaur, but they quickly found that the top-down perspective of their previous game did not mesh with the 3D presentation. An additional consideration was that the developers {{wanted to create a}} game that did not rely on then-rare networks and modems, an issue in marketing Minotaur. The rest of 1992 was spent tweaking the graphics engine.|$|E

5|$|The Winslow Ames House is a {{prefabricated}} modular International Style {{house in}} New London, Connecticut, United States. It {{was designed by}} Robert W.

The modular house, comprising three <b>rectangles</b> and a flat roof, was constructed on a concrete slab with a welded steel framework.

The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor, and grain. Texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—use fractions, compute the volumes of boxes and pyramids, and calculate the surface areas of <b>rectangles,</b> triangles, and circles. They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry, and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations.|$|E
5|$|When all mission {{objectives}} are completed, the player {{is given the}} option to make a hyperspace jump to end the level.

When the hyperspace jump is initiated, all fighters return to the mothership while larger ships line up next to it, and blue <b>rectangles</b> pass over the ships and teleport them to the next level. The player retains their fleet between levels, {{and the difficulty of}} each mission is adjusted to a small extent based on how many ships are in the player's fleet {{at the beginning of each}} level. In multiplayer games, the objective is typically to destroy the enemy motherships, though other battle-oriented victory conditions are available. The mothership is capable of movement, and as there are no levels, the research done at the research vessel follows a technology tree with each upgrade or ship design taking a set amount of time, rather than also being dependent on a plot point. Multiple maps are available, as are options to turn off the need to research technologies or fuel consumption for smaller ships.|$|E

The garden was grown above a man-made level platform where {{there used to be}} a hill, and was exactly one acre (about 4000sqm) in area. A gravel path runs from the back of the house to the southern edge, and was twelve feet (3.7m) wide during Mason's time period, the same width as the central passage in the house and the portico. Today, the path is narrower, crowded by boxwoods that are now about 250 years old. The path ends in an overlook extending out from the steep edge of the garden. From here, the Potomac river can be seen. The Gunston Hall museum website says that the view was more impressive during Mason's time, when the trees were cleared. The garden was most likely broken into four <b>rectangles,</b> with additional gravel paths running through and around it.

Assume that we wish to cover an a-by-b <b>rectangle</b> with square tiles exactly, where a is the larger of the two numbers. We first attempt to tile the <b>rectangle</b> using b-by-b square tiles; however, this leaves an r0-by-b residual <b>rectangle</b> untiled, where r0 < b.

The sequence ends when there is no residual <b>rectangle,</b> i.e., when the square tiles cover the previous residual <b>rectangle</b> exactly. The length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the GCD of the dimensions of the original <b>rectangle.</b> For example, the smallest square tile in the adjacent figure is 21-by-21 (shown in red), and 21 is the GCD of 1071 and 462, the dimensions of the original <b>rectangle</b> (shown in green).|$|R
