40|$|The {{task was}} to {{synthesise}} an adjustable hydraulic system structure, the mathematical model of which takes into account its inherent nonlinearity. Its solution suggests using a successive computer simulations starting with a structure of the linearized stable hydraulic system, which is then complicated by including the essentially non-linear elements. The hydraulic system thus obtained {{may be unable to}} meet the Lyapunov stability criterion and be unstable. This can be eliminated through correcting elements. Control of correction results is provided according to the form of transition processes due to stepwise variation of the control signal. Computer simulation of a throttle-controlled electrohydraulic servo drive with the <b>rotary</b> <b>output</b> element illustrates the proposed method application.

40|$|Current {{techniques}} for manual and automated determination of decametre-range are reviewed from information gained by extensive literature search and from visits {{made to a}} wide cross section of European establishments concerned with large-scale dimensional measurements. The reviews, which contain nearly 200 references, provide background information needed by systems designers. A 12 m steel measuring base is described which was length stabilised to within 3 parts in 10 for periods in excess of 500 hours. Temperature of the internal water flow is monitored by a contact thermometer which controls the heat input. The {{theory and practice of}} tensioned-wire dimensional transducers are given which enables this new-class of dimensional measuring instrument to be designed. Two distinct groups of instrument described are those for transducing continuous length changes into electrical signals with better than 5 parts in 10 ^ 6 error and those for detecting changes of 1 part in 10 ^ 10 or smaller, of a nominally fixed length. Continuous subdivision transducers with 12 m and 1 m range are reported which incorporate mechanical mechanisms for obtaining adjustable absolute length, reduction of in-scale accuracy, errors, linear <b>rotary</b> <b>output,</b> rapid following response and simple temperature compensation. A method and practical apparatus are described which uses this type of transducer for automatic control of the position of a workhea moved on a cartesian-frame manipulator. Actual two-dimensional position is measured on a trilateral basis, a technique which eliminates the need for a massive framework when machining or inspecting large workpieces. In-situ numerically-controlled machining is possible with this system. A second frameless technique is described for automatically recording roundness variations of large rings or spigots. Repeatability of 5 parts in 10 ^ 6 or better has been proven to be possible with inexpensive equipment. This method illustrates the use of deformation wire-transducers for dynamic dimensional measurement. A similar type of instrument was used for creep determination of invariwires and carbon-fibres supported on the 12 m base. Results are given which have shown that 1 part in 10 ^ 8 length stability is attainable over considerable periods. It is shown that measurement of earth strains is possible with an invar wire tensioned by a simple beam-balance. Details are given of an experiment performed in a tunnel in which solid-earth tidal strains are recorded within hours of installation. Several other possible applications are discussed for which tensioned-wire transducers seem suited. The use of position-sensitive photocells in dimensional metrology is outlined with particular reference to wire transducers where linear and rotary movements may need monitoring.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the kinematics formulation {{of an internal}} combustion engine crank mechanism. The kinematics formulation of the crank mechanism is done using vector loop method and cosine rule are applied to describe {{the position of the}} piston. Following the velocity of piston and connecting rod is performed by differentiating the position in terms of the crank angle and connecting rod angle respectively. The acceleration equation with brief form is derived from the velocity in the same principle. Based on the kinematics, the equations of motion of crank mechanism components are formulated for each moving link and platform then, all motion parameters of each component about its crank angle are readily derived. Furthermore the 2 D model is provided by using 2 D Auto CAD software in order to visualize the system and mathematical algorithm solved by using software MATLAB. The forces acting on the crank mechanism and the torque applied are also formulated based on the angles of the crank and connecting rod. Introduction. The Internal combustion engine is those that burn their fuel which is mixture of air and petrol from carburetor inside the cylinder or compress air only on the cylinder and injects diesel from injector nozzle. These IC engines convert the chemical energy stored in their fuel into heat energy during the power stroke of piston. The energy produced from burning of fuel is used for motion of piston; the working of a four stroke engine is based on simple slider crank mechanism. The kinematics of IC engine is not altering from simple slider crank mechanism. The kinematics formulation of the crank mechanism such as piston motion and connecting rod motion utilizes different software and methodologies for which it is suitable for manipulation The crank mechanism comprised of components like crank shaft, connecting rod and piston which changes the sudden displacement to a smooth <b>rotary</b> <b>output</b> which is the input to many devices such as pumps generators and compressors. A detailed procedure of getting stresses in the fillet area of a crank mechanism particularly crank shaft was introduced by Henry et al. [1], in which FEM and BEM (Boundary Element Method) were used. Obtained stresses were ratified by experimental results on turbocharged compression ignition engine with Ricardo type combustion chamber configuration. The crank mechanism durability assessment tool used in this study was developed by RENAULT Guagliano et al. [2] conducted a study on a marine diesel engine crankshaft and connecting rod. Payer et al. [3] developed a two-step technique to perform nonlinear transient analysis of crank mechanism combining a beam-mass model and a solid element model and Prakash et al. [4] performed stress and fatigue analysis on three example parts belonging to three different classes of engines, light automotive crankshaft was studied by Borges et al. [5]. The geometry of the crank mechanism was geometrically restricted due to limitations in the computer resources available to the authors. Shenoy and Fatemi [6] conducted dynamic analysis of loads in the connecting rod and piston components, which is in contact with the crankshaft. Dynamic analysis of the connecting rod is similar to dynamics of the crankshaft, since these components form a slide-crank mechanism and the connecting rod motion applies dynamic load on the crank-pin bearing [...] Shenoy and Fatemi [7] optimized the crank mechanism considering dynamic service load on the component. It was shown that dynamic analysis is the proper basis for fatigue performance calculation and optimization of dynamically loaded components. A literature survey by Zoroufi and Fatemi [8] focused on durability performance evaluation and comparisons of forged steel and cast iron crankshafts. The piston-connecting rod-crankshaft assembly in the reciprocating piston-engines is used to transform the gas forces generated during combustion within the working cylinder into a piston stroke, which the crankshafts converts into useful torque available at the flywheel. The cyclic operation leads to unequal gas forces, and the acceleration and deceleration of the reciprocating powe...|$|E

40|$|The {{mission of}} the International Space Station {{is to provide a}} working {{laboratory}} in orbit for research in engineering, life sciences, and microgravity. Among the microgravity disciplines that are preparing to utilize this international resource are materials processing, combustion, fluid dynamics, biotechnology, and fundamental physics. The Station promises to enable significant advances in each of these areas by making available a research facility in which gravitational and other accelerations, and their corresponding buoyancy and diffusion effects on various physical processes, are orders of magnitude lower than they are on Earth. In order to fulfill this promise, it is not enough for the Space Station to simply replicate a typical terrestrial scientific laboratory in orbit. Although an orbiting laboratory is free of most of the effects of gravitational acceleration by virtue of its free fall condition, it also produces structural vibration or jitter that can interfere with the processes under study. To ensure the quality of the acceleration environment and enable a successful mission, the Space Station Program has limited potential disturbances in two ways: first, by isolating the most sensitive payloads from the vehicle structure, and second, by quieting major disturbances at their sources. The first area, payload isolation, is implemented inside the pressurized modules at the rack level. Sub-rack level isolators have also been developed. This paper addresses the second area, disturbance source limits, for one of the major sources of mechanical noise on the Space Station: the Solar Alpha Rotary Joints. Due to the potential for large disturbances to the microgravity environment, an initial analytical prediction of <b>rotary</b> joint vibration <b>output</b> was made. Key components were identified and tested to validate the analytical predictions. Based on the component test results, the final vibration output of the joints was verified by a test on each fully assembled flight unit. This paper describes the Space Station microgravity requirements, the rotary joint hardware, and the disturbance producing aspects of joint operation. The test setup, instrumentation, test conditions, and results for the component level and system level measurements are described. An overall forcing function that describes the maximum torque imparted to the Station is created based on the test results, and these disturbances are shown to meet the applicable Space Station microgravity requirements...|$|R
40|$|Small scale {{unmanned}} aircraft, such as quadrotors, {{that are}} quickly emerging as versatile tools {{for a wide}} range of applications including search and rescue, hazardous environment exploration, or just shooting great video, are known as micro air vehicles (MAVs). However, for millimeter scale vehicles with weights under 10 grams, conventional flight technologies become greatly inefficient and instead inspiration is drawn from biology. Flapping wing MAVs (FWMAVs) have been created based on insects and hummingbirds in an effort to emulate their extreme agility and ability to hover in place. FWMAVs possess unique capabilities in terms of maneuverability, small size, and ability to operate in dynamic environments that make them particularly well suited for environmental monitoring and swarm applications such as artificial crop pollination. Despite their advantages, significant challenges in fabrication, power, and control must be overcome in order to make FWMAVs a reliable platform. Current designs suffer from high mechanical complexity and often rely on off-board power, sensing, and control, which compromises their autonomy and limits practical applications. The goal of my research is to develop a simple FWMAV design that provides high efficiency and controllability. An efficient, simple, and controllable vehicle design is developed utilizing the principles of resonance, emulation of biological flight control, and under-actuation. A highly efficient, resonant actuator is achieved by attaching a spring in parallel to the output shaft of a commercial geared DC micro-motor. This actuator directly drives the wings of the vehicle, allowing them to be controlled precisely and independently. This direct control strategy emulates biology and differs from other FWMAV designs that utilize complicated transmissions to generate flapping from <b>rotary</b> motor <b>output.</b> Direct control of the wings allows for emulation of biological wing kinematics, resulting in control based on wing motion alone. Furthermore, under-actuation is employed to mimic the rotational motion of insect wings. A rotational joint is added between the motor and wing membrane such that the wing rotates passively in response to aerodynamic forces that are generated as the wing is driven. This design is realized in several stages, initial prototyping, simulation and development of the actuator and wings, then finally a control system is developed. First the system was modeled and improved experimentally in order to achieve lift off. Improvements to the actuator were realized through component variation and custom fabrication increasing torque and power density by 161. 1 % and 666. 8 % respectively compared to the gearmotor alone and increased the resonant operating frequency of the vehicle from 4 Hz to 23 Hz. Advances in wing fabrication allowed for flexible wings that increased translational lift production by 35. 3 %, aerodynamic efficiency by 41. 3 %, and the effective lift coefficient by 63. 7 % with dynamic twisting. A robust control architecture was then developed iteratively based on a date driven system model in order to increase flight time from 1 second (10 wing strokes) to over 10 seconds (230 wing strokes). The resulting design improves lift to weight by 166 %, allowing for a payload capacity of approximately 8. 7 g and offers the potential for fully autonomous operation with all necessary components included on-board. A thermal model for micro-motors was developed and tuned to accurately predict an upper limit of system operation of 41 seconds as well as to optimize a heatsink that increases operating time by 102. 4 %...|$|R
