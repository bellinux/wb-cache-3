5|$|Friedman was an {{advisor to}} Republican U.S. President <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>and</b> Conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. His {{political}} philosophy extolled {{the virtues of}} a free market economic system with minimal intervention.

5|$|In 1984, {{former vice}} {{president}} and presidential candidate Walter Mondale, seen as an underdog, selected Ferraro to be his running mate in the upcoming election.

The positive polling the Mondale-Ferraro ticket received when she joined soon faded, as damaging questions arose about her and her businessman husband's finances and wealth and her Congressional disclosure statements. In the general election, Mondale and Ferraro were defeated in a landslide by incumbent President <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>and</b> Vice President George H. W. Bush.|$|E

5|$|President Theodore Roosevelt {{established}} {{the first national}} monument, Devils Tower in Wyoming, on September 24, 1906. He established 18 national monuments, although only nine still retain that designation. Sixteen Presidents have created national monuments since the program began; only Richard Nixon, <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan,</b> <b>and</b> George H. W. Bush did not. Bill Clinton created nineteen and expanded three others. Jimmy Carter protected vast parts of Alaska, proclaiming fifteen national monuments, some of which later were promoted to national parks. President Barack Obama created or expanded 34 national monuments, {{the most of any}} president, with over half a billion acres of public land and water protected.|$|E
5|$|Ford reluctantly {{agreed to}} run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a {{challenge}} for the Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>and</b> the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijosâ€“Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.|$|E

5|$|On July 17, 1955, Disneyland and the Disneyland Railroad opened, and the {{day began}} with Walt Disney driving the DRR's No. 2 {{locomotive}} and its passenger train into Main Street, U.S.A. Station with California Governor Goodwin J. Knight and AT Railway President Fred G. Gurley riding in the locomotive's cab. They were greeted at the station's platform by the park opening ceremony's host Art Linkletter, actor <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan,</b> <b>and</b> several television camera crews broadcasting the festivities nationwide. After exiting the locomotive, Linkletter briefly interviewed Disney, Knight, and Gurley before they walked towards the town square in the Main Street, U.S.A. section where Disney officially dedicated Disneyland. The DRR eventually {{became one of the}} most popular steam-powered railroads in the world with an estimated 6.6 million passengers each year.|$|E

In addition to her husband and immediate family, former presidents <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>and</b> Gerald Ford and their wives, Nancy and Betty, were also in attendance. Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she was in the hospital recovering from a stroke, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend either. President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. It was a rare display of emotion from the former president, and Helen McCain Smith said that she had never seen him more distraught.|$|E
5|$|The world responded {{rapidly to}} the {{disaster}} in Leninakan and Spitak, {{with much of}} Europe sending cargo aircraft loaded with medical supplies, rescue equipment, and trained personnel {{to assist in the}} recovery, and even more reinforcement came in from Latin America and the Far East. Mikhail Gorbachev was in New York on his first day of visits with <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>and</b> George H. W.

Washington immediately responded with offers of doctors, medical equipment, and rescue teams, and by the first weekend the first US plane arrived in Yerevan with search and rescue teams and detection dogs.|$|E
