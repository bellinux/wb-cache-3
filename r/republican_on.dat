5|$|The Democrats {{nominated}} {{former governor}} and senator J. C. W. Beckham to challenge Sampson. The primary {{issue in the}} campaign was whether to outlaw parimutuel betting at the state's racetracks. Beckham favored the ban, while Sampson opposed it. A political machine known as the Jockey Club backed Sampson, and several key Democrats bolted the party after Beckham's nomination. Sampson won the governorship by over 32,000 votes, but every other <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> the ticket lost by small majorities. The results suggested that some carefully coordinated vote swapping had occurred to ensure Beckham's defeat, but none was ever proven.|$|E
5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, {{the ranking}} <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, {{sent a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have violated a federal statue that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity. On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations and acknowledged White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President Bill Clinton to offer Sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the operation of Mountain Grove Campground, the majority of people traveling there were worshipers. In the 1870s and 1880s, the campground was one of the three largest camp meeting sites that residents of Columbia County attended. In 1875, approximately 2500 people attended the camp meeting. In 1881, it was decided that all the profit generated from the campground would be dedicated to expansion and improvement of it. In 1891, the duration of the camp meeting was increased from seven to thirteen days. However, some people traveled there for a vacation. Within 20 years of the campground's opening, {{the majority of the people}} going there were there for a vacation, and trains carried bands and other entertainment-related items to the campground. However, people still continued to go there in large numbers for camp meeting. Local newspapers also began to advertise the campground as a resort instead of a camp meeting site. This began with an advertisement written by John R. Rote, secretary of the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association, in the Columbia County <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> July 9, 1891.|$|E

5|$|There {{were rumors}} that Joseph McClure, the Chief Justice who had sworn him into office, {{intended}} to have Baxter either arrested or killed, ostensibly because Baxter had replaced W. W. Wilshire, a Minstrel, with Robert C. Newton, an ex-Confederate, {{as head of}} the state militia. U.S. Attorney General Williams contacted Baxter and suggested that he ask for federal troops for protection again. A letter from President Grant followed, offering protection. The Grant administration usually followed Powell Clayton's lead where Arkansas matters were concerned, so it can be concluded that the former governor was still supporting Baxter. The Republican Party of Arkansas, still controlled by the Minstrel faction, issued a statement denouncing Brooks' attempt to contest the election, which was published in the Little Rock <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> October 8, 1873 and signed by all the major members of the party, including Clayton. However, the Minstrels would soon turn on Baxter for not following the party line.|$|E

During the Iran–Iraq war of the 1980s, Frenzel was a proponent of economic ties to the regime of Saddam Hussein, and opposed congressional efforts to condemn Iraqi war crimes such as the infamous Halabja chemical attack, the deadliest chemical-weapons attack in history, on the grounds that they would disrupt future trade with Iraq. He also served as vice chairman of the Committee on House Administration, and vice chairman of the Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards.
