5|$|However, Thio Li-ann {{believes}} that it is undesirable that {{the law does not}} impose a timeframe for the calling of by-elections. If a by-election is not called promptly upon a parliamentary seat falling vacant, the electors in the GRC in question will be represented to a lesser extent. This is particularly pertinent where more than one MP vacates his or her seat or when the seat vacated is that of a minority candidate. Should the latter situation arise, the <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> the GRC scheme – to guarantee minority representation in Parliament – would be defeated.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{coauthor}} John Cook won the 2011 Eureka Prize for Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge, {{awarded by}} the New South Wales Government {{as part of}} the Australian Museum Eureka Prizes, and was honoured for his role in communicating the essence of climate change science to the general public. Director of the University of Queensland Global Change Institute, Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, cited Cook's research and authorship of Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand as the <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> him winning the award.|$|E
5|$|Over 50% of MS {{patients}} may use complementary and alternative medicine, although numbers vary greatly {{depending on the}} definition of alternative medicine used. In the United States, {{it is estimated that}} 75% of the MS patient populations use at least one complementary and alternative medicine for treatment and symptomatic control. The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. The <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D.|$|E

25|$|One of the <b>rationales</b> <b>behind</b> demonstrating {{and later}} formalizing Managed Medicare into Part C of Medicare {{had been the}} {{expectation}} that the introduction of competition among the participating insurance companies would provide higher-quality care and plans that were more responsive to beneficiaries' needs than traditional Medicare, at similar or lower cost.|$|R
50|$|Registration is costly; however, {{once the}} trade-mark is registered, proving an {{infringement}} is easier and therefore possibly {{less expensive than}} a common law passing-off action.

5|$|President Bush's legacy {{continues}} to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to {{his handling of the}} Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George W.

5|$|Meanwhile, DCP Prabhakar and Sub-inspector Chari, who is Ambi's friend, {{investigate}} the murders committed by Anniyan. In disguises, they discover clues {{left behind by}} Anniyan, which are {{the names of the}} punishments he meted out to his victims. Prabhakar is determined to bring Anniyan to justice as one of Anniyan's victims, Chockalingam, an errant catering contractor with the Indian Railways, was his elder brother. In a dramatic publicity stunt, Anniyan admits to the murders he committed when he appears amidst the public and the press at the Nehru Stadium. He explains the <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> them and says that only when every Indian is responsible and sincere will the country prosper on a par with developed nations. His methods draw both praise and criticism. Prabhakar tries to catch Anniyan, but he escapes.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name Panthers is uncertain. One {{of the most widely}} known {{theories}} is that the club were named for a squadron of Canadian airmen based near Nottingham during World War II. However, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that such a squadron existed and records indicate that the name was coined before these events could have taken place. A souvenir brochure produced to mark of the opening of the Ice Stadium in April 1939 stated that the venue's new team would be known as the Nottingham Panthers. It does not, however, explain the <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> the name. Three games were played by teams using the name Nottingham Panthers during the winter of 1939–40 before the name was revived in 1946.|$|E

40|$|Soil {{fertility}} enhancing technologies (SFETs) {{have been}} promoted in the West African Semi-Arid Tropics (WASAT) {{for many years}} with limited success. Using a qualitative approach of focus group discussions, long, openended interviews and observations from field visits, this paper explores with farmers their beliefs and <b>rationales</b> <b>behind</b> the adoption or non-adoption of SFETs. Farmers are knowledgeable about, and practise SFETs of rock phosphate application, crop residue and farm yard manure, chemical fertilizer and crop rotation to combat soil fertility decline. Their attitudes to and <b>rationales</b> <b>behind</b> adoption decisions {{are influenced by the}} availability and use policies of land and labour resources, food security concerns, perceived profitability, contribution to sustainability and access to information. Some of the factors are beyond farmers’ control and require a broad and integrated effort from research, extension and government to promote the use of the SFETs in the region...|$|R

5|$|When Richard died, {{his brother}} John – Henry’s fifth and only {{surviving}} son – took the throne. In 1204 John {{lost much of}} the Angevins' continental territories, including Anjou, to the French crown. He and his successors were still recognized as dukes of Aquitaine. The loss of Anjou from which the dynasty is named is the <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> John's sonHenry III of England being considered the first Plantageneta name derived from the nickname of his great-grandfather, Geoffrey. Where no distinction is made between the Angevinsand Angevin era and subsequent English Kings, Henry II is the first Plantagenet king. From John the dynasty continued successfully and unbroken in the senior male line until the reign of Richard II before dividing into two competing cadet branches, the House of Lancaster and the House of York.|$|E
5|$|When the SI {{standard}} {{was published in}} 1960, the only major Commonwealth country to have adopted the metric system was India. In 1863, the first reading of {{a bill that would}} have made the metric system compulsory passed its first reading in the House of Commons by 110 votes to 75. The bill, however, failed to make the statute book because of lack of parliamentary time. In 1965, after this and similar false starts the then Federation of British Industry informed the British Government that its members favoured the adoption of the metric system. The <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> the request was that 80% of British exports were to countries that used the metric system or that were considering changing to the metric system. The Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. The government agreed to a voluntary policy requiring minimal legislation and costs to be borne where they fell. SI would be used from the outset. The rest of the Commonwealth, South Africa and Ireland followed within a few years; in some countries such as South Africa and Australia metrication was mandatory rather than voluntary.|$|E

40|$|This Note {{discusses}} a securities disclosure issue {{stemming from}} a split between the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit. The question presented is whether failure {{to comply with a}} disclosure requirement created by Item 303 of Regulation S-K can provide a basis for liability under section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10 b- 5. The Ninth Circuit held that such violation does not provide a basis for liability. Conversely, in Stratte-McClure v. Morgan Stanley, the Second Circuit explicitly disagreed with the Ninth Circuit and concluded that this violation may serve as a basis for liability. This Note examines the <b>rationales</b> <b>behind</b> each decision, as well as the <b>rationales</b> <b>behind</b> disclosure regulations more generally, and ultimately concludes that Item 303 violations should serve as a basis for 10 b- 5 liability, as long as all of the remaining requirements of a 10 b- 5 claim are met...|$|R
25|$|Unlike other United Nations {{specialized}} agencies, the International Labour Organization has a tripartite governing structure – representing governments, employers, {{and workers}} (usually with {{a ratio of}} 2:1:1).

25|$|It {{is argued}} that the <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> this law is that an iambic word at the {{beginning}} of the third metron might give the false impression that the line had come to an end.

During the early Cold War, this policy was maintained even though Sweden's leaders understood that neutrality would probably fail in a third world war.

25|$|Careful {{matching}} of {{the discount}} rate to the appropriate measure of economic income {{is critical to the}} accuracy of the business valuation results. Net cash flow is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or CAPM models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, {{the discount rate}}s are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.|$|E

This was expressed algebraically as having a cost of N, and a value of N². While the actual numbers behind this definition were never firm, the concept allowed customers to share access to expensive resources like disk drives and printers, send e-mail, and access the Internet.|$|E
