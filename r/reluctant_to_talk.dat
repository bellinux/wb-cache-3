5|$|Murray {{grew up in}} Dunblane and {{attended}} Dunblane Primary School. He and his brother were present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover in a classroom. Murray says {{he was too young}} to understand what was happening and is <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it in interviews, but in his autobiography Hitting Back he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car. Murray later attended Dunblane High School.|$|E
5|$|Merrick {{settled into}} {{his new life}} at the London Hospital. Treves visited him daily and {{spent a couple of}} hours with him every Sunday. Now that Merrick had found someone who {{understood}} his speech, he was delighted to carry on long conversations with the doctor. Treves and Merrick built a friendly relationship, although Merrick never completely confided in him. He told Treves that he was an only child, and Treves had the impression that Merrick's mother, whose picture Merrick always carried with him, had abandoned him as a baby. Merrick was also <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about his exhibition days, although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers. It did not take Treves long to realise that, contrary to his initial impressions, Merrick was not intellectually impaired.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{approaches}} {{some of the}} Kindred, only to be shunned. Meanwhile, Scully befriends a member, Brother Andrew (Brent Hinkley), who is <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> While {{shaking hands}} with him, Scully appears entranced, not coming to until Mulder catches her attention. The agents visit the Kindred's remote community, where {{they are asked to}} surrender their guns before entering. Mulder and Scully are invited to dinner. When the Kindred refuse to allow Scully to treat Brother Aaron, a sick participant at the table, Brother Andrew states that the Kindred take care of their own. Meanwhile, in another nightclub, a man convinces a girl to dance with him by touching her hand.|$|E
5|$|P.E. Svinhufvud's Senate {{proposed}} Finland's {{declaration of}} independence, which the Parliament adopted on 6 December 1917. The Social Democrats {{voted against the}} Senate's proposal while presenting an alternative declaration for sovereignty. The establishment of an independent state was not a foregone conclusion for the small Finnish nation; recognition by Russia and the European powers was essential. Svinhufvud accepted, {{that he had to}} negotiate with Lenin for Russian recognition. The socialists, <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talks</b> with the Russian leadership in July 1917, sent two delegations to Petrograd to ask Lenin to approve Finnish sovereignty.|$|R

The Times of India has listed her as one of [...] "Bollywood's hottest vegetarian celebrities". She was also named as the [...] "hottest vegetarian of 2015" [...] by PETA [...] [...] She is an avid practitioner of Transcendental Meditation. Sharma has confessed to being a victim of anxiety disorder and seeking treatment for it. As of September 2015, Sharma is {{in a relationship with}} cricketer Virat Kohli. Their relationship has attracted substantial media coverage in India, though she is <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> openly <b>talk</b> about it.|$|R
5000|$|The talks {{did not go}} well. The Native leaders felt {{emboldened by}} major {{victories}} over the United States in 1790 and 1791. They were suspicious that the talks were not being held in good faith, {{and some of them}} were accordingly hostile. Their misgivings were justified in that General [...] "Mad Anthony" [...] Wayne was training an army of more than 4,600 troops at the same time. The American government representatives were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> attend the <b>talks</b> for fear of their safety. Eventually, the efforts failed and the Quaker peace riders returned to Philadelphia to report at the Yearly Meeting. Hostilities followed the failed talks, the American government won a decisive victory in the Battle of Fallen Timbers in August 1794, and the wholesale settlement of the Ohio Territory ensued.|$|R
25|$|Unlike other mob bosses {{who were}} remote and <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to outsiders, Salerno was very accessible. Mafiosi from Cleveland, Philadelphia, New England, Buffalo {{and other cities}} would visit Salerno to talk about various {{internal}} problems they wanted resolved. Salerno preferred a low-key existence and led an unpretentious life. He was never spotted at glitzy mob parties, nightclubs or other popular Mafia bistros. He even sent out Christmas cards {{with a picture of}} himself in pajamas on the front cover.|$|E
25|$|The next year, the Eagles again {{earned a}} wild-card spot and then won their first post-merger playoff game over the Chicago Bears before falling to Tampa Bay. Following that season, the Giants traded Pisarcik {{to them for}} a draft choice. He would finish {{his career as a}} backup to Ron Jaworski five years later. His entire NFL career is usually {{embodied}} in that play, and while he is sometimes <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it, he admits that at least people remember his name thanks to it.|$|E
25|$|Two {{documentary}} {{films are}} known to have been made in north-eastern Portugal where present day descendants of marranos were interviewed about their lives. In 1974 for The Marranos of Portugal, the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) sent reporter Ron Ben-Yishai to carry out interviews with families about their religious practice. After being asked to prove he knew Hebrew before they would talk, he found people still <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> openly but did eventually gain a remarkable insight into their version of Jewish customs, prayers and songs. The film was commended at the 1976 Jerusalem Jewish Film and TV Festival. Another documentary, The Last Marranos, was made by the New York Jewish Media Fund in 1997.|$|E

5000|$|Ashley Funicello Spinelli (voiced by Pamela Adlon): Spinelli going {{simply by}} {{her last name}} Spinelli, is a wrestling fan and is the tomboy of the group. Although small for her age, Spinelli {{maintains}} a tough-guy image, is strong and often tries to use violence to solve her problems. During the gang's endeavors, Spinelli {{is the one who}} gets <b>reluctant</b> kids <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> usually by threatening or intimidating them. With her reputation, a lot of Spinelli's problems happen when she is shown to have a weakness, as she prefers to be feared and respected. While she doesn't dislike her first name since she was named after her great aunt, the first woman to win the Iditarod Sled Race, she kept it hidden because she {{does not want to be}} associated with [...] "The Ashleys", a clique of snooty popular girls. She has a talent for art, though she claims she [...] "only does it to blow off steam". Her aggressive and tough personality has gotten on the good side of Miss Finster multiple times. She secretly has a crush on T. J. and speaks with a frontal lisp.|$|R

500|$|Mara Carfagna has posed nude for Maxim. <b>Reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{about her}} {{modeling}} past, she has nevertheless {{suggested that she}} had certain reservations about the work. On one occasion she said: [...] "I am {{a bit of a}} prude and I found getting undressed {{in front of a camera}} not a pleasant experience." [...] She states that she is a firm believer in family values, and claimed in an interview that she once refused to take part in a movie directed by erotic filmmaker Tinto Brass, when she was twenty years old.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Germany he led a normal life, <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about his time in Auschwitz. However, more than 40 years later, he decided to make his {{activities}} at Auschwitz public after learning about Holocaust denial. He has since openly criticised those who deny the events that he witnessed, and the ideology to which he once subscribed. The recorded accounts he provided to the BBC, however, contributed to the decision and ability to prosecute him. [...] His record as an activist against Holocaust deniers since 1985 was not taken into consideration. Gröning has been notable as a German willing to make public statements about his experience as an SS soldier, which are self-incriminating and have exposed his life to public scrutiny.|$|E

500|$|Born in Newcastle, New South Wales on 5June 1917, Nigel Cullen {{was the son}} of Horace David Cullen (originally Horace David Cohen) and {{his wife}} Hero. The boy's uncle was future Major General Paul Alfred Cullen. [...] Nigel was taken to England at an early age by his parents and {{attended}} Sherborne School in Dorset, before studying at the College of Aero Engineering, Chelsea. Fired by a love of adventure, he competed in motorbike racing at Brooklands in 1934, and later saw action {{as a member of the}} International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War, suffering a wound to the stomach that necessitated repatriation to England. When he caught up again with his friends from Brooklands, he was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the conflict except to say that [...] "the wars of the future would be fought in the air".|$|E
500|$|In 1961, Barr became General Manager of Meggitt Ltd, an oilseed-crushing firm; he {{eventually}} rose to become Executive Chairman. The firm's board was joined in 1971 by the recently retired Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sir Alister Murdoch. Barr's {{work in the}} industry led to his appointment in the 1983 New Year Honours as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). The same year, he became Australian representative and Chairman of the International Oil Seed Group. In June 1987, Barr accepted an invitation to join John Glenn, Chuck Yeager, and fifteen other famed flyers in a so-called [...] "Gathering of Eagles" [...] for a seminar at the USAF Air Command and Staff College in Montgomery, Alabama. Generally <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> publicly about the war, he agreed to discuss his experiences during an episode of the television series Australian Story in 2002, appearing with his biographer Peter Dornan, and Bobby Gibbes. By this time Barr {{was said to be}} receiving daily treatment for the injuries he had suffered in combat. He {{died at the age of}} ninety on 12June 2006, a few months after his wife. Four F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters from No.3 Squadron overflew his funeral service on the Gold Coast, Queensland. He was further honoured at a rugby test match between Australia and England at Telstra Dome in Melbourne on 17June, the day after his funeral. On 14 September 2006, No.3 Squadron dedicated a stone memorial in Barr's honour; the unveiling was attended by his sons Bob and Brian.|$|E

Trevor Chappell remains best remembered for the [...] "Underarm '81" [...] incident.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} feature, {{compared to}} other Danish parties, is that the Danish People's Party is usually underrepresented by about 1-1.5% in opinion polls. Election researchers {{have suggested that the}} party's voters may be less interested in politics, and therefore declining <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> pollsters, or that voters are <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> reveal their support for the party to pollsters.|$|R

Also, at that time, information from our surveillance was not admissible in court. As a result, no federal charges were filed in the '60s." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1906, Albert Stevens Crockett, a young {{reporter}} for the New York Herald, interviewed Stodder, who was retired and living in New York, the last surviving officer of the Monitor. Stodder was initially <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about himself, so it took some persuading by Crockett to get Stodder to provide a first-hand account of the Monitors history. Stodder's hair and mustache were now white, but Crockett noted that the former officer was still [...] "erect of figure and had the air and voice of a strict disciplinarian, though with {{a keen sense of}} humor and an enjoyment of life." [...] Stodder's account helped historians piece together the story of the short-lived Monitor.|$|E
2500|$|The cast were reunited in 1975 for a BBC radio {{adaptation}} of series 1, transmitted on Radio 4 from July to October that year. In 1976, {{a feature film}} spin-off was made. Around {{the time of its}} release, however, Rodney Bewes and James Bolam fell out over a misunderstanding involving the press and have not spoken since. This long-suspected situation was finally confirmed by Bewes while promoting his autobiography in 2005. Unlike Bewes, Bolam is consistently <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the show, and has vetoed any attempt to revive his character.The final breach, as Bewes told it, occurred after Bolam's wife, Sue, announced to her husband, while he was driving, that she was pregnant. He almost crashed the car. Bewes repeated this story in a newspaper interview, thinking that it was already public knowledge, then got a frosty reaction when he rang Bolam to forewarn him. [...] "There was this dreadful silence. He put the phone down. I called him back. He didn't answer. He hasn't spoken to me since", Bewes claimed. }} ...|$|E
25|$|The Turks, {{despite the}} terms of the treaty, were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> {{evacuate}} Batumi and continued its occupation. Fearing permanent loss of the city to Turkey, Georgian leaders agreed <b>to</b> <b>talks</b> with the Revkom. In Kutaisi, Georgian Defense Minister Grigol Lordkipanidze and the Soviet plenipotentiary Avel Enukidze arranged an armistice on 17 March, and then, on 18 March, an agreement which allowed the Red Army to advance in force to Batumi.|$|R
50|$|Since the incident, the South Korean {{government}} has been <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> engage in further diplomacy with North Korea over disputes such as North Korea's nuclear weapons program.

5000|$|Social control {{promotes}} {{and encourages}} conformity among informal group members, thereby making them <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> act too aggressively or perform at {{too high a}} level. This can harm the formal organization by stifling initiative, creativity, and diversity of performance. In some British factories, if a group member gets [...] "out of line", tools may be hidden, air may be let out of tires, and other group members may refuse <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the deviant for days or weeks. Obviously, these types of actions can force a good worker to leave the organization.|$|R
2500|$|In part {{these changes}} were an {{increased}} awareness of how important news media were to Labour's election campaign. [...] One party press secretary said, of Labour's attitude {{to the news media}} in the 1983 general election campaign, that [...] "If a miracle had happened and Fleet Street had suddenly come clamouring to Walworth Road for pro-Labour material, they would have been sent away with a copy of the manifesto each." [...] The party leadership noted afterwards that it had been the effect of the [...] "Loony Left" [...] image that had caused it to lose the 1987 Greenwich by-election by such a large margin. [...] This is not to say, of course, that Labour ignored the press. [...] However, it became <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to it. [...] Kinnock refused to talk to the press on the flight back from his visit to the US President Ronald Reagan after British journalists had continually sought a story that would represent the trip in a negative light. [...] Similarly, Patricia Hewitt, then party press secretary, considered abandoning holding daily press conferences {{in the run-up to the}} 1987 general election, because [...] "they allow the newspaper journalists to set the agenda [...] and we know where they stand".|$|E
2500|$|Lynch {{is known}} for being <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the media. He was fined $50,000 by the NFL for refusing {{to talk to the}} media {{throughout}} the 2013 NFL season, which inspired fans of the Seattle Seahawks to fundraise that amount. However, the fine was subsequently pulled back in an agreement that he would be fined another $50,000 if he broke the same rule, after which he donated the money raised by Seahawks fans to pay his fine to charity. Lynch was fined $100,000 on November 19, 2014, for once again refusing to speak to the media. A few days later, after the Seahawks win over Arizona, he answered nearly every question from reporters with [...] "Yeah". On December 21, 2014, after the second Seahawks-Cardinals game, he answered nearly every question from reporters with some version of [...] "Thanks for asking" [...] or [...] "I appreciate you asking." [...] The only people to get an [...] "extended interview" [...] were Deion Sanders, former teammate turned analyst Michael Robinson, and Michael Silver, in which they discovered his reluctance came from his upbringing {{and the fact that he}} felt that he was [...] "forced to do something." [...] On January 27, 2015, during Super Bowl Media Day in Glendale, Arizona, Lynch continued the trend of declining to give detailed media interviews by showing up for five minutes, and answering every question with some variation of [...] "I'm just here so I won't get fined," [...] and the following day [...] "You know why I'm here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Obama's election, many {{pondered the}} {{existence}} of a [...] "postracial America." [...] However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent, and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as [...] "racial venom" [...] directed at Obama's presidency. In July 2009, prominent African-American Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., was arrested at his Cambridge, Massachusetts home by a local police officer, sparking a controversy after Obama stated that the police acted [...] "stupidly" [...] in handling the incident. To reduce tensions, Obama invited Gates and the police officer to the White House in {{what became known as the}} [...] "Beer Summit". Several other incidents during Obama's presidency sparked outrage in the African-American community and/or the law enforcement community, and Obama sought to build trust between law enforcement officials and civil rights activists. The acquittal of George Zimmerman following the shooting of Trayvon Martin sparked national outrage, leading to Obama giving a speech in which he noted that [...] "Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago." [...] The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri sparked a wave of protests. These and other events led to the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement, which campaigns against violence and systemic racism toward black people. Some in the law enforcement community criticized Obama's condemnation of racial bias after incidents in which police action led to the death of African-American men, while some racial justice activists criticized Obama's expressions of empathy for the police. Though Obama entered office <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about race, by 2014 he began openly discussing the disadvantages faced by many members of minority groups. In a March 2016 Gallup poll, nearly one third of Americans said they worried [...] "a great deal" [...] about race relations, a higher figure than in any previous Gallup poll since 2001.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP hired Elisabeth Freeman, a women's {{suffrage}} activist from New York City, {{to investigate}} the lynching. She had traveled to Texas in late 1915 or early 1916 to help organize the suffrage movement there. After attending a suffrage convention in Dallas in early May, she began her assignment in Waco, posing as a journalist and attempting to interview people about the lynching. She found that almost all residents were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> discuss the event. She spoke with town officials and obtained pictures of the lynching from Gildersleeve, who was initially <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> provide them. Although she feared for her safety, she enjoyed {{the challenge of the}} investigation. When speaking with city leaders, Freeman convinced them that she planned to defend Waco against criticism when she returned to the north. Some journalists soon grew suspicious of her presence and warned residents not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> outsiders. Local African Americans, however, gave her a warm reception.|$|R

After helping Roxy pack up her belongings, she visits Ronnie and Jack, {{and with a}} <b>reluctant</b> Ronnie, tries <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> Roxy out of moving to Portugal. They fail, and Roxy walks out on them both. Glenda encounters Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), and when Ronnie tells her Claudette's story that Phil's father Eric Mitchell murdered Claudette's husband, Glenda claims that Claudette must be lying. Glenda leaves after {{a phone call from}} Danny. She returns in May, looking for Roxy, as she has borrowed £3,000 from her and Danny before disappearing. Glenda and Ronnie visit Roxy in hospital, as she has been beaten up, but find she has discharged herself. When she does return, Roxy reveals she needs money to escape drug lords, which Ronnie pays her. Glenda admits to Roxy she would not have returned if Roxy had not taken her money, leading Roxy to offer her £5,000, on the condition she does not return. Glenda takes the money and leaves, to Ronnie's disappointment, though Ronnie does not know Roxy has paid her.|$|R
