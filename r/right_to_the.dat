Spain also ceded {{the rights to the}} lucrative asiento (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{about the}} succession, Henry sought to persuade Louis VI {{to accept his}} son, William Adelin, as the {{legitimate}} future Duke of Normandy, {{in exchange for his}} son's homage. Henry crossed into Normandy in 1115 and assembled the Norman barons to swear loyalty; he also almost successfully negotiated a settlement with King Louis, affirming William's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Duchy in exchange for a large sum of money, but the deal fell through and Louis, backed by his ally Baldwin of Flanders, instead declared that he considered William Clito the legitimate heir to the Duchy.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of King Edward VI on 6July 1553, John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, who had led the young King's {{government}} {{for the last three}} and a half years, tried to install his daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey on the English throne; she was the King's Protestant cousin to whom Edward had willed the Crown, bypassing his half-sisters Mary and Elizabeth. When Mary Tudor asserted her <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne, an expedition against her base in East Anglia became inevitable. Northumberland marched on 14July, accompanied by his eldest sons, John and Ambrose. Five days later the Privy Council changed sides; on hearing this on 20July, Northumberland, who had been staying at Cambridge, gave up and was arrested with his party the next day.|$|E
5|$|Apart from organising the federation, Welensky won a {{significant}} political battle in Northern Rhodesia against the British South Africa Company (BSAC), which controlled mineral {{rights and the}} associated royalties throughout the territory. The company, and not the British crown, had signed the treaties with African kings that surrendered mining rights, but the BSAC had stopped administering Northern Rhodesia in 1924. Welensky argued that the territory had a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> royalties, and petitioned the governor to take action. After many talks, the BSAC relented and agreed to surrender mineral rights in 1986, and to pay 20% of its profits from these rights to the government until then.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800, Europeans began {{settling}} the land {{east of the}} Mississippi River that was inhabited by the Chickasaw Indians for centuries prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans. Chickasaw land in West Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky was ceded in the Jackson Purchase after negotiations in which the United States was represented by General Andrew Jackson and Governor Isaac Shelby, while the Chickasaw were represented by their chiefs and warriors. In 1818, both sides agreed to the transfer by signing the Treaty of Tuscaloosa. In the treaty, the United States agreed to pay the Chickasaw $300,000 in return for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> land east of the Mississippi River and north of the Mississippi state line.|$|E

5|$|At this time, private loyalty-review {{boards and}} anti-communist {{investigators}} {{began to appear}} to fill a growing demand among certain industries to certify that their employees were above reproach. Companies that {{were concerned about the}} sensitivity of their business, or who, like the entertainment industry, felt particularly vulnerable to public opinion made use of these private services. For a fee, these teams would investigate employees and question them about their politics and affiliations. At such hearings, the subject would usually not have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presence of an attorney, and as with HUAC, the interviewee might be asked to defend himself against accusations without being allowed to cross-examine the accuser. These agencies would keep cross-referenced lists of leftist organizations, publications, rallies, charities and the like, as well as lists of individuals who were known or suspected communists. Books such as Red Channels and newsletters such as Counterattack and Confidential Information were published to keep track of communist and leftist organizations and individuals. Insofar as the various blacklists of McCarthyism were actual physical lists, they were created and maintained by these private organizations.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Bayer was facing competition in all its major markets from local ASA producers {{as well as other}} German drug firms (particularly Heyden and Hoechst). The British market was immediately closed to the German companies, but British manufacturing could not meet the demand‚Äîespecially with phenol supplies, necessary for ASA synthesis, largely being used for explosives manufacture. On 5 February 1915, Bayer's UK trademarks were voided, so that any company could use the term aspirin. The Australian market was taken over by Aspro, after the makers of Nicholas-Aspirin lost a short-lived exclusive <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aspirin name there. In the United States, Bayer was still under German control‚Äîthough the war disrupted the links between the American Bayer plant and the German Bayer headquarters‚Äîbut phenol shortage threatened to reduce aspirin production to a trickle, and imports across the Atlantic Ocean were blocked by the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|Charlton {{received}} treatment midway {{throughout the}} second half after he ran into a photographer chasing an over-hit pass. Leeds had an attack soon after, but after Storrie received the ball from Bremner, his pass went behind the Liverpool goal. Liverpool had more chances, but St. John slipped at the back post when a Callaghan cross was diverted towards him. Then Thompson saw a shot saved by Sprake. Leeds reacted to the increased pressure, by moving Bremner to centre-forward and Giles reverting to midfield. Johanneson switched positions with Storrie, moving from the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left. Liverpool continued to press for a winner as the half drew to a close, but Thompson and Strong saw shots saved by Sprake. Neither team managed to score before full-time and the match went to extra time, {{the first time this}} happened since the 1947 final.|$|E

5|$|Considering that he {{majored in}} {{political}} science and economics, Kan≈ç's family thought that after graduating from university, he would pursue a career in some government ministry. Indeed, through influential friends of his father's, he was initially offered a position with the Ministry of Finance. However, his love for teaching led him instead to accept a position teaching at Gakushuin. The students of Japan's elite attended Gakushuin and were of higher social positions than their teachers. The students were allowed to ride in rickshaws (jinrikisha) <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> doors of the classes, whereas teachers were forbidden. The teachers often felt compelled to visit the homes of these students whenever summoned to give instruction or advice. In effect, the teachers were treated as servants.|$|E
5|$|Grace's final {{appearance}} in 1878 {{was for the}} USEE against Twenty of Essex in a two-day match at Witham, starting on Friday, 13 September. The game was played {{for the benefit of}} the Essex and USEE stalwart Frank Silcock. Essex at this time was not a first-class club but capable of providing the USEE with a stern test, especially with odds in their favour, and they had by far the best of a drawn game. Essex scored 175 and 235; USEE replied with 134 and 65‚Äì5, so Essex would almost certainly have won with more time. Grace starred with the ball and took a total of 26 wickets. But his indifferent form with the bat haunted him <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of the season and he could only score 10 and 4.|$|E
5|$|Humphreys, a Naval captain, {{had married}} Maria Davenport in 1810, and lived at Bramall Hall {{long before he}} succeeded his father-in-law. He became widely {{respected}} in the Stockport area, but following his succession to the estate in 1829, there were disputes from {{other members of the}} Davenport family who claimed a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> property. Edmund Davenport, who claimed ancestry from Thomas Davenport, the third son of Peter, unsuccessfully contested the succession in two different courts; Edmund was eventually imprisoned for failing to pay the legal fees. Humphreys was knighted in 1834 for his services, and in 1838 changed his name to Davenport, in an effort to continue the Davenport line. He moved with Maria to Cheltenham in 1841, most likely because living at Bramall had become expensive or because of health concerns. Salusbury died there four years later and was buried in Leckhampton.|$|E
