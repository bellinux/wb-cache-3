50|$|Valve {{timing and}} the valve profile are {{continuously}} altered according to conditions and engine load. For improved responsiveness on cold starts, VarioCam Plus raises {{the amount of}} lift and <b>retards</b> <b>valve</b> timing. At medium revs with minimal loads, the valve lift is lowered and timing advanced to help minimize fuel consumption and emissions. For maximum power and torque, the lift is raised and the timing is advanced. This system debuted on the 1999 Porsche 996 Turbo.|$|R
50|$|From 1911 to 1914 Scott's Tourist Trophy racers used {{rotary valves}} {{to control the}} inlet and {{transfer}} phases of the two-stroke cycle. In 1911 the engine was controlled by advancing or <b>retarding</b> the <b>valve</b> timing and not by the throttle. Scott reverted to throttle control in 1912, giving the rotary valves a fixed gear drive in the same year.|$|R

25|$|A {{facelift}} in July 1976 saw the four-door saloon {{replaced with}} a five-door hatchback. Peugeot had been afraid that a five-door 104 would steal sales from the old-fashioned 204 Break, but with production of the 204 {{coming to an end}} in July 1976 this was no longer a concern. Rear light clusters were modified slightly with indicators that wrapped around to the sides of the car, and a 1.1-litre engine was also made available. The coupé was made available in two versions, the ZL and also the more powerful ZS with 66PS. A modified camshaft on the 954cc engines also <b>retarded</b> the <b>valve</b> timing in order to favour fuel economy at the price of a slight power reduction. The revised models only appeared in right-hand drive form {{at the end of the}} year. 1977 proved to be the most successful year for the 104, with 190,000 being built.|$|R
40|$|A new {{hydraulic}} {{cam follower}} with {{variable valve timing}} (VVT) properties is described. Experimental {{results show that the}} point of closure of the valve may be delayed as a linear function of engine speed without external control. No other parameter of the valve event is modified by the device. An obvious application is the control of intake valve timing for engines with a wide speed range, where the point of valve closure could be scheduled with engine speed in order to maximise the trapped mass, hence improving the torque curve at low and high speeds. The device is considered for application to the Ford 2. 5 litre DI diesel engine, where it may be used to <b>retard</b> inlet <b>valve</b> closure from close to bottom dead centre (BDC) at cranking speed to 50 - 60 deg after BDC at rated speed. This reduces the compromise in inlet valve timing across the speed range, thereby improving starting or allowing a small reduction of compression ratio, and improving the volumetric efficiency at low and high speeds. An experimental program is reported which consists of rig and engine work based on the Ford 2. 5 litre DI diesel engine. The engine testing shows that the device may be operated quietly, albeit on a diesel engine, and reliably over a wide speed range. The device is seen to be sensitive to oil inlet temperature such that when cold, measures are required to prevent late inlet valve closure...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, many {{researchers}} have conducted experimental and simulation studies using alternative fuels for internal combustion engine. There are many types of existing alternative fuels {{can be used in}} internal combustion engine, but the fundamental information about their combustion process is still limited due to difficulties in developing the experimental work. This study focus on the performance of methane fuelled engine and optimize it by varying the cam timing angle for both intake and exhaust valves. The engine performance was measured on the brake torque, brake power, brake mean effective pressure (Bmep) and incylinder peak pressure. The engine model was developed based on Modenas Kriss 110 cc 4 -stroke single cylinder gasoline engine. CATIA software was used in developing the 3 D engine model and followed by utilization of GT-Suite software in analyzing the engine performance. The engine performance results for methane fuelled engine were found to be lower at about 20. 1 % for engine torque, brake power and bmep and 12. 0 % for in-cylinder peak pressure when compared to gasoline engine. In the case of different valve timing, it was found that <b>retarding</b> the exhaust <b>valve</b> open timing at about 10 ° would produce the highest brake power in the range 5 – 10 %. From these results it can be concluded that the methane fuel produced lower engine performance compared to gasoline and different cam timing angle is required for methane fueled engine...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{malformation}} in connexin 43 (CX 43) -disrupted mice {{is restricted}} to the junction between right ventricle and outflow tract, even though CX 43 is also expressed abundantly elsewhere. We analyzed cardiac morphogenesis in immunohistochemically and hybridohistochemically stained and three-dimensionally reconstructed serial sections of CX 43 -deficient embryos between embryonic day (ED) 10 and birth. The establishment of the D configuration in the ascending loop of CX 43 -deficient hearts is markedly retarded, so that the right ventricle retains a craniomedial position and is connected with the outflow tract by a more acute bend in ED 10 and ED 11 embryos. Because of the subsequent growth of the right ventricle, this condition usually evolves into a D loop, but when it persists, a "crisscross" configuration develops, with the atrioventricular cushions rotated 90 degrees, a horizontal muscular ventricular septum, and a parallel course of the endocardial ridges of the outflow tract. After ED 12, large intertrabecular pouches develop at the ventricular side of both shelflike myocardial structures that support the endocardial ridges of the outflow tract, ie, at the location that was earlier characterized by the acute bend between the right ventricle and the outflow tract and that subsequently develops into the anterosuperior leaflet of the tricuspid <b>valve.</b> <b>Retarded</b> development of the D configuration in the ascending loop of the embryonic heart predisposes the myocardium at the junction of the right ventricle and outflow tract to excessive development of intertrabecular pouches during subsequent developmen...|$|R
40|$|This paper concludes the {{preliminary}} {{findings of a}} study on the effects of valve timing and manifold air temperature on the combustion performance of a 60 % downsized, turbocharged and supercharged SI engine. Experimental data was gathered on a 4 cylinder, 2. 0 litre prototype engine running at 1000 rpm, λ= 1 with a constant intake manifold pressure of 2200 mbar(A) and a targeted exhaust manifold pressure of 1250 mbar. A hybrid experimental approach using Design of Experiments theory guided by 1 D simulation predictions was used to derive an efficient experimental procedure using Matlab’s Model Based Calibration (MBC) toolbox in order to minimise the volume of testing required to characterise the engine behaviour at this condition. Experimental data was used to produce empirical models for engine responses such as torque, BSFC and NOx emissions and IMEP coefficient of variance (CoV). The model inputs were intake and exhaust cam phasing, manifold air temperature and spark advance. It was found that quadratic approximations for all of the responses modelled provided acceptable model fit in terms of statistical metrics such as R 2, RMSE and PRESS equivalents. Optimisation studies based on the empirical models to determine the locations of best engine performance in terms of the responses modelled were completed. A maximum torque of 416 Nm was predicted at the condition of maximum intake cam advance and exhaust cam <b>retard</b> (maximum <b>valve</b> overlap). This was attributable to an observed peak in engine airflow, a result of favourable manifold pressure pulsation interactions between cylinders. BSFC and at this point was found to be 365 g/kWh. As expected, manifold air temperatures of 28 °C (coldest tested) were predicted to give the best torque performance due to the improved volumetric efficiency and combustion phasing achievable with colder charge temperatures. A minimum bsfc of 219 g/kWh was predicted to occur in the region of 0 ° intake cam advance and 28 ° exhaust cam retard (from maximum opening points of 150 °aTDC and 126 °bTDC respectively). This gain in BSFC however comes at the cost of a 150 Nm drop in brake torque. The reduction in torque output was due to a reduction in engine airflow (a response largely dictated by intake cam phasing). However improved scavenging of exhaust gas residuals and an in-cylinder mixture closer to λ = 1 are likely to have improved combustion efficiency at this point, resulting in a proportionally better BSFC. Small changes in the available combustion parameters have been shown to have significant impact on the combustion behaviour leading to trade-offs in performance and efficiency. Optimisation studies for NOx emissions were also performed, the results of which shall be discussed herein...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} past, the Diesel engine has been {{improved}} considerably {{in the areas}} of performance, fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions. In Europe, these improvements have resulted in a strong increase in the sales of passenger cars equipped with a Diesel engine. Since the emission of the green house gas CO 2 is directly linked to engine efficiency, the Diesel engine is also attractive from an environmental point of view. However, despite the emission reductions achieved by improvements to the combustion process, the stringent emission legislations of the near future will be difficult to meet without exhaust gas after-treatment systems. Disadvantages of after-treatment systems are the considerable cost as well as durability and servicing issues, which is a motivation to continue studying possibilities to reduce the engine-out emissions. This thesis discusses an experimental study of some of these possibilities, including modifications to conventional Diesel combustion and Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI). An experimental high speed DI Common Rail engine was used in all of the experiments. The effects of post injection and swirl ratio on emission formation have been studied by optical diagnostics of the combustion process. Processing the obtained data with the two- colour pyrometry method provided temporally resolved soot concentration and flame temperature data, which proved to be beneficial in answering the raised questions. Adding a third, post-injection after the main injection showed significant reductions of soot emissions with only minor changes of NOx emissions and fuel consumption. The reason {{is believed to be the}} increased turbulence caused by the extra injection and to some extent the increased flame temperature during the second half of the combustion process, both of which contribute positively to the soot oxidation rate. Increasing the swirl ratio of the intake charge also showed significant reductions of soot emissions. Similar to post injection, the increased turbulence increased the soot oxidation rate late in the combustion process. HCCI combustion is known for its potential to significantly reduce NOx and soot emissions. The experiments involving HCCI combustion of conventional Diesel fuel were focussed on investigating the modifications to the engine hardware and the injection strategy that are necessary for operation in HCCI mode. A major difficulty of HCCI operation with Diesel fuel was found to be preventing over-advanced ignition and excessive combustion rates. The compression ratio was therefore reduced to delay ignition and high loads of EGR were used to further delay ignition and to reduce the combustion rate. Fuel was injected during the compression stroke in five subsequent short duration injections, so that a homogeneous mixture was created before start of combustion. Initially, compression ratios of 11. 5 and 13. 4 were used, while later in the development, the compression ratio was raised to 15. The higher compression ratio was used in combination with <b>retarded</b> intake <b>valve</b> closing timing, which reduced the effective compression ratio. Both NOx and soot emissions were reduced to near-zero levels, while the HC and CO emissions increased significantly. The increase in HC and CO emissions reduced the combustion efficiency, which was the main cause of the significant increase of fuel consumption. With the use of more accurate piezo injector and with modifications to the injection strategy, HC and CO emissions as well as fuel consumption could be reduced significantly, while maintaining low NOx and soot emission levels for most operating loads of up to 0. 5 MPa IMEP...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasingly}} prominent area {{of computer}} science is Computer Aided Geometric Design or CAGD. The main task of CAGD is to automate, {{to the greatest}} extent possible, the process of designing physical objects. A designer typically models an object {{as a collection of}} surfaces. For many objects, design specifications indicate only a few critical surfaces, with the remaining surfaces to be chosen so as to make the surface of the resulting object smooth. Smoothness is important because, in many mechanical objects, sharp edges are undesirable for functional or aesthetic reasons. For example, sharp edges on the interior surface of a gate <b>valve</b> <b>retard</b> fluid flow. Automatically calculating these remaining surfaces, called blending surfaces is an important task in any CAGD system. Therefore, an understanding of the mathematics of surfaces that meet smoothly is fundamental to CAGD. Specifically, this thesis investigates the following problem: given a surface V and a point or curve W on that surface, construct surfaces that meet with V with a specified degree of smoothness along W. Working from a measure of smoothness known as geometric continuity, {{the first half of this}} thesis establishes that the space of all surfaces meeting V with the k-th order geometric continuity along W is directly related to certain algebraic structures called ideals. For example, let Z(M) (the set of point for which a polynomial M is zero) be an irreducible surface that intersects another surface Z(N) transversally (nontangentially) in an irreducible curve Z(M) Z(N). It is shown that a surface Z(F) meets Z(M) with order k geometric continuity along Z(M) Z(N) if and only if F is a polynomial of the form AM = BN^k+ 1 where A and B are free polynomials and A is nonzero on Z(M) Z(N). The second half of this work applies these results to the problem of generating blending surfaces. Using the geometric properties of blending surfaces, it is shown that any surface Z(F) that smooths the intersection of two surfaces Z(M) and Z(N) must have certain algebraic properties. In particular, the degree of F must be greater than or equal to the maximum of the degrees of M^ 2 and N^ 2. Finally, existing methods for constructing blending surfaces are shown to be consistent within the above algebraic framework. In fact, we demonstrate that these distinct methods are instances of a single general method for generating blending surfaces. Moreover, this general method is shown to generate blending surfaces of the lowest possible degree...|$|R
