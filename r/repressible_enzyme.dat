40|$|Alkaline phosphomonoesterase (EC 3. 1. 3. 1) {{activity}} from Blastocladiella emersonii, while displaying typically broad substrate specificity for phosphorylated organic compounds, exhibited nearly complete substrate preference for N-acetylglucosamine- 6 -phosphate over N-acetylglucosamine- 1 -phosphate. Enzyme in zoospore extracts was purified 43 -fold by differential centrifugation followed by gel filtration (Sephadex G- 200) {{and then by}} ion-exchange chromatography (diethylaminoethyl-cellulose). The partially purified enzyme displayed an apparent molecular weight (Sephadex G- 200) of approximately 170, 000. The activity of partially purified enzyme exhibited a pH optimum of pH 8. 5, did not require a metal divalent cation, but was inhibitable by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. During {{the life cycle of}} the organism, the specific activity of the phosphatase decreased slightly during germination and early exponential growth but then increased about 4. 5 -fold during sporulation.

40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain H- 42 {{seems to}} have two kinds of acid phosphatase: one which is {{constitutive}} and one which is repressible by inorganic phosphate. The constitutive enzyme was significantly unstable to heat inactivation, and its Km of 9. 1 × 10 − 4 m for p-nitrophenylphosphate was {{higher than that of}} the <b>repressible</b> <b>enzyme</b> (2. 4 × 10 − 4 m). The constitutive and the repressible acid phosphatases are specified by the phoC gene and by the phoB, phoD, or phoE gene, respectively. Results of tetrad analysis suggested that the phoC and phoE genes are linked to the lys 2 locus on chromosome II. Since both repressible acid and alkaline phosphatases were affected simultaneously in the phoR, phoD, and phoS mutants, it was concluded that these enzymes were under the same regulatory mechanism or that they shared a common polypeptide. The phoR mutant produced acid phosphatase constitutively, and the phoR mutant allele was recessive to its wild-type counterpart. The phoS mutant showed a phenotype similar to that of a mutant defective in one of the phoB, phoD, or phoE genes. However, the results of genetic analysis of the phoS mutant clearly indicated that the phoS gene is not a structural gene for either of the repressible acid and alkaline phosphatases, but is a kind of regulatory gene. According to the proposed model, the phoS gene controls the expression of the phoR gene, and inorganic phosphate would act primarily as an inducer for the formation of the phoR product which represses phosphatase synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Moses, V. (University of California, Berkeley), and M. Calvin. Lifetime of {{bacterial}} messenger ribonucleic acid. J. Bacteriol. 90 : 1205 – 1217. 1965. —When cells from a stationary culture of Escherichia coli {{were placed in}} fresh medium containing inducer for β-galactosidase, growth, as represented by increase in turbidity and by total protein synthesis, started within 30 sec. By contrast, β-galactosidase synthesis was greatly delayed compared with induction during exponential growth. Two other inducible enzymes (d-serine deaminase and l-tryptophanase) and one <b>repressible</b> <b>enzyme</b> (alkaline phosphatase) showed similar lags. The lags were not due to catabolite repression. They could not be reduced by pretreatment of the culture with inducer, or by supplementing the fresh medium with amino acids or nucleotides. The lag was also demonstrated by an i− mutant constitutive for β-galactosidase synthesis. An inhibitor of ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis, 6 -azauracil, preferentially inhibited β-galactosidase synthesis compared with growth in both inducible and constitutive strains. Puromycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, acted as an inhibitor at additional sites during the induction of β-galactosidase synthesis. No inhibition of the reactions proceeding during the first 20 sec of induction was observed, but puromycin seemed to prevent the accumulation of messenger RNA during the period between 20 sec and the first appearance of enzyme activity after 3 min. It is suggested that these observations, together with many reports in the literature that inducible enzyme synthesis is more sensitive than total growth to some inhibitors and adverse growth conditions, {{can be explained by}} supposing that messenger RNA for normally inducible enzymes is biologically more labile than that for some normally constitutive proteins. The possible implications of this hypothesis for the achievement of cell differentiation by genetic regulation of enzyme synthesis are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Mutants of Escherichia coli K- 12 were {{isolated}} {{in which the}} synthesis of the following, normally <b>repressible</b> <b>enzymes</b> of aromatic biosynthesis was constitutive: 3 -deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonic acid 7 -phosphate (DAHP) synthetases (phe and tyr), chorismate mutase T-prephenate dehydrogenase, and transaminase A. In the wild type, DAHP synthetase (phe) was multivalently repressed by phenylalanine plus tryptophan, whereas DAHP synthetase (tyr), chorismate mutase T-prephenate dehydrogenase, and transaminase A were repressed by tyrosine. DAHP synthetase (tyr) and chorismate mutase T-prephenate dehydrogenase were also repressed by phenylalanine in high concentration (10 − 3 m). Besides the constitutive synthesis of DAHP synthetase (phe), the mutants had the same phenotype as strains mutated in the tyrosine regulatory gene tyrR. The mutations causing this phenotype were cotransducible with trpA, trpE, cysB, and pyrF and mapped in the same region as tyrR at approximately 26 min on the chromosome. It is concluded that these mutations may be alleles of the tyrR gene and that synthesis of the enzymes listed above is controlled by this gene. Chorismate mutase P and prephenate dehydratase activities which are carried on a single protein were repressed by phenylalanine alone and were not controlled by tyrR. Formation of this protein is presumed {{to be controlled by}} a separate, unknown regulator gene. The heat-stable phenylalanine transaminase and two enzymes of the common aromatic pathway, 5 -dehydroquinate synthetase and 5 -dehydroquinase, were not repressible under the conditions studied and were not affected by tyrR. DAHP synthetase (trp) and tryptophan synthetase were repressed by tryptophan and have previously been shown to be {{under the control of the}} trpR regulatory gene. These enzymes also were unaffected by tyrR...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{selectable}} strain {{variations in}} the development of pathogen strategies was examined using lines of Metarhizium anisopliae isolated from homopteran (isolate 549) or coleopteran (isolate 808) hosts. Conidia of strain 549 germinated in either alanine, glucose, cyclic AMP or the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3 -isobutyl-l-methylxanthine(IBMX). Thenon-metabolizableglucose analogues, 3 -O-methylglucose and 6 -deoxyglucose, did not allow germination by themselves but stimulated germination when added to IBMX. By contrast, 2 -deoxyglucose (dGlc) blocked germination on glucose or IBMX and inhibited hyphal growth on other carbon sources including alanine and glycerol. Conidia of strain 808 germinated rapidly in alanine but responded slowly to glucose or IBMX in the medium and were resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of dGlc. Radioactive dGlc was taken up by conidia of strains 549 and 808 at similar rates and was recovered mainly as 2 -deoxyglucose 6 -phosphate. Competition experiments utilizing both strains demonstrated that glucose, dGlc and 3 - 0 -methylglucose were transported by the same system. Fructose was much less able than glucose to inhibit uptake of dGlc indicating that fructose is taken up by a different transport system than that for glucose. It is unlikely, therefore, that the resistance of strain 808 to dGlc is explained by reduced sugar transport compared with strain 549 but that strains 549 and 808 differ in the regulation of carbon metabolism with some systems in strain 808 showing resistance to the catabolite-repressing effects of glucose. Apparently, catabolite repression is subdivided into different segments as glucose inhibited the derepression of a number of catabolite <b>repressible</b> <b>enzymes</b> in strain 808, including the pathogenicity determinant protease Prl. The same effectwasproducedbydGlcbutnotby 3 -O-methylglucose, indicatingthatthe trigger for catabolite repression occurs at the level of transport-associated glucose phosphorylation. A comparative study of 26 isolates indicatedthat most lines from coleopteran hosts were dGlc resistant and germinated poorly on glucose. Conversely, isolates germinating well on glucose (mostly from hemipteran and lepidopteran hosts) were dGlc susceptible...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of maltase, an inducible and <b>repressible</b> catabolic <b>enzyme</b> in Saccharomyces italicus, was studied and compared in batch, fed-batch, and continuous fermentations. Tight genetic controls on maltase synthesis limited {{the effect of}} environmental manipulations such as fed-batch or continuous culture in enhancement of maltase synthesis, and neither approach was able to improve the performance above the batch process for maltase production. S. italicus was mutated, and a constitutive producer of maltase was isolated. The mutant was detected by its ability to grow on sucrose, which is a noninducing substrate that is hydrolyzed by maltase; S. italicus does not possess invertase and will not normally grow on sucrose. Maltase production by this mutant was studied during growth on sucrose in batch and continuous cultures and marked improvement in enzyme productivity was observed. The specific activity of maltase produced by this mutant was {{more than twice that}} of the parent wild type: 2, 210 and 1, 370 U/g of cells for the mutant versus 890 and 510 U/g of cells for the wild type in batch and continuous cultures, respectively. Maltase specific productivity was increased from 74 to 288 U/g of cells per h by switching from batch growth of the wild type to continuous cultivation of the mutant...|$|R
40|$|Methionine {{biosynthesis}} {{and regulation}} of four enzymatic steps {{involved in this}} pathway were studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in relation to genes concerned with resistance to ethionine (eth 1 and eth 2). Data {{presented in this paper}} and others favor a scheme which excludes cystathionine as an obligatory intermediate. Kinetic data are presented for homocysteine synthetase [Km(O-acetyl-l-homoserine) = 7 × 10 − 3 m; Ki (l-methionine) = 1. 9 × 10 − 3 m]. Enzymes catalyzing steps 3, 4, 5, and 9 were <b>repressible</b> by methionine. <b>Enzyme</b> 4 (homoserine-O-transacetylase) and enzyme 9 (homocysteine synthetase) were simultaneously derepressed in strains carrying the mutant allele eth 2 r. Studies on diploid strains confirmed the dominance of the eth 2 s allele over eth 2 r. Regulation of enzyme 3 (homoserine dehydrogenase) and enzyme 5 (adenosine triphosphate sulfurylase) is not modified by the allele eth 2 r. The other gene eth 1 did not appear to participate in regulation of these four steps. Gene enzyme relationship was determined for three of the four steps studied (steps 3, 4, and 9). The structural genes concerned with the steps which are under the control of eth 2 (met 8 : enzyme 9 and meta: enzyme 4) segregate independently, and are unlinked to eth 2. These results are compatible with the idea that the gene eth 2 is responsible for the synthesis of a pleiotropic methionine repressor and suggest the existence of at least two different methionine repressors in S. cerevisiae. Implications of these findings in general regulatory mechanisms have been discussed...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIA {{continuous}} {{model of a}} metabolic network including gene regulation to simulate metabolic fluxes during batch cultivation of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was developed. The metabolic network includes reactions of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glycerol and ethanol synthesis and consumption, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and protein synthesis. Carbon sources considered were glucose and then ethanol synthesized during growth on glucose. The metabolic network has 39 fluxes, which represent the action of 50 enzymes and 64 genes and it is coupled with a gene regulation network which defines enzyme synthesis (activities) and incorporates regulation by glucose (enzyme induction and repression), modeled using ordinary differential equations. The model includes enzyme kinetics, equations that follow both mass-action law and transport as well as inducible, <b>repressible,</b> and constitutive <b>enzymes</b> of metabolism. The model was able to simulate a fermentation of S. cerevisiae during the exponential growth phase on glucose and the exponential growth phase on ethanol using only one set of kinetic parameters. All fluxes in the {{continuous model}} followed the behavior shown by the metabolic flux analysis (MFA) obtained from experimental results. The differences obtained between the fluxes given by the model and the fluxes determined by the MFA do not exceed 25 % in 75 % of the cases during exponential growth on glucose, and 20 % in 90 % of the cases during exponential growth on ethanol. Furthermore, the adjustment of the fermentation profiles of biomass, glucose, and ethanol were 95 %, 95 %, and 79 %, respectively. With these results the simulation was considered successful. A comparison between the simulation of the continuous model and the experimental data of the diauxic yeast fermentation for glucose, biomass, and ethanol, shows an extremely good match using the parameters found. The small discrepancies between the fluxes obtained through MFA and those predicted by the differential equations, {{as well as the}} good match between the profiles of glucose, biomass, and ethanol, and our simulation, show that this simple model, that does not rely on complex kinetic expressions, is able to capture the global behavior of the experimental data. Also, the determination of parameters using a straightforward minimization technique using data at only two points in time was sufficient to produce a relatively accurate model. Thus, even {{with a small amount of}} experimental data (rates and not concentrations) it was possible to estimate the parameters minimizing a simple objective function. The method proposed allows the obtention of reasonable parameters and concentrations in a system with a much larger number of unknowns than equations. Hence a contribution of this study is to present a convenient way to find in vivo rate parameters to model metabolic and genetic networks under different conditions...|$|R
