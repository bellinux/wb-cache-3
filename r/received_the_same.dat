In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 rounds, and contributed a platoon whose job would be to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack. A small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} most Maunsell designs, the Q class {{locomotives}} were reliable, {{but there were}} complaints of poor steaming when used on main-line trains (for which they were never designed).

This proved to be successful and the remainder of the class were so fitted between 1946 and 1949. During the 1950s further experiments were carried out by the fitting of a British Railways Standard Class 4 plain blast pipe and small stovepipe chimney to no. 30549 in 1955, resulting in further improvements in both steaming and fuel consumption; in 1958–61, six more <b>received</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> blast pipe with a BR Standard Class 4 chimney.|$|E
