5|$|Canadian {{citizenship}} is typically obtained by birth in Canada or by birth or adoption abroad when {{at least one}} biological parent or adoptive parent is a Canadian citizen {{who was born in}} Canada or naturalized in Canada (and did not receive citizenship by being born outside of Canada to a Canadian citizen). It can also be granted to a permanent resident who lives in Canada for three out of four years and meets specific requirements. Canada established its own nationality law in 1946, with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act which took effect on January 1, 1947. The Immigration and <b>Refugee</b> <b>Protection</b> Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 2001 as Bill C-11, which replaced the Immigration Act of 1976 as the primary federal legislation regulating immigration. Prior to the conferring of legal status on Canadian citizenship, Canada's naturalization laws consisted of a multitude of Acts beginning with the Immigration Act of 1910.|$|E

40|$|Article 1 D of the 1951 Refugee Convention singles out {{individuals}} who receive aid from UN agencies, and specifically applies to Palestinian refugees receiving {{aid from the}} UN Refugee and Works Agency (UNRWA). While Article 1 D was first introduced to afford Palestinian <b>refugees</b> heightened <b>protection,</b> national courts have often interpreted this clause to leave Palestinian <b>refugees</b> without <b>protection.</b> More than 60 years after the initial refugee crisis, how does this provision affect displaced Palestinians today? This paper shows that the haphazard interpretation of Article 1 D has often left Palestinian <b>refugees</b> without <b>protection</b> and that this lack of protection has been exacerbated for Palestinians fleeing the crisis in Syria. One solution would be to enable the UNHCR to take {{on some of the}} protective functions that used to be provided by the now-defunct UN Conciliation Commission for Palestine...|$|R

The 2009 {{version of the bill}} (Bill C-45: An Act to amend the Immigration and <b>Refugee</b> <b>Protection</b> Act) contained provisions intended to tighten the issuing of visas to exotic dancers, to combat human trafficking. In August 2009, the city of Rio de Janeiro, while bidding for the 2014 World Cup, shut down one of its most notorious clubs, the Help discoth√®que. There were plans to bulldoze the club and [...] "replace it with a music-themed museum" [...] with US firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro as architects, backed by Rio's governor Sergio Cabral who was also backing the 2016 Summer Olympics bid. In November 2009, officials in Rio de Janeiro threatened to sue American comedian Robin Williams for disparaging comments made on a late-night talk show. One of his comments on its Olympics bid, [...] "Rio sent 50 strippers and a pound of blow. It wasn't really fair, you know?" [...] was replayed several times on news shows in Brazil and prompted a public response from its mayor. The Olympic Committee for Rio had its lawyers investigate whether there were grounds for a lawsuit, but no charges were filed.|$|E
2500|$|Australia is a {{party to}} the 1951 Refugee Convention, which obliges member states to offer {{protection}} to those seeking asylum due to a well-founded fear of persecution in their home countries due to, among other things, their membership of a particular social group. Australia first recognised [...] "sexual preference" [...] as a [...] "social group" [...] for the purposes of <b>refugee</b> <b>protection</b> in 1992 in Morato's Case. In 2003 a majority of the High Court of Australia held that Australia should not withhold asylum from gay refugees on the basis that they could protect themselves in their home countries by hiding their sexuality. The decision making process for assessing LGBT asylum claims lacks consistency and relies on stereotypes such as whether the person attended gay clubs or joined lesbian groups.|$|E
2500|$|A Border Services Officer (BSO) is {{a federal}} law {{enforcement}} officer employed by the Canada Border Services Agency. While Border Services Officer is the overarching term for the CBSA's front-line personnel, it is actually not a title derived from legislation. Rather BSOs receive multiple legislative designations such as Customs Officers under the [...] "Customs Act", Immigration Officers under the Immigration and <b>Refugee</b> <b>Protection</b> Act, and Screening Officers under the [...] "Quarantine Act". Border Services Officers are, when enforcing customs- or immigration-related legislation, Peace Officers under the Criminal Code of Canada; however, they can only make arrests for offences under the Code if they are appointed [...] "designated officers" [...] by the Minister of Public Safety under Section 163.4 of the [...] "Customs Act" [...] and are at customs office performing the normal duties of an officer. Border Services Officers are equipped with handcuffs, oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray, batons, and are currently armed with Beretta PX4 Storm pistols. The arming initiative began in 2007 and officially concluded in 2016.|$|E
5000|$|Palestinian {{refugees}} {{were excluded from}} the 1951 Convention due to the clause that [...] "This Convention shall not apply to persons who are at present receiving from organs or agencies of the United Nations other than the United Nations High Commissioner for <b>Refugees</b> <b>protection</b> or assistance." [...] As interpreted by UNHCR, this caused some anomalies, since UNRWA admits some persons as refugees that are not automatically admitted by the Convention, and, conversely, some of the legal <b>protections</b> given to <b>refugees</b> by the Convention were not available to most Palestinians. In 2002, UNHCR adopted a revised interpretation that fills some of these gaps. The BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights published a critical analysis of UNHCR revised interpretation of the 1951 Refugee Convention.|$|R
40|$|About 6, 000 refugees, {{asylum seekers}} and torture claimants (collectively ‚Äúprotection claimants‚Äù) are {{struggling}} to survive in Hong Kong. It is undoubted that they are an underprivileged and marginalized group in Hong Kong. Since Hong Kong is not the signatory of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of <b>Refugees,</b> <b>protection</b> claimants do not enjoy legal status or formal rights to welfare services in Hong Kong. Without the right to work, protection claimants must survive on $ 1, 500 a month for accommodation and bags of food equivalent to $ 1, 200, or they may risk to work illegally in Hong Kong. This thesis examines how Hong Kong refugee policy affects the life of protection claimants in terms of right to work, food assistance and accommodation allowance. These factors are of paramount importance {{to the life of}} protection claimants. Drawing on qualitative participant-observations and in-depth interviews with protection claimants, it demonstrates the primary and secondary consequences that caused by the current refugee policy. Additionally, this thesis discovers how protection claimants react to the policy, revealing that the Hong Kong current <b>refugee</b> policy puts <b>protection</b> claimants into dilemma...|$|R

2500|$|In March 2008 {{as part of}} {{the annual}} budget, the {{government}} introduced several laws to amend the Immigration and <b>Refugee</b> <b>Protection</b> Act. The changes would have helped to streamline immigrant application back-up, to speed up application for skilled workers and to rapidly reject other ones that are judged not admissible by immigration officers. Immigrant applications had risen to a high of 500,000, creating a delay of up to six months for an application to be processed. The bill also provided more power to the Minister to set limits on the types of immigrants that can have their application processed. The government added that the reforms would have provided more skilled workers to the [...] country. [...] The opposition members criticized the measures because it would shut the door on immigrants while giving the Minister too much power to decide on who can enter Canada and others not. Trinity‚ÄîSpadina MP Olivia Chow had proposed an amendment to remove the measures {{as part of the}} budget. Immigration Minister Diane Finley stated that the current government helped process applications 20 to 40 percent faster than [...] before the measures were announced.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 prime {{minister}} Kevin Rudd {{introduced a new}} asylum policy which meant that all asylum seekers arriving by boat would be sent offshore to Manus Island in Papua New Guinea for processing and resettlement. This included gay refugees, even though they face persecution under Papua New Guinean law with homosexual acts criminalised and a potential penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Asylum seekers are warned in an orientation presentation on arrival by the Salvation Army that [...] "Homosexuality is illegal in Papua New Guinea. People have been imprisoned or killed for performing homosexual acts." [...] This places them {{in the position of}} being required to declare their sexuality to be eligible for <b>refugee</b> <b>protection</b> yet liable to face persecution from other people and under local laws. Gay asylum seekers also face bullying, assault and sexual abuse on Manus Island from others, including officials and other refugees, due to their sexuality. Australia faces accusations from refugee advocates that it has violated its non-refoulement obligations under international law by exposing LGBT asylum seekers to such dangers.

40|$|States {{have been}} {{granting}} protection {{to individuals and}} groups fleeing persecution for centuries; however, the modern refugee regime is largely {{the product of the}} second half of the twentieth century. Like international human rights law, modern refugee law has its origins in the aftermath of World War II as well as the refugee crises of the interwar years that preceded it. The refugee in international law occupies a large space characterized, on the one hand, by the principle of State sovereignty and, on the other hand, by competing humanitarian principles deriving from general international law and from treaty. The study of <b>refugee</b> <b>protections</b> invites a look not only at States‚Äô obligations with regard to admission and treatment after entry, but also at the potential responsibility in international law of the State whose conduct or omissions cause an outflow. The community of nations is responsible in a general sense for finding solutions and in providing international <b>protection</b> to <b>refugee.</b> This special mandate was entrusted to UNHCR. At the start of the 21 st century, protecting refugees means maintaining solidarity with the world‚Äôs most threatened, while finding answers to the challenges confronting the international system that was created to do just that. The aim of this article is to describe the foundations and the framework of international refugee law, to define <b>refugees</b> and <b>protection</b> of refugees; as well as to provides a brief analysis of the changing migration and asylum dynamics in the region and outlines some of the main challenges arising in this context. ...|$|R
