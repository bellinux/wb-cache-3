40|$|In view of {{the many}} {{discordant}} findings in previous studies regarding the genetics of prelingual deafness, family data (133 nuclear families and 25 pedigrees) were gathered from India. Analysis of these data has revealed that the defect is primarily genetic, which is in agreement with earlier findings. Segregation analysis was performed to compare various autosomal diallelic one-locus and multilocus models. Our analysis revealed that the most parsimonious model for prelingual deafness {{is that it is}} controlled by recessive genes at a pair of unlinked diallelic autosomal loci. Individuals are affected if and only if they are recessive homozygous at both loci. The likelihood of the present data under this two-locus multiple <b>recessive</b> <b>homozygosis</b> model is at least 10 (8) times higher than that of the one-locus models that were examined in previous studies. This model is also the best-fitting model among other plausible two-locus models...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the association between metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) with the presence of VDR 2228570 C[*]>[*]T and VDR 1544410 A[*]>[*]G polymorphisms in Brazilian adults. 				 				 					 						Methods 					Two hundred forty three (243) individuals were included in a cross-sectional study. MetSyn was classified using the criteria proposed by National Cholesterol Educational Program - Adult Treatment Panel III. Insulin resistance and β cell secretion were estimated by the mathematical models of HOMA IR and β, respectively.

Results 					Individuals with MetSyn and heterozygosis for VDR 2228570 C[*]>[*]T have higher concentrations of iPTH and HOMA β than those without this polymorphism, and subjects with <b>recessive</b> <b>homozygosis</b> for the same polymorphisms presented higher insulin resistance than those with the heterozygous genotype.

A significant lower concentration of 25 (OH) D 3 was observed only in individuals without MetSyn in the VDR 1544410 A[*]>[*]G genotype.

Conclusions 					Using two common VDR polymorphism data suggests they may influence insulin secretion, insulin resistance an serum HDL-cholesterol in our highly heterogeneous population.

40|$|The long {{juvenile}} period (LJP) characteristic of soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) cultivars delays flowering under short-day conditions. This trait {{may be important}} in increasing the adaptation range of soybean to low latitudes and provides greater flexibility for sowing times within the same latitude. The inheritance of the long {{juvenile period}} was studied in the MG/BR 22 (Garimpo) soybean cultivar to provide knowledge to support the development of cultivars adapted to short day conditions. Four cultivars (?Paraná?, ?Bossier?, ?Bragg?, and ?Davis?) were crossed among {{each other and with}} MG/BR 22 (?Garimpo?). The study was conducted under short-day conditions (early sowing) in a greenhouse and in the field, in Londrina, Paraná, (23 degrees 22 ? south latitude). The parents and the F 1, F 2, and F 3 populations were assessed daily for flowering. The genotype ratios of 15 : 1 (p > 0. 95, chi² test) and 8 : 7 : 1 (p = 0. 193) for the F 2 and F 3 generations, respectively, obtained for the Paraná x Bossier cross indicated a case of digenic interaction with a duplicate recessive epistatic effect for the LJP character. Segregation of the F 2 population from the MG/BR 22 (Garimpo) x Paraná cross resulted in the expected ratio of 3 : 1 (p = 0. 166, indicating that the MG/BR 22 (Garimpo) and Paraná cultivars differed at a single locus. Similarly, in the MG/BR 22 (Garimpo) x Bossier cross, a 3 : 1 (p = 0. 065) segregation indicated that these two cultivars differed at a single locus for number of days to flowering. The Davis cultivar had the same gene for LJP as the Paraná cultivar (aa). The F 2 segregation of the classic flowering Bragg with MG/BR 22 (Garimpo) cross resulted in a 15 : 1 (p = 0. 138) ratio, indicating that these two cultivars differed at two loci for flowering. The genotypes assigned to the cultivars were aaBB for Paraná, AAbb for Bossier and aabb for MG/BR 22 (Garimpo). A single locus in <b>recessive</b> <b>homozygosis</b> does not produce LJP...|$|E
