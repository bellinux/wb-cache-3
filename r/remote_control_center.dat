40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{monitoring}} and control of tap changer mechanism of a transformer implementation in an Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) is discussed. It has been a custom for decades to provide a separate panel for {{on load tap changer}} control for monitoring the tap position. However, this facility cannot either record or transfer the information to <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>centers.</b> As there is a technology shift towards the smart grid protection and control standards, the need for implementing <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> and monitoring has necessitated the implementation of this feature in numerical relays. This paper deals with the programming, settings and logic implementation which is applicable to both IEC 61850 compatible and non-compatible IEDs thereby eliminating the need for separate tap changer control equipment. The monitoring mechanism has been implemented in a 28 MVA, 110 / 6. 9 kV transformer with 16 tap position with GE make T 60 IED at Ultratech cement limited Gulbarga, Karnataka and is in successful service.

These flight operations currently take place in segregated airspace to ensure the safety of the air vehicle and other airspace users. Some administrations expect deployment of UASs throughout the airspace structure, i. e. within both segregated and non-segregated airspace. As UAS deployment increases, it will be impractical for some users to deploy in segregated airspace. Some UASs will need to integrate with the current non-segregated airspace users in a safe and seamless manner. To accomplish integration into non-segregated airspace, UASs will require high integrity communication links between the unmanned aircraft (UA) and <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>centers</b> capable of relaying the necessary air traffic control (ATC) messages and flight critical aircraft information.

The use of RTUs at strategic locations in the transmission system for monitoring system parameters limits the complete observability of the system providing partial information about the system. This paper discusses an algorithm to detect line outages in the transmission system using the bus voltage phasor measurement available from PMUs in conjunction with change in the system topology arising due to line outage. The algorithm also suggests the minimum number of PMUs required for effective line outage detection for a given system. The system under consideration was simulated in MiPowerTM software to obtain the bus voltage angle and the algorithm to detect effective line outage was programmed using MATLAB. Initially, PMUs were assumed to be placed at all buses in the system to detect line outage and {{the efficacy of the}} algorithm was checked and proved. The number of PMUs in the system was then reduced by removing them from the buses with least priority, based on their generation capacity and amount of real power consumed by connected load, to arrive at the minimum number of PMUs. The technique was successfully implemented on IEEE 14 -bus and IEEE 30 -bus system. The minimum number of PMUs required for effective line outage detection was determined successfully in both the systems...|$|R

An online intelligent alarm-processing system is developed based on {{the architecture of the}} digital substation. First, real-time alarms are classified according to the IEC 61850 standard in order to provide synthesized and organized alarms for the alarm-processing procedure in the next step. Then, a new and systematic alarm-processing approach for digital substations is developed. Two modules (i. e., the generation of candidate hypotheses and the truth evaluation for the hypotheses) are in-cluded in the developed approach, and these two modules are operating in parallel in online implementation. This approach could not only determine the fault/disturbance cause but also the missing or false alarms as well as the causes of the false alarms. According to actual application requirements, an online intelligent alarm-processing system is developed and applied in the Xingguo substation—the first digital substation in Jiangxi Province, China. Finally, an actual alarm-processing scenario serves to demonstrate the presented alarm-processing method as well as the developed software system.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{an important}} class of sensor networks where {{the ultimate goal}} is not necessarily to collect each individual measurement but rather a potentially smaller set of statistics. Considering link capacity constrained topologies, we derive results that optimally allocate rate/distortion to information collected by the sensors. As a key contribution, we determine how the flow of information emanating from the sensors should be managed, yielding optimal routing algorithms and jointly optimized networks. Our analysis encompasses the typical scenarios that are widely observed in sensor networks, and over these scenarios, we quantify the gains offered by sending the statistics rather than the measurement data itself. Our results reveal bottleneck situations over various scenarios, where directly performing bandwidth allocation over the statistics does not provide the desired gains. We start the analysis from a simple scenario, where a fixed node aggregates all the information in the sensor network and relays the information to a <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>center.</b> We obtain close form expressions and illustrate how allocating bandwidth for each individual measurement (Case- 1) performs compared to allocating it for each desired statistic (Case- 2) in different bottleneck situations. Then, we extend this scenario to the case where we optimally select a number of aggregators from a cloud of sensor nodes. In this second scenario, under well defined bandwidth constraints, we look at the optimum clustering problem, in which the goal is to select the best aggregation nodes to minimize the total distortion of the desired statistics at the remote control node. We provide an algorithmic solution that returns the optimum aggregation points and the optimum size of each cluster under some mild assumptions. We finally turn our attention to the general routing problem and provide an algorithm that performs routing and bandwidth allocation jointly. We also study the performance and behavior of bandwidth allocation for both Case- 1 and Case- 2. 1...|$|E
