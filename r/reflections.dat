The study applies Hatton and Smith’s (1995) types of writing: descriptive writing, descriptive <b>reflection,</b> dialogic <b>reflection,</b> and critical <b>reflection.</b> Case study and content analysis methodologies are simultaneously used to address the research questions. This study reveals that interns engage in written <b>reflection</b> within all three categories (descriptive <b>reflection,</b> dialogic <b>reflection,</b> and critical <b>reflection)</b> (Dinkelman, 2000; Hatton & Smith, 1995), however, the overwhelming majority of <b>reflection</b> is descriptive <b>reflection</b> (95. 8 %), followed by dialogic <b>reflection</b> (4. 1 %) and critical <b>reflection</b> (0. 1 %). This study did not find a single condition, topic, or assignment that guarantees written dialogic or critical <b>reflection.</b> Instead, this study found that intern written dialogic and critical <b>reflection</b> appears to be an outgrowth of a combination of factors including, but not limited to, intern understanding of <b>reflection,</b> internship semester responsibilities, assignment design, {{and the role of the}} college supervisor...|$|R

5|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Men, in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke; Occasioned by His <b>Reflections</b> on the Revolution in France (1790) is a {{political}} pamphlet, written by the 18th-century British liberal feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, which attacks aristocracy and advocates republicanism. Wollstonecraft's was the first response in a pamphlet war sparked by the publication of Edmund Burke's <b>Reflections</b> on the Revolution in France (1790), a defense of constitutional monarchy, aristocracy, and the Church of England.|$|E
5|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman {{was written}} against the tumultuous {{background}} of the French Revolution and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now {{referred to as the}} Revolution controversy, British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to {{the separation of church and}} state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a response to Edmund Burke's <b>Reflections</b> on the Revolution in France (1790). In his <b>Reflections,</b> Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own Glorious Revolution in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642–1651) in which Charles I had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In <b>Reflections</b> he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged—the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men, published just six weeks after Burke's <b>Reflections,</b> is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.|$|E

5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant <b>reflections,</b> and <b>reflections</b> meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E

40|$|This {{hermeneutic}} phenomenological inquiry {{centered on}} the broad questions: how do practising nurses experience <b>reflection?</b> Where, when, and how does <b>reflection</b> enter the experience of practising nurses? Seven long-term care nurses, a culturally cohesive sample, each participated in two audiotaped conversational interviews. Through these conversations, I gathered and explored experiential narrative material. A focus group with long-term care nurses from a different region enabled expansion, clarification and verification of the data. Descriptions and patterns emerged from the texts/data and I linked them to <b>reflection</b> dimensions and four fundamental lifeworld themes. Images of watching a movie, puzzling through, and putting the pieces together, capture the complexity of <b>reflection.</b> Three constructions illuminate the nurses' experience of reflection: <b>reflection</b> and the geography of everyday life; <b>reflection</b> in the between; and <b>reflection</b> is relation. These original and innovative understandings address an absence of practising nurses' experiences in the extant literature and contribute to scholarly knowledge. Implications for practice include accepting the challenge from the College of Nurses, reflective inquiry culture and <b>reflection</b> for practice. <b>Reflection</b> is in two modes, annual and everyday. A culture of reflective inquiry frames practice. The nurses act knowledge in practice. There is a curious absence of <b>reflection</b> in action/practice, and an environment unsympathetic to <b>reflection</b> and reflective practice. <b>Reflection</b> in the geography of everyday life is a remarkable contrast to the almost reified conceptions of or formulae for <b>reflection.</b> The language of the everyday characterizes these nurses' experience of <b>reflection.</b> <b>Reflection</b> terminology has infiltrated practice, but it is unclear if practice has changed. Does <b>reflection</b> contribute to improvement in nursing practice and patient outcomes? The intersubjective nature of nursing and <b>reflection</b> {{is so strong that}} relationships, rather than individual functioning, might become the primary unit for <b>reflection</b> reflecting. In the geography of everyday life, <b>reflection</b> moves from the mountain tops to the everyday. This creates the potential to develop a new and potentially different <b>reflection</b> discourse. This construction provides a direction for developing new ways of speaking in and about practice...|$|R

40|$|In this article, a {{contribution}} {{is made to}} the discussion of <b>reflection</b> {{on the part of}} teachers. The discussion to date has shown that <b>reflection</b> must be broad and deep. However, just what constitutes broad and deep <b>reflection</b> and the relations between the two remain unclear. After consideration of the characteristics of broad and deep <b>reflection,</b> three domains of broad <b>reflection</b> are distinguished (i. e. the pragmatic, ethical and moral domains). Closed versus open approaches to deep <b>reflection</b> are also then distinguished which produces a typology of six <b>reflection</b> possibilities. Empirical support for this typology was gathered via interviews with 11 experienced secondary school teachers. The content of the interviews addressed actual difficult decision situations which the teachers had experienced, and application of the constant comparative method showed the teachers to indeed use the six <b>reflection</b> possibilities when they reflected upon the difficult decision situations. A clear preference for closed types of pragmatic and ethical <b>reflection</b> over open or moral <b>reflection</b> was shown. The conclusion is that the proposed typology can be used to map teacher <b>reflection.</b> The results further suggest that the breadth and depth of teacher <b>reflection</b> are in need of development and that the relations between teacher <b>reflection</b> and their professional behaviour should be examined in greater detail...|$|R
