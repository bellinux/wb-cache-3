This game {{marked the first}} postseason appearance of Pedro Martínez against the Yankees since the 2004 American League Championship Series, {{when he was with}} the Boston Red Sox and a part of the two teams' long standing rivalry; it was also the second-ever World Series start that Martínez made. There was much media interest in Martínez's [...] "return to Yankee Stadium" [...] for Game 2, as he told reporters at a pre-game press conference [...] "When you have 60,000 people chanting your name, waiting for you to throw the ball, you have to consider yourself someone special, someone that <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> purpose out there." ...|$|E
500|$|The book chronicles Taibbi's {{changing}} assessment's of Trump's likelihood {{to actually}} win the 2016 election for president. In August 2015, he criticizes the poor slate {{of candidates for}} the Republican nomination for president, calling them the [...] "GOP clown car". Taibbi begins to change his views after personally visiting speeches by Trump at campaign stops in the beginning portion of 2016. In an election dispatch from September 2016, Taibbi writes, [...] "I still don’t think Trump <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> chance, but we’re sure headed towards a scary ending." [...] In October, he states, [...] "Trump can’t win. Our national experiment can’t end because one ageing narcissist got bored of sex and food. Not even America deserves that." [...] The book castigates Republican tactics of engaging in culture wars, writing they are, [...] "taking {{advantage of the fact}} that their voters didn’t know the difference between an elitist and the actual elite, between a snob and an oligarch." [...] Taibbi documents how Trump's inflammatory campaign rhetoric, often over social media including Twitter, garnered him increased publicity which led to increased influence.|$|E
500|$|Sire Records had marketed the [...] "Everybody" [...] single as if Madonna {{was a black}} artist. This {{misconception}} {{was cleared}} by {{the release of the}} music video for the song. Regarding the importance of shooting a music video for the song, Madonna commented that, [...] "If I didn't have a video, I don't think all the kids in the Midwest would know about me. It takes the place of touring. Everybody sees them everywhere. That <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{lot to do with the}} success of my album." [...] She invited Sire Records executives, including Stein and Rosenblatt, to the New York nightclub Danceteria. She performed [...] "Everybody" [...] on the dancefloor, wearing a top hat and tails. On the night of the performance, Madonna's friend Haoui Montaug introduced her to the 300 strong audience. Cheered by them, Madonna and her dancers performed their choreographed dance moves, later described as a 'disco act backed by avant-garde dancers.' Seeing the performance, they also realised that Madonna appeared visually stunning. They ordered an in-house video of [...] "Everybody" [...] to be sent to the clubs around the country which used dance videos.|$|E

2500|$|Semi-open headphones, have {{a design}} that can be {{considered}} as a compromise between open-back headphones and closed-back headphones. Some believe the term [...] "semi-open" [...] is purely there for marketing purposes. There is no exact definition for the term semi-open headphone. Where the open-back approach has hardly any measure to block sound at the outer side of the diaphragm and the closed-back approach <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> closed chamber at the outer side of the diaphragm, a semi-open headphone can have a chamber to partially block sound while letting some sound through via openings or vents.|$|E
2500|$|Intense media {{interest}} preceded Martínez's [...] "return to Yankee Stadium" [...] in Game 2 of the World Series. At the pre-game press conference, {{he seemed}} to relish the attention, telling reporters, [...] "When you have 60,000 people chanting your name, {{waiting for you to}} throw the ball, you have to consider yourself someone special, someone that <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> purpose out there." [...] Martínez pitched effectively in his second-ever World Series start, but left the game in the 7th inning trailing, 2–1, and wound up taking the loss. Before his second start of the Series, Martínez called himself and opposing pitcher Andy Pettitte [...] "old goats", and acknowledged that Red Sox fans were rooting for him: [...] "I know that they don't like the Yankees to win, not even in Nintendo games." [...] However, Martínez allowed 4 runs in 4 innings, falling to 0–2 as the Phillies lost the sixth game and the 2009 World Series to the New York Yankees.|$|E
2500|$|Shnitzel (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson in [...] "The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin", and John DiMaggio afterward): A taupe rock monster and {{professional}} chef {{who works at}} Mung Daal's Catering Company. His vocabulary consists almost entirely of [...] "radda", while it's translated as [...] "okay", although he sometimes says other simple words. He talks in the episode [...] "The Trouble with Truffles" [...] because he finally gets calm enough. Shnitzel is the [...] "straight man" [...] to the other more excitable characters and is frequently agitated. He gets stuck with menial labor or cleanup duty, {{as well as the}} heavy lifting because he is extremely strong. Although usually angered by Chowder's antics, Shnitzel <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> soft spot for Chowder, as he cries when it was thought that Chowder has vanished forever. Kevin Michael Richardson voiced Shnitzel for the debut episode [...] "The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin" [...] and was replaced at the last moment by DiMaggio due to Richardson being busy with other projects at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Bleu {{moved with}} his family from New York to Los Angeles in 1996. He worked {{steadily}} in episodic television and feature film roles, including a recurring role on the short-lived ABC police drama High Incident and a guest star appearance on ER. He also appeared in some films Beach Movie (1998), the sci-fi thriller Soldier (1998). His feature films from this period include the Tim Allen comedy Galaxy Quest (1999), and the comedy Mystery Men (1999), which starred Ben Stiller, and the drama Family Tree (1999). Bleu also had roles in Malcolm & Eddie, as Matthew, and [...] (2000), as Nick Elderby. He also had small role in television series like [...] The Amanda Show. Additionally, Bleu was developing his dance skills and in 2001 began intensive training at the Debbie Allen Dance Academy in the Los Angeles area. There he undertook a full gamut of dance instruction, including ballet, jazz, tap, modern, hip-hop, African, break dance, salsa, flamenco, and ballroom. Allen, the famous choreographer who starred in the TV series Fame, told Dance Spirit magazine, [...] "I think [...] <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> career.
