5|$|Vehicles also {{received}} digital enhancement. For {{the scene in}} which the Expendables crash their Canadair CL-215 amphibious plane into a cave, the effects team intended to use Miniature effects, filming using a 1/3 scale model of the 90-feet wing span plane. Production constraints and the limited shooting schedule meant the miniature shoot was abandoned and the entire sequence was rendered digitally. The plane itself was also digitally modified, adding a nose mounted gun which in practice could have stalled the engine with its recoil. A <b>rear</b> <b>hatch</b> door was required for jet skis to drive into the plane but the crafts design made such a door impractical; visual trickery was used to obscure this fact and make the door fit into the existing plane design. A helicopter used in the opening sequence was required to perform more dynamic moves {{and so it was}} digitally removed entirely and replaced with a digital recreation that better fit the scene's requirements. The helicopter which decapitates Hector during his fight with Christmas had no rotors and they were digitally added. WWFX later enhanced it more, modifying lighting and stabilizing the helicopter's body which shook unnaturally when struck during the fight. The Sangs Mi-8 helicopter was a civilian variant, but it was digitally replaced with the gunship variant, the Hip-E, to make it look meaner and more fitting for Van Damme's villainous mercenary, with a black reflective coating and armaments. The T-72 tank used to assault the Expendables would have devastated the set with the resulting concussive wave if it had fired a single shot, so it was replaced in most shots with a digital version that performed the shooting.|$|E

25|$|In 1982 Chevrolet {{knew this}} would be the last year of an entire {{generation}} of Corvettes and so commemorated the occasion by offering a Collector Edition with separate serial number sequencing, silver-beige paint, unique wheels patterned after the 1967 model's bolt-on alloys, and an operable <b>rear</b> <b>hatch</b> window.|$|E
25|$|Toyota {{expected}} the Prius Prime {{to achieve an}} EPA rating of , a 26% enhancement over the first generation model. Toyota targeted the fuel economy in hybrid mode to be equal or better than regular fourth generation Prius liftback. To reduce weight, Toyota used aluminum for the hood, and high-tensile strength steel. The Prius Prime features Toyota’s first carbon fiber <b>rear</b> <b>hatch,</b> which saves weight, while a dual-wave rear glass design helps cut drag.|$|E
25|$|The GRMN 86 Concept is {{a version}} of Toyota 86 that {{incorporates}} the technical expertise gained through the 24 Hours Nürburgring endurance race, achieving optimal vehicle weight reduction, a lower center of gravity, an enhanced powertrain and improved body rigidity.

50|$|The Chevrolet Corvette {{was first}} offered with an opening <b>rear</b> glass <b>hatch</b> for the 1982 Collector Edition model. It was adopted on all Corvette Coupes {{beginning}} in 1984, with the fourth generation models.|$|R
25|$|Other {{changes would}} be a redesigned, more {{integrated}} sunshade and spoiler on the <b>rear</b> <b>hatch.</b> The rear spoiler was changed from a one-piece to a two-piece. The L-types of this year were not available with a leather interior, but P-types were. Toyota added a standard factory theft deterrent system and the outside mirrors were equipped with a defogger that activated with the rear defroster. All Supras this year received automatic-off lights that also encompassed an automatic illuminated entry and fade-out system.|$|E
25|$|The new Fronte was a {{big step}} away from the SS20, making the switch from a rear-engined, rear-wheel drive {{configuration}} to a more up-to-date transversely mounted engine in front, driving the front wheels. Wheelbase was increased from 2030 to 2150mm and the new car was much more spacious. The four-door Fronte had an opening rear glass window, whereas the two-door Alto got a proper <b>rear</b> <b>hatch.</b> In some export markets the car was just known as the Suzuki SS40. In Europe, the Fronte (labelled Alto) was also sold with a 796cc four-stroke three (SS80) from July 1981 and was 100mm longer, thanks to bigger bumpers. These cars also received larger 12-inch wheels. Four-doors received the SS80F chassis code, while three-door passenger versions were called SS80G.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of its operation, the BMD-1 had no analogues abroad. Its main {{armament}} was a 73mm smoothbore gun with a coaxial 7.62mm PKT machine gun. It also had a launcher rail for the 9M14 Malyutka. Additional armaments include two bow-mounted 7.62mm PKT machine guns in the front part of the vehicle, in addition to one ball joint firing port on either side and cover of the <b>rear</b> <b>hatch</b> to fire from individual weapons. The vehicle also featured a hydropneumatic suspension system capable of changing its ground clearance. A low weight of 7.5 t allowed it to be light enough to parachute from any types of military-transport aircraft. This airborne infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) also possessed one of the highest power-to-weight ratios at 32hp/tonne. The BMD-1 was the first domestically produced vehicle equipped with aluminum armor to ensure its light weight. The engineering incorporated in the BMD-1 allowed it {{to be used as a}} base vehicle for multiple variants including the BMD-1K and the BTR-D.|$|E

25|$|The AL10 RX's new {{exterior}} styling adopts the L-finesse design language, {{and outer}} features include a rear spoiler which hides {{the rear window}} wiper and radio antenna creating a less cluttered appearance. The drag coefficient on the latest RX 350 {{has been reduced to}} 0.33 C'd. Exterior dimensions are increased, with cargo room increased by five percent over the prior generation. For the interior, major standard features include SmartAccess, a keyless entry and start system, electrochromic heated side mirrors, UV reducing exterior glass, Bluetooth, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power 10-way driver and passenger seats, sliding and reclining rear seats and a power <b>rear</b> <b>hatch.</b> The instrument cluster's multi-function display uses an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display instead of a thin film transistor (TFT-LCD) display. New cabin technologies include VoiceBox Technologies conversational speech voice recognition system, {{the first of its kind}} in the U.S., which can recognize general speech commands. The new hard disk drive HDD-based navigation system no longer uses a touchscreen, instead replacing it with Lexus' Remote Touch controller, similar in function to a computer mouse, with haptic feedback. Optional accessory features include XM Satellite Radio, a 15-speaker 330-watt Mark Levinson Surround Sound audio system, a dual-screen Rear Seat Entertainment System (RSES), 19-inch wheels, heated and ventilated front seats, power front seat cushion extender, perforated and semi-aniline leather seats, a smog sensor for the HVAC system, power folding side view mirrors, and navigation system.

500|$|The Ford Pinto {{went on sale}} on September 11, 1970 in one bodystyle, a {{fastback}} sedan with {{trunk and}} metal trunklid. [...] A hatchback became available on February 20, 1971, debuting at the Chicago Auto Show. In 1971, the Pinto brochure came with a paper cutout Pinto that one could fold to make a 3D model. Marketed as the Runabout, the hatchback went on sale five days later, priced at $2,062. The hatch itself featured exposed chrome hinges for the liftgate and five decorative chrome strips, pneumatic struts to assist in opening the hatch, a rear window approximately {{as large as the}} sedan's, and a fold down seat — a feature which became simultaneously an option on the sedan. The hatchback model matched the sedan in all other dimensions and offered [...] of cargo space with its seat folded. By 1972, Ford redesigned the hatch itself, with the glass portion of the hatch enlarged to almost the entire size of the hatch itself, ultimately to be replaced with a <b>rear</b> <b>hatch</b> that was entirely glass.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{evacuation}} of Rabaul, Lerew took command of a composite squadron in Port Moresby which later became No.32 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron. On 11February 1942, he led a flight of three Hudsons in a raid on Gasmata harbour, making what the official history of the RAAF in World WarII described as [...] "the first mast-height attack on enemy shipping in the New Guinea campaign". Having set two ships on fire, the Hudsons were attacked by enemy fighters and two were shot down, including Lerew's. With his aircraft in flames, he ordered his crew to bail out of the <b>rear</b> <b>hatch</b> while he parachuted from the front window. Lerew landed in the jungle and narrowly avoided capture before making {{his way to a}} Coastwatcher post and returning to Port Moresby in a schooner, nine days after having been posted missing; his crew members had died. On 7April, Lerew was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for [...] "outstanding courage, determination, skill and tenacity in the course of bombing raids on enemy positions in New Britain". The success of the Gasmata operation prompted the Chief of the Air Staff to commend Lerew's squadron for the [...] "effort required by both crews and ground personnel owing to our small numbers and general condition".|$|E
2500|$|A {{defensive}} armament subsystem, the XM32 provides pintle mounts {{for either}} M60D 7.62×51mm machine guns or M2HB [...]50 caliber machine guns at both cargo door positions and at both <b>rear</b> emergency <b>hatches</b> of the CH-47 helicopter, with weapons feeding from standard ammunition boxes.

50|$|The Bushmaster is a mine {{protected}} {{vehicle and}} provides {{a high degree of}} protection against land mines, using its v-hull monocoque to deflect the blast away from the vehicle and its occupants. The vehicle's armour provides protection against small arms of up to 7.62 mm ball ammunition, 81mm mortar fragments, Claymore mines, and with additional applique armor, protection for armour piercing ammunition of up to 7.62mm. The fuel and hydraulic tanks of the vehicle are located outside the crew compartment, while it also has an automatic fire suppression system. The troop carrier variant of the Bushmaster is fitted with one gun ring. The forward gun ring can be fitted with a 5.56 mm or 7.62 mm machine gun. The two <b>rear</b> <b>hatches</b> each have a mounting boss to allow the attachment of a swing mount capable of holding a 7.62 mm machine gun.|$|R

Inside scarlet leather combined with a roof-mounted Panasonic stereo for a dramatic environment. 45 Essex Esprits were built, interspersed and followed by a number of non-Essex-liveried but otherwise identical specification dry sump turbo cars.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most notable}} {{exterior}} change was {{the switch to}} wraparound front turn signals. Also on the outside the tail-lights were redesigned and the hatch received a billboard [...] "Supra" [...] sticker instead of the smaller sticker, which was previously positioned on the right. The <b>rear</b> <b>hatch</b> and bumper was changed and received {{the same color as}} the rest of the car (instead of the black of previous years). The door handles were also switched around, opening by pulling up instead of sideways. This year Toyota also decided to offer two-tone paint schemes on both the P-type and L-type.|$|E
5000|$|T-26T (T {{stands for}} tyagach or [...] "prime mover", [...] "tractor") — {{armoured}} artillery tractor {{based on the}} T-26 chassis.
