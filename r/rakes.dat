5|$|Competition {{with the}} GCR on outer {{suburban}} services on the extension line saw {{the introduction of}} more comfortable Dreadnought Stock carriages from 1910. Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with pressurised gas lighting and steam heating. Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. Later formed into <b>rakes</b> of five, six or seven coaches, conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive to help prevent gapping. Two <b>rakes</b> were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages.|$|E

50|$|The typical early horse-drawn hay <b>rake</b> was a dump <b>rake,</b> a wide two-wheeled {{implement}} with curved {{steel or}} iron teeth usually operated from a seat mounted over the <b>rake</b> with a lever-operated lifting mechanism. This <b>rake</b> gathered cut hay into windrows by repeated operation {{perpendicular to the}} windrow, requiring the operator to raise the <b>rake,</b> turn around and drop the teeth to <b>rake</b> {{back and forth in}} order to form the windrow. In some areas, a sweep <b>rake,</b> which could also be a horse-drawn or tractor-mounted implement, could then be used to pick up the windrowed hay and load it onto a wagon.|$|R
5|$|Weeding rakes: As weeding was a {{constant}} issue in the ancient and medieval Chinese agricultural process, {{it led to the}} invention of the weeding rake. The invention of the Chinese weed rake is derived from the invention of the Chinese harrow. In the Chinese agricultural text Qimin Yaoshu written by the Northern Wei Dynasty official Jia Sixie. Harrows were originally called iron-teeth <b>rakes</b> due to its shaping. According to it's shape, the Chinese harrow was divided into three sub-classifications: Strip rake, Y-shaped rake, and square rake. The harrows seen in the murals of the Wei and Jin Dynasties are strip <b>rakes.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{only known}} {{predator}} of the fin whale is the killer whale, {{with at least}} 20 eyewitness and second-hand accounts of attack or harassment. They usually flee and offer little resistance to attack. Only a few confirmed fatalities have occurred. In October 2005, 16 killer whales attacked and killed a fin whale in the Canal de Ballenas, Gulf of California, after chasing it for about an hour. They fed on its sinking carcass for about 15 minutes before leaving the area. In June 2012, a pod of killer whales was seen in La Paz Bay, in the Gulf of California, chasing a fin whale {{for over an hour}} before finally killing it and feeding on its carcass. The whale bore numerous tooth <b>rakes</b> over its back and dorsal fin; several killer whales flanked it on either side, with one individual visible under water biting at its right lower jaw. In July 1908, a whaler reportedly saw two killer whales attack and kill a fin whale off western Greenland. In January 1984, seven were seen from the air circling, holding the flippers, and ramming a fin whale in the Gulf of California, but the observation ended at nightfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} of the ship led to significant public interest in the salvage operation, and caused a great demand for the objects which were brought up. Though many of the objects could not be properly conserved {{at the time and}} subsequently deteriorated, many were documented with pencil sketches and watercolour drawings which survive to this day. John Deane ceased working on the wreck in 1836, but returned in 1840 with new, more destructive methods. With the help of condemned bomb shells filled with gunpowder acquired from the Ordnance Board he blasted his way into parts of the wreck. Fragments of bombs and traces of blasting craters were found during the modern excavations, but {{there was no evidence that}} Deane managed to penetrate the hard layer that had sealed off the Tudor levels. Deane reported retrieving a bilge pump and the lower part of the main mast, both of which would have been located inside the ship. The recovery of small wooden objects like longbows suggests that Deane did manage to penetrate the Tudor levels at some point, though this has been disputed by the excavation project leader Margaret Rule. Newspaper reports on Deane's diving operations in October 1840 report that the ship was clinker built, but since the sterncastle is the only part of the ship with this feature, an alternative explanation has been suggested: Deane did not penetrate the hard shelly layer that covered most of the ship, but only managed to get into remains of the sterncastle that today no longer exist. Despite the rough handling by Deane the Mary Rose escaped the wholesale destruction by giant <b>rakes</b> and explosives that was the fate of other wrecks in the Solent.|$|E
50|$|A fire <b>rake</b> is a {{wildland}} fire fighting tool. A fire <b>rake</b> has a wooden or fiberglass handle with a <b>rake</b> head consisting of four very sharp, serrated, triangular steel blades. It {{is used to}} <b>rake</b> a fire break with the sharp teeth enabling it to reach fire in undergrowth in addition to loose surface debris. Another type of fire <b>rake</b> which {{looks more like a}} steel <b>rake</b> but with sharp edges on the teeth, and is sometimes referred to as a <b>rake</b> hoe is called a McLeod. The teeth of the more traditional fire <b>rake</b> which resemble the teeth of a great white shark allow it to get deeper into the undergrowth when necessary. But the preference for one over the other is somewhat subjective.|$|R

30|$|While <b>raking</b> reduced bole damage, {{it did not}} {{eliminate}} it. Over half of the <b>raked</b> trees experienced bole scorch (Figure 4 A), and some <b>raked</b> trees experienced cambium mortality (Figure 3). Apparently, materials outside our 1.0 m <b>rake</b> zone often burned hot enough to scorch trees, suggesting that larger fuel removal zones might sometimes be needed to fully prevent damage. Alternatively, because it was infeasible to completely <b>rake</b> away very fine duff, and because some litter likely accumulated over the {{three to four years}} between <b>raking</b> and burning, small quantities of litter and duff were present in <b>rake</b> zones at the time of burning, and consumption of this material may have contributed to damage of <b>raked</b> trees. Removing fine duff with additional tools, such as the leaf blowers employed by Fowler et al. (2010), may further reduce bole damage, as might burning sooner following <b>raking.</b>|$|R

25|$|Both CR and WR competed {{to acquire}} the <b>rake,</b> with WR even announcing a time table for {{operating}} the air-conditioned <b>rake.</b> Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu announced that the <b>rake</b> would be transferred to CR on 16 March 2016. However, at a height of 4.335 metres the <b>rake</b> exceeds the maximum clearance height of 4.270 metres for EMU coaches on the Central Line. In particular, the <b>rake</b> cannot clear the some low height British-era bridges between CST and Kurla. Then Central Railway general manager Sunil Kumar Sood insisted that CR was conduct trials and operate the <b>rake</b> on the Harbour Line. After acquiring the <b>rake,</b> CR conducted tests, safety and mobility checks, and trial runs {{under the supervision of}} the RDSO. However, following Sood's retirement, CR abandoned plans to operate the <b>rake</b> in December 2016. CR informed the Railway Board that it could not operate the <b>rake</b> due to the clearance issue, and the Railway Board directed them to transfer the <b>rake</b> to WR. The <b>rake</b> was transferred to WR on 12 May 2017. WR General Manager Anil Kumar Gupta stated that <b>rake</b> would begin commercial operations on the Western Line after WR conducted its own tests and trial runs and receiving regulatory approvals. Although there are some clearance issues on the Western Line as well, Gupta stated that these could rectified.|$|R

30|$|Raking was an {{effective}} means of reducing sugar pine mortality following prescribed fire under specific conditions. Raking had little effect on mortality when average forest floor fuel depth was low, but significantly reduced mortality when it was high. In addition, <b>raking</b> had little effect on mortality when fire intensity was low, as most trees survived regardless of <b>raking.</b> When fire intensity was high, <b>raking</b> did little to mitigate mortality. However, when fire intensity fell between these two extremes, <b>raking</b> was {{an effective}} method for reducing post-fire mortality. By measuring the effects of <b>raking</b> on mortality across a wide range of burn severities over multiple prescribed fires, we were able to demonstrate this interaction between fire intensity and the efficacy of <b>raking</b> treatments, and provide a mechanism to explain the contradictory results of previous studies. Along with the direct effect of <b>raking</b> on reducing stem charring, <b>raking</b> may also help prevent additional post-fire mortality from beetle attacks as beetle activity was significantly lower in <b>raked</b> trees compared to unraked trees following fire. The differences in mortality between <b>raked</b> and unraked trees may therefore become even larger {{over the next few years}} as beetle-attacked trees continue to die (Agee 2003).|$|R
50|$|Later, a {{mechanically}} {{more complicated}} <b>rake</b> was developed, {{known as the}} side delivery <b>rake.</b> This usually had a gear-driven or chain-driven reel mounted roughly at a 45-degree angle to the windrow, so the hay was gathered and pushed {{to one side of}} the <b>rake</b> as it moved across the field. A side delivery <b>rake</b> could be pulled longitudinally along the windrow by horses or a tractor, eliminating the laborious and inefficient process of raising, lowering, and back-and-forth <b>raking</b> required by a dump <b>rake.</b> This allowed for the continuous spiraling windrows of a classic mid-20th-century farm hayfield. Later versions of the side delivery <b>rake</b> used a more severe transverse angle and a higher frame system, but the basic principles of operation were the same.|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{ability to}} trace request {{execution}} paths {{is critical for}} diagnosing performance faults in large-scale distributed systems. Previous black-box and white-box approaches are either inaccurate or invasive. We present a novel semantics-assisted gray-box tracing approach, called <b>Rake,</b> which can accurately trace individual request by observing network traffic. <b>Rake</b> infers the causality between messages by identifying polymorphic IDs in messages according to application semantics. To make <b>Rake</b> universally applicable, we design a <b>Rake</b> language so that users can easily describe necessary semantics of their applications while reusing the core <b>Rake</b> component. We evaluate <b>Rake</b> using a few popular distributed applications, including web search, distributed computing cluster, content provider network, and online chatting. Our results demonstrate <b>Rake</b> is much more accurate than the black-box approaches while requiring no modification to OS/applications. In the CoralCDN (a content distributed network) experiments, <b>Rake</b> links messages with much higher accuracy than WAP 5, a state-of-the-art blackbox approach. In the Hadoop (a distributed computing cluster platform) experiments, <b>Rake</b> helps reveal several previously unknown issues {{that may lead to}} performance degradation, including a RPC (Remote Procedure Call) abusing problem.
