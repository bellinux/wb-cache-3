40|$|The {{teaching}} of electrical machines and drives requires {{a new approach}} to make them more attractive to students, to address and overcome the limitations of time and resources that are usual in electrical engineering programs. The target of this new approach is that after following the course students should have a consistent knowledge and skills on electric machines and drives that gives them the ability to deal, with solvency, any problem related with them. In this paper, following these assumptions, <b>reluctance</b> <b>motors</b> are introduced considering that the different types of <b>reluctances</b> <b>motors</b> are derived from a common origin that is the singly-excited electromechanical converter.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{inductance}} characteristics present in single tooth wound synchronous <b>reluctance</b> <b>motors,</b> specifically the stator leakage inductance. Despite {{the nature of}} the single tooth design resulting in increased air gap harmonic content, having has consequences for the machines' design, performance & operation, the topology has been shown previously to be competitive for high efficiency drives. A key design constraint in the design of synchronous <b>reluctance</b> <b>motors</b> is maximizing the direct axis inductance and minimizing the quadrature axis inductance for a high saliency ratio. The effect of increased leakage inductance on this saliency ratio is explored with emphasis placed on design aspects of such single tooth wound synchronous <b>reluctance</b> <b>motors.</b> It is shown that careful design of the machine is required to maximize the saliency ratio in this machine topology and that the dominant leakage inductance component is the air gap harmonic leakage...|$|R

40|$|The {{inherent}} {{advantages of}} three phase <b>reluctance</b> <b>motors</b> {{have called for}} their use in applications requiring constant speed. This has created a growing interest in this field, and considerable effort has been spent in analyzing the steady state and dynamic behaviour of these motors. Single phase operation of three phase <b>reluctance</b> <b>motors</b> has been suggested recently as a practical possibility that extends the range of applications of such motors and adds flexibility to their modes of operation.

50|$|A {{step motor}} {{can be viewed}} as a {{synchronous}} AC motor with the number of poles (on both rotor and stator) increased, taking care that they have no common denominator. Additionally, soft magnetic material with many teeth on the rotor and stator cheaply multiplies the number of poles (<b>reluctance</b> <b>motor).</b> Modern steppers are of hybrid design, having both permanent magnets and soft iron cores.|$|E

50|$|<b>Reluctance</b> <b>motor</b> designs have ratings {{that range}} from {{fractional}} horsepower (a few watts) to about 22 kW. Very small reluctance motors have low torque, and are generally used for instrumentation applications. Moderate torque, integral horsepower motors use squirrel cage construction with toothed rotors. When used with an adjustable frequency power supply, all motors in the drive system can be controlled {{at exactly the same}} speed. The power supply frequency determines motor operating speed.|$|E
50|$|There are {{3 phases}} in an {{asymmetric}} bridge converter {{corresponding to the}} phases of the switched <b>reluctance</b> <b>motor.</b> If both of the power switches {{on either side of}} the phase are turned on, then that corresponding phase shall be actuated.

50|$|The {{main idea}} of this system {{is to use a}} linear <b>reluctance</b> <b>motor</b> for drive, {{guidance}} and suspension. This motor uses the same forces that drive rotative motors, but without a mechanical transmission to apply the torque to the vehicle wheels. Instead, these forces are applied between the vehicle and the rail, reducing mechanical friction and wear. Also, the TELMAGV can climb steeper gradients than a conventional system because it does not depend on friction between wheel and rail for propulsion.|$|E
