5|$|During {{the scene}} at the town hall, several {{citizens}} are seen stroking guns: Smithers has a <b>revolver,</b> an unidentified woman also has a <b>revolver,</b> Moe has a shotgun, Skinner has a semi-automatic handgun with a suppressor attached, and Barney has a derringer.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Revolver</b> Golden Gods Awards is {{an annual}} awards {{ceremony}} held by <b>Revolver,</b> an American hard rock and heavy metal magazine. Slipknot has won Five awards. Lead Singer/Frontman Corey Taylor has won one.|$|E
5000|$|The Howard Auto Cultivator Company (HAC) in New South Wales, Australia tooled up {{and began}} {{manufacturing}} the Enfield No 2 Mk I* and I** <b>revolvers</b> in 1941, but the production run was very limited (estimated at around 350 or so <b>revolvers</b> in total), and the <b>revolvers</b> produced were criticised for being non-interchangeable, even with other HAC-produced <b>revolvers.</b> Very few HAC <b>revolvers</b> are known to exist, and it is thought by many collectors {{that most of the}} HAC <b>revolvers</b> may have been destroyed in the various Australian Gun Amnesties and [...] "Buy-Backs".|$|R
50|$|In total, 47,454 Starr <b>revolvers</b> were {{manufactured}} {{making it}} the third most issued of civil war era <b>revolvers</b> (6,352 Starr DA Navy and Army <b>revolvers</b> were purchased on the open market).|$|R
25|$|The 8th carried Savage <b>Revolvers,</b> {{as well as}} some Colts Army <b>revolvers.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Webley is a top-break <b>revolver</b> and {{breaking}} the <b>revolver</b> operates the extractor, which removes cartridges from the cylinder. The Webley Mk I service <b>revolver</b> was adopted in 1887 and the Mk IV, rose to prominence during the Boer War of 1899–1902. The Mk VI, introduced in 1915 during the First World War, {{is perhaps the}} best-known model.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} <b>Revolver</b> marked {{the last time}} that Capitol issued an altered UK Beatles album for the North American market. When the Beatles re-signed with EMI in January 1967, their {{contract}} stipulated that Capitol could no longer alter the track listings of their albums. The April 1987 CD release of <b>Revolver</b> standardised the track listing to the original UK version. In January 2014, the Capitol version of <b>Revolver</b> was issued on CD for the first time, both as part of the Beatles' U.S. Albums box set and as an individual release. As of that year, <b>Revolver</b> had been certified 5x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2013, after the British Phonographic Industry altered its sales award protocol, the album was certified Platinum based on UK sales since 1994.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday {{believed}} that Tom had a <b>revolver</b> {{at the time}} of the gunfight. Wyatt thought Tom fired a <b>revolver</b> under the horse's neck and believed until he died that Tom's <b>revolver</b> had been removed from the scene by Wesley Fuller. Witness Fallehy wrote that he saw Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting at a man who was using a horse to barricade himself, and once shot the man fell. In his statement, Fallehy wrote that the man still held his pistol in his hand. Although he did not see him shoot, he thought Tom McLaury was armed.|$|E
50|$|Most hunting handguns {{are either}} single-shot pistols, {{double-action}} <b>revolvers,</b> or single-action <b>revolvers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 8th carried Savage <b>Revolvers,</b> {{as well as}} some Colts Army <b>revolvers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Whilst the top-break, self-extracting <b>revolvers</b> {{used by the}} British and Commonwealth militaries are {{the best-known}} {{examples}} of Webley <b>Revolvers,</b> the company produced {{a number of other}} highly popular <b>revolvers</b> largely intended for the police and civilian markets.|$|R
5|$|Milt Joyce, {{a county}} {{supervisor}} {{and owner of}} the Oriental Saloon, had a contentious relationship with Doc Holliday. In October 1880, Holliday had trouble with a gambler named Johnny Tyler in Milt Joyce's Oriental Saloon. Tyler had been hired by a competing gambling establishment to drive customers from the Oriental Saloon. Holliday challenged Tyler to a fight, but Tyler ran. Joyce did not like Holliday or the Earps and he continued to argue with Holliday. Joyce ordered Holliday removed from the saloon but would not return Holliday's <b>revolver.</b> But Holliday returned carrying a double-action <b>revolver.</b> Milt brandished a pistol and threatened Holliday, but Holliday shot Joyce in the palm, disarming him, and then shot Joyce's business partner William Parker in the big toe. Joyce then hit Holliday over the head with his <b>revolver.</b> Holliday was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault and battery.|$|E
5|$|The Wyatt <b>revolver</b> from Boyer's {{estate was}} {{expected}} to fetch from $100,000 and $150,000. On {{the day of the}} auction, more than 6,400 online bidders and over 400 collectors from 49 countries took part in the auction. The <b>revolver</b> attributed to Wyatt Earp was sold to an unnamed phone bidder from New Mexico for $225,000. The Winchester lever-action shotgun also said to be Wyatt Earp's sold for $50,000, below the high value estimate of $125,000.|$|E
5|$|There was {{one report}} {{that her father}} gave Olga a small <b>revolver,</b> which she {{concealed}} in a boot while in captivity at Tsarskoe Selo and at Tobolsk. Colonel Eugene Kobylynsky, their sympathetic jailer, pleaded with the grand duchess to surrender her <b>revolver</b> before she, her sisters, and brother were transferred to Yekaterinburg. Olga reluctantly gave up her gun and was left unarmed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Webley <b>revolvers,</b> the British and Canadian armies also ordered several thousand Smith & Wesson [...]44 Hand Ejector <b>revolvers,</b> chambered in [...]455 Webley, {{in a rush to}} equip their troops for the Great War. The urgency was such that the earliest of these were converted from <b>revolvers</b> already completed and chambered for [...]44 Special. Approximately 60,000 Colt New Service <b>revolvers</b> were also purchased, in [...]455.|$|R
5000|$|Smith & Wesson [...]38/44 {{identifies}} {{a series}} of Smith & Wesson N-frame <b>revolvers</b> chambered for the [...]38 Special cartridge loaded to higher pressures than were considered appropriate for earlier <b>revolvers</b> of that caliber. High-pressure [...]38/44 loadings represent a transition between conventional [...]38 Special ammunition and the [...]357 Magnum. <b>Revolvers</b> were manufactured from 1930 to 1941, and after World War II until lower-priced [...]357 Magnum <b>revolvers</b> became widely available.|$|R
50|$|Iver Johnson {{nomenclature}} {{refers to}} its top-break <b>revolvers</b> as Safety Automatics. These are <b>revolvers,</b> not semi-automatic pistols, which they largely pre-date. The term “Safety Automatic” refers to Iver Johnson’s Hammer-the-Hammer transfer bar safety system (“safety”) and the automatic ejection of cartridges upon breaking open the <b>revolvers</b> (“automatic”).|$|R
5|$|While on {{tour with}} Velvet <b>Revolver</b> in 2008, McKagan stated that Loaded were {{to release a}} new album {{in the summer and}} were to enter the studio in April. Soon after the end of their tour, Velvet <b>Revolver</b> {{announced}} the departure of Weiland, putting the group on hiatus until they find a new singer. Previously, the Loaded members worked on material by sending mp3 files to each other.|$|E
5|$|A Slovene {{account of}} the same event asserts that the {{soldiers}} began to fire only when an Austrian citizen discharged a <b>revolver</b> {{in the direction of}} the Slovene soldiers, striking the bayonet of one. The soldiers then returned fire: according to this account 11 were killed, and an unknown number wounded.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} to Colt's success was {{vigorous}} protection of his patent rights. Even though he lawfully held the only patent on a <b>revolver,</b> scores of imitators copied {{his work and}} Colt found himself constantly in litigation. In {{each one of these}} cases, Colt's lawyer, Edward N. Dickerson, deftly exploited the patent system and successfully shut down Colt's competitors. However, Colt's zealous protection of his patents greatly impeded firearms development as a whole in the United States. His preoccupation with patent infringement suits slowed his own company's transition to the cartridge system and blocked other firms from pursuing <b>revolver</b> designs. At the same time, Colt's policies forced some competing inventors to greater innovation by denying them key features of his mechanism; as a result they created their own.|$|E
500|$|After the {{publication}} of Lake's book, various Colt <b>revolvers</b> with long (10" [...] or 16") barrels were referred to as [...] "Colt Buntlines". Colt re-introduced the <b>revolvers</b> in its second generation <b>revolvers</b> produced after 1956. The Buntline Special was further popularized by The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp television series.|$|R
5000|$|The {{frame of}} early Open Top <b>revolvers</b> were marked COLT'S/PATENT, later models sported the {{so-called}} [...] "Two July" [...] patent marking, also {{found on the}} 1851 Navy-, 1861 Navy- and 1860 Army-conversion <b>revolvers.</b> The [...] "Two July" [...] patents were also found on very early Colt Single Action Army <b>revolvers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{company also}} {{manufactured}} Wesson & Leavitt <b>revolvers</b> between 1850 and 1851. These {{were said to}} be the first <b>revolvers</b> patented after Colt's.|$|R
5|$|Billy Clanton {{was armed}} with Colt Frontier 1873 revolvers which were {{identified}} by their serial numbers at the Spicer hearing. C.S. Fly found Billy Clanton's empty <b>revolver</b> in his hand where he lay and took it from him.|$|E
5|$|It is an {{amalgamation}} {{of design}} features from other revolvers {{made during the}} time period. The <b>revolver</b> has a design flaw in that the cylinder freewheels when not engaged, so during movement (such as in combat) it may rotate to an already fired chamber. Five distinct phases of production have different markings depending on the time and individual Type 26 produced. The 9mm Japanese <b>revolver</b> ammunition used is unique to the weapon. The Type 26 has a double-action only mechanism and is therefore difficult to aim accurately. The Type 26 {{was replaced by the}} Nambu pistol {{in the first half of}} the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The Enfield-designed pistol {{was quickly}} {{accepted}} under the designation Pistol, <b>Revolver,</b> No. 2 Mk I, and was adopted in 1932, followed in 1938 by the Mk I* (spurless hammer, double action only), {{and finally the}} Mk I** (simplified for wartime production) in 1942.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cartridge}} case itself {{was designed by}} cutting off the [...]348 Winchester case to 1.405 in, turning the rim to a diameter of [...]610 in and opening the case mouth to accept a [...]510 caliber (12.95 mm) bullet. The first <b>revolvers</b> converted to use the [...]500 Linebaugh were the Ruger Bisley and the Seville <b>revolvers.</b> Due {{to the demise of}} the Seville <b>revolvers</b> in the early 1990s, all subsequent conversions have been carried out on <b>revolvers</b> based on the Ruger Bisley frame.|$|R
5000|$|Taurus was {{originally}} known for manufacturing <b>revolvers</b> similar in design to those offered by Smith & Wesson. The company {{moved away from}} this realm by offering larger framed models such as the Raging Bull (.454 Casull) and Raging Hornet (.22 Hornet) <b>revolvers</b> {{as well as the}} Judge 5-shot <b>revolvers</b> (.410 bore and [...]45 Colt).|$|R
50|$|Ruger {{breaks down}} their {{products}} into nine categories: bolt-action rifles, single-shot rifles, autoloading rifles, lever-action rifles, shotguns, centerfire pistols, rimfire pistols, double-action <b>revolvers,</b> and single-action <b>revolvers.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Type 26 <b>revolver</b> is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, {{weighing}} 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The <b>revolver</b> is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese <b>revolver</b> ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 <b>Revolver</b> and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The Type 90 {{tear gas}} grenade {{launcher}} {{was developed to}} be fired with the Type 26 <b>revolver.</b> Gas grenades could be fired by a special 9x22 mm cartridge {{in place of the}} regular ball ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} envisioned {{to improve the}} core {{mechanics}} of Red Dead <b>Revolver</b> (2004), to which Redemption is a spiritual successor, by scaling {{it up to the}} standard of other Rockstar games. The fundamental goal for the game was to maintain the shooting mechanic and expand on other game features; like <b>Revolver,</b> the game's weapons were inspired by real weaponry. Carson explained that the team attempted to achieve realism with every feature of the game, including the horses, lassos, animal ecosystem, and the open world. To assure that the horse movements were as realistic as possible, the team motion captured a stunt horse, recording all movement. This created various problems; a gesture used by the stunt rider to communicate with the production team while on the horse was also the same command that made the horse rear. Furthermore, creating the horse's skeletal and muscular systems also presented a problem, and took several years to overcome. In the early stages of development, Rockstar decided which elements from Red Dead <b>Revolver</b> could be carried over; beyond the Dead Eye feature and the Western setting, very few other features remained. While <b>Revolver</b> represented many myths and iconic images of the American frontier, in Redemption the team tried to represent the reality of the time period. The tone of Redemption was aimed to be a combination of the primitive Wild West and early 20th century America; with the latter, America was developing into a modern and contemporary society, which the team tried to portray. In addition, while they felt that <b>Revolver</b> was constrained by its level-based structure, the team saw potential in creating a game similar to that of Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto series, in terms of quality, scope and detail.|$|E
5|$|Early {{production}} Type 26s have no external markings. The <b>revolvers</b> have markings {{that indicate}} they were arsenal re-worked and {{believed to have}} been produced in late 1893 or early 1894 before official adoption. It is possible that around 300 <b>revolvers</b> with no external marking were produced. No known examples of Type 26 <b>revolvers</b> have duplicate serial numbers.|$|R
500|$|A {{small number}} of <b>revolvers</b> {{are known to have}} the {{external}} arsenal symbol stamped but without the external serial number stamped on the frame. The <b>revolvers</b> are interspersed among <b>revolvers</b> with standard production markings for unknown reasons. This production range has examples reported to chamber [...]38 S ammunition but this could be because of later modification.|$|R
