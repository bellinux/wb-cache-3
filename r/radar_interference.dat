5|$|Schnaufer's {{greatest}} one-night {{success and}} {{the second time he}} became an ace-in-a-day was on 21 February 1945, when he claimed nine Lancaster heavy bombers in the course of one day. Two were claimed {{in the early hours of}} the morning and a further seven, in just 19 minutes, in the evening between 20:44 and 21:03. Schnaufer was one of the influential figures that instigated a brief return to mass intruder operations over England named Operation Gisela. General der Nachtjagd (General of Night Fighters), was Generalleutnant Schmid, commanding I. Jagdkorps and Kammhuber, commanding XII. Fliegerkorps, and de facto command-in-chief of the German Night Fighter Force until November 1943, had long since desired to return to intruder operations over Bomber Command bases in England. The proposals met resistance from Hans-Jürgen Stumpff, Chief of the General Staff. Eventually, in October 1944, Schmid won support from Streib, Inspekteur der Nachtjagd, to begin planning an operation. Schnaufer voiced his support also. In his experience, he had regularly pursued RAF bombers to the English coast, or least the other side of the frontline. In British airspace, and over territory the Germans did not control, he experienced a lack of <b>radar</b> <b>interference.</b> Schnaufer recalled that he could fly around as if it was peace time, since all British jamming and interference stopped immediately once he was in Allied airspace.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{quantify}} the temporal opportunities for secondary access in radar bands. Secondary users {{are assumed to}} be WLANs which opportunistically access the radar spectrum. Each WLAN device employs dynamic frequency selec-tion (DFS) as a mechanism to protect the <b>radar</b> from <b>interference.</b> We also consider an advanced interference protection mechanism, which is termed temporal DFS. It exploits the temporal variation of interference power due to the rotation of radar antenna. It is observed that the probability of accessing the radar band is significantly higher when the temporal DFS is used compared to the conventional DFS. As a consequence, more WLANs utilize the radar spectrum when the temporal DFS mechanism is considered. This shows that having better knowledge of the primary user activity can bring about the increased opportunity of secondary spectrum access, and thus improve the spectrum utilization.

50|$|Continuous-wave radar {{is a type}} of {{radar system}} where a known stable {{frequency}} continuous-wave radio energy is transmitted and then received from any reflecting objects. Continuous-wave (CW) radar uses Doppler, which renders the <b>radar</b> immune to <b>interference</b> from large stationary objects and slow moving clutter.|$|R
5000|$|Basic radar ECM {{strategies}} are (1) <b>radar</b> <b>interference,</b> (2) target modifications, and (3) changing the electrical properties of air. [...] Interference techniques include jamming and deception. Jamming {{is accomplished by}} a friendly platform transmitting signals on the radar frequency to produce a noise level sufficient to hide echos. [...] The jammer's continuous transmissions will provide a clear direction to the enemy radar, but no range information. [...] Deception may use a transponder to mimic the radar echo with a delay to indicate incorrect range. [...] Transponders may alternatively increase return echo strength {{to make a small}} decoy appear to be a larger target. [...] Target modifications include radar absorbing coatings and modifications of the surface shape to either [...] "stealth" [...] a high-value target or enhance reflections from a decoy. [...] Dispersal of small aluminium strips called chaff is a common method of changing the electromagnetic properties of air to provide confusing radar echos.|$|E

She reached Midway after four days travel and stopped briefly to top up her fuel tanks (having consumed 14,000 gallons already) and to repair a defective motor-generator for her new SJ radar. She reached Okinoshima on 25 October and quickly found her daylight activities constrained by a heavy fishing sampan presence. Over the early morning of 29 October she detected, tracked, and closed on a freighter and small anti-submarine warfare escort. Halibut was detected and the escort drove her off and held her at bay with fifteen depth charge attacks as the freighter fled. Resurfacing, a lookout noticed the smoke of a distant convoy. The submarine closed as the daylight faded, coming close enough to submerge for periscope observation {{on the morning of}} 1 November. The convoy consisted of seven freighters and three Otori-type torpedo boats as escorts. Halibut launched three torpedoes from 6500 yd at 06:52 and made no hits; the freighters turned away and two torpedo boats closed but were ineffective in locating the submarine. Around midday, Halibut headed south after the convoy, surfacing as night fell.

Latta responded at 22:45 that his boat was {{in contact with}} a convoy, tracking it on a base course of 310° (T), speed nine knots (17 km/h), running along the 5 to 7 fathom curve (10 m). There was one large ship, one medium, and two escorts, both of which appeared to be equipped with 10-centimeter radar. Beneath a clear, dark, sky, Baya began her attack at 12 kn through the flat sea, from off the convoy’s starboard bow, setting her torpedoes to run at four feet. Soon she began encountering SJ and 10-centimeter <b>radar</b> <b>interference</b> “all around the dial.” Two additional contacts materialized—one {{turned out to be}} a large three-masted junk, the other proved to be Lagarto. Baya, however, soon had her hands full; as her commanding officer later reported: “Jap gunnery poor but plenty of it. Tracers passing down both sides of the periscope shears and overhead...” Both escort vessels—one of which Baya identified as a “Shiretaka-type minelayer”—gave a good account of themselves; at 23:33, Baya informed Lagarto “that we had been driven off by gunfire.” Baya’s skipper later ruminated: “It is nothing short of a miracle that we came through so much gun fire without a single hit.” “We were in a continuous hail of lead, fire, and steel and sustained not a scratch.” ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{capacity}} of a communications channel that, in addition to additive white Gaussian noise, also suffers from interference caused by a co-existing radar transmission. The <b>radar</b> <b>interference</b> (of short duty-cycle and of much wider bandwidth than the intended communication signal) is modeled as an additive term whose amplitude is known and constant, but whose phase is independent and identically uniformly distributed at each channel use. The capacity achieving input distribution, under the standard average power constraint, is shown to have independent modulo and phase. The phase is uniformly distributed in [0, 2 π]. The modulo is discrete with countably infinitly many mass points, but only finitely many in any bounded interval.

Underutilized radar spectrum due to the directionality and rest periods of rotating radar makes it a viable candidate for spectrum sharing with Wi-Fi. But if operating on the same bands, radar signals would interfere with Wi-Fi receivers, reducing WLAN performance. This thesis investigates Wi-Fi network performance when sharing spectrum with radar.

30|$|Inter-site {{interference}} {{occurs when}} multiple radars {{share the same}} frequency band. Specifically, a signal associated with one radar can interfere with those associated with other <b>radars.</b> The <b>interference</b> inevitably distorts the received signals of the radars, thereby leading to inaccurate estimations of weather parameters. On the other hand, intra-site interference happens even when {{there is only one}} radar operating in the frequency band. It can be regarded as a kind of self-interference due to partial overlap of the multiple backscattered signals that occur when the radar signal is backscattered by closely located multiple targets. This intra-site interference becomes highly serious in a radar system that employs a long pulse (e.g., pulse compression radar) and that deals with volume-type targets (e.g., weather radar).|$|R
