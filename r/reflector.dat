5|$|Berkelium-247 can {{maintain}} chain reaction both in a thermal-neutron {{and in a}} fast-neutron reactor, however, its production is rather complex and thus the availability is much lower than its critical mass, which is about 75.7kg for a bare sphere, 41.2kg with a water <b>reflector</b> and 35.2kg with a steel <b>reflector</b> (30cm thickness).|$|E
5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the <b>reflector</b> sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the <b>reflector.</b> As the sights worked by reflecting light off the <b>reflector</b> in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E

50|$|Corner <b>reflectors</b> {{have the}} same effect as chaff but are {{physically}} very different. Corner <b>reflectors</b> are many-sided objects that re-radiate radar energy mostly back toward its source. An aircraft cannot carry as many corner <b>reflectors</b> as it can chaff.|$|R
3000|$|The {{calculation}} cost for checking module for activating re-plan module A {{depends on the}} number of <b>reflectors</b> that the robots actually detect, which is influenced {{by the total number of}} <b>reflectors</b> that are set in the working environment.

5|$|Einsteinium has a {{high rate}} of nuclear fission that results in a low {{critical}} mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of 254Es isotope, and can be lowered to 2.9 by adding a 30 centimeter thick steel neutron <b>reflector,</b> or even to 2.26 kilograms with a 20cm thick <b>reflector</b> made of water. However, even this small critical mass greatly exceeds the total amount of einsteinium isolated thus far, especially of the rare 254Es isotope.|$|E

40|$|We present {{plasmonic}} Bragg <b>reflectors</b> {{for increasing}} the extraordinary optical transmission through periodic arrays of subwavelength apertures in a metal film. The increase in transmission arises by preventing loss {{at the edges of}} the array. The plasmonic Bragg <b>reflectors</b> have periodicity of half the usual array's periodicity. Nano-hole arrays flanked thus by <b>reflectors</b> exchibited double the transmission as compared to the arrays without <b>reflectors.</b> These structures may also be used to isolate devices in plasmonic integrated circuits...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a method for {{improving}} the optical efficiency of micromachined <b>reflectors</b> integrated in rubidium vapor cells. A hybrid bulk micromachining and multilayer thin film process is used to form the <b>reflectors</b> on angled sidewalls, which redirect laser light through the vapor cell and back toward {{the plane of the}} source with reduced optical power loss. The optical return efficiency of two paired dielectric <b>reflectors</b> is shown to be improved by as much as eight times over silicon <b>reflectors</b> alone. The D 1 absorption line in a one cubic millimeter miniature alkali 87 Rb vapor cell by use of two integrated thin film <b>reflectors</b> is experimentally demonstrated. 1...|$|R

5|$|<b>Reflector</b> sights {{were invented}} as an {{improved}} gun-sight and since their invention {{they have been}} adapted to many types of weapons. When used with different types of guns, <b>reflector</b> sights are considered an improvement over simple iron sights (sights composed of two spaced metal aiming points {{that have to be}} aligned). Iron sights take considerable experience and skill in the user who has to hold a proper eye position and focus exclusively on the front sight, keeping it centered on the (unfocused) rear sight, while keeping the whole centered on a target at different distances, requiring alignment of all three planes of focus to achieve a hit. The <b>reflector</b> sight's single, parallax-free virtual image, in focus with the target, removes this aiming problem, helping poor, average, and expert shooters alike.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the <b>reflector</b> sight being used with fighter aircraft was in 1918. The optical firm of Optische Anstalt Oigee of Berlin, working from the Grubb patents, developed 2 versions {{what came to be}} known as the Oigee <b>Reflector</b> Sight. Both used a 45 degree angle glass beam splitter and electrical illumination and were used to aim the plane's machine guns. One version was used in operational trials on the Albatros D.Va fighter biplane and Fokker Dr.1 fighter triplane. There was some interest in this sight after World War I but <b>reflector</b> sights in general were not widely adopted for fighter and bomber aircraft until the 1930s, first by the French, then by most other major airforces. These sights were not only used for aiming fighter aircraft, they were used with aircraft defensive guns and in bombsights.|$|E
5|$|The {{table to}} the right lists the {{critical}} masses for curium isotopes for a sphere, without a moderator and <b>reflector.</b> With a metal <b>reflector</b> (30cm of steel), the critical masses of the odd isotopes are about 3–4kg. When using water (thickness ~20–30cm) as the <b>reflector,</b> the critical mass can be as small as 59gram for 245Cm, 155gram for 243Cm and 1550gram for 247Cm. There is a significant uncertainty in these critical mass values. Whereas it is usually of the order 20%, the values for 242Cm and 246Cm were listed as large as 371kg and 70.1kg, respectively, by some research groups.|$|E
40|$|We {{installed}} three radar corner <b>reflectors</b> at Pinon Flat Observatory {{located between}} the San Andreas and San Jacinto Faults {{to support the}} radiometric, geometric and interferometric assessment of PALSAR. The <b>reflectors</b> are permanent installations designed to remain {{in place for the}} lifetime of the ALOS mission and beyond. The precise locations of the <b>reflectors</b> and their radiometric design are available to any investigator. We have used 9 repeat swaths of PALSAR data over the <b>reflectors</b> to assess interferometric resolution, precision, and accuracy...|$|R

5000|$|... 1968: As federal {{regulations}} required all automotive manufacturers to add side marker <b>reflectors</b> or lights, Ford redesigned the hood emblems to incorporate <b>reflectors</b> {{as well as}} added <b>reflectors</b> {{to the rear of}} the bed. Interior fittings changed due to new safety standards. New versions of the FE-Series engine added (360 truck and 390). First year of factory-installed air-conditioning (previously, air-conditioning was dealer-installed).|$|R
5|$|The viewing {{portion of}} a <b>reflector</b> sight does not use any {{refractive}} optical elements, {{it is simply a}} projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights. A <b>reflector</b> sight also does not have the field of view and eye relief problems of sights based on optical telescopes: depending on design constraints their field of view is the user's naked eye field of view, and their non-focusing collimated nature means they don't have the optical telescopes constraint of eye relief. <b>Reflector</b> sights can be combined with telescopes, usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected reticle creating a telescopic sight, but this re-introduces the problems of narrow field of view and limited eye relief. The primary drawback of <b>reflector</b> sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function. Reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations, and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails.|$|E
5|$|A {{parabolic}} trough {{consists of a}} linear parabolic <b>reflector</b> that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned right above {{the middle of the}} parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The <b>reflector</b> is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology.|$|E
5|$|An {{amplitude}} splitting interferometer uses {{a partial}} <b>reflector</b> {{to divide the}} amplitude of the incident wave into separate beams which are separated and recombined. Fig.6 illustrates the Fizeau, Mach–Zehnder and Fabry–Pérot interferometers. Other examples of amplitude splitting interferometer include the Michelson, Twyman–Green, Laser Unequal Path, and Linnik interferometer.|$|E
40|$|ODP Leg 138 in {{the eastern}} {{equatorial}} Pacific (EEP) provided {{a unique opportunity to}} understand the paleoceanographic significance of seismic <b>reflectors</b> in this climatically sensitive region. Carefully offset multiple cores were spliced into a complete stratigraphic section for the upper 250 m at each site and accurate, astronomically tuned time scales were generated from these composites. Well log data provided a means to correct composite depths to true depths as well as density and velocity data for the generation of synthetic seismograms. These synthetic seismograms were used to determine the paleoceanographic significance of regionally traceable <b>reflectors</b> by linking variations in the core record to the seismic record. The EEP <b>reflectors</b> are due to changes in carbonate content, primarily due to variations in surface productivity, as indicated by the presence of mats of the upwelling diatom Thalassiothrix longissima. The EEP composite GRAPE records were successfully used as a tuning target for GRAPE records in the central equatorial Pacific (CEP), as a means to detelxnine the basin-wide extent of EEP <b>reflectors,</b> and as a guide to the further interpretation of the CEP seismic record. It was found that EEP <b>reflectors</b> R 3 -t, R 5, R 6, R 8 -b, and Site 844 <b>reflectors</b> R 10, R 12 -b and R 13, correspond to <b>reflectors</b> i n the CEP. However, some of the CEP <b>reflectors,</b> which were postulated to be due to periods of enhanced dissolution, also con 2 ̆ 7 espond to diatom mats, and hence the origin of these <b>reflectors</b> must be reconsidered...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a new class}} of integrated mirrors, so called MMI <b>reflectors.</b> In addition to one-port full <b>reflectors,</b> we introduce two-port MMI <b>reflectors,</b> capable of both reflection and transmission. The reflection to transmission ratio in these devices can be set freely by changing their geometry. This is deinonstrated through numerical simulations as well as through a set ofworking devices realized on an indium phosphide layer stack...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} differences in broadband high-index-contrast grating (HCG) <b>reflectors</b> for TM and TE polarizations is presented, covering various grating parameters and properties of HCGs. It is shown that the HCG <b>reflectors</b> for TM polarization (TM HCG <b>reflectors)</b> have much thicker grating thicknesses and smaller grating periods than the TE HCG <b>reflectors.</b> This difference is found to originate from the different boundary conditions met for the electric field of each polarization. Due to this difference, the TM HCG <b>reflectors</b> have much shorter evanescent extension of HCG modes into low-refractive-index media surrounding the HCG. This enables to achieve a very short effective cavity length for VCSELs, which is essential for ultrahigh speed VCSELs and MEMS-tunable VCSELs. The obtained understandings on polarization dependences {{will be able to}} serve as important design guidelines for various HCG-based devices...|$|R
5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a <b>reflector</b> sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed eye relief), and at almost any angle, without distorting {{the image of the}} target or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since <b>Reflector</b> sights are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|E

5|$|Thin {{film with}} diffuse <b>reflector,</b> {{based on the}} top two layers of a buttercup's petals. The {{brilliant}} yellow gloss derives from a combination, rare among plants, of yellow pigment and structural coloration. The very smooth upper epidermis acts as a reflective and iridescent thin film; for example, in Ranunculus acris, the layer is 2.7 micrometres thick. The unusual starch cells form a diffuse but strong <b>reflector,</b> enhancing the flower's brilliance. The curved petals form a paraboloidal dish which directs the sun's heat to the reproductive parts at {{the centre of the}} flower, keeping it some degrees Celsius above the ambient temperature.|$|E
50|$|Confederations {{can be used}} in {{conjunction}} with route <b>reflectors.</b> Both confederations and route <b>reflectors</b> can be subject to persistent oscillation unless specific design rules, affecting both BGP and the interior routing protocol, are followed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{light was}} {{originally}} provided by nine lamps and <b>reflectors,</b> which were later increased to ten. In 1887 a lens replaced the lamps and <b>reflectors.</b> In 1907 a fourth-order Fresnel lens was installed, providing 360° coverage.|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{thin films}} are {{contributing}} to many fields today, with Bragg <b>reflectors</b> being one of them. Bragg <b>reflectors</b> {{can be used in}} many optical instruments and experiments, as well as practical applications like keeping cars cool in the sun[1]. Here, the production of robust Bragg <b>reflectors</b> with tunable properties is explored using spray layer-by-layer assembly and novel materials. In order to do this, the growth rate of the polyelectrolyte complex to be used, polyethylene oxide and poly(methacrylic acid), will be profiled. Spray deposition of gold nanoparticles will also be studied. If successful, this process could possibly lead to rapid, scalable production of Bragg <b>reflectors</b> for cheaper, widespread use...|$|R
5|$|A {{wide range}} of concentrating {{technologies}} exists: among the best known are the parabolic trough, the compact linear Fresnel <b>reflector,</b> the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage. Thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24-hour electricity generation.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, rare Demon Fangs can {{be earned}} through combat {{which can be}} traded for additional, unique items that are {{beneficial}} in gameplay but not required to complete the game.

5|$|High {{altitude}} sections {{subject to}} {{snow and ice}} have yellow lane markings and red <b>reflector</b> posts (which are sometimes double or triple height); {{in contrast to the}} white lines and posts generally seen elsewhere around Australia. It is recommended that snow chains are carried for all two-wheel drive vehicles travelling on this highway within Kosciuszko National Park during the winter months.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, route <b>reflectors</b> and BGP confederations {{were not}} {{designed}} to ease BGP router configuration. Nevertheless, these are common tools for experienced BGP network architects. These tools may be combined, for example, as a hierarchy of route <b>reflectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Route <b>reflectors</b> and confederations both {{reduce the}} number of iBGP peers to each router and thus reduce {{processing}} overhead. Route <b>reflectors</b> are a pure performance-enhancing technique, while confederations also can be used to implement more fine-grained policy.|$|R
