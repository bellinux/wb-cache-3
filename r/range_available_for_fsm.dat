40|$|In a {{point contact}} NS junction, perfect Andreev {{reflection}} occurs over {{a range of}} voltages equal to the superconducting energy gap, producing an excess current of I_exc = (4 / 3) (2 eΔ/h). If the superconductor has a finite width, rather than the infinite width of the point contact, one cannot neglect superfluid flow inside the superconducting contact. The energy <b>range</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> perfect Andreev reflections then becomes larger than the superconducting gap, since superfluid flow alters the dispersion relation inside the finite width superconductor.

Measurements in this domain allow new searches for physics processes beyond the Standard Model (SM) at characteristic mass scales in the TeV range. The recent analyses were stimulated in part by an excess of events over the SM expectation for Q 2 ? 20000 GeV 2 reported in 1997 by the ZEUS [1] and H 1 [2] collaborations, for which electron-quark contact interactions (CI) have been suggested as possible explanations. 2. CONTACT INTERACTIONS Four-fermion contact interactions are an effective theory, which allows us to describe, in the most general way, possible low energy effects coming from "new physics" at much higher energy scales. This includes the possib...|$|R
