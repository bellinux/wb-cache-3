5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions <b>read</b> <b>like</b> they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E
5|$|I {{read this}} book, and I was totally stunned. At {{the same time}} I was pretty upset with myself that I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book <b>read</b> <b>like</b> Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E
5|$|James P. Cavanagh, {{a writer}} on the Alfred Hitchcock Presents {{television}} series, penned the original screenplay. Hitchcock felt the script dragged and <b>read</b> <b>like</b> a television short horror story, an assessment shared by an assistant. Though Stefano {{had worked on}} only one film before, Hitchcock agreed to meet with him; despite Stefano's inexperience, the meeting went well and he was hired.|$|E

5|$|The Tempest {{differs from}} Shakespeare's other plays in its {{observation}} of a stricter, more organised neoclassical style. The clearest indication {{of this is}} Shakespeare's respect for the three unities in the play: the Unities of Time, Place, and Action. Shakespeare's other plays rarely respected the three unities, taking place in separate locations miles apart and over several days or even years. The play's events unfold in real time before the audience, Prospero even declaring in the last act that everything has happened in, more or less, three hours. All action is unified into one basic plot: Prospero's struggle to regain his dukedom; it is also confined to one place, a fictional island, which many scholars agree {{is meant to be}} located in the Mediterranean Sea. Another reading suggests that it takes place in the New World, as some parts <b>read</b> <b>like</b> records of English and Spanish conquest in the Americas. Still others argue that the Island can represent any land that has been colonised.|$|E

25|$|A special word is {{warranted}} about the large murals Sadequain painted, which are {{spread all over}} the subcontinent. His murals depict man's struggle, his achievements and persistent thirst to discover his endless potential.

25|$|Calderone {{testified in}} {{numerous}} trials, among {{others in the}} Maxi Trial appeals and in the trial against Giulio Andreotti. In 1992 he published a book with Antimafia sociologist Pino Arlacchi about his life in Cosa Nostra, that was translated in many languages. These memoirs <b>read</b> <b>like</b> a handbook for understanding Cosa Nostra {{and the life of}} a mafioso.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1916, Hobens was {{employed}} in the golf department {{on the top floor}} of Wanamaker's store in New York. John D.

25|$|Forsyth eschews {{psychological}} {{complexity in}} favour of meticulous plotting around real-world institutions and laws, based on detailed factual research. His books are full {{of information about the}} technical details of such subjects as money laundering, gun running and identity theft. His novels <b>read</b> <b>like</b> investigative journalism in fictional guise. His moral vision is a harsh one: the world is made up of predators and prey, and only the strong survive.|$|E

25|$|Tuten's first novel, The Adventures of Mao on the Long March (1971), a fictionalized {{account of}} Chairman Mao's rise to power, is highly {{experimental}} in nature. It contains Faulkneresque changes in narrative and lengthy fictional conversations with Mao that <b>read</b> <b>like</b> journalistic interviews. The story {{first appeared in}} 1969 in a 39-page condensed form in the magazine Artist Slain. The novel in its entirety was subsequently published by Citadel Press in 1971, and re-released in 2005 by New Directions.|$|E
25|$|By 1996, MindVox {{was at the}} {{absolute}} height of its powers, yet it was disintegrating. Bruce Fancher was suddenly part {{of two or three}} other start-ups, system repairs that should have taken hours, dragged on for weeks.

25|$|There {{are also}} a few poems in Purananuru, which are {{classified}} as attruppatais. Attruppatai poems <b>read</b> <b>like</b> travelogues in which poets who were returning with gifts, received from a king, encourage other poets {{to do the same}} by describing the glory of the king and his country. This gives an opportunity to the poet, among other topics, to describe in great detail the natural beauty, fertility, and resources of the territory that has to be traversed to reach the palace of the patron.|$|E
25|$|Pier Angeli talked {{only once}} about the {{relationship}} in her later life in an interview, giving vivid descriptions of romantic meetings at the beach. Dean biographer John Howlett said these <b>read</b> <b>like</b> wishful fantasies, as Bast claims them to be. Joe Hyams, in his 1992 biography of Dean, claims that he visited Dean just as Angeli, then married to Damone, was leaving his home. Dean was crying and allegedly told Hyams she was pregnant, with Hyams concluding that Dean believed the child might be his.|$|E
25|$|After hearing oral {{arguments}} in the case, the Supreme Court was conflicted as to the outcome. The papers of Justice Thurgood Marshall, released nearly a decade later, reveal {{that a majority of}} justices were initially inclined to affirm the Ninth Circuit. Justice Harry Blackmun was assigned to write a majority opinion to that effect, while Justice John Paul Stevens drafted a dissenting opinion. Sensing that some members of the Court might be persuaded to change their votes, Stevens wrote a dissent that <b>read</b> <b>like</b> a majority opinion, and could be changed to one with the substitution of a few words.|$|E

25|$|<b>Read,</b> <b>like</b> {{most other}} people in Delaware, {{was very much in}} favor of trying to {{reconcile}} differences with Great Britain. He opposed the Stamp Act and similar measures of Parliament but supported anti-importation measures and dignified protests. He was quite reluctant to pursue the option of outright independence. Nevertheless, from 1764, he led the Delaware Committee of Correspondence and was elected to serve along with the more radical McKean and Rodney in the First and Second Continental Congress from 1774 to 1777. He was frequently absent, and when the Congress voted on American Independence on July 2, 1776, Read surprised many by voting against it. That meant that Rodney had to ride overnight to Philadelphia to break the deadlock in Delaware's delegation for independence. However, when the Declaration of Independence was finally adopted, Read signed it despite his natural caution.|$|E
25|$|The clocks at CERN and LNGS {{had to be}} in sync, and {{for this}} the {{researchers}} used high-quality GPS receivers, backed up with atomic clocks, at both places. This system timestamped both the proton pulse and the detected neutrinos to a claimed accuracy of 2.3nanoseconds. But the timestamp could not be <b>read</b> <b>like</b> a clock. At CERN, the GPS signal came only to a receiver at a central control room, and had to be routed with cables and electronics to the computer in the neutrino-beam control room which recorded the proton pulse measurement (Fig.3). The delay of this equipment was 10,085nanoseconds and this value had {{to be added to the}} time stamp. The data from the transducer arrived at the computer with a 580nanoseconds delay, and this value had to be subtracted from the time stamp. To get all the corrections right, physicists had to measure exact lengths of the cables and the latencies of the electronic devices. On the detector side, neutrinos were detected by the charge they induced, not by the light they generated, and this involved cables and electronics as part of the timing chain. Fig.4 shows the corrections applied on the OPERA detector side.|$|E
