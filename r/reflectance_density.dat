Controlling the refractive index of glass is important to develop a photosensitive paste for photolithographic process. We studied the refractive index and the structural transition of these glasses by measuring the refractive index, <b>reflectance,</b> <b>density</b> and dielectric constant with changing the SiO 2 /B 2 O 3 ratio in the SiO 2 -B 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 glass system. The refractive index was investigated to the relationship between the thermal and optical properties depending on the composition. It suggests that the thermal and optical properties in borosilicate glasses should be correlated to the glass structure with the SiO 2 /B 2 O 3 ratio...|$|E

Ponderosa pine in central New Mexico was chosen for study. Peroxide bleaching {{was used as a}} pretreatment to remove extraneous color and still yield usable wood for image analysis. The cores were bleached in 3 % peroxide raised to pH 12 and heated to 60 ° C, and then they were soaked in 95 % ethanol and rinsed in water. The cores were dried slowly to avoid checking or cracking. This treatment removed heartwood color while leaving the wood reasonably sound. Wood reflectance and latewood width were measured using reflected-light image analysis. For dendroclimatic modeling, best-subsets regression was used to determine the strongest predictive model, which was May-September rainfall using latewood reflectance and latewood width. The ability to dendroclimatically model and reconstruct summer precipitation is contingent on having latewood <b>reflectance</b> (<b>density)</b> measurements, and reconstructing summer precipitation in the Southwest will enhance paleoclimatology of the region. Image analysis with reflected white light is thus closer to being more widely applicable in dendrochronology...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{positive}} transparencies for photogravure {{intaglio printing}} and negative transparencies for platinum and carbon-tissue transfer printing were produced from photographic film, providing continuous tone images of great detail, tonality and delicacy. Some {{of the finest}} photographic images {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century were printed using these processes and over the last decade an increasing number of artists have been attracted to the expressive possibilities of these techniques. Choice of film stock for the production of the necessary transparencies has become much more limited over recent years and digitally produced negatives and positives from image-setters and ink-jet printers are increasingly favoured. The production of transparencies of a modest quality using ink-jet printers and commercially available acetate film is not difficult. However, comprehensive calibration routines are necessary if full control over tonal gradation and print contrast is to be secured, especially in the highlight and shadow areas. Each type of photosensitive coating/process responds differently to the type and spectrum emissions of ultra-violet lamp used for exposure and to the nature of the transparency substrate and the colour/composition of the ink-jet printer inks. The ink colour and UV absorbance of the negative transparency, or positive in the case of photogravure, can be varied to give enhanced control over <b>reflectance</b> <b>density,</b> tonal gradation and micro-contrast in the final print. This illustrated talk will compare different techniques for the production of and calibration of ink-jet transparencies and the requirements for control of tonal gradation and contrast in respect of platinum, photogravure, carbon transfer and other photographic contact printing processes. The talk is complemented by a conference exhibition of some of Peter Moseley’s photogravure portraits...|$|E

It is a tedious {{process that has}} to be repeated for every halftone dot or algorithm to be used. A new calibration procedure will be described that uses a halftoneindependent characterization ofthe printer and a pixel overlap model to predict the tone response of any halftone algorithm. This enables all halftone dots and algorithms to be calibrated with only one set of printer measurements. 1. ThTRODUCTION Halftone calibration, as it is currently implemented, involves printing and measuring test patches at several different gray levels for a given halftone dot or algorithm. These <b>reflectance</b> or <b>density</b> measurements describe the tone reproduction ofthe halftone dot or algorithm.

The formation of Si nanoribbons on Ag(110) is accompanied by a missing-row reconstruction of the Ag surface, and the removed Ag atoms form additional islands.

The first stage reconstructs a coarse model {{with the help}} of a template model for human figures. A non-rigid dense correspondence algorithm is applied to generate denser correspondences than traditional feature descriptors. We fit the template model to the point cloud reconstructed from dense correspondences while enclosing it with the visual hull. In the second stage, the coarse model from the first stage is refined with geometric details, such as wrinkles, reconstructed from shading information. To successfully extract shading information for a surface with nonuniform <b>reflectance,</b> a hierarchical <b>density</b> based clustering algorithm is adapted to obtain high-quality pixel clusters. Geometric details reconstructed using our new shading extraction method exhibit superior quality.

40|$|Two main {{alternating}} facies {{were observed}} at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1165, drilled in 3357 m water depth into the Wild Drift (Cooperation Sea, Antarctica) : a dark gray, laminated, terrigenous one (interpreted as muddy contourites) and a greenish, homogeneous, biogenic and coarse fraction-bearing one (interpreted as hemipelagic deposits with ice rafted debris [IRD]). These two cyclically alternating facies reflect orbitally driven changes (Milankovitch periodicities) recorded in spectral <b>reflectance,</b> bulk <b>density,</b> and magnetic susceptibility data and opal content changes. Superimposed on these short-term variations, significant uphole changes in average sedimentation rates, total clay content, IRD amount, and mineral composition were interpreted {{to represent the}} long-term lower to upper Miocene transition from a temperate climate to a cold-climate glaciation. The analysis of the short-term variations (interpreted to reflect ice sheet expansions controlled by 41 -k. y. insolation changes) requires a quite closely spaced sampled record like that provided by the archive multisensor track. Among those, cycles are best described by spectral reflectance data and, in particular, by a parameter calculated as {{the ratio of the}} reflectivity in the green color band and the average reflectivity (gray). In this data report a numerical evaluation of spectral reflectance data was performed and substantiated by correlation with core photos to provide an objective description of the color variations within Site 1165 sediments. The resulting color description provides a reference to categorize the available samples in terms of facies and, hence, a framework for further analyses.

It {{is believed that}} carbon nanotube forest (CNTF) films are the blackest materials to have been examined. Several studies have investigated their reflectance and absorption but resulting data has variability. Mizuno et al. has reported that single-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) forests provide a nearly constant reflectance and transmittance over a wide spectral range from UV (200 nm) to far IR (200 2 ̆ 7 m) on silicon oxide[1] while Arcos et al. have shown an increasing reflectance and transmittance over the near IR spectral region.

In this presentation, I will discuss our integrating sphere study of total reflectance and transmittance of CNT forests of different heights and densities on different substrates (quartz, Al/Si, Nb/Si).

The following paper summarizes the major findings of the research and {{it was published in}} 2004 Bushland Agricultural Day (Summer Crop Field Day) Proceedings (p. 88 - 98). Abstract: This work was carried out to investigate the relationship between remotely sensed data and aphid density in field conditions. A hyperspectral ground spectrometer was used to collect percent reflectance data over 0. 25 m 2 aphid stressed and non-stressed wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plots in the fields located in Texas, Oklahoma, and Colorado. Bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi Linnaeus), greenbug (Schizaphis graminum Rondani), and Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia) were counted in each of the 0. 25 m 2 aphid stressed wheat plots. Paired t-test indicated that percent reflectance values in the 400 - 900 nm region of the spectrum from aphid stressed and non-stressed wheat were statistically significant. In addition to the statistical comparison of percent reflectance, a total of 25 spectral vegetation indices were calculated from the reflectance data and regressed against the number of aphids. A wide array of relationships was found between spectral <b>reflectance</b> and aphid <b>density.</b> For example, the R 2 values were 0. 85 for greenbug plus bird cherry-oat aphid and 0. 97 for Russian wheat aphid.

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of information regarding the processes {{that occurred during the}} accretion of the early planetesimals is still present among the small bodies of our solar system. A review of our current knowledge of the density of small bodies is presented here. Intrinsic physical properties of small bodies are sought by searching for relationships between the dynamical and taxonomic classes, size, and density. Mass and volume estimates for 287 small bodies are collected from the literature. The accuracy and biases affecting the methods used to estimate these quantities are discussed and best-estimates are strictly selected. Bulk densities are subsequently computed and compared with meteorite density, allowing to estimate the macroporosity within these bodies. Dwarf-planets apparently have no macroporosity, while smaller bodies can have large voids. This trend is apparently correlated with size: C and S-complex asteroids tends to have larger density with increasing diameter. The average density of each Bus-DeMeo taxonomic classes is computed. S-complex asteroids are more dense on average than those in the C-complex that in turn have a larger macroporosity, although both complexes partly overlap. Within the C-complex, B-types stand out in albedo, <b>reflectance</b> spectra, and <b>density,</b> indicating a unique composition. Asteroids in the X-complex span a wide range of densities, suggesting that many compositions are included in the complex. Comets and TNOs have high macroporosity and low density, supporting the current models of internal structures made of icy aggregates. The number of density estimates sky-rocketed during last decade from a handful to 287, but only a third of the estimates are more precise than 20 %.

40|$|The {{physics of}} blackbodies {{has been an}} ongoing source of fascination and {{scientific}} research for over a hundred years. Kirchhoff's law states that emissivity and absorptivity are equal for an object in thermal equilibrium. Coupled with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, one can show that no object can emit more than a blackbody at any given frequency, direction or polarization. While this provides a theoretical maximum to the intensity of thermal emission from an object, few come even close {{to the level of}} emission exhibited by a blackbody. Thus, there is much room for research into enhancing thermal radiation from many different types of materials. The ability to modify or tailor the thermal emission profile of an object is of great importance and interest in many areas of applied physics and engineering. It turns out that thermal emission spectra can be changed by altering the geometry of the system or the materials used. For instance, nanoscale patterning can enhance emission at certain frequencies, while point defects can localize light at microcavities. General periodic electromagnetic structures, also known as photonic crystals, are therefore a natural medium in which to carry out such investigations, since they are metallodielectric systems that lend themselves relatively easily to sub-wavelength scale patterning and design. (cont.) This research program aims to study, through both theoretical and computational means, physical phenomena that drive thermal emission in photonic crystals and the design of point defects in the presence of fabrication constraints. First, we explore point defect geometries in inverted opal photonic crystals that can be fabricated by colloidal self-assembly. We identify and study substitutional point defects that introduce a usable defect band into the photonic band gap. It is found that a silica sphere of radius between 0. 33 a and 0. 35 a (where a is the lattice constant) introduces a triply degenerate state into the band gap. <b>Reflectance</b> and local <b>density</b> of states calculations are performed to verify the existence and frequency of this defect. Such a defect {{can be used as a}} microcavity for localizing light at a point, with a quality factor Q that is limited primarily by the proximity of the defect to the surface of the photonic crystal and other such defects. Second, we present a useful framework within which we can understand some of the physical phenomena that drive thermal emission in one- and two-dimensionally periodic metallic photonic crystals, emphasizing phenomenology and physical intuition. We find that polarization and periodicity play key roles in determining the types of physical phenomena that can be excited in these systems. (cont.) Promising structures in both 1 D and 2 D systems are identified as good candidates for thermal design. We discuss how the emissive properties of these systems can be tailored to our needs. Third, we establish that the significant enhancement of thermal emission via Q-matching, which has been possible in 1 D systems only, can be extended to 2 D systems by means of Fano resonances in the 2 D system. We demonstrate through detailed numerical and analytical studies that the Fano resonances characteristic of 2 D-periodic photonic crystal slabs can be understood in terms of a 1 D-model, thereby showing the existence of essentially 1 D behavior in a 2 D system. Moreover, we show how properties of these spectra can be controlled by changing the geometrical parameters of the photonic crystals. This work provides a path to the creation of graybodies that have tailored thermal emission spectra, with highly anomalous behavior. Fourth, we perform direct thermal emission calculations for 2 D- and 3 D-periodic photonic crystal slabs using stochastic electrodynamics following the Langevin approach, implemented via an FDTD algorithm. (cont.) We demonstrate that emissivity and absorptivity are equal, and thereby numerically verify Kirchhoff's law, by showing that such photonic crystal systems emit as much radiation as they absorb, for every frequency, up to statistical fluctuations. This has been an issue of great controversy because of experimental work indicating the violation of Kirchhoff's law. We also study the effect of surface termination on absorption and emission spectra from these systems. by David Lik Chin Chan. Thesis (Ph. D.)
