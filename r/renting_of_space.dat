The contribution {{of this paper is to}} present a radically alternative way of charging for storage services. In place <b>of</b> <b>renting</b> some amount <b>of</b> <b>space</b> for some period of time, systems like Mnemosyne allow more exible billing models closer to those proposed for network bandwidth, includ-ing versions of congestion pricing.

40|$|In {{the market}} <b>of</b> <b>rented</b> house, {{it is well}} known that the housing supply for {{standard}} families is few to the demand, and the reason is explined as follows. House <b>rent</b> <b>of</b> unit floor <b>space</b> and total floor <b>space</b> <b>of</b> housing unit are in inverce proportion. Under this condition, it is difficult to promote the supply <b>of</b> affordable <b>rented</b> house in local cites where the house rent stndard is low. In this paper, the possibility of faaordable rental housing supply for standard families is analyzed by simulation model of profit or loss. In residential zone, the possibility is high by the housing loan from official bank. In commercial zone, the possibility is low only by the official loan and the subsidy to constructive cost and interest on the loan is necessary. Analysis shows that the ratio of subsidy to interest on the loan is about four percent to gain a profit like as the practical management type in Yamaguchi Pre...|$|R
