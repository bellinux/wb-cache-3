5|$|A dwarf, in the Dungeons & Dragons (D) fantasy roleplaying game, is a {{humanoid}} race, one of {{the primary}} races available for player characters. The idea for the D dwarf comes from European mythologies and J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), and has been used in D and its predecessor Chainmail since the early 1970s. Variations from the standard dwarf archetype of a short and stout demihuman are commonly called subraces, of which {{there are more than a}} dozen across many different <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> and campaign settings.|$|E
5|$|As with zoneinfo, a user of Microsoft Windows configures DST by {{specifying the}} name of a location, and the {{operating}} system then consults a table of <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> that must be updated when DST rules change. Procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release. Updates are not issued for older versions of Microsoft Windows. Windows Vista supports at most two start and end rules per time zone setting. In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both 1987–2006 and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps. Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone, so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 time stamps.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, MMA had {{a number}} of {{different}} <b>rule</b> <b>sets,</b> with each one differing in ruling on downward elbow strikes (12-6 elbows). In UFC 1, the first UFC event where there were very few rules, Kevin Rosier used 12-6 elbows on Zane Frazier. In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were drawn up {{to try to make the}} sport more mainstream. The meeting consisted of representatives of a number of major MMA organisations including Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Pride Fighting Championships and International Fighting Championships (IFC) as well as doctors and referees in New Jersey, United States. In the meeting, doctors raised concerns about 12-6 elbows after seeing an IFC match where 12-6 elbows were used to the back of a fighter's head. One doctor argued that they could be life-threatening, and refused to sanction any set of rules that didn't prohibit them.|$|E

Event specific rules may be created for events like the Paralympic Games. One set of rules was created in 1994 and were specified in the IPC Handbook. This was used to govern IPC-sanctioned events like the Paralympic Games for many years. Competition rules for classes use rules set by or modified from rules created by the International Ski Federation (ISF). These rules were set at the 42nd International Ski Conference in 2000. The two <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> worked in concert with each other, with the ISF rules specifying the rules for alpine skiing, and the IPC providing modifications for para-alpine skiing. The IPC Alpine Sports Assembly Executive Committee can determine if skiers are eligible to compete in IPC sanctioned events at their own discretion regardless of what the rules say. National Paralympic Committees can have their own <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> at national competitions.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts {{were written}} with the {{intention}} of making the sport of MMA appear more acceptable in a wider society. Under those rules, soccer kicks were explicitly banned and classed as a foul defined as [...] "kicking the head of a grounded opponent". It is noted that while soccer kicks to grounded opponents are fouls, axe kicks, downward strikes with the back of the heel, are not considered fouls if done to any part of a grounded opponent. In the years after the banning of soccer kicks under the Unified Rules, a number of fans and MMA fighters have argued for them to be permitted under the Unified Rules along with face and foot stomps. Their justification is that soccer kicks and foot stomps being disallowed hindered fighters who were used to using them under other MMA <b>rule</b> <b>sets.</b> Mauricio Rua, who mostly used soccer kicks to earn victories in Pride, argued that elbows caused more pain than soccer kicks and claimed that soccer kicks were safer than elbows. Rua also argued that elbows were more dangerous than soccer kicks and yet were allowed under the unified rules. Opponents of soccer kicks argued that they needed to be banned in order for the sport of MMA to move forward. They also argued that in the face of opposition to the sport from politicians such as John McCain, soccer kicks had to be banned {{in order to ensure that}} the sport was not viewed as illegal [...] "human cockfighting" [...] and could be sanctioned as legal in the United States by Athletic Commissions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Classification aims to map a data {{instance}} to its appropriate class (or label). In associative classification the mapping is done through an association rule with the consequent {{restricted to the}} class attribute. Eager associative classification algorithms build a single <b>rule</b> <b>set</b> during the training phase, and this <b>rule</b> <b>set</b> is used to classify all test instances. Lazy algorithms, however, do not build a <b>rule</b> <b>set</b> during the training phase, the <b>rule</b> <b>set</b> generation is delayed until a test instance is given. The choice between eager and lazy algorithms is not simple. Using a single <b>rule</b> <b>set</b> to perform all the predictions may {{not take advantage of}} specific characteristics of a test instance. On the other hand, building a specific <b>rule</b> <b>set</b> for each test instance may incur in excessive computational efforts. In this paper we propose new eager and lazy algorithms for associative classification. Also, we present heuristics and caching mechanisms to alleviate computational costs during lazy classification, and a new hybrid algorithm which combines characteristics of eager and lazy approaches. Finally, we also propose a multi-criteria rule selection technique which is motivated by the intuition that a single criterion cannot give a global picture of the rule (i. e., rules with high confidence but low support). We performed a systematic evaluation of the proposed approaches using real data from an important application: spam detection. 1...|$|R
