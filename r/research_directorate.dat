25|$|The body of {{scientific}} evidence concluding that GM foods are safe {{to eat and}} do not pose environmental risks is wide. Findings from the International Council of Scientists (2003) that analyzed a selection of approximately 50 science-based reviews concluded that “currently available genetically modified foods are safe to eat,” and “there {{is no evidence of}} any deleterious environmental effects having occurred from the trait/species combinations currently available.” The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) supported the same consensus a year later in addition to recommending the extension of biotechnology to the developing world. Similarly, the Royal Society (2003) and British Medical Association (2004) found no adverse health effects of consuming genetically modified foods. These findings supported the conclusions of earlier studies by the European Union <b>Research</b> <b>Directorate,</b> a compendium of 81 scientific studies conducted by more than 400 research teams did not show “any new risks to human health or the environment, beyond the usual uncertainties of conventional plant breeding.” Likewise, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Europe (OECD) and the Nuffield Council on Bioethics (1999) did not find that genetically modified foods posed a health risk.|$|E

Its mission was to “conduct applied research in the fields of nuclear weapons analysis, requirements and development, and to advise Air Force Special Weapons Center staff on nuclear research matters”. In 1953 the <b>Research</b> <b>Directorate</b> began a weapons data-indexing project and maintained a technical library for all data on USAF contributions to the atomic energy program. The <b>Research</b> <b>Directorate</b> essentially led the charge in USAF efforts to conduct special weapons testing for weapons survivability and vulnerability. It also provided the groundwork for USAF interest in directed energy and weapons.|$|E

5000|$|According to Country Reports 2007, {{women who}} wore headscarves and their {{supporters}} [...] "were disciplined or lost their jobs in the public sector" [...] (US 11 March 2008, Sec. 2.c). Human Rights Watch (HRW) reports that in late 2005, the Administrative Supreme Court ruled that a teacher was not eligible for a promotion in her school because she wore a headscarf outside of work (Jan. 2007). An immigration counsellor at the Embassy of Canada in Ankara stated in 27 April 2005 correspondence with the <b>Research</b> <b>Directorate</b> that public servants {{are not permitted to}} wear a headscarf while on duty, but headscarved women may be employed in the private sector. In 12 April 2005 correspondence sent to the <b>Research</b> <b>Directorate,</b> {{a professor of political science}} specializing in women's issues in Turkey at Bogazici University in Istanbul indicated that women who wear a headscarf [...] "could possibly be denied employment in private or government sectors." [...] Conversely, some municipalities with a more traditional constituency might attempt to hire specifically those women who wear a headscarf (Professor 12 April 2005). The professor did add, however, that headscarved women generally experience difficulty in obtaining positions as teachers, judges, lawyers, or doctors in the public service (ibid.). More recent or corroborating information on the headscarf ban in the public service could not be found among the sources consulted by the <b>Research</b> <b>Directorate.</b>|$|E
