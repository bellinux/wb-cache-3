The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ acces-sion number for the 16 S rRNA gene sequence of strain VP 6 T is AF 082749.

A group of four diverse rhizobial isolates and two soil isolates that are highly related to Ensifer adhaerens were characterized by a polyphasic approach.

Phylogenetically, Ensifer and Sinorhizobium form a single group in the 16 S rDNA dendrogram of the α-Proteobacteria, as well as in an analysis of partial recA gene sequences. They may therefore be regarded as a single genus. Because Sinorhizobium was proposed in 1988, according to the Bacteriological Code (1990 Revision) the older name, Ensifer, has priority.
