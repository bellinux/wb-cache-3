40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{demonstrate}} {{selection criteria}} for cochlear implant candidates {{as well as}} the outcome of quality of life (QoL) after cochlearimplant surgery. MATERIAL AND METHOD Retrospective review was performed of all cochlear implants at Wahidin Hospital. A total number of 5 cochlear implantations were performed during the period of April 2003 to April 2004. Inclusion criteria were established and the audiological criteria were then evaluated using the OAE, BERA and ASSR test. The etiology of severe sensory neural hearing loss was detected. The CT scan and MRI of the inner ear were studied in the different causes of deafness. RESULTS The main cause of deafness {{in the present study was}} suffering from pregnancy rubella. The second one was familial congenital deafness. MR imaging and CT scanning of the temporal bone were performed, cochlear nerve canal disorder & narrow iac, and left hypoplasia cochlear nerve. The CT scan studied in the rubella cases showed anatomical normal cochlea and the hereditary cause of deafness showed abnormal cochlea. The QoL post implantation was evaluated in regards to improvement in education and communication. Evaluation pasca implant three months, FFT 45 dB nHLThe Functional Auditory Skills Checklist performed every three months after CI. CONCLUSION Multi-channel cochlear implantation in severe profound hearing loss patients could improve the hearing in both normal and abnormal cochlea, congenital <b>rubella</b> <b>deafness</b> and the familial cause of deafness. The outcomes of the QoL after surgery were better in hearing detection, speech perception, school performance, communication and return to work...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{practice in}} newborn nurseries of screening asymptomatic small for gestational age (SGA) babies for TORCH infection has been evaluated. In a retrospective review, we found that, in 1979, in our nursery 23 (35 %) of the sixty-six SGA babies were investigated for TORCH infection. No asymptomatic baby was investigated adequately to exclude infection. The two proven cases of congenital infection were both apparent on other clinical grounds, and neither {{would have been}} detected by our routine serologic screening. A review of published information on asymptomatic TORCH infections showed that, {{in the absence of}} other clinical signs of infection, intrauterine growth retardation is an unusual manifestation. Clinical investigation of TORCH infection should be confined to those babies with other clinical evidence of infection. Editor’s Note: One of the reviewers of this article commented: &dquo;The authors make the point that SGA is not a feature of subctinical congenital infection except rarely (usually <b>rubella</b> with inapparent <b>deafness</b> or CNS damage which shows up later in life). Instead SGA is a feature of clinically apparent congenital infection so that laboratory documentation is usually based on a constellation o...|$|R
40|$|Research {{was carried}} out on various aspects of {{deafness}} in a West African population. A national survey of childhood deafness was completed to discover the incidence and causes of severe to profound hearing loss in The Republic of the Gambia. A large school screening campaign was conducted to determine the prevalence of middle ear disease in Gambian children. Smaller studies concerned the hearing loss among post-meningitis patients; the disease pattern of audiology clinic patients in both urban and rural areas; the degree of hearing loss associated with otitis media and the rubella serology {{of a group of}} Gambian women and children. It was found that meningitis was a major identifiable disease causing <b>deafness.</b> <b>Rubella</b> and measles, often causes of deafness in other tropical countries, {{did not seem to be}} of such importance in The Gambia. Familial factors also accounted for little of the childhood deafness as far as it was possible to tell. Chronic middle ear infections could give rise to considerable hearing loss but rarely led to the dangerous complications often seen in other tropical communities. Effective medical and audiological services for the deaf are difficult to implement in developing countries. A primarily preventive approach may prove to be the most rational way of helping the deaf in The Gambia. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background : Rubella is a {{contagious}} {{viral infection}} associated with rash. 10 - 15 &#x 0025; {{of women are}} susceptible to this infection in their childbearing years and the disease is usually transmitted to the developing fetus causing abortion or stillbirth or congenital Rubella syndrome (CRS). Sensorineural hearing loss {{is one of the}} most common abnormalities associated with CRS. Aims : The study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of <b>Rubella</b> induced congenital <b>deafness</b> in south India. Materials and Methods : The present study is carried out on 1076 hearing impaired children below 14 years of age to determine etiological factors for congenital hearing impairment. Various audiometric tests such as PTA, OAE and BERA were carried out to know the type and degree of hearing impairment. Development histories including the prenatal, perinatal and postnatal histories were collected using a standard questionnaire. Results : The results indicated very less percentage (1. 57 &#x 0025;) of cases with the history of maternal Rubella infection indicating a significant reduction of Rubella-induced deafness in the developing countries. Conclusions : The main reason behind the low percentage of children with rubella- induced hearing impairment may be due to appropriate immunization of mothers to the rubella infection during their child bearing years. The increasing awareness in the developing countries of this infection and its consequences is another important reason behind the low percentage of the affected population...|$|R
40|$|Rubella—sometimes called German measles—is a {{contagious}} disease {{caused by a}} virus. Unlike measles, rubella almost never causes serious illness or complications in infants and young children. However, rubella infection in pregnant women can cause unborn babies to have serious birth defects with devastating, life-long consequences, or even die before birth. Rubella in Children Children infected with the rubella virus sometimes have a mild rash. But it might be hard to know if a child has rubella, because {{up to half of}} people who have rubella may not have a rash or other symptoms. The rash usually starts on the face and then spreads to the neck, chest, arms, and legs, and it lasts for about 3 days. Swelling of the lymph nodes, particularly behind the ears or {{on the back of the}} neck, may occur before the rash breaks out. A child with rubella might also have a slight fever or other symptoms like a cold. In fact, rubella spreads through coughing or sneezing. What Are the Dangers of Rubella to Unborn Babies? Rubella infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, and birth defects. The danger is highest for women who get rubella during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Birth defects caused by <b>rubella</b> include <b>deafness,</b> cataracts, and heart defects. Babies also may have mental retardation. This group of health problems is called Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS). The last large U. S. epidemic of rubella was in 1962 through 1965. During those years, rubella caused about 11, 250 deaths of unborn babies and 2, 100 deaths of newborns. Approximately, 20, 000 babies were born with CRS, of these babies, 8, 000 were deaf, 3, 600 were deaf-blind, and 1, 800 were mentally retarded. “Today, families are still living with the health effects and painful memories of this epidemic, ” says Dr. Jane Seward of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “The devastating consequences of the rubella epidemic made it clear that a vaccine was needed, and before the end of the decade, a very safe and effective vaccine had been invented, tested, and licensed. ...|$|R
