40|$|Abstract — Present paper {{contains}} {{steady state}} thermal {{analysis of a}} three lobes root blower. We constructed and analysed a 3 D model of root blower. Using ANSYS we calculated the temperature distribution and heat flux as well as animate the heat flux over time. The purpose of this analysis {{is to determine the}} clearance or interference of the <b>rotor</b> <b>lobe</b> seals and the case. Minimizing this clearance under start-up and operating temperatures is crucial to supercharger performance. We will do this by performing thermal analysis of the supercharger. The results are generated by ANSYS Mechanical Toolbar...|$|E
40|$|Case StudyAn OFS (Oil Free Screw) {{compressor}} experienced problems {{meeting the}} API 619 3 rd Edition vibration level acceptance criteria during shop testing. Extensive testing identified the primary mechanism that increased the rotor vibration levels was {{high levels of}} dynamic pressure pulsations due to acoustic resonance. This presentation will identify the fundamentals of acoustic resonance and how these frequencies can {{be affected by the}} factors which define an acoustic system. An inherent characteristic of OFS compressor discharge flow is a pulsed flow defined by pocket or lobe passing frequency occurring when the discharge gas from the <b>rotor</b> <b>lobe</b> pocket passes into the discharge porting. Oil free screw compressors can experience high levels of vibration due to acoustic resonance coupling with high dynamic pressure pulsations generated by these positive displacement machines. When a screw compressor is not volumetrically matched and the gas MW, density or discharge pressure is high, the discharge dynamic pressure pulsations can be high...|$|E
40|$|An {{optimisation}} {{procedure for}} twin screw compressor design is described, {{which is based}} on an analytical algorithm for rotor profile generation combined with a differential model of the fluid flow and thermodynamic processes within the machine. Rotor profiles are generated from a rack which have both stronger female <b>rotor</b> <b>lobes</b> and higher displacement. Compressors thus designed have higher delivery rates and better efficiencies than those using more well known profiles. Some optimization issues of the rotor profile and compressor ports are discussed, using a 5 / 6 - 106 mm screw compressor to illustrate the results. It is shown that the optimum rotor profile, compressor speed, oil flow rate and inlet temperature may differ significantly when compressing different gases or vapours...|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to Roots blowers, screw compressors {{are made with}} different profiles on the two rotors: the male <b>rotor</b> has convex <b>lobes</b> which mesh with the concave cavities of the female rotor. Usually the male <b>rotor</b> has fewer <b>lobes</b> than the female rotor, so that it rotates faster. Originally, screw compressors were made with symmetrical rotor cavity profiles, but modern versions use asymmetrical rotors, with the exact rotor designs being the subject of patents.|$|R
40|$|Screw {{compressors}} are {{at present}} a widely used means of compressing air, process gas and refrigerants. Computer simulation programs, verified by experimental data and improved by {{recent advances in}} mathematical analysis, form {{a powerful tool for}} process analysis within these machines and hence for a comprehensive check of innovative suggestions and design optimisation. One consequence of this is that screw <b>rotors</b> <b>lobe</b> profiles have been developed {{over the past few years}} which lead to enhanced machine performance. Although efficient operation of screw compressors is mainly dependent on the rotor profile and clearance distribution, other components, such as housing ports, bearings, seals and the lubrication system must be designed to take full advantage of their potential if maximum performance gains are to be achieved. A review of the most recent achievements in application of innovative details into the screw compressor practice is given at the end of this paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of a Rotor-Casing Assembly is influenced more by the internal air leakages than by any other thermo-fluid aspect of its behaviour. The pressure difference driving the air along a leakage path varies periodically and does so {{in a manner that}} may not be the same for every leakage path. So the distribution of leakage through the various leakage paths within the machine is important for the improvement of its performance. The total volume of air leakage and the distribution of the leakage among the different paths depend on the rotor-rotor and rotor-casing clearances as well as the geometry of the rotors' lobes. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was carried out using the FLUENT. Geometry definition, mesh generation, boundary and flow conditions, and solver parameters have all been investigated as the part of the numerical analysis. This analysis was conducted for static rotors at different positions. The results indicate that the size of the clearances as well as the geometry of the rotors' lobes can {{have a significant effect on}} the total volume of the air leakage as well as the distribution of the leakage among the three main leakage paths. The results can be used to ascertain the proper levels of clearances to be used and the best <b>rotor</b> <b>lobes</b> geometry to be used for the practical reduction of air leakage...|$|R

5000|$|The twin-screw type {{supercharger}} is {{a positive}} displacement type device that operates by pushing air through a pair of meshing close-tolerance screws similar {{to a set of}} worm gears. Twin-screw superchargers are also known as Lysholm superchargers (or compressors) after their inventor, Alf Lysholm.Each rotor is radially symmetrical, but laterally asymmetric. By comparison, conventional [...] "Roots" [...] type blowers have either identical rotors (with straight rotors) or mirror-image rotors (with helixed rotors). The Whipple-manufactured male <b>rotor</b> has three <b>lobes,</b> the female five lobes. The Kenne-Bell male <b>rotor</b> has four <b>lobes,</b> the female six lobes. Females in some earlier designs had four. By comparison, Roots blowers always have the same number of <b>lobes</b> on both <b>rotors,</b> typically 2, 3 or 4.The working area is the inter-lobe volume between the male and female rotors. It’s larger at the intake end, and decreases {{along the length of the}} rotors until the exhaust port. This change in volume is the compression. The intake charge is drawn in at the end of the rotors in the large clearance between the male and female lobes. At the intake end the male lobe is much smaller than its female counterpart, but the relative sizes reverse proportions along the lengths of both rotors (the male becomes larger and the female smaller) until (tangential to the discharge port) the clearance space between each pair of lobes is much smaller. This reduction in volume causes compression of the charge before being presented to the output manifold.|$|R
40|$|Unbalance {{response}} and stability analyses of a flexible <b>rotor</b> on three <b>lobe</b> journal bearings on flexible supports are presented. The {{influence of the}} support structure {{was included in the}} analyses using polynomial transfer functions. These transfer functions were extracted from measured dynamic compliance data of the support structure, measured at the bearing locations. Numerical predictions using polynomial transfer functions and single mass supports are compared to the experimental data. Predictions using the transfer function representation of the support structure show a clear improvement over the predictions using single mass supports without over-complicating the problem. The predicted critical speeds are within 2. 9 % of the measured critical speeds. The predicted stability threshold agrees with the measured stability threshold within 1 %. The effects of cross talk between supports and cross coupling between horizontal and vertical directions are investigated. The cross talk between supports was found to have a strong influence in the results while the influence of cross coupling between the vertical and horizontal directions is negligible...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} twenty years the Centre for Positive Displacement Compressor Technology, at City University, has {{employed}} experimental techniques for the measurement of screw compressors’ performance where both experimental data and predicted mathematical models are found to be in agreement with each other. Some of the experimental measuring techniques involve the use of pressure and temperature transducers installed in the housing to determine the vital thermodynamic process characteristics and functioning performance of compressors. Moreover, as advanced technologies were available, measurements were performed in an optical compressor with a transparent window near the discharge port to allow the application of a laser technique, Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), to investigate the axial mean flow and turbulence characteristics inside the working chamber of the male rotor. Recently a prototype two-phase screw steam expander has been designed and developed as a means of power recovery from liquid geothermal brine. An experimental setup has been designed by using a set of new generation instruments to complement the unit’s numerical modeling, from which predictions of an adiabatic efficiency in the order of 70 %, were obtained. The testing includes measurements of instantaneous pressure and temperature in the suction and discharge port, instantaneous torque, speed and flow rate as well as monitoring the temperature and pressure of its lubrication system. Furthermore, four miniature high resolution pressure transducers were installed in the expander unit to measure the main <b>rotor</b> inter <b>lobe</b> temporal pressures with respect to crank angle of the main rotor. The high dynamic characteristics and response of the instrument are captured by a real time processor, National Instrument Compact-RIO, data logger and the programming is done using LabVIEW. The paper presents the measuring method, preparation of the instruments, acquisition and processing of the results obtained during experimental investigation of the two-phase screw expander...|$|R
40|$|Rotary volume {{displacing}} {{mechanisms are}} widely used as oil pumps, air compressors, and the Wankel rotary engine. Although some of these mechanisms appear to be widely different they are {{of the family of}} 2 ̆ 2 gerotors 2 ̆ 2 and have the same basic mathematical shape generation relationships. Rotary volume displacing mechanisms classified as gerotors have lobes or teeth on the two working surfaces with all lobes in continuous contact. The number of lobes on the working surfaces differ by one, e. g. the Wankel rotary engine has three <b>lobes</b> on the <b>rotor</b> and two <b>lobes</b> on the housing. ^ The result of this study is the presentation of the analytical methods for determining the maximum theoretical flow rate and compression ratio for a given gerotor. The study covered the effect of the number of lobes on the generating gear, radius of the generating arc, gear on which the generating arc is located and the r p/r 2 ratio (where r p/r 2 = the distance {{from the center of the}} generating arc to the center of the gear to which it is attached divided by the radius of the larger pitch circle), in relationship to the maximum theoretical flow rate and compression ratio. ^ It is hoped that this work will contribute to the advancement of gerotor design and will encourage others to continue the work. ^ The author also hopes the invention and presentation of the Doublerotor will stimulate designers in their use of gerotors. ...|$|R
