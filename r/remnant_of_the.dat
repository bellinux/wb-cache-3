5|$|It {{has been}} argued {{variously}} that the Eskaya are a <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original indigenous settlers on Bohol; that they migrated to Bohol from Sumatra {{in the seventh century}} A.D.; that they are descendants of the resistance groups that fought under Francisco Dagohoy; that they are a cult or secret society; or that they are a conscious reconstruction of an imagined pre-colonial society.|$|E

5|$|The Himalia {{group is}} spread over barely 1.4Gm in semi-major axes, 1.6° in {{inclination}} (27.5±0.8°), and eccentricities between 0.11 and 0.25. It {{has been suggested}} that the group could be a <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> break-up of an asteroid from the asteroid belt.|$|E
5|$|The <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IRT Ninth Avenue Line at 155th Street would {{connect with}} the IRT Lenox Avenue Line, giving riders of the Jerome Avenue Line service to Manhattan's West Side.

5|$|Third Reich {{authorities}} {{disapproved of}} {{his choice of}} a Catholic marriage ceremony, performed by Klawitter. Klawitter had been barred from membership in the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Culture Chamber) and was considered politically unreliable after a 1936 breach of the Pulpit Law, a <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1870s Kulturkampf that among other religions barred Catholics from criticizing the state from the pulpit.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common clinically significant congenital disorder of the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E

5|$|Caversham has no {{secondary}} schools, {{although it}} does contain two primary schools and a special needs school. Caversham Primary School, {{at the corner of}} South Road and Surrey Street, has been at its present site since 1921. The school dates back to the early 1860s, and has a current enrollment of around 80 pupils. The school's two-storey 1920s brick buildings were pulled down and replaced in 1961, because of their structural unsoundness. The school's main gate– the only surviving <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier structure– is the suburb's war memorial.|$|E
5|$|G. Washington {{coffee was}} {{discontinued}} as a brand by 1961, when Washington's New Jersey plant {{was sold to}} Tenco, by then a division of The Coca-Cola Company. The last <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brand survives in G. Washington's Seasoning & Broth, a sideline developed in 1938. This brand was sold by American Home Products in 2000, and, after passing {{through a couple of}} intermediaries, has been run by Homestat Farm, Ltd. since 2001.|$|E
5|$|High on {{the eastern}} flank of Mount Rainier is a peak known as Little Tahoma Peak, , an eroded <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier, much higher, Mount Rainier.

5|$|In 1859, six guns, four 12-pounders and two 12-pound carronades, were {{installed}} on the bastion, and four years later, five 32-pounders were mounted on the fortification. The earliest defences of {{the southern end of}} the city of Gibraltar included the 16th century Charles V Wall, Flat Bastion, South Bastion, Southport Gate, and Southport Ditch. The complex of defences also included Southport Ditch which was depicted in the 1627 map of Gibraltar by Spanish engineer Luis Bravo de Acuña. On that map which is held by the British Museum, the ditch is shown as a Fosso south of Southport Gate. It was a large trench which extended from the southwestern aspect of the 16th century South Bastion to the Flat Bastion at Prince Edward's Gate. The width of the ditch is now indicated by that of Ragged Staff Gates, which initially served as a water gate. By the late 19th century, the ditch was utilised as an ordnance depot, with a magazine constructed in the 1880s. However, by the early 20th century, that same magazine was used as a pump house. After World War I and reclamation of land, the Ragged Staff Gates were opened to vehicular traffic. Gibraltar's Sunken Gardens, a 19th-century market garden, were a <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western portion of the Southport Ditch, and were filled in at the time of the 1967 Referendum Gate. Trafalgar Cemetery represents an eastern <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ditch.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, President Roosevelt first greatly {{expanded}} the reserve and then divided the reserve into four separate units, with Shoshone being the largest. Upon {{the creation of}} the U.S. Forest Service in 1905, the reserve was designated a National Forest, but the current wording and title were formulated forty years later in 1945. A <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest years of the forest management is the Wapiti Ranger Station which is located west of Cody, Wyoming. The station was built in 1903 and is the oldest surviving ranger station in any national forest, and is now designated a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|Several musical {{instruments}} have been found, including a trumpet, three violins and a viola da gamba, all expensive objects that probably belonged {{to either the}} officers or the trumpeters. One of the trumpeters on board {{was a member of}} the admiral's musical ensemble and it is assumed that one of the particularly fine, German-made instruments belonged to him. Another <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> officers' personal stores was discovered in 1997, consisting of a woven basket filled with tobacco and expensive imported foodstuffs and spices, including ginger, plums, grapes and cinnamon quills.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{released}} Croats apparently {{succeeded in}} travelling to the Slovene Littoral {{in the closing}} days of the war. They were then organised as a separate unit of the largely illusory <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia {{under the command of}} General Matija Parac, which was formally part of General Draža Mihailović's Chetniks. The unit was under the direct command of General Miodrag Damjanović. Later the unit retreated to British-occupied northern Italy.|$|E
5|$|The Sky Harbor Expressway {{was a small}} <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old {{northern}} {{alignment of}} Route 143. Beginning at Washington St., the former expressway headed south, under the Union Pacific Railroad, to an interchange with the airport entrance, before a bridge over the Salt River parallel to {{and just a few}} hundred feet away from the bridge on Route 143. The former expressway then ended at University Avenue with no further planned extension to Interstate 10.|$|E
5|$|The adipose fin, {{which is}} present in over 6,000 teleost species, is often thought to have evolved once in the lineage and to have been lost {{multiple}} times due to its limited function. A 2014 study challenges this idea and suggests that the adipose fin {{is an example of}} convergent evolution. In Characiformes, the adipose fin develops from an outgrowth after the reduction of the larval fin fold, while in Salmoniformes, the fin appears to be a <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fold.|$|E
