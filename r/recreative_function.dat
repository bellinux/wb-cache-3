40|$|There are {{distinguished}} here 11 {{units of}} vegetation and described their layer structure, floristic composition, habitat conditions and spatial relationships. The list of these units {{is presented in}} chapter 4. The paper describes in bigger detail the state of plant cover at the time this area was changing its functions from a productivity one into a protective and <b>recreative</b> <b>functions.</b> Forest phytocoenoses are considerably changed by the anthropopressure. The author has introduced an idea of anthropogenic convergence of phytocoenoses and focussed his attention on problems of succesion of secondary forest communities which prevail in this area (. for summary see page 468 - 470).

40|$|To {{pursue the}} usage of forests {{resources}} in the processes {{of economic and social}} development it is determining that the principles of natural heritage protection join in a concept of progress, based on evolution and technological innovation; the realization of innovative investigation and representation tools turns out to be useful to ease the integration of forests’ resources in shared development processes aimed at enhancing the cooperation of local actors, and to ease the territory’s sustainable growth and the development of the natural heritage. The integrated management of the actions aimed at protecting and easing the ecologic and <b>recreative</b> <b>functioning</b> of forests, which are increasingly exposed to pressures caused by several catastrophic factors, requires the tuning of modelling and active monitoring systems of the forests based on social networks and volunteering for the processes of data updating...|$|R
40|$|Apart {{from very}} {{contaminated}} spatial areas, {{there are places}} with attractive and non-polluted environment, that are suitable for tourism and recreation. Such places are spa resorts, characterized by numerous and various natural elements having significant health and <b>recreative</b> <b>functions</b> (thermo-mineral springs, rare gases, favorable climatic conditions, rich vegetation, etc.), which attract attention of ample tourist demand. Serbia is welknown as a 'country of spa resorts', because of {{a great number of}} thermo-mineral springs, long tradition and their significance for tourism economy. Official statistical service keeps records of tourist flows only at 30 spa resorts (approximately), having participation at 95 % of the total tourist trade in Serbia's spas. The topic of this paper is devoted to estimation of the present state and perspectives of spa tourism in Serbia. Special attention is focused on: analysis of resources for spa tourism, discussion of key factors for tourist valorization of Serbia's spas, investigation of structural features of spa tourism, comparison of Serbia's experiences in domain of spa tourism with contemporary trends in certain spa resorts in other European countries, and, finally, defining the most important tasks for spa tourism improvement...|$|R
