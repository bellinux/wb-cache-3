40|$|A sentential {{theory of}} attitudes holds that propositions (the things that agents believe and know) are {{sentences}} of a representation language. Given such a theory, {{it is natural}} {{to suggest that the}} proposition expressed by an utterance of natural language is also a sentence of a representation language. This leads to a straightforward account of the semantics of attitude verbs. However, this kind of theory encounters problems in dealing with indexicals: expressions such as &quot;L &quot; &quot;here,&quot; and &quot;now. &quot; It is hard to explain how an indexical in the scope of an attitude verb can be opaque. This paper suggests that while the propositions that agents believe and know are sentences, the propositions expressed by utterances are not sentences: they are singular propositions, of the type used in Kaplan's theory of direct <b>reference.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on recent work in situation semantics, this paper shows how such a theory can describe the semantics of attitude verbs and account for the opacity of indexicals in the scope of these verbs. 1...|$|E

40|$|The ethical {{concerns}} {{generated by}} transactions in human tissue touch on fundamental {{ideas of the}} body, society, {{and the nature of}} giving. These issues have generally been discussed using Euro-American terms of <b>reference.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on fieldwork carried out in Sri Lanka, this article describes the ways in which a distinctively Theravāda Buddhist notion of giving and charity has been linked to the development of strategies to encourage the donation of human tissue. Eye and blood donation are used as illustrations of the linkages that have been forged between religious duty, other-wordly aspirations, and nationalist sentiment in the development of national donation services. The key question which is then addressed is how these distinctive beliefs and values inform attempts to frame donations of sperm and ova which are now beginning to take place in Sri Lanka. In religious and cultural terms the candidacy of sperm and ova as gifts appears to be evaluated very differently. Explaining these differences opens up the possibility of a more thoroughgoing anthropological critique of bioethics and the manner of its diffusion both within and beyond the Euro-American context...|$|E
40|$|Barry Stroud sees global skepticism, {{in regard}} to our {{knowledge}} of the external world, {{as a threat to the}} claims of modern epistemology. An exchange between Susan Haack and Richard Rorty illustrates the situation of contemporary epistemology. For Michael Williams, the skeptic trades on presuppositions of traditional epistemology; we can avoid the skeptic by adopting contextualism. Williams is, in turn, countered by Ron Wilburn. Wilburn argues for a cross-contextual structure of second-order beliefs, a structure that would support the skeptic. An argument of G. E. Moore's leads to reflection on the contingency of the special authority we have over our beliefs about our experience. For Hilary Putnam, the skeptic trades on presuppositions in the theory of <b>reference.</b> <b>Drawing</b> an alternative account of reference from Ludwig Wittgenstein's work, Putnam refutes a standard skeptical thought-experiment. Putnam focuses on the contemporary version of this skeptical scenario, that describes a world made-up of brains in a vat. Jane McIntyre argues against Putnam's refutation.

Digital games often feature compelling visual interfaces that combine high usability with creative visual design. We explore selected examples of game interfaces in stereoscopic vision regarding their stereoscopic characteristics, how they draw attention, how we judge effect and comfort and where the interfaces fail. As a result, we propose a list of five aspects which should be considered when designing stereoscopic visual information: explicit information, implicit information, spatial <b>reference,</b> <b>drawing</b> attention, and vertical alignment.

Time-honored, traditional methods and media are described in tandem with innovative techniques developed and shared by contemporary astronomical sketchers. Explanations of what to expect visually from white light, Hydrogen-alpha and Calcium K filters are provided for those new to solar observing, along with essential tips on equipment, observing techniques and the practicalities of drawing at the eyepiece. For the technically minded, detailed descriptions are given {{on how to use}} image manipulation software to bring your sketches to life through animation.   The Sun is the most visually dynamic object in our solar system and offers compelling, spectacular views. Knotted magnetic field lines give rise to powerful eruptions and form the intricate sunspots and arching prominences that make our nearest star one of the most exciting, yet challenging, astronomical objects to sketch. Facilitated by the availability of affordable dedicated solar telescopes and filters, the Sun has become an increasingly popular target amongst astronomical sketchers. The use of narrowband solar filters provides a wonderful opportunity to capture views of the Sun that have, until recently, been largely inaccessible.   You’ll discover easy to follow, step-by-step instructions geared toward your specific interests, be it technical sketching and contributing to science, personal study, or even fun solar outreach activities that help children learn through art.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} nature of spatial {{integration}} in the East Midlands in the long eighteenth century, assessing {{the relative importance of}} different scales of interaction between people and institutions - from the most localised, intra-urban scale, to the county, regional and national scales. In contrast to the historiographical picture of the emergence of distinct, internally integrated regions in eighteenth-century England, the East Midlands was an ill-defined, incoherent space, within and across which multiple layers of spatial interaction co-existed. Whilst intra-regional interaction appears to have been dominant in regions such as the North West and West Midlands, in the East Midlands, both more localised and more extensive (extra-regional) connections were more common. The thesis adopts an explicitly spatial frame of <b>reference,</b> <b>drawing</b> on Lefebvre's ‘triad’, and thus being {{based on the premise that}} spaces were shaped by the conceptions of outsiders, the attitudes and perceptions of their inhabitants, and, most importantly, the practices of individuals within those spaces. Several types of spatial practice are considered, covering economic, social, political and cultural activity, and relating to a spectrum of social groups. The space-economy of the hosiery industry is reconstructed through an analysis of different factors of production, and {{the nature of}} the transport network with which these production processes were associated. The influence of the county - as both an administrative and socio-cultural reality and an imagined community - is also discussed. Patterns of migration and the socio-spatial features of will-making illustrate the spatial scales at which social and economic life most commonly operated in the East Midlands. Thus, the thesis demonstrates the complexity of regional development in this period, concluding that, in the East Midlands, the most localised scales of spatial interaction were of greater importance than the regional in structuring the lives of its inhabitants. This apparent lack of region-wide integration can be explained, firstly, by the unusual dominance of three county towns at the head of weak county urban networks, and secondly, by the persistence of a proto-industrial structure in the East Midlands' staple hosiery industry.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to present an {{algorithm}} for terrain matching, leveraging an existing fuzzy clustering algorithm, and modifying it to its supervised version, in order to apply the algorithm to georegistration and, later on pattern recognition. Georegistration is the process of adjusting one drawing or image to the geographic location of a "known good" <b>reference</b> <b>drawing,</b> image, surface or map, The georegistration problem can be treated as a pattern recognition problem; and it can be applied to the target detection problem. The terrain matching algorithm will be based on fuzzy set theory as a very accurate method to represent the imprecision of the real world, and presented as a multicriteria decision making problem. The energy emitted and reflected by the Earth's surface has to be recorded by relatively complex remote sensing devices that have spatial, spectral and geometrical resolution constraints. Errors usually slip into the data acquisition process. Therefore, it is necessary to preprocess the remotely sensed data, prior to analyzing it (image restoration, involving the correction of distortion, degradation and noise introduced during the rendering process). In this paper we shall assume that all these problems have been solved, focusing our study on the image classification of a corrected image being close enough, both geometrically and radiometrically, to the radiant energy characteristics of the target scene. In particular, at a first stage we consider each pixel individually; and a class will be assigned to each pixel, taking into account several values measured in separate spectral bands. Then we shall describe an automatic detection system based on a previous algorithm developed in A. Del Amo et al., introducing now the fuzzy partition model proposed by A. Del Amo et al. A first phase will lead to a spectral definition of patterns; and a second phase will lead to classification and recognition. Similarity measures will then allow us to evaluate the degree to which a pixel can be associated to each pattern, or determine if a pattern is similar enough to a subimage of the main image, to establish that a target we are looking for can be found on that image...|$|E

40|$|The {{history of}} American Catholic biblical {{scholarship}} {{is all but}} ignored, with only Gerald P. Fogarty 2 ̆ 7 s American Catholic Biblical Scholarship (1989) devoted to this subject. Most scholars assume that American Catholic exegesis was mired in an ahistorical, anti-critical mode prior to Divino Afflante Spiritu (1943), a papal encyclical which is called the 2 ̆ 2 Magna Carta 2 ̆ 2 of biblical scholarship because it encouraged the use of historical criticism. Further, it is supposed that the little exegesis which did appear was simply a derivative of European Catholic scholarship. Thus American Catholic biblical scholarship is seen as having little history worth recounting before Divino. This study argues that an in-depth engagement with the actual exegesis of American Catholic New Testament scholarship prior to Divino demonstrates that the above is a caricature. Instead, American Catholic NT scholarship was pluralistic and critical in this period. Using a publication proliferation scale {{as the basis for}} selecting the exegetes studied, it is shown that three separate approaches existed in American Catholic NT scholarship. These three approaches exhibit distinct alignments of various methodological, exegetical, and theological elements and can be classified as paradigms. These three paradigms correlate with specific social strategies adopted by Catholics as they confronted an environment dominated by Protestantism. American Catholic NT exegesis was heavily apologetical in reaction to Protestant scholarship, but it was not anti-critical. American Catholic NT scholarship, in particular, rejected the common Protestant understandings of the Kingdom of God as an eschatological or moral reality. Instead, American Catholic exegetes pictured Jesus 2 ̆ 7 fundamental work as the founding of an institution [...] the Church [...] which would continue his soteriological function. They especially explained Jesus 2 ̆ 7 parables on the kingdom as ecclesiological teaching. Jesus 2 ̆ 7 mission and message was fundamentally ecclesiological in the American Catholic frame of <b>reference.</b> <b>Drawing</b> heavily upon the agricultural images in the parables, this interpretation saw the Kingdom [...] and therefore of the Church [...] as an organic, unfolding institution. This reading necessitated the embrace of a developmental model of history. In this way, American Catholic NT scholarship was prepared for the directions outlined by Divino, as well as found a means by which to engage modern Protestant exegesis without abandoning core Catholic convictions...|$|E
