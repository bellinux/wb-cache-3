5|$|This {{series of}} {{successful}} British infantry and mounted operations {{resulted in the}} complete defeat of the 16,000 to 18,000 strong German, Austrian and Ottoman force, about half of whom were killed or wounded, and nearly 4,000 taken prisoner. Also captured were a mountain gun battery of four heavy guns, nine machine guns, a complete camel-pack machine gun company, 2,300 rifles and a million rounds of ammunition, two complete field hospitals with all instruments, fittings and drugs, while a great quantity of stores in the supply depot at Bir el Abd was destroyed. All the captured arms and equipment were made in Germany, and the camel-pack machine gun company's equipment had been especially designed for desert warfare. Many of the rifles were of the latest pattern and made of <b>rustless</b> steel. Murray estimated the total German and Ottoman casualties at about 9,000, while a German estimate put the loss at {{one third of the}} force (5,500 to 6,000), which seems low considering the number of prisoners.|$|E
500|$|In 1969 Barker {{was able}} to write, produce and star as General Futtock in the film Futtocks End which {{featured}} no dialogue and only [...] "grumble and grunt". The Ronnie Barker Playhouse had been designed to find a successful idea for a sitcom, and the episode [...] "Ah, There You Are" [...] by Alun Owen, which introduced the bumbling aristocratic character Lord <b>Rustless,</b> was chosen. The character returned for the 1969â€“1970 series Hark at Barker as the main character; Barker wrote for the show under the name Jonathan Cobbald. As Wiley he wrote the 1971 series Six Dates with Barker. Despite Barker's success on ITV, LWT's programme controller Stella Richman opted to fire Frost's company Paradine (Frost was sacked from the LWT board) and as Barker was contracted to the company rather than the network, he lost his job, as did Corbett.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, Barker, Corbett and Josephine Tewson {{performed}} a sketch about Henry VIII at the 1971 BAFTAs, with Barker playing Henry. The two {{also had to}} keep the audience entertained for eight or so minutes as the show was stopped because of technical difficulties. Their performance at the award show impressed the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton and Controller of BBC One Paul Fox, who {{were sitting in the}} audience. Not knowing they were both essentially unemployed, although still contracted to Paradine, Cotton signed the duo up for their own show together, and a series each on their own; he later joked he [...] "must have offered them too much money." [...] Barker and Corbett wished to avoid being remembered primarily as a duo, and felt they could not work {{in the same way as}} a conventional double act like Morecambe and Wise, and so each maintained their solo careers as well. They each were given a one-off variety special; Barker's, called The Ronnie Barker Yearbook, featured a sketch for each month of the year, although because of time constraints the first two had to be cut. Barker also reprised his character Lord <b>Rustless</b> in the sitcom His Lordship Entertains in 1972. Barker wrote all seven episodes, again with the pseudonym Jonathan Cobbald.|$|E
60|$|There seems {{hardly any}} one on board but ourselves: we {{alone on the}} little {{promenade}} deck. Strangely lonely, floating on a bare old ship past the great bare shores, on a rolling sea, stooping and rising in the wind. The wood of the fittings is all bare and weather-silvered, the cabin, the seats, even the little lions of the seats. The paint wore away long ago: and this timber will never see paint any more. Strange to put one's hand on the old oaken wood, so sea-fibred. Good old delicate-threaded oak: I swear it grew in England. And everything so carefully done, so solidly and everlastingly. I look at the lions, with the perfect-fitting oaken pins through their paws clinching them down, and their little mouths open. They are as solid {{as they were in}} Victorian days, as immovable. They will never wear away. What a joy in the careful, thorough, manly, everlasting work put into a ship: at least into this sixty-year-old vessel. Every bit of this old oak wood so sound, so beautiful: and the whole welded together with joints and wooden pins far more beautifully and livingly than iron welds. <b>Rustless,</b> life-born, living-tissued old wood: <b>rustless</b> as flesh is <b>rustless,</b> and happy-seeming as iron never can be. She rides so well, she takes the sea so beautifully, as a matter of course.|$|E
6000|$|Is {{not this}} a strange {{type in the}} very heart and height of these mysterious Alps--these {{wrinkled}} hills in their snowy, cold, grey-haired old age, at first so silent, then, as we keep quiet at their feet, muttering and whispering to us garrulously in broken and dreaming fits, as it were, about their childhood,--is it not a strange type of the things which [...] "out of weakness are made strong"? If one of these little flakes of mica sand, hurried in tremulous spangling {{along the bottom of}} the ancient river, too light to sink, too faint to float, almost too small for sight, could have had a mind given to it as it was at last borne down with its kindred dust into the abysses of the stream, and laid, (might it not have been thought?) for a hopeless eternity, in the dark ooze, the most despised, forgotten, and feeble of all earth's atoms; incapable of any use or change; not fit, down there in the diluvial darkness, so much as to help an earth wasp to build its nest, or feed the first fibre of a lichen; what would it have thought, had it been told that one day, knitted into a strength as of imperishable iron, <b>rustless</b> by the air, infusible by the flame, out of the substance of it, with its fellows, the axe of God should hew that Alpine tower?--that against it--poor, helpless mica flake!--the wild north winds should rage in vain; beneath it--low-fallen mica flake!--the snowy hills should lie bowed like flocks of sheep, and the kingdoms of the earth fade away in unregarded blue; and around it--weak, wave-drifted mica flake!--the great war of the firmament should burst in thunder and yet stir it not; and the fiery arrows and angry meteors of the night fall blunted back from it into the air; and all the stars in the clear heaven should light, one by one as they rose, new cressets upon the points of snow that fringed its abiding-place on the imperishable spire? ...|$|E
6000|$|As Madame Beck {{ruled by}} espionage, she of course had her staff of spies: she {{perfectly}} knew {{the quality of}} the tools she used, and while she would not scruple to handle the dirtiest for a dirty occasion--flinging this sort from her like refuse rind, after the orange has been duly squeezed--I have known her fastidious in seeking pure metal for clean uses; and when once a bloodless and <b>rustless</b> instrument was found, she was careful of the prize, keeping it in silk and cotton-wool. Yet, woe be to that man or woman who relied on her one inch beyond the point where it was her interest to be trustworthy: interest was the master-key of Madame's nature--the mainspring of her motives--the alpha and omega of her life. I have seen her feelings appealed to, and I have smiled in half-pity, half-scorn at the appellants. None ever gained her ear through that channel, or swayed her purpose by that means. On the contrary, to attempt to touch her heart was the surest way to rouse her antipathy, and to make of her a secret foe. It proved to her that she had no heart to be touched: it reminded her where she was impotent and dead. Never was the distinction between charity and mercy better exemplified than in her. While devoid of sympathy, she had a sufficiency of rational benevolence: she would give in the readiest manner to people she had never seen--rather, however, to classes than to individuals. [...] "Pour les pauvres," [...] she opened her purse freely--against the poor man, as a rule, she kept it closed. In philanthropic schemes for the benefit of society at large she took a cheerful part; no private sorrow touched her: no force or mass of suffering concentrated in one heart had power to pierce hers. Not the agony in Gethsemane, not the death on Calvary, could have wrung from her eyes one tear.|$|E

50|$|Barff is {{most widely}} remembered for his {{invention}} of {{a method of}} rust proofing cast iron, named after him. The method used superheated steam to form a layer of tri-iron tetroxide(Fe3O4), which proved much cheaper than traditional galvanisation. The method was subsequently improved by George Bower, after which the process {{became known as the}} Bower-Barff process. The Bower-Barff <b>Rustless</b> Iron Co. had works in Southwark and New York, the latter supplying cast-iron for many of the city's landmark buildings.|$|E
50|$|Jason {{appeared}} in variety shows {{in support of}} stars such as Dick Emery and his performances {{caught the attention of}} Ronnie Barker. Jason was recruited to appear in Hark at Barker (LWT, 1969), starring Barker as Lord <b>Rustless,</b> as Dithers, the hundred-year old gardener. There was also a sequel, His Lordship Entertains (1972) for the BBC. Jason played junior employee Granville in the first programme of the comedy anthology Seven of One (1973), called Open All Hours (BBC) and starring Barker as the miserly proprietor of a corner shop.|$|E
50|$|Each show {{began with}} a spoof news item read by Barker as a {{continuity}} announcer. He would then introduce {{the main part of}} the programme, a lecture to be given by Lord <b>Rustless</b> (also Barker) on a different topic each week from his stately home, Chrome Hall. Helped and hindered by Rustless' secretary (Mildred) Bates, his Butler Badger, his bad-tempered Cook, his incoherent gardener Dithers and (in Series 2) his buxom, near-mute maid Effie, these lectures invariably degenerated into farce, and were frequently interrupted by comic sketches on film or videotape which also starred Barker in various roles.|$|E

Barker wrote all seven episodes, again with the pseudonym Jonathan Cobbald.Their show together was The Two Ronnies, a sketch show which aired for twelve series and eight specials between 1971 and 1987, to immediate success. The show, as described by Anthony Hayward of The Independent, was [...] "a cocktail of comedy sketches, playlets, songs and parodies, a long-winded Corbett monologue and a singing star, sandwiched between the opening and closing news summaries." [...] The usual format consisted of many sketches between the two, an ongoing filmed serial, a solo character sketch from Barker, Corbett's monologue, a musical number, a special guest, bookended by joke news items, delivered from a desk by the two in the style of newsreaders, before ending with the catchphrase [...] "It's good night from me - and it's good night from him." [...] This was a set format which was used for almost the entirety of the show's run. The end catchphrase and newsreader characters were devised because Barker found it difficult to appear as himself: Corbett explained that Barker [...] "was a very private man, a quiet man ... He found it almost impossible to talk directly, as himself, to an audience." [...] Each also had their own solo segments to help ensure they were not totally associated as a double act. Filming took place over four months of each year. After outdoor and serial sketches were filmed on location, the studio material was filmed on Sunday evenings at BBC Television Centre in front a live audience; the musical finale was filmed the day before without the audience.|$|E

As coatings TiN, (Ti, Al) N, TiN-Al_ 2 O_ 3 -TiN multilayers, TiCN-based multilayers and diamond, and as the coating processes PVD, CVD and PCVD were applied. With all studied coatings the wear resistance has been essentially improved. At application of PVD the (Ti, Al) N layers achieved highest tool life cycles. In addition, the high potentials of novel PVD layer systems {{on the basis of}} zirconium and niobium have been demonstrated. Under the PCVD and CVD multilayer systems especially the Al_ 2 O_ 3 -containing systems were found to be highly wear resistant. The optimum of the layer thickness depends on the applied cutting process. For turning with smooth cuts a thickness of the coating layer of > 10 #mu#m is required.
