This study aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of mtDNA rearrangement events in AD brain tissue. Postmortem frozen human brain cerebral cortex samples were obtained from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation Program, Sun City, AZ. Mitochondria were isolated and direct sequence by using MiSeqÂ®, and analyzed by <b>relative</b> <b>software.</b> Three types of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) rearrangements have been seen in post mortem human brain tissue from patients with AD and age matched control. These observed rearrangements include a deletion, F-type rearrangement, and R-type rearrangement. We detected a high level of mtDNA rearrangement in brain tissue from cognitively normal subjects, as well as the patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The rate of rearrangements was calculated by dividing the number of positive rearrangements by the coverage depth. The rearrangement rate was significantly higher in AD brain tissue than in control brain tissue (17. 9 %versus 6. 7 %; p = 0. 0052). Of specific types of rearrangement, deletions were markedly increased in AD (9. 2 % versus 2. 3 %; p = 0. 0005).

40|$|Acrylonitrile (AN) {{is a major}} {{volatile}} {{waste generated}} {{in the production of}} acrylamide and often associated with aromatic contaminants (toluene and styrene) in plant effluents. We examined Rhodococcus rhodochrous DAP 96622 to determine if it could be adapted to efficient biodegradation of acrylonitrile (AN) in a bioreactor. A model bioreactor with granular activated carbon (GAC) as a substratum for Rhodococcus with AN as sole carbon or in combination with toluene was established. The kinetics of AN biodegradation by immobilized and planktonic cells were evaluated and compared. Inlet load and empty retention time were varied to test the removal efficiency in fed-batch and single-pass mode reactor. In addition, the three dimensional structure and characteristics of the biofilm were followed using confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) and <b>relative</b> <b>software.</b> Immobilized cells in the bioreactor, at starting concentrations of AN up to 1150 mg l- 1 in the presence of Tol, had at least 13 fold higher AN degradation rates than that seen of planktonic cells. A near steady state of AN degradation was maintained at 75 - 85 % for AN and 80 %- 90 % for Tol within the parameter of EBRT= 8 min and AN and Tol inlet loads between 50 - 200 mg l- 1 h- 1 and 200 - 500 mg l- 1 h- 1, respectively. However, when the inlet load of AN was increased to more than 200 mg l- 1 h- 1 and 500 mg l- 1 h- 1 for Tol, a reduction in efficiency of AN degradation was observed. Biofilms with discrete microcolonies interspersed with voids and channels were observed. Precise measurement of biofilm characteristics agreed with the assumption that the biomass and thickness of the biofilm increased along the carbon column depth. With a porous attachment material like GAC, substrate diffusion is most likely not a limiting factor for AN degradation. Rhodococcus rhodochrous DAP 96622 in a non-sterile activated charcoal column showed efficient degradation of AN in the presence of Tol. The Rhodococcus bioreactor may provide a potential practical waste gas and water treatment system...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} an ever-growing number of {{electronic}} devices embedded in cars, from those related to safety (e. g. ABS) to others concerning entertainment (smart-phone connections) or vehicle optional feature (e. g. GPS). This new scenario can lead to security issues: to address these problems Hardware Security Module (HSM) was developed. A HSM is a device that constitutes a secure environment where {{it is possible to}} perform cryptographic operations in an efficient way; one example of HSM for the automotive environment is the Secure Hardware Extension (SHE). It constitutes a valid solution for current automotive security needs, featuring a secure zone where to store cryptographic parameters and perform isolated and efficient security operations. In the automotive field there are strict requirements about latency and throughput, consider for instance air-bag or other safety related systems, and therefore any automotive HSM has to satisfy these requirements in order to be suitable for this kind of vehicle. Therefore, one of the main latency requirements of the SHE specifications is that any function shall be executed within 2 micro second. This work has focused on the implementation of a high-speed reliable interface for the interconnection between a device supporting SHE standard and the surrounding environment (such as a CPU) through extension of the hardware bus interface and development of the <b>relative</b> <b>software</b> drivers. The hardware bus used is the Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI), available in high and low performance versions. The former (AXI 4 -Lite) is simple to use and has a low resource footprint while the latter (AXI 4 -Full) provides a high throughput at the expense of a higher usage of logical resources. In order to find the best solution to fit our goal, different configuration of AXI 4 and SHE accelerator were explored, then software was developed. The software is arranged in three layers; the lower one reproduces the interface provided by the SHE specifications and satisfies the related latency requirement while the other two provide functions that can help the end user to interact with SHE despite this is paid in terms of execution time. In this way the trade-off between performance and usability is left to the end user. On one hand the software has been developed to fulfil the requirements stated by SHE specifications on the other hand to make it compatible with some features, that are execution in both bare-metal and embedded OS environment (Linux OS has been chosen in this work) and the ability to work with both polling and interrupt wait policies in each implemented version. The project space have been explored and different solutions have been implemented in order to find the best trade-off between performance and software flexibility and meet the SHE requirements. The solutions explored involve frequencies sweep of SHE and AXI 4 bus, in addition to the two previously mentioned software wait policies. All the solutions were tested on a Xilinx ZYNQ 7000 SoC that features an ARM Cortex-A 9 CPU, where the software has been run, and a Xilinx FPGA for hardware prototyping...|$|E
