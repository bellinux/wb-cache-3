5|$|Baeyertz {{was born}} as Emilia Louise Aronson on 29 March 1842 in Bangor, North Wales. Her family were wealthy {{orthodox}} Jews, {{and she was}} brought up to strict Jewish ideals. She attended school for a while but, {{by the time that}} she reached thirteen, her family removed her from formal education and she remained at home due to her ill health. Instead, she spent her time with her mother, who used to read Shakespeare to her, and would spend time in her family's library practising <b>reading</b> <b>aloud.</b>|$|E
5|$|No fasts or rituals {{to purify}} oneself before worship—typical of Hindu worship—are {{prescribed}} for Matangi worship. Anyone can use any mantra for worship, {{even though he}} is not initiated or considered unfit for worshipping any other deity. A thousand-name hymn from the Nanayavarta-tantra and a hundred-name hymn from the Rudradamala are dedicated to the goddess. The reciting of the Sanskrit alphabet, the chanting of mantras, the <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> of the scriptures, and performance of music and dance are also described as constituting acts of her worship.|$|E
5|$|Southern Min dialects undergo {{considerable}} tone sandhi, i.e. {{changes to}} the tone depending on {{the position of the}} syllable in any given sentence or utterance. However, like pinyin for Mandarin Chinese, POJ always marks the citation tone (i.e. the original, pre-sandhi tone) rather than the tone which is actually spoken. This means that when <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> the reader must adjust the tone markings on the page to account for sandhi. Some textbooks for learners of Southern Min mark both the citation tone and the sandhi tone to assist the learner.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{determine}} how interactive <b>read</b> <b>alouds</b> effect student comprehension with the claim being that they increase comprehension scores. Through the use of observation, interviews, questionnaires, and comprehension questions, data was collected. When given questions after three <b>read</b> <b>alouds</b> and three independent readings, student comprehension scores were higher following the <b>read</b> <b>alouds</b> for below average and average readers. There was no difference in scores for the above average readers. The implications of this study include using <b>read</b> <b>alouds</b> as a support in intermediate grades, average and below average readers preferring <b>read</b> <b>alouds</b> to independent <b>reading,</b> and using interactive <b>read</b> <b>alouds</b> to help engage students and enhance the discussion of text...|$|R

5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} by House of Anansi Press and released in October 2010 as Coupland began the Massey lecture series in Vancouver on October 12. Each lecture consisted of Coupland <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> one chapter, followed by questions from the audience and a book signing. The second lecture took place in Regina on October 14, followed by Charlottetown on October 19, Ottawa on October 25, and ending on October 29 in Toronto. The series was recorded then aired on CBC Radio One's Ideas between November 8 and 12. The book was long-listed for the Scotiabank Giller Prize.|$|E
5|$|Although Tenebrae was an Italian production, most of {{the cast}} spoke their {{dialogue}} in English to increase the film's chances of success in United States. For domestic audiences, the film was dubbed into Italian. The English-language dub retained Franciosa's, Saxon's and Steiner's natural voices. However, Nicolodi's voice was dubbed by Theresa Russell, Giuliano Gemma's was dubbed by David Graham, and {{most of the}} female voices were dubbed by Adrienne Posta. Michele Soavi – frequent Argento collaborator, second assistant director on Tenebrae and later a noted director in his own right – acted alongside Robin's in the second flashback scene. Another of Argento's collaborators, Fulvio Mingozzi cameoed as a hotel porter. In common with several other Argento films, close-ups of the killer's gloved hands were Argento's own. In the film's Italian-language dub, Argento also provided the opening voice-over, <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> descriptions of murderous actions from Neal's fictitious novel, Tenebrae.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Mavis starts dating {{the equally}} shy Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield), {{but it remains}} platonic. Jerry dies {{of a heart attack}} in 1975 before being able to express his romantic intentions. She meets {{salesman}} Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) the following year. They date, but the relationship is strained by Derek's interfering mother, who believes that Mavis is not good enough for her son. The relationship remains non-committal until 1983, when another man competes for Mavis's hand, the artistic Victor Pendlebury (Christopher Coll). Mavis is torn as she likes both but chooses Derek in the end. On their wedding day in 1984 Mavis has second thoughts about marrying Derek and jilts him at the altar. Her guilt turns to indignation when she learns that Derek– feeling the same way she does– did not attend the ceremony either. Derek goes on to an unhappy marriage with Angela Hawthorne (Diane Fletcher), but in 1986 he begins wooing Mavis again, realizing he made a mistake when he let her go. Mavis eventually decides Derek is the man for her and the couple marry in September 1988. The other residents of Coronation Street consider Mavis and Derek something of a joke, but neither care as they are genuinely in love. They spend evenings <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> to each other and discussing the events of the day. They remain happy despite the occasional problem, but their happiness is cut short in 1997 when Derek dies suddenly of a heart attack after a road rage incident. Devastated, at his funeral Mavis chastises those who mocked her marriage over the years.|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: In two {{experiments}} short-term forgetting {{was investigated}} in a short-term cued recall task designed to examine proactive interference effects. Mixed modality study lists were tested at varying retention intervals using verbal and non-verbal distractor activities. When an interfering foil was <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> and a target item read silently, strong PI effects were observed for both types of distractor activity. When the target was <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> and followed by a verbal distractor activity, weak PI effects emerged. However, when a target item was <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> and non-verbal distractor activity filled the retention interval, performance was immune {{to the effects of}} PI for at least eight seconds. The results indicate that phonological representations of items <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> still influence performance after 15 seconds of distractor activity...|$|R

The control group was given a treatment with three phases technique while experimental group was given a treatment with interactive <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> technique. The instruments used in this research were reading comprehension test given for both groups experimental and control groups and questionnaires given to experimental group. To answer first research problem, the data from reading test were analyzed using t test. The results shows there were significance difference between the mean of experimental group posttest score and control group score whereas mean of experimental group posttest higher than the mean control group posttest. It means {{that the use of}} interactive <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> was effective improving students’ reading ability. The second research problem was answered by the data from questionnaires.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} which effect preschool teachers believe that <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> has on children’s literacy development. To gain knowledge about this I have interviewed and observed currently working preschool teachers at two preschools in Västra Götalands län. As guidance, I have used a designed interview guide which encouraged the preschool teachers to openminded answers. In relation to those I’ve also carried out unstructured observations during <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> occasions. The material was analysed out of the sociocultural perspective. The outcome of this has concluded that preschool teachers claims that <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> should be given more space in preschools as it is developing the language but also, that the interest itself is a key to development. The result shows at the same time that <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> is bound socially and that children needs to be challenged in their reading to be able to move forward. But it also shows that the connection between <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> and children’s reading-, language- and writing development is hard for preschool teachers to connect. ...|$|R

25|$|A fifteenth century, 2,346-line couplet {{version of}} the tale, called The Lyfe of Ipomydon, is found in MS Harley 2252 and also in two printed copies by Wynkyn de Worde, one of them incomplete.

25|$|The calligraphic {{poetry in}} the first half was mainly {{constructed}} of kanji of varying sizes, hiragana and katakana characters, that were placed on pages with special emphasis on the spatiality that they created, being close to an experiment in visual poetry.

25|$|A two-year {{cycle of}} Readings was provided, to which {{thematic}} titles were given. These proved not very hardwearing - {{they did not}} always adequately reflect the readings and were considered too narrow in their scope; It {{was not long before}} priests, if not parishioners, noticed that in spite of the huge increase in the amount of Scripture heard - there were now three readings, Old Testament, New Testament and Gospel, much was missed out. When the <b>reading</b> <b>aloud</b> of the Bible at home and Scripture as the basis of Religious Education were the rule, this may not have mattered; people's general knowledge of the Bible was broader. Now that both had disappeared it did. Moreover, the readings jumped from book to book week by week following the themes. It was not therefore possible to follow the thought of a particular biblical writer, something that was noted by the Liturgical Commission and was corrected in the ASBs successor, Common Worship. The book was also the high point of Tractarian influence: apart from retaining something of the Four Action Shape of Gregory Dix, there were set lections for the Blessing of An Abbot, for Those Taking Vows and for Vocations to Religious Communities. These were to disappear in 2000. The same applied to the Saints who would no longer be distinguished as to whether they were Martyrs, Teachers or Confessors. There was a good range of Prefaces to the Eucharistic Prayers, including one for St. Michael and All Angels (for which festival there is now no such provision).|$|E
