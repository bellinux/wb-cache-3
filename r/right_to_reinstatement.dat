Thirteen pro-union workers were fired from the call center. One fired worker, David Neel, proved to a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) agent and a federal judge that his union activism {{was a factor in}} his firing. The federal judge ordered the Fund to reinstate Neel at his job. The Fund appealed the decision to the NLRB's five-member board in Washington, D.C. The Fund's appeal was denied, and the Fund was ordered to pay Neel $19,088 of backpay and interest, plus $7,000 for waiving his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reinstatement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Amnesty Law, {{organized}} into five chapters (which was considered highly satisfactory by {{the victims of}} political persecution) guarantees the following amnesty rights: the declaration {{of the status of}} political amnesty recipient; financial reparations; assurance, for all official purposes, that the period of time in which they were forced to stop their professional activities due to punishment or threat of punishment will count as valid; the conclusion of courses interrupted due to punishment or the validation of diplomas obtained by those who completed courses at teaching institutes outside the country; and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reinstatement</b> for punished civil servants and public employees. In the sole paragraph of article 1, the law guarantees those who were removed from their jobs by administrative cases, based on emergency legislation, without the right to contest the case or defend themselves, and prevented from knowing the motives and grounds for the decision, reinstatement to their positions (due to the age of the claimants, this reinstatement has occurred, in practice, in retirement). The law also lists in detail all the punishments that entitle victims to the status of recipients of political amnesty, and it states that financial reparations, provided for in chapter III, may be paid in two different ways: in a single installment, consisting of the payment of 30 times the minimum monthly wage per year of punishment for those who cannot prove an employment relationship, and whose value may not, under any circumstances, exceed 100,000 reais or in permanent and continuous monthly installments, guaranteed to those who can prove an employment relationship. According to the law, each victim of political persecution has the right to receive the outstanding amounts up until five years before the date of their request claiming amnesty.|$|E

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{impact of the}} 2008 crisis on the Italian economy led to policy responses including structural reforms and labour market liberalisation to reverse the worrisome output and employment trends. A key action by the Italian government, the evocatively named Jobs Act of 2014, has deeply changed Italian industrial relations. The Jobs Act has introduced a new contract type that substantially limits workers’ <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>reinstatement</b> in case of fi rms invalidly fi ring them.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} the issue of preferential <b>rights</b> in relation <b>to</b> the increased practice of hiring temporary staff. The object is illuminated from a diversity perspective by seeing what a circumvention of the preferential rights may have consequences for vulnerable groups on the Swedish labor market.   The question of preferential <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>reinstatement</b> is controlled in  The Employment Protection Act. The preferential right is for the protection of workers made redundant due to redundancy. The use of agency workers has increased significantly in the Swedish labor market since the industry's legalization in 1993. This has created some problems in terms of preferential <b>rights.</b>   <b>To</b> a circumvention of the law, shall exist requires that the measures constitute circumvention is justified, measures should have been sought to circumvent the law and been unfair in view of the particular case. Hiring of staff is not considered as a new employment, which is the requirement <b>to</b> invoke preferential <b>rights,</b> thus causing it to staff hiring is legitimate action under the preferential time.   To reduce the abuse of the right of priority, I believe that the application of law should be changed so that it takes into account the triangular available on today's labor market...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{offers an}} {{assessment}} of whistleblower protection in countries throughout Europe. The assessment is made against a 'three-tiered model' derived from the UK Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA). Although the sole stated purpose of the UK PIDA {{is to protect the}} whistleblower, I argue that the successive recipient tiers make previous tiers accountable for investigating and dealing with suspected wrongdoing, thereby serving other purposes than mere protection. As protection often takes the form of creating a ground to claim compensation for the retaliation suffered - and not, for example, granting the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reinstatement</b> - these secondary purposes should not be underestimated...|$|E
40|$|The {{usage of}} {{temporary}} work agencies services is increasing in the Swedish labour market {{and it has}} also caused some problems. There have been cases where employers have been accused to circumvent the preferential <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reinstatement</b> by using temporary agency workers rather than rehire preference eligible employees during labour need. The purpose of this thesis is to describe, analyse and enhance {{the understanding of the}} preferential rights to reinstatement and study when hiring of temporary agency workers, during the period when there is preference eligible former employees, is permitted. The method being used in this thesis has been applied with particular attention to the directives, laws, legislative history and doctrine. The preferential rights to reinstatement in 25 - 27 §§ of the Employment Protection Act is a protection which states that the employer has to hire employees or former dismissed employees during increased labour needs. The purpose of this right is that an employer should not be able to terminate an employee due to redundancy and then later hire new employees. An employee is entitled to the preferential right as he/she meets the criteria of the Employment Protection Act. An increased labour need does not guarantee preference eligible workers a reinstatement. The employee must be qualified for the position. In order for an employer's action to be considered as circumvention of the preferential rights, requires that the action claiming to be circumventing is substantiated, was meant to avoid the preferential right and been unfair considering the circumstances of the individual case. The preferential right can only be applied in hiring situations. The usage of temporary agency workers is not included in the concept of hiring new employees and is therefore a permitted action during the preferential rights period. A law change should take place since the preferential right no longer fulfils its purpose...|$|E

2500|$|Many of the Supreme Court's post-Mackay {{decisions}} involved {{balancing the}} rights of strikebreakers and those who crossed the picket line against {{the rights of}} striking workers. This was a logical outcome of the Mackay Radio decision, for the Mackay Court had asserted that strikers remained employees. But the Mackay Court never addressed {{the legal status of}} strikebreakers, which it now began to do. [...] In Belknap, Inc. v. Hale, 463 U.S. 491 (1983), the Court held that strikebreakers who were offered permanent employment and then replaced to make room for returning strikers could seek relief in state court for breach of contract and misrepresentation. The Court also began to address the status of union members who crossed picket lines. [...] The Court upheld a union's ability to fine members who crossed picket lines and held that replaced strikers are entitled <b>to</b> <b>reinstatement</b> if the employer expands its workforce after a strike. However, the Supreme Court held that a union may not compel an employer to fire union members who cross a picket line. And in NLRB v. Granite State Joint Board, 409 U.S. 213 (1972), the Supreme Court held that a union member who crosses a picket line can avoid union sanctions by simply resigning from the union. Upholding the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> freedom of association, the Court also held that unions may not constitutionally prohibit members from resigning in order to avoid sanctions for crossing picket lines. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> work, the Court said, even protected an employer's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> entice striking workers back to work with promises of promotions or better pay.|$|R
