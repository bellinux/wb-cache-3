5|$|In American football, passing, {{along with}} running (also {{referred}} to as rushing), {{is one of the}} two main methods of advancing the ball down the field. Passes are typically attempted by the quarterback, but any offensive player can attempt a pass provided they are behind the line of scrimmage. To qualify as a passing play, the ball must have initially moved forward after leaving the hands of the passer; if the ball initially moved laterally or backwards, the play would instead be considered a running play. A player who catches a forward pass is a receiver, and the number of receiving yards each player has recorded in each season is a recorded stat in football games. In addition to the overall National Football League (NFL) receiving champion, league <b>record</b> <b>books</b> recognize statistics from the American Football League (AFL), which operated from 1960 to 1969 before being absorbed into the NFL in 1970, Although league <b>record</b> <b>books</b> do not recognize stats from the All-America Football Conference, another league that merged with the NFL, these statistics are recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

40|$|Aims: Home glucose {{testing and}} {{reflection}} on patterns are {{important elements of}} type 1 diabetes self-management. We hypothesised that patients who demonstrated evidence of self-testing by bringing a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> (capillary blood glucose monitoring diary) to clinic would have better glycaemic control than patients with a glucometer alone, or neither <b>record</b> <b>book</b> nor glucometer. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of 233 consecutive type 1 diabetes patients using basal-bolus insulin. Exclusion criteria were diagnosis of type 1 diabetes within the previous year, current pregnancy, or prior inclusion in this study. We recorded {{the presence or absence}} of a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer at the clinic, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c), and previous structured education attendance. Results: Of 233 patients, 90 brought a <b>record</b> <b>book,</b> 61 brought a glucometer and 82 brought neither. Mean HbA 1 c did not differ between patients with a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> (63 ± 2 mmol/mol [7. 9 ± 0. 2 %]) or glucometer (63 ± 2 mmol/mol [7. 9 ± 0. 2 %]), but was higher in those with neither (77 ± 2 mmol/mol [9. 2 ± 0. 2 %]; p< 0. 001). Patients bringing a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> were older on average than those with a glucometer or neither (49. 6 ± 1. 7 vs. 41. 2 ± 1. 7 vs. 40. 6 ± 1. 4 years; p< 0. 001) and had longer mean duration of diabetes (27. 9 ± 2. 0 vs. 19. 2 ± 1. 7 vs. 18. 7 ± 1. 6 years; p< 0. 001). Prior structured education did not predict the presence of a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer in the clinic. Conclusions: Evidence of self-testing at clinic review, either as a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer, was associated with improved control compared with those with neither. HbA 1 c did not differ between patients bringing a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer. Self-reflection on glucose results is important for type 1 diabetes self-management, irrespective of the recording method used...|$|R

5|$|The first Olympic men's javelin throw contest {{was held}} in 1908 and a women's {{competition}} was introduced in 1932. The first javelins were made of various types of wood, but in the 1950s, former athlete Bud Held introduced a hollow javelin, then a metal javelin, both of which increased throwers performances. Another former athlete, Miklós Németh invented the rough-tailed javelin and throws reached in excess of 100m – edging towards the limits of stadia. The distances and {{the increasing number of}} horizontal landings led the IAAF to redesign the men's javelin to reduce distance and increase the implement's downward pitching moment to allow for easier measurement. Rough-tailed designs were banned in 1991 and all marks achieved with such javelins were removed from the <b>record</b> <b>books.</b> The women's javelin underwent a similar redesign in 1999. The current javelin specifications are 2.6 to 2.7m in length and 800grams in weight for men, and 2.2 to 2.3m and 600g for women.|$|E
