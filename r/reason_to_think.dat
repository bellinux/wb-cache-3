5|$|Keith (Enrico Colantoni) is {{visited by}} Mindy O’Dell (Jamie Ray Newman), who {{tells him to}} {{investigate}} Dean O’Dell’s (Ed Begley, Jr.) death. Mac (Tina Majorino) is called in for tech support when an animal research lab is raided and a valuable monkey is stolen, and Mac asks Veronica for help. The researchers believe that a PETA-like organization, named PHAT, is responsible. At the PHAT meeting, Mac flirts with the group leader, Bronson, {{but there is no}} <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that they’re guilty. Weevil invites Keith to investigate Dean O’Dell’s office, and he finds a 40-year-old bottle of scotch unopened. At the next PHAT meeting, Veronica is asked to take action for animal rights in any way she sees fit. Keith presents the bottle of scotch as evidence of a murder of Dean O’Dell. Back at the lab, Veronica notices a coworker being mean to the monkey researchers. After a slight hazing ritual, Veronica and Mac are accepted into the group. In order to impress the leader of the group, Veronica, Mac, and Parker (Julie Gonzalo) participate in a party.|$|E
25|$|The Greek text of this codex is a {{representative}} of the Byzantine text-type. The non-Byzantine readings are confirmed by Codex Monacensis and minuscule 1071, though there is no real <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> they are related.|$|E
25|$|The Menezes family {{condemned}} the shooting and rejected the apology. His grandmother {{said there was}} 'no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> he was a terrorist'. Although it was initially {{reported that they were}} offered almost £585,000 compensation, the Menezes family eventually received £100,000 in compensation from the Metropolitan Police.|$|E

40|$|For {{free will}} theorists, {{the problem of}} luck has been a {{constant}} source of consternation. Peter van Inwagen presents a version immune to even agent-causal conceptions of free will. However, van Inwagen’s version of the problem can be avoided if there are true propositions taking the form of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom. There are good <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that there are, and no comparably good <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that there are not. This defense is also resistant to common attacks based on foreknowledge and the grounding of the truth of these counterfactuals...|$|R

25|$|While {{the murderer}} of Patrick's {{assistant}} {{was killed and}} immediately sent to heaven because he was forgiven by Patrick, future murderers were to be pardoned as Patrick would not be around to assure their forgiveness and ascent to heaven. There is, however, no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the events described actually occurred although they do provide insight into how the Brehons thought about their own law.|$|E
25|$|However, {{with the}} {{technological}} advances, {{the government has}} received the ability to invade privacy in more subtle ways; further, there is no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that the rate of}} such technological advances will slow down. “Can it be that the Constitution affords no protection against such invasions of individual security?”, Brandeis asks. He answers that a clear negative answer is evident in Boyd v. United States.|$|E
25|$|Gage sent Rogers to Montreal {{to stand}} trial but, once there, Rogers was among friends of Amherst. Due to Amherst's influence, Rogers was acquitted of all charges and the verdict was sent to King George III for approval. The king approved, but could not call Gage a liar openly. Instead, he made a note that there was <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> Rogers might have been treasonous.|$|E
5000|$|Thus, {{there are}} <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Cantor's {{infinite}} {{hierarchy of the}} infinites is superfluous.

50|$|In section three, he {{affirms that}} {{not only does he}} not think there are good reasons for believing that all {{material}} objects were created by God, but neither does common sense give <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that God exists at all or that there is an afterlife.|$|R
40|$|Are {{torture and}} torturers unforgivable? The article {{examines}} {{this question in}} the light of a Humean account of forgiveness. Initially, the Humean account appears to suggest that torturers are unforgivable. However, in the end, I argue it provides us with good <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that even torturers may be forgiven...|$|R
25|$|Captain Turner gave {{evidence}} in Britain and now gave a more spirited defence of his actions. He argued that {{up until the}} time of the sinking he had no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that zig-zagging in a fast ship would help. Indeed, that he had since commanded another ship which was sunk while zig-zagging. His position was supported by evidence from other captains, who said that prior to the sinking of the Lusitania no merchant ships zig-zagged. Turner had argued that maintaining a steady course for 30minutes was necessary to take a four-point bearing and precisely confirm the ship's position, but on this point he received less support, with other captains arguing a two-point bearing could have been taken in five minutes and would have been sufficiently accurate.|$|E
25|$|In 1324, Odoric of Pordenone, a Franciscan missionary from Friuli, Italy, is {{believed}} {{by some to}} have celebrated a Catholic Mass and baptized natives at Bolinao, Pangasinan. In July 2007, memorial markers were set up in Bolinao to commemorate Odoric's journey based on a publication by Luigi Malamocco, an Italian priest from Friuli, Italy, who claimed that Odoric of Perdenone held the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines in Bolinao, Pangasinan. That 1324 mass would have predated the mass held in 1521 by Ferdinand Magellan, which is generally regarded as the first mass in the Philippines, by some 197 years. However, historian William Henry Scott concluded after examining Oderic's writings about his travels that he likely never set foot on Philippine soil and, if he did, there is no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that he celebrated mass.|$|E
25|$|August Weismann was {{responsible}} for interpreting and formalizing the mechanisms of Darwinian evolution in a modern theoretical framework. In 1889, he theorized that ageing was part of life's program because the old need to remove themselves from the theatre {{to make room for}} the next generation, sustaining the turnover that is necessary for evolution. This theory again has much intuitive appeal, but it suffers from having a teleological or goal-driven explanation. In other words, a purpose for ageing has been identified, but not a mechanism by which that purpose could be achieved. Ageing may have this advantage for the long-term health of the community; but that doesn't explain how individuals would acquire the genes that make them get old and die, or why individuals that had ageing genes would be more successful than other individuals lacking such genes. (In fact, there is every <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the opposite is true: ageing decreases individual fitness.) Weismann later abandoned his theory.|$|E

No; his wife had been by no means so certain as she had pretended to be.

50|$|Semiclassical {{approaches}} to incorporating quantum effects into general relativity seem {{to show that}} the chronology protection conjecture postulated by physicist Stephen Hawking fails to prevent the formation of such rings, although Matt Visser feels that there are <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> the semiclassical approach is unreliable here, and that a full theory of quantum gravity will likely uphold chronology protection.|$|R
25|$|The {{evidence}} available thus {{seems to}} indicate that the Indians of Robeson County who have been called Croatan and Cherokee are descended mainly from certain Siouan tribes of which the most prominent were the Cheraw and Keyauwee, but they probably included as well remnants of the Eno, and Shakori, and very likely some of the coastal groups such as the Waccamaw and Cape Fears. It is not improbable that a few families or small groups of Algonquian or Iroquoian may have cast their lot with this body of people, but contributions from such sources are relatively insignificant. Although there is some <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the Keyauwee tribe actually contributed more blood to the Robeson County Indians than any other, the name is not widely known, whereas that of the Cheraw has been familiar to historians, geographers and ethnologists {{in one form or another}} since the time of De Soto and has a firm position in the cartography of the region. The Cheraws, too, seem to have taken a leading part in opposing the colonists during and immediately after the Yamasee uprising. Therefore, if the name of any tribe is to be used in connection with this body of six or eight thousand people, that of the Cheraw would, in my opinion, be most appropriate.|$|E
25|$|If cross-effects {{that result}} in {{diffusive}} transfer of internal energy were also labeled as heat transfers, they would sometimes violate the rule that pure heat transfer occurs only down a temperature gradient, never up one. They would also contradict the principle that all heat transfer is of {{one and the same}} kind, a principle founded on the idea of heat conduction between closed systems. One might to try to think narrowly of heat flux driven purely by temperature gradient as a conceptual component of diffusive internal energy flux, in the thermodynamic view, the concept resting specifically on careful calculations based on detailed knowledge of the processes and being indirectly assessed. In these circumstances, if perchance it happens that no transfer of matter is actualized, and there are no cross-effects, then the thermodynamic concept and the mechanical concept coincide, as if one were dealing with closed systems. But when there is transfer of matter, the exact laws by which temperature gradient drives diffusive flux of internal energy, rather than being exactly knowable, mostly need to be assumed, and in many cases are practically unverifiable. Consequently, when there is transfer of matter, the calculation of the pure 'heat flux' component of the diffusive flux of internal energy rests on practically unverifiable assumptions. This is a <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of heat as a specialized concept that relates primarily and precisely to closed systems, and applicable only in a very restricted way to open systems.|$|E
500|$|The medieval {{churches of}} St Nicholas, Blakeney and St Margaret's, Cley, and the now ruined Blakeney friary, {{were not the}} first {{religious}} buildings in the area. An early church was recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book at Esnuterle ("Snitterley" [...] was a former name for Blakeney, the current name first appearing in 1340), but the 11th-century church's location is unknown, {{and there is no}} <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that it is {{on the site of the}} 'chapel'.|$|E

50|$|The {{unfinished}} symphony {{may have}} been intended for a Wellington orchestra Hill conducted in 1892-1896. There are several <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> so: only two horns are required {{as well as two}} hand-tuned timpani (rather than pedal tuned ones). There is a copyist's contrabass part of the first three movements at the Mitchell Library, dated 1898, which gives the terminus ante quem for them.|$|R
500|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known whether}} the medial pallium plays a similar role in even more {{primitive}} vertebrates, such as sharks and rays, or even lampreys and hagfish. [...] Some types of insects, and molluscs such as the octopus, also have strong spatial learning and navigation abilities, but these appear to work differently from the mammalian spatial system, so there is as yet no good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that they have a}} common evolutionary origin; nor is there sufficient similarity in brain structure to enable anything resembling a [...] "hippocampus" [...] to be identified in these species. Some have proposed, however, that the insect's mushroom bodies may have a function {{similar to that of the}} hippocampus.|$|E
500|$|Khrushchev had no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> himself {{immune from}} the purges, and in 1937, confessed his own 1923 dalliance with Trotskyism to Kaganovich, who, {{according}} to Khrushchev, [...] "blanched" [...] (for his protégé's sins could affect his own standing) and {{advised him to}} tell Stalin. The dictator took the confession in his stride, and, after initially advising Khrushchev to keep it quiet, suggested that Khrushchev tell his tale to the Moscow party conference. Khrushchev did so, to applause, and was immediately reelected to his post. Khrushchev related in his memoirs that he was also denounced by an arrested colleague. Stalin told Khrushchev of the accusation personally, looking {{him in the eye}} and awaiting his response. Khrushchev speculated in his memoirs that had Stalin doubted his reaction, he would have been categorized as an enemy of the people then and there. Nonetheless, Khrushchev became a candidate member of the Politburo on 14 January 1938 and a full member in March 1939.|$|E
500|$|On 5 March 1495, Lisa married Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo, a {{modestly}} successful {{cloth and}} silk merchant, becoming {{his third wife}} at age15. Lisa's dowry was 170florins and the San Silvestro farm near her family's country home, {{a sign that the}} Gherardini family was not wealthy at the time and <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> she and her husband loved each other. The property lies between Castellina and San Donato in Poggio, near two farms later owned by Michelangelo. Neither poor nor among the most well-to-do in Florence, the couple lived a middle-class life. Lisa's marriage may have increased her social status because her husband's family may have been richer than her own. Francesco is thought to have benefited because Gherardini is an [...] "old name". They lived in shared accommodation until 5March 1503, when Francesco was able to buy a house next door to his family's old home in the Via della Stufa. Leonardo is thought to have begun painting Lisa's portrait the same year.|$|E

Thirdly, the effect is seen in many developed countries on several continents, all of which have a ‘Saturday/Sunday weekend concept’.|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Josephus' account overstates {{the role of}} the Pharisees.

As Josephus was himself a Pharisee, his account might represent a historical creation meant to elevate the status of the Pharisees {{during the height of the}} Hasmonean Dynasty.|$|R
40|$|Smiling can be {{interpreted}} as a costly signal of future benefits from cooperation between the individual smiling and the individual to whom the smile is directed. The target article by Niedenthal et al. gives little attention to the possible mechanisms by which smiling may have evolved.

500|$|Televised {{presidential debates}} were reintroduced {{for the first}} time since the 1960 election. As such, Ford became the first {{incumbent}} president to participate in one. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they [...] "gave the viewers <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Jimmy Carter had something to offer". The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, [...] "There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration." [...] Ford also said that he did not [...] "believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union". In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the spirits of eastern Europeans seeking independence. However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner Max Frankel was visibly incredulous at the response. As a result of this blunder, and Carter's promise of a full presidential pardon for political refugees from the Vietnam era during the presidential debates, Ford's surge stalled and Carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the growing}} tension, Haynes {{remained}} a member and Betts returned. Their third post-reunion record, Where It All Begins (1994), was recorded entirely live. [...] "The Allman Brothers was a year-by-year thing. There {{was no indication}} that it was capable of staying together for years to come. We all looked at it as each tour could be the last one, {{and there was no}} <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> otherwise," [...] said Haynes. The band continued to tour with greater frequency, attracting younger generations with their headlining of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could not make it through his acceptance speech. Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. During the 1996 run at the Beacon, turmoil came to a breaking point between Allman and Betts, nearly causing a cancellation of a show and causing another band breakup. [...] "We were upstairs in our dressing rooms [...] I’m sitting there thinking, 'This is it. This is how it finally ends,'" [...] said Trucks. Haynes and Woody left to focus on Gov't Mule, feeling as though a break was imminent with the Allman Brothers Band.|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} to {{distinguish}} between attributive and predicative goodness. There are good <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that artistic value {{is a kind of}} attributive goodness. Surprisingly, however, much debate in philosophical aesthetics has proceeded as though artistic value is a kind of predicative goodness. As I shall argue, recognising that artistic value is attributive goodness has important consequences for a number of debates in aesthetics...|$|R
