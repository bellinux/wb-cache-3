40|$|A new simple form {{window with}} the {{application}} of FIR filter design based on the π Base exponential function is proposed in this article. An improved window having a closed simple formula which is symmetric ameliorates <b>ripple</b> <b>ratio</b> in comparison with Kaiser and cosine hyperbolic windows. The proposed window has been derived {{in the same way}} as Kaiser Window, but its advantages have no power series expansion in its time domain representation. Simulation results show that proposed window provides better <b>ripple</b> <b>ratio</b> characteristics which are so important for some applications. A comparison with Kaiser window shows that the proposed window reduces <b>ripple</b> <b>ratio</b> in about 6. 4 dB which is more than Kaiser’s in the same mainlobe width. Moreover in comparison to cosine hyperbolic window, the proposed window decreases <b>ripple</b> <b>ratio</b> in about 6. 5 dB which is more than cosine hyperbolic’s.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{the design}} of useful window {{function}} containing together good properties of Kaiser and Ultraspherical windows preferred at many areas was implemented with helping of Genetic Algorithm (GA).

The ultraspherical window having three independent parameters has better sidelobe roll-off ratio than other windows in literature. At work, the coefficients of a new window function that has side-lobe roll-off ratio characteristic of ultraspherical window and Kaiser window's main-lobe width and <b>ripple</b> <b>ratio</b> were obtained by helping of GA.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{investigation}} of magnetic materials for high-power dcdc converters in hybrid and fuel cell vehicles and the development of an optimized high-power inductor for a multi-phase converter. The thesis introduces the power system architectures for hybrid and fuel cell vehicles. The requirements for power electronic converters are established and the dc-dc converter topologies of interest are introduced. A compact and efficient inductor is critical to reduce the overall cost, weight and volume of the dc-dc converter and optimize vehicle driving range and traction power. Firstly, materials suitable for a gapped CC-core inductor are analyzed and investigated. A novel inductor-design algorithm is developed and automated in order to compare and contrast the various magnetic materials over a range of frequencies and <b>ripple</b> <b>ratios.</b> The algorithm is developed for foil-wound inductors with gapped CC-cores in the low (10 kHz) to medium (30 kHz) frequency range and investigates the materials in a natural-convection-cooled environment. The practical effects of frequency, ripple, air-gap fringing, and thermal configuration are investigated next for the iron-based amorphous metal and 6. 5 % silicon steel materials. A 2. 5 kW converter is built to verify the optimum material selection and thermal configuration over the frequency range and <b>ripple</b> <b>ratios</b> of interest. Inductor size can increase in both of these laminated materials due to increased airgap fringing losses. Distributing the airgap is demonstrated to reduce the inductor losses and size but has practical limitations for iron-based amorphous metal cores. The effects of the manufacturing process are shown to degrade the iron-based amorphous metal multi-cut core loss. The experimental results also suggest that gap loss is not a significant consideration in these experiments. The predicted losses by the equation developed by Reuben Lee and cited by Colonel McLyman are significantly higher than the experimental results suggest. Iron-based amorphous metal has better preformance than 6. 5 % silicon steel when a single cut core and natural-convection-cooling are used. Conduction cooling, rather than natural convection, can result in the highest power density inductor. The cooling for these laminated materials is very dependent on the direction of the lamination and the component mounting. Experimental results are produced showing the effects of lamination direction on the cooling path. A significant temperature reduction is demonstrated for conduction cooling versus natural-convection cooling. Iron-based amorphous metal and 6. 5 % silicon steel are competitive materials when conduction cooled. A novel inductor design algorithm is developed for foil-wound inductors with gapped CC-cores for conduction cooling of core and copper. Again, conduction cooling, rather than natural convection, is shown to reduce the size and weight of the inductor. The weight of the 6. 5 % silicon steel inductor is reduced by around a factor of ten compared to natural-convection cooling due to the high thermal conductivity of the material. The conduction cooling algorithm is used to develop high-power custom inductors for use in a high power multi-phase boost converter. Finally, a high power digitally-controlled multi-phase boost converter system is designed and constructed to test the high-power inductors. The performance of the inductors is compared to the predictions used in the design process and very good correlation is achieved. The thesis results have been documented at IEEE APEC, PESC and IAS conferences in 2007 and at the IEEE EPE conference in 2008...|$|R

Based on the neoclassical transport theory, {{effects of the}} non-axisymmetry on the bootstrap (BS) current are investigated for a tokamak plasma which has toroidal field (TF) ripples. It is found that the BS current is reduced {{by a factor of}} a square root of the TF <b>ripple</b> <b>ratio</b> in a rippled tokamak. We also found that the reduction of the BS current due to TF ripples becomes small if we take the poloidal dependence of the TF <b>ripple</b> <b>ratio</b> into account. For helical plasmas, we have developed a net plasma current simulation code for integrated simulations, and analyze net plasma currents observed in a Large Helical Device (LHD) plasma. It is found that non-inductive currents can be sufficiently large to change the rotational transform profile at the plasma core region, even though the total current is too small to change the rotational transform at the plasma boundary. The effect of the inductive current is important for estimation of the net plasma current especially when the beam driven currents are considered. ...|$|E

Our use of aligned samples resolves issues concerning the ripple phase that were ambiguous from previous powder studies.

Moreover, the long ripple always forms an orthorhombic unit cell (� L� 90 °), strongly supporting the possibility that these ripples are symmetric.

The relative thermodynamic stability of the two types of ripples was investigated and a qualitative free energy diagram is given in which the long ripple phase is metastable. Finally, we suggest a kinetic mechanism, involving loss of water, that promotes formation of the metastable long ripple phase for special thermal protocols. PACS number�s�: 87. 16. �b, 87. 64.

30|$|In {{addition}} to the experimental studies, there exist substantial amount of theoretical studies to explain IBS-induced ripple formation. Bradley-Harper (B-H) theory and its extensions were invoked to explain ion erosion-induced ripple formation due to off-normal ion bombardment and its coarsening [22, 23]. Following these theories, there are reports which show that although ripples {{are more or less}} periodic in nature in the linear regime, with increasing time, it may change to a sawtooth-like morphology [9, 12, 13]. This type of transition from ripples to sawtooth or faceted structures was mentioned by Makeev and Barabasi for small surface gradients [24, 25] which was later generalized by Carter at intermediate ion energies (few tens of kiloelectron volts) for all surface gradients [26]. In his work, Carter showed (based on geometrical argument) that with the growth of <b>ripple</b> amplitude-to-wavelength <b>ratio,</b> the shadowing of the incident ion beam by surface features can lead to formation of sawtooth-like facets. In a later work, this model was applied to explain morphological transition observed under bombardment of silicon by 30 keV argon ions [27]. However, applicability of this very approach is yet to be explored for low-energy (hundreds of electron volts) ion-induced transition from ripples to faceted structures under continuous ion bombardment. A major reason for this is the lack of available experimental data on the formation of faceted structures using low-energy ions.|$|R

Double-stator {{switched}} reluctance machines {{benefit from}} a high torque density and a low radial force level in comparison with conventional switched reluctance machines resulting in a lower vibration and acoustic noise.

40|$|International audienceObjective: To {{evaluate}} scalp ripples {{distribution in}} secondary bilateral synchrony {{as a tool}} to lateralize the epileptic focus and to differentiate focal from generalized epilepsy. Methods: Seventeen EEG recordings with bilateral synchronous discharges of focal (focal group-FG: 10) and generalized (generalized group-GG: 7) epilepsy patients were selected for spikes and ripples marking; the spike-normalized ripple rate was calculated in each hemisphere (right/left - anterior/posterior) and a ripple-dominant hemisphere (the one with the highest rate) was identified. Concordance in FG between the ripple dominant hemisphere and the hemisphere of clinical lateralization was evaluated. The ripple-dominant/ripple-nondominant spike-normalized <b>ripple</b> rate <b>ratio</b> was studied to compare groups. Results: In FG the hemisphere of clinical lateralization and the ripple-dominant hemisphere were 100 % concordant. In GG only 3 / 7 patients showed ripples (vs 10 / 10 FG), all with anterior dominance. No difference in hemisphere ripple dominance between groups was found. Conclusions: Ripples in secondary bilateral synchrony help to lateralize the epileptic focus but do not help to differentiate between focal and generalized epilepsy. This is the first report of visually identified ripples in idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Significance: Ripples confirm the clinical lateralization of the epileptic focus in secondary bilateral synchrony but cannot distinguish between focal and generalized epilepsy.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that both ripples and dunes form in rivers by primary linear instability, the wavelength {{of the former}} scaling on the grain size, that of the latter being controled by the water depth. We revisit here this problem, using the computation of the turbulent flow over a wavy bottom performed in Part 1. The details of the different mechanisms controlling sediment transport are encoded into three quantities: the saturated flux, the saturation length and the threshold shear stress. Theses quantities are modelled {{in the case of}} erosion and momentum limited bed loads. This framework allows to give a clear picture of the instability in terms of dynamical mechanisms. The relation between the wavelength at which ripples form and the flux saturation length is quantitatively derived. Inverting the problem, experimental data is used to determine the saturation length as a function of grain size and shear velocity. Finally, using the systematic expansion of the flow field with respect to the corrugation amplitude, we discuss the non-linear selection of <b>ripple</b> aspect <b>ratio.</b> Investingating the effect of a free surface on the linear instability, we show that the excitation of standing waves at the surface has a stabilising effect, independently of the details of the flow and sediment transport models. Consequently, the shape of the dispersion relation is such that dunes can not result from a primary linear instability. We present the results of field experiments performed in the natural sandy Leyre river, which evidence the formation of ripples by a linear instability and the formation of dunes by a non-linear pattern coarsening limited by the free surface.

Since LED lamps require a power electronic driver to operate from ac line, the LED driver must also have a long life {{to take full advantage of}} the LED 2 ̆ 7 s longevity. However, the life of offline LED drivers is constrained by the use of limited-life electrolytic capacitors, as twice-line-frequency energy buffers, in them. Twice-line-frequency energy buffering is needed in all high power factor power electronic interfaces between single-phase ac and dc.

This {{makes it possible for}} the algorithm to be implemented by means of a short main program which uses (at each iteration) the linear phase FIR filter design algorithm of McClellan et al. as a subroutine. The approach taken also permits the filter to be designed with a desired <b>ripple</b> <b>ratio.</b> Also, the algorithm determines automatically the minimum passband ripple corresponding to the prescribed orders and band edges of the filter. The filter is designed directly without guessing the passband ripple or stopband ripple. Another algorithm, based on similar principles, is developed for the design of a nonlinear phase finite impulse response (FIR) filter, whose transfer function optimally approximates a desired magnitude response, there being no constraints imposed on the phase response. A similar algorithm is presented for the design of two new classes of FIR digital filters, one linear phase and the other nonlinear phase. A filter of either class has significantly reduced number of multiplications compared to the one obtained by its conventional counterpart, with respect to a given frequency response. In the case of linear phase, by introducing the new class of digital filters into the design of multistage decimators and interpolators for narrow-band filter implementation, it is found that an efficient narrow-band filter requiring considerably lower multiplication rate than the conventional linear phase FIR design can be obtained. The amount of data storage required by the new class of nonlinear phase FIR filters is significantly less than its linear phase counterpart. Finally, the design of a (finite-impulse-response) FIR digital filter with some of the coefficients constrained to zero is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem and the LP technique is then used to design this class of constrained FIR digital filters....

40|$|We present {{electron}} density maps (EDMs) of the ripple phase formed by phosphorylcholine lipids such as dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), dihexadecyl phosphatidylcholine, and dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC). With {{the exception of}} DLPC, the rippled bilayers have a sawtooth shape in all the systems, with one arm being almost {{twice as long as}} the other. For DMPC and POPC bilayers, EDMs have been obtained at different temperatures at a fixed relative humidity, and the overall shape of the <b>ripples</b> and the <b>ratio</b> of the lengths of the two arms are found to be insensitive to temperature. EDMs of all the systems with saturated hydrocarbon chains suggest the existence of a mean chain tilt along the ripple wave vector. In the literature it is generally assumed that the asymmetry of the rippled bilayers (absence of a mirror plane normal to the ripple wave vector) arises from a sawtoothlike height profile. However, in the case of DLPC, the height profile is found to be almost symmetric and the asymmetry results mainly from different bilayer thicknesses in the two arms of the ripple. We also present EDMs of the metastable ripple phase of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, formed on cooling from the Lalpha phase. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Two-layer low aspect <b>ratio</b> <b>rippled</b> and non-rippled {{solenoids}} {{mounted in}} surface trenches are described for superconductive {{magnetic energy storage}} utility applications. Open pool cooling in superfluid helium provides extended time cryogenic stability. Axial structure also functions as a protective heat absorbing secondary during emergency discharge. The cost of the conductor, trench, dewar, struts, radial structure, plus others are proportional to E^ 2 / 3 where E= stored energy; {{the cost of the}} axial structure is approximately E; and the cost of refrigeration is a constant plus an E^ 2 / 3 term. Costs scale approximately from E^ 0. 58 (low E) to E^ 0. 71 (100 - 3000 MWh) to E ^ 0. 78 (3000 to 10, 000 MWh). The cost of the ac-dc conversion system is about $ 60 /kW. The electrical usage is best for load-leveling units that charge 8 h at night and discharge 15 h during the daytime. 98 % storage efficiency and rapid power reversal are the two primary benefits of SMES. The potential impact of high Tc oxide superconductors is a 10 %- 20 % cost reduction for large SMES units (above 3000 MWh). The operational storage efficiency of smaller units would improve to better than 95 % for E > 10 MWh...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} discusses internal {{processes of}} porous media from multiple perspectives. In chapter 2, "Statistical Mechanics of Unsaturated Porous Media," we derive a statistical mechanical model of fluid retention characteristics in porous media {{in terms of}} known surface energies and void geometry within the permeable solid based on the Ising model from magnetism. In the limit of vanishing inertial and viscous forces, the theory predicts the fuid retention curve that relates saturation of the porous matrix to applied capillary pressure. We show how the fluid retention curve can be calculated from the statistical distribution of two dimensionless parameters measuring, respectively, the areas of link cross-section and wetted cavity surface with respect to cavity volume. The theory attributes hysteresis of the retention curve to collective first-order phase transitions in the network of cavities. Furthermore, we illustrate predictions with a porous domain consisting of a random packing of spheres, and reproduce the behavior of Haines jumps, which we associate with phase transitions. Chapters 3 and 4 features experimental studies of {{a particular type of}} particulate porous media - sand and explores the internal processes of sand dunes and their surface ripples. Chapter 3, "Temperature and Humidity within a Mobile Barchan Sand Dune," (co-authored with A. Valance, A. Ould el-Moctar, A. G. Hay and R. Richer), attempts at answering a practical question of potential importance to dune stabilization, whether temperature and moisture deep within relatively fast moving hyperarid mobile dunes present a suitable habitat for microbes. We contrast deep thermal records obtained from implanted probes with measurements of diurnal variations of the temperature profile just below the surface, and show that temperature within fast moving dunes is predictable, as long as dune advection is properly considered. Observations and analyses also suggest that small quantities of rain falling on the leeward face escape evaporation and endure within the dune until resurfacing upwind. At depths below 10 cm, we show that moisture, rather than temperature, determines the viability of microbes. Toward elucidating how a wavy porous sand bed perturbs a turbulent flow above its surface, in Chapter 4, "Pore Pressure in a Wind-swept Rippled Bed," (co-authored with R. A. Musa, S. Takarrouht, and M. E. Berberich), we record and model pressure within a permeable material resembling the region just below desert ripples. We discovered that, unlike flows on impermeable waves, the porous rippled bed diffuses the depression upstream, reduces surface pressure gradients, and gives rise to a slip velocity, thus affecting the turbulent boundary layer. Pressure gradients within the porous material also generate body forces rising with wind speed squared and <b>ripple</b> aspect <b>ratio,</b> partially counteracting gravity around crests, thereby facilitating the onset of erosion. Although these three essays differ in method and focus, they are all address the internal processes of porous media. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|R
