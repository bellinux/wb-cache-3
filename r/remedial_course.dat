To identify the causal effect of remediation we use a Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design, relying on the fact that students whose performance at a placement test was below a certain cutoff were assigned to the treatment. We deal with partial compliance using the assignment rule as an instrumental variable for the effective attendance to <b>remedial</b> <b>courses.</b> From our analysis it emerges that students just below the cutoff, attending the <b>remedial</b> <b>courses,</b> acquire a higher number of credits compared to students just above the cutoff. We also find that <b>remedial</b> <b>courses</b> reduce the probability of dropping out from academic career. On the other hand, we do not find any statistically significant effect on the average grade obtained at passed exams. <b>Remedial</b> <b>Courses,</b> Tertiary Education, Public Policy, Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design, Instrumental Variables...|$|R

500|$|In 1900, Chicago {{had one of}} {{the largest}} Czech populations of any city in the world, with {{approximately}} 75,000–100,000 Czechs living in the city's 10 Czech communities. Some 50,000 Czech immigrants were served by the three Czech parishes of Chicago—16,000 to 20,000 of them by St. Procopius. These Czech immigrants wanted to assimilate into American society, but also wanted to pass their language on to their children. The abbey established St. Procopius College and Academy in 1887 as a school that taught men of Czech and Slovak descent. It became the first Czech institution of higher learning in the nation, and in 1920 it remained the only Czech college. Rev. Procopius Neuzil was named the first teacher and director. Classes began on March 2, 1887, when Neuzil taught a <b>remedial</b> <b>course</b> to two students in two small rooms at 704 Allport Street. Enrollment grew to 20 within the week, taught by three instructors during the four-month term. The first full year of classes began in the fall of 1887. The college was chartered by the State of Illinois in 1890; only a two-year high school program was offered at the time. In 1893 the college published its first catalog, which urged Czech parents to enroll their 13-year-old boys. The academic curriculum included a preparatory year to teach elementary school subjects to remedial students. The two high school years were referred to as [...] "Latin years", and included required courses in Czech, English, Latin, math, orthography, history, and religion; optional courses included German and bookkeeping. Following the Latin years, students were enrolled in the business course, which included math, bookkeeping, economics, composition, history, oratory, and religion.|$|E

50|$|Post {{secondary}} remediation {{is delivered}} on both 2-year {{community college and}} 4-year university campuses in the U.S. The bulk of <b>remedial</b> <b>courses</b> focus on advancing underprepared students' literacy skills (English and reading) or math skills.

50|$|Effective {{and passionate}} {{instructors}} can provide remedial students with social capital, {{leading them to}} services ranging from tutoring and counseling. Students in <b>remedial</b> <b>courses</b> often end of performing “better than college-prepared students {{in terms of their}} grade point average, retention, and program completion.” Remedial students who attend community college orientations and receive more contact with tutoring, advising and mentoring services find these options to be rewarding. Those who complete <b>remedial</b> <b>courses</b> before college level courses often experience more benefits, including higher grade point averages, compared to their counterparts who do not take these <b>remedial</b> <b>courses</b> early in their college careers.|$|R
50|$|Many {{students}} are placed into <b>remedial</b> <b>courses</b> through placement tests {{such as the}} ACT, SAT, ACCUPLACER, or COMPASS assessments. Often, each college or university sets its own score thresholds for determining whether a student must enroll in <b>remedial</b> <b>courses.</b> However, some states are moving toward a uniform standard for remedial placement cut scores. Students are required to enroll in <b>remedial</b> <b>courses</b> before advancing to a college level course in that subject. Colleges review a student's score by subject - math, English, science, etc. - and compare that score to the school's cutoff. For example, a college might use a score of 19 on the ACT math section as the threshold for determining whether a student must enroll in a <b>remedial</b> math <b>course</b> or college-level math course.|$|R
50|$|In January 2007, the New York State Education Department {{reported}} deficiencies at the Katharine Gibbs New York campus.

50|$|Similarly, a {{nationwide}} study of two year college {{students participating in}} remedial education found 46% of students referred to remedial reading and 33% of students in math remediation completed their remedial sequence. A substantial portion of these non-completing students - 29% in math and 16% in reading - did so {{because they did not}} pass their <b>remedial</b> <b>course.</b> Another 11% of math students and 9% of reading students exited college without ever having failed or completed a <b>remedial</b> <b>course.</b> Students that enrolled in college and were placed into a sequence of 3 or more remedial courses were the least likely to persist to a college-level course. Like in all education pathways, there are many different points at which remedial students can step out of education. Research from the Community College Research Center at Colombia University suggests that many students do not complete their remedial sequences or do not enroll in the first college-level course in that subject.|$|E
50|$|Some {{students}} are placed into <b>remedial</b> <b>courses,</b> {{even when they}} only have minor issues, leading them to need to pass and complete <b>remedial</b> <b>courses</b> before being able to enroll in a basic course for that subject area. Likewise, some {{students are}} restricted from taking classes in other disciplines, such as physical sciences, until they complete developmental sequences. Students who take <b>remedial</b> <b>courses</b> may not have these count as college credits, and these students {{may be more likely}} to complete fewer college credits overall or stop out of college. Many community college instructors of <b>remedial</b> <b>courses</b> are part-time faculty members, which can prove challenging to students who require more assistance and contact. While some scholars debate whether money should be allocated toward remedial education, opponents argue that withholding these opportunities also has a direct impact on the quality of employees in the workforce if they continue to lack essential skills.|$|R
50|$|A {{national}} non-profit organization, Complete College America (CCA), {{was established}} in 2009 and looks at paths to improving higher education outcomes for all students. The organization has provided large amounts of national data on the proportion {{of students enrolled in}} <b>remedial</b> <b>courses</b> across demographic groups. The organization has also worked with states to set goals for increasing college completion and making adjustments to higher education policies. Currently, CCA heavily promotes enrolling more students directly into college-level courses even though they would traditionally test into <b>remedial</b> <b>courses.</b> The organization also heavily promotes better aligning <b>remedial</b> <b>courses</b> with college-level courses, and using diverse measures of student academic standing for remedial placement.|$|R

In Ohio, four in ten traditional-age students at community colleges enroll in <b>remedial</b> English <b>courses,</b> whereas six in ten enroll in remedial math. This state example reflects national studies that show a higher need for remedial community college students to take math courses, which also often have bigger class sizes and more levels of coursework than their remedial reading and writing counterpart courses. Students start taking remedial coursework in community colleges according to their performance on college placement tests, considered by some scholars to be far from perfect in their designs. Community colleges possess few admission requirements, meaning these types of institutions see a higher number of remedial students. Remedial education within community colleges may exist within an academic department, in its own academic department, or in an entire academic unit of its own.|$|R
