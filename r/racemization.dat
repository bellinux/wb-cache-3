25|$|Thalidomide is racemic; {{while the}} S-thalidomide is the {{bioactive}} {{form of the}} molecule, the individual enantiomers can racemize to each other due to the acidic hydrogen at the chiral centre, which is the carbon of the glutarimide ring bonded to the phthalimide substituent. The <b>racemization</b> process can occur in vivo.|$|E
25|$|SN1 {{reactions}} {{are associated with}} the <b>racemization</b> of the compound, as the trigonal planar carbocation may be attacked from either face. They are favored mechanism for tertiary haloalkanes, due to the stabilization of the positive charge on the carbocation by three electron-donating alkyl groups. They are also preferred where the substituents are sterically bulky, hindering the SN2 mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Since synephrine {{exists as}} either of two enantiomers (see Chemistry section below for further discussion), {{which do not}} produce {{identical}} biological effects (see Pharmacology section below) some researchers have examined the stereoisomeric composition of synephrine extracted from natural sources. Although {{it seems clear that}} synephrine is found in those Citrus species which have been studied predominantly as the l-isomer, low levels of d-synephrine have been detected in juice and marmalade made from C. unshiu, and low levels (0.002%) have been reported in fresh fruit from C. aurantium. There are indications that some d-synephrine may be formed by the <b>racemization</b> of l-synephrine {{as a result of the}} processing of fresh fruit, although this matter has not been completely clarified. However, regardless of the situation in Citrus species, Ranieri and McLaughlin reported the isolation of racemic (i.e. a mixture of equal amounts of d- and l- stereoisomers) synephrine from a cactus of the Dolichothele genus, under conditions that would be unlikely to cause a significant amount of <b>racemization.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pasteur was {{responsible}} for disproving the doctrine of spontaneous generation. He performed experiments that showed that without contamination, microorganisms could not develop. Under {{the auspices of the}} French Academy of Sciences, he demonstrated that in sterilized and sealed flasks nothing ever developed, and in sterilized but open flasks microorganisms could grow. Although Pasteur was not the first to propose the germ theory, his experiments indicated its correctness and convinced most of Europe that it was true. Today, he is often {{regarded as one of the}} fathers of germ theory. Pasteur made significant discoveries in chemistry, most notably on the molecular basis for the asymmetry of certain crystals and <b>racemization.</b> Early in his career, his investigation of tartaric acid resulted in the first resolution of what is now called optical isomers. His work led the way to the current understanding of a fundamental principle in the structure of organic compounds.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the realm}} of peptide synthesis, this product may be treated with an amine such as that found on an amino acid to release the {{imidazole}} group and couple the peptides. [...] The side products, carbon dioxide and imidazole, are relatively innocuous. [...] <b>Racemization</b> of the amino acids also tends to be minimal, reflecting the mild reaction conditions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of atropine {{starting from}} l-phenylalanine first undergoes a transamination forming phenylpyruvic acid {{which is then}} reduced to phenyl-lactic acid. [...] Coenzyme A then couples phenyl-lactic acid with tropine forming littorine, which then undergoes a radical rearrangement initiated with a P450 enzyme forming hyoscyamine aldehyde. [...] A dehydrogenase then reduces the aldehyde to a primary alcohol making (−)-hyoscyamine, which upon <b>racemization</b> forms atropine.|$|E
2500|$|Cyclosporin is {{synthesized}} by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, cyclosporin synthetase. The enzyme {{contains an}} adenylation domain, a thiolation domain, a condensation domain, and an N-methyltransferase domain. The adenylation domain {{is responsible for}} substrate recognition and activation, whereas the thiolation domain covalently binds the adenylated amino acids to phosphopantetheine, and the condensation domain elongates the peptide chain. Cyclosporin synthetase substrates include L-valine, L-leucine, L-alanine, glycine, 2-aminobutyric acid, 4-methylthreonine, and D-alanine, which is the starting amino acid in the biosynthetic process. With the adenylation domain, cyclosporin synthetase generates the acyl-adenylated amino acids, then covalently binds the amino acid to phosphopantetheine through a thioester linkage. Some of the amino acid substrates become N-methylated by S-adenosyl methionine. The cyclization step releases cyclosporin from the enzyme. Amino acids such as D-Ala and butenyl-methyl-L-threonine indicate cyclosporin synthetase requires the action of other enzymes such as a D-alanine racemase. The <b>racemization</b> of L-Ala to D-Ala is pyridoxal phosphate-dependent. The formation of butenyl-methyl-L-threonine is performed by a butenyl-methyl-L-threonine polyketide synthase that uses acetate/malonate as its starting material.|$|E
5000|$|In chemistry, <b>racemization</b> is the {{conversion}} of an enantiomerically pure mixture (one where only one enantiomer is present) into a mixture where {{more than one of}} the enantiomers are present. If the <b>racemization</b> results in a mixture where the D and L enantiomers are present in equal quantities, the resulting sample is described as a racemic mixture, a racemate, or racemic. [...] <b>Racemization</b> can proceed through a number of different mechanisms, and it has particular significance in pharmacology as different enantiomer may have different pharmaceutical effects.|$|E

50|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{reported}} procedures which take advantage of a chemical reagent/catalyst to perform <b>racemization</b> of the starting material and an enzyme to selectively react with one enantiomer, called chemoenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolutions. PSL-C was utilized along with a ruthenium catalyst (for <b>racemization)</b> to produce enantiopure (>95% ee) δ-hydroxylactones. More recently, secondary alcohols have been resolved by Bäckvall with yields up to 99% and ee's up to >99% utilizing CALB and a ruthenium <b>racemization</b> complex. A second type of chemoenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution involves a π-allyl complex from an allylic acetate with palladium. Here, <b>racemization</b> occurs with loss of the acetate, forming a cationic complex with the transition metal center, as shown below. Palladium has been shown to facilitate this reaction, while ruthenium has been shown to affect a similar reaction, also shown below.|$|E
50|$|<b>Racemization</b> can be {{achieved}} by simply mixing equal quantities of two pure enantiomers. <b>Racemization</b> can also occur in a chemical interconversion. For example, when (R)-3-phenyl-2-butanone is dissolved in aqueous ethanol that contains NaOH or HCl, a racemate is formed. The <b>racemization</b> occurs by way of an intermediate enol form in which the former stereocenter becomes planar and hence achiral. An incoming group can approach from either side of the plane, so there is an equal probability that protonation back to the chiral ketone will produce either an R or an S form, resulting in a racemate.|$|E

50|$|The rate {{at which}} <b>racemization</b> {{proceeds}} depends {{on the type of}} amino acid and on the average temperature, humidity, acidity (pH), and other characteristics of the enclosing matrix. Also, D/L concentration thresholds appear to occur as sudden decreases in the rate of <b>racemization.</b> These effects restrict amino acid chronologies to materials with known environmental histories and/or relative intercomparisons with other dating methods.|$|E

5000|$|Glutamate {{racemase}} {{is known}} to use its active site to undergo <b>racemization</b> {{and participate in the}} cell wall biosynthesis pathway of bacteria. Based on homology to other racemases and epimerases, glutamate racemase is thought to employ two active site cysteine residues as acid/base catalysts. Surprisingly however, substituting either of the two residues with serine did not appreciable change the rate of the reaction significantly; the kcat value remained within [...]3% to 3% compared to the wild-type enzyme. From previous studies, it is most likely that the active site of MurI that performs <b>racemization</b> is not the same active site that undergoes gyrase inhibition. In order to ascertain the effects of gyrase inhibition on cell wall synthesis, the efficiency of the conversion of D-glutamate to L-glutamate was measured while varying the concentration of DNA gyrase. Conversely, the effects of cell wall production on gyrase inhibition were discovered by varying the concentration of the <b>racemization</b> substrate. It has been shown that the two functions are neutral to each other. In other words, <b>racemization</b> substrates are neutral to gyrase inhibition, and DNA gyrase has no effect on <b>racemization.</b> This explains how glutamate racemase in certain bacteria, such as Glr from B. subtilis, do not inhibit gyrase; if one active site is involved with both functions, this independence would not be possible. Consequently, a different site of MurI, distant from its active site, is involved in interacting with gyrase.|$|E
5000|$|Substitution {{reactions}} that proceed through a free carbocation intermediate, such as unimolecular substitution reactions, lead to non-stereospecific addition of substituents {{which results in}} <b>racemization.</b>|$|E

50|$|His {{greatest}} impact upon organic chemistry was to propose the carbocation 2 as a reactive intermediate, originally as a rationalization of the <b>racemization</b> of isobornyl chloride 1 catalysed by a Lewis acid such as SnCl4. His proposed mechanism for <b>racemization</b> involved a subsequent 2,6 hydride transfer, {{which allows the}} carbocation to be located at either of these two symmetric positions. An alternative mechanism—a 1,2 methyl migration, a type of reaction now known as a Wagner-Meerwein shift—was in fact suggested {{for the first time}} by Josef Houben and Pfankuch.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{concerns}} {{to take into}} consideration when using a CDA in NMR spectroscopy are kinetic resolution, <b>racemization</b> during the derivatization reaction and that the reagent should have 100% optical purity. Kinetic resolution is especially significant when determining optical purity, but it is somewhat negligible when the CDA is being used to assign the absolute configuration of an optically pure substrate. Kinetic resolution can be overcome using excess of the CDA. <b>Racemization</b> can occur to either the CDA or the substrate and in both cases {{it has the potential to}} significantly affect the results.|$|E
5000|$|One such {{homologue}} {{has already}} been identified: OSBS from Amycolatopsis. OSBS from Amycolatopsis was first identified as N-acylamino acid racemase (NAAAR) because it was found to catalyze the <b>racemization</b> of N-acylamino acids. However, this ability was discovered for commercial reasons, and considering <b>racemization</b> of N-acylamino acids does not occur in Amycolatopsis, its actual job in the bacteria itself was unknown. In 1999, {{it was discovered that}} NAAAR's protein sequence was quite similar to another protein with an unknown function in Bacillus subtilis. Both proteins were found to efficiently catalyze the same reaction as OSBS in E.coli, and so this was deemed their [...] "correct" [...] function. [...] "NAAAR" [...] was properly renamed to OSBS. The hypothesis stated in the first paragraph of this section helps explain how the OSBS from Amycolatopsis can also catalyze the <b>racemization</b> of N-acylamino acids, as well as the diversity of catalytic differences among the enzymes of the enolase superfamily.|$|E
