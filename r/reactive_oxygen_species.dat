5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{basis for}} the toxicity of oxygen is the partial reduction of oxygen by one or two electrons to form <b>reactive</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>species,</b> which are natural by-products of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signalling. One species produced by the body, the superoxide anion (−), is possibly involved in iron acquisition. Higher than normal concentrations of oxygen lead to increased levels of <b>reactive</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>species.</b> Oxygen is necessary for cell metabolism, and the blood supplies it to {{all parts of the}} body. When oxygen is breathed at high partial pressures, a hyperoxic condition will rapidly spread, with the most vascularised tissues being most vulnerable. During times of environmental stress, levels of <b>reactive</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>species</b> can increase dramatically, which can damage cell structures and produce oxidative stress.|$|E
5|$|A related {{problem for}} aerobic organisms is {{oxidative}} stress. Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation {{and the formation}} of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce <b>reactive</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>species</b> such as hydrogen peroxide. These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant metabolites such as glutathione and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases.|$|E
5|$|In rodents and primates, {{sufficiently}} {{high doses}} of amphetamine cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, or damage to dopamine neurons, which is characterized by dopamine terminal degeneration and reduced transporter and receptor function. There {{is no evidence that}} amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans. However, large doses of amphetamine may indirectly cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity as a result of hyperpyrexia, the excessive formation of <b>reactive</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>species,</b> and increased autoxidation of dopamine. Animal models of neurotoxicity from high-dose amphetamine exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., core body temperature≥40°C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Prolonged elevations of brain temperature above 40°C likely promote the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals by facilitating the production of <b>reactive</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>species,</b> disrupting cellular protein function, and transiently increasing blood–brain barrier permeability.|$|E

Consistent with these data are our observations that (a) the mitochondrial membrane potential is maximal when uncoupling protein 1 is ablated or inhibited and (b) oxygen consumption rates in mitochondria from uncoupling protein 1 knock-out mice, are significantly lower than those from wild-type mice, but equivalent to those from wild-type mice {{in the presence of}} GDP.

At the same time, these organelles {{generate}} <b>reactive</b> <b>oxygen</b> and nitrogen <b>species</b> as byproducts. Peroxisomes also possess intricate protective mechanisms to counteract oxidative stress and maintain redox balance. An imbalance between peroxisomal <b>reactive</b> <b>oxygen</b> species/reactive nitrogen <b>species</b> production and removal may possibly damage biomolecules, perturb cellular thiol levels, and deregulate cellular signaling pathways implicated in a variety of human diseases. Somewhat surprisingly, the potential role of peroxisomes in cellular redox metabolism has been underestimated for a long time. However, in recent years, peroxisomal <b>reactive</b> <b>oxygen</b> species/reactive nitrogen <b>species</b> metabolism and signaling have become the focus of a rapidly evolving and multidisciplinary research field with great prospects. This review is mainly devoted to discuss evidence supporting the notion that peroxisomal metabolism and oxidative stress are intimately interconnected and associated with age-related diseases. We focus on several key aspects of how peroxisomes contribute to cellular <b>reactive</b> <b>oxygen</b> species/reactive nitrogen <b>species</b> levels in mammalian cells and how these cells cope with peroxisome-derived oxidative stress. We also provide a brief overview of recent strategies that have been successfully employed to detect and modulate the peroxisomal redox status. Finally, we highlight some gaps in our knowledge and propose potential avenues for further research.

Recently, it has been proposed that peroxiredoxins may play key roles in innate immunity and inflammation. Indeed, peroxiredoxins are evolutionarily conserved peroxidases able to reduce, with high rate constants, hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides and peroxynitrite which are generated during inflammation. In this minireview, we point out different possible roles of peroxiredoxins during inflammatory processes such as cytoprotective enzymes against oxidative stress, modulators of redox signaling, and extracellular pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns.

Hypothesized links between aging and oxidative stress are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging. A vicious cycle was thought to occur, as oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial DNA mutations, which can lead to enzymatic abnormalities and further oxidative stress.|$|E

However, the United States Department of Agriculture withdrew these ratings in 2012 as biologically invalid, stating that no physiological proof in vivo existed to support the free-radical theory or roles for ingested phytochemicals, especially for polyphenols. Consequently, the ORAC method, derived only from in vitro experiments, is no longer considered relevant to human diets or biology.|$|E

Hypoxemia also results {{in the production of}} <b>reactive</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>species,</b> which can activate these pathways, as well as nuclear factor-κB, which regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 transcription. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1 contribute to monocyte association with endothelial proteins, such as P-selectin, prompting monocytes to release tissue factor-filled microvesicles, which presumably begin clotting after binding to the endothelial surface.|$|E
5|$|The <b>reactive</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>species</b> {{produced}} in cells include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hypochlorous acid (HClO), and free radicals {{such as the}} hydroxyl radical (·OH) and the superoxide anion (O2−). The hydroxyl radical is particularly unstable and will react rapidly and non-specifically with most biological molecules. This species is produced from hydrogen peroxide in metal-catalyzed redox reactions such as the Fenton reaction. These oxidants can damage cells by starting chemical chain reactions such as lipid peroxidation, or by oxidizing DNA or proteins. Damage to DNA can cause mutations and possibly cancer, if not reversed by DNA repair mechanisms, while damage to proteins causes enzyme inhibition, denaturation and protein degradation.|$|E

We used single-cell approaches to determine the impact of oxidative and nitrosative stresses on individual Salmonella during early infection in mouse spleen. Salmonella encounter and respond to both stresses, but the levels and impact vary widely. Neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes kill Salmonella by generating overwhelming oxidative stress through NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase. This controls Salmonella within inflammatory lesions but does not prevent their spread to more permissive resident red pulp macrophages, which generate only sublethal oxidative bursts. Regional host expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase exposes some Salmonella to nitrosative stress, triggering effective local Salmonella detoxification through nitric oxide denitrosylase. Thus, <b>reactive</b> <b>oxygen</b> {{and nitrogen}} <b>species</b> influence dramatically different outcomes of disparate Salmonella-host cell encounters, which together determine overall disease progression...|$|R

These findings have significant implications for development of therapeutics and identification of novel biomarkers for Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.
