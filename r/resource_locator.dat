5|$|A Uniform Resource Name (URN) may be {{compared}} to a person's name, while a Uniform <b>Resource</b> <b>Locator</b> (URL) may {{be compared}} to their street address. In other words, a URN identifies an item and a URL provides a method for finding it.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} {{three and a half}} years, as the World Wide Web's core {{technologies}} of HTML, HTTP, and web browsers developed, a need to distinguish a string that provided an address for a resource from a string that merely named a resource emerged. Although not yet formally defined, the term Uniform <b>Resource</b> <b>Locator</b> came to represent the former, and the more contentious Uniform Resource Name came to represent the latter.|$|E
5|$|Such {{identification}} enables {{interaction with}} {{representations of the}} resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The {{most common form of}} URI is the Uniform <b>Resource</b> <b>Locator</b> (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web address. More rarely seen in usage is the Uniform Resource Name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.|$|E

25|$|A DOI name {{differs from}} {{commonly}} used Internet pointers to material, {{such as the}} Uniform <b>Resource</b> <b>Locator</b> (URL), in that it identifies an object itself as a first-class entity, rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time. It implements the Uniform Resource Identifier (Uniform Resource Name) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|The generic URL (Uniform <b>Resource</b> <b>Locator)</b> syntax {{allows for}} a query string to be {{appended}} to a file name in a web address so that additional information can be passed to a script; the question mark, or query mark, ?, is used to indicate {{the start of a}} query string. A query string is usually made up of a number of different name–value pairs, each separated by the ampersand symbol, &. For example, http://www.example.com/login.php?username=test=blank.|$|E

AT will not terminate, disconnect or suspend service because of the views you or we express on public policy matters, political issues or political campaigns." ...|$|E
2500|$|The DOI system offers persistent, semantically-interoperable {{resolution}} to related current data and is {{best suited to}} material {{that will be used}} in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as [...] "identifiers" [...] doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other [...] "identifier systems" [...] may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include Persistent Uniform <b>Resource</b> <b>Locator</b> (PURL), URLs, Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., ARK).|$|E
2500|$|However, in 2007 the U.S. District Court {{struck down}} even the reauthorized NSLs because the gag power was unconstitutional as courts could still {{not engage in}} {{meaningful}} judicial review of these gags. On August 28, 2015, Judge Victor Marrero of the federal district court in Manhattan ruled the gag order of Nicholas Merrill was unjustified. In his decision, Judge Marrero described the FBI's position as, [...] "extreme and overly broad," [...] affirming that [...] "courts consistent with the First Amendment, simple accept the Government's assertions that disclosure would implicate and create a risk." [...] He {{also found that the}} FBI's gag order on Mr. Merrill [...] "implicates serious issues, both with respect to the First Amendment and accountability of the government to the people." [...] Initially, the ruling was released in redaction by Judge Marrero. The FBI was given 90 days to pursue any other alternative course of action, but elected not to do so. Upon release of the unredacted ruling on November 30, 2015, it was revealed {{for the first time the}} extent to which the FBI's NSL accompanied by a gag order sought to collect information. Through the court documents, it was revealed for the first time that through an NSL, the FBI believes it can legally obtain information including an individual's complete web browsing history, the IP addresses of everyone a person has corresponded with, and all the records of all online purchases within the last 180 days. The FBI also claims via the extension of a NSL, it can obtain cell site location information. In the landmark case of Nicholas Merrill the FBI in specific sought to seek the following information on an account: DSL account information, radius log, subscriber name and related subscriber information, account number, date the account opened or closed, addresses associated with the account, subscriber day/evening telephone numbers, screen names or other on-line names associated with the account, order forms, records relating to merchandise orders/shipping information for the last 180 days, all billing related to the account, internet service provider (ISP), all email addresses associated with the account, internet protocol address assigned to the account, all website information registered to the account, uniform <b>resource</b> <b>locator</b> address assigned to the account, any other information which you consider to be an electronic communication transactional record. This was the first time it was revealed the extent to which an NSL under the Patriot Act could request communication information.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. How to {{distribute}} <b>resource</b> <b>locators</b> {{is a fundamental}} problem in PKI. Our PKI Resource Query Protocol (PRQP), recently presented at IETF, provides a standard method to query for PKI <b>resources</b> <b>locators.</b> However the distribution of locators across PKIs is still an unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose an extension to PRQP in order {{to distribute}} PRQP messages over a Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) network. In this work, we combine PRQP with Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) to efficiently distribute contents over a dynamic P 2 P overlay network. In particular we present the PEACH protocol and a PEACH Enabled System (PEACHES) which are specifically targeted toward solving the PKI resources discovery problem. Our work enhances interoperability between existing PKIs and allows for easy configuration of applications, thus augmenting usability of PKI technology. ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the sense}} of domain names, used in Uniform <b>Resource</b> <b>Locators</b> (URLs), a fully {{qualified}} domain name is explicitly suffixed with a dot, to eliminate the step of resolving, {{and to ensure that}} no additional suffix is added: [...] for instance.

40|$|Citation of {{scientific}} materials {{published on the}} Internet is often cumbersome because of unwieldy uniform <b>resource</b> <b>locators</b> (URLs). The authors describe a format for URLs that simplifies citation of scholarly materials. Its use depends on a simple HTML device, the “refresh page. ” Uniform citation would follow this format: [Author I. Title of article. [URL]]. The HTML code for such a page is:. The code instructs the browser to suppress {{the content of the}} refresh page and bring up the title page of the cited article instead. Citations would be succinct and predictable. An electronic journal would not need to alter its existing file hierarchy but would need to establish a distinct domain name and maintain a file of refresh pages. Utilization of the “shadow” URL would bring us one step closer to truly universal <b>resource</b> <b>locators...</b>|$|R
