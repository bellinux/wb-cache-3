40|$|We {{study the}} effect of the rotating-wave {{approximation}} (RWA) and the secular approximation (SA) on the non-Markovian behavior in the spin-boson model at zero-temperature. We find that both the <b>RWA</b> and <b>SA</b> lead to a dramatic reduction in the observed non-Markovianity. In general, non-Markovian dynamics is observed for the whole relaxation time of the system, whereas the <b>RWA</b> and <b>SA</b> lead to such dynamics only on the short time scale of the environmental correlation time. Thus, the <b>RWA</b> and <b>SA</b> are not necessarily justified in the studies of non-Markovianity although they can estimate the state of the system precisely.

40|$|Food {{security}} is of major importance {{due to the}} increasing world population with 8. 9 billion people expected by 2050 (Cohen, 2003). Diuraphis noxia (RWA), have caused aggravating, massive losses to wheat farmers {{in many areas of}} the world. If unchecked, RWA are able to destroy plants resulting in major economic impacts (Botha, 2013). Due to ineffective use of other control methods, the Small Grains Institute in Bethlehem, South Africa, have therefore developed resistant cultivars to the known RWA subtypes over the past decades through intensive breeding programmes (Tolmay et al., 2006). Climate change has however become a major factor threatening food security especially with the observed increase in CO 2 from less than 300 ppm in pre-industrial period to the current 385 ppm and is predicted to reach 550 ppm by 2050 (IPCC, 2007; Meehl et al., 2007). Elevated CO 2 concentration may affect individual species of a community hence the need to understand the wheat-aphid interactions. In this study, population growth rates and virulence of <b>RWA</b> <b>SA</b> 1 at ambient (385 ppm) and elevated (450 ppm) CO 2 concentration were evaluated on two wheat cultivars: Tugela Dn (resistant) and Scheepers (susceptible). Fluorescence microscopy techniques using aniline blue were used to investigate feeding related damage caused by <b>RWA</b> <b>SA</b> 1 through an examination of callose deposition at the two CO 2 concentration. A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method was developed in order to determine the effect of <b>RWA</b> <b>SA</b> 1 on the wheat cultivars proteome at the two CO 2 concentration. Differentially expressed proteins that were up or down regulated more than two fold were identified using PDQuestTM Basic 2 D Gel analysis software. Populations of <b>RWA</b> <b>SA</b> 1 increased significantly on the two wheat cultivars at both CO 2 concentration. Although the population growth rate for <b>RWA</b> <b>SA</b> 1 on both cultivars was generally exponential at all treatments, growth at elevated CO 2 concentration was noticeably faster with populations increasing 3 fold in 14 days as compared to the 2 times at ambient CO 2 concentration. Hence, both cultivars provided a better quality host for <b>RWA</b> <b>SA</b> 1 at 450 ppm than 385 ppm. There was no significant difference between <b>RWA</b> <b>SA</b> 1 population on Tugela Dn and on Scheepers at elevated CO 2 concentration on day 14 after infestation which means there was a change in the resistance mechanism in Tugela Dn at this condition. Approximately 70 % of the total leaf showed chlorosis by 21 days of aphid infestation for both cultivars although the susceptible cultivar was more vulnerable. There was low callose deposition in the controls (uninfested plants) but heavy callose in infested plants due to aphid feeding. A proteomics approach was used as a pilot study to investigate whether it would be possible to identify the changes in the resistance mechanism during aphid infestation under elevated CO 2 levels. The major changes in the proteome of the control group (uninfested Tugela Dn at ambient versus elevated CO 2 concentration) occurred in the early events (day 1 - 7) in the molecular weight range of approximately 25 kDa to 55 kDa are mainly within the basic to neutral pH range. This was suggested to be a result of mechanisms to adjust to the CO 2 concentration. Elevated CO 2 results in instant higher photosynthetic rates and C:N ratios as well as changes in expression levels of SA-dependant defense genes (Lindroth 1995; Hughes and Bazzaz, 2001; Sun et al., 2013). Because most of these changes are directly regulated by proteins, it is expected that the most differential protein expression will occur immediately after the atmospheric changes (early events) as was shown in the study. Infested plants under elevated and ambient conditions showed that the stress conditions gave rise to differentially regulated proteins within the wheat proteome. Most changes occurred elevated CO 2 levels. It can be suggested that the changes were a result of differentially regulated plant defence proteins which fall in this range (25 kDa - 80 kDa) such as peroxidases, chitinases and Î²- 1. 3 -glucanases as well as protein kinases, heat-shock proteins and photosynthetic proteins. These results indicate that there has been changes in the resistance due to elevated CO 2 because of the evident changes in the proteome. If so, then the results will be similar to those documented by Louw (2007) where up-regulation was due to putative storage proteins, proteins involved in photosynthesis, heat shock proteins and defense proteins. Of course, the pI value and molecular mass of the proteins and the identification of the proteins in these spots, must be determined in future work to specifically identify whether these suggestions are authentic. However, Louw (2007) also reports that the susceptible Betta wheat cultivar, displayed a defence response similar to the HR although it was unable to up-regulate specific defensive proteins against RWA infestation but proteins for broad resistance. Although the changes in the proteins in infested Tugela Dn under elevated CO 2 concentration were not accurately identified, the defense mechanism is similar to that portrayed by the susceptible Betta wheat cultivar which shows that the resistance mechanism had been overcome. Because this was a pilot study and preliminary results were obtained due to limited funding and time constraints, suggestions were made on how to further develop the method to obtain statistically significant results...|$|R

However, pretreatment with 10 mu M SA enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the concentrations of non-enzymatic antioxidants, but lowered the concentrations of H 2 O 2 and MDA in the Cd-stressed rice compared with the Cd treatment alone. Pretreatment with SA alleviated the Cd-induced inhibition of root growth. The results showed that pretreatment with SA enhanced the antioxidant defense activities in Cd-stressed rice, thus alleviating Cd-induced oxidative damage and enhancing Cd tolerance. The possible mechanism of SA-induced H 2 O 2 signaling in mediating Cd tolerance was discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Drought stress alone or combined with mild fertilization; continuous salicylic acid (SA) application alone or combined with mild fertilization and time course effects of mechanical damage and <b>SA</b> <b>exposure</b> alone and combined were analyzed. Drought stress did not affect final plant biomass, promoted significant increase of uliginosin B (40 -fold in the leaves and 6 -fold in the reproductive parts), HP 1, HP 3 and TPC, whereas the stress applied on mild fertilized plants increased biomass and uliginosin B (7. 5 -fold and 1. 5 -fold in the leaves and reproductive parts, respectively) and HP 3 (4. 4 -fold in the leaves) concentrations, unaffecting TPC. Continuous application of 2 mM SA alone or combined with mild fertilization resulted in similar increase of uliginosin B and TPC. Time course experiments of mechanical damage with and without SA (10 mM) {{as well as the}} treatment with SA induced the biosynthesis of uliginosin B in the leaves, with higher levels verified in wounded plants after 2 days (5 -fold) and 7 days (3 -folds) of treatment, reducing or not affecting benzopyrans accumulation.

We assumed that SA induced in dividing cells early genetic instability. Subsequently, we in vitro stabilized those V 79 -Cl 3 cells dividing {{at the end}} of SA-treatment and maintained for long without SA (ASO cells). In ASO cells, we observed chromosomal rearrangements, increased spontaneous mutations, genome-wide DNA hypomethylation (GWDH), similarly to exposed cells. We inferred that a short-term <b>SA</b> <b>exposure</b> has long-term effects and that GWDH enhances the genetic instability. Consequently, we evaluated GWDH in HaCaT keratinocytes at several time points during expanded growth following SA removal. We found a persistent GWDH, and some specific gene promoters (DNMT 3 A, DNMT 3 B, HMLH 1) methylation changes. We suggest that the SA-treated cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming at gene/genome level that is durable over many cell generations in the absence of SA, contributing to long-lasting genomic instability SA-induced. Obtaining several individual clones isolated at different time points from the growing ASO cells, we observed in someone, chromosomal and morphological instability, higher ROS, aberrant DNA methylation. We also noted that all the ASO clones with low SOD 1 and high ROS acquired a transformed phenotype and moreover that the increase of ROS was accompanied by defective telomerase activity. We propose that cells escaping the SA-induced death, perpetuate the memory of past exposure via ROS because of antioxidant and telomerase activity impairment and ultimately they acquire a transformed phenotype...|$|R

Countless studies have demonstrated its harm to health and many more studies investigating its pathogenic mechanisms. While the CS-induced pathogenic mechanism of cardiovascular dysfunction has been mainly attributed {{to a combination of}} oxidative imbalance, vascular endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and modification of lipid profile, the focus of the current study was on the mediators of inflammation and the activation of signal pathways. In this study, we investigated the effects of CS on the pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory status in the heart and to elucidate the activation of specific signaling pathways in an in vivo rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into groups of CS exposure and sham air (SA) and exposed to 1 hour of respective CS and <b>SA</b> <b>exposure</b> daily for 56 days. The rats were then sacrificed and the ventricular homogenates were examined. Cardiac pro- inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL) - 6, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC- 1), transforming growth factor (TGF) -Î² 1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and IL- 10 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the activation of specific signaling pathways was determined by Western blot analysis. CS caused suppression of cardiac CRP, IL- 6, TGF-Î² 1, and IL- 10 and elevation of VEGF, revealing the imbalance of pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory status. Nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) was also activated along with the activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) but not p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) after 56 days of CS exposure. These data suggests the presence of a local adaptive mechanistic response to modulate cardiac pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory status via NF-ÎºB/MAPK pathways after exposure to CS. These findings shed insight into the mechanistic pathways of CVD progression, allowing possible identification of selected mediators as biomarkers that could benefit early detection of CVD arisen from cigarette smoking. published_or_final_versionPharmacology and PharmacyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|R

We showed that apoptosis-inducing concentrations of SA activate the p 38 MAPK signaling pathway in these cells. Therefore, we tested the role of p 38 MAPK signaling pathway activation in apoptosis induction by SA in NES 2 Y cells. Crosstalk between p 38 MAPK pathway activation and accompanying ERK pathway inhibition after SA application was also tested. The inhibition of p 38 MAPK expression by siRNA silencing resulted in a decrease in MAPKAPK- 2 activation after SA application, but it had no significant effect on cell viability or the level of phosphorylated ERK pathway members. The inhibition of p 38 MAPK activity by the specific inhibitor SB 202190 resulted in inhibition of MAPKAPK- 2 activation and noticeable activation of ERK pathway members after SA treatment but in no significant effect on cell viability. p 38 MAPK overexpression by plasmid transfection produced an increase in MAPKAPK- 2 activation after <b>SA</b> <b>exposure</b> but no significant influence on cell viability or ERK pathway activation. The activation of p 38 MAPK by the specific activator anisomycin resulted in significant activation of MAPKAPK- 2. Concerning the effect on cell viability, application of the activator led to apoptosis induction similar to application of SA (PARP cleavage and caspase- 7, - 8, and - 9 activation) and in inhibition of ERK pathway members. We demonstrated that apoptosis-inducing concentrations of SA activate the p 38 MAPK signaling pathway and that this activation could be involved in apoptosis induction by SA in the human pancreatic Î²-cells NES 2 Y. However, this involvement {{does not seem to}} play a key role. Crosstalk between p 38 MAPK pathway activation and ERK pathway inhibition in NES 2 Y cells seems likely. Thus, the ERK pathway inhibition by p 38 MAPK activation does not also seem to be essential for SA-induced apoptosis. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|R

Ultrastructurally, Betta-Dn 1 sustained less damage to the vascular tissue {{as well as to}} the mesophyll during the experimental period. Both inter- and intracellular probes resulted in considerable saliva deposition as the aphids probed for suitable feeding sites. Salivary tracks were observed between and within mesophyll, bundle sheath cells as well as the vascular tissue, including the xylem. Disruption of organelles and cytoplasm resulted from cell probing and sheath deposition. Cell and organelle damage was more evident in the non-resistant Betta cultivar. The aphids probed for and fed from thin-walled sieve tubes preferentially. Few thick-walled sieve tubes showed evidence of either aphid probing or feeding-related damage. Saliva was deposited when the aphids probed inter- and intracellularly for feeding sites. The aphids appeared preferentially to probe for and feed from thin-walled sieve tubes, as few thick-walled sieve tubes showed evidence of damage. Vessels, apparently probed for water, contained watery saliva that encased the secondary walls and sealed pit membranes between probed vessels and xylem parenchyma. The xylem probed by the RWA was rendered non-functional, probably contributing to symptoms of leaf roll, chlorosis and necrosis, which were observed within two weeks of infestation in the susceptible Betta cultivar.

40|$|Poster Discussion Session - A 108 How Useful Are Animal Models Of Lung Disease?RATIONALE: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is characterized by}} airway limitation together with abnormal inflammation in the lung. One of the major causes of this disease is cigarette smoke (CS). Increased systemic serotonin (5 -HT) level in non-smokers after inhaling CS (Clin Investig 1992; 70 : 201 - 204) and the association of the genetic polymorphism of 5 -HT transporter with pulmonary hypertension in COPD (Respiration 2010; 79 : 288 - 295), point towards a role of serotonin in COPD. This {{study was to investigate}} circulating 5 -HT levels in comparison to levels of oxidative stress in an in vivo experimental rat model after CS exposure. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 2 groups, i. e. sham air (SA) and 4 % CS for 56 days. <b>Exposure</b> to <b>SA</b> or 4 % CS was performed for 1 h/day in the ventilated smoking chamber. The animals were sacrificed 24 h after last exposure. Serum was collected and analyzed for 5 -HT levels by HPLC, markers of oxidative stress such as 8 -isoprostane by ELISA and advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) by kinetic assay. RESULTS: CS exposure elevated serum 5 -HT (5. 4 Â± 1. 5 Î¼g/ml versus 10. 6 Â± 1. 3 Î¼g/ml, p = 0. 03) and serum 8 -isoprostane (507. 9 Â± 98. 4 pg/ml versus 940. 8 Â± 92. 5 pg/ml, p = 0. 02) in comparison to <b>SA</b> <b>exposure.</b> In contrast, serum AOPP level was significantly lower in CS-exposed group compared to SA-exposed group (28. 2 Â± 3. 9 Î¼M versus 20. 8 Â± 2. 7 Î¼M, p = 0. 04). Conclusion: We revealed that smoking exposure was associated with high levels of 5 -HT and 8 -isoprostane but low level of AOPP. The present finding may provide evidence of the importance of a causal relationship between smoking and 5 -HT concentrations. Further studies will be required to elucidate the mechanism of CS on how 5 -HT interfere oxidative stress in circulation and in lung.

A 24 h exposure to 95 % O 2 increased P. aeruginosa (PA) adherence 57 % in A 549 cells (P < 0. 01) and 115 % in 16 HBE cells (P < 0. 01), but {{had little effect on}} S. aureus (<b>SA)</b> adherence. <b>Exposure</b> to hyperoxia, followed by a 1 h incubation with SA, further enhanced PA adherence (P< 0. 01) suggesting that hyperoxia and SA colonization may enhance the susceptibility of lung epithelial cells to gram-negative infections.

Stable or transient overexpression of MnSOD reduced both basal and stimulated levels of PA adherence and IL- 8 levels in response to exposure to either hyperoxia or PA.

MiR- 223 and miR- 486 prevailed in HDL 2, while miR- 92 a predominated in HDL 3, all three miRNAs discriminating between ACS and SA patients; their levels were increased in HDL from hyperglycemic ACS patients versus normoglycemic ones. The incubation of human macrophages with sera from ACS and SA patients showed that all patients' sera induced an increase of Drosha, DGCR 8 and Dicer expressions and of selected miRNAs levels compared to control sera, the effect being higher in the case of hyperglycemic versus normoglycemic ACS sera. The addition of glucose to SA and ACS sera increased Drosha, DGCR 8 and Dicer expression and miRNAs levels in the exposed macrophages.

40|$|The {{hypothalamus}} is {{a critical}} controller of homeostatic responses and plays {{a fundamental role in}} reward-seeking behaviour. Recently, hypothalamic neurones in the perifornical/lateral hypothalamic area (PF/LHA) have also been implicated in drug-seeking behaviour through projections to extra-hypothalamic sites such as the ventral tegmental area. For example, a population of neurones that expresses the peptide orexin has been strongly implicated in addiction-relevant behaviours. To date, the effect of addictive drugs on synaptic properties in the hypothalamus remains largely unexplored. Previous studies focusing on the PF/LHA neurones, however, have shown that the orexin system exhibits significant plasticity in response to food or sleep restriction. This neuroadaptive ability suggests that PF/LHA neurones could be highly susceptible to modifications by drug exposure. Here, we sought to determine whether cocaine produces synaptic plasticity in PF/LHA neurones. Whole-cell patch-clamp techniques were used {{to examine the effects of}} experimenter-administered (passive) or self-administered (SA) cocaine on glutamatergic synaptic transmission in PF/LHA neurones. These experiments demonstrate that both passive and <b>SA</b> cocaine <b>exposure</b> increases miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency in PF/LHA neurones. In addition, SA cocaine reduced the paired-pulse ratio but the AMPA/NMDA ratio of evoked excitatory inputs was unchanged, indicative of a presynaptic locus for synaptic plasticity. Dual-labelling for orexin and excitatory inputs using the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT 2), showed that passive cocaine exposure increased VGLUT 2 -positive appositions onto orexin neurones. Further, a population of recorded neurones that were filled with neurobiotin and immunolabelled for orexin confirmed that increased excitatory drive occurs in this PF/LHA population. Given the importance of the PF/LHA and the orexin system in modulating drug addiction, we suggest that these cocaine-induced excitatory synapse-remodelling events within the hypothalamus may contribute to persistence in drug-seeking behaviour and relapse...|$|R

(-) -Epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG), the major catechins in Chinese green tea, has been studied for its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties in cell and animal models. In this study, we aimed to analyze the effects of EGCG on cigarette smoke (CS) -induced airway inflammation and mucus secretion in the CS-exposed rat model. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into either sham air (<b>SA)</b> or CS <b>exposure.</b> EGCG (50 mg/kg b. wt.) was given by oral gavage every other day in both SA and CS-exposed animals. Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were determined in serum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by biochemical assays or ELISA. Lung morphological changes were examined by Periodic Acid-Schiff, Massonâs Trichrome staining and immunohistochemical analysis. Western blot analysis was performed to explore the effects of EGCG on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -mediated signaling pathway. Results: (-) -Epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate treatment attenuated CS-induced oxidative stress, lung cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant- 1 release and neutrophil recruitment. CS exposure caused an increase in the number of goblet cells in line with MUC 5 AC upregulation, and increased lung collagen deposition, which were alleviated in the presence of EGCG. In addition, CS-induced phosphorylation of EGFR in rat lung was abrogated by EGCG treatment. Conclusion: (-) -Epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate treatment ameliorated CS-induced oxidative stress and neutrophilic inflammation, as well as airway mucus production and collagen deposition in rats. The present findings suggest that EGCG has a therapeutic effect on chronic airway inflammation and abnormal airway mucus production probably via inhibition of EGFR signaling pathway...|$|R

To {{determine}} if a serine protease inhibitor A 3 K (SA 3 K) reduces TNF-alpha-induced declines in rabbit corneal endothelial junctional barrier integrity. METHODS. New Zealand rabbit corneas were incubated ex vivo for 24 hours in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10 % FBS with or without TNF-alpha, in {{the presence or absence}} of SA 3 K at different concentrations. Corneal endothelial barrier function permeability was determined based on measurements of FITC-dextran tissue accumulation. Apical junctional complex (AJC) integrity was evaluated of zonula occludens- 1 (ZO- 1), vascular endothelial (VE) -cadherin, and filamentous actin (F-actin) and associated microtubules, as well as myosin light chain (MLC) by immunofluorescent staining, Western blot analysis, and/or RT-PCR. RESULTS. TNF-alpha (20 ng/mL) increased corneal endothelial FITC-dextran permeability by 1. 8 -fold compared with the untreated control. SA 3 K (100 - 200 nM) dose dependently suppressed TNF-alpha-induced increases in permeability. SA 3 K nearly completely reversed TNF-alpha-induced disruptions of tight junctional ZO- 1 and subjacent adherens junctions VE-cadherin integrity. Interestingly, SA 3 K reversed TNF-alpha-induced disruption of AJC linkage to the cytoskeletal F-actin array by restoring F-actin double-band structures. SA 3 K also attenuated TNF-alpha-induced microtubule disassembly. Furthermore, SA 3 K blocked increases in MLC phosphorylation status elicited by TNF-alpha. CONCLUSIONS. <b>SA</b> 3 K <b>exposure</b> markedly reduced TNF-alpha-induced disruption of barrier structure and function in the rabbit corneal endothelium by maintaining AJC integrity. These protective effects are due to suppression of MLC activation. SA 3 K may have, in vivo, a therapeutic potential to offset TNF-alpha-induced declines in endothelial barrier structural integrity and function...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundWe {{assessed}} {{the risk of}} spontaneous abortion (<b>SA)</b> after inadvertent <b>exposure</b> to HPV- 16 / 18 -vaccine during pregnancy using an observational cohort design. MethodsThe study population included women aged 15 â 25 years registered with the Clinical Practice Research Datalink General Practice OnLine Database in the United Kingdom (UK), who received at least one HPV- 16 / 18 -vaccine dose between 1 st September 2008 and 30 th June 2011. Exposed women had {{the first day of}} gestation between 30 days before and 45 days (90 days for the extended exposure period) after any HPV- 16 / 18 -vaccine dose. Non-exposed women had the first day of gestation 120 daysâ 18 months after the last dose. SA defined as foetal loss between weeks 1 and 23 of gestation (UK definition). ResultsThe frequency of SA was 11. 6 % (among 207 exposed) and 9. 0 % (632 non-exposed), women: hazard ratio (HR) adjusted for age at first day of gestation 1. 30 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 79 â 2. 12). Sensitivity analysis per number of doses administered (â 30 to + 45 -day risk period) showed a HR for SA of 1. 11 (0. 64 â 1. 91) for 18 / 178 women with one dose during the risk period versus 2. 55 (1. 09 â 5. 93) in 6 / 29 women with two doses within a 4 â 5 weeks period. The proportion of pre-term/full-term/postterm deliveries, small/large for gestational age infants, and birth defects was not significantly different between exposed and non-exposed women. Results were consistent using a (United States) SA definition of foetal loss between weeks 1 â 19 and/or the extended risk period. ConclusionThere was no evidence of an increased risk of SA and other adverse pregnancy outcomes in young women inadvertently HPV- 16 / 18 -vaccinated around gestation. Nevertheless, women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant are advised to postpone vaccination until completion of pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|IF : 6, 99 International audienceSensation/novelty-seeking is {{amongst the}} best markers of cocaine {{addiction}} in humans. However, its implication in the vulnerability to cocaine addiction {{is still a}} matter of debate, as {{it is unclear whether}} this trait precedes or follows the development of addiction. Sensation/novelty-seeking trait has been identified in rats on the basis of either novelty-induced locomotor activity (high-responder (HR) trait) or novelty-induced place preference (high-novelty-preference trait (HNP)). HR and HNP traits have been associated with differential sensitivity to psychostimulants. However, it has recently been demonstrated that HR rats do not develop compulsive cocaine self-administration (<b>SA)</b> after protracted <b>exposure</b> to the drug, thereby suggesting that at least one dimension of sensation/novelty seeking in the rat is dissociable from the vulnerability to switch from controlled to compulsive cocaine SA. We therefore investigated whether HNP, as measured as the propensity to choose a new environment in a free choice procedure, as opposed to novelty-induced locomotor activity, predicts the vulnerability to, and the severity of, addiction-like behavior for cocaine. For this, we identified HR/LR rats and HNP/LNP rats before any exposure to cocaine. After 60 days of cocaine SA, each rat was given an addiction score based on three addiction-like behaviors (persistence of responding when the drug is signaled as not available, high breakpoint under progressive ratio schedule and resistance to punishment) that resemble the clinical features of drug addiction, namely inability to refrain from drug seeking, high motivation for the drug and compulsive drug use despite adverse consequences. We show that, as opposed to HR rats, HNP rats represent a sub-population predisposed to compulsive cocaine intake, displaying higher addiction scores than LNP rats. This study thereby provides new insights into the factors predisposing to cocaine addiction, supporting the hypothesis that addiction is sustained by two vulnerable phenotypes: a 'drug use prone' phenotype such as HR which brings an individual to develop drug use and an 'addiction prone' phenotype, such as HNP, which facilitates the shift from sustained to compulsive drug intake and addiction...|$|R
40|$|Silymarin is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used herbal medicine by patients with chronic liver disease. Silymarin flavonolignans undergo rapid first-pass metabolism primarily by glucuronidation. The aims of this investigation were: (1) to determine the association of UGT 1 A 1 * 28 polymorphism with the area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) for silybin A (SA) and silybin B (SB); (2) to evaluate the effect of UGT 1 A 1 * 28 polymorphism on the profile of flavonolignan glucuronide conjugates found in the plasma; and (3) to investigate the role of UGT 1 A 1 enzyme kinetics on the pharmacokinetics of SA and SB. AUCs and metabolic ratios for thirty-three patients with chronic liver disease administered oral doses of silymarin were compared between different UGT 1 A 1 * 28 genotypes. The AUCs, metabolic ratios, and the profiles of major SA and SB glucuronides did not differ significantly among the three UGT 1 A 1 genotypes. In contrast, an increase in the proportion of sulfated flavonolignan conjugates in plasma was observed in subjects with UGT 1 A 1 * 28 /* 28 genotype compared to subjects carrying wild type alleles. Differences in SA and SB in vitro intrinsic clearance estimates for UGTIA 1 correlated inversely with <b>SA</b> and SB <b>exposures</b> observed in vivo indicating a major role for UGT 1 A 1 in silymarin metabolism. In addition, {{a significant difference in the}} metabolic ratio observed between patients with NAFLD and HCV suggests that any effect of UGT 1 A 1 polymorphism may be obscured by a greater effect of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of silymarin. Taken together, these results suggest the presence of the UGT 1 A 1 * 28 allele does not contribute significantly to a large inter-subject variability in the pharmacokinetics of silybin A and silybin B which may obscure the ability to detect beneficial effects of silymarin in patients with liver disease...|$|R

40|$|Session - C 67 Emphysema: Animal Models and Treatment ModalitiesINTRODUCTION: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) is a progressively destructive airway disease {{mainly caused by}} smoking. Systemic and lung inflammation persists in COPD patients even after smoking cessation. Chronic inflammation and/or oxidative stress cause lung damage due {{to the release of}} destructive proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) - 2 / 9 / 12. Chinese green tea is thought to have both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects in different systems. This study is to address whether cigarette smoke (CS) exposure would induce lung inflammation, oxidative stress and MMPs activity, and whether Chinese green tea would reverse such effects. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups, i. e. sham air (SA), 4 % CS, 2 % Lung Chen tea plus SA or 4 % CS. Exposure to sham air or 4 % CS was performed for 1 h/day for 56 days in ventilated smoking chambers. Lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were obtained from rats sacrificed 24 h after last CS exposure. The protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines were determined by ELISA. The MMP activity was assessed by gelatin and casein zymography respectively. Local oxidative damage was determined by staining lung sections with anti- 8 -oxo-dG antibody and the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in lung homogenates. RESULTS: Elevation of interleukin (IL) - 1 b/- 6, interferon (IFN) -g and cytokine induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) - 1 was observed in lung after CS exposure. MMP- 12 activity was increased in BALF in CS-exposed rats. There were no differences between <b>SA</b> or CS <b>exposure</b> in MMP- 2 /- 9 activities in BALF. Pretreatment of Chinese green tea reversed local DNA oxidation and IL- 6 elevation (1. 48 Â± 0. 25 vs 0. 67 Â± 0. 14 ng/mg protein, for CS and Tea/CS respectively; p < 0. 01) but did not affect other pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and MMP- 12 activity. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that cigarette smoke exposure led to lung inflammation, local oxidative stress and elevation of protease activity in our rat model. These results support that Chinese green tea might be beneficial to smoke-induced local oxidative damage and inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Poster Abstracts: PD 01 - 07 BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) family {{comprises}} of nine subtypes with organ-specific expression, some {{of which}} are associated with organ injury. Intermittent hypoxia (IH), a prominent feature of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), may lead to ischemia/repurfusion-related tissue injury, while cigarette smoking (CS), the main cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is known to cause lung parenchymal destruction. To establish a rat model in the investigation whether IH and/or CS exposure would induce changes of FABP mRNA expressions in heart and lung tissues. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham air (SA) or cigarette smoking (CS) plus intermittent normoxia (IN) or intermittent hypoxia (IH). The <b>SA</b> or CS <b>exposure</b> was performed in the ventilated smoking chamber for 1 h, followed by IN or IH exposure using OxyCycler A 84 System (BioSpherix, Redfield, NY, USA) daily. The IH profile was characterized by 1. 5 -min hypoxia (10 % oxygen) followed by 4. 5 -min normoxia (21 % oxygen) for 6 h. Rats were sacrificed after 14 days and FABPs (H-, A-, and E-FABP) mRNA levels in heart and lung tissues were determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: All three FABP subtypes were expressed in both heart and lung tissues, with higher expression levels detected in the heart. Neither H- nor A-FABP expression was found to be affected by IH or CS in both tissues, while E-FABP significantly upregulated by IH in heart (1. 46 -fold elevation in SA + IH compared with SA + IN group, P < 0. 05) and by CS in lung (1. 6 -fold elevation in CS + IN compared with SA + IN group, P < 0. 05), respectively. However, there was no synergistic or additive effect of IH and CS on E-FABP expression by both tissues. E-FABP mRNA expression levels were time-dependently increased after CS exposure, peaking at 28 day and starting to drop at 56 day. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data suggested that IH and CS exert differential regulation on specific FABP expressions in rat heart and lung tissues, and that EFABP may serve as one of the biomarkers for the IH and/or CS-induced heart or lung injuries. Further studies are required to investigate the post-transcriptional changes of these FABP subtypes and the involved mechanisms...|$|R
