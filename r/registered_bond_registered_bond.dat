50|$|In the United States, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 {{substantially}} curtailed {{the issue}} of debt in bearer form. The Act disallowed a tax-deduction of interest paid on any such bonds issued after 1982 by the issuer {{in the case of}} corporate bonds, and removed the tax-exemption of the interest to the holder in the case of municipal <b>bonds.</b> In contrast, <b>registered</b> <b>bonds</b> retained the tax-exempt treatment. A challenge to this tax treatment by the U.S. state of South Carolina was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of South Carolina v. Baker (1988), which upheld the law and brought to an end the further issue of virtually all U.S. municipal bearer bonds.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work was to develop systems of solid free form (SFF) manufacture capable of being used for mass production {{as well as for}} rapid prototyping (RP). Existing commercial RP systems are far too slow for mass production and are limited in the range of materials they can use. This restricts them to specialised applications and the production of prototypes. Literature search, followed by analysis and assessment pointed to printing and thermography as the most suitable technologies for further investigation. A major aim was to take advantage of existing technologies as far as possible. The main components of a prototype system were then analysed in order to identify necessary adaptations and improvements. This generated a number of highly innovative developments that were then combined to produce a system involving concurrent printing, thermographing, annealing, stacking, <b>registering,</b> <b>bonding</b> and height adjustment of coatings (SFF layers) to form parts. To confirm the level of innovation and likely future development, assessment was made of current developments in the field of SFF manufacture and printing. Prospects for commercialisation were identified by reference to extensive market research relating to the system. The concurrency of the system allows it to be substantially faster than commercial systems that are largely consecutive in their modes of operation (between 150 and 800 times faster than an SLA 5000). The use of the thermography allows a high deposition rate {{of a wide range of}} materials including thermopolymers, thermosets, metals, ceramics and glass. These advantages make the system very suitable for mass-production. Financially, the system is likely to be relatively inexpensive (around £ 6, 000 compared with £ 327, 300 for an SLA 5000), since it makes use of existing highly developed and readily available technologies. Several of these inventions have been patented and a company, “Rapid Manufacturing Systems Limited” has now been formed to exploit the innovations...|$|R

The simulations revealed a variety of loo p conformers that exhibited a hydrogen bond network involving the Asp 23 and Ser 26 amino acids. A population of conformers, not part of the loop population, was found to form metastable β-hairpin structures with the highest probability in the Iowa mutant. At least three β-hairpin structures were found that differed in their hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>register,</b> average number of backbone hydrogen bonds, and lifetimes. Analysis revealed that the Dutch mutant had the longest β-hairpin lifetime (≥ 500 ns), closely followed by the Iowa mutant (≈ 500 ns). Aβ 21 - 30 and the Arctic mutant had significantly lower lifetimes (≈ 200 ns). Hydrophobic packing of side chains was responsible for enhanced β-hairpin lifetimes in the Dutch and Iowa mutants, whereas lifetimes in Aβ 21 - 30 and its Arctic mutant were influenced by the backbone hydrogen bonding. The data suggest that prolonged β-hairpin lifetimes may impact peptide pathogenicity in vivo. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|R

This is done by finding defaulted issuers from the <b>bonds</b> <b>registered</b> in the Norwegian Trustees database Stamdata. The information about defaulted and non-defaulted companies is coupled with financial and other characteristics {{available at the time}} of the bond issue. From a univariate assessment, the typical issuer that defaulted in the Norwegian High Yield bond had lower profits relative to their debt already before issuance, was significantly smaller than a non-non defaulted issuer, the issue had higher coupon rates adjusted for the level of interbank interest rates, and the issued amount was higher relative to the issuer’s total assets. Of the defaults found in the final sample of 176 issuers, 35 of the 59 (59 %) observed defaults involved issuers that founded their companies less than six years from the issue year. Some of the rather surprisingly results regarding the liquidity ratios and the book equity ratio must be seen in connection with the relative high amount of start-up firms defaulting. Logistic regressions were carried out with default as the dependent variable using the variables in the SEBRA-basic bankruptcy prediction model developed by the Central Bank of Norway. The model performs decent when classifying the non-defaulted companies, but breaks down when classifying the defaulted companies. The logistic regressions back up the conclusions from the univariate analysis regarding profits relative to debt level, the size of the company, and that a start-up firm are more prone to default on their bond issues than more matured companies...|$|R
