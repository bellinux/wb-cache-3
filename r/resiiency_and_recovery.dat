40|$|Background: Large {{components}} for athletes are nutrition, training <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> These components are subjects all by them selves in {{all kind of}} media.

Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate how athletes feelings and experience of nutrition, training <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> Method: A qualitative approach was used to investigate athletes eye on nutrition, training <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> Ten interviews were done face to face and notes was taken since no recording were done. Results: The results of the study shows that athletes don’t have experience of nutrition, training <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> together. Athletes have knowledge of nutrition, training <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> one by one. The study showed the athletes the dependency of nutrition, training <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> together.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Current {{databases}} need logging <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> {{to maintain}} the correctness properties of transactions and consistency of the database under failures. Also, logging <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> have tremendous performance implications. While {{there has been a}} lot of work that deals with logging <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> algorithms for traditional disk resident databases ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) and Main Memory Databases (MMDB) ([6, 7]), researchers have not systematically explored the issue of logging <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> in Real-Time Databases (RTDB). In fact, there is a need 109 110 REAL-TIME DATABASE SYSTEMS: ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNIQUES for designing new algorithms for logging <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> in RTDBs because the sequential nature of logging and the lack of time and priority cognizance during recovery are not in tune with the priority oriented and preemptive nature of activities in RTDBs. This chapter motivates the need to do logging <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> differently in Real-Time Databa...|$|R

40|$|It is {{not known}} whether {{changing}} from isoflurane to desflurane during {{the latter part of}} anesthesia shows early emergence <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> in long surgery. We therefore evaluated the effects of changing isoflurane to desflurane on emergence <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> Eighty-two patients were randomly assigned to receive isoflurane (Group I) or desflurane (Group D) or to change from isoflurane to desflurane anesthesia (Group X). At the point when there was an hour until the operation would end, isoflurane was replaced with 1 MAC of desflurane in Group X, and isoflurane and desflurane were maintained at 1 MAC in Groups I and D. When the operation ended, we compared the emergence <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> characteristics among the 3 groups. Compared with Group I, Group X showed faster emergence <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> Group X <b>and</b> Group D showed similar emergence <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> In conclusion, changing isoflurane to desflurane during the latter part of anesthesia improves emergence <b>and</b> <b>recovery...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{efficacy}} of three anaesthetic agents (Clove oil, 2 -phenoxyethanol and benzocaine) was compared in captive-bred Himri barbel, Carasobarbus luteus (Heckel, 1843). The lowest effective concentrations based on {{the efficacy}} criteria of complete anesthesia induction within 180 sec <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> within 300 sec were determined to be 75 mg L - 1 (induction 143 ± 15 sec <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> time 149 ± 35 sec) for clove oil, 500 μL L - 1 (induction 145 ± 27 sec <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> time 57 ± 16 sec) for 2 -phenooxyethanol and 50 mg L - 1 (induction 152 ± 49 sec <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> time 88 ± 24 sec) for benzocaine. The onset of individual phases of anesthesia <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> times depended significantly on the concentration of the anaesthetic used (p< 0. 05).

Based on this notion, we study three protocols for real-time quasi-durable checkpointing <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> For each protocol, we analyze its recoverabiliq and provide the su-cient and necessary conditions for a set of device to be feasible for checkpointing <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> 1.

40|$|Despite a {{proliferation}} {{of a number of}} studies on service failures <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> in e-service settings, there is a paucity of knowledge of ways in which service failures <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> practices are implemented in the fashion industry. Drawing on constructivist perspective, this study offers a new perspective on an effective relational mechanism that would bridge the rupture between consumers and companies particularly in the on-line fashion sector. The analysis adds to studies on service failures <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> by elucidating recovery strategies relevant to retailers’ operations in on-line environments. This analysis advances knowledge of on-line service failures <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> in the UK fashion industry. Findings indicate that consumer expectations of service failures <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> are context driven, which requires companies to fine-tune their recovery strategies to improve recovery satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Detection {{of forest}} {{disturbance}} <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> has received much attention {{during the last}} two decades due to its important influence on forest carbon budget estimation.

Field inventory data and high spatial resolution images were used to evaluate the disturbance <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> results. This research indicates that high producer and user accuracies for both disturbance <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> classes were obtained and three levels of disturbance <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> each can be detected.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between AA/NA involvement <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> from substance dependence using a loss-gain paradigm. Structural equation modeling was used to test a model using multidimensional measures of AA/NA involvement <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> AA/NA involvement was positively and significantly associated with recovery. As expected, perceived social support and spirituality were found to be mediators in the relationship between AA/NA involvement <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> However, the effects of spirituality diminished when other variables were controlled. Contrary to expectations, coping strategies was not a mediator in the relationship between AA/NA involvement <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> ^ A significant finding was the positive association between perceptions of recovery-related gains vs. losses <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> Perceptions of gains vs. losses in recovery served as a mediator in the relationship between AA/NA involvement <b>and</b> <b>recovery,</b> {{as well as in the}} relationship between perceived social support <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> This finding has implications for practitioners who work with clients who are substance dependent. ^ The findings from this study also have important implications for future research on the factors associated with recovery from substance dependence. Using the loss-gain paradigm outlined in this study as a guide, future researchers can continue to explore recovery using a loss-gain lens, providing further insight into how perceptions of gains vs. losses in recovery may be associated with recovery. ...|$|R
