5000|$|Third, {{riparian}} owners may {{be entitled}} to the [...] "prior appropriation" [...] of a watercourse. Where the reasonable use doctrine requires courts to balance the competing interests of riparian owners, the doctrine of prior appropriation initially grants a superior legal right to the first <b>riparian</b> <b>owner</b> who makes a beneficial use of a watercourse. The prior appropriation doctrine is applied in most arid western states, including Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming and requires the <b>riparian</b> <b>owner</b> to demonstrate that she is using the water in an economically efficient manner. Consequently, the rights of a <b>riparian</b> <b>owner</b> under the prior appropriation doctrine are always subject {{to the rights of}} other riparian owners who can demonstrate a more economically efficient use.|$|E
5000|$|... "Under the {{doctrine}} of a servitude, the <b>riparian</b> <b>owner</b> enjoys his property sub modo, i.e. subject {{to the right of}} the public to reserve space enough for levees, public works, and the like; that over this space the front proprietor never acquires complete dominion. It never passes free of this reservation to a purchaser." ...|$|E
50|$|An {{owner or}} {{possessor}} {{of land that}} abuts a natural stream, river, pond, or lake is called a <b>riparian</b> <b>owner</b> or proprietor. The law gives riparian owners certain rights to water that are incident to possession of the adjacent land. Depending on the jurisdiction in which a watercourse is located, riparian rights generally {{fall into one of}} three categories.|$|E
50|$|However, this {{qualified}} right {{does not}} entitle <b>riparian</b> <b>owners</b> to transport water {{away from the}} land abutting the watercourse. Nor does it permit <b>riparian</b> <b>owners</b> to use the water for most irrigation projects or commercial enterprises. Sprinkling gardens and watering animals are normally considered permissible uses under the natural flow doctrine of riparian rights.|$|R
50|$|When two <b>riparian</b> <b>owners</b> assert {{competing}} claims {{over the}} exercise of certain water rights, courts applying the reasonable use doctrine generally attempt to measure the economic value of the water rights to each owner. Courts also try to evaluate the prospective value to society that would result from a <b>riparian</b> <b>owner's</b> proposed use, {{as well as its}} probable costs. No single factor is decisive in a court's analysis.|$|R
50|$|In {{replacing}} the natural flow doctrine, {{a majority of}} jurisdictions in the United States now permit <b>riparian</b> <b>owners</b> to make any reasonable use of water that does not unduly interfere with the competing rights and interests of other <b>riparian</b> <b>owners.</b> Unlike the natural flow doctrine, which seeks to preserve water in its original condition, the reasonable use doctrine facilitates domestic and commercial endeavors that are carried out in a productive and reasonable manner.|$|R
50|$|Gold {{has been}} mined commercially in Wales (see Welsh gold) and Scotland. In the UK, gold {{prospecting}} {{can only take}} place with the explicit permission of the <b>riparian</b> <b>owner,</b> and any activities that cause or permit pollution of a watercourse, even re-suspended silt, {{could result in a}} criminal prosecution by the Environment Agency. There are locations where gold panning is a popular activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{reasonable}} use of {{the water}} by a <b>riparian</b> <b>owner</b> {{is subject to the}} downstream riparian owners 'riparian right' to receive waters undiminished in flow and quality. Since all surface waters eventually flow to the public ocean, federal regulatory authority under the Clean Waters Act, like the Clean Air Act, extends beyond only public (navigable) waters to prevent downstream pollution.|$|E
5000|$|In Scranton v. Wheeler the {{government}} constructed a long dike on submerged {{lands in the}} river to aid navigation.

This Supreme Court held that {{the government}} had not 'taken' any property and stated: ...|$|E
5000|$|Second, <b>riparian</b> <b>owners</b> may be {{entitled}} to the [...] "reasonable use" [...] of a watercourse. States that recognize the reasonable use doctrine found the natural flow doctrine too restrictive. During the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century, some U.S. courts applied the natural flow doctrine to prohibit <b>riparian</b> <b>owners</b> from detaining or diverting a watercourse for commercial development, such as manufacturing and milling, because such development impermissibly altered the water's original condition.|$|R

5000|$|This {{power to}} {{regulate}} navigation confers upon the United States a dominant servitude, FPC v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., 347 U.S. 239, 249 (1954), which extends to the entire stream and the stream bed below ordinary high-water mark. The proper exercise of this power is not an invasion of any private property rights in the stream or the lands underlying it, for the damage sustained does not result from taking property from <b>riparian</b> <b>owners</b> {{within the meaning of}} the Fifth Amendment but from the lawful exercise of a power to which the interests of <b>riparian</b> <b>owners</b> have always been subject. United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co., 312 U.S. 592, 596-597 (1941); Gibson v. United States, 166 U.S. 269, 275-276 (1897). Thus, without being constitutionally obligated to pay compensation, the United States may change the course of a navigable stream, South Carolina v. Georgia, 93 U.S. 4 (1876), or otherwise impair or destroy a <b>riparian</b> <b>owner's</b> access to navigable waters, Gibson v. United States, 166 U.S. 269 (1897); Scranton v. Wheeler, 179 U.S. 141 (1900); United States v. Commodore Park, Inc., 324 U.S. 386 (1945), even though the market value of the <b>riparian</b> <b>owner's</b> land is substantially diminished.|$|R
5000|$|First, {{riparian}} owners may {{be entitled}} to the [...] "natural flow" [...] of a watercourse. Under the natural flow doctrine, riparian owners {{have a right to}} enjoy the natural condition of a watercourse, undiminished in quantity or quality by other riparian owners. Every <b>riparian</b> <b>owner</b> enjoys this right to the same extent and degree, and each such owner maintains a qualified right to use the water for domestic purposes, such as drinking and bathing.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the eminent}} domain {{clause of the}} Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution limits the power {{of state and federal}} governments to impinge on the {{riparian}} rights of landowners by prohibiting the enactment of any laws or regulations that amount to a [...] "taking" [...] of private property. Laws and regulations that completely deprive a <b>riparian</b> <b>owner</b> of legally cognizable water rights constitute an illegal governmental taking of private property for Fifth Amendment purposes. The Fifth Amendment requires the government to pay the victims of takings an amount equal to the fair market value of the water rights.|$|E
5000|$|The navigational {{servitude}} of the United States {{does not}} extend beyond the high-water mark. Consequently, when fast lands are taken by the Government, just compensation must be paid. Fast lands are the lands located above the high-water mark. But [...] "just as the navigational privilege permits the Government to reduce the value of riparian lands by denying the <b>riparian</b> <b>owner</b> access to the stream without compensation for his loss, [...] [...] [...] it also permits the Government to disregard the value arising from this same fact of riparian location in compensating the owner when fast lands are appropriated." ...|$|E

5000|$|Riparian rights {{include such}} things as the right to access for swimming, boating and fishing; the right to wharf out to a point of navigability; the right to erect {{structures}} such as docks, piers, and boat lifts; the right to use the water for domestic purposes; the right to accretions caused by water level fluctuations; the right to exclusive use if the waterbody is non-navigable. Riparian rights also depend upon [...] "reasonable use" [...] as it relates to other riparian owners to ensure that the rights of one <b>riparian</b> <b>owner</b> are weighed fairly and equitably with the rights of adjacent riparian owners.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{natural asset}} was land, and the run-off in streams or rivers was incidental. Since access to flowing waters was {{possible}} only over private lands, access became a right annexed to the shore. The law followed {{the principle of}} equality which requires that the corpus of flowing water become no one's property and that, aside from rather limited use for domestic and agricultural purposes by those above, each <b>riparian</b> <b>owner</b> {{has the right to}} have the water flow down to him in its natural volume and channels unimpaired in quality. The riparian system does not permit water to be reduced to possession so as to become property which may be carried away from the stream for commercial or nonriparian purposes. In working out details of this egalitarian concept, the several states made many variations, each seeking to provide incentives for development of its natural advantages.|$|E
5000|$|Riparian {{rights are}} {{generally}} {{described as the}} rights to use and enjoy the profits and advantages of the water. See78 Am.Jur.2d Waters § 263 (1975). The <b>riparian</b> <b>owner</b> {{has a right to}} make such use of the lake over its entire surface, in common with all other abutting owners, provided such use is reasonable and does not unduly interfere with the exercise of similar rights on the part of other abutting owners. Johnson v. Siefert, 100 N.W.2d 689, 697 (1960). Riparian rights include the right to build and maintain, for private or public use, wharves, piers, and landings on the riparian land and extending into the water. State v. Korrer, 148 N.W. 617, 622 (1914). They also include such rights as hunting, fishing, boating, sailing, irrigating, and growing and harvesting wild rice.

40|$|In times past streams were {{commonly}} dammed {{to provide}} water power for machinery, improve navigation, or serve some other business purpose. The dams today pose serious {{problems for the}} public and for <b>riparian</b> <b>owners</b> 2 ̆ 7 along the dammed streams, problems stemming from either operation of the dams or failure to maintain them properly. The dams are operated to further the business purposes {{for which they were}} built, sometimes resulting in water levels or flows detrimental to game fish in the streams and to shoreline recreational property. 2 When the old dams cease to be economical to operate, as often has happened, the owners may stop maintaining them and allow their decay, or may remove them altogether. Either response results in lowering the water level of the impoundment, thereby exposing previously submerged land and piling along the edges of the pond to the aesthetic and financial detriment of persons owning improved shoreline property. <b>Riparian</b> <b>owners</b> downstream may also experience unwanted changes to their property through changes in the current and quantity of stream flow effected by decay or removal of the dam...|$|R
50|$|The {{appropriation}} doctrine {{was adopted}} in Colorado in 1872 when the territorial court ruled in Yunker v. Nichols, 1 Colo. 552 (1872), that a non-riparian user {{who had previously}} applied part of the water from a stream to beneficial use had superior rights to the water {{with respect to a}} <b>riparian</b> <b>owner</b> who claimed a right to use of all the water at a later time. The question was not squarely presented again to the Colorado Court until 1882 when in the landmark case, Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Co., 6 Colo. 443 (1882), the court explicitly adopted the appropriation doctrine and rejected the riparian doctrine, citing Colorado irrigation and mining practices {{and the nature of the}} climate. The decision in Coffin ruled that prior to adoption of the appropriation doctrine in the Colorado Constitution of 1876 that the riparian doctrine had never been the law in Colorado. Within 20 years the appropriation doctrine, the so-called Colorado Doctrine, had been adopted, in whole or part, by most of the states in the Western United States that had an arid climate.|$|E

40|$|Though at {{one time}} in England {{there may have been}} some doubt as to the {{character}} of a <b>riparian</b> <b>owner</b> 2 ̆ 7 s rights in the waters of the stream, it must be considered as definitely settled by a series of cases that the doctrine of reasonable use by all the proprietors on the stream is the rule of the common law, and that the matter of priority of use or appropriation is, under that system, immaterial, unless, of course, a question of prescriptive right is involved. Wright v. Howard, 1 Sim. 2 ̆ 6 S. 190; Mason v. Hill, 3 B. 2 ̆ 6 Ad. 304, 5 id. I; Wood v. Waud, 3 Exch. 748; Embrey v. Owen, 6 Exch. 353; Sampson v. Hoddinott, 1 C. B. (N. S.) 590, Miner v.

See 3 KENT, COMM. * 439. The rule of law is clear, the difficulties arise in its application to particular cases in the determination of the question as to whether a certain use is reasonable or not. In the second edition of his splendid treatise on IRRIGATION AND WATER RIGHTS, Mr. KINNEY has said: 2 ̆ 2 Under the common law there are three classes of uses which the riparian proprietors may or may not make of the waters of a stream flowing by their lands.
