5|$|Initial {{gameplay}} of Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth comprises unarmed {{escape and}} evasion together with investigative exploration, although first-person shooter (FPS) style combat is introduced later on. As with most survival horror video games, ammunition is limited {{and must be}} conserved carefully for situations when it will <b>really</b> <b>be</b> indispensable, occasionally requiring the player to avoid combat even when armed. The game {{as a whole is}} heavily scripted and very linear, with only one path through the chapters from start to finish, in contrast with some earlier survival horror games such as the original Alone in the Dark (which itself was inspired by the Mythos).|$|E
5|$|Julius Seelye Bixler {{reviewed}} the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review {{he wrote that}} he believed Stace was trying to have his {{cake and eat it}} with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can <b>really</b> <b>be</b> free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement. A year later, he reviewed Time and Eternity alongside Religion and the Modern Mind. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.|$|E
5|$|The climax {{is reached}} on Dr. Impossible's island, as he {{attempts}} to start a controlled Ice Age, making him Earth's ruler and only source of energy. He almost succeeds, using the hammer formerly belonging to the supervillain The Pharaoh to defeat the New Champions. CoreFire suddenly returns but is also unsuccessful against Dr. Impossible. Lily, who had quit the team earlier, eventually returns and defeats Dr. Impossible. Lily reveals that she is actually Erica Lowenstein, Dr. Impossible's childhood crush before his transformation and frequent kidnapee when she was the girlfriend of CoreFire. In the final chapter, Dr. Impossible ponders what it truly means to conquer the world, and whether such a feat can <b>really</b> <b>be</b> achieved, as he prepares for yet another escape from custody to start the cycle all over again with a new plan.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes in}} Chicago were mostly shot on location, as Bay {{believed}} the plates had to <b>really</b> <b>be</b> {{shot in the}} actual city. Farrar was always fascinated {{with the idea of}} shooting on location, and then blending the film with computer-generated imagery. The visual effects team used aerial plates of the city's actual buildings and added destruction elements such as smoke, fire, debris, fighter planes, war, battles, and torn up streets. Four ILM employees also travelled to Chicago and photographed buildings from top to bottom at six different times of the day {{in order to create a}} digital model of the city to be used in certain scenes. ILM's crew designed many major action scenes, with many of the Chicago battle concepts coming from the helicopter shooting of the aerial plates.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} {{called for}} the French and British to abandon the Antwerp–Namur line and strong positions in favour of improvised positions behind the Scheldt, without facing any real resistance. In the South, General Deffontaine of the Belgian VII Corps retreated from the Namur and Liège regions, the Liège fortress region put up stiff resistance to the German 6th Army. In the North, the 7th Army was diverted to Antwerp after the surrender of the Dutch on 15 May, but was then diverted to support the French 1st Army. In the centre, the Belgian Army and the BEF suffered little German pressure. On 15 May, the only sector to <b>really</b> <b>be</b> tested was around Leuven, which was held by the British 3rd Division. The BEF was not pursued vigorously to the Scheldt.|$|E

40|$|This paper takes {{a closer}} look at really in order to account for its various interpretations. Stenstrm's (1986) work on really forms the starting-point for the investigation. The {{following}} examples are from Stenstrm (1986 : 151), where she claims that the different readings of <b>really</b> <b>are</b> due to position and syntactic function: (1) this question <b>is</b> <b>really</b> surprising (2) this <b>is</b> a <b>really</b> surprising question (3) this <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a surprising question (4) this <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a surprising question (5) <b>really</b> this <b>is</b> a surprising question Stenstrm states that when <b>really</b> <b>is</b> placed next to the adjective, as in (1) and (2), it is a degree modifier which serves as an intensifier of surprising. But, the further <b>really</b> <b>is</b> moved to the left, the less is the emphasis on surprising and the more it is on the whole a surprising question. When <b>really</b> <b>is</b> placed in initial position, as in (5), it no longer intensifies a single clause element but is a comment on the whole proposition. Stenstrm remains vague about the intermediate positions and about the more exact interaction between syntactic position and interpretation. She concludes that what finally decides the function of <b>really</b> <b>is</b> the combined effect of position, prosody and the wider context. In contrast to Stenstrm, I propose that the motivating factors for the readings are semantic/pragmatic in nature rather than syntactic/positiona...|$|R

These three reaction mechanisms can <b>really</b> <b>be</b> split into two pathways of peroxyacid attack - on either the oxygen or the carbon of the carbonyl group. Attack on oxygen could lead to two possible intermediates: Baeyer and Villiger suggested a dioxirane intermediate, while Georg Wittig and Gustav Pieper suggested a peroxide with no dioxirane formation. Carbon attack was suggested by Rudolf Criegee. In this pathway, the peracid attacks the carbonyl carbon, producing what {{is now known as}} the Criegee intermediate.|$|E
25|$|Gluck {{had long}} pondered the {{fundamental}} problem of form and content in opera. He thought both of the main Italian operatic genres – opera buffa and opera seria – had strayed too far from what opera should <b>really</b> <b>be</b> and seemed unnatural. Opera buffa had long lost its original freshness. Its jokes were threadbare and the repetition of the same characters made them seem no more than stereotypes. In opera seria the singing was devoted to superficial effects and the content was uninteresting and fossilised. As in opera buffa, the singers were effectively absolute masters of the stage and the music, decorating the vocal lines so floridly that audiences could no longer recognise the original melody. Gluck wanted to return opera to its origins, focusing on human drama and passions and making words and music of equal importance.|$|E

He rebutted charges by SALT II critics that the United States had underestimated the Soviet military buildup, that the treaty would weaken the Western alliance, that the Soviet Union could not be trusted to obey the treaty, and that its terms could not <b>really</b> <b>be</b> verified. Partly to placate Senate opponents of the treaty, the Carter administration agreed in the fall of 1979 to support higher increases in the defense budget. However, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 ensured that the Senate would not accept the treaty at that time, forcing the president to withdraw it from consideration. When his term ended in 1981, Brown said that failure to secure ratification of SALT II was his greatest regret.|$|E
25|$|Some questionnaires, {{such as the}} Religious Orientation Scale, {{relate to}} {{different}} religious orientations, such as intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness, referring to different motivations for religious allegiance. A rather different approach, taken, for example, by Glock and Stark (1965), has been to list different dimensions of religion rather than different religious orientations, which relates to how an individual may manifest different forms of being religious. Glock and Stark's famous typology described five dimensions of religion – the doctrinal, the intellectual, the ethical-consequential, the ritual, and the experiential. In later work these authors subdivided the ritual dimension into devotional and public ritual, and also clarified that their distinction of religion along multiple dimensions was not identical to distinguishing religious orientations. Although some psychologists of religion have found it helpful to take a multidimensional approach to religion {{for the purpose of}} psychometric scale design, there has been, as Wulff (1997) explains, considerable controversy about whether religion should <b>really</b> <b>be</b> seen as multidimensional.|$|E
