5000|$|... 'Rack rate' is {{the travel}} {{industry}} term for the published full price of a hotel room, which the customer would pay by just walking into the hotel {{off the street and}} asking for a room. In some jurisdictions, a customer may be entitled to overstay a reservation by paying the <b>rack</b> <b>rate.</b> While lower than the maximum rate that the hotel may be allowed to charge under local laws, it is higher than the rate most travel agents can book for their customers. Sometimes the terms [...] "run of the house" [...] or [...] "walk-up rate" [...] are used to refer to the same highest rate.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study of room rate pricing in the Irish hotel industry. The paper views pricing as a social and {{organisational}} practice embedded in the contextual setting of each hotel. An interpretivist research methodology was chosen and actioned using qualitative interviewing and case studies. Two contrasting major case studies provided insights into the practice of room pricing. A five-level institutional explanation/model, which connects micro- and macro-levels, is proposed, using Old Institutional Economic (OIE) and New Institutional Sociology (NIS) concepts. The findings suggest that room pricing {{is a function of}} context, cannot be subject to general rules and is path-dependent on a continuum between floor price and ceiling <b>rack</b> <b>rate.</b> Hoteliers wish to move the room rate along the continuum towards the <b>rack</b> <b>rate,</b> but face conflicting forces at macro- and micro-levels, yielding tradeoffs and extensive complexity...|$|E
50|$|Although {{the state}} remains a major influence, Jordan’s media sector has seen {{significant}} privatisation and liberalisation efforts in recent years. Based on official <b>rack</b> <b>rates,</b> research firm Ipsos {{estimated that the}} advertisement sector spent some $280m towards publicity in Jordan’s media, 80% of which was spent on newspapers, followed by TV, radio and magazines. The biggest event of 2007 was the cancelled launch of ATV, the kingdom’s first private broadcaster. As a result, the state-owned Jordan TV (JTV) remains the country’s sole broadcaster. In recent years, Jordan has also seen a spectacular {{rise in the number}} of blogs, websites and news portals as sources of news information. The increasing diversification of Jordan’s media is a good sign and should boost advertising revenues and private initiatives.|$|R
50|$|Racks, {{especially}} two-post racks, {{are often}} secured {{to the floor}} or adjacent building structure {{so as not to}} fall over. This is usually required by local building codes in seismic zones. According to Telcordia Technologies Generic Requirements document GR-63-CORE, during an earthquake, telecommunications equipment is subjected to motions that can over-stress equipment framework, circuit boards, and connectors. The amount of motion and resulting stress depends on the structural characteristics of the building and framework in which the equipment is contained, and the severity of the earthquake. Seismic <b>racks</b> <b>rated</b> according to GR-63, NEBS Requirements: Physical Protection, are available, with Zone 4 representing the most demanding environment.GR-3108, Generic Requirements for Network Equipment in the Outside Plant (OSP), specifies the usable opening of seismic-compliant 19-inch racks.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper was to; identify and analyse the Internet behavioural processes of Irish tourism consumers, propose a search engine optimisation strategy if standardised behavioural patterns are observed thus reducing the commission paid to travel intermediaries, identify and analyse the implications of Irish tourism providers’ online strategies including the financial cost of the industry’s current Internet positioning strategies and assess if a disintermediation strategy is financially viable to the Irish hospitality industry. Quantitative data was gathered from three main groups. 100 online consumers were mapped using observation of their pre-determined offline tourism decisions and their acceptance & adoption of the Internet medium. 304 offline consumers were interviewed examining the control factors of their online search & decisions and 100 General managers / proprietors in the accommodation industry were interviewed by phone and questioned {{in relation to their}} control factors of the Irish e-tourism industry. The research was gathered in an attempt to quantify the cost of intermediation to the Irish tourism industry and to access if this cost created added value or was an unnecessary expense. As well as estimating the total spend by the hospitality industry on travel intermediaries, the research noted some interesting observations. Individual consumers searching directly for particular hotels, who would normally pay near <b>rack</b> <b>rate,</b> were finding intermediaries and incorrectly identifying them as the actual hotel, thus the hotel was paying commission because the consumer found the intermediary and not the hotel. The accommodation providers interviewed, on average dramatically underestimated the number of intermediaries selling their rooms. Some accommodation providers were unaware of the intermediation commission rate they were paying and were incorrect in identifying whether they or an intermediary were selling their room cheaper online. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} uses of flash deals or daily deals {{have caught}} the attention of many restaurant and hotel firms, as well as third-party distributors, such as Expedia. A survey of nearly 200 international hospitality practitioners found that a remarkable 42 percent had tested a flash deal promotion, and some of those firms had offered numerous flash deals. At the same time, 46 percent of the responding hospitality firms had no intention of offering a flash deal, with some citing concerns about the potential damage of group discounts to brand integrity. Individual hotels that had offered flash deals tended to be on the large side, averaging more than 150 rooms. Discounts offered in the deals ranged widely, from 15 to over 75 percent off <b>rack</b> <b>rates.</b> Likewise, commissions paid to deal vendors saw a wide range, as the most typical commission was 15 to 20 percent, but some hotels paid as much as a 40 -percent commission. Most of the deals reported in this survey had been offered through Groupon or LivingSocial, but Jetsetter unexpectedly appeared as the number-three flash-deal channel for these respondents. Deal structures also varied widely, although many deals were offered for mid-week. Although most offers involve a non-refundable purchase, deal vendors are increasingly offering their customers opportunities to obtain refunds in certain circumstances. Respondents’ general assessment of the deals’ success was moderate. They agreed that their deals brought in new customers, but repeat business was more tenuous. One favorable outcome was that the respondents saw little evidence of cannibalization of existing business, particularly when they packaged their deal carefully. On balance, hoteliers who were most pleased with the outcome of their deals were also the ones who managed the cost of the deal most assertively...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of bike parking facilities {{has been shown}} {{to play a role in}} improving bike ridership. People are more likely to commute by bike if there are secure and well-located bike racks available. Within the last 5 years, the University of North Texas has made a concerted effort to improve the availability of bike parking for cyclists to encourage cycling as a commute mode. However, the placement of racks around campus has been based on perceived needs rather than documented patterns. The goal of our project is to document the occupancy <b>rate</b> of bike <b>racks</b> across campus to identify areas that were underserved. We also examined how rack installation practices affected the maximum capacity of the <b>racks</b> and occupancy <b>rates.</b> We found that overall the campus had a sufficient number of racks. However, a few areas on campus were underserviced, while in other areas, the racks were not being utilized. These patterns of use were linked to the types of buildings the racks were associated with, as well as where racks were placed and installed. The findings will allow the university to better plan where to target resources...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} fatigue related {{issues in the}} field of railway mechanics. In {{particular}} rail breaks and deterioration of insulating joints are investigated. The study is largely motivated by plans to increase allowed axle loads in Sweden. The aim is to deliver operational results, as well as exemplify how practical problems in railway mechanics can be assessed by computer based simulations. In the first appended paper the influence of wheel flat impacts on the growth of rail cracks and subsequent rail breaks is analyzed. This calls for an analysis of the dynamic train [...] track interaction combined with a fracture mechanics analysis of crack growth and fracture. To account for high frequency excitations due to wheel flat impacts the in-house code DIFF is employed for the analysis of train [...] track interaction. Stress intensity factors for rail cracks are derived using FE-simulations. Added loading due to restricted thermal contraction of all-welded rails is included. Risks of rail breaks for specified crack sizes and temperatures are evaluated as functions of impact load magnitudes. In addition crack growth rates are quantified. Simulation results indicate that wheel flats increase the risk of rail breaks, but have a limited influence on <b>rack</b> growth <b>rates.</b> The latter is due to the infrequent occurrence of wheel flats and the fact that these need to impact in a rather narrow region to cause any considerable influence on the crack growth rate. In the second paper deterioration of insulated joints is analyzed by 3 D FE-simulations. Repeated negotiations of a loaded wheel over an insulating joint is simulated. To obtain realistic material responses, an advanced constitutive model is employed. The simulations indicate the accumulated strain (ratcheting) to be the dominant damage mechanism. In a parametric study the influence of insulating gap, axel load, frictional force, and coefficient of maximum friction in the wheel [...] rail interface is assessed. In particular the frictional force (traction/braking) is found to have a major influence on joint deterioration. A limited field study has been carried out and provided some qualitative confirmation of the simulations...|$|R

40|$|With the aim {{to achieve}} a better {{understanding}} of the time-dependent behaviour of structured clays, especially cemented clay, a critical review of the literature and a programme of laboratory testing have been carried out. In order to investigate the time effects on different structured clays, a series of advanced triaxial and oedometer tests were conducted on reconstituted pure kaolin (PK), artificially cemented kaolin (ACK) with different curing periods, and remoulded artificially cemented kaolin (<b>RACK).</b> Strain <b>rate</b> effects were examined in pure kaolin with different degrees of over-consolidation in both undrained and drained shearing. The influence of bond structure on the monotonic stress-strain behaviour of cemented kaolin was investigated on specimens prepared with two different curing stress and curing periods. Tests on pure kaolin and remoulded cemented kaolin were also performed. Strain rate effects on long cured cemented kaolin under low and high confining stresses, with constant rate of straining in pre-peak stage and step-wise change rate of straining in post-peak stage were examined. This was completed by a study of the microstructure of pure kaolin and cemented kaolin specimens before and after tests via scanning electronic microscope. The coupling between stress or strain rate and curing time effects was investigated on cemented kaolin cured for shorter periods. The results have added significant data to the existing database and addressed the relationship between bond structure and time effect. The main conclusions are: ••The viscous type of PK determined is characterized as decaying positive isotache and General TESRA in undrained and drained shearing repectively. The strain rate history does not affect the critical state in both q-p’ and v-ln p’ spaces. ••The addition of cement not only creates new inter-particle bonds but also affects new fabric. The shear strength is dominated by bond structure under low confining stress, and by volume change under high confining stress. ••The viscous type of long-term cured ACK is dependent on the degree of bond structure. It is almost insensitive to strain rate changes when the specimen is stiff, and the apparent “aging” effect dominates resulting in a “negative” rate effect when bond structure is destroyed. A special rate phenomenon called stick-slip seems to occur under the lowest strain rate (0. 01 %/h) during the pre-peak stage. The RACK shows a TESRA type of viscosity in undrained shearing. ••The short-term cured ACK, in which structuring and rate effects are combined, shows negative rate effects due to the curing under low confining stress and apparent aging under high confining stress. Stick-slip occurs both in pre-peak and post-peak stages, due to different reasons. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
