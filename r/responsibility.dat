There were 25tropical depressions, one {{short of the}} record set in 1982, which had 26. Only one storm formed in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's (CPHC) area of <b>responsibility,</b> Tropical Depression One-C.

An average number(3) of major hurricanes– Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale– was also reported.|$|E
5|$|Denial of <b>responsibility</b> via {{language}} that obscures awareness of personal <b>responsibility.</b> It {{is said that}} we deny <b>responsibility</b> for our actions when we attribute their cause to: vague impersonal forces ("I had to"); our condition, diagnosis, personal or psychological history; the actions of others; the dictates of authority; group pressure; institutional policy, rules, and regulations; gender roles, social roles, or age roles; or uncontrollable impulses.|$|E

30|$|The {{overall picture}} from the {{empirical}} data {{is that there}} is clear agreement that legal <b>responsibilities</b> come before economic <b>responsibilities.</b> No sub-section of the sample thought that economic <b>responsibilities</b> came first (although for Indian respondents economic <b>responsibilities</b> tied with legal <b>responsibilities).</b> Legal <b>responsibilities</b> came first overall and joint first with ethical <b>responsibilities</b> for US respondents and female respondents. However those who believed the legal system was inadequate to protect public welfare (n[*]=[*] 64) ranked ethical <b>responsibilities</b> first and significantly higher than legal <b>responsibilities,</b> which is consistent with the proposal that ethical <b>responsibilities</b> will be deemed to be more important than legal <b>responsibilities</b> when the legal system is not trusted to protect public welfare.|$|R

Several actors share some of the <b>responsibilities.</b> One can think of <b>responsibilities</b> for information, for financing, and for being aware of vulnerabilities and other obstacles.

30|$|The International Pyramid {{model of}} CSR {{suggests}} that {{legal and ethical}} <b>responsibilities</b> {{are the focus of}} social resistance to many commercial projects in developed, developing, and emerging/transitional economies, and may, in fact, be the deciding factor in debating the contribution of the economic, business, government, and civil society collaboration to sustainable development. The International Pyramid allows for the legal and ethical <b>responsibilities</b> to be considered in a different way, such that the business can work to meet the lower-level <b>responsibilities</b> that obligate it to shareholders and the law, and can simultaneously move on to the higher-level <b>responsibilities</b> of the company that have long-term future benefit for society. This gets around the problem found in some countries {{by the fact that the}} legal and ethical environment is not always sufficiently comprehensive and hence, enforcement may be weakened. The outcome of this lack of development is that certain environmental <b>responsibilities</b> may not be properly covered within legal and ethical <b>responsibilities.</b> Consequently, the main difference between philanthropic <b>responsibilities,</b> and legal and ethical <b>responsibilities,</b> can be seen in what is mandated and what is not. Regulatory and enforcement issues are concerned with legal and even some ethical <b>responsibilities,</b> while philanthropic components are not.|$|R
30|$|The International Pyramid {{allows for}} the legal and ethical <b>responsibilities</b> to assume greater or lesser importance, being {{represented}} by either the third or the fourth tier, or even climbing to become the highest CSR priority. This degree of flexibility follows from Visser’s (2006) suggestion that ethical and legal <b>responsibilities</b> in Africa remain the lowest CSR priorities since there are poorly-developed legal infrastructures in African countries. Similarly, ethical <b>responsibilities</b> are {{claimed to be a}} higher priority in Europe than in the US (Crane and Matten 2007 a, 2007 b). Furthermore, the fact that in Carroll (1991) Pyramid Model, the legal <b>responsibilities</b> are located in the second row and follow by ethical <b>responsibilities,</b> indicates the belief that US companies are more interested in discharging their legal and ethical <b>responsibilities</b> rather than the discretionary ones. Later research, however, suggests that legal and ethical <b>responsibilities</b> are more primary (Sachs and Ruehle, 2009; Pedersen, 2010, Baden, 2016), and certainly, French and German consumers tended to rate legal and ethical <b>responsibilities</b> of primary importance (Maignan, 2001).|$|R
