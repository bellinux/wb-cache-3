40|$|The {{horizontal}} direct chill (HDC) {{casting process}} has been investigated as a production route for magnesium <b>remelt</b> <b>ingot.</b> During this development program, HDC ingots of AZ 91 were cast at two pilot plants. Ingots cast at one site exhibited columnar microstructures and were prone to formation of centreline cracks, whereas ingots cast at the other site had equiaxed microstructures and did not crack. In order to determine whether differences in the casting conditions or the melt preparation practices at the two sites {{were responsible for the}} change in the microstructure, available models of the columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) were applied. Ingot microstructures were examined and thermal data were obtained. CAFE (cellular automata finite element) modelling using the CalcoMOSTM program was also used to predict grain structures. Results showed that while increased casting temperatures can contribute to a slightly increased tendency toward formation of columnar grain structures, a change in the concentration of nuclei is a more likely cause...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we will discuss}} {{some of the early}} {{pioneering}} work {{as well as some of}} our more recent research. The Albany Research Center (ARC) has been involved with the melting and processing of metals since it was established in 1942. In the early days, hardly anything was known about melting refractory or reactive metals and as such, virtually everything had to be developed in-house. Besides the more common induction heated air-melt furnaces, ARC has built and/or utilized a wide variety of furnaces including vacuum arc <b>remelt</b> <b>ingot</b> and casting furnaces, cold wall induction furnaces, electric arc furnaces, cupola furnaces and reverberatory furnaces. The melt size of these furnaces range from several grams to a ton or more. We have used these furnaces to formulate custom alloys for wrought applications as well as for such casting techniques as spin casting, investment casting and lost foam casting among many. Two early spin-off industrializations were Wah Chang (wrought zirconium alloys for military and commercial nuclear applications) and Oremet (both wrought and cast Ti). Both of these companies are now part of the ATI Allegheny Ludlum Corporation...|$|E

30|$|During the {{processing}} of solute rich alloys, macrosegregation defects can result from the solidification step [4]. These defects are characterized by composition differences in the space domain {{on the scale of}} the product, which deteriorates the properties of the material. These defects were observed in various solidification processes, including forge <b>ingots,</b> vacuum arc <b>remelted</b> <b>ingots,</b> and directionally solidified turbine blades. The improvement of such macrosegregation is a central problem in the solidification process. In this paper, we clarify (a) how the fluid flow in the mushy zone transports the solute and generates the segregations; and (b) whether it is possible to control the fluid flow by means of an electromagnetic stirring device to avoid segregations.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the thermodynamic conditions of the manufacture by electroslag remelting (ESR) of microalloyed steels with two precipitating metal elements. Two steels containing vanadium and titanium and another steel containing niobium and titanium were manufactured from commercial medium and high carbon steels. The deoxidant used was Ca-Si, and a study was made of the thermodynamic equilibrium between the metal and the slag which concluded that deoxidation is preferentially achieved by calcium and aluminium. An analysis was made of the most frequent inclusions in the <b>remelted</b> <b>ingots.</b> The dissolution temperatures of the precipitates have been determined and, as a consequence of this, the minimum reheating temperature has been established for each steel, facilitating its subsequent thermomechanical treatment.

40|$|The {{aluminium}} industry is reducing its {{carbon dioxide emissions}} and environmental footprint. In order to identify and prioritise areas in the cast house where greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced {{it is necessary to}} quantify CO 2 e (CO 2 equivalent tonnes) emissions for the various cast house operations. In this study two typical cast house layouts are examined. In one case, 22 kg 99. 85 % aluminium <b>remelt</b> <b>ingots</b> are produced using chain conveyor ingot casting machines. In the second case, wrought alloy extrusion and rolling slab direct chill cast products are made. Both plants are sized at 500 ktpa. The various process inputs in terms of energy and materials were identified and typical usage rates assigned. The results show that general electricity consumption, dross generation and furnace energy consumption are the three biggest areas of CO 2 e and should be targeted for improvement.

40|$|In this study, the key {{technologies}} of a 6 -m long bearing steel ingot produced by electroslag remelting withdrawing (ESRW) process, including bifilar mode supply, slag system development, {{and design of}} mold, were studied based on the laboratory research achievements. The 6 -m long ingot of bearing steel GGr 15 with a cross-section of 300 mm × 340 mm was produced using the ESRW process with a bifilar mode and a multi-taper T-mold in a plant. The testing {{results show that the}} melting rate using the ESRW bifilar mode technology is three times faster than traditional electroslag remelting (ESR), and the power consumption is only 1, 320 kWh per ton steel.

40|$|Alloys of {{titanium}} with {{refractory metals}} are attractive materials for applications requiring {{high temperature strength}} and corrosion resistance. However, the widely different characteristics of the component elements have {{made it difficult to}} produce sound, compositionally homogeneous ingots using traditional melting techniques. This is particularly critical because the compositional ranges spanned by the micro- and macrosegregation in theses systems can easily encompass a number of microconstituents which are detrimental to mechanical properties. This paper presents results of a study of plasma (PAM) and vacuum-arc (VAR) melting of a 60 wt% tantalum, 40 wt% titanium binary alloy. The structural and compositional homogeneity of both PAM consolidated + PAM remelted, and PAM consolidated + VAR <b>remelted</b> <b>ingots</b> were characterized and compared using optical and electron microscopy and x-ray fluorescence microanalysis. Additionally, the effect of melting parameter, including melt rate and magnetic stirring, was studied. Results indicate that PAM remelting achieves more complete dissolution of lie starting electrode, due to greater local superheat, than does VAR remelting. PAM remelting also produces a finer as-solidified grain structure, due to the smaller molten pool and lower local solidification times. Conversely, VAR <b>remelting</b> produces an <b>ingot</b> with a more uniform macrostructure, due to the more stable movement of the solidification interface and more uniform material feed rate. Based on these results, a three-step process of PAM consolidation, followed by a PAM intermediate melt and a VAR final melt, has been selected for further development of the alloy and processing sequence...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of modified NIMONIC 115 and UDIMET 720 with reduced levels of cobalt were evaluated. Vacuum induction melted and vacuum arc <b>remelted</b> <b>ingots</b> were hot rolled to 3 / 4 inch diameter bar. Hot workability was evaluated {{in terms of}} the ingot rolling behavior and the hot ductility of the as-rolled bar. Variations in workability and bar ductility were correlated to variations in incipient melting temperature and gamma prime solvus, both of which varied with cobalt content. Heat treatments were defined to yield, as far as possible, similar structures from alloy to alloy. At the lowest cobalt levels N- 115 workability was severely limited and the alloys could not be worked to bar. It is suggested that incipient melting in combination with heavy grain boundary carbide precipitation reduced ingot workability. Final heat treatment of modified alloys was difficult in the situation where the gamma prime solvus temperature was close to the incipient melting point, indicating that it may not be feasible to fully solution low cobalt alloys to obtain the large grain size required for optimum creep resistance...|$|R

Further, boride modified alloys are found to have finer grains in as-cast as well as in hot-rolled and annealed conditions. In the annealed condition, boride containing alloys were found to have superior tensile yield strength, ductility and strain hardening behaviour.

40|$|Co-Al-W alloys {{strengthened}} {{with the}} L 12 gamma-prime phase have promise as next generation high temperature materials {{due to the}} ability to engineer a high gamma-prime content alloy with a higher gamma-prime solvus and higher melting point than many Ni-base gamma-prime strengthened alloys. Furthermore, these Co-Al-W gamma-prime alloys are interesting as potential cast-and-wrought alloys because they have a relatively narrow range of solidification temperature and large range of temperature between the gamma-prime solvus and the solidus, suggesting than manufacturing via an ingot metallurgy route would be feasible. However, since J. Sato et al discovered gamma-prime in the Co-Al-W alloy system in 2006, the focus in the literature has been on characterizing the structure and properties of these alloys and measuring and assessing the thermodynamics of the alloy system primarily for application as castings for turbine blade applications. To date the author is not aware of any publications describing the microstructure of vacuum induction melted, vacuum arc <b>remelted</b> <b>ingots</b> of a size more than about 2 kg. Most work has been performed using small, laboratory-scale, cast-and-hot-rolled samples or samples cast as single crystals. This paper presents ATI's experience in assessing the feasibility of manufacturing a cast-and-wrought billet product in the Co-Al-W-X alloy system. Three 22 [*]kg heats were produced to examine a small range of alloy compositions of potential commercial interest: Co- 9 Al- 9 W, Co- 9 Al- 10 W- 2 Ti, and Co- 9 Al- 10 W- 2 Ti- 0. 02 B, respectively.

40|$|The final {{solidification}} {{structures of}} Vacuum Arc <b>Remelting</b> (VAR) <b>ingots</b> {{depend on the}} temperature distribution and fluid motion within the molten pool. In this paper, a three-dimensional multi-physics macroscale model for VAR is developed, based on the modular CFD software PHYSICA. This model is used to provide estimates of process parameters and to study complex physical phenomena, such as liquid metal flow with turbulence, heat transfer, solidification, and magnetohydrodynamics in the VAR process. The macromodel is coupled to a microscale solidification model. The micromodel combines stochastic nucleation and a modified decentred square/octahedron method to describe dendritic growth with a finite difference computation of solute diffusion. The resulting multiscale model allows prediction {{of the formation of}} microstructures in the solidifying mushy zone.

40|$|Attempts {{were made}} to produce directionally solidified, {{specifically}} grain aligned Al- 6 wt pct Ni eutectic alloy using a laboratory scale ESR unit. For this purpose sand cast alloy electrodes were electroslag remelted under different mold conditions. The grain structure of the ingots obtained from these meltings showed that insulated silica molds gave the best vertical alignment of grains {{along the length of}} the ingot. The NiAl 3 fibers within the grains tended to fan out and there was only a preferred alignment of fibers along the growth direction under the conditions of our experiments. The ESR parameters most suitable for vertical alignment of eutectic grains have been identified. In some electroslag <b>remelting</b> trials <b>ingots</b> were grown on a seed ingot. This resulted in a fewer vertical grains compared to the case when no seed ingot was used. The sand cast specimen of the eutectic exhibited a maximum tensile strength of around 88. 2 MN/m 2 (9. 0 kg/mm 2) whereas conventional ESR using water cooled mold gave strength value of 98. 0 MN/m 2 (10 kg/mm 2). The directionally solidified ESR material showed longitudinal tensile strength as high as 213. 7 MN/m 2 (21. 8 kg/mm 2) which could be further increased to 220. 6 MN/m 2 (22. 5 kg/mm 2) by using the seed ingot.

40|$|In {{the past}} {{research}} on bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) has been concentrated on searching for alloy composition to obtain high glass forming ability. Very few studies {{are on the}} effect of processing condition on glass forming ability of BMGs. In this study, we have prepared CuZr-based BMGs at different casting temperatures. Increasing casting temperature increases glass forming ability and decreases the amount of the crystalline phase during BMG solidification. At a high casting temperature 1723 K, fully amorphous sample is obtained at a size of 2 mm in diameter. While under the lower casting temperatures (1523 K and 1323 K), crystalline CuZr phases exist. The formation of the crystalline phase is attributed to the initial crystals or cluster survived in the BMG melt during <b>ingot</b> <b>remelting.</b> The study indicates that casting temperature can be used as the controlling parameter to produce purely amorphous materials or crystalline CuZr-phase reinforced BMG composites, and the mechanical properties and thermal stability of the BMG composites can be tailored by the amount of the crystalline phase existed in the materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{fluoride}} inclusions on {{the properties of}} titanium produced from the Bureau of Mines developed induction slag melting process is of concern {{to members of the}} titanium industry. The objective of the research was to determine the effect of CaF 2 inclusions on the properties of titanium and its survival rate during melting. The data were obtained from single induction-slag-melted ingots prepared with the normal addition of 4 pct and also with 2 - and 1 -pct additions of CaF 2 slag. The results of this effort showed that the mechanical properties of single-induction-slag-melted Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy exceed the minimum values specified in Aerospace Materials Specification for Titanium Alloy Bars and Forgings AMS 4928 H, but these materials are much more notch sensitive in fatigue than normal Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V alloy titanium.

40|$|Double vacuum arc <b>remelted</b> NiTi <b>ingots</b> were vacuum {{induction}} remelted and subsequently atomized using a high-pressure gas stream. Powders were collected, loaded into cans, and hot isostatically pressed (HIP'ed). Prior to HIP'ing, powders of various known transformation temperatures (As), were precisely blended {{to achieve a}} desired intermediate transformation temperature (As). This intermediate As follows an empirical relationship which approximates a rule of mixtures based on weight fraction. As were measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Results for HIP'ed and high temperature annealed specimens indicate that this technique was accurate and reproducible for measuring the transformation temperature of smooth, nearly symmetrical DSC curves. DSC/DTA thermograms in the literature typically show a double peak exothermic-martensitic reaction which was different than the smooth peaks observed for the HIP'ed condition. The specific thermomechanical history performed on the P/M material resulted in the double peak exothermic reaction. To interpret the peaks, thermal arrest experiments were conducted on both exothermic peaks, the results of which clearly support {{the existence of a}} premartensitic reaction. Thermal arrest experiments were also performed to analyze incomplete thermal cycles on both heating and cooling. Thermal arrest of the martensite reaction resulted in reduced energy absorbed for completion of the austenite reaction. Conversely, martensite energy was reduced by an arrest of the austenite reaction. However, reheating the sample revealed that the arrest split the austenite reaction into two distinct peaks, the split occurring at the temperature of the prior thermal arrest. These results and results of additional DSC experiments serve to emphasize the influence of thermomechanical history on the kinetics and energetics of the SME transformation. The P/M blending process technique was found to result in unprecedented control of the As temperature. Scientific/engineering considerations justify P/M processing and mechanical blending as opposed to conventional cast/wrought processing to achieve accurate As temperatures...|$|R
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{requirements}} for mechanical properties and service life above 650 °C, a high-Mn austenitic hot work die steel, instead of traditional martensitic hot work die steel such as H 13, {{was developed in the}} present study. The effect of heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the newly developed work die steel was studied. The results show that the microstructure of the high-Mn as-cast electroslag <b>remelting</b> (ESR) <b>ingot</b> is composed of γ-Fe, V(C,N), and Mo 2 C. V(C,N) is an irregular multilateral strip or slice shape with severe angles. Most eutectic Mo 2 C carbides are lamellar fish-skeleton-like, except for a few that are rod-shaped. With increasing solid solution time and temperature, the increased hardness caused by solid solution strengthening exceeds the effect of decreased hardness caused by grain size growth, but this trend is reversed later. As a result, the hardness of specimens after various solid solution heat treatments increases first and then decreases. The optimal combination of hardness and austenitic grain size can be obtained by soaking for 2 h at 1170 °C. The maximum Rockwell hardness (HRC) is 47. 24 HRC, and the corresponding austenite average grain size is 58. 4 μm. When the solid solution time is 3 h at 1230 °C, bimodality presented in the histogram of the austenite grain size as a result of further progress in secondary recrystallization. Compared with the single-stage aging, the maximum impact energy of the specimen after two-stage aging heat treatment was reached at 16. 2 J and increased by 29. 6 %, while the hardness decreased by 1 – 2 HRC. After two-stage aging heat treatment, the hardness of steel reached {{the requirements}} of superior grade H 13, and the maximum impact energy was 19. 6 % higher than that of superior grade H 13, as specified in NADCA# 207 - 2003...|$|R
40|$|Electroslag <b>remelted</b> (ESR) <b>ingots</b> of INCOLOY alloys 800 and 825 are {{particularly}} prone to macroscale slag inclusions and microscale cleanliness issues. Formation of these structures near the ingot surface can cause significant production yield losses (∼ 10 %) {{due to the}} necessity of extensive surface grinding. Slag inclusions from near the outer radius of the toe end of alloy 800 and 825 ingots {{were found to be}} approximately 1 to 3 mm in size and have a multiphase microstructure consisting of CaF 2, CaTiO 3, MgAl 2 O 4, MgO and some combination of Ca 12 Al 14 O 32 F 2 and/or Ca 12 Al 14 O 33. These inclusions were often surrounded by fields of 1 to 10 μm cuboidal TiN particles. A large number of TiN cuboids were observed in the ESR electrode with similar size and morphology to those observed surrounding slag inclusions in the ESR ingots, suggesting that the TiN particles are relics from ESR electrode production process. Samples taken sequentially throughout the EAF-AOD processes showed that the TiN cuboidals that are found in ESR ingots form between tapping the AOD vessel into the AOD ladle and the casting of ESR electrodes. ^ Analysis of slag skin at various heights of alloy 825 ingots revealed that the phase fraction of CaF 2 decreased, whereas TiCaO 3 and Ca 12 Al 14 O 32 F 2 increased, from toe to head. The observed increase in TiO 2 content suggests that at most a two-fold increase in viscosity of the slag would be expected. Similar analysis of alloy 800 ingots did not reveal significant trends in slag skin composition, possibly due to differences in ingot geometry or the presence of Al toe additions during the remelting of alloy 800. Directional solidification experiments were conducted to determine the solidification sequences of two common ESR slags: Code 316 (33 % CaF 2, 33 % CaO, and 33 % Al 2 O 3) and Code 59 (50 % CaF 2, 20 % CaO, 22 % Al 2 O 3, 5 % MgO, and 3 % TiO 2). In both cases the changes in slag phase fraction as a function of solidification time were not as significant as predicted. This suggests substantial solute concentrations within each phase, significant gas phase reactions or insufficient imposed temperature gradient for directional planer solidification. Optical microscopy and SEM analysis revealed a dendritic structure with Ca 12 Al 14 O 32 F 2 as the primary phase and significant interdendritic porosity. EDS analysis showed that Al segregates to the primary phase while F segregates to the interdendritic regions. Parametric studies using a numerical model of ESR suggests that the ESR process is quite sensitive to changes in slag electrical conductivity and not very sensitive to changes in slag viscosity. ...|$|R
