5|$|The en passant capture {{rule was}} {{added in the}} 15th century when the rule that gave pawns an initial double-step move was introduced. It {{prevents}} a pawn from using the two-square advance to pass an adjacent enemy pawn without the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> captured.|$|E
5|$|FreeFall Stage {{discouraged}} {{people under the}} age of fifteen from attending because of {{the subject matter of the}} play, but encouraged older teenagers to attend because teenagers are at the greatest <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> trafficked. Several human trafficking survivors attended the performances, and other survivors sent the Eldridges messages about their personal experiences with human trafficking. Quandt said that he encountered many audience members who, because of watching the play, became determined to do something to combat human trafficking.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, an {{increasing}} number of products used for everyday life proved to be poisonous. The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> poisoned nowadays lies more in the accidental factor, where poison be induced or taken by accident. Poisoning is the 4th most common cause of death within young people. Accidental ingestions are most common in children less than 5 years old.|$|E

Eliminating nearby nests or moving to areas with low Myrmecia populations significantly decreases the chances of getting stung.|$|E
5|$|Since 1999 the RAAF has put its Hornets {{through a}} series of {{upgrades}} to improve their effectiveness. However, the aircraft are becoming increasingly difficult to operate and are at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> outclassed by the fighters and air-defence systems operated by other countries. As a result, the RAAF will begin to retire its F/A-18s in the late 2010s, and the last aircraft will leave service in the early 2020s. Under current Australian Government planning they will be replaced by 72 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighters.|$|E

5|$|Although it was {{cut short}} by Roosevelt's desire to have him testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph. Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Ã‰amon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; because of the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> shot down by Nazi aircraft, the {{roundabout}} journey home took four days. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support was key to passing Lend-Lease.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{ran for the}} Canadian House of Commons in the 1988 federal election, {{appearing}} on the ballot as Steve Harper in Calgary West and losing {{by a wide margin}} to Hawkes, his former employer. After Reform candidate Deborah Grey was elected as the party's first MP in a 1989 by-election, Harper became Grey's executive assistant, and was her chief adviser and speechwriter until 1993. He remained prominent in the Reform Party's national organization in his role as policy chief, encouraging the party to expand beyond its Western base, and arguing that strictly regional parties were at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> taken over by radical elements. He delivered a speech at the Reform Party's 1991 national convention, in which he condemned extremist views.|$|E

5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E
5|$|In another study, Gregory S. Paul {{pointed out}} that the flexed kneed and digitigrade adult Tyrannosaurus were much better adapted for running than {{elephants}} or humans, pointing out that Tyrannosaurus had a large ilium bone and cnemial crest that would have supported large muscles needed for running. He also mentioned that Alexander's (1989) formula to calculate speed by bone strength was only partly reliable. He suggests that the formula is overly sensitive to bone length; making long bones artificially weak. He also {{pointed out that}} the lowered <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> wounded in combat may have been worth the risk of Tyrannosaurus falling while running.|$|E
5|$|In early 1859, {{abolitionist}} Republican U.S. Senator William H. Seward sold Tubman a {{small piece}} of land on the outskirts of Auburn, New York, for US$1,200. The city was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman seized the opportunity to deliver her parents from the harsh Canadian winters. Returning to the U.S. meant that escaped slaves were at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> returned to the south under the Fugitive Slave Law, and Tubman's siblings expressed reservations. Catherine Clinton suggests that anger over the 1857 Dred Scott decision may have prompted Tubman to return to the U.S. Her land in Auburn became a haven for Tubman's family and friends. For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for black Americans seeking a better life in the north.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{with severe}} mental illness, {{including}} schizophrenia, {{are at a}} significantly greater <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> victims of both violent and non-violent crime. Schizophrenia {{has been associated with}} a higher rate of violent acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse. Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region. What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{both the}} highest and lowest judges' scores are omitted to cancel out any discrepancy, giving a maximum of 60 style points. A perfect jump on a K200 hill would {{therefore}} garner a minimum of 180 points (120 distance points + 60 style points) or more, depending on bonus points. However, such a scenario is only an example and not representative of the highly variable nature of the sport. Gaining one or more scores of 20 is very rare, and five is extremely rare. Generally, a good to excellent jump {{can be expected to}} receive judges' scores of 18 to 19.5. While a lower score for style puts an athlete at the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> less competitive, this may be mitigated or even nullified if they have attained substantial bonus points for distance.|$|E
5|$|Tactically, {{the pass}} at Thermopylae was {{ideally suited to}} the Greek style of warfare. A hoplite phalanx could block the narrow pass with ease, with no <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> outflanked by cavalry. Moreover, in the pass, the phalanx {{would have been very}} {{difficult}} to assault for the more lightly armed Persian infantry. The major weak point for the Greeks was the mountain track which led across the highland parallel to Thermopylae, that could allow their position to be outflanked. Although probably unsuitable for cavalry, this path could easily be traversed by the Persian infantry (many of whom were versed in mountain warfare). Leonidas was made aware of this path by local people from Trachis, and he positioned a detachment of Phocian troops there in order to block this route.|$|E

50|$|Country hopping is {{not just}} {{restricted}} to one nationality or country.

25|$|The {{view that}} {{sexuality}} is victimization teaches girls {{to be careful}} <b>of</b> <b>being</b> sexually victimized and taken advantage of. Educators who hold this perspective encourage sexual education, but focus on teaching girls how to say no, teaching them <b>of</b> the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> victims and educate them about <b>risks</b> and diseases <b>of</b> <b>being</b> sexually active. This perspective teaches adolescents that boys are predators and that girls are victims of sexual victimization. Researchers state that this perspective {{does not address the}} existence of desire within girls, does not address the societal variables that influence sexual violence and teaches girls to view sex as dangerous only before marriage. In reality, sexual violence can be very prevalent within marriages too.|$|R
