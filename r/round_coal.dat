Whether we shall devise other means hereafter {{is a question of}} which I shall speak presently. Meanwhile, no man is to be blamed for the existence, hardly even for the evils, of great cities. The process of their growth has been very simple. They have gathered themselves round abbeys and castles, for the sake of protection; round courts, for the sake of law; round ports, for the sake of commerce; <b>round</b> <b>coal</b> mines, for the sake of manufacture.

There was also a Madeley Road station on the North Staffordshire Railway's branch line to Market Drayton which was opened on 1 February 1870 and closed in 1931. However, during the 1960s the Station at Madeley Road was reopened and used as a messroom by British Rail Traincrew and Shunters for running <b>Round</b> <b>Coal</b> Trains destined for Silverdale and Holditch Collieries. These Trains came off the West Coast Mainline and onto the former Branch via Madeley Chord. This arrangement continued until Silverdale Colliery closed in 1998.|$|E
50|$|Teams {{were then}} {{directed}} to travel by bus to Phố Vác and find Dinh Vác Temple. There, {{they found the}} Detour, a choice between Fuel and Fowl. In Fuel, teams had {{to travel to the}} home of Nguyĕn Văn Thuý and make 30 <b>round</b> <b>coal</b> bricks, a traditional Vietnamese fuel source, by putting wet coal in a traditional press. When they properly assembled all 30 bricks, a coal maker would give them their next clue. In Fowl, teams traveled to Nhà Thò where they had to use traditional local materials to build an intricate Vietnamese birdcage. When the birdcage was properly constructed, they would receive their next clue. These clues directed teams to travel by foot to the Pit Stop at the rice paddy in Canh Dong Dia.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the second}} level of a typical breaker, coal would be roughly sorted. The fuel would move over sorting bars, with the various sizes of coal going down {{different}} chutes. Each type of roughly sorted coal would next pass over a [...] "slate-picker screen" [...] (sometimes called a [...] "mud screen"), with the generally <b>round</b> <b>coal</b> falling through the screen and the flat slate passing over the screen to fall down a chute to the culm pile. Coal passing through the slate-picker screen would then be sorted by additional screens. Some of these second screens were composed of flat iron perforated by holes of larger size toward the rear (where the coal entered) and smaller holes toward the front. These flat screens were sometimes shaken back and forth (hence the name [...] "shaking screens"), which not only removed dirt and sulphur from the coal but broke down larger lumps of coal into smaller sizes and sorted it for further cleaning and processing. Other screens were cylindrical, making 10 revolutions per minute and performing the same function as shaking screen. Flat and cylindrical screens could be single-jacketed (a single screen) or double-jacketed (two screens, the first or inner screen having larger openings while the second screen had smaller ones).|$|E

50|$|India is {{the fifth}} largest {{consumer}} of primary energy and the third largest consumer {{of oil in the}} Asia-Pacific region after China and Japan. Due to high economic growth, there is a huge need for enhancing supply of energy resources. Also, dependence on imported petroleum continues to grow and is ultimately impacting the country’s long term growth. Of the 26 sedimentary basins identified in India, so far, only 20% of the total area has been well explored. The remaining areas need to be extensively explored with the best of technologies, with special emphasis on the frontier basins. With the introduction of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), the introduction of much-needed capital and state-of-the-art technology to explore the sector could be made possible. With the policies and regulations being some of the most transparent in the world, the NELP has revived a healthy spirit of competition between National Oil Companies and private and multinational companies. The development of the exploration sector has been significantly boosted through this policy, which brought major liberalization in the sector and created pathways for private and foreign investment, where 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is allowed. Under NELP, which became effective in February 1999, the process of competitive bidding is followed wherein acreages are offered to the participating companies. By mid-2012, the ninth round of bidding has been concluded along with fourth <b>round</b> for <b>Coal</b> Bed Methane (CBM) blocks. The Government of India offered the highest ever number of 70 oil & gas exploration blocks covering an area of about 1,63,535 km². and also making a parallel offer of 10 blocks under the fourth <b>round</b> of <b>Coal</b> Bed Methane Policy (CBM-IV) for exploration and production of Coal Bed Methane.

50|$|New Mills is in {{the area}} {{formerly}} known as Bowden Middlecale which was a grouping of ten hamlets. The name of New Mylne (New Mills) was given to it from a corn-mill, erected in 1391, near to the present Salem Mill on the River Sett in the hamlet of Ollersett. This was adjacent to a convenient bridge over the Sett. By the late sixteenth century the name {{was applied to the}} group of houses that grew up <b>round</b> it. <b>Coal</b> mining was the first industry of the area, with up to 40 small pits and mines exploiting the Yard Seam. The climate, good construction stone and the availability of stable land by fast-flowing water was ideal for cotton spinning. Cotton mills and print-works were built in the Torrs Gorge from 1788. Dwellings were built {{on the sides of the}} gorge, sometimes with one home built on top of another, both being entered at their respective street levels.

500|$|The {{stations}} burned {{a mix of}} bituminous and anthracite coal. They consumed [...] of coal {{per week}} and had a peak consumption of [...] per week during the winter. They were well positioned to use coal from the Northumberland and County Durham coal fields. All of the coal used in the stations was brought to them via rail transport from UK coal stocks. Trains delivered coal to the station using the North Blyth Branch of the Blyth and Tyne Railway. The stations' coal handling facility was fitted with a Merry go <b>Round</b> (MGR) <b>coal</b> delivery system in 1981, after high capacity rapid discharge waggons became the British Rail standard. This system involved the trains slowly passing over a hopper and automatically discharging their cargo through doors underneath the train. Because of site space restrictions, a balloon loop track layout could not be constructed, so instead {{of being able to}} move continuously, trains arriving on site had to pull onto a reception track; the locomotive would then uncouple and recouple at the opposite end, before slowly moving over the unloading track hopper and discharging the coal and eventually leaving site. Towards the end of the station's operation, coal was more frequently brought in by road. All coal was delivered to and stored in a large open area {{to the north of the}} power stations. This had a tarmac barrier underneath it to prevent downward contamination. The coal was brought from the storage area to the station using a system of conveyor belts, which travelled over the Bedlington-Cambois Road separating the two sites, before being integrated to feed both stations as necessary.|$|R

In later {{announcements}} Fawkes' bragged that his son was the finest Posture Master in Europe. Because of the popularity of the contortionist act he took on another younger boy to perform a similar act but [...] "all different from what his own boy performs".Ricky Jay, who has researched Fawkes, believe that a piece in the Daily Courant from 1711 may refer to Fawkes as it mentions a posture master and many conjuring tricks that later became staples of Fawkes' show.Fawkes was not the first fair conjurer and neither was he particularly innovative in his routines (though he did make copious use of the recently invented Egg Bag), but by consciously rejecting the association of conjuring with black magic and mysterious forces and making it clear that his show was not designed to defraud his audience, he {{was among the first to}} successfully market his act to fashionable society outside the fairs. Fawkes eschewed the stereotypical voluminous cloak and hat of the traditional fair conjurer and instead presented himself in gentrified dress with a powdered wig and smart suit.

40|$|Finite element models, which {{employ the}} Drucker-Prager yield criterion, have been {{developed}} to simulate the static contact statuses between conical silos and granular materials in 3 forms: the near contact, the sliding contact and the sticking contact. Contact conditions are established when 2 separated surfaces touch at normal direction while maintaining tangential relative movement. In general physical meaning, the surfaces in contact status have the following characteristics: 1) No penetration between each other; 2) The normal pressure and the tangent friction force may be transferred during contact; 3) Generally the normal pulling force cannot be transferred when surface separation occurs. Due to the symmetric property of conical structures, simplified two-dimensional contacting simulations are carried out in this paper, nonlinear finite element software ANSYS is used and the contacting surfaces between granular materials and conical silos are defined with rigid-to-flexible surface-to-surface contact pair. The target surfaces of conical silos are modeled with TARGE 169 element and the contact surfaces of granular materials are modeled with CONTA 171 element. During finite element analysis, conical silos and granular materials are meshed with two-dimensional solid element, PLANE 42. The static contact statuses are investigated with conical silos containing different granular materials. The silo geometries vary at a dip angle of 20 °, 33. 7 ° and 45 °. Sunflower seeds, corn, <b>coal,</b> <b>rounded</b> gravel and wheat are selected as the granular materials. Results show that the mechanical properties of granular materials (including bulk density, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, dilation angle, internal friction angle, cohesion) and silo designs (especially dip angle) have significant effects on the contact statuses at the interface between conical silos and granular materials: 1) For various granular material, 3 contact statuses, i. e. the form of near contact, sliding contact and sticking contact, can be found between granular materials and conical silo walls; 2) The contact statuses between conical silos and granular materials do not depend on (or not mainly depend on) any mechanical property of granular materials. The contact statuses are a combined effect of all mechanical properties of granular materials. Those granular materials with very small dilation angle may have the near contact statuses. Those granular materials with higher cohesive force usually present a smaller sticking contact area, and those granular materials with higher elastic modulus and bulk density usually present a larger sticking contact area than those with opposite material properties; 3) With the decreasing of conical silo depth, the near contact area disappears, the sliding contact area decreases and the sticking contact area increases. 4) Under the sliding contact status, the friction energy dissipation is mainly due to the relative motion between contact surfaces. Under the sticking contact status, the friction energy dissipation is mainly due to the elastic deformation because of the contact. The greater the sticking contact area, the more difficultly the silo discharges. The greater the sliding contact area, the more seriously the silo internal surfaces could be damaged. Since larger sticking/sliding contact area inevitably causes unloading difficulties or friction damage, contact statuses between granular materials and conical silos should be optimized in the silos design in order to boost storage efficiency...|$|R
