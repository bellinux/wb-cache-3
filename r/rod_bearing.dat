50|$|Around mid-distance, trouble hits Spear’s Ferrari, {{crippled}} by a broken oil seal. Last year’s winner’s, John Fitch and Walters, in their Ferrari had been marking up time, and with Spear’s retirement, the only {{threat to the}} flying Lancias. Fitch and Walters had been pushing the car hard, and this too would not finish, going out late afternoon with a bad connecting <b>rod</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Rod</b> <b>bearings</b> {{were made}} of babbitt cast {{integral}} with the <b>rod.</b> The <b>bearing</b> was adjustable for wear by removing copper shims placed between the rod cap and connecting rod. In this way specified oil clearance could be maintained. If the crankshaft were to be turned undersized, or if the bearing was damaged or worn out, <b>rod</b> and <b>bearing</b> were replaced as a unit, typically at the dealership.|$|R

5000|$|The {{centerline}} of {{the cylinders}} are also offset from the {{centerline of the}} crankshaft by 12.5 mm. To accommodate the offset cylinder placement and narrow [...] "Vee" [...] design, the connecting <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> journals are offset 22° to each other. This also allows {{the use of a}} 120° firing interval between cylinders. [...] The firing order is: 1, 5, 3, 6, 2, 4.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 1978, the 200 cid {{replaced}} the larger 250 cid {{as the base}} engine for Chevrolet's new downsized intermediate line. The 200 cid used a unique 3.5-inch bore and a 3.48-inch stroke (the Chevrolet 305 cid and 350 cid V8 engines shared the same stroke dimension). These bore and stroke dimensions were later used by the 267 cid V8 Chevrolet engine. Also like the small block V8 engines, the 200 cid V6 used 2.45-inch main bearings and 2.10-inch <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> diameters.|$|E
50|$|After an {{intensive}} investigation, the probable {{cause of the}} crash was cited to be failure of the rear master <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> on the number three engine. The failure caused the rear crankpin to overheat and fail, whereupon all the rear connecting rods failed, tearing through the cylinder walls and crankcase. In the process, oil lines were torn open, which caused the fire. Sludge buildup in the crankpins, blocking oil flow {{was thought to be}} the root cause, which resulted in improved oil screens and the implementation of a crankpin plug, as well as revised oil change intervals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{shows the}} {{performance}} {{analysis of a}} sealless cylinder with a conical type piston and one of three types of <b>rod</b> <b>bearings.</b> The piston without seal is composed of cylindrical and conical portions in the axial direction. The 2 D Reynolds equation is solved with a finite difference method for the performance analysis. The relationship between self-centering force and leakage flow rate are investigated. The sealless cylinder fabricated with the proposed optimum design values was tested with three different types of <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> having four, five and six pockets respectively. Leakage flow rate tests were conducted to evaluate {{the performance of the}} proposed sealless cylinder. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{stocks are}} {{found within the}} Baltoceratidae, those with a {{calcareous}} rod secreted on the lower surface of {{the inside of the}} siphuncle known as [...] "rod-bearing" [...] and those without, in which the interior of the siphuncle tube is empty, known as [...] "vacuosiphonate". Empty siphuncled forms, the vacuosiphonate, gave rise to the Michelinoceratidae, commonly known as the Orthoceratidae, which has its beginning in the lower Cassinian stage {{in the latter part of}} the Lower Ordovician. <b>Rod</b> <b>bearing</b> forms gave rise to the Troedsonnellidae with early members, Buttsoceras and Tajaroceras found in the upper Cassinian.|$|E
5000|$|The {{drop-forged steel}} six-throw {{crankshaft}} runs in seven main bearings; unlike {{the majority of}} wide angle V6 engines which have only four main bearings. [...] The connecting <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> journals are offset 22° to one another. [...] Two overhead camshafts (OHCs) operate the automatic hydraulic valve lifters which, in turn, open and close the 39.0 mm intake and 34.3 mm exhaust valves. Since the two 'rows' of pistons and cylinders share a single cylinder head and head gasket, the piston crown (or top surface) is tilted. Intake and exhaust valves need different camshafts to vary valve overlap (they may be coaxial like in some 90° V8).|$|E
5000|$|... 1970 - The [...] "400" [...] is {{introduced}} in September 1969 for the 1970 model year, with a bore of 4.125" [...] and {{a stroke of}} 3.75". This engine introduced the [...] "large-journal" [...] crankshaft with a main journal size of 2.65" [...] and <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> journals of 2.10". This engine also introduced [...] "Siamese bores" [...] to the Chevrolet small-block line, requiring [...] "steam holes" [...] in the cylinder heads and head gaskets, which were used to prevent hot spots and subsequent overheating. The connecting rods, due to the long stroke, are also shorter at 5.565", differing from the 5.7" [...] length of all other Generation I small-block connecting rods.|$|E
5000|$|All G engines used {{forged steel}} {{crankshafts}} {{until the middle}} of model year 1976, when a less costly cast-iron crankshaft was introduced. The cast crankshaft uses a different block, different main and connecting <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> and different connecting rods.|$|R
5000|$|The Generation III 5.7 L shares little {{other than}} similar displacement, {{external}} dimensions, and <b>rod</b> <b>bearings,</b> with its predecessor (LT1). It is an all-aluminium [...] pushrod engine with a bore of 3.898 in and {{a stroke of}} 3.62 in.|$|R
50|$|The crankshaft, {{located within}} the crankcase, rotates on five {{aluminum}} alloy bearings and is balanced by eight weights. Oil holes {{are located in the}} middle of the crankshaft to provide oil to the connecting <b>rods,</b> <b>bearing,</b> pistons and various other components.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{showing some}} {{impressive}} results in Formula Two, {{in order to}} further fund his car racing, he was enticed back to motorcycling by an offer from Jawa in 1969 to race their 350 cc motorcycle. The season started promising, as he took two second places behind Giacomo Agostini. However, during practice for the fifth race, on the Sachsenring in East Germany, his motorcycle's engine seized due to the breaking up of the lower left hand connecting <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> cage. He was thrown from the bike, his helmet came off. He and the bike slid off the track where he impacted an unprotected fence post before bouncing back {{to the edge of the}} racing surface.|$|E
5000|$|The 229 cid has a 3.736-inch bore and a 3.48-inch stroke, {{identical}} to the Chevrolet 305 cid V8 engine. The 229 cid used the same 2.45-inch main bearing and 2.10-inch <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> diameters as the 200 cid V6 engine. Also like the 200 cid V6, the 229 cid used the same crankshaft with the 18-degree offset throws and the same 5.7-inch connecting rods with 0.050-inch narrowed ends. It came equipped with 1.84-inch intake valves and 1.50-inch exhaust valves. The 229 cid V6 was only equipped with a 2-barrel carburetor. For 1980 the 229 cid used a mechanical Dualjet. From 1981 to 1984 the electronic Dualjet was used along with the GM's CCC (Computer Command Control) system. The 229 cid was rated between 110 and [...]|$|E
50|$|Option One - Shorter Piston:The stock Chrysler LA {{engine in}} the example above has a main to <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> {{centerline}} distance of 1.79 in (4.55 cm), a rod that is 6.123 in (15.55 cm) long, and a piston that is 1.67 in from piston pin centerline to top, depending on the application. As the engine stroke is increased {{in the example}} above, the 402 cubic inch (6.6 l) configuration would place the piston 0.21 in (0.53 cm) higher in the cylinder at top dead center, and with a distance of 9.585 in (24.36 cm) from crankshaft main centerline to deck, the piston would protrude about 0.21 in (0.53 cm) higher than the top deck, or would collide with the cylinder head combustion chamber. To offset this, aftermarket pistons relocate the piston pin higher within the piston itself. This change in compression height leaves the piston with 1.462 in (3.714 cm) of material in the top portion of the piston, instead of 1.672 in (4.247 cm) as is stock.|$|E

The result showed the stress analysis of connecting <b>rod</b> big end <b>bearing.</b> The purpose {{is to provide a}} theoretical basis for the actual conditions of connecting <b>rod</b> big end <b>bearing,</b> and to improve the design of the crankshaft structure...|$|R
50|$|The Waste Heat Engine's design {{requires}} {{the use of}} water to lubricate the moving parts because exhaust steam goes into the engine crankcase. Any oil used to lubricate crankshaft and connecting <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> would soon form an emulsion of oil and water that would have very poor lubricating properties.|$|R
50|$|From these {{holes in}} the main journals, the oil moves through passageways inside the {{crankshaft}} to exit {{holes in the}} rod journals to lubricate the <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> and connecting <b>rods.</b> Some simpler designs relied on these rapidly moving parts to splash and lubricate the contacting surfaces between the piston rings and interior surfaces of the cylinders. However, in modern designs, there are also passageways through the rods which carry oil from the <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> to the rod-piston connections and lubricate the contacting surfaces between the piston rings and interior surfaces of the cylinders. This oil film {{also serves as a}} seal between the piston rings and cylinder walls to separate the combustion chamber in the cylinder head from the crankcase. The oil then drips back down into the oil pan.|$|R
5000|$|Except {{for very}} large examples, {{lubrication}} {{was almost always}} manual. Main crankshaft bearings and the connecting <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> on the crankshaft generally has a grease cup—a small container (cup) filled with grease and a screwed-on cover. [...] When the cover is screwed down tighter, grease is {{forced out of the}} bottom of the cup and into the bearing. Some early engines have just a hole in the bearing casting cap where an operator squirts lubricating oil while the engine is running. The piston is lubricated by a drip oiler that continuously feeds drips of oil onto the piston. The excess oil from the piston runs out of the cylinder onto the engine and eventually onto the ground. The drip oiler can be adjusted to drip faster or slower depending on the need for lubrication, dictated by how hard the engine is working. The rest of the moving engine components were all lubricated by oil that the engine operator would have to apply from time to time while the engine was running.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the oldest}} yard-rods in {{existence}} is the clothyard of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors. It consists of a hexagonal iron rod [...] inch in diameter and [...] inch short of a yard, encased within a silver <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> the hallmark 1445. In the early 15th century, the Merchant Taylors Company was authorized to [...] "make search" [...] {{at the opening of}} the annual St. Bartholemew's Day Cloth Fair. In the mid-18th century Graham compared the standard yard of the Royal Society to other existing standards. These were a [...] "long-disused" [...] standard made in 1490 during the reign of Henry VII, and a brass yard and a brass ell from 1588 in the time of Queen Elizabeth and still in use at the time, held at the Exchequer; a brass yard and a brass ell at the Guildhall; and a brass yard presented to the Clock-Makers' Company by the Exchequer in 1671. The Exchequer yard was taken as [...] "true"; the variation was found to be + to − of an inch, and an additional graduation for the Exchequer yard was made on the Royal Society's standard. In 1758 the legislature required the construction of a standard yard, which was made from the Royal Society's standard and was deposited with the clerk of the House of Commons; it was divided into feet, one of the feet into inches, and one of the inches into tenths. A copy of it, but with upright cheeks between which other measuring rods could be placed, was made for the Exchequer for commercial use.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] is {{the only}} engine in this family and was {{introduced}} in 1970 and produced for 10 years. It has a 4.125 in bore and a 3.75 in stroke. The 400 differed from other small blocks in that the cylinders were siamesed and therefore required 'steam' holes in the block, head gaskets, and heads to help alleviate 'hot-spots' in the cooling system at the point above the siamesed cylinders. Overheating and damage are likely if head gaskets or heads without 'steam' holes are used on a 400 block. The 400 {{is the only}} engine that uses a 2.65" [...] main bearing journal and a 2.10" [...] <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> journal. The connecting rod was also 400 specific being 5.565" [...] {{as opposed to the}} 5.7" [...] rod used in all other small block Chevrolet engines. The 400 was made in 4-bolt main journal from 1970 to 1972 and in 2-bolt main journal from 1973 to 1980. The 400 can have either 2 or 3 freeze-plugs per side though all 400 blocks have the provisions for a 3rd freeze-plug on each side. The 400 was rated at 245-265 horsepower (grossHP net) through its life. The 400 saw extensive use in full-size Chevrolet and GMC trucks; K5 Blazer/Jimmy, 1/2-ton, 3/4-ton, 1-ton, and even larger 'medium duty' trucks had an option to be equipped with a 400. The engine was available in midsize A-Body and full-size B-Body passenger cars {{until the end of the}} 1976 model year. Early models produced 265 horsepower with a two-barrel carburetor. All 400s came with a two-barrel carburetor with a four-barrel carburetor option becoming available in 1974.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} solution, {{almost universal}} in road car engines, {{is to use}} simple rods where cylinders from both banks share a journal. This requires the <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> to be narrower, increasing bearing load {{and the risk of}} failure in a high-performance engine. This also means the opposing cylinders are not exactly in line with each other.|$|R
50|$|This {{arrangement}} {{is simple and}} robust, but does not give a perfect geometry and so {{is known for its}} creaking noises and rough running, particularly if the <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> become worn. For the Swiss locomotives: well-maintained, powerful locomotives running at slow speeds over steep gradients, this was an acceptable design. It did not however make many inroads into fast passenger services.|$|R
50|$|The forged crankshaft, {{located within}} the crankcase, rotates on five {{aluminium}} alloy bearings and is balanced by eight weights.

50|$|Also {{unlike the}} Chevrolet inline 6, Ford {{products}} used {{high oil pressure}} for lubrication for the main and <b>rod</b> <b>bearings,</b> as do all modern vehicle combustion engines. While this offered no special performance advantage it did eliminate a complex oil jet system in the oil pan. As a side benefit to a prospective purchaser of a used vehicle, this also enabled {{the condition of the}} connecting <b>rod</b> and main <b>bearings</b> to be determined indirectly by observation of the analog oil pressure gauge after the vehicle was warmed up, provided that oil of normal viscosity was in use.|$|R
50|$|In 1963, a new 225ci slant six {{replaced}} the 251ci six used in 1961 & 1962 W100 & W200 Power Wagon Trucks. The Power Wagon W300 {{continued to use}} the 251ci. L-6 engine. The new 225ci engine (the 225-2) was able to power the med. duty trucks due to; a roller timing chain, bi-metal connecting <b>rod</b> <b>bearings,</b> stellite-faced exhaust valves, roto caps on exhaust valves and polyacrylic valve stem seals.|$|R
