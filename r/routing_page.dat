40|$|The BELLFLOW {{flowcharting}} {{system was}} developed to meet certain Bell System standards of documentation. There are three modes of operation with the BELLFLOW system: source mode, comment mode, and mixed mode. In the source mode, all of the flowcharting information is derived directly from the source code. In the comment mode, BELLFLOW ignores the source code completely and derives the entire flowchart purely from comments imbedded in the program. In the mixed mode, the source and comment mode are combined. The mixed mode is unique to BELLFLOW and was designed to provide a self-documenting program source deck. Other features of BELLFLOW include: automatic placement, automatic line <b>routing,</b> <b>paging,</b> and generation of on and off sheet connectors...|$|R

40|$|Mobile IP {{is useful}} for {{providing}} mobility of Internet users but it has shown its limitations in various aspects such as simplicity, robustness and scalability, particularly with fast moving users requiring many handoffs. A hierarchical structure using micromobility helps to reduce the control signalling overhead associated with handoff by localizing handoff management in a given coverage area and using Mobile IP outside it. Cellular IP is one such micro-mobility protocol that uses two caches: one is a Routing Cache for active users and another is a Paging Cache for idle users. Simplified Cellular IP is a modification of that to reduce control signalling overhead by using a single cache for both types of users. However, it still uses two separate time-out values for <b>routing</b> and <b>paging</b> messages. In this paper we show that by appropriately choosing a single time-out value significant reduction in control signaling overhead can be made. We also show that it reduces packet loss, facilitating efficient micro-mobility management. 6 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Vehicular {{energy network}} (VEN) is a {{vehicular}} network which can transport energy {{over a large}} geographical area by means of electric vehicles (EVs). In the near future, an abundance of EVs, plentiful generation of the renewables, and mature wireless energy transfer and vehicular communication technologies will expedite the realization of VEN. To transmit energy from a source to a destination, we need to establish energy paths, which are composed of segments of vehicular routes, while satisfying various design objectives. In this paper, we develop a method to construct all energy paths for a particular energy source-destination pair, followed by some analytical results of the method. We describe how to utilize the energy paths to develop optimization models for different design goals and propose two solutions. We also develop a heuristic for the power loss minimization problem.

40|$|In this paper, a {{construction}} of constant weight codes {{based on the}} unique decomposition of elements in lattices is presented. The conditions for unique primary decomposition and unique irreducible decomposition in lattices are discussed and connections with the decomposition of ideals in Noetherian commutative rings established. In this context it is shown, drawing on the definitive works of Dilworth, Ward and others, that, as opposed to Noetherian commutative rings, the existence of unique irreducible decomposition in lattices does not guarantee unique primary decomposition. The source alphabet in our proposed construction {{is a set of}} uniquely decomposable elements constructed from a chosen subset of irreducible or primary elements of the appropriate lattice. The distance function between two lattice elements is based on the symmetric distance between sets of constituent elements. It is known that constructing such constant weight codes is equivalent to constructing a Johnson graph with appropriate parameters. Some bounds on the code sizes are also presented and a method to obtain codes of optimal size, utilizing the Johnson graph description of the codes, is discussed.

We discuss the maximum system time for a packet and estimate with up-to-date results how this can be achieved. We figure out the maximum amount of time where a packet can spend in the network (i. e. worst case system time), and argue that the universal instability of the presented interval-strategy can be reached through these results. When a large group of queueing strategies is used for queueing, we prove that the interval-strategy will be universally unstable. Finally, we calculate the maximum time of the static routing to reach an universal stable and polynomial - in detail linear - bounded interval-strategy.

The cross pattern remains stable up to the zero value of the immiscibility parameter |Δ |, while simpler rectilinear (quasi- 1 D) DWs exist only for values of |Δ | essentially exceeding those in BEC mixtures (two spin states of the same isotope) currently available to the experiment.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for broadband multimedia services and their extension to mobiles has spurred provision via satellites. This is because satellite systems {{can provide a}} truly global coverage that cannot be economically realised by either fixed wireline systems or terrestrial mobile systems. Most of next generation satellite systems proposed, such as Astrolink, SPACEWAY and SkyBridge, consider using ATM or ATM based technology over satellite to provide broadband services requiring mobility and higher bandwidth. This thesis therefore concerns future broadband satellite networks that use on-board processing and intersatellite links to extend the terrestrial ATM provision to worldwide satellite systems. This thesis discusses the air interface connection management and call handling schemes for integrated mobile/fixed ATM-satellite networks. The prime aim is to research an integrated solution that provides effective radio connection management and mobility support whilst maintaining the required QoS at both user terminals and gateway earth stations. We target at minimising the difference in performance between terrestrial ATM and ATM over satellite and providing mobility extension to the ATM protocols, whilst maintaining a high satellite channel efficiency and keeping {{as little as possible}} signalling modifications. In this thesis, an efficient radio connection management scheme, which is designed for a QoS-provisioning transport of ATM traffic over satellite links, and a mobility-enhanced signalling protocol scheme for mobile ATM-satellite networks are proposed. Another large proportion of this thesis is devoted to the optimisations of multiple access and logic link control because these are the major factors that effecting the performance within ATM- satellite integrated systems. As a result, a semi-permanent signalling protocol, a reliability- dependent Selective Repeat Automatic Repeat reQuest (SR ARQ) and an adaptive timer SR ARQ are proposed. In addition to the proposed connection management scheme, a reservation meta-signalling for setting up signalling connections at the user-network radio interface and a mobility-enhanced call handling protocol derived from Q. 2931 are proposed. Call control functions such as call <b>routing,</b> location update, <b>paging,</b> handover and authentication are discussed as well. The proposed signalling protocol architecture provides a protocol reference model for ATM-satellite integrated systems. The verification and demonstration of the advantages of the semi-permanent signalling protocol, which offers a new method to improve the system channel efficiency on signalling connections, have been achieved. The proposed reliability-dependent SR ARQ protocol provides a novel approach to optimise the transmission throughput to support a variety of traffic types with different QoS requirements in ATM-satellite systems. The proposed connection management scheme effectively manages the air interface connections for ATM services through diversifying connection types, establishing QoS-based connections and deploying an efficient connection mapping and control scheme. The proposed radio connection management scheme together with the optimised Multiple Access Control (MAC) and ARQ provides a framework of interworking protocols for ATM over satellites. It can also find application in other similar systems that involve the integration of terrestrial protocols and mobile satellites. The research work that has been accomplished herein provides a solution and guidance to the design of signalling protocols for mobile satellite systems to implement ATM technology or indeed other future protocols...|$|R
