40|$|Abstract. Models {{to predict}} the fate of gaseous {{radionuclides}} have received considerable attention in the literature. They vary considerably in their complexity from ample models with tittle attempt to reflect processes within the system to those {{with a high level}} of mechanistic complexity. The following paper describes an approach that is a compromise between simplicity and realism. In the proposed model deposition is treated traditionally as the multiple of the air concentration, deposition velocity and exposure time but the subsequent allocation of radioactivity to different plant parts is determined by the growth rate of individual plant components <b>relative</b> to the <b>total</b> <b>growth</b> rate of the plant. The construction of the model is described along with its validation against independent data sets for the allocation of 3 iS and, 4 C in cabbage and bean following deposition in the form of CO 3 Sand, 4 C 02 at a number of discrete points in the growth season. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} and computation {{of the performance of}} Microfinance Banks in Nigeria in terms of credit performance, portfolio growth, link relative portfolio growth,  and categorization of portfolio, food security and employment generation using a case study of Standard Microfinance Bank, Yola. The withdrawal of licenses from 103 out of 407 listed Microfinance Banks in Nigeria was a concern to the researcher, being that Microfinance institutions are the major financial servers to the majority of Nigerians who are low income earners that are hardly served by the commercial banks. Using a standardard computer package, the chi-square test application shows that, although the portfolio growth of Standard Microfinance Bank Yola is not averagely 50. 20 % as claimed by the bank, there is an appreciable growth of 28. 96 %. But again, with 2005 as the base period, it recorded all time high link <b>relative</b> <b>total</b> portfolio <b>growth</b> of  548 %. And other indices such as credit performance of the bank and portfolio by category indicate that microfinance banking in the country may be heading to the right direction except for grossly inadequate portfolio allocation of 6 % for Agriculture which is supposed to be in the driving sit of the food security and employment generation. In trying times for institutions such as Microfinance Banks which bear benefits to the masses, it is recommended that either or both the regulatory body or/and the institution should publish a hope-giving-information that will dispel the possibility of the public completely losing hope in such institutions.

40|$|Abstract. Our {{goal was}} to test our {{understanding}} of ingestion, assimilation efficiency and metabolism for Mnemiopsis mccradyi by formulating and validating a simulation model of growth under different conditions of food availability. The model {{was based on a}} carbon budget approach using formulations derived from empirical results, including how each process was affected by food availability and ctenophore size. An experimentally measured carbon budget for pulsed food availability indicated that, <b>relative</b> to <b>total</b> ingestion, <b>growth</b> was high (17 - 48 %), respiration plus organic release was relatively low (24 — 48 %) and little ( 2) and a high gross growth efficiency (> 30 %) for smaller ctenophores at high food concentrations (> 20 prey 1). Both growth rates and growth efficiencies were predicted to decrease for larger ctenophores. Model predictions were generally consistent with experimental results, including investigations using pulsed food availability to simulate environmental patchiness. Although the model underpredicted ctenophore growth in some experiments at low food densities, the model prediction of a minimum prey concentration of about 8 I" 1 (24 (ig C I" 1) for sustaining a ctenophore population of reproductive size agreed with field observations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract To {{investigate}} complex growth compensation patterns, {{white pine}} (Pinus strobus L.) seedlings were clipped to simulate different herbivory levels. Seedlings were growing with different understory competition lev-els (created through monthly weeding vs no brush con-trol) under {{a range of}} overstory canopy closures. Com-pensation patterns varied for the different growth and size measures. After one growing season, seedlings did not fully compensate for lost biomass regardless of the competitive environments of the seedlings. Although rel-ative height growth was stimulated by light intensity clipping (20 – 40 % of last-year shoots removed), <b>relative</b> diameter <b>growth,</b> <b>total</b> biomass, and biomass growth of seedlings declined sharply with increasing clipping in-tensity. Likewise, all growth parameters declined with increasing interspecific competition. Results showed that seedlings in highly competitive environments showed smaller growth loss due to clipping than those in compe-tition-free environments, presumably because seedlings experiencing high interspecific competition devoted more energy to maintaining apical dominance and a balanced shoot-root ratio. While competition from canopy trees al-tered compensatory patterns, competition from understo-ry vegetation only altered the magnitude, but not the pat-terns, of compensatory growth. We suggest that compen-satory growth follows a complex pattern that will vary with the parameters measured, competitive conditions, and clipping intensities. Our results support the assertion that overcompensation may be an adaptation to competi-tive ability, rather than a response to herbivory itself...|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} {{rotating}} measurements {{has been designed}} and commissioned for a two-stage axial turbine of impulse design. <b>Relative</b> <b>total</b> pressure and strain gauge measurements in the rotating frame of reference have been performed during partial admission tests in this turbine. The overall project objectives are to determine unsteady aerodynamic losses related to admission sector-ends and rotor forcing functions. Some outcomes are presented and discussed herein. The unsteadiness in the measured <b>relative</b> <b>total</b> pressure is observed to be largest downstream of the suction side of the partial admission blockage where the high momentum fluid vividly interacts with the rotor. Strain gauge results show a high strain peak downstream of the suction side of the blockage. When reducing the shaft speed at constant pressure ratio, the dip in <b>relative</b> <b>total</b> pressure and the peak in tensile strain, that occur when a blade enters the blocked region, are shifted in the counter rotational direction.

Hashimoto (1997) proposed an AR/exclusion model based upon the concept of super-efficiency presented by Andersen and Petersen (1993). Although Green et al. (1996) proposed a rank order for the alternatives, they did not consider the possibility of assigning a weight of 0 for a given rank or the difference between two given ranks to be 0. Noguchi et al. (2002) presented a strong ordering to alternatives in which weights are obtained using the feasible solution region of the constraint set in LP. Obata and Ishii (2003) introduced a method to discriminate efficient alternatives using ranked voting data without considering information about inefficient alternatives. As such, the rank order presented using this method is independent of inefficient alternatives. Foroughi and Tamiz (2005) extended the model presented by Obata and Ishii (2003) {{in order to obtain}} the rank order for both efficient and inefficient alternatives.

METHODS: Rats were assigned randomly to four treatment groups that received a single iv dose of 50, 100, 200 mg/kg of NFLX and 0. 9 % saline, respectively. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was continuously recorded with a computer-ized system in freely moving rats. Venous blood {{samples were collected}} for determination of the NFLX concentra-tion by microbioassay method with Escherichia coli 441102 as the test strain. Toxicokinetic parameters were determined from serum concentration-time data with the 3 p 97 program. RESULTS: (1) The epileptiform dis-charges appeared in all NFLX groups with different latent periods, accompanied with limb twitching and clonic-tonic seizures. The <b>relative</b> <b>total</b> power of the EEG increased. (2) Drug serum concentration-time curves of different doses conformed to a two-compartmental model. The values of clearance, volume of distribution, and terminal half-life were dose-independent, while maximum serum concentrations (Cmax) and the areas under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0 ®¥) of NFLX increased with dosage.
