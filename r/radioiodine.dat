5|$|In adults, {{widespread}} {{screening of}} the general population is a matter of debate. Some organizations (such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the American Thyroid Association) recommend either intermittent testing above a certain age in both sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of thyroid disease, those who have received <b>radioiodine</b> or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, those with an abnormal thyroid examination, those with psychiatric disorders, people taking amiodarone or lithium, and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions). Yearly thyroid function tests are recommended in people with Down syndrome, as they are at higher risk of thyroid disease.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of a <b>radioiodine</b> release the {{ingestion}} of prophylaxis potassium iodide, if available, or even iodate, would rightly take precedence over perchlorate administration, and would be the first line of defence in protecting the population from a <b>radioiodine</b> release. However, in {{the event of}} a <b>radioiodine</b> release too massive and widespread to be controlled by the limited stock of iodide and iodate prophylaxis drugs, then the addition of perchlorate ions to the water supply, or distribution of perchlorate tablets would serve as a cheap, efficacious, second line of defense against carcinogenic <b>radioiodine</b> bioaccumulation.|$|E

Protecting the thyroid gland of infants and children remains a priority because of increased incidence of thyroid cancer in the young exposed to <b>radioiodines</b> (such as 131 I and 133 I). There {{is a lack of}} clinical studies for KI and <b>radioiodines</b> in children or infants to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of KI administration in the young. In this paper, we compare functional aspects of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis in the young and adults and review the limited studies of KI in children. The HPT axis in the infant and child is hyperactive and therefore will respond less effectively to KI treatment compared to adults.

50|$|Some {{radioactive}} iodide salts of sodium, including Na125I and Na131I, have radiopharmaceutical uses, {{such as in}} {{the treatment}} of thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism or as radiolabeling tracers in imaging (see Isotopes of iodine > <b>Radioiodines</b> I-123, I-124, I-125, and I-131 in medicine and biology).|$|R
25|$|Disadvantages of this {{treatment}} are a {{high incidence of}} hypothyroidism (up to 80%) requiring eventual thyroid hormone supplementation {{in the form of a}} daily pill(s). The <b>radioiodine</b> treatment acts slowly (over months to years) to destroy the thyroid gland, and Graves' disease-associated hyperthyroidism is not cured in all persons by <b>radioiodine,</b> but has a relapse rate that depends on the dose of <b>radioiodine</b> which is administered.|$|E
25|$|The {{ingestion}} of goitrogen drugs is, much like potassium iodide also {{not without its}} dangers, such as hypothyroidism. In all these cases however, despite the risks, the prophylaxis benefits of intervention with iodide, iodate or perchlorate outweigh the serious cancer risk from <b>radioiodine</b> bioaccumulation in regions where <b>radioiodine</b> has sufficiently contaminated the environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of a}} {{particular}} 'Iodine tablet' used in portable water purification has also been determined as somewhat effective at reducing <b>radioiodine</b> uptake.

25|$|The three {{treatment}} options are <b>radioiodine</b> therapy, medications, and thyroid surgery. <b>Radioiodine</b> therapy involves taking iodine-131 by mouth, {{which is then}} concentrated in the thyroid and destroys it over weeks to months. The resulting hypothyroidism is treated with synthetic thyroid hormone. Medications such as beta blockers may control some of the symptoms, and antithyroid medications such as methimazole may temporarily help people while other treatments are having effect. Surgery to remove the thyroid is another option. Eye problems may require additional treatments.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{carcinogenicity}} of its {{beta radiation}} in the thyroid in small doses, I-131 is rarely used primarily or solely for diagnosis (although {{in the past}} this was more common due to this isotope's relative ease of production and low expense). Instead the more purely gamma-emitting <b>radioiodine</b> iodine-123 is used in diagnostic testing (nuclear medicine scan of the thyroid). The longer half-lived iodine-125 is also occasionally used when a longer half-life <b>radioiodine</b> is needed for diagnosis, and in brachytherapy treatment (isotope confined in small seed-like metal capsules), where the low-energy gamma radiation without a beta component makes iodine-125 useful. The other radioisotopes of iodine are never used in brachytherapy.|$|E

Iodine-123 is preferred for imaging, so I-125 is used diagnostically only when the test requires a longer period to prepare the radiopharmaceutical and trace it, such as a fibrinogen scan to diagnose clotting. I-125's gamma radiation is of medium penetration, making it more useful as a therapeutic isotope for brachytherapy implant of radioisotope capsules for local treatment of cancers.|$|R
40|$|The most {{significant}} {{impact of the}} Chernobyl accident is the increased incidence of thyroid cancer among children {{who were exposed to}} short-lived <b>radioiodines</b> and 131 -iodine. In order to accurately estimate the radiation dose provided by these <b>radioiodines,</b> it is necessary to know where iodine is incorporated. To do that, the distribution at the cellular level of newly organified iodine in the immature rat thyroid was performed using secondary ion mass microscopy (NanoSIMS 50). Actual dosimetric models take only into account the averaged energy and range of beta particles of the radio-elements and may, therefore, imperfectly describe the real distribution of dose deposit at the microscopic level around the point sources. Our approach is radically different since based on a track-structure Monte Carlo code allowing following-up of electrons down to low energies (~ 10 eV) what permits a nanometric description of the irradiation physics. The numerical simulations were then performed by modelling the complete disintegrations of the short-lived iodine isotopes as well as of 131 I in new born rat thyroids in order to take into account accurate histological and biological data for the thyroid gland...|$|R
25|$|To {{completely}} {{block the}} uptake of iodine-131 by the purposeful addition of perchlorate ions to a population's water supply, aiming at dosages of 0.5mg/kg-day, or a water concentration of 17 ppm, would therefore be grossly inadequate at truly reducing <b>radioiodine</b> uptake. Perchlorate ion concentrations in a region's water supply would therefore {{need to be}} much higher, {{with at least a}} total dosage of 7.15mg/kg of body weight per day needing to be aimed for, with this being achievable for most adults by consuming 2 liters of water per day with a water concentration of 250mg/kg of water, or 250 ppm of perchlorate ions per liter; only at this level would perchlorate consumption offer adequate protection, and be truly beneficial to the population at preventing bioaccumulation when exposed to a <b>radioiodine</b> environment. This being entirely independent of the availability of iodate or iodide drugs.|$|E
25|$|The continual {{addition}} of perchlorate {{to the water}} supply would need to continue for no less than 80–90 days, beginning immediately after the initial release of <b>radioiodine</b> is detected; after 80–90 days have passed, released radioactive iodine-131 will have decayed to less than 0.1% of its initial quantity, and thus the danger from biouptake of iodine-131 is essentially over.|$|E

40|$|Over 500 {{cases of}} thyroid cancer were {{diagnosed}} in Belarus between 1986 and 1995 among persons exposed as children (under 15 years of age) to radioactive contamination from the Chernobyl nuclear accident. There {{is little doubt}} that radioactive iodine isotopes emitted during the nuclear explosion and subsequent fire were instrumental in causing malignancy in this particular organ. Comparison of the observed geographic distribution of Chernobyl-associated thyroid cancer incidence rates by districts with contamination maps of radioactive fallout shows a better fit for estimated 131 I contamination than for 137 Cs. Because 131 I used for medical purposes had not been considered carcinogenic in humans in the past, and in view of the unusually short latency period between exposure and clinical manifestation of cancer, it is suspected that not only 131 I but also energy-rich shorter-lived <b>radioiodines</b> may {{have played a role in}} post-Chernobyl thyroid carcinogenesis. Measurements of iodine isotopes are not available, but reconstruction of geographic distributions and estimations of radioactive fallout based on meteorological observations immediately following the accident could provide a basis for comparison with the distribution of thyroid cancer cases. In this paper, data from the Epidemiological Cancer Register for Belarus will be used to show geographic and time trends of thyroid cancer incidence rates in the period from 1986 to 1995 among persons who were exposed as children, and these will be compared with the estimated contamination by <b>radioiodines.</b> Tentative conclusions are drawn from the available evidence and further research requirements discussed...|$|R

50|$|Additional {{follow-up}} {{checks on}} the Marshallese studied in Project 4.1 were conducted {{at regular intervals}} afterwards every year since 1954. Though the Marshallese experienced far milder immediate effects than the Japanese fishermen exposed to Bravo fallout on the fishing boat Daigo Fukuryū Maru, the long-term effects were more pronounced. For the first decade after the test, the effects were ambiguous and statistically difficult to correlate to radiation exposure: miscarriages and stillbirths among exposed Rongelap women doubled {{in the first five}} years after the accident, but then returned to normal; some developmental difficulties and impaired growth appeared in children, but in no clear-cut pattern. In the decades that followed, though, the effects were undeniable. Children began to suffer disproportionately from thyroid cancer (due to exposure to <b>radioiodines),</b> and almost a third of those exposed developed neoplasms by 1974.|$|R
25|$|<b>Radioiodine</b> (radioactive iodine-131) was {{developed}} in the early 1940s at the Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center. This modality is suitable for most patients, although some prefer to use it mainly for older patients. Indications for <b>radioiodine</b> are failed medical therapy or surgery and where medical or surgical therapy are contraindicated. Hypothyroidism may be a complication of this therapy, but may be treated with thyroid hormones if it appears. The rationale for radioactive iodine is that it accumulates in the thyroid and irradiates the gland with its beta and gamma radiations, about 90% of the total radiation being emitted by the beta (electron) particles. The most common method of iodine-131 treatment is to administer a specified amount in microcuries per gram of thyroid gland based on palpation or radiodiagnostic imaging of the gland over 24 hours. Patients who receive the therapy must be monitored regularly with thyroid blood tests to ensure they are treated with thyroid hormone before they become symptomatically hypothyroid.|$|E
25|$|Major uses of 131I {{include the}} {{treatment}} of thyrotoxicosis (hyperthyroidism) and some types of thyroid cancer that absorb iodine. The 131I is thus used as direct radioisotope therapy to treat hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease, and sometimes hyperactive thyroid nodules (abnormally active thyroid tissue that is not malignant). The therapeutic use of <b>radioiodine</b> to treat hyperthyroidism from Graves' disease was first reported by Saul Hertz in 1941.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{cause is}} unclear; however, it is {{believed}} to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. A person {{is more likely to}} be affected if they have a family member with the disease. If one twin is affected, a 30% chance exists that the other twin will also have the disease. The onset of disease may be triggered by stress, infection, or giving birth. Those with other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to be affected. Smoking increases the risk of disease and may worsen eye problems. The disorder results from an antibody, called thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), that has a similar effect to thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). These TSI antibodies cause the thyroid gland to produce excess thyroid hormone. The diagnosis may be suspected based on symptoms and confirmed with blood tests and <b>radioiodine</b> uptake. Typically, blood tests show a raised T3 and T4, low TSH, increased <b>radioiodine</b> uptake in all areas of the thyroid, and TSI antibodies.|$|E
40|$|Iododeoxyuridine (IUdR), {{labelled}} with <b>radioiodines</b> emitting Auger, alpha or beta- radiation, {{has been}} proposed as a therapeutic tool {{in the treatment of}} cancer.

Using unlabelled IUdR as a modulator, we have studied the in vitro cytotoxicity of [125 I]-IUdR in two human glioblastoma cell lines. Surprisingly, an enhanced cytotoxicity of [125 I]-IUdR was observed in the presence of 0. 3 - 10 microM concentrations of unlabelled IUdR in U 251 glioblastoma cells {{and to a lesser extent}} in LN 229 cells. The presence of unlabelled IUdR unexpectedly increased the incorporation of [125 I]-IUdR in both cell lines.

25|$|A common {{treatment}} method for preventing iodine-131 exposure is by saturating the thyroid with regular, non-radioactive iodine-127, as an iodide or iodate salt. Free elemental iodine {{should not be}} used for saturating the thyroid because it is a corrosive oxidant and therefore is toxic to ingest in the necessary quantities. The thyroid will absorb very little of the radioactive iodine-131 after it is saturated with non-radioactive iodide, thereby avoiding the damage caused by radiation from <b>radioiodine.</b> The most common method of treatment is to give potassium iodide to those at risk. The dosage for adults is 130mg potassium iodide per day, given in one dose, or divided into portions of 65mg twice a day. This is equivalent to 100mg of iodine, and is about 700 times bigger than the nutritional dose of iodine, which is 0.150mg per day (150 micrograms per day). See potassium iodide for more information on prevention of <b>radioiodine</b> absorption by the thyroid during nuclear accident, or for nuclear medical reasons. The FDA-approved dosing of potassium iodide for this purpose are as follows: infants less than 1 month old, 16mg; children 1 month to 3 years, 32mg; children 3 years to 18 years, 65mg; adults 130mg. However, some sources recommend alternative dosing regimens.|$|E
25|$|Where {{radioactive}} contamination is present, a gas mask, dust mask, or good hygiene practices may offer protection, {{depending on the}} nature of the contaminant. Potassium iodide (KI) tablets can reduce the risk of cancer in some situations due to slower uptake of ambient <b>radioiodine.</b> Although this does not protect any organ other than the thyroid gland, their effectiveness is still highly dependent on the time of ingestion which would protect the gland for the duration of a twenty-four-hour period. They do not prevent acute radiation syndrome as they provide no shielding from other environmental radionuclides.|$|E

In another related study where subjects drank just 1 litre of perchlorate-containing water per day at a concentration of 10 ppm, i.e. daily 10mg of perchlorate ions were ingested, an average 38% reduction in the uptake of iodine was observed.|$|E
