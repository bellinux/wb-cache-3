2500|$|In 1998 {{the special}} edition [...] "Bilstein Edition RX" [...] was offered. It could be {{identified}} by a Bilstein badge on the right <b>rear</b> <b>boot</b> lid and a lower stance due to front and rear Bilstein struts. It also featured Leather seats and door inserts along with MOMO sports leather steering wheel and 16in BBS alloys as standard equipment.|$|E
50|$|Irmscher {{delivered}} the rally trim for the exterior. Large and widened wings, light weight hood, front wings, <b>rear</b> <b>boot</b> lid and doors were also installed.|$|E
50|$|Exterior:Front lip/spoiler, <b>Rear</b> <b>boot</b> spoiler with {{integral}} brake light, Headlight washers, electric sunroof, colour-coded mirrors, colour-coded door handles, colour-coded {{front rear}} bumpers, front fog lights, lightweight Speedline 5 spoke alloy wheels.|$|E
25|$|The UK {{version of}} the vehicle was {{intended}} {{to fit into the}} Vauxhall range below the Viva, and was initially presented only in its hatchback version, a style that became very popular during the 1970s. With its Pontiac-inspired 'shovel nose' and inset headlamps, the UK version looked radically different from the Opel Kadett and was accepted by the motoring public as a completely new car; when the saloon, estate car and van variants appeared and the hatchback was added to the Kadett lineup the common lineage became apparent. The Chevette was the first British-built hatchback of this size,; Ford did not respond with a similar product until the following year (their similar-sized offerings all having conventional <b>rear</b> <b>boots).</b>|$|R
50|$|Debuting in November 1960, it was {{initially}} an 1172 with revised front styling. It was made {{available as a}} bodyshell or with an Ashley chassis. It could be had as a drophead or a fixed head coupe with two or four seats. Later Sportiva's had a revised <b>rear</b> with <b>boot</b> lid and a longer wheelbase of eight feet to accommodate the new Mark 6 chassis. The fixed head coupe bodyshell retailed for £182.|$|R
50|$|The Chrysler CL models {{featured}} new grilles, a new {{nose cone}} and new bonnet, and, (on sedans), new <b>rear</b> panels including <b>boot</b> lid, lower panel and quarter panel. A panel van body style {{was added to}} the range in April 1977.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{designed}} by David Gottlieb and was advertised as having an [...] "indestructible" [...] plastic body made by Hordern-Richmond Ltd., the first ever car to have a plastic body. and seated three adults on a bench seat and two children in optional 'dickey seats' revealed when the <b>rear</b> <b>boot</b> was opened.|$|E
50|$|Various {{cosmetic}} changes {{include a}} revised grille, redesigned front headlights, bumpers, side air-intake grills, <b>rear</b> <b>boot,</b> etc. It held a decent amount of sales despite problems including uneven shut {{lines on the}} drivers door on models for the United Kingdom. Production was suspended in April 2005, when MG Rover collapsed. 39,249 MG TFs were built from 2002 until 2005.|$|E
50|$|Altogether 3,855 Elans {{were built}} between November 1989 and July 1992, {{including}} 129 normally aspirated (non-turbo) cars. 559 {{of them were}} sold in the US, featuring a 'stage 2 body' which had a different <b>rear</b> <b>boot</b> spoiler arrangement together with a lengthened nose to accommodate a USA-compliant crash structure and airbag, and 16-inch wheels (optional in most markets, standard in the U.S.) instead of 15-inch as on the UK model.|$|E
50|$|Compared to the {{previous}} generation, the Golf Mk7 has a roomier cabin, with greater shoulder room for {{the front and rear}} passengers, <b>rear</b> legroom and <b>boot</b> space. It is 20 mm broader than the Mk6 and the wheelbase is 59 mm longer.|$|R
50|$|The new TR4 {{body style}} {{did away with}} the cutaway door design of the {{previous}} TRs to allow for wind-down (roll-up) windows in place of less convenient side-curtains. The angular <b>rear</b> allowed a <b>boot</b> (trunk) with considerable capacity for a sports car.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} independents also took the PD3 and the Ulster Transport Authority took {{examples}} with fully fronted MCW bodies finished by the operator. Some of these on PD3/5 chassis had the newly optional O.680 11.1-litre 150 bhp engine and a luggage boot, {{for use on}} Belfast Airport services; some of the PD3/4s for rural routes also had a <b>rear</b> luggage <b>boot,</b> while the PD3/4s allocated to Derry City had the first instance of power-assisted steering on a Leyland double-decker.|$|R
50|$|For the UK and Irish {{market a}} special edition 190 was {{released}} for the 1993 model year. The car was given the badge name 190LE though on the <b>rear</b> <b>boot</b> lid it read 190 E (on the left hand side of the lock) and LE on the right hand side. Roughly 1000 LEs were produced and each one came with a large A3 sized certificate giving each car a unique number.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Equipe, the GT, {{was based}} on the Triumph Herald chassis with a fastback fibreglass body and also utilised further Triumph parts including the windscreen / scuttle assembly, and doors. The September 1964 GT4S model saw revisions to the body with twin headlights and an opening <b>rear</b> <b>boot.</b> It was powered by the same, mildly tuned up (63 bhp, later increased to 67 bhp), Herald-based 1147 cc engine used in the Triumph Spitfire.|$|E
5000|$|For the Australian market, the Subaru Liberty {{was offered}} in LX, GX, RX, and Heritage model grades.In 1998 the special edition [...] "Bilstein Edition RX" [...] was offered. It could be {{identified}} by a Bilstein badge on the right <b>rear</b> <b>boot</b> lid and a lower stance due to front and rear Bilstein struts. It also featured Leather seats and door inserts along with MOMO sports leather steering wheel and 16in BBS alloys as standard equipment.|$|E
50|$|The 400 {{featured}} {{independent front suspension}} with a transverse {{leaf spring}} and a live axle, located by an A-bracket over the differential case and longitudinal torsion bars with transverse arms and brackets at the rear. It featured a lengthy 2895 mm (114 inch) wheelbase and a very BMW-like grille {{at the front of}} its long bonnet. The passenger area was very short, with the spare tyre mounted inside the boot on the first cars, but eventually mounted on the <b>rear</b> hinged <b>boot</b> lid, inside an aluminum cover.|$|R
50|$|It {{was based}} on the {{mainstream}} Holden Premier of the same years, but with a lengthened <b>rear</b> body. The <b>boot</b> was simply extended by 8 in rather than increasing the 111 in wheelbase. The Premier's four-headlight grille was also kept. The model was a hasty response to Ford Australia's successful Fairlane.|$|R
50|$|The BMW M Roadster was {{designed}} to be the performance version of the BMW Z3, and there were {{significant differences between the two}} variants. The body of the Z3 M Roadster had a few differences compared to the standard Z3 models. These included front and <b>rear</b> bumpers, gills, <b>boot</b> and mirrors.|$|R
50|$|An Autech tuned {{version of}} the Pulsar SRV and Lucino SRV was also {{available}} featuring the SR18DE block, but was actually a 2.0L (1998cc) engine. Indicative features included {{the placement of the}} spare-wheel on the <b>rear</b> <b>boot</b> lid and inclusion of plastic side mouldings over the wheel arches and large rear spoiler. As a result of shifting the spare-wheel to the boot lid, the number plate had to be relocated in the rear bumper, meaning a bumper was produced specific for this model.|$|E
50|$|This {{vehicle was}} sold until late 2009 in Australia and New Zealand by Holden Special Vehicles as the HSV VXR. HSV VXRs are sold as {{standard}} with full leather trim, climate control, 6 disc CD and 19-inch alloy wheels. HSV VXRs were badged as per the UK Vauxhall Spec models, {{but without the}} usual <b>rear</b> <b>boot</b> badge. Inside the Opel Blitz appears {{on the steering wheel}} with an OPC dashboard. The Astra OPC was also sold as the Chevrolet Astra OPC in Chile.|$|E
50|$|Snowboard boot {{bindings}} {{are normally}} screwed onto the snowboard in a permanent orientation {{which is almost}} perpendicular to the direction of travel of the snowboard. When a snowboarder reaches {{the bottom of a}} run, the <b>rear</b> <b>boot</b> is typically released from its binding to allow the snowboarder to propel himself forward across relatively flat snow. Because the front foot in the snowboard binding is at an angle to forward motion, the snowboarder experiences discomfort and tension on his leg, knee and foot joint.|$|E
50|$|The car has a roof made of magnesium, front lid, {{front and}} <b>rear</b> wings and <b>boot</b> lid made of carbon, {{front and rear}} apron made of {{lightweight}} polyurethane, rear and side windows made of polycarbonate, rear silencers made of titanium. Porsche claims that the car will have a wet weight of 1,470 kg.|$|R
50|$|The Standard G variant is {{equipped}} with 14-inch eight-spoke alloy rims, fabric seats, polyurethane steering wheel, an audio system with USB, handphone or smartphone slot at the rear console, fixed rear seat headrests, 60:40 split folding <b>rear</b> seats, remote <b>boot</b> release, manual side mirrors without turn signals, body-mounted signal indicators, and power windows.|$|R
5000|$|Bedford co-developed with Duple the [...] "Vista" [...] {{coachwork}} for the OB, fronted by {{a classic}} bullnose. The ash framework was reinforced with steel, {{and the floor}} made from hardwood with softwood tongued and grooved boarding, {{with the exception of}} the cab area which was finished with alloy chequerplate. Seating capacity was normally 29 with overhead luggage racks provided for passengers, whilst the <b>rear</b> luggage <b>boot</b> was also used to store the spare wheel. The price of a complete coach, including finishing in a two-colour livery, was £1,314.10s for a 27-seater, and £1,325.10s for a twenty nine seater.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanics}} of the car remained much the same with 1.1 and 1.4 petrol engines and Hydragas suspension, but there was now the option of a Peugeot-sourced 1.5 diesel rather than the previous 1.4. The exterior was altered {{in an attempt to}} disguise the car's age, meet the increased cooling requirements of the Peugeot motor and offer a reduced-format Rover family grille. This was achieved through fitment of new front and rear bumpers, sill covers, <b>rear</b> <b>boot</b> handle and headlamps, bonnet and grille.|$|E
5000|$|The Waja {{received}} a facelift in 2005. The first minor facelift was <b>rear</b> <b>boot</b> spoiler, new alloy rims, new interior scheme (brown and cream), new instrument cluster, and dual airbags and ABS fitted as standard. Facelifted again in 2007, the Waja received the [...] CamPro CPS engine. The exterior was given minor changes, {{such as a}} new grille and new tail lights. The 2008 Waja CPS also includes both ABS and airbag as standard for the Malaysian market, which were previously optional equipment.|$|E
50|$|The first {{exterior}} was a text {{piece by}} Bob and Roberta Smith, Taxy {{in red and}} yellow vinyl. On the fold-up seats were two text pieces by Peter Liversidge, who became {{a regular contributor to}} the project and whose collected proposals were later published in book form. Also on display at the launch were All the animals, an embroidered cushion by Abigail Cohen, from Swiss Cottage to Soho and back, a book of drawings by Susie Hamilton, and Cab Gallery Greeting, a sound piece by Jessica Voorsanger. Absinthe was served out of the <b>rear</b> <b>boot</b> of the taxi.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a concept}} car {{inspired}} by the MX-5 GT race programme, built by Jota Sport. It included a normally aspirated 2.0-litre Mazda petrol engine rated 205 bhp, manual transmission, adjustable suspension, carbon front splitter, a <b>rear</b> diffuser and <b>boot</b> spoiler, sports exhaust system with a central tailpipe, Recaro seats, road slicks tires, body-coloured roll hoops behind the seats.|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time as the release of the R33 GT-R and GT-R V·Spec, Nissan {{released}} the R33 GT-R V·Spec N1 model. Changes made in the R33 N1 are similar to those in the R32 N1. The car was made lighter by removing the ABS, air conditioning, sound system, <b>rear</b> wiper, and <b>boot</b> carpet. The R33 GT-R V·Spec N1 received the slightly revised R33 N1 engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear seats}} can be rotated to look {{backwards}} through the <b>rear</b> hatch. The <b>boot</b> is a removable module {{which can be}} replaced with other modules. If no module is used then the small cargo deck {{can be used to}} carry items such as surfboards. The rear hatch can not be opened when the rear deck is in use or if a module is in place.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the 2008 BMW GINA fabric skinned concept, the ConnectedDrive {{features}} more traditional materials, {{but in an}} equally modern design, referred to by BMW's head of design Adrian van Hooydonk as a 'layered surface'. The front grille maintains the BMW style grille, and {{the front and rear}} lighting monitor the surrounding traffic conditions around the car. The doors are a variation of the 1989 BMW Z1, with the outer skins slide florward and the inner door slides backwards. The use of unconventional lighting is integrated into the overall design, from the bonnet area and around the seats to the <b>rear</b> <b>boot</b> lid.|$|E
50|$|The Faran Car Co. Ltd. was a U.K based {{company that}} offered both D-I-Y kit and {{in-house}} assembled options for their Eliminator kit. The design featured replacement fibreglass mouldings {{for the front}} and rear wings, together with front and rear integrated bumper sections. The external modifications were completed by side sill skirts and a <b>rear</b> <b>boot</b> spoiler which was not dissimilar in style to that found on a De Tomaso Pantera. Faran also offered conversions using Lancia or Fiat Twin Cam engine units, although some owners opted to keep the original SOHC setup. Production of the Faran kits ended following an unfortunate factory fire.|$|E
50|$|The 164 {{became the}} first Alfa to benefit from {{extensive}} use of computer aided design, used to calculate structural stresses {{that resulted in a}} very rigid but still relatively lightweight chassis. Although sharing the same platform as that of the Lancia Thema, Fiat Croma and Saab 9000, by virtue {{of the fact that it}} was the last of the four to enter production, it featured unique front suspension geometry and the most distinctive styling of the lot. In fact, for example, the other cars all shared identical side door panels. Though still voluminous, the 164 had the tightest aperture to the <b>rear</b> <b>boot,</b> which had a 510-Litre capacity.|$|E
50|$|The Yamaha IT250H was an enduro {{motorcycle}} made by Yamaha {{starting in}} 1981. It has an air-cooled single cylinder two-stroke engine with six speed gearbox. Front suspension is 32 mm telescopic forks, with rubber <b>boots.</b> <b>Rear</b> suspension is monoshock and aluminium swingarm. Brakes are single acting, half width drums at both ends. The IT {{was made for}} enduro use, although it was used with success for trail riding and motocross.|$|R
5000|$|The base XJ8 came {{standard}} {{with more}} equipment {{than had been}} fitted to entry-level XJs in the past, including leather upholstery, alloy wheels, and air conditioning. The door mirrors and door handles are body-coloured. [...] The radiator grille, windscreen and <b>rear</b> window surrounds, <b>boot</b> lid plinth, and rain gutters were chromed, while the window frames remained matte black. Interior wood trim is walnut. Rear badging reads [...] "XJ8".|$|R
50|$|Williams' most {{successful}} products are handcrafted riding boots. Williams' boots were unique {{when they were}} introduced to the market, as they consisted of a single piece of leather that was stitched at the <b>rear</b> of the <b>boot</b> (the models that featured an elastic side have been particularly popular). As of 2013, the R.M. Williams Company produces handcrafted riding boots, with the use of 70 hand processes and a single piece of leather.|$|R
