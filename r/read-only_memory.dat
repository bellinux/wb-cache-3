5|$|<b>Read-Only</b> <b>Memory</b> is a British {{publisher}} of art books on topics of video game history and culture. Following {{a resurgence of}} interest in 1980s and '90s British video game development, the company crowdfunded and produced four art books: an oral history of that Britsoft era, two books on British developers Sensible Software and The Bitmap Brothers, and a definitive volume on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, for which the publisher became best known. Read-Only Memory's books are archival anthologies, including original design documents juxtaposed with developer interviews and high-quality prints of in-game graphics. Reviewers were particularly impressed with each book's breadth of unreleased concepts.|$|E
5|$|Gran Trak 10 is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari through its subsidiary Cyan Engineering, and released by Atari in May 1974. In the game, a single player drives a car along a race track, viewed from above, avoiding walls of pylons {{and trying to}} pass as many checkpoints as possible before time runs out. The game is controlled with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and a gear stick, and the car crashes and spins if it hits a pylon. Gran Trak 10 began development in fall of 1973; it was initially designed by Larry Emmons of Cyan, with the mechanical design handled by Eigen Systems, though after several design and production problems were uncovered during an initial small production run in March 1974 the design was overhauled by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, with wider distribution beginning in May. The game's circuits include possibly the first instance of integrated circuit-based <b>read-only</b> <b>memory,</b> rather than graphics storied in diodes, which thereafter became the standard for arcade games.|$|E

25|$|For instance, {{instead of}} a {{hardware}} multiplier, a calculator might implement floating point mathematics with code in <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (ROM), and compute trigonometric functions with the CORDIC algorithm because CORDIC does not require much multiplication. Bit serial logic designs are more common in calculators whereas bit parallel designs dominate general-purpose computers, because a bit serial design minimizes chip complexity, but takes many more clock cycles. This distinction blurs with high-end calculators, which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design, more so the Z80, MC68000, and ARM architectures, and some custom designs specialized for the calculator market.|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} phenomena {{which will}} ultimately limit miniaturization of planar bipolar integrated circuits are examined. The maximum packing density is obtained by minimizing the supply voltage {{and the size}} of the devices. The minimum transistor size is determined by junction breakdown, punch through and doping fluctuations. For circuits that are fully active the maximum number of circuit functions per chip is determined by power dissipation. The packing density of <b>read-only</b> <b>memories</b> becomes limited by the area occupied by devices and interconnections. The limitations of MOS and bipolar technologies are compared. It is concluded that <b>read-only</b> <b>memories</b> will reach approximately the same performance and packing density with MOS and bipolar technologies, while fully active circuits will reach the highest levels of integration with dynamic MOS or complementary MOS technologies...|$|R
40|$|Recently General-Purpose Computing on Graphics Process-ing Units (GPGPU) {{has been}} used to reduce the {{processing}} time of various applications, but the degree of acceleration by the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) depends on the ap-plication.

In addition to employing a single GPU, the scalability using multiple GPUs is also evaluated. Compared to a Central Processing Unit (CPU) alone, the memory allo-cation method reduces the execution time for memory copies by approximately 60 % when a GPU is used, while utilizing <b>read-only</b> <b>memories</b> results in an approximately 20 % reduc-tion in the overall program execution time.

25|$|A cross {{assembler}} (see also cross compiler) is an assembler that is {{run on a}} computer or operating system (the host system) of a different type from the system on which the resulting code is to run (the target system). Cross-assembling facilitates the development of programs for systems {{that do not have}} the resources to support software development, such as an embedded system. In such a case, the resulting object code must be transferred to the target system, either via <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (ROM, EPROM, etc.) or a data link using an exact bit-by-bit copy of the object code or a text-based representation of that code, such as Motorola S-record or Intel HEX.|$|E
25|$|The first desktop {{programmable}} calculators {{were produced}} in the mid-1960s by Mathatronics and Casio (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the HP-65, in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the HP-25C introduced continuous memory, i.e., programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first alphanumeric, programmable, expandable calculator, the HP-41C. It could be expanded with random access memory (RAM, for memory) and <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like bar code readers, microcassette and floppy disk drives, paper-roll thermal printers, and miscellaneous communication interfaces (RS-232, HP-IL, HP-IB).|$|E
25|$|The CD {{was planned}} to be the {{successor}} of the vinyl record for playing music, rather than primarily as a data storage medium. From its origins as a musical format, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In 1983, following the CD's introduction, Immink and Braat presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd AES Convention. In June 1985, the computer-readable CD-ROM (<b>read-only</b> <b>memory)</b> and, in 1990, CD-Recordable were introduced, also developed by both Sony and Philips. Recordable CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as DVD and Blu-ray use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio CD.|$|E

25|$|Intel Corporation saw {{the massive}} {{potential}} of the invention and introduced the first commercial NOR type flash chip in 1988. NOR-based flash has long erase and write times, but provides full address and data buses, allowing random access to any memory location. This makes it a suitable replacement for older <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (ROM) chips, which are used to store program code that rarely needs to be updated, such as a computer's BIOS or the firmware of set-top boxes. Its endurance may be from as little as 100 erase cycles for an on-chip flash memory, to a more typical 10,000 or 100,000 erase cycles, up to 1,000,000 erase cycles. NOR-based flash was the basis of early flash-based removable media; CompactFlash was originally based on it, though later cards moved to less expensive NANDflash.|$|E

500|$|Wall {{designed}} Sensible Software 1986–1999 in {{the style}} of an art monograph, with full pages of in-game art, concept art, and other visual assets. Each major game received its own chapter. As part of his design process, Wall personally revisited the company's catalogue to capture screenshots. The project had an immediate response during its 2012 Kickstarter campaign, and met its goal of $30,000 to begin production. Reviewers were impressed by the details of the company's unreleased concepts. Kotaku praised the volume and its breadth of personnel interviewed, though Metro wrote the absence of Sensible co-founder Yates was conspicuous. Still, the book {{did not appear to be}} one-sided.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to store information using dot-like nanostructures created by the local oxidation of a surface.
