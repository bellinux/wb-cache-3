25|$|Electro Body was {{released}} in professional packaging, comparable to games released by Western publishers. The box contained an instruction manual, <b>reference</b> <b>card</b> with controls and a cassette tape containing the game soundtrack, thus allowing even players without sound cards to enjoy the music. Creating the boxes {{at the time was}} not a simple task for the developers; the boxes were shrink-wrapped by hand, {{with the help of a}} kitchen heat sealer and a sandwich toaster. The back of the box was decorated with screenshots made with a photo camera. Advertising material created for the game included posters and radio advertisements.|$|E

[...] Acornsoft packaged Elite in a box larger than its usual releases, complete with a novella by Robert Holdstock called The Dark Wheel, a 64-page space trader's flight training manual, <b>reference</b> <b>card</b> and a ship identification poster.

5000|$|... "Cry Havoc!", {{originally}} {{offered as}} a quarterly magazine, is available six times a year and is published by Rackham that includes information about its different games. The publication includes two magazines and new <b>reference</b> <b>cards.</b> The larger magazine has general articles on painting and modeling, as well as features on the games, tactics articles, battle reports, and background information on the world of Aarklash.

These cards are not available separately.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} and determine if use of specific <b>reference</b> <b>cards</b> for diabetes, stroke, and heat stroke [1] heightened {{understanding of the}} {{signs and symptoms of}} these conditions and [2] helped case managers (CMs) on the community-based integrated multidisciplinary program of assertive community treatment (IMPACT) team better evaluate patients. Background: Healthcare professionals who service those with a severe mental illness (SMI) diagnosis face many unique challenges. One particular challenge is medical assessment of patients with a SMI diagnosis. Often CMs do not have a background or work experience differentiating medical concerns from psychiatric signs and symptoms. Methods: <b>Reference</b> <b>cards</b> were developed {{at the request of the}} IMPACT team. Feedback was elicited through a one-time focus group session conducted by an independent party on the use of the <b>reference</b> <b>cards</b> as an educational tool. Anonymity was maintained. The responses were evaluated for themes. The moderator asked questions regarding the <b>reference</b> <b>cards</b> in each of the following areas: usability when answering questions about hypo- and hyperglycemia, stroke and heat stroke, understanding key points, recommendations for enhancement, and presentation of information. Results: Of the 8 CMs on the IMPACT team, 5 participated. Identified themes were quick reference and easily identifiable information. The use of pictures to illustrate the concepts was helpful. The language was appropriate for the cards and readily understandable. Suggestions for changes to the existing cards included use of a larger font, lighter background color, and moving medication information to the same side of the card. The limited availability of the heat stroke card in the summer was an identified limitation. Conclusions: The use of <b>reference</b> <b>cards</b> as an educational tool for CMs has not been extensively reviewed. Although data are limited from this pilot project, the CMs are enthusiastic about this resource and requested cards on additional topics...|$|R

Very few of these color <b>reference</b> <b>cards</b> showed an adult male as the reference image. Light skin tones therefore served as the recognized skin ideal standard. Stock color film chemistry for still cameras was designed originally with a positive bias toward [...] "Caucasian" [...] skin tones because of its high level of reflectivity.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>Reference</b> <b>Card</b> or [...] "Romer" [...] is {{a device}} for {{increasing}} the accuracy when reading a grid reference from a map. Made from transparent plastic, paper or other materials, they are also found on most baseplate compasses. Essentially, it is a specially marked-out ruler which matches {{the scale of the}} map in use. The scales are laid out in reverse, such that by lining up the numbers given in the grid reference with the gridlines for the square in question, the corner of the Romer lies on the location whose grid reference you wish to read. Some transparent versions have a small hole at the origin when this is not {{at the corner of the}} <b>Reference</b> <b>Card.</b> This allows access to the map such that the location could be marked with a pencil if using the <b>Reference</b> <b>Card</b> in reverse having been given a grid reference to start with. They are used in many types of land navigation and map reading, to give a more accurate grid reference than one just estimated by eye from the grid lines on the map.|$|E

5000|$|Due to its logical {{structure}} and conciseness, finding {{information in a}} <b>reference</b> <b>card</b> is trivial for humans and requires no computer interaction. It is therefore convenient for a user to print out a <b>reference</b> <b>card.</b> While reference cards can be printed on card stock, {{it is common to}} print them on ordinary printer paper. With the advent of portable electronic devices that can display documents, digital reference cards stored in PDF or HTML formats have become more common.

40|$|The {{present study}} is to {{investigate}} the brain activation associated with the informative value of negative feedback in rule acquisition. In each trial of a segmented Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, participants were provided with three <b>reference</b> <b>cards</b> and one target card, {{and were asked to}} match one of three <b>reference</b> <b>cards</b> to the target card based on a classification rule. Participants received feedback after each match. Participants would acquire the rule after one negative feedback (1 -NF condition) or two successive negative feedbacks (2 -NF condition). The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results indicated that lateral prefrontal-to-parietal cortices were more active in the 2 -NF condition than in the 1 -NF condition. The activation in the right lateral prefrontal cortex and left posterior parietal cortex increased gradually with the amount of negative feedback. These results demonstrate that the informative value of negative feedback in rule acquisition might be modulated by the lateral prefronto-parietal loop...|$|R
