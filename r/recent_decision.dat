25|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} is {{not available}} when one party promises to accept a lesser sum in full payment of a debt, unless the debtor offers payment at an earlier date than was previously agreed. This is the rule formulated in Pinnel's Case, and affirmed in Foakes v Beer. This rule has, however, been thrown into doubt by the <b>recent</b> <b>decision</b> of Collier v Wright Ltd.|$|E
25|$|After {{seven years}} of pain and hard {{struggle}} it was my hope that the court system would listen to my plea and act as an independent body from the executive branch. Unfortunately, this <b>recent</b> <b>decision</b> and decisions taken on other similar cases, prove that the court system in the United States has become {{more or less a}} tool that the executive branch can easily manipulate through unfounded allegations and fear mongering. If anything, this decision is a loss to all Americans and to the rule of law.|$|E
25|$|Grudge Warriors is a car combat {{video game}} {{released}} by Take-Two Interactive on April 27, 2000. The game retailed {{for the low}} price of $9.99, a response by Take-Two to the <b>recent</b> <b>decision</b> of Sony to drop PlayStation licensing fees. Similar to the earlier PlayStation title Twisted Metal, players control a powerful tank-like armored vehicle, which they used to destroy enemy vehicles, weapons, and generators, solve puzzles, and collect tokens to upgrade their weapons. There are a total of twenty-three missions, and the game allows two players to battle each other in split screen multiplayer.|$|E

25|$|In October 2000, Harding {{urged the}} {{government}} to ratify the United Nations Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which aims at abolishing the death penalty. In urging the change, he cited a <b>recent</b> <b>decision</b> by the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches calling {{for an end to}} the death penalty, as well as that he remained personally unconvinced that the death penalty was an effective deterrent to criminals. When Bruce Golding became Prime Minister of Jamaica in 2007, Harding again urged {{the government to}} ratify the UN Protocol.|$|E
25|$|Bladel then {{objected to}} the {{admissibility}} of the confession but the trial court overruled his objection. He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} three life sentences to run consecutively. On appeal from his conviction and sentence, Bladel challenged the confession. The Michigan Court of Appeals first rejected that challenge and affirmed the conviction, but, after reconsideration in the light of a <b>recent</b> <b>decision</b> by the State Supreme Court, it reversed and remanded for a new trial. The Michigan Supreme Court then granted the prosecutor's application for leave to appeal, and considered the case with respondent Jackson's appeal of his conviction.|$|E
25|$|Depending on its {{enabling}} legislation, a tribunal's decisions may {{be reviewed}} {{by a court}} through an appeal or a process called judicial review. The reviewing court {{may be required to}} show some deference to the tribunal if the tribunal possesses some highly specialized expertise or knowledge that the court does not have. The degree of deference will also depend on such factors as the specific wording of the legislation creating the tribunal. Tribunals whose enabling legislation contains a privative clause are entitled to a high degree of deference, although a <b>recent</b> <b>decision</b> of the Supreme Court of Canada (Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9) has arguably lowered that degree of deference.|$|E
40|$|There is no {{universal}} {{definition of}} religion under English law. Instead, different definitions {{have been developed}} by courts and tribunals in relation to different religious rights. Although there have been moves towards the harmonisation of these different definitions, <b>recent</b> <b>decisions</b> have reversed this trend. This article explores {{for the first time}} how this has led to a confused and contradictory case law. It begins by surveying how religion has been defined in registration law, charity law, human rights law and discrimination law: the moves towards harmonisation and the counter-tendencies in the <b>recent</b> <b>decisions.</b> It places the <b>recent</b> <b>decisions</b> within their broader legal context and points out a number of contradictions and uncertainties. Arguing that a universal definition of religion under English law is now needed, it synthesises the case laws to identify the elements of a universal definition that already exist. The article examines how these can be refashioned in order to remove inconsistencies that exist in different areas of law. Drawing upon insights from the sociology of religion the article concludes by proposing a new definition...|$|R
40|$|<b>Recent</b> <b>decisions</b> {{under the}} UNCLOS dispute {{settlement}} regime, such as Chagos Archipelago, Arctic Sunrise and South China Sea, have had cause {{to consider the}} parameters of jurisdiction that exists under Part XV of UNCLOS. A determination of jurisdiction for any court or tribunal constituted under UNCLOS must have regard to alternative means of dispute settlement available, whether the dispute is one relating to the interpretation or application of UNCLOS and whether any exceptions to jurisdiction apply. This paper will consider these three dimensions in light of <b>recent</b> <b>decisions</b> and reflect on ways that the scope of jurisdiction is being expanded or restricted to resolve the disputes at issue. 13 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Although the Department {{recognizes that}} amparos are an {{integral}} aspect of Mexican law designed to protect individuals’ legal rights, the USCA is concerned that amparo appeals are being used excessively in Convention return cases, and that Mexico is allowing taking parents to use the amparo process to delay cases and influence the final outcome {{in ways that are}} not consistent with the principles of the Convention. The Department is encouraged by a <b>recent</b> <b>decision</b> by a Mexican federal judge, which overcame an amparo allowing a child to immediately return to the United States, and hopes this precedent will continue. By streamlining the amparo process in Convention cases, the Government of Mexico could better meet its treaty obligations.|$|E
25|$|Any {{police officer}} may, without warrant, arrest and detain pending {{enquiries}} any person {{in respect of}} whom he has reason to believe there are grounds which would justify the person's detention. In the 1960 case of Re Ong Yew Teck, the High Court held that since a police officer ordering an arrest {{is not required to}} disclose facts which he considers to be against the public interest to disclose, it is futile for a court to objectively decide whether there are grounds justifying detention. Therefore, a subjective test is to be applied – if the police officer honestly supposes he has reason to believe the required element, the court cannot go behind the officer's statement. However, Ong Yew Teck may no longer be good law in view of the Court of Appeal's more <b>recent</b> <b>decision</b> in Kamal Jit Singh (above).|$|E
25|$|As a child, {{with his}} two older {{brothers}} already away from home at school in Rouen, Duchamp was close to his sister Suzanne, who was a willing accomplice in games and activities conjured by his fertile imagination. At 8 years old, Duchamp followed in his brothers' footsteps when he left home and began schooling at the Lycée Pierre-Corneille, in Rouen. Two other students in his class also became well-known artists and lasting friends: Robert Antoine Pinchon and Pierre Dumont. For the next 8 years, he was locked into an educational regime which focused on intellectual development. Though {{he was not an}} outstanding student, his best subject was mathematics and he won two mathematics prizes at the school. He also won a prize for drawing in 1903, and at his commencement in 1904 he won a coveted first prize, validating his <b>recent</b> <b>decision</b> to become an artist.|$|E

In closing, the Court of Appeals cited the U.S. Supreme Court's <b>recent</b> <b>decision</b> in Fellows. [...] Chief Judge Hiram Denio, joined by Judge Alexander S.

500|$|Consequently, Delegate Don Dwyer {{introduced}} {{a resolution to}} impeach Judge Murdock in 2006, alleging [...] "misbehavior in office, [...] neglect of duty, and incompetency" [...] for her trial court decision; in 2007, he {{introduced a}} law that would ban discussion of same-sex unions in public schools.

Biddle which held that land claims granted by Virginia in the District of Kentucky prior to Kentucky becoming a separate state took precedence over those later granted by the state of Kentucky if the two were in conflict. Encouraged by Desha's strong stance against the judiciary, Relief partisans set about removing the judges on the Court of Appeals who had earlier struck down their debt relief legislation. The first punitive measure proposed against the offending judges was to reduce their salaries to 25 cents per year, but this course was quickly abandoned. Next, legislators attempted to remove the judges by address, but they found they lacked the necessary two-thirds majority in both houses to effect this removal.|$|E
