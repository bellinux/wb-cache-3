40|$|WHEN TEACHING RENAL PHYSIOLOGY, it {{is often}} {{difficult}} to sway students to the wonders of the kidney. For most students, it is reasonable straightforward to understand the function of all main tubular transporters on a cellular and segment level and to grasp glomerular filtration and renal hemodynamics. A new level of complexity emerges as the interplay between the tubular segment and vasculature is added for renal autoregu-lation and the urinary concentration mechanism. On top of that comes the overall regulation of renal function by classical systemic hormones. After this cocktail, the exiting area of renal auto- and paracrine regulation is hardly mentioned, particularly because the function and physiological relevance of the many auto and paracrine systems are a challenge for even the most hardcore <b>renal</b> <b>physiologist.</b> Looking through the literature, one can easily understand why this jungle of paracrine regulation i...|$|E
40|$|ARL W. GOTTSCHALK made {{critical}} {{discoveries in}} renal physi-Cology and pathophysiology with innovative techniques of micropuncture. One of his earliest findings was definitive proof of how urine is concentrated by countercurrent multiplication. That discovery catapulted {{him to the}} front ranks of <b>renal</b> <b>physiologists</b> early in his career. In the following years he made many more important observations about the mechanism of urea excretion by the kidneys, the role of renal nerves in salt and water excretion, urinary acidification, and pathophysiologic mechanisms of acute and chronic renal disease. Because of the brilliance and quality of his research he was widely recognized {{as a leader in}} renal research...|$|R
40|$|The story, {{described}} here in detail, started in 1962 {{with the publication}} of a seminal paper by Frederic Bartter et al. in the December issue of the American Journal of Medicine. The authors reported two pediatric patients with hitherto undescribed features, namely growth and developmental delay associated with hypokalemic alkalosis and normal blood pressure despite high aldosterone production. It soon became clear that this condition was not so exceptional. The syndrome named after Bartter was actually identified in children as well as in adults, females as well as males and in all five continents. It took almost four decades to clarify the exact nature of the disease. Bartter disease is an autosomal recessive disorder with four genotypes and mainly two phenotypes. Moreover, there are acquired secondary forms of Bartter syndrome as well as pseudo-Bartter syndromes. The history demonstrates the power of genetics but also illustrates the fundamental and irreplaceable contributions from nephrologists and <b>renal</b> <b>physiologists.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular citrate is {{a central}} {{component}} of the tricarboxylic acid cycle; its excretion in the urine was utilized by Krebs and coworkers to demonstrate this biochemical pathway in whole animals. Subsequently, urinary citrate has been viewed as a “window” on renal metabolism [1]. Additionally, <b>renal</b> <b>physiologists</b> and biochemists have been intrigued for decades by the dramatic changes in urinary citrate which occur with changes in acid-base homeostasis. In recent years, renal handling of citrate and citrate excretion in the urine have attracted renewed interest because of several considerations. First, modern techniques in renal physiology (such as, transport studies in brush border membrane vesicles and perfused proximal tubules) have provided insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of citrate transport [2]. Also, excretion of urinary citrate (and other organic anions) has been recognized to influence systemic acid-base status, at least in certain species [3]. And perhaps most importantly, urinary citrate has been increasingly recognized as an important endogenous inhibitor of calcium nephrolithiasis [4]. This review {{will focus on the}} renal handling of citrate, particularly the mechanisms of citrate transport in the proximal tubule, and briefly discuss other aspects of citrate metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Mammals {{and birds}} {{are the only}} {{vertebrates}} known to produce a concentrated urine by means of renal medullary countercurrent systems. These two countercurrent systems, however, exhibit functional and anatomical differences which appear {{to be related to}} the fact that mammals are ureotelic while birds are uricotelic. In mammalian kidneys, urea accumulation in the medulla plays an important role in the concentrating mechanism. In bird kidneys, there is no accumulation of urea in the medulla. The mammalian renal medulla is surrounded by a muscular, funnel–shaped pelvic wall, leaving an elaborate urinary space between the renal medulla and the inside of the pelvic wall, while the bird renal medulla is surrounded by tight sheets of connective tissue leaving no space for the urine to contact the renal medulla. The mammalian renal pelvis makes it possible for urine to contact the epithelial covering of the inner and outer medulla, and the peristaltic contractions of the muscular pelvic wall exerts a rhythmic pumping action on the renal papilla. The functional significance of these two aspects of the renal pelvis have in recent years become the focus of attention by some <b>renal</b> <b>physiologists...</b>|$|R
40|$|Although the {{processes}} that generate the osmotic gradients in the inner medulla remain controversial, the countercurrent mechanism for the osmotic concentration and dilution of urine is now generally accepted. It was not always so. The mechanism for urinary dilution posed no conceptual difficulties for <b>renal</b> <b>physiologists.</b> Active transport of sodium chloride by a nephron segment whose epithelium had restricted water permeability {{in the absence of}} antidiuretic hormone (ADH), presumably located in the “distal” portion of the uriniferous tubule, was logical and based on proven and analogous processes. It was also obvious that when its water permeability was increased by ADH, water transport would be closely coupled to solute transport and reabsorbate and tubular fluid would be isosmotic. It appeared necessary to postulate the active transport of water as the final step in the production of urine which was hyperosmotic to the body fluids. Despite {{the fact that there was}} no proven example of active water transport in the animal kingdom, active water transport by the cells of the collecting ducts was proposed and was generally accepted. The simple biological solution of establishing by solute transport a hypertonic environment in an anatomically restricted portion of the kidney such that all water transport could be postulated as passive was not obvious and was scorned when proposed...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} physiologic {{evidence that the}} tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism exerts an important, functional role in the renal control of volume homeostasis. At this juncture, the evidence is not complete but must be considered strongly circumstantial, derived {{from a variety of}} recent studies. The tubuloglomerular feedback system functions to prevent renal volume losses apparently through a fine regulatory mechanism that acts to preserve a constancy of tubular flow rates [1 – 3]. Flow rates appear to be controlled around a range of normal values for either the late proximal or early distal tubular flow rate by a combined vasoconstrictor-vasodilator capacity which influences nephron filtration rate [4]. Investigations now extend beyond the single nephron microperfusion studies conducted during the past several years which established the existence of a relationship between late proximal microperfusion rate, distal tubular delivery and tubular reabsorption and the resulting nephron filtration rate [4 – 7]. Several examples, potentially pertinent to clinical medicine, exist which provide reasonable evidence that activation or suppression of tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms contribute significantly to alterations in normal renal physiology. It is doubtful whether most nephrologists and <b>renal</b> <b>physiologists</b> outside this specific field of investigation currently readily appreciate the impact of the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism on normal and altered renal function. We will attempt to summarize some of the recent examples in which data support the hypothesis of a functional role for feedback mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|A major {{function}} of the kidney is to collaborate with the respiratory system to maintain systemic acid-base status within limits compatible with normal cell and organ function. It achieves this by regulating the excretion and recovery of bicarbonate (mainly in the proximal tubule) and the secretion of buffered protons (mainly in the distal tubule and collecting duct). How proximal tubular cells and distal professional proton transporting (intercalated) cells sense and respond to changes in pH, bicarbonate, and CO(2) status {{is a question that}} has intrigued many generations of <b>renal</b> <b>physiologists.</b> Over the past few years, however, some candidate molecular pH sensors have been identified, including acid/alkali-sensing receptors (GPR 4, InsR-RR), kinases (Pyk 2, ErbB 1 / 2), pH-sensitive ion channels (ASICs, TASK, ROMK), and the bicarbonate-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (sAC). Some acid-sensing mechanisms in other tissues, such as CAII-PDK 2 L 1 in taste buds, might also have similar roles to play in the kidney. Finally, the {{function of}} a variety of additional membrane channels and transporters is altered by pH variations both within and outside the cell, and the expression of several metabolic enzymes are altered by acid-base status in parts of the nephron. Thus, it is possible that a master pH sensor will never be identified. Rather, the kidney seems equipped with a battery of molecules that scan the epithelial cell environment to mount a coordinated physiologic response that maintains acid-base homeostasis. This review collates current knowledge on renal acid-base sensing {{in the context of a}} whole organ sensing and response process...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} {{processes that}} underly the reabsorption of bicarbonate and the excretion of acid by the kidney {{have long been}} of interest to <b>renal</b> <b>physiologists.</b> Working models of the cellular mechanisms of transport {{were based on the}} transport functions of the sum of all segments of all nephrons, and remained useful for many years because of their simplicity. Several mechanisms for tubular acidification have been proposed on the basis of such studies. They involve either secretion of H+ ions or reabsorption of buffer anions. The classical work of Pitts and Alexander [1] showed that reabsorption of filtered alkaline phosphate alone could not account for urinary acidification and provided one of the first indications of H+ ion secretion by tubular cells. The origin of the secreted H+ ions has been ascribed to CO 2 hydration in the tubular cell or to water splitting by a redox pump located at the luminal membrane with subsequent neutralization of the OH­ ion in the cell by CO 2 [2, 3]. On the other hand, it was recognized that bicarbonate reabsorption could be due either to H+ secretion or to reabsorption of HCO 3 ­ as such [2, 3]. It was also suggested that H+ secretion would be difficult to distinguish from a sequence of events in which CO 2 diffuses into the lumen and becomes hydrated, and in which only the HCO­ 3 species of the hydrated pair is reabsorbed [4, 5]. With the advent of new techniques for the study of individual tubule segments in vivo, it is now becoming feasible to explore the transport processes under conditions in which the individual forces and flows can be estimated and monitored. The ideal of controlling the electrochemical forces {{on both sides of the}} epithelial cell layer has been approached more closely in vitro, in sheet preparations of certain urinary bladders mounted in Lucite chambers. As a result of these developments, some of the described working hypotheses have been tested and many observations have been made that require a new framework of interpretation. What is the origin of the so-called “disequilibrium pH” which is present in the distal tubule under ordinary conditions and in the proximal tubule during carbonic anhydrase inhibition? Is it caused by a disequilibrium concentration of carbonic acid or an elevated PCO 2 of the tubular fluid? If CO 2 is formed in the tubular fluid from the reaction between secreted H+ and filtered HCO 3 -, large quantities of CO 2 will be formed, the diffusion of which could well be delayed as a function of the permeability of the tubular cells. Another important question is the regulation of acidification in metabolic and respiratory acid-base disorders. What are the major factors controlling the net rate of acidification? Although it is impossible to examine the effects of ambient pH, PCO 2 and HCO 3 ­ separately, a number of interesting studies have been undertaken in the tubule and in the turtle bladder. It appears that the results are influenced primarily by differences in the passive permeability of these structures. The distal tubule, collecting duct and turtle bladder are considerably tighter epithelia than the proximal tubule. Among the subjects reviewed in this paper are the nature of the transported ion species in acidification, the question of whether or not H+ secretion is coupled directly to the transport of Na+ and other electrolytes, the behavior of active and passive components of transport during acidification against an electrochemical gradient and the factors that are rate determining for each of the transport rates. After an exploration of these questions in an epithelial membrane that is capable of urinary acidification in vitro, we shall examine the transport processes of acidification in kidney tubules by microelectrode and microperfusion techniques. Despite differences between these urinary structures, it is evident that some of the general principles that have been forthcoming from recent studies may ultimately simplify our understanding of the transport processes of urinary acidification...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{affected}} by {{end-stage renal disease}} (ESRD) show quite lower physical activity and exercise capacity when compared to healthy individuals. In addition, a sedentary lifestyle is favoured by lack of a specific counseling on exercise implementation in the nephrology care setting. Increasing physical activity level should represent a goal for every dialysis patient care management. Three crucial elements of clinical care may contribute to sustain a hemodialysis exercise program: a) involvement of exercise professionals, b) real commitment of nephrologists and dialysis professionals, c) individual patient adaptation of the exercise program. Dialysis staff have a crucial role to encourage and assist patients during intra-dialysis exercise, but other professionals {{should be included in}} the ideal "exercise team"for dialysis patients. Evaluation of general condition, comorbidities (especially cardiovascular), nutritional status and physical exercise capacity are mandatory to propose an exercise program, in either extra-dialysis or intra-dialysis setting. To this aim, nephrologist should lead a team of specialists and professionals including cardiologist, physiotherapist, exercise <b>physiologist,</b> <b>renal</b> dietician and nurse. In this scenario, dialysis nurses play a pivotal role since they guarantee a constant and direct approach. Unfortunately dialysis staff may often lack of information and formation about exercise management while they take care patients during the dialysis session. Building an effective exercise team, promoting the culture of exercise and increasing physical activity levels lead to a more complete and modern clinical care management of ESRD patients...|$|R
