40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES [...] This study {{aimed to}} assess total {{influenza}} mortality {{among the elderly}} (> or = 75 years old) in France, and to evaluate how many deaths may have been avoided through vaccination during the past 10 years. DESIGN [...] The monthly mortality rates related to different causes among the elderly {{were obtained from the}} national mortality statistics for the period 1978 - 90. For each cause, the proportion of the <b>registered</b> <b>death</b> rate attributable <b>to</b> influenza was estimated using time series models. Each model analysed the <b>registered</b> <b>death</b> rate for the considered cause as a linear function of the <b>registered</b> influenza <b>death</b> rate for that month, the secular trend, and the seasonal variations. This yielded yearly regression coefficients for influenza. Formulas were subsequently developed <b>to</b> estimate the <b>death</b> rates avoided as a result of influenza vaccination according to the level of vaccine coverage and the hypothetical effectiveness of the vaccine. MAIN RESULTS [...] Between 1980 and 1990 <b>registered</b> influenza <b>death</b> rates ranged from 11 - 81 per 100, 000. The number of <b>deaths</b> attributable <b>to</b> influenza but registered as resulting from another cause was up to eight times the number of <b>deaths</b> <b>registered</b> as influenza. Total influenza death rates were estimated as ranging from 28 per 100, 000 (1988 - 89) to 482 per 100, 000 (1985 - 86). At the same time it was estimated that the use of influenza vaccine avoided from 7 per 100, 000 deaths in 1981 - 82 to 697 per 100, 000 deaths in 1989 - 90, depending on the intensity of the epidemic, the vaccine coverage, and the vaccine effectiveness.

40|$|Background The {{present study}} {{investigated}} histories of prior psychiatric treatment {{in cases of}} sudden <b>death</b> reported <b>to</b> the coroner Methods A matching survey linked the <b>register</b> of <b>deaths</b> reported <b>to</b> the coroner with a comprehensive statewide psychiatric case register covering both inpatient and community-based services. Results Sudden death was five times higher in people with histories of psychiatric contact. Suicide accounted for part of this excess mortality but deaths from natural causes and accidents were also elevated. Schizophrenic and affective disorders had similar suicide rates. Comorbid substance misuse doubled the risk of sudden death in affective and schizophrenic disorders. Conclusions The rates of sudden death are sufficiently elevated to raise questions about current priorities in mental health care. There is a need both for greater attention to suicide risk, most notably among young people with schizophrenia, to the early detection of cardiovascular disorders and to the vigorous management of comorbid substance misuse...|$|R
50|$|The local {{registrar}} had to {{be informed}} of a death within five days and burial (or cremation) could not take place until the death had been properly <b>registered.</b> The <b>death</b> had <b>to</b> be <b>registered</b> either by a relative or some other person present at the death or there during the final illness of the deceased, or {{the person responsible for}} disposing of the body, or a responsible person from an institution (e.g. a care home). From 1845 the cause of <b>death</b> had <b>to</b> be certified meaning that a doctor had <b>to</b> certified the <b>death</b> before registration. Deaths should normally be registered in the district where the death occurred. Once a <b>death</b> has been <b>registered,</b> the registar will normally issue a Certificate for Burial or Cremation, unless the death is being investigated by the coroner or there is an inquest. This certificate gives permission for the body to be buried or for an application for cremation to be made. The certificate is then taken to the funeral director so that the funeral can be held.|$|R
50|$|In modern U.S. law, wills are not {{required}} to be <b>registered</b> prior <b>to</b> <b>death</b> in most states, but are registered and put in the public record after the person making the will dies and the estate is probated. However, it is often still {{a good idea to have}} the signing and witnessing of a will notarized, to reduce the risk of disputes over the will's validity after death. Wills can be used to nominate guardians for minor children, but because children are not property, the will cannot have the final word on the question. Guardianship is decided by courts, though the usual outcome is that guardianship is awarded to the other surviving parent, or, if no parents survive, to the guardian nominated in the last surviving parent's will.|$|R
40|$|Aims In England and Wales, {{doctors are}} charged with a {{responsibility}} either <b>to</b> report a <b>death</b> <b>to</b> the coroner or issue a medical certificate specifying cause of death. A lack of formal prescriptive or presumptive oversight {{has resulted in the}} promulgation by individual coroners of local reporting regimes. The study reported here identified overall and gendered variations in local reporting rates to coroners across the jurisdictions of England and Wales, consistent over time. Methods Analysis was performed on Ministry of Justice (MOJ) data pertaining to the numbers and proportions of <b>deaths</b> reported <b>to</b> the coroner by jurisdiction over a 10 -year period (2001 – 2010). Office of National Statistics (ONS) data provided the numbers of <b>deaths</b> <b>registered</b> in England and Wales over the same period to serve as a denominator for the calculation of proportions. Where coroner jurisdictions (and local authorities) had been amalgamated during this period, the combined reported and <b>registered</b> <b>death</b> figures have been included in line with the current jurisdiction areas. Results While reporting rates for individual jurisdictions were found to be stable over the 10 -year period, wide local variations in reporting <b>deaths</b> <b>to</b> coroners were found with no obvious demographic explanation. The gender of the deceased was identified as a major factor in local variation. Conclusions The decision <b>to</b> report a <b>death</b> <b>to</b> the coroner varies across jurisdictions.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{classify}} {{the causes}} of death in Maputo City, Mozambique, using the methods of the Global Burden of Disease study, {{in order to provide}} information for health policy-makers and to obtain a baseline for future studies in Maputo City and provincial capitals. METHODS: Data were taken from the Maputo City <b>death</b> <b>register</b> and autopsy records for 1994. FINDINGS: A total of 9011 deaths were recorded in the <b>death</b> <b>register,</b> representing a coverage of approximately 86 %. Of these, 8114 deaths (92 %) were classified by cause. Communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders accounted for 5319 deaths; noncommunicable diseases for 1834; and injuries for 961. The 10 leading causes of <b>registered</b> <b>deaths</b> were perinatal disorders (1643 deaths); malaria (928); diarrhoeal diseases (814); tuberculosis (456); lower respiratory infections (416); road-traffic accidents (371); anaemia (269); cerebrovascular diseases (269); homicide (188); and bacterial meningitis (178). CONCLUSIONS: Infectious diseases of all types, injuries, and cerebrovascular disease ranked as leading causes of <b>death,</b> according <b>to</b> both the autopsy records and the city <b>death</b> <b>register.</b> AIDS-related <b>deaths</b> were underreported. With HIV infection increasing rapidly, AIDS will add to the already high burden of infectious diseases and premature mortality in Maputo City.

We developed and evaluated a system for producing <b>death</b> <b>registers</b> for GPs. AIM: To evaluate GPs' and practice managers' views on, and uses of, the <b>death</b> <b>register.</b> METHOD: General practitioners in Newcastle (n = 161) and Sunderland Family Health Service Authority (n = 144) areas were sent a questionnaire on their sources and use of information about patients' <b>deaths.</b> <b>Death</b> <b>registers</b> were sent <b>to</b> Newcastle practices; Sunderland practices were the control group. A follow-up questionnaire was sent to Newcastle (n = 173) and Sunderland (n = 140) GPs after two years.

40|$|Objective. It has {{previously}} been demonstrated that a peak in <b>registered</b> infant <b>deaths,</b> at 2 - 3 months of age at death, developed between 1997 and 2002 in South Africa, alongside the evolving HIV epidemic. The objective of this analysis was to explore the age distribution of post-neonatal infant deaths in South Africa by province, and relate the observed distributions to HIV and intervention characteristics. Design. Ecological study based on <b>registered</b> infant <b>deaths</b> and published HIV and intervention characteristics. Methods. Numbers of <b>registered</b> infant <b>deaths</b> beyond 1 month of age at death were plotted by year of death, province of South Africa and age at death in months, for the years 1997 - 2007. Results. The total number of <b>registered</b> <b>deaths</b> in infants aged 1 - 11 months increased from 15 404 in 1997 to 34 479 in 2006. Eight of the 9 provinces experienced an annual peak in <b>registered</b> infant <b>deaths</b> at 2 - 3 months of age between 1997 and 2007. This peak in mortality was not observed in the Western Cape. In 7 of 9 provinces <b>registered</b> post-neonatal infant <b>deaths</b> did not rise markedly in 2007 compared with 2005. Conclusions. We identified a single province out of 9 South African provinces in which a peak in early infant deaths at age 2 - 3 months did not occur during the period 1997 - 2007. This was the province with the earliest and highest coverage of antiretroviral interventions from 1999 onwards.

40|$|Background: To {{report on}} the trend in all-cause {{mortality}} in a rural district of Malawi that has successfully scaled-up HIV/ AIDS care including antiretroviral treatment (ART) to its population, through corroborative evidence from a) <b>registered</b> <b>deaths</b> at traditional authorities (TAs), b) coffin sales and c) church funerals. Methods and Findings: Retrospective study in 5 of 12 TAs (covering approximately 50 % of the population) during the period 2000 – 2007. A total of 210 villages, 24 coffin workshops and 23 churches were included. There were a total of 18, 473 <b>registered</b> <b>deaths</b> at TAs, 15781 coffins sold, and 2762 church funerals. Between 2000 and 2007, there was a highly significant linear downward trend in death rates, sale of coffins and church funerals (X 2 for linear trend: 338. 4 P, 0. 0001, 989 P, 0. 0001 and 197, P, 0. 0001 respectively). Using data from TAs as the most reliable source of data on deaths, overall death rate reduction was 37 % (95 % CI: 33 – 40) for the period. The mean annual incremental death rate reduction was 0. 52 / 1000 / year. Death rates decreased over time {{as the percentage of}} people living with HIV/AIDS enrolled into care and ART increased.

Methods include systems analysis, literature review, {{and the application of}} the Health Metrics Network (HMN) self-assessment tool by key stakeholders. We identified two weaknesses underlying incompleteness of death registration and inaccuracy of COD attribution: problems in recording events or certifying deaths, and problems in transferring information from <b>death</b> certificates <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>registers.</b> <b>Deaths</b> occurring outside health facilities, representing 65 % of all deaths in Thailand, contribute to the inaccuracy of cause-of-death data because they must be certified by village heads with limited knowledge and expertise in cause-of-death attribution. However, problems also exist with in-hospital cause-of-death certification by physicians. Priority should be given to training medical personnel in death certification, review of medical records by health personnel in district hospitals, and use of verbal autopsy techniques for assessing internal consistency. This should be coupled with stronger collaboration with district registrars for the 65 % of deaths that occur outside hospitals. Training of physicians and data coders and harmonization of death certificates and registries would improve COD data for the 35 % of deaths that take place in hospital. Public awareness of the importance of <b>registering</b> all <b>deaths</b> and the application of registration requirements prior to funerals would also improve coverage, though enforcement would be difficult...|$|R

40|$|Patients with {{osteoarthritis}} undergoing knee replacement {{have been}} reported to have an overall reduced mortality compared with that of the general population. This has been attributed to the selection of healthier patients for surgery. However, previous studies have had a maximum follow-up time of ten years. We have used information from the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register to study the mortality of a large national series of patients with total knee replacement for up to 28 years after surgery and compared their mortality with that of the normal population. In addition, for a subgroup of patients operated on between 1980 and 2002 we analysed their <b>registered</b> causes of <b>death</b> <b>to</b> determine if they differed from those expected. We found a reduced overall mortality during the first 12 post-operative years after which it increased and became significantly higher than that of the general population. Age-specific analysis indicated an inverse correlation between age and mortality, where the younger the patients were, the higher their mortality. The shift at 12 years was caused by a relative over-representation of younger patients with a longer follow-up. Analysis of specific causes of death showed a higher mortality for cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and urogenital diseases. The observation that early onset of osteoarthritis of the knee which has been treated by total knee replacement is linked to an increased mortality should be a reason for increased general awareness of health problems in these patients...|$|R
