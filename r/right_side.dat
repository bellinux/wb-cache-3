5|$|Carnotaurus was {{the first}} {{theropod}} dinosaur discovered with {{a significant number of}} fossil skin impressions. These impressions, found beneath the skeleton's <b>right</b> <b>side,</b> come from different body parts, including the lower jaw, the front of the neck, the shoulder girdle, and the rib cage. The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail. Originally, the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the skull also was covered with large patches of skin—this was not recognized when the skull was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed. Still, the surface texture of much of the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the skull is very {{different from that of the}} left side, and probably shows some features of the scalation pattern of the head.|$|E
5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of her chest and right knee.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposite}} side altar on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> houses another early 19th century {{image of the}} Nuestra Señora de la Consolación (Our Lady of Consolation) in the central niche. Joining the Marian image are Augustinian Saints: Saint Augustine, Saint Monica and Saint Nicolas de Tolentino. Another smaller neoclassical retablo built in 1875 on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> houses the image of Saint Joseph in the main niche and Saint Isidore.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the frequency with}} which unilateral and bilateral cerebral disease gives rise to <b>right</b> <b>sided</b> visual hemispatial inattention. A retrospective survey identified brain injured patients for whom target omissions on visual target cancellation tasks significantly exceeded control values. Subjects consisted of 40 right handed patients referred for clinical evaluation or research study of hemispatial inattention. <b>Right</b> <b>sided</b> visual hemispatial inattention occurred with greater frequency and severity in patients with bilateral lesions than in patients with unilateral left <b>sided</b> or <b>right</b> <b>sided</b> lesions. All eight patients with bilateral lesions manifested <b>right</b> <b>sided</b> hemispatial inattention and failed to detect more targets overall than patients in the other two groups. Of the 13 patients with left sided lesion, seven ignored more targets on the right and six ignored more targets on the left. All but one of the 19 patients with <b>right</b> <b>sided</b> lesions ignored more targets on the left. The association of severe <b>right</b> <b>sided</b> visual hemispatial inattention with bilateral cerebral disease extends previous findings and showed that, in this sample, the most common setting for <b>right</b> <b>sided</b> hemispatial neglect occurred in patients with bilateral cerebral lesions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Right</b> <b>sided</b> {{aortic arch}} is an {{uncommon}} congenital anomaly. It {{can be classified}} into three types, depending on the left aortic arch’s degenerating pattern and the branching pattern of the great vessels. It {{can be associated with}} major congenital heart disease, {{depending on the type of}} <b>right</b> <b>sided</b> aortic arch. We report a case of an 18 -years-old female who has <b>right</b> <b>sided</b> aortic arch with atrial septal defect (ASD). In our case, the patient had a <b>right</b> <b>sided</b> aortic arch and aberrant left subclavian artery, also she had ASD (ostium secundum) and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary hypertension. The patient was successfully performed patch closure of ASD and tricuspid valve annuloplasty via midline sternotomy. The patient had uneventful postoperative course.

5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E

Despite vigorous broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, postural drainage and chest physiotherapy, {{there was no}} clinical improvement. Further work up included serology, pleural fluid culture, closed as well as thoracoscopic guided pleural biopsy revealed growth of Aspergillus fumigatus.

5|$|Another legend {{from the}} Linga Purana {{says that the}} {{embracing}} of love-struck Shiva and Mohini led to be their merging into one body. At this moment, Mohini became Vishnu again, resulting the composite deity Harihara, whose <b>right</b> <b>side</b> {{of the body is}} Shiva and left side is Vishnu in his male form. In the temple in Sankarnayinarkovil near Kalugumalai is one of the rarest exceptions to iconography of Harihara (Sankara-Narayana). The deity is depicted similar to the Ardhanari, the composite form of Shiva-Parvati, where <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the body is the male Shiva and left side is female. This image's female side represents Mohini and it, as a whole, symbolizes the union of Shiva and Mohini. The influence of Shakta traditions on Shaiva ones may have {{led to the development of}} composite images like Harihara, where Vishnu is identified with Shiva's consort, or Mohini. Like the Kanda Puranam narrative, the Shaiva saint Appar identifies Vishnu as Parvati (Uma), the female counterpart of Shiva.|$|E
