25|$|The affective {{reactivity}} model {{states that}} {{the strength of a}} person's reactions to affect-relevant events are caused by people's differences in affect. This model is based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory by Jeffrey Alan Gray, which states that people with stronger behavioral activation system (BAS) are high in reward responsiveness and are predisposed to the personality trait of extraversion, while people with a stronger behavioral inhibition system (BIS) are lower in reward responsiveness and are more predisposed to personality trait of neuroticism and introversion. Therefore, extraverts are seen as having a temperamental predisposition to positive affect since positive mood induction has a greater effect on them than on introverts, thus extraverts are more prone to react to pleasant effects. For example, Gable, Reis, and Elliot (2000). found in two consecutive studies that people with more sensitive BIS <b>reported</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of average negative affect, while people with more sensitive BAS <b>reported</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of positive affect. Also Zelenski and Larsen (1999) found that people with more sensitive BAS reported more positive emotions during the positive mood induction, while people with more sensitive BIS reported more negative emotions during the negative mood induction.|$|E

In a typical population, chromosomal damage affects 1% of people. Other studies were unable to find harm. The United States National Research Council (NRC) surveyed Love Canal health studies in 1991. The NRC noted the major exposure of concern was the groundwater rather than drinking water; the groundwater [...] "seeped into basements" [...] and then led to exposure through air and soil noted several studies <b>reported</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of low-birth weight babies and birth defects among the exposed residents with some evidence the effect subsided after the exposure was eliminated. The National Research Council also noted a study which found exposed children {{were found to have}} an [...] "excess of seizures, learning problems, hyperactivity, eye irritation, skin rashes, abdominal pain, and incontinence" [...] and stunted growth. Voles in the area were found to have significantly increased mortality compared to controls (mean life expectancy in exposed animals [...] "23.6 and 29.2 days, respectively, compared to 48.8 days" [...] for control animals).

The research targeting this group of individuals, however, is sparse and tempered by significant limitations. The current study aimed to address methodological limitations in the current literature by including instruments to formally diagnosis ADHD and comorbid disorders, utilizing psychometrically sound instruments and comparing functioning of college students with ADHD across gender and subtype. It was hypothesized that participants with ADHD would <b>report</b> lower GPAs, <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of emotional distress and negative relationship characteristics than participants without ADHD. It was also hypothesized that participants with ADHD-combined type (ADHD-C) would <b>report</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of substance and alcohol use than participants with ADHD-predominately inattentive type (ADHD-I), and that participants with ADHD-I would <b>report</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of anxiety and depression than participants with ADHD-C. Women diagnosed with ADHD were expected to <b>report</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of anxiety and depression than men diagnosed with ADHD; whereas, men diagnosed with ADHD were expected to <b>report</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of substance and alcohol use than women.

40|$|The present thesis {{provides}} a theoretical overview, including a neurobiological perspective, of well-being (WB), eudaimonic well-being (EWB), optimism, pessimism {{and cultural differences}} between Western and Eastern societies.  In addition, an empirical study investigated these concepts in Japanese and Swedish participants. Definitional problems and scarce neurobiological findings are two current problems to date within research on WB, EWB and cultural differences especially when looking at comparisons between Europe and East Asia. Interpretations and conclusions are therefore hard and tentative to make as more research is yet needed. This thesis empirical part therefore investigated the association between these concepts. In {{the best of the}} authors knowledge have this type of explorative study never been done before. 142 Swedish participants and 68 Japanese participants between the ages of 20 to 40 answered the self-reporting questionnaires; revised life orientation test (LOT-R), psychological well-being scale (SPWB) and the minimalist well-being scale (MWBS). The findings demonstrate that Swedish people <b>report</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of optimism compared with Japanese people whom in turn <b>report</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of pessimism when measured with LOT-R. Findings further demonstrate that Swedish people <b>report</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of EWB when measured with SPWB.
