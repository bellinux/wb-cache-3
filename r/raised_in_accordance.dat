Consequently, “our silence ...demonstrates that the point was immaterial.” Stevens added that it would be senseless for the constitutional protection of same words to be contingent on whether they are uttered as part of one’s job duties; additionally, it would be “perverse” for the Court to essentially create an incentive for employees to bypass their employer-specified channels of resolution and voice their concerns directly to the public.|$|E

50|$|The {{administration}} of Néstor Kirchner {{and of his}} wife and successor, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, had imposed price controls on utilities and public services, at levels cheaper than needed by service providers, since 2003. The state had provided subsidies to the service providers, compensating their losses. Fiscal austerity policies enacted early in 2012 removed many of these subsidies, however, leading to huge rate and fare increases. The removal of subsidies in the case of utility rates was done initially on a case-by-case basis, and by inviting people to voluntarily forfeit the subsidies by filling out a form; several politicians and other famous people did so. They were then removed for wealthy neighborhoods, and while rates were maintained in lower income districts, the increases were eventually extended to most people. Several unions requested wage <b>raises</b> <b>in</b> <b>accordance</b> to these increases and to high inflation generally; the rate and fare increases would cost up to 80% of the amount of the wage raises, however.|$|R

5000|$|The opening {{ceremony}} {{took place on}} September 6, 2008. The pre-ceremony performance was a succession of various musical performances, ranging from military music to folk music and a performance of Ode to Joy. Following a countdown, a fireworks display signalled {{the beginning of the}} ceremony proper. The national flag of China was then <b>raised,</b> <b>in</b> <b>accordance</b> with usual protocol, and the national anthem of China performed. [...] Performers wearing suits in bright colours paraded round the stadium, as a welcoming ceremony preceding the athletes' entry. As with the 2008 Summer Olympics, the ceremony included a parade of nations, with a flag bearer for each national team. Contrary to Olympic tradition, the national team of Greece did not enter first, as the Paralympic Games traces its roots to Stoke Mandeville rather than Olympia; the host country, as is customary in both Olympic and Paralympic Games, came last. As Chinese is written in characters and not letters, the order of the teams' entry was determined by the number of strokes in the first character of their respective countries' Simplified Chinese names. [...] Countries with the same number of strokes in the first character are sorted by those of the next character. This made Guinea (几内亚) the first country to enter as it takes two strokes to write the first character in the country's name (几). Following the athletes' parade, a performance took place, divided into chapters and sub-chapters entitled the [...] "Journey of Space" [...] and [...] "Journey of Life" [...] The sunbird performance entailed Yang Haitao (杨海涛), a singer with a visual impairment, singing about dreams while an acrobat in sunbird costume descended in simulated flight from the air and [...] "awakened the blind singer from his sleep".

5000|$|Marx regards money-wages and {{salaries}} {{as the price}} of labour power (though workers can also be paid [...] "in kind"), normally related to hours worked or output produced.

But wages can also be reduced through high price inflation and consumer taxes. Therefore, a distinction must always be drawn between nominal gross wages and real wages adjusted for tax and price inflation, and indirect tax imposts must be considered.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to verify the current anthropometrical status of the pupils of the age 12, as well as to compare it with the {{standards}} of <b>raising</b> <b>in</b> <b>accordance</b> with the WHO standards.

The anthropometric tests were done in height, weight, biacromial and elbow breadth, subcutaneous adipose tissue at the : suprailiac skinfold; subscapular skinfold; triceps skinfold, as well as the abdominal circumference. The results showed that there was a heterogenic distribution of results, especially in the body weight, where the distribution between the minimal and maximal results is 28 - 70 kg, with the average 43, 14 ± 9, 78 of standard deviation with the male pupils, while with the female pupils was noticed more homogenous group and the standard deviation was significantly lower than with the female pupils in all variables. The findings show that almost in all measured variables female pupils are more developed at this age, especially the body high, body weight and subcutaneous adipose tissue, while as regards the abdominal circumference and body breadth, the male pupils are more developed.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{judicial}} economy is well accepted in World Trade Organization (WTO) litigation, and {{it stands for}} the proposition that WTO panels {{do not need to}} rule on every single claim made by complaining parties, only on those required to settle the dispute in question. However, little has been discussed about the possibility of the Appellate Body's; exercising judicial economy itself. Article 17. 12 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) seems to prevent the existence of judicial economy at the appeal level by providing that 'the Appellate Body shall address each of the issues <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> <b>accordance</b> with paragraph 6 during appellate proceeding'. However, despite this understanding of the scope of Article 17. 12, held by some of the original members, the Appellate Body began freeing itself from a strict reading of this provision, and in its report in United States [...] Subsidies on Upland Cotton, without any these members on the bench, made a clear statement in this regard.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether the {{ordinary}} principle of the price discrimination, that is, that the price will be lower in the market with the greater demand elasticity will hold or not if we take the tax evasion by a monopolist into consideration. We have derived the results that the equality of the demand elasticities in the two markets doesn't necessarily imply the equality of prices in the two markets and that the price in the market with the greater demand elasticity will not necessarily be lower. In addition, we have obtained the following policy implications. Raising the penalty rate for the tax evasion will raise the ratio between the home market price and the foreign market price. Therefore, when the home market price is higher than the foreign market price, the policy of raising the penalty rate will further increase the price difference between the home market and the foreign market under the price discrimination. In order to implement the policy for the tax evasion without increasing the price difference, we will be required to implement the following two policies; raising the penalty rate and decreasing the tax rate. If the penalty rate in the foreign market is also <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> <b>accordance</b> with the raised penalty rate in the home market, it would be possible to implement the policy for the tax evasion without increasing the price difference even if the tax rate is given...|$|E
