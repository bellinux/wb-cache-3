5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge {{that they were not}} deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E

5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
