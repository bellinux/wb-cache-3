40|$|Abstract: Many fault {{detection}} techniques/algorithms for detecting faults in <b>rule</b> <b>bases</b> {{have appeared in}} the literature. These techniques assume that the <b>rule</b> <b>base</b> is static. This paper presents a new approach/algorithm for detecting faults in dynamic <b>rule</b> <b>bases,</b> where <b>rules</b> may be added/deleted in response to certain events happening in the system being controlled by the <b>rule</b> <b>base.</b> This is performed by maintaining a set of structures, where new rules can be added to the dynamic <b>rule</b> <b>base</b> without the need to rebuild the structures that represent the <b>rule</b> <b>base.</b> The approach makes use of spanning trees and disjoint sets to check a dynamic <b>rule</b> <b>base</b> for different kinds of faults. The algorithm devises a tree/forest of the underlying directed graph by treating the directed graph as an undirected graph, and then checks for various faults and properties. The algorithm devises a new <b>rule</b> <b>base</b> (which is a subset of the current <b>rule</b> <b>base)</b> that is equivalent, in terms of its reasoning capabilities, to the current <b>rule</b> <b>base,</b> with the properties that the new <b>rule</b> <b>base</b> is fault free.

25|$|Bubble {{decompression}} {{models are}} a <b>rule</b> <b>based</b> approach to calculating decompression {{based on the}} idea that microscopic bubble nuclei always exist in water and tissues that contain water and that by predicting and controlling the bubble growth, one can avoid decompression sickness. Most of the bubble models assume that bubbles will form during decompression, and that mixed phase gas elimination occurs, which is slower than dissolved phase elimination. Bubble models tend to have deeper first stops to get rid of more dissolved gas at a lower supersaturation to reduce the total bubble phase volume, and potentially reduce the time required at shallower depths to eliminate bubbles.|$|E

Negligently handling fire was of particular importance in these societies given capacity for destruction and relatively limited firefighting resources. Liability for common carrier, which arose around 1400, was also emphasized in the medieval period. Unintentional injuries were relatively infrequent in the medieval period. As transportation improved and carriages became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, however, collisions and carelessness became more prominent in court records.

25|$|Within each {{ventilatory}} pattern {{there are}} several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a “zone of comfort” (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all {{the parameters of the}} pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as fuzzy logic, <b>rule</b> <b>based</b> expert systems, and artificial neural networks.|$|E
