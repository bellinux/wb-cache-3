In his work he praised Tiberius and Sejanus, even defending the latter's high position in the government, despite not ranking higher than equestrian.

5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System. The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy <b>remains</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> question in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by}} the gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System. These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System.|$|E

25|$|Whether or not qualia or {{consciousness}} {{can play}} any causal {{role in the}} physical world <b>remains</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> question, with epiphenomenalism acknowledging the existence of qualia while denying it any causal power. The position has been criticized by a number of philosophers, if only because our own consciousness seem to be causally active. In order to avoid epiphenomenalism, one who believes that qualia are nonphysical would need to embrace something like interactionist dualism; or perhaps emergentism, the claim that there are as yet unknown causal relations between the mental and physical. This in turn would imply that qualia can be detected by an external agency through their causal powers.|$|E
25|$|Further, the {{political}} {{branches of government}} may seek to limit judicial review {{through the use of}} ouster clauses.

25|$|The {{rejection}} {{is not of}} Pliny's {{eyewitness account}} or of Pliny's date, as transmitted in the text read in modern times. The rejection focuses on manuscript variants looking for possible sources of copyist alteration of Pliny's date. In some ancient and medieval manuscripts of other authors, the month has been omitted. If some original had no month, then the copyists may have felt obliged to provide one, but chose wrongly. Rolandi et al. suggest an original date of a.d.

25|$|Another momentous {{process in}} Gowa and Talloq's early history was the {{introduction}} of writing {{in the form of}} the Makassar alphabet, knowledge of which was apparently widespread by 1605. However, the early history of the script remains shrouded in mystery. Although some historians have interpreted the Gowa Chronicle as stating that writing was unknown until the reign of Tumapaqrisiq Kallonna, it is generally thought that writing existed in the region some time prior to the sixteenth century. There is also universal agreement that the alphabet ultimately derives from an Indic source, although it <b>remains</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> question which Indic script had the greatest influence on the Makassar alphabet; the Javanese kawi script, the Batak and Rejang alphabets of Sumatra, and even the Gujarati script of western India have all been proposed.|$|E
25|$|To see why exotic {{matter is}} required, {{consider}} an incoming light front traveling along geodesics, which then crosses the wormhole and re-expands {{on the other}} side. The expansion goes from negative to positive. As the wormhole neck is of finite size, we would not expect caustics to develop, at least within {{the vicinity of the}} neck. According to the optical Raychaudhuri's theorem, this requires a violation of the averaged null energy condition. Quantum effects such as the Casimir effect cannot violate the averaged null energy condition in any neighborhood of space with zero curvature, but calculations in semiclassical gravity suggest that quantum effects may be able to violate this condition in curved spacetime. Although it was hoped recently that quantum effects could not violate an achronal version of the averaged null energy condition, violations have nevertheless been found, so it <b>remains</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> possibility that quantum effects might be used to support a wormhole.|$|E

Similarly, demand for further research on possible connections of individual and collective intelligence exists within plenty of other potentially transferable logics of individual intelligence, such as, for instance, the development over time or the question of improving intelligence. Whereas it is controversial whether human intelligence can be enhanced via training, a group's collective intelligence potentially offers simpler opportunities for improvement by exchanging team members or implementing structures and technologies. Moreover, social sensitivity was found to be, at least temporarily, improvable by reading literary fiction as well as watching drama movies.
