5|$|The {{rarefaction}} is <b>reflected</b> <b>off</b> {{the sloping}} end {{wall of the}} clarinet mouthpiece. The opening between the reed and the mouthpiece makes very little difference to {{the reflection of the}} rarefaction wave. This is because the opening is very small compared {{to the size of the}} tube, so almost the entire wave is reflected back down the tube even if the reed is completely open at the time the wave hits (image 3).|$|E
5|$|The shadowed {{portion of}} the crater was imaged with the Terrain Camera of the Japanese SELENE {{spacecraft}} using the illumination of sunlight <b>reflected</b> <b>off</b> the rim. The interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical 30° slope that leads down to a 6.6km diameter floor. The handful of craters along the interior span {{no more than a}} few hundred meters. The bottom is covered by an uneven mound-like feature that is 300 to 400m thick. The central peak is about 200m in height.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more than}} a few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is <b>reflected</b> <b>off</b> of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E

50|$|A pulse will <b>reflect</b> <b>off</b> a {{fixed end}} and return with the {{opposite}} direction of displacement. In this case, the pulse is said to have inverted. That is, a pulse with an upward displacement will <b>reflect</b> <b>off</b> the end and return with a downward displacement.|$|R
5|$|To {{determine}} winds aloft, rawinsondes determine {{wind speed}} by GPS, radio navigation, or radar tracking of the probe. Alternatively, {{movement of the}} parent weather balloon position can be tracked from the ground visually using theodolites. Remote sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or <b>reflected</b> <b>off</b> suspended aerosols or molecules, and radiometers and radars {{can be used to}} measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be used to estimate wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next. Wind engineering describes the study {{of the effects of the}} wind on the built environment, including buildings, bridges and other man-made objects.|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights work {{by using}} a lens or an image-forming curved mirror with a {{luminous}} or reflective overlay image or reticle at its focus, creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that reticle. The image is <b>reflected</b> <b>off</b> some form of angled beam splitter or the partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam splitter or mirror) will see the image at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity. Since the optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of collimated light, light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with, i.e. with no parallax at infinity. The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window. But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge. Eye movement perpendicular to the device's optical axis will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.|$|E

25|$|Depending on the {{aerodynamic}} {{design of}} the vehicle and various ambient atmospheric conditions, a train would begin to exhibit transonic airflow {{in the vicinity of}} Mach 0.8 (988km/h) and higher. From a modern perspective, this is essentially the realistic maximum speed of trains as they are known today. This is because the Prandtl-Glauert singularity would cause catastrophic damage to the vehicle as the sound waves <b>reflected</b> <b>off</b> of the ground, potentially blasting the train into the air. The only trains that could exceed this speed significantly are vactrains.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} as an undergraduate, David Collins worked at the Pennsylvania Railroad and {{became aware of the}} need to {{automatically}} identify railroad cars. Immediately after receiving his master's degree from MIT in 1959, he started work at GTE Sylvania and began addressing the problem. He developed a system called KarTrak using blue and red reflective stripes attached {{to the side of the}} cars, encoding a six-digit company identifier and a four-digit car number. Light <b>reflected</b> <b>off</b> the stripes was fed into one of two photomultipliers, filtered for blue or red.|$|E
25|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the eclipse, many {{counterfeit}} glasses were put up for sale. Effective eclipse glasses must not only block most visible light, but most UV and infrared light as well. For visible light, the user should only be able to see the Sun, sunglint <b>reflected</b> <b>off</b> shiny metal, halogen bulbs, the filament in unfrosted incandescent bulbs, and similarly intense sources. Determining whether the glasses effectively block enough UV and infrared light requires the use of spectrophotometer, which is a rather expensive piece of lab equipment.|$|E

25|$|When the {{amplification}} {{process is}} complete the laser light enters the experimental chamber, lying {{at one end}} of the building. Here it is <b>reflected</b> <b>off</b> a series of deformable mirrors that help correct remaining imperfections in the wavefront, and then feeds them into the target chamber from all angles. Since the overall distances from the ends of the beamlines to different points on the target chamber are different, delays are introduced on the individual paths to ensure they all reach the center of the chamber at the same time, within about 10picoseconds (ps). The target, a fusion fuel pellet about 1mm in diameter in the case of HiPER, lies at the center of the chamber.|$|E
25|$|During the 1910s {{and early}} 1920s {{a number of}} {{researchers}} discovered that shorter wavelength signals were <b>reflected</b> <b>off</b> what would later be known as the ionosphere. This allowed the signal to hop over very long distances by reflecting multiple times off the ground and ionosphere. This greatly extended range, allowing lower power transmitters to be used for very long-range communications. By 1923 a number of amateur radio operators (hams) demonstrated excellent performance at 100m and started routine trans-Atlantic communications the next year. This led to a number of new frequency bands being defined in this shortwave region, as short as 10m (which is very long by today's standards). By 1930 these frequencies were in widespread use for many purposes.|$|E
25|$|Over {{long time}} scales, climate is {{controlled}} by Milankovitch cycles changing the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth. The weakening and strengthening of the monsoon also plays an important role. Siroco et al. suggest that {{the strength of the}} monsoon in linked to the albedo in the Himalaya. Cooler temperatures in the northern hemisphere winter lead to more sunlight <b>reflected</b> <b>off</b> snow and ice and weaker summer monsoons, leading to a drier climate in East Africa. The strength of the monsoon is also linked to Milankovitch cycles with a lag of around 8,000 years. Generally the maximum monsoons occur 2,500 years after a glacial minimum. This maximum corresponds to a minimum of sea surface temperatures.|$|E

25|$|Type II Seyfert galaxies {{have the}} {{characteristic}} bright core, {{as well as}} appearing bright when viewed at infrared wavelengths. Their spectra contain narrow lines associated with forbidden transitions, and broad lines associated with allowed strong dipole or intercombination transitions. In some Typenbsp&II Seyfert galaxies, analysis with a technique called spectro-polarimetry (spectroscopy of polarised light component) revealed obscured typenbsp&I regions. In the case of NGC 1068, nuclear light <b>reflected</b> <b>off</b> a dust cloud was measured, which led scientists {{to believe in the}} presence of an obscuring dust torus around a bright continuum and broad emission line nucleus. When the galaxy is viewed from the side, the nucleus is indirectly observed through reflection by gas and dust above and below the torus. This reflection causes the polarisation.|$|E
25|$|Since 1963, Kusama has {{continued}} her series of Mirror/Infinity rooms. In these complex infinity mirror installations, purpose-built rooms lined with mirrored glass contain scores of neon-colored balls, hanging at various heights above the viewer. Standing inside {{on a small}} platform, an observer sees light repeatedly <b>reflected</b> <b>off</b> the mirrored surfaces {{to create the illusion}} of a never-ending space. During the following years, Kusama was enormously productive, and by 1966 she was experimenting with room-size, freestanding installations that incorporated mirrors, lights, and piped-in music. She counted Judd and Joseph Cornell among her friends and supporters. However, she did not profit financially from her work. Around this time, Kusama was hospitalized regularly from overwork, and O'Keeffe convinced her own dealer Edith Herbert to purchase several works in order to help Kusama stave off financial hardship.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS): The UVIS is a remote-sensing {{instrument}} that captures {{images of the}} ultraviolet light <b>reflected</b> <b>off</b> an object, such as the clouds of Saturn and/or its rings, {{to learn more about}} their structure and composition. Designed to measure ultraviolet light over wavelengths from 55.8 to 190nm, this instrument is also a tool to help determine the composition, distribution, aerosol particle content and temperatures of their atmospheres. Unlike other types of spectrometer, this sensitive instrument can take both spectral and spatial readings. It is particularly adept at determining the composition of gases. Spatial observations take a wide-by-narrow view, only one pixel tall and 64 pixels across. The spectral dimension is 1,024 pixels per spatial pixel. Also, it can take many images that create movies {{of the ways in which}} this material is moved around by other forces.|$|E
