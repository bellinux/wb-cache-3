40|$|This article {{looks at}} {{exchange}} rate risk and currency exposure. A company is exposed to {{exchange rate risk}} if the company’s value is affected by fluctuations {{in one or more}} exchange rates. The effect may be direct or indi-rect. The most obvious sources of direct impact are import and export prices. A Norwegian exporter selling in USD will immediately experience a fall in Norwegian income if the USD exchange rate depreciates, whereas a Norwegian importer buying in USD will register a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>costs.</b> These examples show the direct effect of a depreciation of the USD exchange rate on the bottom line. However, it is not only such direct effects that are relevant. Changes in the exchange rate can just as often have an effect through indirect chan-nels. For example, take a Norwegian cooker manufac...|$|R
40|$|The {{big company}} may spend {{millions}} of dollars of expenditure on indirect goods and services. However, much of them may be carried out locally or divisionally, bypassing central guidelines. From a corporate perspective the fragmented procurement resulted in slow and expensive processes and excessive product costs due to poor leverage of buying power. The greater information processing capability achieved through the use of technology, especially Internet-based procurement systems, will enable significant cost improvements and leverage to be obtained through a more strategic approach to management of the typically routine and repetitive tasks with a low unit value, high variety of goods and services, but relatively high frequency. According to the researches, a 10 percent <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>costs</b> can easily lead to a 50 percent rise in profit margin. This paper addresses the issue of how the Internet-based technologies will impact on the procurement strategy. I believe that the radical change in the Internet will give rise to new marketspaces, which may have the largest impact on procurement. The benefits to aware impacts come not only through direct cost savings but also through the improved efficiency of companies rethinking how they operate. 1...|$|R

This paper highlights the efforts taken by the management of a medium sized specialty chemicals plant in Baton Rouge, LA. This site spent over $ 5. 1 million in 2007 ($ 2. 1 million for natural gas & $ 3. 0 million for electricity). The site is generating steam for its process operation from the two gas fired boilers at 175 -psig pressure. The steam is consumed at three of its five process areas. The other two process areas are not significant steam users. Condensate recovery is about 55 %, while the system is designed to recover condensate from all steam users. Make-up water is supplied from a Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant. The optimization study was conducted at this site between Mar ? May 2008, to identify opportunities to reduce the energy cost and to improve the steam system?s reliability. The study identified nine energy cost optimization opportunities {{that would result in}} a total cost savings of $ 306, 000 annually. The initial estimates indicate that 7 of the 9 projects recommended by the study have simple payback periods of less than one year.

40|$|Optimization of Steam & Condensate {{systems in}} any continuous-process plant results <b>in</b> {{substantial}} <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>purchased</b> energy <b>cost.</b> During periods {{of natural gas}} price hikes, this would benefit the plant in controlling their fuel budget significantly. If planned well, the energy cost savings efforts could also give the spin-off benefit of waste water reduction from the plant. This paper highlights the efforts taken by the management of a medium sized petroleum refinery in Mid-West USA. This site has two sections of process units with tank farms located in between them. The refinery uses its own process off-gases and purchases additional natural gas to fire its Boilers and process heaters. Steam is also generated from the exhaust gases of the process heaters. An optimization study was conducted at this refinery site during Sep ? Nov 2006, to identify opportunities to reduce the energy cost, to improve the steam system?s reliability, and to reduce the waste water loading to the treatment plant. The study identified 8 energy and water use optimization opportunities {{that would result in}} a total cost savings of $ 2. 67 million annually. The initial estimates indicated that all the projects recommended by the study would have simple payback periods of less than 2 years. The plant management decided to pursue 3 of the 8 recommendations and completed Basic Engineering design during early 2007. The management is interested in pursuing the other identified energy savings opportunities also upon implementing the initial 3 projects. Upon implementing all the identified projects by the study, the refinery?s energy use is expected to reduce by 89, 900 MMBtu/yr & Water usage would reduce by 38, 900 kGals/yr. The reduction of hot condensate dumping to the waste water pond is also expected to save the bug-life in the waste water pond. This case study is a good example and motivation for all the engineers and managers, who are responsible for maintaining the efficiency and reliability of the steam systems in their plants...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the state-of-the-art and development prospects of using e-procurement for projects {{related to the}} engineering and contracting (E&C) sector in Italy through {{the results of a}} study carried out during 2001 - 2002 in collaboration with ANIMP (Italian Association of Industrial Plant Engineering). The companies included in the sample account for 75 % of the revenue generated in the sector, (valued at more than $ 17 billion). Given the globalized reference market and the internazionalization of the E&C companies, {{the results of the study}} also provide a sound description of the sector’s behavior worldwide. Although there are substantial differences between large and medium/small companies, it is evident that a strong information technology (IT) culture has developed at all corporate levels and integrated into working processes, albeit mainly with simpler applications (i. e., e-mail, Web-sites, etc). Furthermore, little attention is paid to codesign and coengineering systems, meaning that present e-procurement solutions are limited to the purchase of project materials and systems with low engineering content. The potential savings in adopting e-procurement solutions are estimated to be worth a 7 - 10 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> overall project <b>purchasing</b> <b>costs.</b> This represents at least the 60 % of the company annual revenue. Nevertheless, the study highlights ongoing and planned investments that are underfocused, pointing to unconsolidated e-business strategies. The advent of e-procurement is, therefore, likely to lead to profound restructuring of operational practice and the management of internal processes, generating challenges in company culture and personnel training...|$|R

Evidence acquisitionThis follow-up study conducted <b>in</b> 2013 used <b>purchase</b> data from 2000 to 2012 among U. S. households with children and compared trends <b>in</b> calorie <b>purchases</b> of HWCF, non-HWCF name brands, and private label (PL) products in the pre-pledge period (2000 – 2007) and the post-pledge period (2008 – 2012); controlled for potential effects of concurrent changes in demographic and economic factors, including the Great Recession and food prices; and assessed whether the HWCF marketplace pledge was associated with <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> consumer packaged goods (CPG) calorie purchases by households with children. Evidence synthesisThere {{has been a significant}} per capita decline in average daily CPG caloric purchases between 2000 and 2012 among households with children from all brand categories. Based on pre-pledge trends, declines <b>in</b> CPG caloric <b>purchases</b> were already occurring. However, post-pledge <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> calories <b>purchased</b> from HWCF brands were less than expected, and <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> calories <b>purchased</b> from non-HWCF name brands and PLs were greater than expected after economic, sociodemographic, and secular factors were accounted for. ConclusionsIf the 16 HWCF companies had been able to maintain their pre-pledge trajectory, there should have been an additional 42 kcal/capita/day <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> calories <b>purchased</b> from HWCF products in 2012 among households with children.

The impressive endeavours of the Court to understand and respond to a difficult economic reality represented a significant elevation of the status of wages policy in macroeconomic management – one that was to last for 60 years.

By 1740, Rhode Island bills of exchange were only four percent of face value and those of Massachusetts were eleven percent. The money supply was growing at a much faster rate than that of the overall colonial economy, which led to hyperinflation and the corresponding <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>purchasing</b> power per unit of money.
