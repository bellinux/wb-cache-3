5|$|On 23 December, Lieutenant-General Dempsey's XIII Corps {{launched}} a new attack to push back the German line from Orsogna. In the afternoon, the British 5th Infantry Division attacked on the <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corps front toward the Arielli stream. Their objective was to secure the flank of the 2nd New Zealand Division, which was in turn to attack northwest and west from the salient in order to roll up the Orsogna defences from the north.|$|E
5|$|On the <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republican party, some of Goldwater's {{political}} positions included anti-communism, {{an emphasis}} on total victory in war and opposition to high taxes and government spending. He often criticized the politics {{of some of his}} more moderate contemporaries, including President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He criticized some aspects of Eisenhower's economic policy, citing his failure to balance the federal budget. After being written off as too right-wing to successfully wage a presidential campaign, Goldwater actively supported Richard Nixon's campaign against John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|Baird co-chaired Jim Flaherty's second {{campaign}} {{to lead the}} Progressive Conservative party in 2004. Flaherty was again unsuccessful, losing on the second ballot to the more centrist John Tory. Baird and Flaherty left provincial politics in 2005 to campaign for the federal House of Commons. Although Baird was generally on the <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> provincial Progressive Conservative Party, he expressed liberal views on some social issues. He supported same-sex marriage during the 2003 provincial election, and in 2005 helped the McGuinty government achieve quick passage of a provincial bill granting legal recognition to same-sex couples.|$|E
5|$|During 19 September, the XXI Corps had {{destroyed}} the <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman front line, capturing 7,000 prisoners and 100 guns.

On 19 and 20 September the XXI Corps suffered total of 3,378 casualties of whom 446 were killed. They had captured 12,000 prisoners, 149 guns and vast quantities of ammunition and transport. With the exception of the Asia Corps, the whole Eighth Army had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 7 April, Trifunović again pressed Petrović to order a withdrawal from the border. Petrović accepted that this might become necessary if {{the situation on the}} immediate right flank of the 7th Army deteriorated further, but the idea was opposed by the Slovene {{chief of staff of the}} headquarters of the 1st Army Group, Armijski đeneral Leon Rupnik, who suggested that Trifunović, a Serb, should personally lead night attacks to push the Germans back. At 19:30, the Yugoslav Supreme Command advised Petrović that he had approval to withdraw endangered units on the <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 7th Army. Morale in the 7th Army had started to decline due to fifth column elements encouraging soldiers to stop resisting the enemy.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{buildings}} in the bathing complex. The northernmost building {{was used as the}} resting place and changing room for the daughters and concubines of the sultan. On the south side of this building is a pool known as Umbul Muncar. The pool is divided into two by a central pathway (known as Blumbang Kuras) that runs east-west. The next building on the south is a building with a tower in its center. The <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building was used as the sultan's changing room, the east wing was used as his resting place. The central tower was used by the sultan to observe his daughters and concubines bathing in the pool.|$|E
5|$|Burnside {{was given}} {{command of the}} <b>Right</b> <b>Wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Army of the Potomac (the I Corps and his own IX Corps) {{at the start of}} the Maryland Campaign for the Battle of South Mountain, but McClellan {{separated}} the two corps at the Battle of Antietam, placing them on opposite ends of the Union battle line and returning Burnside to command of just the IX Corps. Burnside implicitly refused to give up his authority, and acted as though the corps commander was first Maj. Gen. Jesse L. Reno (killed at South Mountain) and then Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox, funneling orders through them to the corps. This cumbersome arrangement contributed to his slowness in attacking and crossing what is now called Burnside's Bridge on the southern flank of the Union line.|$|E
5|$|Captain San Pedro {{detected}} {{the movements of}} the American troops from his positions on a nearby hill and ordered his men to open fire. Garretson then ordered a direct attack on the Spanish and Puerto Rican forces in the hacienda. At day break, the 6th Massachusetts overran the Spanish forces and suffered four casualties. Puig was expecting reinforcements from Yauco which did not arrive and was ordered to disengage and retreat. Before retreating the <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish force, which was not overrun, initiated a flanking attack against two positions held by the Illinois and Massachusetts companies. The unexpected strength of the Spanish force caused some of the 6th Massachusetts troops to momentarily panic, but the Spanish forces were eventually driven off. Puig and his forces suffered two officers and three soldiers wounded and two soldiers dead.|$|E

5|$|Douglas-Home {{accepted}} the foreign affairs portfolio in Heath's shadow cabinet. Many expected {{this to be}} a short-lived appointment, a prelude to Douglas-Home's retirement from politics. It came at a difficult time in British foreign relations: events in the self-governing colony of Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia), which had been drifting towards crisis for some years, finally erupted into open rebellion against British sovereignty. The predominantly white minority government there opposed an immediate transfer to black majority rule before the colony had achieved sovereign statehood, and in November 1965 it unilaterally declared independence. Douglas-Home won the approval of left-wing Labour MPs such as Wedgwood Benn for his unwavering opposition to the rebel government, and for ignoring those on the <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Conservative party who sympathised with the rebels on racial grounds.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Winston Field {{appointed}} Van der Byl as {{a junior}} government whip, and on 16 March 1964 he was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Justice with responsibility for the Information Service. Although the Van der Byl family were identified as strongly liberal in South African politics, he became identified with the <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party and helped to depose Field from the premiership in early April 1964, when Field failed to persuade the British government to grant Southern Rhodesia its independence. The new Prime Minister, Ian Smith, appointed him Deputy Minister for Information. At this time, Van der Byl's chief adviser was a South African called Ivor Benson, who also served as press censor. Benson believed that an international communist conspiracy was plotting to overthrow white rule in Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Bessell's efforts {{ensured that}} {{for the time being}} the Scott threat was kept at bay. The missing {{insurance}} card meant that Scott's wife, who was pregnant, could not claim maternity benefits. Scott threatened to talk to newspapers, but the matter was resolved by the issue of an emergency card after Bessell's intervention at the Department of Health and Social Security. In 1970 Scott's marriage collapsed; he blamed Thorpe, and again threatened exposure. Bessell successfully prevented Thorpe's name being mentioned in court during the divorce proceedings, and arranged that Thorpe would anonymously pay the legal costs. Early in 1971 Scott moved to a cottage in the village of Talybont in North Wales, where he befriended a widow, Gwen Parry-Jones. He sufficiently persuaded her of his mistreatment at the hands of Thorpe that she contacted the Liberal MP for the adjoining constituency of Montgomeryshire—Emlyn Hooson, on the <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party and a friend of neither Thorpe nor Bessell. Hooson suggested a meeting at the House of Commons.|$|E

5|$|Mitchell {{proved to}} be an {{energetic}} and effective constituency member. He also served for a year as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Scotland. However, it became apparent that he was not likely to progress as a minister. His main political interest was the British Army and he was frequently critical of the Army’s leadership. For example, in August 1970 he was quoted as having referred to ”… those bastards in Whitehall”. He gravitated towards the <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Conservative party. He opposed British membership of the European Community, Rhodesian sanctions, and the arms embargo on Israel. He became a prominent member of both the Monday Club and the Anglo-Rhodesian Society. Mitchell became known as a maverick MP and was one of 39 Conservative rebels who defied the Party whip to vote against British entry to the EEC in the Commons vote on 28 October 1971.|$|E
5|$|Muhanna later {{commanded}} the <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mamluk army during the Third Battle of Homs in 1299/1300, {{during which the}} Mamluks were defeated by the Mongol Ilkhanids. In 1311, the Mamluk na'ib (governor) of Aleppo, Qarasunqur, defected to the Ilkhanids and was given refuge by Muhanna, who unsuccessfully attempted to mediate between Qarasunqur and Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1310–1341). These circumstances together with Muhanna's suspicions of an-Nasir's negative disposition toward him prompted Muhanna and Qarasunqur to seek safe haven in Ilkhanid-held Iraq. To that end, in 1312, Muhanna sent his son Musa to confer with Öljaitü of the Ilkhanate, and afterward he defected to the latter with his son Sulayman; unlike his father, Musa remained loyal to the Mamluks. Öljaitü gave Muhanna iqtaʿat (fiefs) in al-Hillah, south of Baghdad. An-Nasir Muhammad consequently dismissed Muhanna from his principality and appointed his brother Fadl ibn Isa the lord of Palmyra.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March 1918, the German Army had {{launched}} Operation Michael, {{the first in}} a series of attacks planned to drive the Allies back along the length of the Western Front. With the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with revolutionary-controlled Russia, the Germans were able to transfer hundreds of thousands of men to the Western Front, giving them a significant, if temporary, advantage in manpower and materiel. These offensives were intended to translate this advantage into victory. Operation Michael was intended to defeat the <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Expeditionary Force (BEF), but a lack of success before Arras ensured the ultimate failure of the offensive. A final effort was aimed at the town of Amiens, a vital railway junction, but the advance had been halted at Villers-Bretonneux by British and Australian troops on 4 April.|$|E

5|$|The Earl of Oxford, {{commanding}} the <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Neville army, broke the opposing Yorkist line, under William, Lord Hastings, {{early in the}} battle. Oxford's men proceeded to chase the fleeing soldiers, and ended up looting away from the battlefield. Oxford managed to regroup his men, but, returning to the battlefield, as James Ross has put it, 'disaster struck.' In the time he and his force had been absent, the line of battle had shifted almost ninety degrees, so instead of returning to attack Edward's rear, he crashed into Montagu's section. The fog prevented identification, and Oxford's men fought with Montagu's. Montagu may, one chronicler suggests, have mistakenly seen Oxford's 'Streaming star' banner as the king's 'Sunne in splendour,' and thus believe that the Earl had gone over to York. Recently though, one historian has pointed out that, in fact, Oxford had never previously used such a cognizance, and it was more prosaically just a case of men confused by fog.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav Supreme Command ordered Petrović to use Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski {{to capture}} Fiume, across the Rječina river from Sušak, but {{the order was}} soon {{rescinded}} due to the deteriorating situation in the flanking 4th Army.

5|$|The allied Greek {{army had}} taken up a {{position}} near Chaeronea, astride the main road. On the left flank, the allied Greek line lay across the foothills of Mount Thurion, blocking the side-road that led to Lebedea, while on the right, the line rested against the Kephisos river, near a projecting spur of Mount Aktion. The allied Greek army included contingents from Achaea, Corinth, Chalcis, Epidaurus, Megara and Troezen, {{with the majority of}} troops being supplied by Athens and Thebes, thus making it an army of allied cities of southern Greece, that had been traditionally self-governed for centuries. The Athenian contingent was led by the generals Chares and Lysicles, and the Thebans by Theagenes. No source provides exact numbers for the allied Greek army; the modern view is that the allied Greek numbers were approximately equal to those of the Macedonians, who according to Diodorus numbered roughly 30,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. Philip took command of the <b>right</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Macedonian wing and placed his 18-year-old son Alexander (the future Alexander the Great) in command of the left wing, accompanied by a group of Philip's experienced generals.|$|E
