50|$|Key to the {{production}} of chlorine is the operation of the brine saturation/treatment system. Maintaining a properly saturated solution with the correct purity is vital, especially for membrane cells. Many plants have a salt pile which is sprayed with recycled brine. Others have slurry tanks that are fed raw salt and recycled brine. The <b>raw</b> <b>brine</b> is treated with sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide to precipitate calcium and magnesium. The reactions are often carried out in a series of reactors before the treated brine is sent to a large clarifier where the calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide are settled out. A floculating agent may be added just prior to the clarifier to improve settling. The decanted brine is then mechanically filtered using sand filters or leaf filters before entering a series of ion exchangers to further remove impurities. At several points in this process the brine is tested for hardness and strength.|$|E
40|$|Considered herein is {{a process}} concept that {{integrates}} fly ash amendment of brine produced {{as a result of}} oil and gas extraction with subsequent sequestration of carbon dioxide in the resulting alkaline solution. The CO 2 solubility-trapping capacity of the alkaline mixture is substantially greater than that of the acidic <b>raw</b> <b>brine.</b> In addition to pH adjustment, addition of CaO-rich combustion byproduct augments the concentration of Ca++ cations initially present in the brine to increase solution capacity for mineral trapping of CO 2. One- and two-stage approaches for implementation of this treatment process were considered. Batch reactions were conducted with several Class C fly ashes and one flue gas desulfurization (FGD) byproduct. Preliminary results verify the potential to substantially enhance CO 2 sequestration capacity and increase mineral sequestration of absorbed CO 2, primarily as CaCO 3. Feasibility of the described CO 2 sequestration treatment concept was, therefore, successfully demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The {{occurrence}} of Lake Katwe salt deposit in Western Uganda is well-known through the East African region. Production of salt from this saline lake has been practiced for decades following traditional methods; however {{the quality and}} yield of the products are p oor. There are also risks of burns, as the workers get into {{direct contact with the}} brine. Detail assessment and evaluation of the mine has been done through field studies, raw sample materials analysis. Results indicate that the <b>raw</b> <b>brine</b> from the lake is rich in sodium, chloride, potassium, carbonat es, sulphate ions with traces of calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonate ions. This motivates the aspiration to properly extract salts from such a rich source. The lake brines contain impurities such as organic matter and suspended solids. With increasing demand for usage of sustainable technologies for salt extraction, the present study calls for the improvement of salt extraction at Lake Katwe through optimizing the use of the current solar evaporation technique while integrating it with a mechanized chemical separation process. This would ensure better recovery and process efficiencies, low costs and simple brine pre-treatment procedures...|$|E
40|$|Nanofiltration {{membrane}} elements {{have been}} employed {{for the treatment}} of solutions containing <b>raw</b> <b>brine</b> generated by chloralkali industry. This study focused on the selection of appropriate nanofiltration membrane element and the assessment of their performance for the removal of sulfate and the retention of chloride from feed solutions. The influence of membrane type, temperature, pressure and sodium sulfate concentration on the selective removal of sulfate from concentrated sodium chloride brines were investigated. A high passage of sodium chloride and rejection of sodium sulfate were achieved with two different commercial nanofiltration membrane elements, DL 2540 produced by GE Osmonics and NF 270 - 2540 manufactured by FilmTec (Dow), suggesting that both membranes can be employed in sulfate removal from sodium chloride brines for chloralkali industry. Operating pressure and temperature showed no significant effects on sulfate rejection under the tested conditions. However permeate flux increased with both temperature and pressure in the tested ranges. The influence of temperature on permeate flux was due to the dependency of the viscosity of salt solution, which follows the Arrhenius model. Sodium concentration in feed had significant effects on permeate flux, sulfate rejection, and sulfate concentration at membrane interface and in permeate. Sulfate rejection and permeate flux reduced sharply with the increase of sulfate concentration in feed...|$|E

40|$|In {{vacuum salt}} {{production}} sulfate {{is an important}} impurity, {{but it is also}} used to remove other cationic impurities from the <b>raw</b> <b>brine.</b> Removal of excess sulfate is currently done by purging salt crystallizer mother liquor from the brine plant, or crystallizing sodium sulfate through evaporative or cooling crystallization. The use of nanofiltration for the production of brines supersaturated in sodium sulfate is a technically feasible and attractive alternative. Crystallization of sodium sulfate in the membrane modules can be avoided by the presence of a primary nucleation inhibitor in the feed to the nanofiltration unit. Sodium sulfate crystallization can be induced in a separate crystallizer outside of the membrane unit by addition of crystal seeds. NF 270 is a suitable membrane for this application and is preferred over Desal DK, Desal DL, TS- 80 and MPF- 34. Chloride and bromide retentions are negative and they are a function of the difference in sulfate concentration between concentrate and permeate. Carbonate retentions are linearly dependent on sulfate retentions. Calcium retention for NF 270 is in excess of 95 % and proven to be stable during 1200 h of continuous on-site pilot plant operation.

40|$|An {{environmentally}} friendly membrane distillation crystallization (MDC) system is proposed to treat high salinity reverse osmosis (RO) brine with zero discharge. The <b>raw</b> <b>brine</b> from RO desalination plants {{is concentrated in}} direct contact MD to produce pure water, and the concentrate is then crystallized to produce solid salts without secondary disposal. A comprehensive analysis on the MDC system has been performed by Aspen flowsheet simulation with a user customized MD model, which was verified by our previous experiments. Simulation results reveal that the total energy consumption is negligibly changed by integration of a crystallization unit into the system, as over 97. 8 % of the energy was consumed by the heater of the MD subsystem. Higher inlet temperatures of both the feed and permeate streams in the MD module can improve the thermal efficiency. The introduction of a heat recovery unit in the MDC system, to recover the heat in the permeate for feed preheating, can increase the gain output ratio (GOR) by 28 %. Moreover, it is shown that in a hollow fiber MD module, the permeate yield is a linear function of the length-to-radius ratio of the membrane module, and a longer MD module can reduce the specific energy consumption. A relatively high feed flow rate is preferred to avoid the potential problem of crystal blockage in the MD module...|$|E

A statistical approach was undertaken to optimize the % CaCO 3 formed from FA/brine/CO 2 interaction with input parameters of temperature, pressure, particle size and solid/liquid ratio (S/L) being varied. The ranges adopted for the input parameters were: temperature of 30 ºC or 90 ºC; pressure of 1 Mpa or 4 Mpa; four particle sizes namely bulk ash, > 150 μm, < 20 μm and 20 μm- 150 μm particle size range; S/L ratios of 0. 1, 0. 5 or 1. The FA/ brine dispersions were carbonated in a high pressure reactor varying the above mentioned input parameters. The fresh Secunda FA of various size fractions was characterized morphologically using scanning electron microscopy, chemically using X-ray fluorescence and mineralogically using qualitative X-ray diffraction.

These have proved to be hazardous and unsustainable to the salt miners and the environment. In this work, literature concerning the occurrence of salt and the most common available technologies for salt extraction is documented.

The mineral salt <b>raw</b> materials (<b>brines</b> and evaporites) were characterized to determine their physical, chemical, mineralogical, and morphological composition through field and laboratory analyses. In addition, laboratory extraction techniques were undertaken to evaluate possibilities of future sustainable salt extraction from the lake deposit. Also, PHREEQC simulations using Pitzer models were carried out to determine the present saturation state of the lake brine and to estimate which salts and the order in which they precipitate from the brine upon concentration by evaporation. Results reveal that the raw materials from the salt lake contain substantial amounts of salt which can be commercialized for optimum production. The brines are highly alkaline and rich in Na+, K+, Cl-, SO 42 -, CO 32 -, and HCO 3 -. Moreover, they contain trace amounts of Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Br-, and F-. The lake is hydro-chemically of a carbonate type with the brines showing an intermediate transition between Na-Cl and Na-HCO 3 water types. The evaporites are composed of halite mixed with other salts such as hanksite, burkeite, trona etc, with their composition varying considerably within the same grades. The laboratory extraction experiments indicate that various types of economic salts such as thenardite, anhydrite, mirabilite, burkeite, hanksite, gypsum, trona, halite, nahcolite, soda ash, and thermonatrite precipitate from the brine of Lake Katwe. The salts crystallize in the order following the sequence starting with sulfates, followed by chlorides and carbonates, respectively. Moreover, thermodynamic modeling in PHREEQC accurately predicted the solubility and sequence of the salt precipitation from the lake brine. Understanding the sequence of salt precipitation from the brine helps to control its evolution during concentration and hence, will lead to an improved operating design scheme of the current extraction processes.

The {{most common}} method of {{preserving}} <b>raw</b> hides is <b>brine</b> curing with sodium chloride. However, {{this process has}} three important disadvantages: first, {{the length of time}} that it takes, which is a minimum of 18 hourssecond, the insufficient degree of curing reached in some hides due to an overload and possibly the low efficiency of the brine racewayand finally, the environmental impact associated with the discharge of large quantities of electrolytes in the soaking step. Our long term goal is to address all three issues. Initially, we have carried out a study of the salt uptake and its diffusion mechanism in order to attempt a reduction in the curing time. A continuous reaction mathematical model of a closed one dimensional system that describes the diffusion of sodium chloride in the hide during the curing process was chosen in the search for the optimum brine curing conditions such as the optimum brine concentration and percent float. The effect of these two parameters on the values of effective diffusivity coefficients was reported. Moreover, the dependency of these coefficients with time was examined, showing an initial fast uptake zone followed by a slow and quite flat uptake zone. Brine diffusion into the hide was tracked by measurement of the electrolytic conductivity of the residual brine solution and moisture and ash content of the cured hide.

40|$|Uganda is well {{endowed with}} {{economic}} quantities of mineral salts {{present in the}} interstitial brines and evaporite deposits of Lake Katwe, a closed (endorheic) saline lake located in the western branch of the great East African rift valley. Currently, rudimentally and artisanal methods continue {{to be used for}} salt extraction from the lake raw materials. These have proved to be risky and unsustainable to the salt miners and the environment and they have a low productivity and poor product quality. This work involves the investigation of the salt raw materials that naturally occur in the brines and evaporites of Lake Katwe. The purpose is to propose strategies for the extraction of improved salt products for the domestic and commercial industry in Uganda. The literature concerning the occurrence of salt and the most common available technologies for salt extraction was documented. Also, field investigations were undertaken to characterize the salt lake deposits and to assess the salt processing methods and practices. The mineral salt <b>raw</b> materials (<b>brines</b> and evaporites) were characterized to assess their quality in terms of the physical, chemical, mineralogical, and morphological composition through field and laboratory analyses. An evaluation of the potential of future sustainable salt extraction from the lake deposits was done through field, experimental, and modeling methods. Moreover, the mineral solubilities in the lake brine systems and dissolution kinetics aspects were investigated. The results reveal that the salt lake raw materials contain substantial amounts of salt, which can be commercialized to enable an optimum production. The brines are highly alkaline and rich in Na+, K+, Cl-, SO 42 -, CO 32 -, and HCO 3 -. Moreover, they contain trace amounts of Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Br-, and F-. The lake is hydro-chemically of a carbonate type with the brines showing an intermediate transition between Na-Cl and Na-HCO 3 water types. Also, the evaporation-crystallization is the main mechanism controlling the lake brine chemistry. These evaporites are composed of halite mixed with other salts such as hanksite, burkeite, trona etc, but with a composition that varies considerably within the same grades. The laboratory isothermal extraction experiments indicate that various types of economic salts such as thenardite, anhydrite, mirabilite, burkeite, hanksite, gypsum, trona, halite, nahcolite, soda ash, and thermonatrite exist in the brine of Lake Katwe. In addition, the salts were found to crystallize in the following the sequence: sulfates, chlorides, and carbonates. A combination of results from the Pitzer’s ion-interaction model in PHREEQC and experimental data provided a valuable insight into the thermodynamic conditions of the brine and the sequence of salt precipitation during an isothermal evaporation. A good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results of the mineral solubilities in the lake brine systems was observed with an average deviation ranging between 8 - 28 %. The understanding of the mineral solubility and sequence of salt precipitation from the brine helps to control its evolution during concentration. Hence, it will lead to an improved operating design scheme of the current extraction processes. The dissolution rate of the salt raw materials was found to increase with an increased temperature, agitation speed and to decrease with an increased particle size and solid-to-liquid ratio. Moreover, the Avrami model provided the best agreement with the obtained experimental data (R 2 = 0. 9127 - 0. 9731). In addition, the dissolution process was found to be controlled by a diffusion mechanism, with an activation energy of 33. 3 kJ/mol. Under natural field conditions, the evaporative-crystallization process at Lake Katwe is influenced by in-situ weather conditions. Especially, the depth of the brine layer in the salt pans and the temperature play a significant role on the brine evaporation rates. With the optimal use of solar energy, it was established that the brine evaporation flux can be speeded up in the salt pans, which could increase the production rates. Moreover, recrystallization can be a viable technique to improve the salt product purity. Overall, it is believed that the current work provides useful information on how to exploit the mineral salts from the salt lake resources in the future.   QC 20151217 </p...|$|R
