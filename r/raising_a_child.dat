5|$|Some experts {{argue that}} exposing {{children}} to television {{at such an}} early age is taking technology too far or that parents are using BabyFirst as a digital babysitter.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against exposing {{children under the age of}} two to television, while a 2003 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most children under two years of age are already watching TV.

25|$|Mia visits Peyton, and Peyton is {{concerned}} that Mia is not focused on her work. She suggests to Mia that she listen to a CD of songs she could possibly sing. They clash because Mia writes all of her own songs. Eventually, Peyton gives up on Mia and asks her to leave the label. Meanwhile, Peyton deals with stomach pains. She sees a doctor about it, and tells the doctor about Ellie's cancer. Her tearful face after the phone call predicts trouble ahead.

Lucas surprises her by coming, and the two get to hear their baby's heartbeat for the first time.

500|$|After {{two years}} of discussions, Vikram began a film under the {{direction}} of Selvaraghavan in a project dubbed by the media as Sindubad. The film began shoot and completed a schedule by early 2010 in the Himalayas with Swati Reddy appearing as the female lead. However, the film was reported to be momentarily shelved and subsequently never took off again after the producer Singanamala Ramesh walked out. Vikram then agreed terms to feature in Vikram Kumar's 24 produced by Mohan Natarajan, with Ileana D'Cruz signed on to play the female lead role. The film progressed briefly with shots being canned in caves, before the director was ousted from the project, cancelling the film. Vikram then also shot briefly for a third successive shelved project directed by Boopathy Pandian for the same producer, featuring him in the role of an investigative cop; however the film failed to progress and instead Natarajan financed Vikram's next. His 2011 release, Deiva Thirumagal directed by A. L. Vijay, saw Vikram portray a father with a developmental disability having the mental maturity of a seven-year-old. To prepare for the role, Vikram visited homes for the mentally challenged such as Vidya Sagar and Vidya Sudha for a month, watching their body language and taking notes. He also communicated with the patients, to pick up the nuances of people with impaired speech. Vikram has since gone on to describe his role as Krishna as the best character he has ever portrayed. The film which also featured Sara Arjun, Anushka Shetty and Amala Paul in supporting roles, opened to predominantly positive reviews from critics and enjoyed commercial success at the box office. The reviewer from The Deccan Chronicle described that the film was [...] "Vikram's show all the way" [...] and that [...] "his rendition of a mentally-challenged man trying to cope with the everyday realities of <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> is a work of art", praising his [...] "fiery, complex performance as one of the more viciously honest depictions of mental illness cinema has seen". Similarly another critic described that the on-screen chemistry between Vikram and his daughter, played by Sara Arjun, is [...] "magic" [...] and their performances [...] "are sure to leave a lump in your throat". The critic from The Hindu praised the film and Vikram's performance but analysed that [...] "a problem arises only when you stop looking at Krishna as a character, and begin to see him as Vikram, the hero" [...] and that Vikram should have [...] "underplayed a little here and there and it would have worked better". However Vikram once again completed a sweep of the top acting awards that year, with further recognition at the Vijay and Filmfare Awards.|$|E

2500|$|In pre-industrial society, {{death rates}} and birth rates were both high, and fluctuated rapidly {{according}} to natural events, such as drought and disease, {{to produce a}} relatively constant and young population. Family planning and contraception were virtually nonexistent; therefore, birth rates were essentially only limited by the ability of women to bear children. Emigration depressed death rates in some special cases (for example, Europe and particularly the Eastern United States during the 19th century), but, overall, death rates tended to match birth rates, often exceeding 40 per 1000 per year. Children contributed to {{the economy of the}} household from an early age by carrying water, firewood, and messages, caring for younger siblings, sweeping, washing dishes, [...] preparing food, and working in the fields. <b>Raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> cost little more than feeding him or her; there were no education or entertainment expenses.
