During the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1878, more than 5000 people were listed in the official <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> between July 26 and November 27. The vast majority died of yellow fever, making the epidemic {{in the city of}} 40,000 people one of the most traumatic and severe in urban United States' history. Within four days of the Memphis Board of Health's declaration of a yellow fever outbreak, 20,000 residents had fled the city. The panic ensuing left the poverty-stricken, the working classes, and the African-American community at most risk from the epidemic. [...] Those who remained in Memphis relied on volunteers from religious and physician organizations to tend to the sick. By the end of the year, more than 5,000 were confirmed dead in Memphis. The New Orleans health board listed [...] "not less than 4,600" [...] dead. The Mississippi Valley recorded 120,000 cases of yellow fever, with 20,000 deaths. The $15 million in losses caused by the epidemic bankrupted the city of Memphis, and as a result its charter was revoked by the state legislature.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground: The {{homeless}} {{population of}} France {{has increased by}} 50 % over the last 10 years. Studies have shown that homelessness {{is associated with a}} high risk <b>of</b> premature <b>death.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this study was to estimate the number <b>of</b> homeless <b>deaths</b> in France between 2008 and 2010, using a reproducible method. Methods: We used the capture-recapture method to estimate the number <b>of</b> homeless <b>deaths</b> in France using two independent sources. An associative <b>register</b> <b>of</b> homeless <b>deaths</b> was matched with the national exhaustive database of the medical causes <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> using several matching approaches based on various combinations of the following variables: gender, age, place <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> date <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> Results: The estimated number <b>of</b> homeless <b>deaths</b> between 2008 and 2010 was 6730 (95 % CI: [4381 – 9079]), a number greatly underestimated by the two sources considered separately (less than 20 %). Conclusions: In the absence <b>of</b> a <b>register</b> <b>of</b> the homeless <b>deaths,</b> the capture-recapture method provides an order of magnitude for evaluation of the resources that may be allocated by policy makers to manage the issue. Based on common and routinely produced databases, this estimate may therefore be used to monitor the mortality of the homeless population. Further studies about homeless mortality, particularly on the lead causes <b>of</b> <b>deaths,</b> are needed to manage this issue and to implement strategy to decrease the number <b>of</b> homeless <b>deaths...</b>|$|R
