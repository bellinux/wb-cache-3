5000|$|The book {{is divided}} into four parts: [...] "The Modern World", [...] "Resources", [...] "The Third World", and [...] "Organization and Ownership". Part I {{summarizes}} the Economic world of the early 1970s, from Schumacher's perspective. In the first chapter, [...] "The Problem of Production", Schumacher argues that the modern economy is unsustainable. Natural resources (like fossil fuels), are treated as expendable income, {{when in fact they}} should be treated as capital, since they are not renewable, and thus subject to eventual depletion. He further argues that nature's <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>pollution</b> is limited as well. He concludes that government effort must be concentrated on sustainable development, because relatively minor improvements, for example, technology transfer to Third World countries, will not solve the underlying problem of an unsustainable economy. Schumacher's philosophy is one of [...] "enoughness", appreciating both human needs and limitations, and appropriate use of technology. It grew out of his study of village-based economics, which he later termed Buddhist economics, which is the subject of the book's fourth chapter.|$|E

The writers have identified fractal threshold values that describe the extent of environmental stability of a water system, its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> industrial <b>pollution,</b> and probability of further anthropogenic loads.

30|$|The {{electrostatic}} attraction between anionic groups and cationic groups was {{enhanced by the}} addition of cations to the molecular chain of partially hydrolyzed sodium polyacrylonitrile, which in turn further enhances the {{electrostatic attraction}} between filtration reducer cationic groups and clay particle anionic groups. Therefore, a network structure was formed to a certain extent, and could improve the polymer’s <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> salt <b>pollution</b> and its ability to confine free water. The filtration-reducing effect significantly improved (Wang and Zhang 1995). But when the cationic degree is too big, with the enhancement of the inhibitory effect of cationic quaternary ammonium, flocculation capacity is too strong, the solid particles in the system become excessively big, the number of colloidal microparticles reduces, the density of filter cake becomes small, so the permeability increases, resulting in greater filtration.|$|R
40|$|The phylum-level {{meta-analysis}} {{approach has}} been proposed {{as a way of}} comparing geographically different areas along a common scale of disturbance. However, the training data set which establishes the scale of disturbance and all subsequent studies using the approach have been exposed to some sort of organic or inorganic pollution. Using macrobenthic communities subjected to a short-lived but intense physical disturbance from offshore mining off the west coast of Southern Africa, we tested the applicability of the meta-analysis approach for assessing the severity of disturbance in physically disturbed communities. The positioning of the original data set along a primary axis of disturbance was maintained; however, a second significant separation, along the vertical axis, distinguishes between macrobenthic assemblages from southern Africa and the NE Atlantic Shelf. The southern African samples are characterised by a larger proportion of Crustacea, {{and in the case of}} mined samples Mollusca, whereas the NE Atlantic data contain relatively more Echinodermata in the unpolluted samples and are dominated by Annelida in the organically enriched areas. The proportion of annelids decreased by about 50 % in mined areas compared to the non-mined areas and the NE Atlantic samples. Conversely, bivalves and gastropods exhibited a notable increase in proportion in the mined patches compared to the adjacent non-mined areas, possibly as a result of their preferential ability to survive the mining process or their better ability to recolonise after mining, or an interplay of both factors. The mining activity may result in the selection of species for their physical robustness and tolerance to mining rather than their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>pollution</b> in the conventional sense. The failure of the meta-analysis to ordinate the mined samples along the primary horizontal axis of disturbance, as defined by Warwick & Clarke¹s original study (Mar Ecol Prog Ser 92 : 221 - 231), does not reflect a failure of the meta-analysis to detect disturbance, but rather shows that the primary axis is strongly determined by the opportunistic species characteristic of organically enriched areas. It appears that phylum-level meta-analysis is better suited to assessing the impact of organic and chemical pollution on an ocean-basin scale than it is to physical disturbance caused by offshore mining...|$|E

The arcing experiment was done with incline plane test in accordance with IEC 587. AC voltage in the range from 5 kV to 50 kV with frequency of 50 Hz was applied. The LC waveforms up to flash over were measured. The magnitudes as well as harmonic content of the LC were analyzed. The correlation between LC waveforms and dry band arching phenomenon was elaborated. Visual observation of the arc on the sample surfaces was observed using a video camera. Experimental results indicated that LC magnitude on clean samples was slightly affected by humidity (RH). However, under salt fog, RH greatly affected the LC magnitude. The flashover voltage of clean samples under salt fog reduced significantly for fog conductivity of more than 1. 2 mS/cm. Kaolin-polluted samples under salt fog showed an Ohmic behaviour. The LC magnitude was high and a large discrepancy of LC magnitude was observed for high applied voltage of larger than 25 kV. The largest LC magnitude was observed on salt-kaolin polluted samples under clean fog at high RH. LC waveforms analysis indicated that in general LC waveforms were distorted from sinusoidal. For clean samples under clean fog, THD of LC decreased with RH but slightly increased with the applied voltage. Large distortion at the peak of LC waveform was observed on kaolin polluted sample under salt fog of 3. 6 mS/cm and high RH and high applied voltage. This correlates with corona arc on the sample surface. Similar behaviour was observed on kaolin-salt polluted samples under clean fog. Tracking arc experiment indicated that arc length LC magnitude and arc intensity increased with the pollutant conductivity. The THD also significantly increased with pollutant conductivity. At conductivity of less than 0. 6 mS/cm the unsymmetrical LC waveforms were obtained. However, symmetrical LC waveforms were observed for conductivity of 0. 9 and 1. 2 mS/cm. The change of LC magnitude and waveform at different condition of samples may be useful for the diagnostics of insulator condition...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{work was}} the final step in the Samhällsbyggnadsprogrammet 120 hp at LTU. It was {{produced}} {{as part of the}} Environmental Management course for the Department of Technical Supply in Kalix Municipality, Norrbotten. Aim of the thesis is to examine the risks of pollution from private sewages which unfortunately often provide inadequate filtering of waste water, compared to municipal water and wastewater systems. The area in question lies in Rörbäck, northeast of Luleå. Kalix municipality is the responsible authority of drinking water in the area, but Luleå municipality owns the land not covered by the water pit and groundwater well area. Stricter rules of the EU Water Framework Directive have created a need to develop procedures for maintaining secure water quality and eliminate potential risks associated with water contamination. Previous to this work, a survey has been sent to property owners to inquire about their individual sewage systems in order to gain an understanding of the present situation. This thesis consists essentially of two parts. The first discusses and analyzes the probability of infiltration in the soil in the area based on topographic, geological and geo-hydrological information, and the second is an analysis of general contaminant risks. Also an estimate of the well area boundaries is provided, calculated according to standards set by the Protection Agency as stated in the agency manuals (2003 : 6). Topographical maps with elevation lines have been used to determine the slope and likely catchment area of aquifers, based on the variation in the terrain in the ground and its gradient. Geological soil maps, together with geo-hydrological map information, were used to assess the probable extent of soil infiltration and location of the topography. The second part consists of a general risk analysis, which includes activities in the Rörbäck area and associated risk sources. The risk analysis examines the individual sewage treatment placements and their potential impact of pollution on the groundwater. The analysis showed that placements with timber-cutting gave a high score in the risk analysis, because the level of protective soil layer is reduced creating less protection and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>pollution.</b> Certain sewage facilities also gave high marks, especially those located near the well area vicinity with infiltration directly into the soil and thus connected to the groundwater. Such things as car- wash detergents can easily penetrate the soil layer, especially in coarse-grained soils where factors as permeability and hydraulic conductivity is of a great influence for the process To get a better understanding of permeability in different soils and knowledge of individual sewage risks and risk management, a literature review was conducted. Also contact with the municipality of Luleå, the Geological Survey of Sweden and SMHI was made. Several field visits were made in the Rörbäck area, however due to harsh winter conditions a detailed localization of the sludge wells in the area was not possible. This is an area worth following up on in future investigations. Validerat; 20111116 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Oil pollutions are {{widespread}} environmental pollutants. Most of {{the studies}} have {{been focused on the}} biodegradation of these pollutions. Unfortunately, the information on the microflore of the polluted regions especially for microalgae is limited. In this research, we have focused on Masjed Soleiman; one of the most oil polluted cities in Iran. Soil and water samples were collected from different stations and seasons and their microalgae identified morphologically and molecularly. TPH, PAH and heavy metals of these stations were analyzed. The relationship between TPH contents and micro algal populations has also been considered. Results showed microalgae, present in these regions belonged to Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta and Diatoms. Among them Phormidium sp. was the most dominant species that was found in all polluted regions. Microalgae biomass, declined in high level polluted medium, whereas low levels of TPH showed no effect on microbial biomass. According to the results the isolated specimens have high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> environmental <b>pollutions.</b> So the type and frequency of the species, can lead us to estimate the amount of pollution in different sampling regions.

40|$|Freshwater {{ecosystems}} {{are subject to}} a wide variety of stressors, which can have complex interactions and result in ecological surprises. Non-native fish introductions have drastically reduced the number of naturally fishless lakes and have resulted in cascading food web repercussions in aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Additional anthropogenic influences that result from increases in global airborne emissions also threaten wildlife habitat. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition has been recognized as an anthropogenic contributor to acidification and eutrophication of wilderness ecosystems. Planktonic communities have shown declines in response to predation and shifts in composition as a result of nutrient inputs and acidification, both of which are potential fates of nitrogen deposition. This study identified the response of zooplankton communities from two lakes (fish present vs. absent) in Mount Rainier National Park to manipulations simulating an episodic disturbance event in mesocosms. The experiment used a 2 x 2 factorial design with acid and nitrogen treatments. Treatments resulted in significantly elevated nitrogen and decreased pH conditions from control mesocosms over 42 days, indicating that the treatment effects were achieved. Results indicate that zooplankton communities from lakes with different food web structure respond differently to the singular effects of acid and nitrogen addition. Surprisingly, the interaction of the two stressors was related to increases in community metrics (e. g., abundance, biomass, body size, richness, and Shannon-Weiner diversity) for both lake types. This work can aid management decisions as agencies look to restore more aquatic montane habitats to their historic fishless states, and assess their abilities to recover and afford <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> atmospheric <b>pollution...</b>|$|R
