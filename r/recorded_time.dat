50|$|Technically, any DV {{cassette}} {{can record}} any variant of DV video. Nevertheless, manufacturers often label cassettes with DV, DVCAM, DVCPRO, DVCPRO50 or DVCPRO HD and indicate <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> {{with regards to}} the label posted. Cassettes labeled as DV indicate <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> of baseline DV; another number can indicate <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> of Long Play DV. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO have a yellow tape door and indicate <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> when DVCPRO25 is used; with DVCPRO50 the <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> is half, with DVCPRO HD it is a quarter. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO50 have a blue tape door and indicate <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> when DVCPRO50 is used. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO HD have a red tape door and indicate <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> when DVCPRO HD-LP format is used; a second number may be used for DVCPRO HD recording, which will be half as long.|$|R

25|$|Time and a Word is {{the second}} studio album from the English rock band Yes, {{released}} by Atlantic Records in July 1970 in the UK and in November 1970 in the U.S. Several months after releasing their debut album Yes, the group resumed touring and <b>recorded</b> <b>Time</b> and a Word at Advision Studios in London during gaps between shows. The group continued to follow their early musical direction of performing original material and cover versions of songs by pop, jazz, and folk artists. A small orchestra of brass and string session musicians was used {{on most of the}} album's songs.|$|E
25|$|A hat-trick {{occurs in}} {{association}} football when a player scores three goals (not necessarily consecutive) {{in a single}} game, whereas scoring two goals constitutes a brace. In common with other official record-keeping rules, goals in a penalty shootout are excluded from the tally. The extra time in a knockout cup match may also be calculated towards a player's potential hat-trick. The fastest <b>recorded</b> <b>time</b> to score a hat-trick is 70 seconds, a record set by Alex Torr in a Sunday league game in 2013. The previous record of 90 seconds was held by Tommy Ross playing for Ross County against Nairn County on 28 November 1964.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, {{a trophy}} was {{introduced}} for pole position, named after Allan Simonsen {{who died at}} the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans. Simonsen, who had raced several times in Australia {{as part of a}} long and varied career, held the Bathurst 12 Hour race lap record at the time as well as driving the fastest officially timed lap around Mount Panorama in a closed-wheel car. The introduction of the trophy coincided with the relaxing of qualifying restrictions from previous years, with the removal of the minimum allowed lap time (two minutes and six seconds), therefore allowing a major improvement in qualifying times. In 2014, Simonsen's former team at the 12 Hour, Maranello Motorsport, narrowly missed pole to Maro Engel by less than a tenth of a second. Maranello {{went on to win the}} race itself. In 2015, Laurens Vanthoor set the fastest ever officially <b>recorded</b> <b>time</b> of Mount Panorama in qualifying. This time was only to last twelve months, with Shane van Gisbergen beating the time by over one second in qualifying for the 2016 race. In 2017 a top ten shootout was introduced, as per the Bathurst 1000, with the fastest time winning the trophy.|$|E
500|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of {{artillery}} pieces taken to Viborg differ widely according to the various sources. In most sources, including Journal ... of Emperor Peter the Great from 1698 to the Treaty of Nystad, [...] "Report on the capture of Vyborg", [...] "The Life and Affairs of the Great Sovereign", and The Vyborg Fortress: Chronicles from 1710 to 1872, it is said that there were ten 12-pounder guns and three mortars. N. G. Ustryalov believed that there were ten 12-pounders and five mortars, M. M. Borodkin counted 24 cannon and four mortars, and M. V. Vasiliev 12 cannon and four mortars, although none of these historians give their sources for their figures. A letter from Fyodor Apraksin to Peter the Great dated 2 April 1710 stated that [...] "the enemy has constructed three batteries against us; they shoot powerfully and accurately: one of our cannon, they have broken, another blew up from frequent firing; we have, remaining, 10 cannon in our batteries." [...] (This was the only <b>recorded</b> <b>time</b> during the siege when Swedish artillery managed to disable Russian equipment.) Thus, Myshlaevsky concluded that there were originally 12 cannon brought to Viborg, but only ten of them were used in the siege, as two of them were disabled. There were probably three mortars, although there are no primary sources to validate this.|$|E

6000|$|Another {{class of}} considerations--of a {{different}} kind, it is true, but tending {{in the same}} direction--seems to have been overlooked. Not only {{is it true that}} the general plan of construction of animals and plants has been the same in all <b>recorded</b> <b>time</b> as at present, but there are particular kinds of animals and plants which have existed throughout vast epochs, sometimes through the whole range of <b>recorded</b> <b>time,</b> with very little change.

60|$|He started, as we {{have already}} seen, in middle fourth form. In the spring of 1822 Hawtrey said to him: 'Continue to {{do as well as}} this, and I will send you up for good again before the fourth of June.' Before the end of June, he tells his sailor brother of his success: 'It far exceeds the most {{sanguine}} expectations I ever entertained. I have got into the remove between the fourth and fifth forms. I have been sent up for good a second time, and have taken seven places.' In the summer of 1823 he announces that he has got into the fifth form after taking sixteen places, and here instead of fagging he acquires the blessed power himself to fag. In passing he launches, for the first <b>recorded</b> <b>time,</b> against the master of the remove from which he has just been promoted, an invective that in volume and intensity anticipates the wrath of later attacks on Neapolitan kings and Turkish sultans.|$|E
60|$|One other point, before I conclude, {{about this}} matter. These reefs, {{as you have}} just perceived, are in a most {{singular}} and unexpected manner indications of physical changes of elevations and depressions going on upon {{the surface of the}} globe. I dare say it may have surprised you to hear me talk in this familiar sort of way of land going up and down; but {{it is one of the}} universal lessons of geology that the land is going down and going up, and has been going up and down, in all sorts of places and to all sorts of distances, through all <b>recorded</b> <b>time.</b> Geologists would be quite right in maintaining the seeming paradox that the stable thing in the world is the fluid sea and the shifting thing is the solid land. That may sound a very hard saying at first, but the more you look into geology, the more you will see ground for believing that it is not a mere paradox.|$|E
60|$|If the {{formation}} of individual character is already a complex subject of study, this subject must be, in appearance at least, still more complex; {{because the number of}} concurrent causes, all exercising more or less influence on the total effect, is greater, in the proportion in which a nation, or the species at large, exposes a larger surface to the operation of agents, psychological and physical, than any single individual. If it was necessary to prove, in opposition to an existing prejudice, that the simpler of the two is capable of being a subject of science, the prejudice is likely to be yet stronger against the possibility of giving a scientific character to the study of Politics, and of the phenomena of Society. It is, accordingly, but of yesterday that the conception of a political or social science has existed anywhere but in the mind of here and there an insulated thinker, generally very ill prepared for its realization: though the subject itself has of all others engaged the most general attention, and been a theme of interested and earnest discussions, almost from the beginning of <b>recorded</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

60|$|The {{world has}} {{by this time}} {{discovered}} {{that it is impossible}} to destroy the Jews. The attempt to extirpate them has been made under the most favourable auspices and on the largest scale; the most considerable means that man could command have been pertinaciously applied to this object for the longest period of <b>recorded</b> <b>time.</b> Egyptian Pharaohs, Assyrian kings, Roman emperors, Scandinavian crusaders, Gothic princes, and holy inquisitors have alike devoted their energies to the fulfilment of this common purpose. Expatriation, exile, captivity, confiscation, torture on the most ingenious, and massacre on the most extensive, scale, with a curious system of degrading customs and debasing laws which would have broken the heart of any other people, have been tried, and in vain. The Jews, after all this havoc, are probably more numerous at this date than they were during the reign of Solomon the Wise, are found in all lands, and, unfortunately, prospering in most. All of which proves that it is in vain for man to attempt to battle the inexorable law of nature, which has decreed that a superior race shall never be destroyed or absorbed by an inferior.|$|E

60|$|And {{looking back}} through the prodigious vista of the past, I find no record of the {{commencement}} of life, and therefore I am devoid of any means of forming a definite conclusion as to the conditions of its appearance. Belief, in the scientific sense of the word, is a serious matter, and needs strong foundations. To say, therefore, in the admitted absence of evidence, that I have any belief as to the mode in which the existing forms of life have originated, would be using words in a wrong sense. But expectation is permissible where belief is not; {{and if it were}} given me to look beyond the abyss of geologically <b>recorded</b> <b>time</b> to the still more remote period when the earth was passing through physical and chemical conditions, which it can no more see again than a man can recall his infancy, I should expect to be a witness of the evolution of living protoplasm from not living matter. I should expect to see it appear under forms of great simplicity, endowed, like existing fungi, with the power of determining the formation of new protoplasm from such matters as ammonium carbonates, oxalates and tartrates, alkaline and earthy phosphates, and water, without the aid of light. That is the expectation to which analogical reasoning leads me; but I beg you once more to recollect that I have no right to call my opinion anything but an act of philosophical faith.|$|E
