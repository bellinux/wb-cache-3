Differences in search times are as well significant, but relatively small compared with the total time for recovery of a buried victim. A recently proposed method to determine search strip width based on maximum range measurements in coaxial antenna orientation was verified and can be recommended...|$|R

50|$|After a light {{plane with}} two U.S. congressmen on board {{went down in}} 1972 {{and could not be}} found, the U.S. began {{requiring}} all aircraft to carry an Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) that would turn on automatically {{in the event of a}} crash. Initially these units sent beacon signals on the 121.5 MHz aircraft emergency frequency. These are being phased out in favor of <b>rescue</b> <b>beacons</b> that use a 406.025 MHz signal, which can be picked up by the Cospas-Sarsat international satellite system for search and rescue. Each 406 MHz beacon has a unique digital ID code. Users are required to register the code with the Cospas-Sarsat, allowing inquiries to be made when a distress signal is picked up. Some advanced models can transmit a location derived from an internal GPS or GLONASS receiver.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>rescue</b> <b>beacon</b> systems {{had already}} been {{developed}} and deployed, but Stevinson felt these were insufficient. If the crash occurred over water, the beacon would sink with the aircraft even if the crew escaped and were on the surface. Over land, the aircraft itself would block the signal if the beacon ended up buried under the fuselage, and the crash and any post-crash fires had the possibility of destroying it.|$|E

Both Detour options required teams to drive themselves to The Lodge of The Ten Peaks in Lake Louise and pick up skiing equipment before taking the ski lift up the mountain. In Search, teams had to use an avalanche <b>rescue</b> <b>beacon</b> to search a marked area for a transmitter buried beneath the snow. Once teams dig up this transmitter, they could exchange it for their next clue. In Ski, both team members {{had to go through}} a slalom skiing course, passing through all the flags, in order to receive their next clue.|$|E

50|$|The search {{with the}} Recco {{detector}} {{is very similar}} to how an avalanche <b>rescue</b> <b>beacon</b> search is performed. The avalanche debris area is searched in 20m wide corridors. The detector can be used by a rescuer on foot, skis, or from a helicopter who aims the detector toward the snow. Once a signal is heard the operator orients the detector to the strongest signal and follows the tone—along a straight line. When the tone disappears the rescuer is right above the victim. The detector is then aimed downwards at the snow and several rapid crisscross sweeps are done to pinpoint the signal. Unlike an avalanche beacon the Recco detector is truly directional and accurately pinpoints the location. A probe pole is recommended to determine the burial depth.|$|E

The Arctic Regional Communications small SATellite (ARCSAT) initiative would launch a Mini-Satellite "Mothership" into Polar or Sun Sync low-earth-orbit (LEO). Once on orbit, the Mothership would perform orbital insertion of four internally stored independently maneuverable nanosatellites, each containing electronically steerable antennas and reconfigurable software-defined radios. Unlike the traditional geostationary larger complex satellite communication systems, this LEO communications system will be comprised of initially a five small satellite formation that can be later incrementally increased in {{the total number of}} satellites for additional data coverage.

After the party, Gloria finds that Alex is acting strange because he didn't eat any food during the party, and tells Melman to go find steak while she goes to find Marty, Melman fails in finding steak, and meets up with Maurice, Gloria and Marty. Marty announces that Alex bit him on the butt.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{develops}} {{a set of}} methods enabling an information-theoretic distributed control architecture based on particle filters to facilitate search by a mobile sensor network, permitting the use of nonlinear and non-Gaussian sensor models. Given a particular configuration sensors, this technique exploits {{the structure of the}} probability distributions of the target state and of the sensor measurements to compute the control inputs to the mobile sensors leading to future observations that minimize, in expectation, the future uncertainty of the target state. We compute the mutual information using a particle set representation of the posterior distribution. In order to control a large number of mobile sensors as a network, singlenode and pairwise-node approximation schemes are presented, with analytically bounded error, making the approach scalable to increasing network sizes, while still planning cooperatively. The methods are applied in simulation to bearings-only sensing, and to localizing an avalanche <b>rescue</b> <b>beacon</b> of a buried victim, using transceivers on quadrotor aircraft to measure the magnetic field. Monte Carlo simulations also demonstrate that as network size increases, the sensors more quickly localize the target, and the pairwise-node approximation results in superior performance to the single-node approximation.

40|$|During {{the last}} four winters (2009 / 10 - 2012 / 13), 37 {{people have been killed}} by {{avalanches}} in Norway. Some of them died while skiing or snowboarding, others while walking or snowmobiling. In comparison, 12 people died in avalanches during the previous four-year-period (snoskred. no). In this Master thesis I have been looking into the effect of different feedback approaches in a training situation. My work has been {{based on the idea that}} feedback, in an educational context, should reduce the gap between what is understood or performed, and the aim of the task (Hattie & Thimperley, 2007). However, this may be difficult to put into practice. For this reason, Shute (2008) says that good feedback can significantly improve learning processes and outcomes, if delivered correctly (p. 154) ". It is those three words if delivered correctly", I have devoted my attention to in this study. These three words are also the reason why I ask: Which feedback approach causes the strongest effect on initial learning in companion rescue with beacon? This study used a quantitative research design, based on a between- groups design. The effect of external, immediate feedback was measured against internal, delayed feedback on three tests (pre-, post- and retention test). The criteria for effect size measurement were the timing of applied search time and a structured observation of to what extent the procedure was followed and the way the participants of the study submitted to the procedure. The study shows that there was no difference between the groups, when it comes to search time, on any of the tests. The results of the test concerning to what extent the procedure was followed showed that the group that got external, immediate feedback scored significantly higher than the group that got internal, delayed feedback. However, for the sample as a whole it was just a weak correlation between search time and to what extent the procedure was followed. In return, the retention test showed a strong correlation between the search time and and how the procedure was followed by the group that that got external, immediate feedback. Here, all the seven fastest searchtimes had a higher score than average, when it came to following the procedure.

40|$|Low Earth Orbit (LEO) {{satellites}} have {{a limited}} direct contact time with the stations of their ground segment. This fundamentally constraints a timeliness reaction of the mission control center in case of emergency situations onboard the LEO spacecraft. To enable such a rapid reaction to emergency situations onboard LEO satellites, it is proposed to use a Search and <b>Rescue</b> (SAR) <b>beacon</b> onboard that spacecraft to transmit an alert message via Galileo satellites which support SAR through the Cospas-Sarsat (C/S) system to the satellite mission control center. While SAR up to now is limited to terrestrial, maritime, and aviation user scenarios, this space user concept presents a novel emergency system which helps facilitating the valuable space assets which LEO satellites in many cases represent. However, such a space user system faces various technical, system, and business challenges as well as legal and regulatory issues. The frequency band assigned for the SAR system is limited to low power satellite emergency position-indicating radio beacons and is foreseen for earth-space transmissions only. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) should agree on opening this band for space-space communication for space user distress beacons. The Distress Alerting Satellite System (DASS) and the SAR/Glonass system will also operate in this band and an agreement will be required for these as well.
