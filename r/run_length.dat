INTRODUCTION Simulation experiments are like exploring trips. We usually have initial goals, but the interesting discoveries often come from the unexpected. We typically do not know in advance precisely how we will proceed and we cannot predict all the benefits. In reality, most simulation experiments are sequences of experiments, with new goals being based on successive discoveries; see Albin (1984). Thus, there obviously is a limit to [...] ...|$|R

50|$|For {{reliable}} {{clock recovery}} at the receiver, one usually imposes a maximum <b>run</b> <b>length</b> constraint on the generated channel sequence, i.e., {{the maximum number}} of consecutive ones or zeros is bounded to a reasonable number. A clock period is recovered by observing transitions in the received sequence, so that a maximum <b>run</b> <b>length</b> guarantees such clock recovery, while sequences without such a constraint could seriously hamper the detection quality.|$|E

40|$|Performance on {{concurrent}} schedules can be decomposed to <b>run</b> <b>lengths</b> (the {{number of}} responses before switching alternatives), or visit durations (time at an alternative before switching alternatives), that are {{a function of the}} ratio of the rates of reinforcement for staying and switching. From this analysis, a model of concurrent performance was developed and examined in two experiments. The first exposed rats to variable-interval schedules for staying and for switching, which included a changeover delay for reinforcers following a switch. With the changeover delay, <b>run</b> <b>lengths</b> and visit durations were functions of the ratios of the rates of reinforcement for staying and for switching, as found by previous research not using a changeover delay. The second directly assessed the effect of a changeover delay on <b>run</b> <b>lengths</b> and visit durations. Each component of a multiple schedule consisted of equivalent stay and switch schedules but only one component included a changeover delay. <b>Run</b> <b>lengths</b> and visit durations were longer when a changeover delay was used. Because visit duration is the reciprocal of changeover rate, these results are consistent with the established finding that a changeover delay reduces the frequency of switching. Together these results support the local model of concurrent performance {{as an alternative to the}} generalized matching law as a model of concurrent performance. The local model may be preferred when accounting for more molecular aspects of concurrent performance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMammalian KIF 3 AC is {{classified}} as a heterotrimeric kinesin- 2 that {{is best known for}} organelle transport in neurons, yet in vitro studies to characterize its single molecule behavior are lacking. The results presented show that a KIF 3 AC motor that includes the native helix α 7 sequence for coiled-coil formation is highly processive with <b>run</b> <b>lengths</b> of ∼ 1. 23 μm and matching those exhibited by conventional kinesin- 1. This result was unexpected because KIF 3 AC exhibits the canonical kinesin- 2 neck-linker sequence that has been reported to be responsible for shorter <b>run</b> <b>lengths</b> observed for another heterotrimeric kinesin- 2, KIF 3 AB. However, KIF 3 AB with its native neck linker and helix α 7 is also highly processive with <b>run</b> <b>lengths</b> of ∼ 1. 62 μm and exceeding those of KIF 3 AC and kinesin- 1. Loop L 11, a component of the microtubule-motor interface and implicated in activating ADP release upon microtubule collision, is significantly extended in KIF 3 C as compared with other kinesins. A KIF 3 AC encoding a truncation in KIF 3 C loop L 11 (KIF 3 ACΔL 11) exhibited longer <b>run</b> <b>lengths</b> at ∼ 1. 55 μm than wild-type KIF 3 AC and were more similar to KIF 3 AB <b>run</b> <b>lengths,</b> suggesting that L 11 also contributes to tuning motor processivity. The steady-state ATPase results show that shortening L 11 does not alter kcat, consistent with the observation that single molecule velocities are not affected by this truncation. However, shortening loop L 11 of KIF 3 C significantly increases the microtubule affinity of KIF 3 ACΔL 11, revealing another structural and mechanistic property that can modulate processivity. The results presented provide new, to our knowledge, insights to understand structure-function relationships governing processivity and {{a better understanding of the}} potential of KIF 3 AC for long-distance transport in neurons...|$|R
