40|$|Core {{samples taken}} during Leg 121 {{drilling}} aboard the JOIDES Resolution {{in the central}} Indian Ocean were analyzed for their low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon contents. Forty-three samples from the Broken Ridge and 39 samples from the Ninetyeast <b>Ridge</b> <b>drill</b> sites, deep-frozen on board immediately after recovery, were studied by a dynamic headspace technique (hydrogen-stripping/thermovaporization). Light hydrocarbons (saturated and olefinic) with two to four carbon atoms, and toluene as a selected aromatic compound, were identified. Total C 2 -C 4 saturated hydrocarbon yields vary considerably from virtually zero in a Paleogene calcareous ooze from Hole 757 B to nearly 600 nanogram/gram of dry-weight sediment (parts per billion) in a Cretaceous claystone from Hole 758 A. An increase of light-hydrocarbon yields with depth, and hence with sediment temperature, was observed from Hole 758 A samples down {{to a depth of}} about 500 meters below seafloor. Despite extreme data scatter due to lithological changes over this depth interval, this increased yield indicates the onset of temperature-controlled hydrocarbon formation reactions. Toluene contents are also extremely variable (generally between 10 and 100 ppb) and reach more than 300 ppb in two samples of tuffaceous lithology (Sections 121 - 755 A- 17 R- 4 and 121 - 758 A- 48 R- 4). As for the saturated hydrocarbons, there was also an increase of toluene yields with increasing depth in Hole 758 A...|$|E

This study was conducted for 2 seasons to establish optimal sowing method and seeding rate for bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in sandy-loam soil. The study aimed at achieving high yield and profit. A field experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block in split plot design with three planting techniques (hilling in <b>ridges,</b> <b>drilling</b> in rows and broadcasting) and four seeding rates (100, 125, 150 and 175 kg ha - 1) as the main plot and split plot, respectively. Results revealed that all yield and yield parameters were significantly affected by the sowing method and seed rate, while grain protein content was non-significant by these factors. The interaction of sowing method and seed rate significantly affected the number of effective tillers m - 2, weight of grains spike - 1, grain and straw yields ha - 1 and harvest index. Wheat sown by drilling method at the seed rate 150 kg ha - 1 gave the highest values of grain and straw yields ha - 1 and harvest index and this treatment was found to be most economical. Based on these results, it is recommended to sow 150 kg ha - 1 seeds by using drill method for planting bread wheat Giza 168 cv under similar soil and climatic conditions.

40|$|Abstract: Downhole logs {{have proven}} to be {{critical}} in quantifying natural gas hydrates found in marine sediments and the seismic signature associated with free gas below. In recent drilling on the Blake <b>Ridge,</b> the Ocean <b>Drilling</b> Program recorded in situ velocity and resistivity logs that reveal an increasing amount of hydrate with depth in the pressure-temperature stability window. The associated increase in shear igidity (decrease in Vp/Vs ratio) and decrease in acoustic amplitude over this interval is attributed to the cementation of sediment grains by hydrate, which may also explain the prevalent seismic Nanking across the Blake <b>Ridge.</b> In future <b>drilling</b> campaigns, the use of 'logging-while-drilling' (LWD) sensors placed just above the drill bit will improve the in situ estimation ofporosity, lateral variability and hydrocarbon reservoir potential of natural gas hydrates. Downhole logs in sedimentary basins can reveal in situ properties that are difficult to measure in laboratory samples, such as those in gas hydrates and gas-rich zones which dissociate or severely alter during the process of coring.

40|$|Accurate age {{models are}} {{a tool of}} utmost {{important}} in paleoclimatology. Constraining the rate and pace of past climate change are {{at the core of}} paleoclimate research, as such knowledge is crucial {{to our understanding of the}} climate system. Indeed, it allows for the disentanglement of the various drivers of climate change. The scarcity of highly resolved sedimentary records from the middle Eocene (Bartonian - Lutetian Stages; 47. 8 - 37. 8 Ma) has led to the existence of the "Eocene astronomical time scale gap" and hindered the establishment of a comprehensive astronomical time scale (ATS) for the entire Cenozoic. Sediments from the Newfoundland <b>Ridge</b> <b>drilled</b> during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 342 span the Eocene gap at an unprecedented stratigraphic resolution with carbonate bearing sediments. Moreover, these sediments exhibit cyclic lithological changes that allow for an astronomical calibration of geologic time. In this study, we use the dominant obliquity imprint in XRF-derived calcium-iron ratio series (Ca/Fe) from three sites drilled during IODP Expedition 342 (U 1408, U 1409, U 1410) to construct a floating astrochronology. We then anchor this chronology to numerical geological time by tuning 173 -kyr cycles in the amplitude modulation pattern of obliquity to an astronomical solution. This study is one of the first to use the 173 -kyr obliquity amplitude cycle for astrochronologic purposes, as previous studies primarily use the 405 -kyr long eccentricity cycle as a tuning target to calibrate the Paleogene geologic time scale. We demonstrate that the 173 -kyr cycles in obliquity's amplitude are stable between 40 and 50 Ma, which means that one can use the 173 -kyr cycle for astrochronologic calibration in the Eocene. Our tuning provides new age estimates for magnetochron reversals C 18 n. 1 n - C 21 r and a stratigraphic framework for key sites from Expedition 342 for the Eocene. Some disagreements emerge when we compare our tuning for the interval between C 19 r and C 20 r with previous tuning attempts from the South Atlantic. We therefore present a revision of the original astronomical interpretations for the latter records, so that the various astrochronologic age models for the middle Eocene in the North- and South-Atlantic are consistent...|$|R
40|$|In 2004, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 302 (Arctic Coring Expedition, ACEX) to the Lomonosov <b>Ridge</b> <b>drilled</b> {{the first}} Central Arctic Ocean {{sediment}} record reaching the uppermost Cretaceous (~ 430 m composite depth). While the Neogene {{part of the}} record is characterized by grayish-yellowish siliciclastic material, the Paleogene part is dominated by biosiliceous black shale-type sediments. The lithological transition between Paleogene and Neogene deposits was initially interpreted as a single sedimentological unconformity (hiatus) of ~ 26 Ma duration, separating Eocene from Miocene strata. More recently, however, continuous sedimentation on Lomonosov Ridge throughout the Cenozoic was proclaimed, questioning {{the existence of a}} hiatus. In this context, we studied the elemental and mineralogical sediment composition around the Paleogene-Neogene transition at high resolution to reconstruct variations in the depositional regime (e. g. wave/current activity, detrital provenance, and bottom water redox conditions). Already below the hiatus, mineralogical and geochemical proxies imply drastic changes in sediment provenance and/or weathering intensity in the hinterland, and point to the existence of another, earlier gap in the sediment record. The sediments directly overlying the hiatus (the Zebra interval) are characterized by pronounced and abrupt compositional changes that suggest repeated erosion and re-deposition of material. Regarding redox conditions, euxinic bottom waters prevailed at the Eocene Lomonosov Ridge, and became even more severe directly before the hiatus. With detrital sedimentation rates decreasing, authigenic trace metals were highly enriched in the sediment. This continuous authigenic trace metal enrichment under persistent euxinia implies that the Arctic trace metal pool was renewed continuously by water mass exchange with the world ocean, so the Eocene Arctic Ocean was not fully restricted. Above the hiatus, extreme positive Ce anomalies are clear signs of a periodically well-oxygenated water column, but redox conditions were highly variable during deposition of the Zebra interval. Significant Mn enrichments only occur above the Zebra interval, documenting the Miocene establishment of stable oxic conditions in the Arctic Ocean. In summary, extreme and abrupt changes in geochemistry and mineralogy across the studied sediment section do not suggest continuous sedimentation at the Lomonosov Ridge around the Eocene-Miocene transition, but imply repeated periods of very low sedimentation rates and/or erosion...|$|R

Measurements of peak width, spin density and power saturation for site 857 kerogens, which increased regularly in maturity downhole, show correlation with vitrinite reflectance values from 0. 61 to 2. 5 %, indicating {{the start of the}} oil window at depths from 200 to 400 m. Spin density increases to 1. 56 * 10 ** 17 spins per gram and peak width decreases to 3. 45 G (gauss) with increasing depth. The tendency to power saturate also decreases with increasing maturity and increasing vitrinite reflectance within the oil window. These trends are consistent with a model in which exchange processes are occurring and cause changes in the EPR behavior of samples from this site.

40|$|The Cenozoic {{record of}} the Lomonosov Ridge (central Arctic Ocean) {{recovered}} during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 302 revealed an unexpected 26 Ma hiatus, separating middle Eocene (� 44. 4 Ma) from lower Miocene sediments (� 18. 2 Ma). To elucidate {{the nature of this}} unconformity, we performed a multiproxy palynological (dinoflagellate cysts, pollen, and spores), micropaleontological (siliceous microfossils), inorganic, and organic (Tetra Ether Index of lipids with 86 carbon atoms (TEX 86) and Branched and Isoprenoid Tetraether (BIT)) geochemical analysis of the sediments from � 5 m below to � 7 m above the hiatus. Four main paleoenvironmental phases (A–D) are recognized in the sediments encompassing the unconformity, two below (A–B) and two above (C–D) : (A) Below the hiatus, proxies show relatively warm temperatures, with Sea Surface Temperatures (TEX 86 -derived SSTs) of about 8 �C and high fresh to brackish water influence. (B) Approaching the hiatus, proxies indicate a cooling trend (TEX 86 -derived SSTs of � 5 �C), increased freshwater influence, and progressive shoaling of the Lomonosov <b>Ridge</b> <b>drilling</b> site, located close to or at sea level. (C) The interval directly above the unconformity contains sparse reworked Cretaceous to Oligocene dinoflagellate cysts. Sediments were deposited in a relatively shallow, restricted marine environment. Proxies show the simultaneous influence of both fresh and marine waters, with alternating oxic and anoxic conditions. Pollen indicates a relatively cold climate. Intriguingly, TEX 86 -derived SSTs are unexpectedly high, � 15 – 19 �C. Such warm surface waters may be partially explained by the ingression of warmer North Atlantic waters after the opening of the Fram Strait during the early Miocene. (D) Sediments of the uppermost interval indicate a phase of extreme oxic conditions, and a well-ventilated environment, which occurred after the complete opening of the Fram Strait. Importantly, and in contrast with classical postrifting thermal subsidence models for passive margins, our data suggest that sediment erosion and/or nondeposition that generated the hiatus was likely due to a progressive shoaling of the Lomonosov Ridge. A shallow water setting {{both before and after the}} hiatus suggests that the Lomonosov Ridge remained at or near sea level for the duration of the gap in the sedimentary record. Interacting sea level changes and/or tectonic activity (possibly uplift) must be invoked as possible causes for such a long hiatus...|$|R

The primary purpose of these experiments was to compare the resulting solution chemistries to estimate the degree of homogeneity that might be expected in thermally affected ground water in a potential nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. The second purpose was to relate data obtained from welded devitrified Topopah Spring tuff collected from the potential repository depth to that previously obtained using outcrop samples. The results show very similar aqueous phase chemistries for all samples after reaction for times up to 70 days. The largest difference in final solution concentrations was for silica {{in one of the}} samples from Fran <b>Ridge.</b> All vertical <b>drill</b> core samples gave results for silica that were in agreement to within +- 6 ppM and indicated solubility controlled by cristobalite. The results for reaction at 150 {sup 0 }C are in agreement with those obtained in previous experiments using surface outcrop samples from Fran Ridge. The major difference between the drill core results and the outcrop samples is found in the data for room-temperature rinse solutions. The outcrop samples show relatively large amounts of soluble salts that can be easily removed at room temperature. The data for room-temperature rinsing of drill core samples show no significant quantities of readily soluble salts. This result is particularly significant for the samples from the air-drilled hole at Fran <b>Ridge,</b> since <b>drilling</b> fluid that might have removed soluble salts was not used in the portion of the hole from which the samples were obtained.

U enrichment factors (U EFs) generally exceed crustal values and indicate slightly reducing environments. However, authigenic U precipitation can also {{be influenced by the}} organic carbon rain rate and may not be solely an indicator of redox conditions. Dramatic changes in Mn EFs at ~ 162 mcd, from values between 12 and 93 to values 15 µmol P/g. Ba excess follows the same general trends as Preactive, with concentrations 15 µmol Ba/g. Accumulation rate records of these proxies will be needed to infer paleoproductivity. P reactive/Ba excess ratios, an indicator of the relative burial of the nutrient P to organic carbon export, exhibit higher values, similar to modern, from the base of our record through ~ 180 mcd. The remainder of the record exhibits values lower than modern, indicating that organic carbon export to the sediments was higher relative to nutrient burial...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{routinely}} used nannofossil datums in {{the late}} Neogene and Quaternary were identified at three Blake <b>Ridge</b> sites <b>drilled</b> during Leg 164. The quantitative investigation of the nannofossil assemblages in 236 samples selected from Hole 994 C provide new biostratigraphic and paleoceanographic information. Although mostly overlooked previously, Umbilicosphaera aequiscutum is an abundant component of the late Neogene flora, and its last occurrence at ~ 2. 3 Ma is a useful new biostratigraphic event. Small Gephyrocapsa evolved within {{the upper part of}} Subzone CN 11 a (~ 4. 3 Ma), and after an initial acme, it temporarily disappeared for 400 k. y., between 2. 9 and 2. 5 Ma. Medium-sized Gephyrocapsa evolved {{in the late}}st Pliocene ~ 2. 2 Ma), and after two short temporary disappearances, common specimens occurred continuously just above the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary. The base of Subzone CN 13 b should be recognized as the beginning of the continuous occurrence of medium-sized (> 4 µm) Gephyrocapsa. Stratigraphic variation in abundance of the very small placoliths and Florisphaera profunda alternated, indicating potential of the former as a proxy for the paleoproductivity. At this site, it is likely that upwelling took place during three time periods in the late Neogene (6. 0 - 4. 6 Ma, 2. 3 - 2. 1 Ma, and 2. 0 - 1. 8 Ma) and also in the early Pleistocene (1. 4 - 0. 9 Ma). Weak upwelling is also likely to have occurred intermittently through the late Pliocene. Due to the sharp and abrupt turnover of the nannofossils, which resulted from an evolution of very competitive species, the paleoproductivity of the late Pleistocene is not clear. The site was mostly in an oligotrophic central gyre setting during the 4. 6 - to 2. 3 -Ma interval, intermittently between 2. 1 and 1. 4 Ma, and continuously for the last several tens of thousand years...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} 72 index {{properties}} analyses and 29 high-pressure velocity experiments on samples of sediment, basalt, and sulfide rocks recovered during Leg 169 of the Ocean Drilling Program are presented. The large sample set {{was subjected to}} shore-based index properties measurements from which wet bulk densities (b), grain densities (g), and porosities were calculated. The majority of samples are from Sites 856 and 1035 in the Bent Hill area of Middle Valley, part of the northern Juan de Fuca Ridge. Four basalts are from Holes 1037 B and 1038 I drilled in the Escanaba Trough of the Gorda <b>Ridge.</b> Reentry <b>drilling</b> of Hole 856 H below 93. 8 meters below seafloor (mbsf) resulted in penetration of a complete Bent Hill Massive Sulfide (BHMS) area reference section below the massive sulfide deposit drilled during Leg 139. Physical properties samples {{were obtained from the}} underlying sulfide feeder zone section of mineralized sediments (Unit VI), a deeper interbedded hemipelagic and turbiditic sediment interval (Unit II), the intercalated sills and sediment of "hydrothermal basement" (Unit VII), and the basaltic flows of interpreted oceanic basement (Unit VIII). Elevated-pressure velocity measurements of sediments from Units II and VI, sediment interbeds of Unit VII, and basalts of Unit VIII were made for the first time. The presence of sulfide minerals as disseminations, blebs, and vein infillings affects the velocity and density signatures of sediment samples from cores {{in the vicinity of the}} BHMS (Site 1035). Densities, velocities, and porosities of massive sulfides (Unit V; Holes 1035 F and 1035 H) and basaltic sills (Hole 856 H) are comparable to Leg 139 data for sulfides from 0. 0 to 93. 8 mbsf in Hole 856 H and Hole 857 D sills...|$|R

Geochemical conditions favourable for formation and preservation of greigite and pyrrhotite {{appear to be a}} limited source of sulphide, whether it derives from microbially-driven sulphate reduction in the sulphate zone, in the AOM zone or in deep sediments undergoing AOM, so that pyritization reactions are not driven to completion. Our results indicate that rock magnetic identification of greigite and pyrrhotite should be useful for detecting ancient gas hydrate systems in the marine sedimentary record, because it can enable rapid screening of ancient sediments for potential horizons where methane and disseminated gas hydrates might have occurred. Formation of authigenic greigite and pyrrhotite at different depths within the gas hydrate stability zone also implies that the magnetization of the host sediments will have been acquired at variable times, which is likely to compromise paleomagnetic results from greigite- and pyrrhotite-bearing marine sediments. <br/...|$|R
40|$|<b>Drilling</b> at Broken <b>Ridge</b> and Ninetyeast <b>Ridge</b> during Ocean <b>Drilling</b> Program Leg 121 yielded thick {{sections}} of Upper Cretaceous nannofossil-bearing sediments including calcareous chalk, limestone with chert, and volcanic ash. The upper Campanian to Maestrichtian assemblages from Broken Ridge are austral in nature, containing {{many of the}} endemic Southern Ocean forms observed from the Falkland Plateau, Weddell Sea, and the Kerguelen Plateau. The absence of the Lithraphidites praequadratus-L. quadratus lineage and significant overlap of the first-appearance datum of Nephrolithus frequens and the last-appearance datum of Reinhardtites levis negate direct use of temperate zonation schemes for these sediments: the austral zonation is more effective but has lower stratigraphic resolution. The upper Campanian to Maestrichtian of Ninetyeast Ridge contains both austral and tropical forms in different horizons; the modified zonation of Sissingh (1977) is most effective in age-dating these sediments. The Turonian-Santonian calcareous nannofossil assemblages are relatively sparse and poorly preserved. The absence of diagnostic species in the Turonian-Santonian sections is due to poor preservation and the unfavorable paleoenvironment of the rapid deposition of the thick ash in this interval. Biostratigraphic resolution is significantly impaired in this interval...|$|R

Arthrotomy of the femorotibial joint was performed under aseptic conditions by an incision of the skin over the ligamentum patellae and an incision of the knee capsule. After dislocating the patella laterally, a chondral defect using a cordless screwdriver was drilled {{in the center of}} the trochlea. The defect was 4  mm in diameter, maximum 5  mm in depth and about 5  mm in the distance to the proximal trochlear <b>ridge.</b> Immediately after <b>drilling</b> the defect was rinsed with isotonic saline (0.9 %). Then the HA gel was pipetted into the defect and let to polymerize for 3  min. For the animals of group 3 the lyophilized 1.5 % hyaluronan thiomer matrix was placed into the chondral defect before it was filled up with HA gel. The defect of the untreated rabbits was rinsed before the knee capsule, and the skin region was sutured. The same closing procedure was performed in the treated rabbits. Aluminum Spray was used for wound closure. 30  min after surgery pain relief was reached by administrating Atipamezole (1.0  mg/kg b.w., i.m., Revertor®) to the animals.|$|R
40|$|Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 327 (summer 2010) was {{designed}} to resolve the nature of fluid-rock interactions in young, upper volcanic crust on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca <b>Ridge.</b> Expedition 327 <b>drilled,</b> cased and cored two new basement holes, conducted hydrogeologic experiments, and installed subseafloor borehole observatories (Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kits, CORKs). These CORKs were intended to allow borehole conditions to recover to a more natural state after the dissipation of disturbances caused by drilling, casing, and other operations; provide a long-term monitoring and sampling presence for determining fluid pressure, temperature, composition, and microbiology; and facilitate the completion of active experiments to resolve crustal hydrogeologic conditions and processes. Expedition 327 was followed (summer 2011) by R/V Atlantis Expedition AT 18 - 07, with the remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) Jason, to service these CORKs, collect subseafloor pressure data, recover and deploy autonomous fluid and microbial samplers, collect large volumes of borehole fluids, and initiate a cross-hole hydrogeologic experiment using an electromagnetic flow meter. In addition, Atlantis Expedition AT 18 - 07 refurbished an old CORK {{that could not be}} replaced during IODP Expedition 327, completing a critical part of the three-dimensional observation network that is currently being used to monitor a large-scale, directional formation response to long-term fluid flow from the crust. doi: 10. 2204 /iodp. sd. 13. 01. 2011 </a...|$|R
40|$|Strontium and {{neodymium}} {{radiogenic isotope}} ratios in early to middle Eocene fossil fish debris (ichthyoliths) from Lomonosov <b>Ridge</b> (Integrated Ocean <b>Drilling</b> Program Expedition 302) help constrain water mass compositions in the Eocene Arctic Ocean between 55 and 45 Ma. The inferred paleodepositional setting was a shallow, offshore marine to marginal marine environment with limited connections to surrounding ocean basins. The new data demonstrate that sources of Nd and Sr in fish debris were distinct from each other, {{consistent with a}} salinity-stratified water column above Lomonosov Ridge in the Eocene. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values of ichthyoliths (0. 7079 - 0. 7087) are more radiogenic than Eocene seawater, requiring brackish to fresh water conditions in the environment where fish metabolized Sr. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr variations probably record changes in the overall balance of river Sr flux to the Eocene Arctic Ocean between 55 and 45 Ma and are used here to reconstruct surface water salinity values. The eNd values of ichthyoliths vary between - 5. 7 and - 7. 8, compatible with periodic (or intermittent) supply of Nd to Eocene Arctic intermediate water (AIW) from adjacent seas. Although the Norwegian-Greenland Sea and North Atlantic Ocean were the most likely sources of Eocene AIW Nd, input from the Tethys Sea (via the Turgay Strait in early Eocene time) and the North Pacific Ocean (via a proto-Bering Strait) also contributed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring ODP Leg 209, a magma-starved {{area of the}} Mid-Atlantic <b>Ridge</b> (MAR) was <b>drilled</b> in the {{vicinity}} of the Fifteen-Twenty Fracture Zone (FZ) that offsets one of the slowest portions of the spreading ridge. We present here the results of a bulk rock multi-elemental study of 27 peridotites drilled at Sites 1272 and 1274 (to the south and the north of the FZ, respectively). The peridotites comprise mainly of harzburgites with minor dunites. Clinopyroxene (Cpx), which is interstitial and interpreted as secondary, is observed in Site 1274 peridotites. Sites 1272 and 1274 peridotites have low Al 2 O 3 contents (91. 5), and bulk rock trace elements compositions mostly below 0. 1 x primitive mantle (PM). These peridotites, and in particular Site 1272 peridotites, represent the most depleted peridotites yet sampled at a slow spreading ridge. Their compositions indicate high degrees of partial melting and melt extraction. A single open-system melting event (melting plus percolation of melts produced within upwelling mantle) can explain their highly depleted yet linear chondrite-normalized REE patterns, characterized by a steady depletion from HREE to LREE. Late melt-rock reactions and precipitation of Cpx explains the slightly less depleted compositions of Site 1274 peridotites. Hence, the differences in composition between Sites 1272 and 1274 peridotites do not provide evidence for regional variations in the degrees of partial melting from the south to the north of the FZ. The occurrence of highly refractory peridotites in the Fifteen-Twenty area suggests we sampled a more actively convecting mantle than generally supposed below slow spreading centers...|$|R
