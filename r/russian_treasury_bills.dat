40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of <b>treasury</b> <b>bills</b> in stimulating growth of the Zimbabwean economy. Literature on the effectiveness of <b>Treasury</b> <b>bills</b> asserts that <b>treasury</b> <b>bills</b> contribute to the growth of the economy. Interviews were held with the Ministry of Finance, Banks and Pension Funds as well as the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE). The researcher managed to interview eleven interviewees with all sectors of the economy being represented. Tables and content analysis were used to present data. The research found that the current status of <b>treasury</b> <b>bills</b> issuances in Zimbabwe is that most organisations are not participating in the market for securities. The Government issued <b>treasury</b> <b>bills</b> but their uptake has been very low. This is due to a number of factors which include too much debt in the market, insufficient capital, poor interbank trading, unavailability of collateral security for the lender-of-last- resort, as well as for the settlement systems such as ZimSwitch, RTGS and a poor cheque clearing system. <b>Treasury</b> <b>bills</b> were not found to be effective enough in Zimbabwe as money market instruments to mobilise funds for the government. They have not had a positive influence on the availability of liquidity in the Zimbabwean economy. The research recommends that <b>Treasury</b> <b>bills</b> should be affordable and attract an economically competitive benchmark value in the securities market. There should be a buy-back feature of TBs and there is need for more risk free instruments for money market borrowing. In order to stimulate growth of the Zimbabwean economy, the research recommends that the Government of Zimbabwe should continue with its cash budget approach and improve it. An area of further study is recommended to investigate the impact of dollarization on the performance of stock markets in Zimbabwe; in as far as they influence money supply and liquidity in the economy...|$|R

Also the advanced countries are discovered to use more <b>treasury</b> <b>bills</b> than central bank bills. It is also found that employment of two securities leads to bond market segmentation, profit deterioration of central bank, and increase of government debt. Based on these problems caused by using two bills simultaneously, I suggest that central bank bills should be integrated into <b>treasury</b> <b>bills</b> in those countries in which two bills are used at the same time. As for the integration, I recommend that maturity of two bills need to be adjusted before long, resulting in short- and long-term for treasury securities and mid-term for central bank bills...|$|R
