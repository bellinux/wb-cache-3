40|$|In this report, future {{performance}} {{demands of}} batteries for various vehicular applications are modeled. Vehicles {{ranging in size}} from electric bikes to heavy trucks are assessed using driving cycle data which allows key performance parameters such as desired <b>range</b> (<b>km),</b> specific energy of the battery (Wh/Kg), cycle life requirement and expected price per unit capacity (Euro/kWh) to be calculated. These projected performance requirements are compared with the outputs for three existing Li-ion batteries (namely (a) Kokam based high specific energy source (b) A 123 based high power energy source and (c) Winston low cost system). The theoretical, current state of the art and projected performance parameters for 'beyond Li-ion' technologies (Li-S and Li-O 2) are also compared to the modeled battery performance demands. The analysis indicates that current battery technologies are unlikely to meet future requirements in terms of required specific energies and will likely be too costly. In comparison, fully realized beyond Li-ion alternatives may deliver the required specific energy for the full range of vehicles examined. However, scale-up of these systems is a daunting challenge and their successful implementation will depend on improvements in terms of cycle life, electrode and electrolyte stability, rate performance and development of practical battery architectures.

The trypanosomatid enzyme exhibited a low Km value for dUTP (2. 11 μM), a kcat of 49 s− 1, strict Michaelis–Menten kinetics and is a potent catalyst of dUDP hydrolysis, whereas in other dUTPases described, this compound acts as a competitive inhibitor. Discrimination is achieved for the base and sugar moiety showing specificity constants for different dNTPs similar to those of bacterial, viral, and human enzymes. In the alkaline range, the Km for dUTP increases with the dissociation of ionizable groups showing pKa values of 8. 8, identified as the uracil moiety of dUTP and 10, whereas in the acidic <b>range,</b> <b>Km</b> is regulated by an enzyme residue exhibiting a pKa of 7. 1. Activity is strongly inhibited by the nucleoside triphosphate analog α-β-imido-dUTP, indicating that the enzyme can bind triphosphate analogs.

40|$|During their {{passage through}} the {{atmosphere}} meteoroids produce a hypersonic shock which may be recorded at {{the ground in the}} form of infrasound. The first objective of this project was to use global infrasound measurements to estimate the influx of large (meter/decameter) objects to Earth and investigate which parameters of their ablation and disruption can be determined using infrasound records. A second objective was to evaluate and extend existing cylindrical line source blast theory for meteoroids by combining new observations with earlier analytical models, and validate these against centimetre-sized optical meteor observations. The annual terrestrial influx of large meteoroids (kinetic energies above a threshold E) was found to be N= 4. 5 E– 0. 6 where E is expressed in kilotons of TNT equivalent. This indicates that estimates of the influx derived from telescopic surveys of small asteroids near Earth are too low. Infrasound records from an event over Indonesia in 2009 were used to develop a technique to estimate the altitude of meteoroid terminal bursts and their energies. The burst altitude in this case was determined to be near 20 kilometers and the energy between 8 – 67 kilotons of TNT equivalent. Using a network of optical cameras and an Infrasound Array in southern Ontario, Canada, 71 centimetre-sized meteoroids were optically detected and associated with infrasonic signals recorded at the ground. The shock source height and its uncertainty along the meteor trail from raytracing was determined including wind effects due to gravity waves perturbations, which were found to be significant for such short <b>range</b> (<b>km)</b> infrasound propagation.

40|$|In {{an ongoing}} {{programme}} to develop characterization strategies relevant to biosensors for in-vivo monitoring, glucose biosensors were fabricated by immobilizing the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) on 125 µm diameter Pt cylinder wire electrodes (PtC), using three different methods: before, after {{or during the}} amperometric electrosynthesis of poly(ortho-phenylenediamine), PoPD, which {{also served as a}} permselective membrane. These electrodes were calibrated with H 2 O 2 (the biosensor enzyme signal molecule), glucose, and the archetypal interference compound ascorbic acid (AA) to determine the relevant polymer permeabilities and the apparent Michaelis-Menten parameters for glucose. A number of selectivity parameters were used to identify the most successful design in terms of the balance between substrate sensitivity and interference blocking. For biosensors electrosynthesized in neutral buffer under the present conditions, entrapment of the GOx within the PoPD layer produced the design (PtC/PoPD-GOx) with the highest linear sensitivity to glucose (5. 0 ± 0. 4 μA cm− 2 mM− 1), good linear <b>range</b> (<b>KM</b> = 16 ± 2 mM) and response time (< 2 s), and the greatest AA blocking (99. 8 % for 1 mM AA). Further optimization showed that fabrication of PtC/PoPD-GOx in the absence of added background electrolyte (i. e., electropolymerization in unbuffered enzyme-monomer solution) enhanced glucose selectivity 3 -fold for this one-pot fabrication protocol which provided AA-rejection levels at least equal to recent multi-step polymer bilayer biosensor designs. Interestingly, the presence of enzyme protein in the polymer layer had opposite effects on permselectivity for low and high concentrations of AA, emphasizing the value of studying the concentration dependence of interference effects which is rarely reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{reversible}} {{reaction of}} GSH with two dietary anticarcinogens, benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) and phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), {{has been studied}} in the absence and presence of human glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). The spontaneous reaction at pH 7. 4 and 37 degrees C yielded values for k 2 of 17. 9 and 6. 0 M- 1. s- 1 for GSH conjugation of BITC and PEITC respectively (forward reaction), and k 1 values of 6. 9 x 10 (- 4) and 2. 4 x 10 (- 4) s- 1 for dissociation of the respective GSH conjugates, BITC-SG and PEITC-SG (reverse reaction). GSTs A 1 - 1, A 2 - 2, M 1 a- 1 a and P 1 - 1 catalysed both the forward and reverse reactions with specific activities (mumol/min per mg at 30 microM isothiocyanate or GSH conjugate) ranging from 23. 1 for the GSH conjugation of BITC by GST P 1 - 1 to 0. 03 for the dissociation of BITC-SG by GST A 1 - 1. When present at similar concentration to substrates (12 microM), GSTs A 1 - 1 and A 2 - 2 but not GST M 1 a- 1 a shifted the equilibrium in favour of BITC-SG or PEITC-SG. Kinetic studies confirmed that GST A 1 - 1 interacted selectively with the GSH conjugates in the micromolar <b>range</b> (<b>Km</b> 6. 9 microM, Ki 4. 3 microM), whereas GST M 1 a- 1 a interacted with BITC-SG and PEITC-SG with approx. 5 -fold lower affinity.

40|$|Glucocorticoids inXuence the {{function}} of numerous tissues. Although there are {{a very large number}} of studies that have investigated the local metabolism of glucocorticoids in mammals, the knowledge of this metabolism in birds is limited. The local concentration of cor-ticosterone is critical for both glucocorticoid- and mineralocorticoid-dependent activity, and we have therefore carried out studies of cor-ticosterone metabolism in various chicken organs. It was found that corticosterone was metabolized to 20 -dihydrocorticosterone, and in some tissues also to 11 -dehydrocorticosterone and 11 -dehydro- 20 -dihydrocorticosterone. The activity of 20 -hydroxysteroid dehydroge-nase (20 HSD), responsible for the transformation of corticosterone to 20 -hydroxy derivatives, was abundant in the kidney and intestine, with lower levels in the liver and testis. Low levels of 20 HSD were detected in the brain and ovaries. In contrast, 11 -hydroxysteroid dehy-drogenase (11 HSD) activity was only found in the kidney and intestine. No activity was observed in the brain, testis, or ovaries. The treat-ment of chickens with estrogens stimulated 20 HSD activity in the kidney, intestine, and oviduct and 11 HSD activity in the liver and oviduct. Kinetic studies for corticosterone yielded an apparent Km for 11 HSD in the nanomolar (Km D 21 § 5 nmol · l¡ 1) and for 20 HSD in the micromolar <b>range</b> (<b>Km</b> D 3. 7 § 0. 3 mol · l¡ 1).

40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) and interferometric SAR (InSAR) {{measurements are}} {{disturbed by the}} propagation velocity changes of microwaves that are caused by the high density of free electrons in the ionosphere. Most affected are low-frequency (L- or P-band) radars although higher frequency (C- or X-band) systems, as the recently launched Sentinel- 1, are not immune. Since the ionosphere is an obstacle to increasing the precision of SAR systems needed to remotely measure the Earth’s dynamic processes, as ground deformation, {{it is necessary to}} estimate and compensate ionospheric propagation delays in SAR signals. In this work we work discuss about the influence of the ionosphere on interferograms and the possible correction methods. The ionospheric error, when measuring ground motion with C-band InSAR systems, is often considered small enough to be ignored. In this work we assess the average ionospheric error level occurring in non-compensated interferograms by using global ionospheric measurements, to show that the correction of ionospheric effects can sensibly increase the measurement accuracy. A statistical analysis of IGS global ionospheric TEC maps is used to calculate the standard deviation of the LOS and along-track error caused by ionospheric effects. IGS global TEC maps are generated assimilating a network of GPS-based TEC measurements with ionospheric models. The resolution and accuracy of these maps are too low to allow the correction of interferograms. Nevertheless, we use them for the statistical analysis to obtain a reasonable assessment of the possible ionospheric error when no correction is applied to interferograms. Firstly, we produce a histogram of the differential ionospheric TEC level considering all possible 12 -days interferograms of one year (2015). In fact, a different absolute ionospheric level during the two acquisitions generates a linear phase term in the interferogram range direction due to the incidence angle change. This additional phase term introduces a measurement error. A global map of the expected LOS error can then be produced; an example is reported in Figure 1. Such a map can be used to predict the ionospheric error to ground deformation measurements. Solar cycle, diurnal, seasonal, and geographical variations of the ionosphere influence the error level for different satellites with different orbits, acquisition times, and for different geographical regions. For example, the result shows how the standard deviation of the LOS deformation error for a single Sentinel- 1 interferogram in ascending geometry is, in low latitude regions, about 4 cm every 100 ground <b>range</b> <b>km.</b> The latter considers only the effect due to the incidence angle change; a similar analysis has been also realized for the ionospheric gradients in the range and azimuth directions. The analysis indicates that the ionosphere can sensibly reduce the accuracy of ground deformation measurements. To increase such accuracy, the split-spectrum method can be used to estimate and remove the ionospheric phase screen from interferograms. In {{the second part of the}} work, the processing workflow of the split-spectrum method, applied to the special case of TOPS images, will be presented. Practical examples of successful correction of ionospheric disturbances, as well as possible issues, will also be presented. Figure 2 shows a disturbed interferogram and its compensated version. The phase screens estimated with the split-spectrum method will then be compared to the ones derived from the global TEC maps, to verify the quality of the statistical analysis. Finally, other ionospheric effects on Sentinel- 1 interferograms, such as ionosphere-induced azimuth shifts will also be discussed with some examples, and possible correction strategies proposed...|$|E
