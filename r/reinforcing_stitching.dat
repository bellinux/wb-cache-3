40|$|Conference paperThis paper {{presents}} a scheme developed for instrumentation and {{monitoring of the}} structural performance of aÂ hybrid precast and in situ concrete flat slab system employed in an educational building. The system contains a precast plateÂ flooring slab, which is composed of a thin reinforced concrete plate incorporating a steel lattice girder and all reinforcementÂ required by design. A top mat of reinforcement is placed on site, as well as <b>reinforcing</b> <b>stitching</b> bars across the precast slabÂ joints to ensure shear transfer and two way bending action. The concrete topping is then placed on site. Preliminary dataÂ obtained from the instrumented building are discussed. Continuous monitoring of the data will allow long term effects, such asÂ creep, to also be monitored and compared with design guidelines...|$|E
2500|$|Swimwear: Male {{water polo}} players wear either swim briefs or jammers (thigh-length trunks). Female players must wear a {{one-piece}} swimsuit. [...] Suit-grabbing fouls are common, so players often wear tight-fitting suits, and may layer on several suits {{at a time}} for additional security. Many swimwear labels also sell specialized water polo suits that feature <b>reinforced</b> <b>stitching</b> and tougher fabric. [...] Female water polo suits are generally one-piece outfits which do not have open backs, but zip securely up the back so as to not have straps {{that can be easily}} grabbed.|$|R
50|$|When webbing is sewn or tied {{together}} at the ends, it becomes a sling or runner, and if you clip a carabiner to {{each end of the}} sling, you have a quickdraw. These loops are made one of two ways—sewn (using <b>reinforced</b> <b>stitching)</b> or tied. Both ways of forming runners have advantages and drawbacks, and it is for the individual climber to choose which to use. Generally speaking, most climbers carry a few of both types. It is also important to note that only nylon can be safely knotted into a runner (usually using a water knot or beer knot), Dyneema is always sewn because the fibers are too slippery to hold a knot under weight.|$|R
50|$|A karategi is {{somewhat}} {{similar to a}} judogi (柔道着 or 柔道衣, Judo uniform) as it shares a common origin; however, the material and cut of the uniform is generally much lighter and looser fitting. The heaviest of Karategi are only 16 oz compared to some judogi at 35 oz. Because {{of the nature of}} Karate training which emphasizes striking, kicking and a more limited range of standing throws compared to Judo the karategi has evolved in a manner that maximizes mobility and speed without the extremely coarse and strong fabric required for grappling and throwing found in Judo. They are made from smooth cotton which may be brushed or ribbed for unrestricted movement and added comfort. <b>Reinforced</b> <b>stitching</b> is common, as to compensate for the stresses put on the gi.|$|R
25|$|For most pointe shoes, {{the sole}} is {{constructed}} from {{a piece of}} leather that {{is attached to the}} shoe with adhesive and <b>reinforced</b> by <b>stitching</b> along its edges. The sole overlaps and secures the unfinished edges of the shoe's exterior fabric. Pointe shoes may be manufactured with either scraped soles, which provide superior traction, or buffed soles, which have a smoother surface for reduced traction.|$|R
50|$|In his tailor shop, Davis made {{functional}} {{items such}} as tents, horse blankets and wagon covers for the railway workers on the Central Pacific Railroad. The fabric Davis worked with was heavy-duty cotton duck cloth and cotton denim which he bought from Levi Strauss & Co., a dry goods company in San Francisco. To strengthen the stress points of the sewn items he was making, Davis used copper rivets to <b>reinforce</b> the <b>stitching.</b>|$|R
50|$|A zigzag stitch is variant {{geometry}} of the lockstitch. It is a back-and-forth stitch used where a straight stitch will not suffice, such as in <b>reinforcing</b> buttonholes, in <b>stitching</b> stretchable fabrics, and in temporarily joining two work pieces edge-to-edge.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Advances in video-assisted {{thoracic}} surgical (VATS) technique led {{the authors}} {{to reconsider the}} treatment and thoracoscopic management of patients with giant bullous emphysema (GBE). Methods: From January 1993 to December 2001 we treated 40 patients with unilateral GBE: 24 males and 16 females, mean age 51 ^ 1 years. Thirty patients presented respiratory insufficiency, seven patients a spontaneous pneumothorax and three patients a bullae infection. Excision was performed by using Nd:YAG laser in five patients (12. 5 %) and stapling device in 35 patients (87. 5 %). Among the last 35, in 20 patients a partial pleurectomy stripping up to the 5 th intercostal space was associated. In 15 patients this technique was modified through the systematic application of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to <b>reinforce</b> <b>stitches.</b> Results: We experienced one conversion to open thoracotomy owing to haemorrhaging, in one patient who underwent a partial pleurectomy stripping. In the stapler resection patients, with PTFE application, the mean duration of air leaks, for type 1 bullae of Wakabayashi was 2. 2 ^ 1. 8 days and, for type 4, 5. 9 ^ 1. 4 days; the mean length of hospital stay was 6. 1 ^ 0. 5 days. Conclusions: The resection in VATS of giant bullous emphysema by stapling device associated to reinforcement in PTFE reduces duration of air leaks an...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{types of}} sweaters are {{traditionally}} knit in the round. Planned openings (arm holes, necks, cardigan fronts) are temporarily knitted with extra <b>stitches,</b> <b>reinforced</b> if necessary. Then the extra stitches are cut {{to create the}} opening, and are stitched with a sewing machine to prevent unraveling. [...] This technique is called steeking.|$|R

50|$|Most MMA fighters used {{specialized}} compression shirts, called Rash guards, to train. Rash {{guards are}} not regular compression shirts. Ground training techniques have required that these shirts provide <b>reinforced</b> seams and <b>stitching,</b> with additional panels {{to support the}} additional stress placed on the shirt during training while continuing to provide the benefits provided by regular compression shirts.|$|R
25|$|The {{purpose of}} 18th century stays was {{to support the}} bust and confer the fashionable conical shape while drawing the {{shoulders}} back. At this time, the eyelets were <b>reinforced</b> with <b>stitches</b> and were not placed across from one another, but instead staggered. This allowed the stays to be spiral laced. One end of the stay lace was inserted and knotted in the bottom eyelet; the other end was wound through the stays' eyelets and tightened on the top. Tight-lacing was not the purpose of stays during this time period. Women in all societal levels, from ladies of the court to street vendors, wore stays.|$|R
500|$|Little {{physical}} evidence survives {{to reconstruct the}} early development of English embroidery before the Norman Conquest of 1066. [...] <b>Stitches</b> <b>reinforcing</b> the seams of a garment in the Sutton Hoo ship burial may have been intended as decoration, and so be classed as embroidery, and fragments of a scrolling border worked in stem stitch were recovered from a grave in Kempston, Bedfordshire. [...] Some embroidered pieces of about 850 preserved in Maaseik, Belgium, are generally assumed to be Anglo-Saxon work based on their similarity to contemporary manuscript illustrations and sculptures of animals and interlace.|$|R
50|$|The process used to tailor, patch, mend and {{reinforce}} cloth fostered {{the development of}} sewing techniques, and the decorative possibilities of sewing led {{to the art of}} embroidery.Indeed, the remarkable stability of basic embroidery stitches has been noted:The art of embroidery has been found world-wide and several early examples have been found. Works in China have been dated to the Warring States period (5th-3rd century BC). In a garment from Migration period Sweden, roughly 300-700 AD, the edges of bands of trimming are <b>reinforced</b> with running <b>stitch,</b> back stitch, stem stitch, tailor's buttonhole stitch, and whip-stitching, but it is uncertain whether this work simply reinforced the seams or should be interpreted as decorative embroidery.|$|R
40|$|Polymeric {{composites}} {{that are}} <b>stitched</b> <b>reinforced</b> show dissimilar behaviours {{with respect to}} regular ones. In this paper the mechanical characteristics and different behaviours of <b>stitched</b> <b>reinforced</b> polymeric composites after impact tests are investigated using an alternative approach. Several factors such as grid size, stitching scheme and voids content modify the composite performances and the interlaminar delaminating processes. If, on the one hand, the stitching technique is used to prevent delaminating damage phenomena, then, on the other hand, the process itself introduces a sort of damage into the layers during the assembled preform, {{that has to be}} taken into account. Delaminating processes due to impact loads are considered and the post-impact behaviours and damage tolerance are investigated. Impact tests were performed at several energy levels known to have an appreciable damage on the specimens. Damage evaluation analysis was performed on post-impacted specimens using different techniques: as a first step, using a digitalised image technique, the damaged area was measured and different zone shape was evaluated, further compression tests were done to evaluate the material residual properties after impact. The results coming from compression tests do not reveal the better awaited behaviour of the stitched composites with respect to regular ones. On the other hand, the acoustic emission technique is capable of evidencing the different aspects of the stitching wire. The image acquisition technique represents a new experimental method able to fully characterise damage zones and gives more information on the interlaminar behaviour of composite material. This new technique joined to acoustic emission measurements allows important results on the residual life prediction of materials mechanical properties to be obtained...|$|R
40|$|Heavily patched and mended boro {{garments}} from Japan characterize extreme {{methods of}} frugality employed to sustain garments over lifetimes. Indigenous Japanese otsuzure (workwear) were examined {{for clues to}} efficient material usage, aesthetics of wear, and methods of reuse that may be applied to sustainable contemporary apparel. Principles of wabi-sabi guided the composition of rustic, slightly damaged materials into seemingly simple garment shapes. They integrate clean structures with adaptable fit, plus a collar and pockets. Sashiko <b>stitches</b> <b>reinforce</b> fragile areas. The minimal form of the top is uncontrived; a natural reflection of a solitary rectangle of cloth cut to eliminate all waste while balancing perfectly from the shoulders. The cut of the mompe, led to improved material efficiency and fit, and an unusual pocket composition. A blend of hand and machine technologies integrates function and craft into wearable garments that transcend fast fashion trendsâ€”and contribute alternative methods to patternmaking and pocket design...|$|R

Authors report a case of stab wound by screwdriver, treated at cardiovascular center in Dakar. This is a 16 -year-old boy who experienced physical aggression. He was assaulted with a screwdriver and had stab wound on the anterior wall of the chest. Physical examination showed a screwdriver penetrating the sternum bone over a right angle. He had a mild pericardial blood effusion and a right ventricle wound 5 [*]mm in diameter with transection of the right coronary vein.

40|$|A simple {{model is}} {{proposed}} for predicting the fatigue life of three-dimensional (3 D) fiber-polymer composite materials for certain cyclic load conditions. The fatigue life call be easily calculated using the model with three empirically determined constants: (i) the ultimate {{strength of the}} 3 D composite, (ii) the ultimate strength of the two-dimensional (2 D) laminate, which is identical in every respect to the 3 D composite (e. g., same fiber layup pattern, fiber volume content) except for the through-thickness reinforcement, and (iii) the slope parameter (m) of tile fatigue-life (S-logN) curve for the 2 D laminate. It is shown that the S-log N curves for stitched composites under cyclic tension-tension and compression-compression loading and for z-pinned composites under cyclic bending loading can be accurately predicted using this model. This model call also approximate the tensile fatigue life of composite lap joints <b>reinforced</b> by <b>stitches</b> or z-pills. However, the model is not reliable in predicting the fatigue life of 3 D composites in all cases. It is only accurate when the fatigue damage mechanisms and failure mode of tile 3 D composite are not altered significantly by the through-thickness reinforcement. Consequently, a limitation of the model is that a priori knowledge of the fatigue damage process of the 3 D composite is needed {{before it can be}} used with confidence to predict fatigue life. This problem is exasperated by the paucity of information available on the fatigue mechanisms of many types of 3 D composites. Until this problem is resolved, tile model should only be applied to those types of 3 D composites in which their fatigue processes have been determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} to low velocity impact loadings, which may occur during manufacturing, service and maintenance, {{is a key}} factor in the design of composite material structures. Many techniques, ranging from the adoption of tough matrices/high-strain fibers to the introduction of through-thickness reinforcement, have been proposed to improve the damage response of composite laminates subject to impact. The insertion of transverse <b>reinforcing</b> threads by <b>stitching,</b> in particular, appears very promising to restrict damage growth and to improve post-impact performance of laminates. In order to develop general models capable of addressing the issues of damage tolerance and resistance, detailed understanding of {{the nature and extent of}} damage, identification of the dominant fracture modes and assessment of the effect of stitches on the damage development are essential. In this study instrumented drop-weight tests were carried out to examine and compare the damage response of stitched and unstitched cross-ply graphite/epoxy laminates subject to low-velocity impact. The progression of damage and its relationship with impact and absorbed energy were investigated by means of an extensive series of damage observations, conducted with various techniques (X-radiography, ultrasonics, optical microscopy, deply) ...|$|R
40|$|Stitch fiber {{comparison}} {{for improvement}} of interlaminar fracture toughness in stitched composites KT Tan 1, N Watanabe 1 and Y Iwahori 2 In this study, strain energy release rates are measured and compared for laminated composites <b>reinforced</b> by through-thickness <b>stitching</b> using different stitch fiber materials – Carbon, Kevlar, and Vectran. Strain energy release rates are evaluated experimentally using the DCB test and validated computationally using FEA. The FE model of the stitched composite incorporates a novel four-step stitch fracture process, namely: interfacial debonding, slack absorption, fiber breakage, and pull-out friction. The FE predictions of GIC show good agreement with the experimental results. It is revealed {{that the relationship between}} GIC and stitch density, or stitch thread volume fraction for all stitch materials follow a linear law. It is concluded that Vectran provides the toughest interlaminar reinforcement and is most suitable for stitch fiber application. The characterization and difference in fracture behavior between Vectran and Kevlar stitch fibers, by using a novel Interlaminar Tension Test (ITT), are presented and discussed...|$|R
