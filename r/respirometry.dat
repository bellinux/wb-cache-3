25|$|Tubing and {{connections}} : Various kinds of tubing {{can be used}} to connect the components of the <b>respirometry</b> system to and from the animal chamber. A variety of kinds of flexible tubing may be used, depending on the characteristics of the system. Acetyl, Bev-A-Line, Kynar, nylon, Tygon tubing and connectors may be used in regions of the system where oxidizing atmospheres are low (e.g., background levels of ozone only); Teflon tubing would be recommended if there is an expectation for appreciable amounts of ozone to be present because it is inert to ozone. Teflon tubes are more costly and lack flexibility.|$|E
25|$|Mass flow meters: The {{equations}} {{required for}} calculating rates of oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide production {{assume that the}} flow rates {{into and out of}} the chambers are known exactly. We use mass flow meters which have the advantage of yielding flow rates independent of temperature and air pressure. Therefore, these flow rates can be considered to be corrected to standard conditions (Standard Temperature Pressure). We only measure and control flow at one location—downstream from the chamber. Therefore, we must assume that the inflow and outflow rates are identical. However, during construction of the <b>respirometry</b> system, flow rate must be measured at all steps, across all connections, to verify integrity of flow.|$|E
25|$|Acrylic {{flow meters}} : Under some {{circumstances}} of high flow rates we may use simple acrylic flow meters (0-2.5liters/min) {{to control the}} flow rates through the metabolic chambers. The meters are located upstream from the metabolic chambers. The flow meters are simple to use but should be calibrated twice daily {{for use in the}} <b>respirometry</b> system: once before recording begins (but after the animal has been sealed inside the chamber!!) and again {{at the end of the}} recording (before the animal is removed from the chamber). Calibration must be done with a bubble flow meter because the calibration marks on the acrylic meters are only approximate. For proper calibration of flow rates remember that both barometric pressure and temperature of the air streaming through the flow meter (which we assume to be equal to room temperature) must be recorded.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, a {{computer}} data acquisition and control {{system would be}} a typical addition to complete the system.

[...] A variety of companies and individuals service the <b>respirometry</b> community (e.g., Sable Systems, Qubit Systems, see also Warthog Systems).|$|E
2500|$|Needle valves: Mass {{flow meters}} may be {{purchased}} with mass flow controllers which permit setting flow rates. [...] These are expensive, however. <b>Respirometry</b> research often {{will attempt to}} measure more than one animal at a time, which would necessitate one chamber per animal and thus controlled flow through each chamber. [...] An alternative and more cost-effective method to control flow would be via stainless steel or carbon steel needle valves. Needle valves plus mass flow meters provides a cost-effective means to achieve desired flow rates. The valves cost about $20.|$|E
2500|$|Oxygen analyzer: Oxygen analyzers {{suitable}} for <b>respirometry</b> {{use a variety}} of oxygen sensors, including galvanic ("ambient temperature"), paramagnetic, polarographic (Clark-type electrodes), and zirconium ("high temperature") sensors. [...] Galvanic O2 analyzers use a fuel cell containing an acidic electrolyte, a heavy-metal anode and a thin gas-permeable membrane. Since the partial pressure of O2 near the anode is zero, O2 is driven by diffusion to the anode via the membrane at a rate proportional to ambient O2 partial pressure. The fuel cell produces a voltage linearly proportional to the O2 partial pressure at the membrane. As long as cabinet temperature is stable, and provided that air flow across the fuel cell is stable and within range, the response will be 0.01% or better depending on supporting electronics, software, and other considerations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{metabolism}} of {{an animal}} is estimated by determining rates of carbon dioxide production (VCO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) of individual animals, either in a closed or an open-circuit <b>respirometry</b> system. [...] Two measures are typically obtained: standard (SMR) or basal metabolic rate (BMR) and maximal rate (VO2max). [...] SMR is measured while the animal is at rest (but not asleep) under specific laboratory (temperature, hydration) and subject-specific conditions (e.g., size or allometry), age, reproduction status, post-absorptive to avoid thermic effect of food). VO2max is typically determined during aerobic exercise at or near physiological limits. In contrast, field metabolic rate (FMR) refers to the metabolic rate of an unrestrained, active animal in nature. [...] Whole-animal metabolic rates refer to these measures without correction for body mass. [...] If SMR or BMR values are divided by the body mass value for the animal, then the rate is termed mass-specific. [...] It is this mass-specific value that one typically hears in comparisons among species.|$|E
2500|$|The usual {{equipment}} {{includes a}} seal-able metabolic chamber, an oxygen sensor, and devices for data recording, stirring, thermostatisation {{and a way}} to introduce chemicals into the chamber. As described above for whole-animal <b>respirometry</b> the choice of materials is very important. Plastic materials are not suitable for the chamber because of their oxygen storage capacity. When plastic materials are unavoidable (e.g. for o-rings, coatings of stirrers, or stoppers) polymers with a very low oxygen permeability (like PVDF as opposed to e.g. PTFE) may be used. Remaining oxygen diffusion into or out of the chamber materials can be handled by correcting the measured oxygen fluxes for the instrumental oxygen background flux. The entire instrument comprising the mentioned components is often called an oxygraph. The companies providing equipment for whole-animal rspirometry mentioned above are usually not involved in mitochondrial respiromety. The community is serviced at widely varying levels of price and sophistication by companies like Oroboros Instruments, Hansatech, Respirometer Systems & Applications, YSI Life Sciences or Strathkelvin Instruments [...]|$|E
2500|$|<b>Respirometry</b> {{depends on}} a [...] "what goes in must come out" [...] principle. Consider a closed system first. Imagine that we place a mouse into an {{air-tight}} container. The air sealed in the container initially contains the same composition and proportions of gases that {{were present in the}} room: 20.95% O2, 0.04% CO2, water vapor (the exact amount {{depends on a}}ir temperature, see dew point), 78% (approximately) N2, 0.93% argon and a variety of trace gases making up the rest (see Earth's atmosphere). As time passes, the mouse in the chamber produces CO2 and water vapor, but extracts O2 from the air in proportion to its metabolic demands. Therefore, as long as we know the volume of the system, the difference between the concentrations of O2 and CO2 at the start when we sealed the mouse into the chamber (the baseline or reference conditions) compared to the amounts present after the mouse has breathed the air at a later time must be the amounts of CO2/O2 produced/consumed by the mouse. Nitrogen and argon are inert gasses and therefore their fractional amounts are unchanged by the respiration of the mouse. In a closed system, the environment will eventually become hypoxic.|$|E
2500|$|Metabolic chambers: Chambers may be {{glass jars}} with rubber {{stoppers}} for lids; syringe barrels for small animals and insects; or constructed from Plexiglas. Ideally, chambers should be constructed from inert materials; for example, the acrylic plastics can absorb O2 {{and may be}} a poor choice for <b>respirometry</b> with very small insects. Chambers need to be constructed {{in a manner that}} yields rapid mixing of gases within the chamber. [...] The simplest metabolic chamber for a small vertebrate might be a glass jar with a stopper. [...] The stoppers are fitted with two ports: short extensions of Teflon tubing are provided for line connections. Teflon tube extensions are pushed through the bulkhead and the line connection is finished by attaching a small hose clip {{to the base of the}} Teflon tube extension. Additionally, an extension to the inlet port inside the jar should be provided—this ensures that the animal's expiratory gases are not washed away by the in flow stream. The animal is sealed inside and the rubber stopper is held in place with Velcro straps. If an upstream system is used, any metabolic chamber leak will result in loss of animal air and, therefore, an underestimate of the animal's metabolic rate. When you close an animal inside a metabolic chamber, attention must be paid to the seal. To ensure tight seals before closing the lid, firmly work the stopper into the jar and make sure that it is even. Use 1-2 straps (2 are better) and pull tightly. Acrylic (Plexiglas) chambers will be constructed for some uses, but precise engineering will be needed to ensure proper seating; gaskets will help, and judicious use of tight-fitting clamps will minimize leaks.|$|E

Three different types of samples may be subjected to such respirometric studies:isolated mitochondria (from cell cultures, animals or plants); permeabilized cells (from cell cultures); and permeabilized fibers or tissues (from animals). In the latter two cases the cellular membrane is made permeable {{by the addition of}} chemicals leaving selectively the mitochondrial membrane intact. Therefore, chemicals that usually {{would not be able to}} cross the cell membrane can directly influence the mitochondria. By the permeabilization of the cellular membrane, the cell stops to exist as a living, defined organism, leaving only the mitochondria as still functional structures.Unlike whole-animal <b>respirometry,</b> mitochondrial <b>respirometry</b> takes place in solution, i.e. the sample is suspended in a medium.

50|$|A respirometer is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} the rate of {{respiration}} of a living organism by measuring its rate of exchange of oxygen and/or carbon dioxide. They allow investigation into how factors such as age, or chemicals affect the rate of respiration.

These fields are covered by whole animal and cellular (or mitochondrial) <b>respirometry,</b> respectively.|$|E
50|$|Biodegradability can be {{measured}} in a number of ways. <b>Respirometry</b> tests can be used for aerobic microbes. First one places a solid waste sample in a container with microorganisms and soil, and then aerate the mixture. Over the course of several days, microorganisms digest the sample bit by bit and produce carbon dioxide - the resulting amount of CO2 serves as an indicator of degradation. Biodegradability can also {{be measured}} by anaerobic microbes and the amount of methane or alloy that they are able to produce. In formal scientific literature, the process is termed bio-remediation.|$|E
50|$|Indirect {{calorimetry}} is {{the study}} or clinical use {{of the relationship between}} <b>respirometry</b> and bioenergetics, where the measurement of the rates of change in oxygen consumption, sometimes carbon dioxide production, and less often urea production is transformed to energy expenditure and expressed as the ratio between i) energy and ii) the time frame of the measurement. For example, following analysis of oxygen consumption of a human subject, if 5.5 kilocalories of energy were estimated during a 5-minute measurement from a rested individual, then the resting metabolic rate equals = 1.1 kcal/min rate.|$|E
50|$|Swimming and {{physiological}} behaviours change {{in response to}} fluctuations in water temperature. <b>Respirometry</b> experiments show that heart rates of Atlantic cod change drastically with changes in temperature {{of only a few}} degrees. A rise in water temperature causes marked increases in cod swimming activity. Cod typically avoid new temperature conditions, and the temperatures can dictate where they are distributed in water. They prefer to be deeper, in colder water layers during the day, and in shallower, warmer water layers at night. These fine-tuned behavioural changes to water temperature are driven by an effort to maintain homeostasis to preserve energy. This is demonstrated by the fact that a change of only 2.5 °C caused a highly costly increase in metabolic rate of 15 to 30%.|$|E

40|$|Metabolic {{rates of}} aquatic organisms are {{estimated}} from measurements of oxygen consumption rates (Mo 2) through swimming and resting <b>respirometry.</b> These distinct approaches are increasingly used in ecophysiology and conservation physiology studies; however, {{few studies have}} tested whether they yield comparable results. We examined whether two fundamental Mo 2 measures, standard metabolic rate (SMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR), vary based on the method employed. Ten bridled monocle bream (Scolopsis bilineata) were exercised using (1) a critical swimming speed (Ucrit) protocol, (2) a 15 min exhaustive chase protocol and (3) a 3 min exhaustive chase protocol followed by brief (1 min) air exposure. Protocol 1 was performed in a swimming respirometer whereas protocols 2 and 3 were followed by resting <b>respirometry.</b> SMR estimates in swimming <b>respirometry</b> {{were similar to those}} in resting <b>respirometry</b> when a three-parameter exponential or power function was used to extrapolate the swimming speed–Mo 2 relationship to zero swimming speed. In contrast, MMR using the Ucrit protocol was 36 % higher than MMR derived from the 15 min chase protocol and 23 % higher than MMR using the 3 min chase/ 1 min air exposure protocol. For strong steady (endurance) swimmers, such as S. bilineata, swimming <b>respirometry</b> can produce more accurate MMR estimates than exhaustive chase protocols because oxygen consumption is measured during exertion. However, when swimming <b>respirometry</b> is impractical, exhaustive chase protocols should be supplemented with brief air exposure to improve measurement accuracy.

40|$|Studies on {{metabolism}} usually rely on {{measurements of}} oxygen consumption obtained in <b>respirometry</b> chambers. Despite rigorous standardization {{there is still}} considerable interindividual variation in metabolic rates which is often ignored. Furthermore, housing in <b>respirometry</b> chambers implies handling and exposure to a new environment, conditions {{known to be a}} source of stress in animals. The extent of stress response is known to be dependent on an individual’s coping style. Therefore, the extent of individual variation in <b>respirometry</b> data may be related to the expression of coping styles. The goal of this study is to determine whether the variation in oxygen consumption after a stressor is the resultant of an individual’s coping style. Our approach was to determine oxygen consumption in fish immediately after transfer to respiratory chambers and during the subsequent 22 h. In addition, the same individuals were subjected to 3 <b>respirometry</b> runs (22 h each) to address the question whether habituation occurs when fish are used in multiple runs and whether habituation potential is linked to coping styles. The same individuals were then subjected to an acute stressor and the escape behaviour and plasma cortisol were determined to assess coping style. Taken as a whole, the findings of this study suggest that individual variation in oxygen consumption in <b>respirometry</b> chambers are related to the expression of coping styles: individuals with higher oxygen consumption at the start and throughout the measurement period were shown to react passively (longer latency to escape) in a confinement stress. In addition, successive <b>respirometry</b> runs should not be assumed to result in habituation, as depending on an individual’s coping style either habituation (in the case of passive copers) or sensitization (in the case of active copers) can occur...|$|E
40|$|Closed-system <b>respirometry</b> is a {{standard}} technique used to determine aerobic metabolism of aquatic organisms. Open-top systems are rarely used due to concerns of gas exchange across the air–water interface. Here, we evaluated an open-top <b>respirometry</b> system by comparing the mass-specific routine metabolic rate (RMR) of the tropical diadromous finfish barramundi, Lates calcarifer, in both closed-top and open-top respirometers. The RMR of 190 g barramundi was determined across broad temperatures ranging from 18 to 38 ° C. There {{was no significant difference}} in RMR between barramundi in either closed- or open-top respirometers at any temperature (p> 0. 05). To ensure RMR measurements were not an artifact of the <b>respirometry</b> system, barramundi were reciprocally transplanted into either respective closed-top or open-top respirometer and oxygen consumption re-measured at each temperature treatment. The RMR of transplanted barramundi was found to be virtually identical in either respirometer. RMR increased linearly with increasing temperature; the relationship between RMR and temperature (T; 18 – 38 °C) can be described as 3. 658 T− 36. 294 mg O 2 kg - 0. 8 h− 1. The daily energetic cost of RMR was 1. 193 T− 11. 838 kJ kg− 0. 8 day − 1. Q 10 for barramundi increased significantly with increasing temperature (p< 0. 0001). Q 10 (18 – 28) was the lowest at 1. 7 and Q 10 (28 – 38) the highest at 1. 9, over the whole experiment temp range Q 10 (18 – 28) was 1. 8.

40|$|Flow-through <b>respirometry</b> systems provide {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} gas exchange {{over long periods}} of time. However, these systems have limitations in tracking rapid changes. When an animal infuses a metabolic gas into the <b>respirometry</b> chamber in a short burst, diffusion and airflow in the chamber gradually alter the original signal before it arrives at the gas analyzer. For single or multiple bursts, the recorded signal is smeared or mixed, which may result in dramatically altered recordings compared to the emitted signal. Recovering the original metabolic signal is a difficult task because of the inherent ill conditioning problem. Here, we present two new methods to recover the fast dynamics of metabolic patterns from recorded data. We first re-derive the equations of the well-known Z-transform method (ZT method) to show the source of imprecision in this method. Then, we develop a new model of analysis for <b>respirometry</b> systems based on the experimentally determined impulse response, which is the response of the system to a very short unit input. As a result, we present a major modification of the ZT method (dubbed the 'EZT method') by using a new model for the impulse response, enhancing its precision to recover the true metabolic signals. The second method, the generalized Z-transform (GZT) method, was then developed by generalizing the EZT method; it can be applied to any flow-through <b>respirometry</b> system with any arbitrary impulse response. Experiments verified that the accuracy of recovering the true metabolic signals is significantly improved by the new methods. These new methods can be used more broadly for input estimation in variety of physiological systems...|$|E
