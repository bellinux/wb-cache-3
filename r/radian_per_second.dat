50|$|Note {{that because}} the radian is a {{dimensionless}} unit, the <b>radian</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> is dimensionally equivalent to the hertz—both are defined as one s−1. This means that great {{care must be taken}} to avoid confusing angular frequency ω and frequency ν.|$|E
50|$|In physics, the {{gyromagnetic ratio}} (also {{sometimes}} {{known as the}} magnetogyric ratio in other disciplines) of a particle or system is the ratio of its magnetic moment to its angular momentum, and it is often denoted by the symbol γ, gamma. Its SI unit is the <b>radian</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> per tesla (rad&sdot;s−1&sdot;T−1) or, equivalently, the coulomb per kilogram (C&sdot;kg−1).|$|E

50|$|One of the {{important}} uses of the unit <b>radian</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> is in calculation of the power transmitted by a shaft. In the International System, widely used in physics and engineering, the power, p, delivered to the shaft is given by the product of ω (in radians per second) times the torque, τ, in newton-meters applied to the shaft. Thus, p = ω • τ, and the unit is the watt, with no numerical coefficient needed.|$|E
