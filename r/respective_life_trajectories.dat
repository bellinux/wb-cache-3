Our empirical data were 20 semi-structured narrative interviews with entrepreneurs analyzed based on grounded theory (open and axial coding). We analyzed individual <b>life</b> <b>trajectories</b> as “trees of choices,” where the main branches are institutions of socialization, and the subsequent branches—individual life features. Finally, we showed the meanings of each institution and found out the determining role of gender and the city of socialization.

A first contribution is anchored in the main existing framework for sequence analysis, based on the computation of pairwise dissimilarities between sequences. It addresses the issue of summarizing sets of <b>life</b> <b>trajectories</b> with typical patterns.

40|$|Objectives: This {{paper offers}} an {{overview}} of the findings of research into the experience of having cancer in adolescence and young adulthood, the aims of which were to understand how age and life stage affect the illness experience and impact upon biographies and <b>life</b> <b>trajectories.</b> Methods: The data were gathered primarily through the use of in-depth qualitative interviews with adolescents and young adults with cancer, but also through the submission of a small number of written narratives. Results: Acute and life-threatening illness at a transitional life stage on the threshold of adulthood can have a long-term, and therefore chronic, effect on the <b>life</b> <b>trajectories</b> and biographies of young adult cancer patients. Many aspects of the participants' lives were affected, including education, careers, life plans, friendship networks, appearance, sexuality and fertility. The economic effects could also be far-reaching and contribute to a loss of independence, which is very fragile in this age-group. Conclusions: While recognizing the potentially devastating impact of cancer at any age, the research findings suggest a distinct effect in adolescence and young adulthood resulting from a disrupted biography at a critical transitional moment in the <b>life</b> <b>trajectory</b> that can have a chronic effect after the acute stage of the illness is passed. An age-appropriate approach to the care of young people with cancer that takes into account the distinct effects of life stage in this age-group can mitigate the negative impact on <b>life</b> <b>trajectories</b> and maximize the chances of adherence and a return to normal life after recovery...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to uncover the types of {{violence}} underlying the life histories of institutionalized women from the women's perspective and point of view. We analysed the life histories of six women who began their <b>life</b> <b>trajectories</b> in situations of vulnerability as adults. The results show that these <b>life</b> <b>trajectories</b> are affected by various types of underlying intrafamily and gender-based violence against women. One of the main conclusions is that violence, whether intrafamily or gender-based, is an important factor in gender-specific social exclusion, added to which is a lack of institutional support. This forms a barrier that prevents or hinders women with dependants from escaping the violence by themselves, and for this reason it can be considered institutional violence (insofar as the state tolerates and allows it) ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The <b>trajectories</b> of <b>life</b> {{satisfaction}} for 609 individuals who sustained a {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI) were studied. Hierarchical linear modeling analysis examined individual level growth trends over the first 5 years following TBI using gender, functional independence, age, and time to estimate <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>trajectories.</b> Measures: Participants completed the Functional Independence Measure and the Life Satisfaction Inventory at years 1, 2, 4, and 5 after sustaining TBI. Results: Participants who reported higher functional independence at year 1 also had higher life satisfaction at year 1. Participants with lower functional independence across the 5 -year period had <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>trajectories</b> that decreased at significantly greater rates than the individuals with more functional independence. The <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>trajectory</b> declined for the sample, but participants reporting lower cognitive and motor functional independence had significantly greater declines in <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>trajectories.</b> Age and gender were not significant factors in predicting <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>trajectories</b> following TBI.

40|$|In {{this article}} we compare two {{techniques}} that are widely used {{in the analysis of}} <b>life</b> course <b>trajectories,</b> latent class analysis (LCA) and sequence analysis (SA). In particular, we focus on the use of these techniques as devices to obtain classes of individual <b>life</b> course <b>trajectories.</b> We first compare the consistency of the classification obtained via the two techniques using an actual dataset on the <b>life</b> course <b>trajectories</b> of young adults. Then, we adopt a simulation approach to measure the ability of these two methods to correctly classify groups of <b>life</b> course <b>trajectories</b> when specific forms of "random" variability are introduced within pre-specified classes in an artificial dataset. In order to do so, we introduce simulation operators that have a life course and/or observational meaning.

40|$|Life course {{scholars}} have theorised {{the relationship between}} individual <b>life</b> <b>trajectories</b> and geographic phenomena such as migration, partnering, reproduction, and locational choice.

This special section thus contributes to both life course geographies and ongoing feminist interventions into the fieldwork process. In understanding fieldwork experiences through a life course approach, the contributors to this special section simultaneously deepen and systematise much of feminist geographic research on fieldwork. Their work highlights how life events and turning points, including those before, during and beyond fieldwork, can profoundly change—or be changed by—research experiences and outcomes.
