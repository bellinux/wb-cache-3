It attained 5.749 million viewers and garnered a 1.8/5 rating in the 18–49 demographic {{in its first}} hour. Gaga's special aired simultaneously with the reruns of The Simpsons on FOX, Person of Interest on CBS, and The Secret Circle on The CW. In its second hour, total viewership and ratings slightly declined to 5.388 million viewers and a 1.6/5 <b>ratings</b> <b>in</b> the 18–49 demographic, despite airing simultaneously with a recap of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on NBC and a rerun of The Mentalist on CBS.

5|$|Having been {{interested}} in aviation {{since he was a}} boy, Plagis volunteered for the Southern Rhodesian Air Force (SRAF) soon after the outbreak of war in September 1939.

After Italy invaded Greece in late October 1940, bringing the Greeks into the war on the Allied side, Plagis applied again—this time to join the Royal Air Force, which had absorbed the SRAF in April 1940—and was accepted. Training first in Southern Rhodesia, then England, Plagis passed out with the rank of flight sergeant in June 1941 with above-average <b>ratings</b> <b>in</b> all of his flying assessments.|$|E
