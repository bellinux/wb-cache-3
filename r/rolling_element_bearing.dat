40|$|For the {{quantitative}} fault diagnosis of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearings,</b> a nonlinear vibration model for fault severity assessment of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearings</b> is established in this study. The outer race defect size parameter is {{introduced into the}} dynamic model, and vibration response signals of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearings</b> under different fault sizes are simulated. The signals are analyzed quantitatively to observe the relationship between vibration responses and fault sizes. The impact points when the ball rolls onto {{and away from the}} defect are identified from the vibration response signals. Next, the impact characteristic that reflects the fault severity in <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearings</b> is obtained from the time interval between two impact points. When the width of the bearing fault is small, the signals are presented as clear single impact. The signals gradually become double impacts with increasing size of defects. The vibration signals of a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearings</b> test rig are measured for different outer race fault sizes. The experimental results agree well with the results from simulations. These results are useful for understanding the vibration response mechanism of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearings</b> under various degrees of fault severity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A composite bearing is not simply a PTFE bearing in a carrier of another material, this is a PTFE bearing in a carrier. The plain composite bearing can be lighter than a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearing</b> but this is not always a feature as some composites are extremely dense which results in lower porosity.

[...] Bearing life is statistical: several samples of a given bearing will often exhibit a bell curve of service life, with a few samples showing significantly better or worse life.

5000|$|To obtain proper rolling {{action of}} the balls, as in a {{standard}} ball bearing, it is necessary that, when loaded in one direction, the ball makes contact at one point with the nut, and one point with the screw. In practice, most ball screws {{are designed to be}} lightly preloaded, so that there is at least a slight load on the ball at four points, two in contact with the nut and two in contact with the screw. This is accomplished by using a thread profile that has a slightly larger radius than the ball, the difference in radii being kept small (e.g. a simple V thread with flat faces is unsuitable) so that elastic deformation around the point of contact allows a small, but non-zero contact area to be obtained, like any other <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearing.</b> To this end, the threads are usually machined as a [...] "gothic arch" [...] profile. If a simple semicircular thread profile were used, contact would only be at two points, on the outer and inner edges, which would not resist axial loading.|$|E

50|$|There {{is still}} a room for {{discussion}} whether the rolling element excites the natural frequencies of bearing component when it passes the fault on the outer race. Hence we need to identify the bearing outer race natural frequency and its harmonics. The bearing faults create impulses and results in strong harmonics of the fault frequencies in the spectrum of vibration signals. These fault frequencies are sometimes masked by adjacent frequencies in the spectra due to their little energy. Hence, a very high spectral resolution is often needed to identify these frequencies during a FFT analysis. The natural frequencies of a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearing</b> with the free boundary conditions are 3 kHz. Therefore, {{in order to use}} the bearing component resonance bandwidth method to detect the bearing fault at an initial stage a high frequency range accelerometer should be adopted, and data obtained from a long duration needs to be acquired. A fault characteristic frequency can only be identified when the fault extent is severe, such as that of a presence of a hole in the outer race. The harmonics of fault frequency is a more sensitive indicator of a bearing outer race fault. For a more serious detection of defected bearing faults waveform, spectrum and envelope techniques will help reveal these faults. However, if a high frequency demodulation is used in the envelope analysis in order to detect bearing fault characteristic frequencies, the maintenance professionals have to be more careful in the analysis because of resonance, as {{it may or may not}} contain fault frequency components.|$|E

40|$|Rolling <b>element</b> <b>bearings</b> are an {{important}} unit in the rotating machines, and their performance degradation assessment {{is the basis of}} condition-based maintenance. Targeting the non-linear dynamic characteristics of faulty signals of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearings,</b> a bearing performance degradation assessment approach based on improved fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) is proposed in this paper. FuzzyEn has less dependence on data length and achieves more freedom of parameter selection and more robustness to noise. However, it neglects the global trend of the signal when calculating similarity degree of two vectors, and thus cannot reflect the running state of the <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearings</b> accurately. Based on this consideration, the algorithm of FuzzyEn is improved in this paper and the improved FuzzyEn is utilized as an indicator for bearing performance degradation evaluation. The vibration data from run-to-failure test of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearings</b> are used to validate the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the traditional kurtosis and root mean square, the proposed method can detect the incipient fault in advance and can reflect the whole performance degradation process more clearly...|$|R
40|$|To {{extend the}} service life of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearings</b> {{lubricant}} {{such as oil}} or grease is used. In the lubricated contacts between the rollers and the raceways pressures of several GPa can occur. In that case the elastic deformation of the rollers and the raceways has {{a significant effect on}} the film thickness and shape. Such contacts are referred to as Elasto-Hydrodynamically Lubricated (EHL) contacts. When the thickness of the lubricant film in an EHL contact is reduced due to insufficient supply of lubricant, it is operating in the so-called starved lubrication regime. This typically occurs in grease lubricated <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearings.</b> As most bearings are lubricated with grease, accurate prediction of the EHL film thickness in starved lubricated <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearings</b> is of great importance. The film thickness in a starved EHL contact {{is directly related to the}} thickness of the lubricant layers on the running tracks supplied to the contact. Therefore, accurate models predicting the thickness of these supply layers are a prerequisite to the reliable prediction of the film thickness in <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearings</b> operating in the starved regime. In <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearings</b> the thickness of these supply layers is determined by many effects. In this thesis in particular two effects are modelled: the centrifugal effect and the contact pressure effect. The flow of the liquid layers is effectively modelled using the lubrication approximation. The model is successfully validated experimentally using optical interferometry. It can be used to predict the layer thickness for millions of revolutions and for multiple contacts, without having to solve the starved EHL contact problem for each contact individually...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the noise}} {{accompanied}} with <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearing</b> fault signal, it {{can reduce the}} accuracy of faulty diagnoses. In order to improve the robustness of a faulty diagnosis, this study proposed a fault diagnosis model based on modified local linear embedding (M-LLE) algorithm. Aiming at the characteristics of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearing</b> fault data, the vibration signal was first analyzed in time domain and frequency domain to construct high dimension eigenvectors. Next, the high-dimensional eigenvectors {{can be reduced to}} low-dimensional eigenvectors by M-LLE algorithm. In the M-LLE algorithm, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) metric is adopted to replace Euclidean distance in traditional neighborhood construction and L 1 -norm is used to standardize weight matrix, which can enhance the anti-noise ability of the Local Linear Embedding (LLE) algorithm. Finally, fault diagnosis results can be obtained when low-dimensional <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearing</b> fault data is classified by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier. By simulating the noisy artificial data sets in different degrees, the proposed algorithm can get the perfect local structure of manifolds. The effectiveness of M-LLE algorithm can be proved. In addition, experimental results of real <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> <b>bearing</b> data which provided by the University of Cincinnati show that the accuracies of all kinds of faults can reach 100 %.
