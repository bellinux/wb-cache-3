40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} an innovative procedure for calibrating sets for evaluating instrument current transformer (ICT) errors. The innovation {{lies in the}} use of a current source for generating a measured current. There is an adjustable current source at 50 Hz mains frequency with a current transformer on its output. The internal impedance must be sufficiently high to eliminate the methodic error due to calibration. Calibration is carried out by means of a measuring system controlled by a PC through an IEEE 488 bus. Known values of the simulated <b>ratio</b> <b>error</b> and phase displacement are compared with the values measured by the device that is being tested. A software tool determines the simulated and measured error at each calibration point and determines whether the instrument that is being tested fulfils the parameters stated by the manufacturer. I.

As a result, target prices can be stated {{as a function of}} both earnings forecasts and the price-earnings (PE) ratios at which those earnings are capitalised. I investigate whether error in target prices is attributable to separable, inde-pendent error in earnings forecasts and PE ratios, or whether PE ratios are unbiased and target price error is simply a mechanical function of variation in earnings forecasts. Using a novel methodology, I decompose target price error into PE-attributable and earnings-attributable components, generate an estimate from this of actual PE <b>ratio</b> <b>error</b> measured in multiples and investigate the variation in this PE <b>ratio</b> <b>error</b> over time and in the cross section.

40|$|Characteristic {{distributions}} of <b>errors</b> across fixed <b>ratio</b> schedules of reinforcement were studied for {{two types of}} discrimination paradigms. Two experiments studied error patterns {{as a function of}} hypothesis behavior in two species of animals, children and pigeons. Three key zero-delay matching-to-sample and two key simultaneous discrimination were reinforced for both species of animals on fixed ratio schedules of reinforcement. Experiment 1 involved children on matching-to-sample and simultaneous discrimination, and Experiment 2 involved pigeons on matching-to-sample and simultaneous discrimination. Both species of subjects experienced experimental conditions in which shift or stay response hypotheses were selectively reinforced using a high speed digital computer. Data protocols were scored into four exhaustive error classes; winstay, lose - shift; win-shift, lose-stay; win - stay, lose-stay; and win-shift, lose-shift errors. These four error types were scored by frequency of occurrence and response latency for the ordinal positions of the fixed ratio. Two types of error patterns were defined for individual subjects. A standard error pattern was defined as having 15 % more first half <b>ratio</b> <b>errors</b> than last half <b>ratio</b> <b>errors.</b> A reversed error pattern was defined as having 15 % more last half <b>ratio</b> <b>errors</b> than first half <b>ratio</b> <b>errors.</b> Experimental results indicated that selective reinforcement of particular response hypotheses produced only small effects for either species of animal on matching-to-sample or simultaneous discrimination. Response latencies for matching-to-sample and simultaneous discrimination were divided into two classes. The first class included long latency responses occurring immediately after reinforcement for children and pigeons. The second class included shorter latencies in the succeeding ordinal positions of the ratio for children and pigeons. A majority of standard error patterns were produced when the total errors were separated into specific error types for low accuracy subjects of both species. The standard error pattern was lost for total errors due to a very high frequency of win-shift, lose-shift errors which were not distributed in any characteristic pattern. Higher accuracy subjects of both species tended to show a majority of reversed error patterns or no patterning when total errors were separated into error types. These subjects had very low frequencies of win-shift, lose-shift errors. The high frequency of win-shift, lose-shift errors in both species of animals across discrimination paradigms could be due to the complexity of the discrimination, a developmental age base for human subjects, or a 0 -second intertrial interval...|$|R

The final step in the algorithm consists of an adaptive buddy check that either accepts or rejects outlier observations based on a local statistical analysis of nearby data.
