Another notable feature of the console is the now defunct WiiConnect24, which enabled it to receive messages and updates over the Internet while in standby mode.

500|$|Apart from S Voice, Samsung has {{directed}} {{the bulk of}} the SIII's marketing campaign towards the device's [...] "smart" [...] features, which facilitate improved human-device interactivity. These features include: [...] "Direct Call", or the handset's ability to recognise when a user wants to talk to somebody instead of messaging them, if they bring the phone to their head; [...] "Social Tag", a function that identifies and tags people in a photo and shares photos with them; and [...] "Pop Up Play", which allows a video and other applications to occupy the screen at the same time. In addition, the SIII can beam its screen to a monitor or be used as a <b>remote</b> <b>controller</b> (AllShare Cast and Play) and share photos with people who are tagged in them (Buddy Photo Share).|$|E
500|$|Initially codenamed [...] "Revolution" [...] {{during a}} teaser at E3 2004, {{following}} Iwata's goal {{of creating a}} gaming revolution, Iwata publicly revealed the Wii at E3 2005, holding it above his head to emphasize its small size and light weight design. Reveal of the Wii's signature Wii <b>Remote</b> <b>controller</b> was withheld until the Tokyo Game Show in September2005. During his speech at the conference, Iwata reiterated his stance on growing the gaming market but expanded upon it by emphasizing {{the need to make}} controls less complicated. The controller's remote control design partially stemmed from Iwata's desire to have a device that was [...] "immediately accessible" [...] to all. He also insisted that the Wii Remote be referred to as simply a [...] "remote" [...] rather than a controller to emphasize its accessibility to anyone.|$|E

50|$|Electronic {{controls}} are used extensively. Many stairlifts have radio frequency or infrared <b>remote</b> <b>controllers.</b> It {{is known that}} radiation from devices such as fluorescent lights can interfere with infrared stairlift controls.

40|$|The Wii <b>Remote</b> <b>controllers</b> {{can be used}} {{to detect}} the {{position}} of IR lights. They can be connected to a workstation using Bluetooth. Two controllers attached to one workstation allow to determine the position of an IR light from two views. Stereovision algorithms combine the differences in two views of a scene to extract 3 D information. Calibration calculates camera parameters, triangulation determines the 3 D position of a point using these parameters. For calibration the RANSAC and LMedS algorithms give the best results, while the normalized 8 point algorithm is not far behind. Triangulation works best with the polynomial algorithm. Using two Wii <b>Remote</b> <b>controllers</b> and the sterevision algorithms described in this report, the position of an IR light can be estimated. ...|$|R

2500|$|The Wii was {{released}} {{during the holiday}} season of 2006 worldwide. The system features the Wii <b>Remote</b> <b>controller,</b> which {{can be used as a}} handheld pointing device and which detects movement in three dimensions. Another notable feature of the console is WiiConnect24, which enables it to receive messages and updates over the Internet while in standby mode. It also features a game download service, called [...] "Virtual Console", which features emulated games from past systems. Since its release, the Wii has spawned many peripheral devices, including the Wii Balance Board and Motion Plus, and has had several hardware revisions. The Wii Family Edition variant is identical to the original model, but is designed to sit horizontally and removes the GameCube compatibility. The Wii Mini is a smaller, redesigned Wii which lacks GameCube compatibility, online connectivity, the SD card slot and Wi-Fi support, and has only one USB port unlike the previous models' two. , Nintendo reports sales of 101.63 million Wii hardware units and 914.28 million Wii software units worldwide, making it Nintendo's best-selling home video game console.|$|E
2500|$|The Blab-off was a wired {{remote control}} created in 1952 that turned a TV's sound {{on or off}} so that viewers could avoid hearing commercials. In the 1980s Steve Wozniak of Apple started a company named CL 9. The purpose of this company {{was to create a}} remote control that could operate {{multiple}} electronic devices. The CORE unit (Controller Of Remote Equipment) was introduced in the fall of 1987. The advantage to this <b>remote</b> <b>controller</b> was that it could [...] "learn" [...] remote signals from different devices. It had the ability to perform specific or multiple functions at various times with its built-in clock. It was the first remote control that could be linked to a computer and loaded with updated software code as needed. The CORE unit never made a huge impact on the market. It was much too cumbersome for the average user to program, but it received rave reviews from those who could. These obstacles eventually led to the demise of CL 9, but two of its employees continued the business under the name Celadon. This {{was one of the first}} computer-controlled learning remote controls on the market.|$|E
2500|$|Subtitles {{are derived}} from either a {{transcript}} or screenplay of the dialog or commentary in films, television programs, video games, and the like, usually displayed {{at the bottom of}} the screen, but can also be at the top of the screen if there is already text {{at the bottom of the}} screen. They can either be a form of written translation of a dialog in a foreign language, or a written rendering of the dialog in the same language, with or without added information to help viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing to follow the dialog, or people who cannot understand the spoken dialogue or who have accent recognition problems. [...] The encoded method can either be pre-rendered with the video or separate as either a graphic or text to be rendered and overlaid by the receiver. [...] The separate subtitles are used for DVD, Blu-ray and television teletext/Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) subtitling or EIA-608 captioning, which are hidden unless requested by the viewer from a menu or <b>remote</b> <b>controller</b> key or by selecting the relevant page or service (e.g., p.888 or CC1), always carry additional sound representations for deaf and hard of hearing viewers. Teletext subtitle language follows the original audio, except in multi-lingual countries where the broadcaster may provide subtitles in additional languages on other teletext pages. [...] EIA-608 captions are similar, except that North American Spanish stations may provide captioning in Spanish on CC3. DVD and Blu-ray only differ in using run-length encoded graphics instead of text, as well as some HD DVB broadcasts.|$|E
