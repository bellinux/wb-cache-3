40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Plastics fuel tanks have been used successfully abroad; metal counterparts are still predominant in this country plastics tanks have to satisfy stringent performance regulations : low temperature impact tests; permeability; and fire resistance. Blow moulded high density polyethylene (HDPE) fuel tanks have superior strength to mass ratio compared with metal equivalents (the density of steel is about 8000 kg/m 3 compared with HDPE, which has a density of under 1000 kg/m 3). HDPE will tend to drip in a fire situation, thus reducing explosion risk. HDPE is the chosen material because it possesses inherent properties suitable for the blow moulding process : it has a high viscosity at low stresses; and is highly inert. Rotational moulded HDPE fuel tanks can also be considered. However, these are shown to have inferior properties when compared with blow moulded tanks; attraction of rotational moulding is the cheapness of equipment. Petrol immersion was found to enhance impact properties of HDPE, although yield stresses were lowered slightly. The thickness distributions of blow moulded fuel tanks were found to vary; {{this is because of}} the present difficulty of predicting parison behaviour with respect to time. Thickness is important because of impact strength and permeation considerations. Impact properties of fuel tanks were assessed; peak force of impact was found to be heavily dependent on thickness (raised to the power 1. 1) and temperature of mould in the blow moulding process (a low mould temperature led to inferior properties). Pinch-offs were found to be particularly detrimental to impact properties. Cooling behaviour was investigated. With the aid of a cooling model for blow mouldings, it was found that a warm mould (40 ·C) could be used with internal air circulation to obtain a cooling time the same as that with a cold mould and no air circulation. Thus optimising mechanical strength and maintaining economic viability. Welding of injection moulded fittings to the main blow moulded body of the fuel tank was found to be faulty, in all of the tanks examined; many weld failures have been reported in use. This work determines optimum welding conditions for HDPE grades, these are <b>Rigidex</b> H 060 - 45 P and Lupolen 426 l-A...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This study is an industrial project commissioned by British Gas plc. (UK) to investigate the state of in-service naturally aged polyethylene (PE) buried pipes and to define procedures or techniques available to facilitate the condition assessment programme of PE pipelines systems. The primary goal {{of this study was}} to establish a better understanding of the ageing process in commercial piping materials and to understand its effect on long term integrity of PE pipeline systems. Eltex, <b>Rigidex</b> and Aldyl A are trade names of the PE gas grade resins used in this study and they represent the range of pipe materials used in the transport of potable water and gas in the UK. Sections of pipes used in this project were supplied by British Gas plc. in the form of unaged pipes and pipes which were aged in-service. Laboratory based accelerated ageing of the pipe resin samples was also carried out. The ageing regimes considered were water ageing at 23 °C, air-oven ageing at 80 °C, water ageing at 80 C, vacuum ageing at 80 °C and in-service aged samples. Compression moulded plaques were produced as reference material. By utilising specific instrumentation and designs, several reliable procedures were developed to produce specimens directly from pipes. The feasibility of using micro-samples instead of large samples was demonstrated. A methodology was developed to retrieve disk samples using electrofusion "tapping-tee" saddles. Appropriate test specimens were designed for chemical and physical evaluations. This sampling method negates the need for excavating large sections of pipe material for the purpose of condition assessment. Reliable micro and macro-sampling test methods were developed and established as techniques for the condition assessment programme. Characterisation techniques included: (i) differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to measure (from the same specimen) both the degree of crystallinity and the oxidation induction time (OIT), (ii) HPLC analysis was used to quantify additives concentrations, (iii) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor the carbonyl index and to identify a pipe resin type from site, (iv) micro- and macro-tensile and fatigue tests to assess the changes in the mechanical properties as function of ageing. The fatigue test procedure was developed to produce brittle fracture at laboratory scale within a shorter period of time as compared to existing procedures such as the hydrostatic test. A reference data-base was created using the above identified tools and the criteria and methodology for carrying out site condition assessment inspection was compiled. The fundamental mechanisms of chemical and physical ageing were studied along with the possibility of their effect on the mechanical properties of PE pipes. British Ga...|$|E

The butt fusion process is extensively used in the joining of polyethylene (PE) pipes by the water and gas industries. This welding process although deceptively simple, is rather poorly understood, {{with much of the}} initial developments being of a rather empirical nature. The Water Research centre (WRc) have funded the present research in an attempt to optimise the welding of high pressure pipeline (PE 100) systems. The main aims of this research were to investigate the effect of different welding conditions on the physical and mechanical properties of the joints produced and to investigate these effects on the micro- and macro-structures of the joints produced. A series of welds were made using Eltex Tub 124 and <b>Rigidex</b> 002 - 50 pipes of 180 mm diameter. The fusion pressure and heatsoak times were varied. A milling machine witha twin cutter arrangement was used to obtain the test specimens from around the circumference of the pipes. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to study the effect of sample preparation methodology on the thermo-oxidative stability. Polarised light microscopy and image analysis were used to study the macro- and micro-structural developments in the weld joint. Joint strength was evaluated via standard and non-standard tensile test methods. Milling the samples to produce the test specimens was found to decrease significantly the thermo-oxidative resistance of the polymer. Reasons for this behaviour have been proposed. In order to achieve high quality thin films from microtomy, custom-made blades were used. This programme also developed the optimum polishing method for the microtomed blades. The macro-structure of the bead: its shape and dimensions were found to be a function of temperature and pressure. Correlation was found between the bead geometry and the position around the circumference of the pipe. The macrostructures within the weld zone also showed this dependence on the position along the circumference of the pipe. An examination of the microstructures of each weld had shown the presence of five different zones. The feasibility of using microtomed thin sections in a tensile test was demonstrated. The test method provides a means to study failure initiation and propagation in the tensile test specimen. Initial deformation was found to occur in the centre of the melt-affected zone (MAZ) and the final failure occurs at the junction of the weld bead and the bulk polymer. Tests on films without the weld bead showed that maximum deformation occurred at the centre of the sample within the MAZ. The presence of the bead and the asymmetry in the test specimens caused by the welding process were found to have a significant influence on the failure mode and the failure strain. The strain rate was also found to {{play a significant role in}} both beaded and debeaded samples. The failure was initiated from the pseudo notches in the beaded samples. In the debeaded sample the failure was within the MAZ...|$|E
