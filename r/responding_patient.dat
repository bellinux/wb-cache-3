Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is {{implicated in the}} development of GBM and the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab has shown early clinical promise against malignant glioma. We treated six patients with recurrent GBM using bevacizumab combined with carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy (ACE regimen).

This pilot study assesses {{the value of}} quantitation of metabolic rate of glucose (MRGlu) measured in mmol min− 1 ml− 1 to assess early subclinical response to therapy in a relatively non-responsive tumour. Nine patients receiving the CRC Phase II study schedule of temozolomide were assessed with [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18 F]FDG) dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scans prior to and 14 days after treatment with temozolomide given as 750 – 1000 mg m− 2 over 5 days every 28 days. Tumour MRGlu was calculated and compared with objective response at 8 weeks. Pretreatment MRGlu was higher in responders than non-responders. The <b>responding</b> <b>patient</b> group had a greater than 25 % reduction in MRGlu in regions of high focal tumour uptake (HFU). Whole tumour changes in MRGlu did not correlate with response.

Large differences also occurred in the normal brain SUV following treatment. Thus, MRGlu appeared to be a more sensitive discriminator of response than the simplified static SUV analysis.

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of using thalidomide for treating selected patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC, and their disease was refractory to systemic chemotherapy. Methods: Eight patients with measurable and metastatic HCC that had progressed with prior systemic chemotherapy and who desired further active therapy were enrolled in this study. Thalidomide was given orally at bedtime and it was started at 200 mg/day with no further dose escalation. The response was measured at 2 -month intervals. Results: The median age was 44 years (range: 34 - 52 years) and all the patients had received doxorubicin-based systemic chemotherapy prior to their enrollment. Each patient received thalidomide for a median of 152 days (range: 5 - 422 days). One partial response was observed (12. 5 %, 95 % CI; 0 - 42 %) along with 4 cases of stable diseases.

We have treated 26 CML patients with posttransplantation relapse with CD 8 -depleted DLI. Thirteen of 15 patients (87 %) who relapsed in early-phase CML achieved complete cytogenetic response, but only 1 of 11 who relapsed in advanced-phase disease achieved complete response. Acute GVHD occurred in 2 patients (8 %), and extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 2 patients (11 %). Treatment-related mortality was 11. 5 %. Responses were durable; with a median follow-up of 4. 2 years (1 - 7. 5 years), only 1 <b>responding</b> <b>patient</b> relapsed (7 %). CD 8 -depleted DLI was equally effective and safe after unrelated donor transplants and sibling transplants. Cytogenetic clonal evolution at the time of DLI was not predictive of treatment failure unless associated with hematologic criteria for disease acceleration. CD 8 depletion is an effective method to separate GVL from GVHD for posttransplantation relapsed CML. This strategy is associated with durable complete remissions and a low rate of complications and therefore merits further investigation in larger-scale comparative trials.

40|$|The {{identification}} of antigens associated with tumor destruction {{is a major}} goal of cancer immunology. Vaccination with irradiated tumor cells engineered to secrete granulocyte–macrophage colony stimulating factor generates potent, specific, and long-lasting antitumor immunity through improved tumor antigen presentation by dendritic cells and macrophages. A phase I clinical trial of this immunization strategy in patients with disseminated melanoma revealed the consistent induction in distant metastases of dense T and B cell infiltrates that effectuated substantial tumor necrosis and fibrosis. To delineate the target antigens of this vaccine-stimulated tumor destruction, we screened a melanoma cDNA expression library with postimmunization sera from a long-term <b>responding</b> <b>patient</b> (K 030). High-titer IgG antibodies recognized melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP), a caspase antagonist containing a single baculoviral IAP repeat and a COOH-terminal RING domain. Although K 030 harbored antibodies to ML-IAP {{at the time of}} study entry, multiple courses of vaccination over 4 years increased antibody titers and elicited isotype switching. Moreover, lymphocyte infiltrates in necrotic metastases included CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells specific for ML-IAP, as revealed by proliferation, tetramer, enzyme-linked immunospot, and cytotoxicity analysis. Whereas melanoma cells in densely infiltrated lesions showed strong ML-IAP expression by immunohistochemistry, lethal disease progression was associated with the loss of ML-IAP staining and the absence of lymphocyte infiltrates. These findings demonstrate that ML-IAP can serve as a target for immune-mediated tumor destruction, but that antigen-loss variants can accomplish immune escape...|$|E

40|$|Malignant {{melanoma}} {{has been}} shown to be susceptible to T cell-mediated immunity and, therefore, is a candidate for vaccination approaches. Clinical trials using dendritic cells (DC) loaded with peptides corresponding to tumor antigens are ongoing in several institutions, and some promising results have already been published. However, every single peptide-based vaccine can only be used in a patient with a given single HLA type, and this strategy is not appropriate for patients with rare HLA types or with tumors without defined antigens. A clinical pilot study in patients with disseminated melanoma refractory to standard therapy was initiated using a different approach. The authors generated autologous monocyte-derived DC and fused these DC with gamma-irradiated primary autologous tumor cells by incubation in polyethylene glycol. In previous experiments, the authors had shown that these fused cell products are potent inducers of a T-cell response in a mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture. Seventeen patients were immunized with the cell product by s. c. injection in monthly intervals without any serious side effects.

We have performed a Phase 1 {{study to determine}} safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetic profile (PK) and efficacy in patients with solid tumours expressing EGFR or HER 2. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Subjects had advanced tumours not suitable for standard treatment, expressing EGFR or HER 2, and/or with amplified HER 2. Daily oral doses of S- 222611 were escalated from 100 mg to 1600 mg. Full plasma concentration profiles for drug and metabolites were obtained. RESULTS: 33 patients received S- 222611. It was well tolerated, and the most common toxicities, almost all mild (grade 1 or 2), were diarrhoea, fatigue, rash and nausea. Only two dose-limiting toxicities occurred (diarrhoea and rash), which resolved on interruption. MTD was not reached. Plasma exposure increased with dose up to 800 mg, exceeding levels eliciting pre-clinical responses. The plasma terminal half-life was more than 24 h, supporting once daily dosing. Responses were seen {{over a wide range}} of doses in oesophageal, breast and renal tumours, including a complete clinical response in a patient with HER 2 -positive breast carcinoma previously treated with lapatinib and trastuzumab.

40|$|An {{important}} goal of cancer immunology is {{the identification of}} antigens associated with tumor destruction. Vaccination with irradiated tumor cells engineered to secrete granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) generates potent, specific, and long-lasting antitumor immunity in multiple murine tumor models. A phase I clinical trial of this vaccination strategy in patients with advanced melanoma demonstrated the consistent induction of dense CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrates in distant metastases, resulting in extensive tumor destruction, fibrosis, and edema. Antimelanoma antibody and cytotoxic T cell responses were associated with tumor cell death. To characterize the targets of these responses, we screened an autologous cDNA expression library prepared from a densely infiltrated metastasis with postvaccination sera from a long-term <b>responding</b> <b>patient.</b> High-titer IgG antibodies detected ATP 6 S 1, a putative accessory unit of the vacuolar H+–ATPase complex. A longitudinal analysis of this patient revealed an association between the vaccine-induced increase in antibodies to ATP 6 S 1 and tumor destruction. Three additional vaccinated melanoma patients and three metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma patients vaccinated with autologous GM-CSF-secreting tumor cells similarly showed a correlation between humoral responses to ATP 6 S 1 and tumor destruction. Moreover, a chronic myelogenous leukemia patient who experienced a complete remission after CD 4 + donor lymphocyte infusions also developed high-titer antibodies to ATP 6 S 1. Lastly, vaccination with GM-CSF-secreting B 16 melanoma cells stimulated high-titer antibodies to ATPS 1 in a murine model.

After applying predefined exclusion criteria based on lack of sufficient RNA quality and/or quantity, the data from 45 patients were used to construct a gene expression profile to predict poor <b>responding</b> <b>patients,</b> defined as disease progression or death < 9 months, by a leave-one-out cross validation. Results: Of the 45 patients, 19 were clinically classified as poor responders. To identify them, the 75 % most variable genes were used to select genes differentially expressed between good and poor responders. An 8 -gene CTC predictor {{was significantly associated with}} outcome (Hazard Ratio [HR] 4. 40, 95 % Confidence Interval [CI]: 2. 17 - 8. 92, P < 0. 001). This predictor identified poor <b>responding</b> <b>patients</b> with a sensitivity of 63 % and a positive predictive value of 75 %, while good <b>responding</b> <b>patients</b> were correctly predicted in 85 % of the cases.

Responses were observed in patients regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression or presence of Merkel cell polyomavirus.|$|R
40|$|By {{using the}} GRADE system, we updated the {{guidelines}} for management of follicular cell lymphoma issued in 2006 from SIE, SIES, and GITMO group. We confirmed our recommendation to frontline chemoimmunotherapy in patients with Stage III-IV disease and/or high tumor burden. Maintenance rituximab was also recommended in <b>responding</b> <b>patients.</b> In patients relapsing after an interval longer than 12 months from frontline therapy, we recommended chemoimmunotherapy with non cross-resistant regimens followed by rituximab maintenance. High dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplant was recommended for young fit patients who achieve a response after salvage chemoimmunotherapy. Am. J.

40|$|Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a small {{molecule}} inhibitor of abl, kit, and platelet-derived {{growth factor}} receptor (PDGFR) tyrosine kinases, {{has been reported}} to be effective in the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and a rare eosinophilia-associated chronic myeloid disorder (eos-CMD) characterized by the t(5; 12) (q 33;p 13) cytogenetic abnormality. In the current study, we sought to confirm the preliminary observations in HES as well as evaluate the therapeutic value of imatinib in eos-CMD that is not associated with t(5; 12) (q 33;p 13). Five patients with HES (all men, median age = 46 years) and 2 with eos-CMD (both men, aged 45 and 58 years) were treated with imatinib at a starting dose of 100 to 400 mg/day. Cytogenetic studies showed no evidence of either the bcr-abl translocation or t(5; 12) (q 33;p 13) in any patient. Screening of exons encoding the intracellular catalytic domains and extracellular ligand binding domains of PDGFR (exons 2 - 23) and c-kit (exons 1 - 21) in 6 patients demonstrated mostly previously known polymorphisms. At a median follow-up of 17 weeks (range, 10 - 33 weeks), 2 patients with HES and 1 with eos-CMD have achieved complete clinical remission and 1 additional patient with HES has achieved a partial remission. In contrast to previous observations, all 4 responding patients had elevated serum interleukin- 5 levels. Although the drug was well tolerated in most patients, a previously unrecognized treatment toxicity of acute left ventricular dysfunction occurred in a <b>responding</b> <b>patient</b> with HES within the first week of treatment. Myocardial biopsy revealed eosinophilic infiltration and degranulation, and the cardiogenic shock was reversed with the prompt institution of corticosteroid therapy...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To study {{distribution}} and toxicity of cyto-lytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) against a single melanoma epitope. Patients and Methods: CD 8 T cells obtained by leu-kapheresis from 10 patients with disseminated HLA-A 2. 1, tyrosinase-positive melanomas were immu-nized in vitro against tyrosinase 369 - 377 (YMNGTMSQV). Drosophila cells transduced with HLA-A 2. 1, CD 80, and CD 54 (intracellular adhesion molecule- 1) {{were used for}} priming, followed by two rounds of immunization with mononuclear cells as antigen-presenting cells. 1 108 CTL were infused intravenously (IV) on day 1. CTL fre-quency was measured by limiting dilutions in five pa-tients. 111 In labeling and scintigraphy measured distri-bution of CTL in next five. Five days later, 1 108 CTLs were infused on 4 successive days to both groups. Immunohistology of response was judged by biopsies. Results: Infusions were nontoxic. CTLs were unde-tectable in the blood, going to lungs within 5 minutes. At 4, 24, and 72 hours, they were found in liver and spleen. Lesions were visualized by scintiscans in one <b>responding</b> <b>patient</b> where two subcutaneous nodules were noted at 4 and 24 hours. A second patient had a partial response and remains alive with disease 2 years later. CD 8 T cells were found in lesions of responders, associated {{with the presence of}} HLA-A 2 molecules and tyrosinase. Two nonresponders without tyrosinase and HLA-A 2 molecules had a paucity of CD 8 T cells in their lesions. Whether the CD 8 T cells in lesions of respond-ers were those we had reinfused is uncertain. Conclusion: CTLs immunized against a single mela-noma epitope were nontoxic but did not specifically localize to tumor sites. Nevertheless, two patients had disease regression. Additional therapeutic studies with specifically immunized CTL seem justified...|$|E
40|$|HIV {{infection}} predisposes {{a person}} to fungal infections because of failure in the host's cell-mediated immunity, which {{may result in a}} variety of fungal infections (1, 2). Candidiasis is commonly caused by Candida albicans which can become a multi-system problem affecting the patient's nails, mouth, oesophagus, lower gastrointestinal tract, genitalia and rectum. Candida oesophagitis is a condition diagnostic of AIDS and characterised by erythematous lesions, pseudomembranous areas and/or ulcerations of the oesophagus. The condition may cause difficulty in swallowing, retrosternal pain, nausea and vomiting. Significant weight loss may also develop secondary to the characteristic symptoms of oesophageal candidiasis (3). Reports to date suggest therapy failure, incomplete response and decreasing susceptibility to azole medications such as ketoconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole (4). Whilst amphotericin remains the standard treatment for systemic or resistant mycoses (1), hospital experience with amphotericin toxicity may be a limiting factor against initiating homebased therapy (1). We report the outcomes for a clinically <b>responding</b> <b>patient</b> with a falling CD 4 count diagnosed with oesophageal candidiasis receiving intravenous amphotericin at home for a continuous seventeen month period. This case fulfils current definitions of long-term survival (5, 6). The patient initially presented over three years previously with HIV-related thrombocytopenia, a diagnosis made after counselling and HIV antibody testing showed HIV infection. Over successive years the patient received out-patient follow up including quarterly CD 4 monitoring, treatment with Zidovudine, prophylaxis with Cotrimoxazole against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, psychological counselling, oral and dental, care and social welfare interventions. The out-patient service included written information for the patient's General Medical Practitioner after each out-patient visit, on patient request. On presentation with oesophageal candidiasis due to Candida albicans three years later, the patient requested homebased care in association with the General Medical Practitioner (GP) {{and the rest of the}} primary healthcare team. The patient wished to keep hospital stays and out-patient visits to a minimum. The blood results for the patient's serum creatinine, urea and potassium are shown in Figures 1 - 3, respectively, for a total period of seventeen months during which amphotericin was administered. The data covers both the two week period of hospital based induction therapy and the following seventeen months of homebased maintenance therapy...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 44 women with {{advanced}} breast cancer who had failed first- and second-line chemotherapy were given combination chemotherapy consisting of folinic acid (FA), 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) and mitomycin C (MMC). The treatment schedule was: 200 mg/m 2 FA and 400 mg/m 2 5 -FU given i. v. over 2 h for 5 days plus 5 mg/m 2 MMC given i. v. on days 3 - 5; in 19 patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 3 - 4 and bone marrow depression, the MMC dose was 3 mg/m 2 given i. v. on days 3 - 5. In all, 41 patients were evaluable for response; 15 had a partial remission (PR), 18 had stable disease (SD), and 8 showed progressive disease (PD). The median response duration was 6 months and the median survival was 10 months. Toxicity was mild and consisted mainly of stomatitis, diarrhea, and leukopenia. A rapid improvement in performance status was noted in <b>responding</b> <b>patients.</b> A striking {{result was the}} reduction of analgesics in most cases and their complete withdrawal in <b>responding</b> <b>patients.</b> This combination chemotherapy achieved satisfactory effectiveness and improved {{the quality of life}} of patient...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} in vivo and in vitro parameters of cellular immunity in ten patients with cartilage hair hypoplasia, CHH. All ten patients displayed a negative skin test to 1 Tu tuberculin, eight <b>patients</b> did not <b>respond</b> to 10 Tu and seven {{not even to}} 100 Tu. Six patients were skin test-negative to 1 : 50 oidiomycin; and three were negative to even 1 : 10 oidiomycin. The absolute and relative distribution of blood T lymphocytes was normal. The absolute distribution of blood B lymphocytes was slightly decreased in three patients, but all patients had normal levels of IgM, IgG and IgA. Major changes were observed in the proliferative responses of blood leucocytes to mitogens and antigens. Five <b>patients</b> <b>responded</b> suboptimally to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), two to concanavalin A, three patients were hyporesponsive to Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I bacteria, six to tuberculin (PPD) and six to oidiomycin. The in vitro responses of two patients were entirely normal.
