30|$|In the {{mechanical}} part, the float moves {{up and down}} driven by waves, pulling pulley 2 and pulley 3 to rotate in opposite directions. During the wave falling period, only pulley 2, <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> 1 and driving pulley 4 work to drive the driving pulley 6. If the rotating speed of pulley 2 is {{equal to that of}} driving pulley 4 and the wave keeps falling, the connection between pulley 2 and driving pulley 4 is maintained by <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> 1. Similarly, during the wave rising period, only pulley 3, <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> 2 and driving pulley 5 work to drive the driving pulley 6. When pulley 3 keeps pace with driving pulley 5 through <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> 2 and the driving force is continually on pulley 3, the SRG rotating speed will increase. Through this process, the wave energy is captured and converted into mechanical energy. One thing to be noted is that two <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheels</b> ensure the rotor of SRG rotates in single direction during the whole process. The torque applied on the rotor is always negative, whether wave rises or falls. The work efficiency is greatly improved, compared with that of a single-direction driven float-type wave power system, which works only when the wave is rising, or only when it is falling.|$|R

Examination revealed that the <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> failed in progressive manner wherein a number of cracks had initiated all along the circumference of the nut at the fillet of the flange.

In general, the microstructure of the nut material was found to be satisfactory and the composition was found to conform to the specification.

50|$|Loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> {{indicators}} are small pointed tags, usually made of fluorescent orange or yellow plastic, which are {{fixed to the}} lug <b>nuts</b> of the <b>wheels</b> of large vehicles. The tag rotates with the nut, and if the nut becomes loose, {{the point of the}} tag shifts noticeably out of alignment with the other tags. If too many lug nuts are loosened, the wheel can detach from the wheel stud; loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> indicators allow identification of loose nuts before this can occur.|$|R

30|$|The float {{moves with}} {{vertical}} motion under the excitation force from waves {{and the force}} F f transmitted through the supporting cable. Then the oscillatory rotation of the input shafts occurs. Two <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheels</b> and driving pulleys are used to convert these oscillatory rotations to the unidirectional rotation output shaft, which is then geared up to drive the SRG.|$|R
50|$|A lug <b>nut</b> or <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> is a fastener, {{specifically}} a nut, used {{to secure}} a wheel on a vehicle. Typically, lug nuts are found on automobiles, trucks (lorries), and other large vehicles using rubber tires.|$|R

5000|$|A {{peanut butter}} wrench, {{also known as}} a crank bolt spanner or a crank spanner, is a {{single-ended}} box wrench or ring spanner used in cycling to tighten older 14 mm and 15 mm crank bolts, or the <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> (track nuts) on hubs with solid axles commonly found on track bicycles, particularly the 15 mm wrench made by Campagnolo. This is the only one-piece wrench {{that can be used to}} tighten or loosen the bolt or nut which holds the crank to a square-taper bottom bracket spindle (although a thin-walled 15 mm socket and handle will also serve), whereas any wrench/spanner of the correct size will tighten or loosen <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R

The dynamic model for the bidirectional driven float-type wave power generation system has been demonstrated in a wave-generation system for the mechanical part and MATLAB for the electrical energy conversion. This has proved that the proposed system has high efficiency and good prospect of application in real wave conditions.|$|R

50|$|Ratchet mechanism, which {{prevents}} the spool from rotating {{when there is}} tension on the line. this prevents inadvertent unreeling of line, as the ratchet lever must {{be held in the}} open position to allow unwinding. The ratchet mechanism is usually a <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> on the spool which engages with a spring-loaded pawl which can either be held open by a trigger lever, or clipped open by a knob or lever on the handle. The ratchet allows the spool to be manually rotated to wind in line when engaged.|$|R

A scooter with yellow wheels {{in the shape of}} a green caterpillar wearing a yellow hat, the Inchworm was jointed under the saddle so its wheelbase could expand and contract. The wheels were constricted by a ratchet mechanism to rotating forward. As the rider bounced up and down on the saddle, the toy moved forward in a way somewhat resembling a Geometer caterpillar, with the <b>ratcheting</b> <b>wheels</b> making a clicking sound.|$|R

5000|$|In 1843 MatthÃ¤us Hipp first {{mentioned}} a purely mechanical clock {{being driven by}} a switch called [...] "echappement Ã  palette". A varied version of that escapement has been used from the 1860s inside electrically driven pendulum clocks, the so-called [...] "hipp-toggle". Since the 1870s in an improved version the pendulum drove a <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> via a pawl on the pendulum rod, and the <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> drove {{the rest of the}} clock train to indicate the time. The pendulum was not impelled on every swing or even at a set interval of time. It was only impelled when its arc of swing had decayed below a certain level. As well as the counting pawl, the pendulum carried a small vane, known as a Hipp's toggle, pivoted at the top, which was completely free to swing. It was placed so that it dragged across a triangular polished block with a vee-groove in the top of it. When the arc of swing of the pendulum was large enough, the vane crossed the groove and swung free on the other side. If the arc was too small the vane never left {{the far side of the}} groove, and when the pendulum swung back it pushed the block strongly downwards. The block carried a contact which completed the circuit to the electromagnet which impelled the pendulum. The pendulum was only impelled as required.|$|R
