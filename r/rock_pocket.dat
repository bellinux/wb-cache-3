50|$|Historically, <b>rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mice {{have been}} {{subdivided}} into {{as many as}} ten subspecies (Benson 1933; Dice and Blossom 1937) based on geographical distribution and coat colour. Most <b>rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mouse populations have light, tawny fur consistent with the colour of the desert rocks on which they live. However, darker coloured <b>rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mice are found living amid black, basaltic rock formations.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, {{scientists}} sampled DNA {{from both}} light- and dark-coloured <b>rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mice from areas in Pinacate Peaks, Mexico and New Mexico, USA. In the Pinacate mice, they discovered a perfect association between {{different versions of}} the Melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc41r6) gene and coat colour [...] Subsequent studies demonstrated that there is strong selective pressure maintaining Mc1r allele and coat colour frequencies across the short geographic distances between the light- and dark-coloured rock islands. Thus melanism in <b>rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mice is considered a fabulous example of adaptation by natural selection. Changes in the Mc1r gene sequence are not responsible for the colour difference in the mice sampled from New Mexico, however, leading the researchers to conclude that the almost identical dark coat colours developed multiple times in <b>rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mice, an example of convergent evolution.|$|E

50|$|C. pernix mostly {{lives in}} the coastal plain of Sinaloa state within Mexico, which extends from Southern Sonora to Northern Nayarit. Their habitat {{consists}} mostly of small trees, shrubs, and cacti. Sinaloan pocket mice are found on sandy soil, living under low bushes or dense networks of vines and grasses. Their habitat does not contain any rock material, unlike in its sister species, the <b>rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mouse.|$|E
50|$|Found {{mainly in}} rocky {{outcrops}} in {{the deserts of}} the southwestern United States and Mexico, the <b>rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mouse is medium-sized (length ~18 cm, weight ~12-18g) and nocturnal. It eats mainly plant seeds and makes small burrows in soil close to or under rocks to evade owls, its main predator. The breeding season spans a few months, starting in February or March, and the litter size is typically between three and six. As with most pocket mice, the tail is longer than the body (~10 cm).|$|E
50|$|Chihuahuan {{pocket mice}} are {{moderately}} sized rodents, {{with a total}} adult length of 16 to 18 cm, including the tail, and weighing 15 to 23 g. The fur is buff sprinkled with black over the back and sides, and white on the tail and underparts. The hairs on the rump are long and slender, {{but there are no}} spines, such as are present on the otherwise very similar <b>rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mouse.

50|$|Concealment {{offers a}} large {{selective}} advantage for pocket mice that {{are able to}} successfully hide from potential predators, also known as Crypsis. Pocket mice generally show two forms of crypsis: camouflage and countershading. Camouflage is seen when an organism's coloring helps it blend into its background or environment. Evidence of camouflage is seen between different populations of pocket mice that live in two different environments. The Sinaloan pocket mouse usually has a yellow-brown coat with black hairs because they live in a sandy environment under shrubs, while the <b>Rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mouse usually has a grey or black coat color and lives among rocks. Mice who show a very different coat color than their environment are more susceptible to predation because they can be seen easier than mice that blend in with their environment. Countershading is another type of camouflage and is seen when an organism's pigmentation is darker on the upper side of the body and lighter {{on the underside of the}} body. Sinaloan pocket mice almost always have a lighter belly and sides compared to the darker color of their back. The selective advantage of this color patterning is again, concealment from predators, mostly owls in this case. Countershading helps the pocket mouse to reduce the appearance of their shadow in sunny environments. Living in the sunny desert, this color pattern has a large selective advantage. Mice whose shadows were easily seen by owls flying overhead would more likely become prey, than mice whose shadows weren't as obvious.|$|E
40|$|Identifying {{the genes}} {{underlying}} adaptation {{is a major}} challenge in evolutionary biology. Here, we describe the molecular changes underlying adaptive coat color variation in a natural population of <b>rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mice, Chaetodipus intermedius. <b>Rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mice are generally light-colored and live on light-colored rocks. However, populations of dark (melanic) mice are found on dark lava, and this concealing coloration provides protection from avian and mammalian predators. We conducted association studies by using markers in candidate pigmentation genes and discovered four mutations in the melanocortin- 1 -receptor gene, Mc 1 r, {{that seem to be}} responsible for adaptive melanism in one population of lava-dwelling pocket mice. Interestingly, another melanic population of these mice on a different lava flow shows no association with Mc 1 r mutations, indicating that adaptive dark color has evolved independently in this species through changes at different genes...|$|E
40|$|Two recent {{papers on}} the {{molecular}} basis of melan-ism strengthen the chain of evidence linking geno-type and phenotype in nature. Research on coat colour polymorphisms in <b>rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mice from differently coloured rock substrates provides a com-pelling example of the genetics of adaptation and the serendipitous nature of darwinian selection. Mutations in one gene, melanocortin- 1 -receptor, are perfectly associated with dark coat colour on black lava. Comparative sequence analysis shows that the same gene is involved in melanic polymorphism in some cats. Melanism is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the animal kingdom and has long been used to investigate evolution-ary change [1]. The melanic forms of peppered moth...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to monitor small mammal diversity, {{intersite}} variation, and seasonal fluctuations in population in four microhabitat plots at Indio Mountains Research Station, Hudspeth County, Texas. The survey began in July 2003 and lasted through July 2004 with nine sampling dates over the four seasons. One-hectare plots were established in four sampling areas which exhibit different substrates and vegetation types. The site with the highest number and greatest species diversity of small mammals captured over the four seasons was Agate Hill. It is composed of igneous rock and contains the greatest amount and most diverse vegetation of the four sites. The Echo Canyon site, characterized by rocky Cretaceous limestone and low plant diversity, showed the lowest number of captures {{as well as the}} lowest species diversity. A total of five species of small mammals were captured. The <b>rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mouse (Chaetodipus intermedius) was most frequently captured, followed by Merriam 2 ̆ 7 s kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami). Winter was the most successful season, with the greatest total number of animals captured from the combined sites, while spring had the fewest captures. Each species favored different seasons, C. intermedius was most frequently captured during the summer, whereas D. merriami and P. eremicus were both captured in greater numbers in the fall and winter. Ammospermophilus interpres was captured once during the fall, winter, and spring at both Agate Hill and Snail Hill Draw. Neotoma leucodon was captured only once at Agate Hill, and that was during winter. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Patterns of {{geographic}} variation in phenotype or genotype may {{provide evidence for}} natural selection. Here, we compare phenotypic variation in color, allele frequencies of a pigmentation gene (the melanocortin- 1 receptor, Mc 1 r), and patterns of neutral mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in <b>rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mice (Chaetodipus intermedius) across a habitat gradient in southern Arizona. Pocket mice inhabiting volcanic lava have dark coats with unbanded, uniformly melanic hairs, whereas mice from nearby light-colored granitic rocks have light coats with banded hairs. This color polymorphism is a presumed adaptation to avoid predation. Previous work has demonstrated that two Mc 1 r alleles, D and d, differ by four amino acids, and {{are responsible for the}} color polymorphism: DD and Dd genotypes are melanic whereas dd genotypes are light colored. To determine the frequency of the two Mc 1 r allelic classes across the dark-colored lava and neighboring light-colored granite, we sequenced the Mc 1 r gene in 175 individuals from a 35 -km transect in the Pinacate lava region. We also sequenced two neutral mtDNA genes, COIII and ND 3, in the same individuals. We found a strong correlation between Mc 1 r allele frequency and habitat color and no correlation between mtDNA markers and habitat color. Using estimates of migration from mtDNA haplotypes between dark- and light-colored sampling sites and Mc 1 r allele frequencies at each site, we estimated selection coefficients against mismatched Mc 1 r alleles, assuming a simple model of migration-selection balance. Habitat-dependent selection appears strong but asymmetric: selection is stronger against light mice on dark rock than against melanic mice on light rock...|$|E
40|$|Species often encounter, {{and adapt}} to, many patches of similar {{environmental}} conditions across their range. Such adaptation can occur through convergent evolution if different alleles arise in different patches, {{or through the}} spread of shared alleles by migration acting to synchronize adaptation across the species. The {{tension between the two}} reflects the constraint imposed on evolution by the underlying genetic architecture versus how effectively selection and geographic isolation act to inhibit the geographic spread of locally adapted alleles. This paper studies the balance between these two routes to adaptation in a model of continuous environments with patchy selection pressures. We address the following questions: How long does it take for a novel allele to appear in a patch where it is locally adapted through mutation? Or, through migration from another, already adapted patch? Which is more likely to occur, as a function of distance between the patches? What population genetic signal is left by the spread of migrant alleles? To answer these questions we examine the family structure underlying migration-selection equilibrium surrounding an already adapted patch, treating those rare families that reach new patches as spatial branching processes. A main result is that patches further apart than a critical distance will likely evolve independent locally adapted alleles; this distance is proportional to the spatial scale of selection ([Formula: see text], where σ is the dispersal distance and sm is the selective disadvantage of these alleles between patches), and depends linearly on log(sm/μ), where μ is the mutation rate. This provides a way to understand the role of geographic separation between patches in promoting convergent adaptation and the genomic signals it leaves behind. We illustrate these ideas using the convergent evolution of cryptic coloration in the <b>rock</b> <b>pocket</b> mouse, Chaetodipus intermedius, as an empirical example...|$|E

50|$|The Langur {{lives in}} a moist {{tropical}} rain forest on limestone hills, a type of habitat used by 6-7 other genera of the T. francoisi group found elsewhere in Vietnam. During the summer the weather is warm, and rainy with temperatures averaging 25 °C. In the winter, it is usually cold with little rain and high temperatures averaging less than 20 °C. Because there are no rivers and streams and no permanent freshwater ponds on the Cat Ba Island the langurs take their moisture from rainwater caught in <b>rock</b> <b>pockets</b> and contained in vegetation. Temporary surface streams form briefly during rainy season, rapidly receding into caves and subterranean passages.. The soil {{is derived from the}} erosion of the native limestone bedrock, and organic detritus from the vegetation. The Cat Ba langurs live in groups, usually one male with several females and their offspring. Each group has its own territory, defended by the adult male who also initiates the location of the group. The females usually give birth to a single baby every 2-3 years, which becomes mature at 4-6 years old. Langurs have an average life expectancy of 25 years. The environment provides an arborous and terrestrial habitat for langurs as well as well as meeting the needs of their folivorous diet. Food mainly consists of leaves, but also fresh shoots, flowers, bark, and some fruits. The leaves make up over 70% of the langur's diet.|$|R
