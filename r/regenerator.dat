Many small 'toy' Stirling engines, particularly low-temperature difference (LTD) types, {{do not have a}} distinct <b>regenerator</b> component and might be considered hot air engines; however a small amount of regeneration is provided by the surface of the displacer itself and the nearby cylinder wall, or similarly the passage connecting the hot and cold cylinders of an alpha configuration engine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Agile all optical {{switches}} (OXC) currently use {{an architecture}} in which <b>regenerators</b> and transceivers have preassigned fixed directionality. However, technology is evolving to enable new OXC architectures {{in which the}} directionality of <b>regenerators</b> and transceivers can be dynamically assigned on demand. In this paper, we quantify the performance and cost benefits of <b>regenerators</b> and transceivers with dynamically assignable directionality. We show that fewer <b>regenerators</b> and transceivers need {{to be used with}} the new architecture because of sharing of resources across all directionality combinations. This translates to significant cost savings for the new architecture, especially as the traffic load in the network increases.

25|$|A Stirling {{engine is}} a heat engine that {{operates}} by cyclic compression {{and expansion of}} air or other gas (the working fluid) at different temperatures, such {{that there is a}} net conversion of heat energy to mechanical work. More specifically, the Stirling engine is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine with a permanently gaseous working fluid. Closed-cycle, in this context, means a thermodynamic system in which the working fluid is permanently contained within the system, and regenerative describes the use of a specific type of internal heat exchanger and thermal store, known as the <b>regenerator.</b> The inclusion of a <b>regenerator</b> differentiates the Stirling engine from other closed cycle hot air engines.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{imperfections}} in the fiber, light degrades as it {{is transmitted}} through it. For distances greater than 100 kilometres, either amplifiers or <b>regenerators</b> need to be deployed.

25|$|The attack {{occurred}} after a progressive {{decline of the}} Portuguese political system, effective since the Regeneration, due {{in part by the}} political erosion originated from the system of rotating governments (which saw the Progressive Party and <b>Regenerator</b> Party alternating in government). The king, as arbiter of the system, a role attributed to him by the Constitution, had designated João Franco {{as the president of the}} Council of Ministers (government chief). João Franco, dissident of the <b>Regenerator</b> Party, convinced the king to dissolve the parliament so that he could implement a series of measures with the aim to moralise Portuguese politics. This decision irritated not only the republican but also the monarchical opposition, led by political rivals of Franco who accused him of governing in dictatorship. The events were aggravated by the issues of the advanced payments to the Royal House and the signing of the decree of 30 January 1908 that foresaw the banishment to the colonies, without judgement, of those involved in a failed republican coup occurred two days previously, the Municipal Library Elevator Coup.|$|E
25|$|Lubricants {{can also}} clog heat exchangers, {{especially}} the <b>regenerator.</b> For these reasons, designers prefer non-lubricated, low-coefficient of friction materials (such as rulon or graphite), with low normal {{forces on the}} moving parts, especially for sliding seals. Some designs avoid sliding surfaces altogether by using diaphragms for sealed pistons. These {{are some of the}} factors that allow Stirling engines to have lower maintenance requirements and longer life than internal-combustion engines.|$|E
25|$|The design {{challenge}} for a Stirling engine <b>regenerator</b> {{is to provide}} sufficient heat transfer capacity without introducing too much additional internal volume ('dead space') or flow resistance. These inherent design conflicts are one of many factors that limit the efficiency of practical Stirling engines. A typical design is a stack of fine metal wire meshes, with low porosity to reduce dead space, and with the wire axes perpendicular to the gas flow to reduce conduction in that direction and to maximize convective heat transfer.|$|E

This study follows the current trend in optical networking industry by utilizing extension of IP control protocols. Dynamic routing algorithms, aware of current regeneration resources and link states, are designed to smartly route the connection requests under quality constraints. A hierarchical network model, supported by the MPLS-based control plane, is also proposed to provide scalability.

25|$|A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a {{multistage}} evaporative cooler. The air {{is passed}} through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, {{and that can be}} done economically with a low temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50°F (28°C), and still control humidity. If the brine <b>regenerator</b> uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.|$|E
25|$|For {{gasification}} applications, or IGCC, {{the plant}} modifications required {{to add the}} ability to capture CO2 are minimal. The syngas produced by the gasifiers needs to be treated through various processes {{for the removal of}} impurities already in the gas stream, so all that is required to remove CO2 is to add the necessary equipment, an absorber and <b>regenerator,</b> to this process train. In combustion applications, modifications must be done to the exhaust stack and because of the lower concentrations of CO2 present in the exhaust, much larger volumes of total gas require processing, necessitating larger and more expensive equipment.|$|E
25|$|For the Carnot cycle, or its equivalent, {{the average}} value TH will equal the highest {{temperature}} available, namely TH, and TC the lowest, namely TC.

This can help illustrate, for example, why a reheater or a <b>regenerator</b> can improve the thermal efficiency of steam power plants—and why the thermal efficiency of combined-cycle power plants (which incorporate gas turbines operating at even higher temperatures) exceeds that of conventional steam plants.

40|$|Abstract—Advances in the {{development}} of colorless and nondirectional reconfigurable optical add–drop multi-plexers (ROADMs) enable flexible predeployment of optoelectronic <b>regenerators</b> (reshaping, retiming, and reamplifying known as 3 R) in future optical networks. Compared to the current practice of installing a regenera-tor only when a circuit needs them, predeployment of <b>regenerators</b> in specific sites will allow service providers to achieve rapid provisioning such as bandwidth-on-demand service and fast restoration. Concentrating the predeployment of <b>regenerators</b> in a subset of ROADM sites will achieve high utilization and reduces the network operational costs.

50|$|It {{follows that}} to {{calculate}} latency of a connection, {{one has to}} know the distance traveled by the fibre, which is rarely a straight line, since it has to traverse geographic contours and obstacles, such as roads and railway tracks, {{as well as other}} rights-of-way. Due to imperfections in the fibre, light degrades as it is transmitted through it. For distances of greater than 100 kilometers, either amplifiers or <b>regenerators</b> need to be deployed. Passive amplifiers typically add less latency than <b>regenerators,</b> at the cost of compounding attenuation, though in both cases it can be highly variable, and so needs to be taken into account. In particular, legacy spans are more likely to make use of higher latency <b>regenerators.</b>|$|R
25|$|In a Stirling engine, the <b>regenerator</b> is an {{internal}} heat exchanger and temporary heat store placed between the {{hot and cold}} spaces such that the working fluid passes through it first in one direction then the other, taking heat from the fluid in one direction, and returning it in the other. It {{can be as simple}} as metal mesh or foam, and benefits from high surface area, high heat capacity, low conductivity and low flow friction. Its function is to retain within the system that heat that would otherwise be exchanged with the environment at temperatures intermediate to the maximum and minimum cycle temperatures, thus enabling the thermal efficiency of the cycle (though not of any practical engine) to approach the limiting Carnot efficiency.|$|E
500|$|For example, {{given the}} {{equatorial}} circumference of the Earth is about [...] and c about , the theoretical shortest {{time for a}} piece of information to travel half the globe along the surface is about 67 milliseconds. When light is travelling around the globe in an optical fibre, the actual transit time is longer, in part because the speed of light is slower by about 35% in an optical fibre, depending on its refractive index n. Furthermore, straight lines rarely occur in global communications situations, and delays are created when the signal passes through an electronic switch or signal <b>regenerator.</b>|$|E
