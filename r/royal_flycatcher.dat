50|$|The Amazonian <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Onychorhynchus coronatus coronatus) is a {{passerine}} bird of {{the tyrant}} flycatcher family. Depending on authority, {{it is often}} considered the nominate subspecies of the single widespread <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> or considered a species closely related to three other royal flycatchers, the northern <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> the Pacific <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> and the Atlantic <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Amazonian <b>royal</b> <b>flycatchers</b> {{are about}} [...] {{inches in length}} and like to dart out from {{branches}} to catch flying insects or snap them up from leaves. They build very large nests (sometimes up to 6 feet long) on branches near water. The nest hangs over the water which {{makes it hard for}} predators to reach.|$|R

50|$|Thirty Flycatcher {{systems were}} {{supplied}} to the Royal Netherlands Army under a contract placed in early 1987. Production, which commenced immediately, result ed {{in the first}} units being delivered in April 1989. Deliveries were completed within 36 months. The <b>Royal</b> Netherlands Army <b>Flycatchers</b> are used in combination with modified Bofors 40L70 guns.|$|R
50|$|The Atlantic <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher</b> is {{endemic to}} Atlantic forest in {{south-eastern}} Brazil. It {{is threatened by}} habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Onychorhynchus coronatus swainsoni) is {{a bird in}} {{the family}} Tyrannidae. It is often {{considered}} a subspecies of Onychorhynchus coronatus.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher</b> {{is usually}} inconspicuous and quiet, but sometimes gives a repeated sharp clear pree-o or key-up, sounding {{rather like a}} Manacus manakin or a jacamar.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher</b> is 16.5-18 cm (6Â½-7") long, brown above small buffy {{spots on}} its wing-coverts; the rump and tail are tawny-ochraceous in colour. The bill {{is long and}} broad.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher</b> has an erectile fan-shaped crest, coloured red in {{the male}} and yellow-orange in the female. The display with the crest fully raised is seen extremely rarely, except during banding sessions.|$|E
50|$|The Pacific <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Onychorhynchus coronatus occidentalis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Tyrannidae. It is often {{considered}} a subspecies of Onychorhynchus coronatus. It is found in relatively dry forest and woodland in western Ecuador and far north-western Peru. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|The Amazonian <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher</b> {{is found}} in forest and {{woodland}} {{throughout most of the}} Amazon basin in northern Bolivia, eastern Peru, eastern Ecuador, eastern Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, and northern and western Brazil. It is easily overlooked and typically found in low densities, but overall it remains widespread and common. It is therefore considered to be of least concern by BirdLife International.|$|E
50|$|About 520 {{bird species}} have been {{reported}} in the park including: the blue-headed macaw, Spix's guan, the bat falcon, the red-bellied macaw, the sunbittern, the spangled cotinga, the king vulture, the white-necked jacobin, Chapman's swift, the ocellated poorwill, the pygmy antwren, the white-throated toucan, the jabiru, the golden-tailed sapphire, the Amazon kingfisher, the harpy eagle, the red-necked woodpecker, the scarlet macaw, the Amazonian <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> etc.|$|E
50|$|The royal flycatchers are {{birds in}} the genus Onychorhynchus in the Tityridae family {{according}} to the IOC. Other taxonomic authorities including the AOU, Clements, and the IUCN, include it in Tyrannidae. Depending on authority, it includes a single widespread, or four more localized species. The specific epithet of the type species, coronatus, and the common name of all the species in this genus, <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> refer to the striking, colourful crest, which is seen displayed very rarely, except after mating, while preening, in courtship {{as well as being}} handled.|$|E
50|$|Species that {{frequent}} {{the coastal}} mountains or {{southern part of}} the ecoregion include pale-browed tinamou (Crypturellus transfasciatus), rufous-headed chachalaca (Ortalis erythroptera), ochre-bellied dove (Leptotila ochraceiventris), great green macaw (Ara ambiguus), red-masked parakeet (Psittacara erythrogenys), grey-cheeked parakeet (Brotogeris pyrrhoptera), Esmeraldas woodstar (Chaetocercus berlepschi), little woodstar (Chaetocercus bombus), Watkins's antpitta (Grallaria watkinsi), blackish-headed spinetail (Synallaxis tithys), henna-hooded foliage-gleaner (Clibanornis erythrocephalus), Pacific <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Onychorhynchus coronatus occidentalis), grey-breasted flycatcher (Lathrotriccus griseipectus), slaty becard (Pachyramphus spodiurus) and saffron siskin (Spinus siemiradzkii).Species found elsewhere include pale-headed brush finch (Atlapetes pallidiceps), rufous-necked foliage-gleaner (Syndactyla ruficollis), black-eared hemispingus (Hemispingus melanotis), grey-headed antbird (Myrmeciza griseiceps), black-cowled saltator (Saltator nigriceps) and bay-crowned brush finch (Atlapetes seebohmi).|$|E
5000|$|Most, but not all, {{species are}} rather plain, with various hues of brown, gray and white commonplace. Obvious {{exceptions}} include {{the bright red}} vermilion flycatcher, blue, black, white and yellow many-colored rush-tyrant and some species of tody-flycatchers or tyrants, which are often yellow, black, white and/or rufous, from the Todirostrum, Hemitriccus and Poecilotriccus genera. Several species have bright yellow underparts, from the ornate flycatcher to the great kiskadee. Some species have erectile crests. The crest is taken to the extreme in the <b>royal</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> which is plain but for a large black-spotted, red-and-blue crest which it fans out like a peafowl tail when excited. Several of the large genera (i.e. Elaenia, Myiarchus or Empidonax) are quite difficult to tell apart in the field due to similar plumage and some are best distinguished by their voices. Behaviorally they can vary from species such as spadebills which are tiny, shy and live in dense forest interiors to kingbirds, which are relatively large, bold, inquisitive and often inhabit open areas near human habitations. As the name implies, a great majority of tyrant flycatchers are entirely insectivorous (though not necessarily specialized in flies). Tyrant flycatchers are largely opportunistic feeders and often catch any flying or arboreal insect they encounter. However, food can vary greatly and some (like the large great kiskadee) will eat fruit or small vertebrates (e.g. small frogs). In North America, most species {{are associated with a}} [...] "sallying" [...] feeding style, where they fly up to catch an insect directly from their perch and then immediately return to the same perch. Most tropical species however do not feed in this fashion and several types prefer to glean insects from leaves and bark. Tropical species are sometimes found in mixed-species foraging flocks, where various types of passerines and other smallish birds are found feeding in proximity.|$|E
