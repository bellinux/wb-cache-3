40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} is to investigate the fatigue behaviour of friction stir (FS) welded tubular joints in aluminium alloy subjected to torsional fatigue loading. To manufacture the samples which were tested, an MTS I-STIR process development system was equipped with a <b>retracting</b> <b>tool</b> specifically designed for these tubular welds. Al 6082 -T 6 FS welded samples were tested under cyclic torsion with a nominal shear stress ratio equal to- 1 and 0. The test data show that, strictly speaking, the presence of non-zero mean shear stresses has a detrimental effect on the overall torsional fatigue strength of the FS welded joints. However, the reanalysis discussed in the present paper suggests that, from a statistical point of view, any detrimental effect is small. This means that fatigue assessment under torsional fatigue loading of these FS welded tubular connections can be performed with little loss of accuracy by neglecting the presence of non-zero mean shear stresses...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a semi-automated friction stir welding (FSW) technique for joining 38  mm nominal outer diameter (OD) tubes of 6082 -T 6 aluminium alloy with 3. 5  mm nominal wall thickness. The technique incorporates a <b>retracting</b> <b>tool</b> in order to avoid leaving a substantial hole in the joint line after extracting the tool {{at the end of the}} welding process. This is one of very first applications of FSW to small diameter tubular geometries to be reported in the open literature and the technique is capable of producing small-scale production runs (circa 100) of welded tube specimens with consistent tensile and fatigue properties. The tensile strength of the extruded 6082 -T 6 tube was 303  MPa while the joint efficiency of the weld was 0. 55 both for complete tube specimens and for microtensile specimens. This compares well with values reported in the literature for 3  mm flat plate specimens of 6082 alloy...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports {{results of}} fatigue tests of {{friction}} stir welded (FSW) aluminium tubes. Relatively small 38 mm diameter tubes were used and hence an automated FSW process using a <b>retracting</b> <b>tool</b> {{was designed for}} this project, as the wall thickness of the aluminium tube {{was similar to the}} diameter of the FSW tool. This is a more complex joint geometry to weld than the more usual larger diameter tube reported in the literature. S-N fatigue testing was performed using load ratios of R = 0. 1 and R = - 1. Crack path analysis was performed using both low magnification stereo microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, in order to identify crack initiation sites and to determine the direction of crack propagation. Work is still in progress to follow the crack path through the various microstructural zones associated with the weld. A simple statistical analysis was used to characterize the most typical crack initiation site. This work forms part of a wider project directed at determining multiaxial fatigue design rules for small diameter 6082 -T 6 aluminium tubes that could be of use in the ground vehicle industry...|$|E

Here we describe a technique where, rather than using a separate <b>retracting</b> <b>tool,</b> a handheld Ojemann cortical stimulator was used to retract cerebral parenchyma while simultaneously stimulating descending white matter tracts to prevent accidental damage to white matter tracts involved with motor function. Case descriptionA 48 -year-old patient developed intractable seizures and preoperative workup showed a left frontal brain mass close to her motor region. Subdural grid electrodes were implanted to localize the patient's ictal onset zone. The electrodes were then removed and the tumor was resected along with the ictal onset zone. During the resection, the neurosurgeon (S. Vadera) successfully utilized the Ojemann cortical stimulator to stimulate descending white matter tracts to prevent accidental injury to the patient and also retract cerebral parenchyma during resection. Four weeks post-operative, the patient had made a complete recovery and had no unforeseen deficits or weaknesses. ConclusionHere we show that the Ojemann cortical stimulator {{can be used as}} an effective retraction tool as well as a cerebral parenchyma stimulator, effectively preventing accidental injury to functional tissue while concurrently giving the neurosurgeon a free hand to perform other tasks...|$|E

40|$|Friction stir welding is a {{solid state}} welding process {{developed}} and patented by The Welding Institute in Cambridge, England. Friction stir welding has been implemented in the aerospace industry in the fabrication of longitudinal welds in pressurized cryogenic propellant tanks. As the industry looks to implement friction stir welding in circumferential welds in pressurized cryogenic propellant tanks, techniques to close out the termination hole associated with <b>retracting</b> the pin <b>tool</b> are being evaluated. Friction pull plug welding is under development as a one means of closing out the termination hole. A friction pull plug weld placed in a friction stir weld results in a non-homogenous weld joint where the initial weld, plug weld, their respective heat affected zones and the base metal all interact. The welded joint is a composite, plastically deformed material system with a complex residual stress field. In order to address damage tolerance concerns associated with friction plug welds in safety critical structures, such as propellant tanks, nondestructive inspection and proof testing {{may be required to}} screen hardware for mission critical defects. The efficacy of the nondestructive evaluation or the proof test is based on an assessment of the critical flaw size in the test or service environments. Test data relating residual strength capability to flaw size in two aluminum alloy friction plug weld configurations is presented...|$|R
40|$|The iconic, orange {{external}} tank of {{the space}} shuttle launch system not only contains the fuel used by the shuttle s main engines during liftoff but also comprises the shuttle s backbone, supporting the space shuttle orbiter and solid rocket boosters. Given the tank s structural importance and the extreme forces (7. 8 million pounds of thrust load) and temperatures it encounters during launch, the welds used to construct the tank must be highly reliable. Variable polarity plasma arc welding, developed for manufacturing the external tank and later employed for building the International Space Station, was until 1994 the best process for joining the aluminum alloys used during construction. That year, Marshall Space Flight Center engineers began experimenting with a relatively new welding technique called friction stir welding (FSW), developed in 1991 by The Welding Institute, of Cambridge, England. FSW differs from traditional fusion welding in that it is a solid-state welding technique, using frictional heat and motion to join structural components without actually melting any of the material. The weld is created by a shouldered pin tool that is plunged into the seam of the materials to be joined. The tool traverses the line while rotating at high speeds, generating friction that heats and softens but does not melt the metal. (The heat produced approaches about 80 percent of the metal s melting temperature.) The pin tool s rotation crushes and stirs the plasticized metal, extruding it along the seam as the tool moves forward. The material cools and consolidates, resulting in a weld with superior mechanical properties as compared to those weld properties of fusion welds. The innovative FSW technology promises a number of attractive benefits. Because the welded materials are not melted, many of the undesirables associated with fusion welding porosity, cracking, shrinkage, and distortion of the weld are minimized or avoided. The process is more energy efficient, safe (no toxic smoke or shielding gas, liquid metal splatter, arcing, dangerous voltage, or radiation), and environmentally sound (no consumables, fumes, or noise) than fusion welding. Under computer control, an automated FSW machine can create welds with high reproducibility, improving efficiency and overall quality of manufactured materials. The process also allows for welding dissimilar metals as well as those metals considered to be "unweldable" such as the 7 xxx series aluminum alloys. Its effectiveness and versatility makes FSW useful for aerospace, rail, automotive, marine, and military applications. A downside to FSW, however, is the keyhole opening left in the weld when the FSW pin tool exits the weld joint. This is a significant problem when using the FSW process to join circumferential structures such as pipes and storage containers. Furthermore, weld joints that taper in material thickness also present problems when using the conventional FSW pin tool, because the threaded pin rotating within the weld joint material is a fixed length. There must be capability for the rotating pin to both increase and decrease in length in real time while welding the tapered material. (Both circumferential and tapered thickness weldments are found in the space shuttle external tank.) Marshall engineers addressed both the keyhole and tapered material thickness problems by developing the auto-adjustable pin tool. This unique piece of equipment automatically withdraws the pin into the tool s shoulder for keyhole closeout. In addition, the auto-adjustable pin <b>tool</b> <b>retracts,</b> or shortens, the rotating pin while welding a weld joint that tapers from one thickness to a thinner thickness. This year, the impact of the Marshall innovation was recognized with an "Excellence in Technology Transfer Award" from the Federal Laboratory Consortium...|$|R
