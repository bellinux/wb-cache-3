Older systems rely on a passive air circulation system where the greater density of cooler air causes it to sink into the furnace area below, through <b>air</b> <b>return</b> <b>registers</b> in the floor, and the lesser density of warmed air causes it to rise in the ductwork; the two forces acting together to drive air circulation in a system termed 'gravity-fed'. The layout of these 'octopus’ furnaces and their duct systems is optimized with various diameters of large dampered ducts.|$|R

Effective capacity and Energy Efficiency Ratio both decreased with increased <b>return</b> <b>air</b> leakage. However, power consumption was relatively constant for all variables except outdoor temperature, which meant that for the same power consumption, the unit delivered much lower performance when there was <b>return</b> <b>air</b> leakage.

Through a combination of on-line real-time modeling and hardware actuation, LEUs are able to mimic the dynamics of a variety of cooling loads. A virtual container model simulates the thermal dynamics of the cooled space and determines the appropriate <b>return</b> <b>air</b> temperature to the evaporator for a given application. The LEU uses an actuated slide to mix warm <b>return</b> <b>air</b> with colder supply air to track the desired <b>return</b> <b>air</b> temperature from the model. Depending on the physical design of the LEU, control of the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> temperature may become difficult due to non-monotonic and nonlinear dynamics. The presented LEU design achieves monotonic and nearly linear dynamics between the actuation mechanism and the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> temperature, allowing for a simple yet robust controller to be designed for the system. The experimental implementation of the ME-LEU on a dual evaporator AC 2 ̆ 6 R system permits independent loading of each evaporator, thereby increasing the emulation capabilities to a larger set of real world systems...|$|R

When an air-to-air heat pipe heat exchanger is placed between the warm <b>return</b> <b>air</b> and cold supply air streams {{of an air}} conditioner, heat is efficiently transferred from the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> to the supply air. As the warm <b>return</b> <b>air</b> precools during this process, it moves closer to its dew-point temperature. Therefore, the cooling system works less to remove moisture.

40|$|Introduced in {{this article}} is a 1 : 15 brine model {{experiment}} rig with an actual large space building as the research object, which provides different concentration brine for a simulation of the stratified air conditioning in the steady-state flow field featured with columnar air supply in the bottom, heat source on the ground, the central <b>air</b> <b>return,</b> and <b>air</b> exhaust from roof in a large space. According to the similarity theory, it is concluded that the similarity criterion numbers applied here are Reynolds number (Re) and Archimedes number (Ar) for designation of experiment rig size, choosing device type, and confirming experiment condition. In the designation of key components of experiment rig, the application of automation control makes brine recovery and recycling in the process; designation of electrical control system makes a centralized control of experiment start–stop and the adjustment of the pipeline flow, realizing automation in the whole experiment process. Particle image velocimetry testing technology is used to get velocity vector field of <b>air</b> <b>return</b> mouth area in the model under various working conditions, and also proper orthogonal decomposition method is applied to analyze flow field structure of <b>air</b> <b>return</b> mouth area and reconstruct it. Consequently, we can get a kinetic energy ratio of <b>return</b> <b>air</b> entrainment of lower air-conditioning section and upper non-air-conditioning section in large space. Experiments show that under the conditions of same air supply, indoor environment temperature difference, and height and direction of <b>return</b> <b>air</b> inlet, fastening the speed of <b>return</b> <b>air</b> suction, the entrainment of flow field around it strengthens accordingly.

40|$|Cost {{reduction}} plays {{a significant}} role in the field of concentrated solar thermal energy. It is therefore essential to quantify all factors that influence the energy conversion efficiency. The <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio is a key factor for the overall efficiency of the open volumetric receiver. It is the fraction of the blown out air which is sucked in again through the solar receiver. To achieve a high receiver efficiency it is therefore important to increase the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. Many variables such as wind speed and direction, geometry of the receiver design and operational mode influence the air flow in front of the receiver. This in turn influences the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. It is therefore of vital importance to be able to measure the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio and furthermore visualize the air flow in front of the receiver. The <b>air</b> <b>return</b> value was prior to this work unknown on a large scale and under concentrated solar irradiation. The development of a measurement technique for the quantification of the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio with maximum accuracy is the main objective of this thesis. The second objective lies in the visualization of the <b>returned</b> <b>air.</b> This improves the understanding of the occurring flow phenomena which govern the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. The measurement methods were developed at a lab scale, tested under operating conditions and successfully demonstrated at the solar tower Jülich. In order to measure the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio, three variants of a novel circular tracer gas measurement technique have been developed. The tracer gas is injected either continuously or intermittently into the open air system. The tracer gas is diluted by the imperfect <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. The mole fraction of the injected noble gas helium is measured with a mass spectrometer within the air system, from which the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio is determined. A temporal resolution of 0. 5 s has been achieved. A maximal <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio of (68. 6 ± 0. 7) % with 95 % confidence interval has been measured during irradiation with concentrated sunlight at the solar tower power plant Jülich. This is higher than thepreviously assumed <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio of 60 %. This difference corresponds to a 4 − 5 % higher overall system efficiency. The <b>return</b> <b>air</b> in front of the receiver was visualized for the first time with the newly developed Induced Infrared Thermography. Hereby, carbon dioxide is added to the <b>return</b> <b>air.</b> This induces a larger amount of radiationbeing given off in the infrared region.

40|$|The {{supply air}} {{temperature}} set point for a singleduct constant air volume air handling unit (AHU) system is often reset based on either <b>return</b> <b>air</b> temperature or outside air temperature {{in order to reduce}} simultaneous cooling and heating energy consumption. Both reset strategies make engineering sense as long as the reset schedules are reasonable. Quite often the decision to use one over the other is made with the assumption that they will all achieve some sorts of energy savings. However, the impact of these two strategies on AHU energy consumption could be very different. A comparison of these two commonly used {{supply air temperature}} reset strategies for a single-duct constant air volume system is presented in this paper. It is shown that from either the building energy consumption or building comfort point of view, the reset strategy based on outside air temperature is inherently better than that based on <b>return</b> <b>air</b> temperature. Significant amount of heating energy savings can be achieved by switching from <b>return</b> <b>air</b> temperature based reset to outside air temperature based reset. The reset strategy can also benefit variable air volume (VAV) AHUs.

An experimental study was conducted to quantify the effect of several installation items on the high outdoor ambient temperature performance of air conditioners. These installation items were: improper amount of refrigerant charge, reduced evaporator airflow, and <b>return</b> <b>air</b> leakage from hot attic spaces. There were five sets of tests used for this research: two of them for the charging tests, two for the reduced evaporator airflow, and one for the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> leakage tests. For the charging tests, the indoor room conditions were 80 'F (27. 8 'C) dry-bulb and 50 % relative humidity. The outdoor conditions ranged from 95 'F (350 C) {{all the way up to}} 120 'F (48. 9 'C). Charge levels ranged from 30 % undercharged to 40 % overcharged for the short-tube orifice unit. For the thermal expansion valve (TXV) unit, charge levels ranged from- 36 % charging to + 27 % charging. Performance was quantified with the following variables: total capacity, energy efficiency ratio (EER), and power. The performance of the orifice unit was more sensitive to charge than it was for the TXV unit. For the TXV unit on the - 27 % to + 27 % charging range, the capacity and EER changed little with charge. A TXV unit and a short-tube orifice unit were also tested for reduced evaporator airflow. As evaporator airflow decreased, the capacity and EER both decreased as expected. However, the drop was not as significant as with the charging tests. For the extreme case of 50 % reduced evaporator airflow, neither unit's capacity or EER dropped more than 25 %. <b>Return</b> <b>air</b> leakage from hot attic spaces was simulated by assuming adiabatic mixing of the indoor air at normal conditions with the attic air at high temperatures. Effective capacity and EER both decreased with increased <b>return</b> <b>air</b> leakage. However, power consumption was relatively constant for all variables except outdoor temperature, which meant that for the same power consumption, the unit delivered much lower performance when there was <b>return</b> <b>air</b> leakage.
