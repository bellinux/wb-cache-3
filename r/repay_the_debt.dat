5|$|In 1990, the IRS seized most of Nelson's assets, {{claiming}} that he owed US$32,000,000. In addition to the unpaid taxes, Nelson's situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s. In 1978, after he fired Reshen, Nelson was introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. To <b>repay</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> Reshen had created with the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped. While the IRS disallowed his deductions for 1980, 1981 and 1982 (at a time that Nelson's income multiplied), due to penalties and interests, the debt increased {{by the end of}} the decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot of the}} novella {{describes}} the life journey of fourteen-year-old Eréndira, who is living with her grandmother when she accidentally sets fire to their home. The grandmother forces Eréndira to <b>repay</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> by becoming a prostitute as they travel the road as vagrants. Men line up to enjoy Eréndira's services. She eventually escapes {{with the assistance of}} her affectionate and somewhat gullible lover, Ulises, but only after he murders her grandmother. After the murder, Eréndira runs off into the night alone, leaving him in the tent with the dead body of her grandmother.|$|E
5|$|Gervase was royal {{justice in}} London in 1147, and {{continued}} to claim that title through the 1170s on his personal seal. He {{was one of the}} members of the royal administration under King Stephen of England. Gervase was also a merchant and financier. Around 1143 he loaned money to Stephen's wife Matilda of Boulogne, and received in pledge land at Gamlingay in Cambridgeshire. The queen was unable to <b>repay</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt,</b> and the lands pledged eventually became Gervase's. Gervase also loaned money to Hugh Tirel, son of Walter Tirel, in 1146 to enable Hugh to go on the Second Crusade. In return, Hugh pledged the manor of Langham in Essex to Gervase.|$|E

5|$|Bache {{had long}} {{cherished}} the wish of bringing Liszt to London, which Liszt had last visited in 1841 while still a touring virtuoso, and Liszt knew that whatever standing his music had {{in that city}} had {{in large part to}} do with Bache's efforts. At least in part to <b>repay</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> he felt he owed Bache, Liszt accepted Bache's invitation to attend celebrations in April 1886 to commemorate Liszt's 75th birthday. These celebrations included the foundation of a Liszt piano scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music, a performance of his oratorio The Legend of Saint Elizabeth led by Alexander Mackenzie in St. James's Hall, an audience with Queen Victoria and a public reception in Liszt's honour at the Grosvenor Gallery. Bache was involved in all four of these events, which were highly successful; by popular demand, Saint Elizabeth had to be repeated at the Crystal Palace.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the general}} public were unaware, {{chairman}} Peter Ridsdale had taken out large loans against the prospect of gate receipts from Champions League games. As Leeds had failed {{to qualify for the}} competition, there was simply not enough money coming in to <b>repay</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt.</b> The first indication that the club was in financial trouble was the sale of Rio Ferdinand to Manchester United for £30million, a world record for a defender. O'Leary and Ridsdale publicly fell out over the sale.|$|E
25|$|By 1964, the bullion {{value of}} the old silver pesos was worth almost twelve times their face value and were being hoarded by Filipinos rather than being {{surrendered}} to the government at face value. In desperation, then-President Diosdado Macapagal demonetized the old silver coins and floated the currency. The peso has been a floating currency ever since, {{which means that the}} currency is a physical representation of the domestic debt and whose value directly tied to people's perception of the stability of the current regime and its ability to <b>repay</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt.</b>|$|E

25|$|Reports of the club's {{precarious}} {{financial position}} continued to circulate, {{and in the}} January 2003 transfer window, more key players departed: Robbie Fowler, Olivier Dacourt, Lee Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate were sold to <b>repay</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt,</b> and to reduce an unsustainable wage bill. The sale of Woodgate particularly upset Venables, who had been promised by Ridsdale that the player would not be sold. Tensions mounted between the pair, eventually resulting in the sacking of Venables, who was replaced by Peter Reid. By now Leeds {{were in danger of}} relegation, but Reid saved Leeds from the drop with a 3–2 win away to Arsenal in the penultimate game of the season – a result which won the title for rivals Manchester United.|$|E
25|$|Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority. The Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority (TCTA) is a {{state-owned}} entity {{with the}} mission to finance and implement bulk raw water infrastructure.

As of 2012, TCTA has developed or is developing six other dam and bulk water supply projects throughout the country, including the Berg River Dam. TCTA sells bulk water to the government, represented by the Department of Water {{as the owner of}} the Water Boards that treat the water and sell it on to municipalities and mines.

25|$|Following the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, Sondhi's {{satellite}} and publishing businesses faced a meltdown.

The Manager Group's holding company alone had liabilities of THB 6 billion. Manager Media had Bt4.7 billion in debt. Sondhi was personally in debt for THB 1.5 billion. Sondhi ended up declaring himself bankrupt for three years. This meant that his THB 1.5 billion debt could be claimed from whatever was in his personal account for a span of three years, {{rather than having to}} <b>repay</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> over 15 or 20 years as earlier scheduled.|$|E

25|$|In early 1999 it was {{revealed}} that some six years earlier, AIB and Ansbacher Banks wrote off debts of almost IR£200,000 owed by FitzGerald following the collapse of the aircraft leasing company, Guinness Peat Aviation, in which he was a shareholder. Chairman of AIB at the time, Peter Sutherland, was also a former director of GPA and had served as Attorney General under FitzGerald, prior to FitzGerald appointing him as Ireland's member of the European Commission. The Moriarty Tribunal investigated this matter, and compared the treatment by AIB of FitzGerald with their treatment of Charles Haughey. They found no evidence of any wrongdoing, indeed the Tribunal heard evidence as to the considerable hardship that FitzGerald went to – to the extent of selling of his family home – to <b>repay</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> to the best of his ability.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though he}} used over sixty mules, he knew to the item what {{each of them}} carried, where they were being {{delivered}} to {{and what he had}} to charge. And although he ran mule trains for over half a century he never lost a pound of cargo, except in one instance when his secundo, upon smelling a two-pound package of Limburger Cheese, decided it was rotten and threw it away. Once aware of the error, Cataline made sure it was replaced and delivered. One of the best stories about him involves a loan that he had to make after a fatal disease had killed several of his mules. The bank manager questioned Cataline's collateral, wondering how many mules and horses he owned before consenting to lend him the money. When Cataline returned to the bank in the fall to <b>repay</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt,</b> he counted out the exact amount owing and paid it in full. The bank manager noted that Cataline had more money on his person and suggested that he deposit it in the bank. Cataline responded with a query as to how many horses and mules the bank owned, and upon learning it was none, decided to keep his money.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the criticisms {{levelled}} against the Hawke Government, it succeeded in enacting {{a wide range of}} social reforms during its time in office. Deflecting arguments that the Hawke Government had failed as a reform government, Neville Wran, John Dawkins, Bill Hayden and Paul Keating made a number of speeches throughout the 1980s arguing that the Hawke Government had been a recognisably reformist government, drawing attention to Hawke's achievements as Prime Minister during his first five years in office. As well as the reintroduction of Medibank, under the new name Medicare, these included the doubling of the number of childcare places, the introduction of occupational superannuation, a boost in school retention rates, a focus on young people's job skills, a doubling of subsidised homecare services, the elimination of poverty traps in the welfare system, a 50% increase in public housing funds, an increase in the real value of the old-age pension, {{the development of a new}} youth support program, the reintroduction of six-monthly indexation of single-person unemployment benefits, and significant improvements in social security provisions. As pointed out by John Dawkins, the proportion of total government outlays allocated to families, the sick, single parents, widows, the handicapped, and veterans was significantly higher under the Hawke Government than under the Whitlam Government. In 1989, the Hawke Labor Government gradually re-introducing fees for university study. It set up the Higher Education Contributions Scheme (HECS), which was first proposed by Professor Murray Wells and subsequently developed by economist and lecturer at the Australian National University, Bruce Chapman and championed by Education Minister John Dawkins (see Dawkins Revolution). Under the original HECS, a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students, and the Commonwealth paid the balance. A student could defer payment of this HECS amount (in which case it was called a HECS debt) and <b>repay</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> through the tax system, when the student's income exceeds a threshold level. As part of the reforms, Colleges of Advanced Education entered the University sector by various means. The HECS system was accepted by both federal political parties and has survived until today, though with a number of changes.|$|E
