5|$|After {{receiving}} a favourable omen {{during the night}} Pyrrhus renewed his assault. An effect of the shortage of warriors was that the Spartan women were active in providing the defenders with missiles and <b>refreshments</b> as well as taking away the wounded. In an attempt to nullify the Spartans' advantage, the Epiriotes tried to fill up with trench with debris and bodies but were prevented from doing so by the Sparta. Responding to this Spartan counter-attack, Pyrrhus personally led a charge against the Spartan lines and succeeded in entering the city, spreading panic amongst the defenders. However, at this point his horse threw him after it was wounded by a javelin in the belly. Pyrrhus' fall threw his companions {{into a state of}} dismay, permitting the Spartans to rally and they managed to slay many of the companions in a barrage of missiles. Despite this, Pyrrhus was taken safely back to his camp.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide <b>refreshments</b> to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E

40|$|The more {{number of}} foods which {{children}} who have food allergy cannot eat, the worse {{quality of life for}} them will be. Therefore, <b>refreshment</b> is important to avoid a lack of nutrition and support enjoyment for daily diet. This study shows recipes of <b>refreshment</b> (2 kinds of birthday cakes; A is easy to cook and B is difficult to cook, and 14 daily <b>refreshment)</b> which do not use eggs, flour and dairy products, and also shows a result of food preference survey against 20 women about birthday cakes and 30 women about daily <b>refreshment.</b> Comprehensive evaluation of A was over 3. 0 point in all 4 categories which included appearance, taste, smell and volume, but appearance and volume for B remained at 2. 9 ± 0. 8 point. About 14 daily <b>refreshment,</b> potato okonomiyaki and pumpkin pudding got good evaluation because all scores were over 3. 0 point. The cause of the stress for child parents who have food allergy is to consider the menus which remove the food for cause of allergy. Therefore, the <b>refreshment</b> ideas that are responded to food allergy help them to reduce the stress. After a change of <b>refreshment</b> based on this result, it is necessary to get evaluation from {{children who have}} food allergy and their mothers...|$|R

We also find that the fatigue can be prevented by driving the capacitor asymmetrically. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
5|$|Catherine's {{earliest}} {{building project}} was the château of Montceaux-en-Brie, near Paris, which Henry II gave her in 1556, {{three years before}} his death. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a pavilion at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played pall mall, an early form of croquet. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a grotto. He set it on a base {{made to look like}} natural rock, from which guests could watch the games while taking <b>refreshments.</b> The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived. The château ceased {{to be used as a}} royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the destructive tornadoes, Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour {{declared a state}} of emergency for 39counties. On April29, President Barack Obama signed a major disaster declaration for 29Mississippi counties in the wake of the Super Outbreak and another deadly outbreak on April15. This allowed residents and some local governments to sign up to receive federal funding to repair damage incurred from the storms. More than 60members of the Longino Baptist Church assisted residents of Neshoba County with debris removal and cleaning; also providing <b>refreshments.</b> The Salvation Army established a feeding center at the Coy Methodist Church. Disaster unemployment assistance was made available for people who lost their jobs due to storms and flooding, starting on May17.

5|$|In late August, Seacole was on {{the route}} to Cathcart's Hill for the final assault on Sevastopol on 7 September 1855. French troops led the storming, but the British were beaten back. By dawn on Sunday 9 September, the city was burning out of control, {{and it was clear}} that it had fallen: the Russians retreated to fortifications {{to the north of the}} harbour. Later in the day, Seacole {{fulfilled}} a bet, and became the first British woman to enter Sevastopol after it fell. Having obtained a pass, she toured the broken town, bearing <b>refreshments</b> and visiting the crowded hospital by the docks, containing thousands of dead and dying Russians. Her foreign appearance led to her being stopped by French looters, but she was rescued by a passing officer. She looted some items from the city, including a church bell, an altar candle, and a three-metre (10ft) long painting of the Madonna.|$|E
