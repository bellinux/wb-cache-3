5|$|Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio <b>Return</b> <b>Channel</b> (HEAC) adds a {{high-speed}} bidirectional data communication link (HEC) {{and the ability}} to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused Reserved pin (called HEAC+) and the Hot Plug Detect pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC transmission is required, a single mode signal using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair of lines, and ARC as a common mode component of the pair.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.4 was {{released}} on May 28, 2009, and the first HDMI 1.4 products were available {{in the second half}} of 2009. HDMI 1.4 added support for 4K×2K, i.e. 4096×2160 at 24Hz (which is a resolution used with digital theaters), 3840×2160 (Ultra HD) at 24Hz/25Hz/30Hz, and support for 1080p at 120Hz. It also added an HDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC) which allows for a 100Mbit/s Ethernet connection between the two HDMI connected devices so they can share an Internet connection, introduced an audio <b>return</b> <b>channel</b> (ARC), 3D Over HDMI, a new Micro HDMI Connector, an expanded set of color spaces with the addition of sYCC601, Adobe RGB and Adobe YCC601, and an Automotive Connection System. HDMI 1.4 defined several stereoscopic 3D formats including field alternative (interlaced), frame packing (a full resolution top-bottom format), line alternative full, side-by-side half, side-by-side full, 2D + depth, and 2D + depth + graphics + graphics depth (WOWvx). HDMI 1.4 requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24. High Speed HDMI cables as defined in HDMI 1.3 work with all HDMI 1.4 features except for the HDMI Ethernet Channel, which requires the new High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet defined in HDMI 1.4.|$|E
25|$|This {{procedure}} depends {{mainly on}} the receiver’s connectivity. It is possible to make a basic distinction between unidirectional networks, where the receiver can only receive information through the broadcast channel, and bidirectional networks, where {{there is also a}} <b>return</b> <b>channel</b> through which the receiver can communicate with the outside (typically an Internet access).|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of reverse logistics {{is evident in}} various industries. The benefits of reverse logistics and product recovery have also been highlighted in previous theoretical investigations. The motivations of its implementation are generally divided into legal, economic and socio-environmental factors. One of the crucial components of a reverse logistics system is product <b>return</b> <b>channels.</b> The success of other components especially the recovery operations depends {{on the performance of}} the <b>return</b> <b>channels.</b> Although numerous investigations on product <b>return</b> <b>channels</b> have been carried out, research on some critical aspects remains wanting. This study presents a review that highlights this deficiency; depicts latest research development on product <b>return</b> <b>channels,</b> relevant decisions making issues and direction for future research. The review emphasizes on the collection methods of drop-off, pick-up and mail return as the main return avenues that have largely been neglected in the previous research. At the end of the study, we propose a new closed-loop logistics network and future research propositions...|$|R

500|$|The Alternate Mode reconfigures {{the four}} SuperSpeed {{differential}} pairs present in USB-C {{to carry the}} three HDMI TMDS channels and the clock signal. The two Sideband Use pins (SBU1 and SBU2) are used to carry the HDMI Ethernet and Audio <b>Return</b> <b>Channel</b> and the Hot Plug Detect functionality (HEAC+/Utility pin and HEAC−/HPD pin). As {{there are not enough}} reconfigurable pins remaining in USB-C to accommodate the DDC clock (SCL), DDC data (SDA), and CEC – these three signals are bridged between the HDMI source and sink via the USB Power Delivery 2.0 (USB-PD) protocol, and are carried over the USB-C Configuration Channel (CC) wire. This is possible because the cable is [...] electronically marked (i.e., it contains a USB-PD node) that serves to tunnel the DDC and CEC from the source over the Configuration Channel to the node in the cable, these USB-PD messages are received and relayed to the HDMI sink as regenerated DDC (SCL and SDA signals), or CEC signals.|$|E
500|$|For digital audio, if an HDMI device has audio, it is {{required}} to implement the baseline format: stereo (uncompressed) PCM. Other formats are optional, with HDMI allowing up to 8 channels of uncompressed audio at sample sizes of 16-bit, 20-bit and 24-bit, with sample rates of 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, 176.4kHz and 192kHz. HDMI also carries any IEC 61937-compliant compressed audio stream, such as Dolby Digital and DTS, and up to 8 channels of one-bit DSD audio (used on Super Audio CDs) at rates up to four times that of Super Audio CD. With version 1.3, HDMI allows lossless compressed audio streams Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. [...] As with the YCbCr video, audio capability is optional. Audio <b>return</b> <b>channel</b> (ARC) is a feature introduced in the HDMI 1.4 standard. [...] "Return" [...] refers to the case where the audio comes from the TV and can be sent [...] "upstream" [...] to the AV receiver using the HDMI cable connected to the AV receiver.

2500|$|In Ireland DTT {{has been}} {{somewhat}} problematic. Responsibility for DTT, based on plans of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, was divided between two government Departments with differing views on its running. This delayed the project, took away its momentum and the economic situation deteriorated so that the opportunity to launch in good conditions was lost. When legislation finally arrived after two years to enable DTT to proceed, a private sector model was envisaged similar to the UK. A company trading as [...] "It's TV" [...] was the sole applicant for a digital terrestrial television license under {{the provisions of the}} Irish Broadcasting Act 2001.

However legislative delays and economic changes made it financially difficult for RTÉ to get a good price for the network stake. [...] "It's TV" [...] plans raise the necessary funding failed {{due to the lack of}} approval for Internet aspect and infeasible Internet access model. Other DTT deployments in operation around that time also went bust, most particularly in the UK, Spain and Portugal. [...] "It's TV" [...] failed to get its license conditions varied or to get a time extension for securing funding. Its license was either never awarded (as they could not demonstrate a viable business plan & funding) or was eventually withdrawn for non-performance.|$|E
