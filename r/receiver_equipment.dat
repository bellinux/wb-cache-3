5|$|The {{telescope}} was constructed {{so that the}} bowl could be completely inverted. Originally, {{it was intended to}} use a movable tower {{at the base of the}} telescope to change the receivers at the focus. However, the movable tower was never built, due jointly to funding constraints and the fact that much of the <b>receiver</b> <b>equipment</b> was placed at the base of the telescope rather than at the focus. Instead, receivers were mounted on 50-foot (15-m) long steel tubes, which were then inserted by a winch into the top of the aerial tower while the bowl was inverted. The cables from the receivers then ran down the inside of this tube, which could then be connected when the {{telescope was}} pointed at the zenith. Associated <b>receiver</b> <b>equipment</b> could then be placed either in the small, swinging laboratory directly underneath the surface; in rooms at the tops of the two towers; at the base girders, or in the control building.|$|E
25|$|Its {{business}} model {{is to provide}} pay-for-service radio, analogous to the {{business model}} for premium cable television. Music channels are presented without advertising, while its talk channels, such as Howard Stern's Howard 100 and Howard 101 & Jim Norton & Sam Roberts Faction talk 103, carry commercials. Because all channels are free from FCC content regulation, songs are played unedited for language; talk programs may also feature explicit content if they wish. Subscriptions are prepaid and {{range in price from}} US$14.99 monthly (US$9.99 for each additional receiver) to US$699.99 for lifetime (of the <b>receiver</b> <b>equipment)</b> There is a US$15 activation fee for every radio activated.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} quantum {{key distribution}} implementations in which the receiver’s apparatus is fixed and {{does not depend on}} a choice of basis at each qubit transmission. We show that, although theoretical {{quantum key distribution}} (QKD) is proven secure, such implementations are totally insecure against a strong eavesdropper that has a one-time (single) access to the <b>receiver’s</b> <b>equipment.</b> The attack we present here, the “fixed-apparatus attack ” causes a potential risk to the usefulness of several recent QKD implementations...|$|R
2500|$|Voltage {{standing}} wave ratio (VSWR) measurements may be taken {{to ensure that a}} waveguide is contiguous and has no leaks or sharp bends. If such bends or holes in the waveguide surface are present, this may diminish the performance of both transmitter and <b>receiver</b> <b>equipment</b> connected at either end. Poor transmission through the waveguide may also occur as a result of moisture build up which corrodes and degrades conductivity of the inner surfaces, which is crucial for low loss propagation. For this reason, waveguides are nominally fitted with microwave windows at the outer end that will not interfere with propagation but keep the elements out. Moisture can also cause fungus build up or arcing in high power systems such as radio or radar transmitters. Moisture in waveguides can typically be prevented with silica gel, a desiccant, or slight pressurization of the waveguide cavities with dry nitrogen or argon. Desiccant silica gel canisters may be attached with screw-on nibs and higher power systems will have pressurized tanks for maintaining pressure including leakage monitors. Arcing may also occur if there is a hole, tear or bump in the conducting walls, if transmitting at high power (usually 200 watts or more). Waveguide plumbing [...] is crucial for proper waveguide performance. Voltage {{standing wave}}s occur when impedance mismatches in the waveguide cause energy to reflect back in the opposite direction of propagation. In addition to limiting the effective transfer of energy, these reflections can cause higher voltages in the waveguide and damage equipment.|$|E
