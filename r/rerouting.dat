5|$|A bypass of Zeeland {{opened in}} 1958, <b>rerouting</b> M-21 around the town. The I-196 freeway opened through Grand Rapids in 1964, and M-21 was routed along the freeway between Chicago Drive in Grandville and downtown, using I-96 to {{complete}} the connection to its previous routing on Fulton Street.|$|E
5|$|A <b>rerouting</b> in late 1971 {{moved the}} US45 {{designation}} along M-26 between Rockland and Greenland. From Greenland, US45 followed Ontonagon–Greenland Road to Ontonagon. In late 1973, MDOT reversed the rerouting—US45 was {{restored to its}} previous routing on Rockland Road between Rockland and Ontonagon and M-26 was re-extended south from Greenland to Rockland; M-38 was extended west along Ontonagon–Greenland Road.|$|E
5|$|Abusing his wife's {{power as}} mayor, Peter begins by <b>rerouting</b> the city's electricity, causing rolling blackouts. When Brian {{questions}} Peter's actions, Peter reveals that he's {{been using the}} power to reanimate actor Jim Varney's corpse (he'd actually wanted to bring back actor and Saturday Night Live alumnus John Belushi).|$|E
50|$|US 6 was <b>rerouted</b> between Illinois {{state line}} and US 41 (Calumet Avenue), routed {{concurrent}} with US 41 and the Tri-state Highway, this <b>reroute</b> happened between 1953 and 1953. The highway was <b>rerouted</b> {{to the modern}} route through Kendallville in October 1959. US 6 and US 41 was <b>rerouted</b> on to Indianapolis Avenue between 1963 and 1964. A <b>reroute</b> of US 6 to its modern route in Lake County, concurrent with SR 51 and the Borman Expressway, occurred in either 1966 or 1967. US 6 was <b>rerouted</b> around Bremen, on a new roadway, between 1980 and 1981. The old route of US 6 through Bremen became SR 106.|$|R
50|$|Beginning on April 8, 1960, {{daytime service}} was <b>rerouted</b> from Dyre Avenue to 241st Street, and service in Brooklyn was <b>rerouted</b> from New Lots Avenue to Flatbush Avenue. At the same time, late night service was <b>rerouted</b> from Flatbush Avenue to New Lots Avenue.|$|R
5000|$|In 1962, NC 18 was <b>rerouted</b> in {{downtown}} North Wilkesboro, from B Street to a split with northbound along 10th Street and southbound along D Street and Forester Avenue. [...] In 1966, NC 18 was <b>rerouted</b> {{in downtown}} Shelby, from South Washington and East Graham Streets to South Lafayette Street.

5|$|Early roads {{existed in}} the place of FM 1528 by 1936, and a short section of highway between SH 27 (now SH 24) and Klondike was {{designated}} as Loop 39 in 1939, and FM 1528 was designated in 1949. The route of the highway has been altered since its designation, including <b>rerouting</b> due to the construction of Cooper Lake.|$|E
5|$|Highway89 {{was created}} {{out of a}} highway <b>rerouting</b> in the late 1930s. Originally, it formed the routing of Highway9, which until then turned north at Orangeville, {{travelling}} concurrently with Highway10, then turning east to Cookstown. On February10, 1937, Highway9 was rerouted along its present course east of Orangeville.|$|E
5|$|M-95 was {{previously}} designated as M-45. The number was switched when US45 was designated in Michigan. The trunkline incorporates {{a portion of}} the former M-12 which became US2. A section of the highway near Republic was turned over to Marquette County during a <b>rerouting</b> of the highway in the 1940s, becoming County Road 601.|$|E
50|$|In 1960 or 1961, SC 49 was <b>rerouted</b> from Lockhart to Mount Tabor. At {{an unknown}} date, SC 49 was <b>rerouted</b> north around {{downtown}} Union.|$|R
5|$|The E and J trains were <b>rerouted</b> to Jamaica Center. Buses {{were also}} <b>rerouted</b> from the 169th Street station {{to the new}} Jamaica Center station to serve the <b>rerouted</b> subway services. A new skip-stop service, called the Z train, was {{implemented}} along the J route, similar to skip-stop service along the route prior to 1976.|$|R
40|$|The Optimized Route Capability (ORC) concept {{proposed}} by the FAA facilitates traffic managers to identify and resolve arrival flight delays caused by bottlenecks formed at arrival meter fixes when there exists imbalance between arrival fixes and runways. ORC makes use of the prediction capability of existing automation tools, monitors the traffic delays based on these predictions, and searches the best <b>reroutes</b> upstream of the meter fixes based on the predictions and estimated arrival schedules when delays are over a predefined threshold. Initial implementation and evaluation of the ORC concept considered only <b>reroutes</b> {{available at the time}} arrival congestion was first predicted. This work extends previous work by introducing an additional dimension in <b>reroute</b> options such that ORC can find the best time to <b>reroute</b> and overcome the 'firstcome- first-reroute' phenomenon. To deal with the enlarged <b>reroute</b> solution space, a genetic algorithm was developed to solve this problem. Experiments were conducted using the same traffic scenario used in previous work, when an arrival rush was created for one of the four arrival meter fixes at George Bush Intercontinental Houston Airport. Results showed the new approach further improved delay savings. The suggested route changes from the new approach were on average 30 minutes later than those using other approaches, and fewer numbers of <b>reroutes</b> were required. Fewer numbers of <b>reroutes</b> reduce operational complexity and later <b>reroutes</b> help decision makers deal with uncertain situations...|$|R
5|$|The A82 {{originally}} {{ended on}} the A9 {{to the west}} of the Ness Bridge near Inverness city centre. The current diversion over the Friars Bridge towards the modern A9 opened in 1986, in co-ordination with the redevelopment and extension of Inverness docks in the early 1980s and the <b>rerouting</b> of the A9 onto the Kessock Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The East Topeka {{interchange}} {{was completely}} rebuilt {{in the late}} 1990s, with a goal of <b>rerouting</b> I-70 and improving access to the turnpike. The design was completed in 1997, and the project was finished in 2001 {{at a cost of}} $98.6 million in 1999 dollars.|$|E
5|$|US-62 was realigned for a {{third time}} on September 4, 1961. This routing was only meant to be temporary, {{following}} Agnew, Exchange, and Reno Avenues to downtown. This change was followed up by the September 4, 1963 <b>rerouting,</b> which put US-62 onto its present-day routing (though I-240 did not exist yet, and I-44 still ended at I-35).|$|E
500|$|Much of I-29 {{was built}} next to {{existing}} highways, most notably US75. [...] When {{the section of}} I-29 opened between Council Bluffs and Missouri Valley, US75 was <b>rerouted</b> onto I-29. [...] When construction connecting the Sioux City and Council Bluffs segments was completed, US75 was again <b>rerouted</b> onto I-29. [...] In the mid-1980s, US75, from Council Bluffs to Sioux City, was completely <b>rerouted</b> out of Iowa, instead extending up the former US73 corridor in Nebraska.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, I-85 was <b>rerouted</b> around Greensboro; and it {{split with}} I-40 8 mi {{east of the}} {{original}} departure point. I-40 ran with I-85 along the bypass to the southern/western end and I-40 continued on a new freeway alignment at exit 121 until September 2008, when it was <b>rerouted</b> back to its old alignment through the city. Despite its <b>reroute</b> around Greensboro, the overall length for I-85 in North Carolina remains the same as before.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, US 74 was <b>rerouted</b> onto I-40 for 1.58 mi, in Asheville, {{and then}} onto I-26, from Asheville to Columbus. East of Columbus, it {{traverses}} along new freeway to Forest City, where it meets back with its old alignment. The former routing between Asheville and Forest City becomes US 74A. [...] In 1996, US 74 was <b>rerouted</b> through Wilmington. [...] In late 1997, US 74 was <b>rerouted</b> onto I-40, between Clyde and Asheville.|$|R
5|$|A {{road from}} the town of Potrero to Tecate existed by 1917. The Tecate border {{crossing}} originally opened in 1932. In 1938, the San Diego County board of supervisors proposed moving <b>rerouting</b> the road to be shorter and on more level ground, although there was opposition from local residents and businesses who favored the old road. However, the route of the road to Tecate has remained the same since then.|$|E
5|$|Caltrans {{has plans}} to add a ramp from {{southbound}} SR125 to SR94 to improve the interchange; {{it is in the}} environmental planning stages, and is estimated to cost $71million. Also in the planning stages are high-occupancy toll lanes between the I-5 and I-805 interchanges, and <b>rerouting</b> part of SR94 east of the junction with Jamacha Boulevard while improving some interchanges.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, a <b>rerouting</b> of US16 {{eliminated}} M-126 between Nunica and Muskegon; {{the previous}} routing of US16 between Nunica and Ferrysburg was redesignated M-104 at this time. This highway designation was truncated on November 25, 1961, after the I-96/US16 freeway opened, and {{the section of}} M-104 between the freeway and the old US16 routing was transferred to local control. Another short segment of the highway was bypassed when a new bridge was built between Spring Lake and Ferrysburg in 1965.|$|E
50|$|In or by 1947, NC 49 was <b>rerouted</b> in Richfield, {{removing}} a concurrency with US 52. And in Asheboro, NC 49 was <b>rerouted</b> onto US 64 to Ramseur, then northeast to Liberty; its old alignment becoming NC 49A.|$|R

The dynamic constraint avoidance route system includes a graphical user interface that allows users to visualize, evaluate, modify if necessary, and implement proposed <b>reroutes...</b>|$|R
5|$|In April 1958, the MSHD {{wanted to}} provide a single number for a more direct routing of a Detroit–Chicago freeway; the state {{proposed}} <b>rerouting</b> I-94 to replace I-92 in the state, but retained the I-77 designation. On June 27, 1958, AASHO adopted their original numbering plan for Michigan, minus the state's proposed changes. Around the same time, a section of M-146 near Port Huron was converted into an approach freeway for the Blue Water Bridge.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 1986, the Oklahoma State Transportation Commission (which had {{replaced}} the Highway Commission) approved <b>rerouting</b> US-60/SH-11 {{on the east side}} of Pawhuska. While the two highways still passed through Pawhuska from west to east, after turning north, the new route bypassed much of the city. The application for this alteration was submitted to AASHTO on September 22, received the same day, and approved on November 8.|$|E
5|$|Ptolemy II Philadelphus, {{emperor of}} Ptolemaic Egypt, may have forged an {{alliance}} with the Lihyanites {{in order to secure}} the incense route at Dedan, thereby <b>rerouting</b> the incense trade from Dedan to the coast along the Red Sea to Egypt. I. E. S. Edwards connects the Syro-Ephraimite War to the desire of the Israelites and the Aramaeans to control the northern end of the Incense route, which ran up from Southern Arabia and could be tapped by commanding Transjordan.|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, {{because the}} Q65 is {{frequently}} detoured to avoid blocked {{traffic on the}} narrow 14th Road, the Q65 will be <b>rerouted</b> to run via 14th Avenue in College Point. Six bus stops will be <b>rerouted</b> to 14th Avenue, being replaced by three stops.|$|R
50|$|It is {{expected}} that SR 293 will either be decommissioned south of SR 61/SR 113 in Cartersville, or <b>rerouted</b> east on the current SR 113 (Main Street), traveling to I-75 {{in place of the}} current SR 113, which will be <b>rerouted</b> to the south.|$|R
2500|$|Between July 1, 1928 and January 1, 1929, {{the southernmost}} portion of SH-36 was <b>rerouted.</b> The segment of highway between Grandfield and the Red River bridge {{south of town}} {{was removed from the}} state highway system; instead, SH-36 was <b>rerouted</b> to the east, serving Devol and ending at US-70 west of Randlett, where US-70 turned south to cross the river north of Burkburnett, Texas. Between August 1933 and February 1934, US-70 was <b>rerouted</b> to follow a more direct path between Randlett and the Texas line. A north–south segment of the old highway was {{assigned}} to SH-36—the southernmost [...] of the present-day highway. On March 3, 1945, US-70 was <b>rerouted</b> to cross into Texas south of Davidson instead, forming the concurrency with SH-36 east of Grandfield.|$|R
5|$|The MSHD {{completed}} a major <b>rerouting</b> of M-66 around 1944–45. The M-14 designation {{of the time}} was decommissioned and replaced with M-66. Starting at Six Lakes, M-66 turned west along M-46 instead of east and then turned south through Stanton and Ionia ending north of Battle Creek. The highway between Lowell and Lakeview was redesignated as M-91. A minor realignment in late 1950 removed two 90° curves near the Osceola–Missaukee county line {{and replaced them with}} a pair of sweeping curves.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} growth of long-distance railway traffic {{led to a}} major expansion along the station's west side starting in 1887. The work involved <b>rerouting</b> Cardington Street over a burial ground; to avoid public outcry, the graves were re-interred at St Pancras Cemetery. Two extra platforms (Nos.4–5) opened in 1891, and four further departure platforms (now Nos.12–15) opened on 1 July 1892, bringing the total to fifteen, along with a separate booking office on Drummond Street.|$|E
5|$|When {{the rest}} of the state highway system was first designated, by July 1, 1919, the first state highway in the area of today's M-134 was a section of M-12. That highway segment was used for US2 in 1926. A <b>rerouting</b> of US2 was {{completed}} in 1933 between Rogers Park and Sault Ste. Marie. The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to Cedarville and north to Sault Ste. Marie. The former routing was given the M-121 designation, and later M-4.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, SC 5 was <b>rerouted</b> on bypass {{northwest}} around York, its old alignment {{through downtown}} becoming SC 5 Business. Around 2006-2009, SC 5 <b>rerouted</b> {{to its current}} northern terminus with I-85/SC 198, in Blacksburg; its old alignment was downgraded to secondary roads. In 2013, SC 5 was <b>rerouted</b> southwest around Rock Hill, along Albright Road and Heckle Boulevard; its old alignment downgraded to city roads with only its northern section of Main Street, between Cherry Road and Heckle Boulevard, converting into a connector.|$|R
