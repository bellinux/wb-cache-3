40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{voluntary}} {{control of}} micturition {{is believed to}} be integrated by complex interactions among the brainstem, subcortical areas and cortical areas. Several brain imaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET) have demonstrated that frontal brain areas, the limbic system, the pons and the premotor cortical areas were involved. However, the cortical and subcortical brain areas have not yet been precisely identified and their exact function is not yet completely understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare brain activity during passive filling and emptying of the bladder. A cathetherism of the bladder was performed in seven healthy subjects (one man and six right-handed women). During scanning, the bladder was alternatively filled and emptied at a constant rate with bladder <b>rincing</b> solution. RESULTS: Comparison between passive filling of the bladder and emptying of the bladder showed an increased brain activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus, cerebellum, symmetrically in the operculum and mesial frontal. Subcortical areas were not evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that several cortical brain areas are involved in the regulation of micturition...|$|E

2500|$|Oireachtas <b>Rince</b> na Cruinne (English: The Irish Dancing World Championships; often {{simply the}} Worlds) is an annual Irish stepdance {{competition}} run by An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha (the Irish Dancing Commission). The first Oireachtas <b>Rince</b> na Cruinne was run in 1970, and {{the event is}} now one of six oireachtais under different organisations to be called the World Championships. Of these, Oireachtas <b>Rince</b> na Cruinne, sometimes called the [...] "Olympics of Irish dance", is the largest, attracting some 5,000 competitors and 25,000 spectators each year from over 30 countries. The Worlds traditionally run across Holy Week, and since the early 21st century have run in different cities each year both within and outside Ireland. The Worlds include competitions for solo stepdance, organised by gender and age; and for certain traditional and original ceili dances, also divided by age group and team gender composition.|$|R

In some regions of the United States, pre-qualification for qualifiers in required. For each section at both primary and secondary qualifiers (according to the age groups of Oireachtas <b>Rince</b> na Cruinne) the top 5 placed dancers qualify, {{as well as an}} additional dancer for every 10 participants in the section. Generally speaking, all dancers must compete and qualify at their primary qualifier; however, dancers who fail to do so may qualify at their secondary qualifier or may be eligible for automatic qualification if they placed in a medal winning position at the previous Oireachtas <b>Rince</b> na Cruinne. Dancers who do not participate in their primary qualifier may not qualify secondarily or automatically unless they submit a valid reason, such as a medical condition, to An Coimisiún.|$|R

5000|$|The rinkafadda (<b>rince</b> fada or rinnce fada, [...] "long dance"), {{also called}} simply the rinka, {{is a country}} or field dance {{that goes back to}} sixteenth-century Ireland. During this period, {{visitors}} to Ireland described the dance consisting of a row of men facing a row of women. Beginning {{at one end of the}} line, the couples start dancing one by one until all have joined in, dancing starting at one end, and going to the other and then back again. Noted for its social inclusiveness and its appropriateness to events of public rejoicing, accounts described how all social classes took part in the <b>rince</b> fada together.|$|R

The [...] "set" [...] of the name refers to a particular tune, rather than to any specified choreography. The set dance at Oireachtas <b>Rince</b> na Cruinne is performed in a contrasting time to the first round– that is, if the dancer performed a hornpipe ( [...] time) in the first round, they must perform a jig ( [...] time) in the set dance round, and vice versa.
