Most studies to date have examined parent–offspring recognition only in species that provide offspring with direct parental care, however, there are several advantages to parent–offspring recognition even in the absence of direct parental care. In this study we investigated <b>reciprocal</b> mother–offspring <b>recognition</b> in the Australian scincid lizard Eulamprus heatwolei, a species that does not show direct parental care. We examined whether neonates could discriminate between their mothers and unrelated females, and whether females could discriminate between their offspring and unrelated neonates, via chemical cues, using retreat site selection experiments. We conducted trials when neonates were 1 and 4 weeks old to investigate whether responses are maintained as neonates age. We found that both neonates and mothers could discriminate between related and unrelated individuals when neonates were 1 week old. Mothers were more likely to take refuge under tiles treated with the odours of their own offspring, while neonates spent less time in areas treated with the odours of unrelated females. At 4 weeks of age, mothers no longer exhibited discriminatory behaviour between their offspring and unrelated neonates, while neonates were more likely to associate with the odour of any female over the odourless control. We hypothesize that <b>reciprocal</b> mother–offspring <b>recognition</b> in E. heatwolei reduces interference competition between mothers and their offspring and also may be important in habitat selection and territory establishment. © 2009 Ecological Society of Australi...|$|R

40|$|The study {{seeks to}} {{determine}} the motivational factors that influence knowledge sharing, identify the obstacles to knowledge sharing, determine the nature of relationship between structural capital and human capital, and ascertain the extent of sharing knowledge in public sector organizations. The study was carried out primarily through the survey method and interview of employees in three public sector organizations in Nigeria. Secondary data were obtained through books, journals, and internet.

Knowledge sharing as a concept is essential and provides several business opportunities. It is necessary for creating a new knowledge in order to achieve competitive advantage.

Multiculturalism overlaps with the democratic definition of <b>reciprocal</b> rules of <b>recognition</b> between distinct identities and cultures. Our hypothesis is that the process of political construction of alternatives is particularly evident in Latin America movements and recent political experiences. These new political practices are analyzed against the theoretical background of Sousa Santos’ approach, therefore not only as practical antagonist experiences, but as emancipation methods which, as they have not been foreseen by the great theoretical tradition of the Eurocentric left, may actually contradict it and put it into a theoretical as well as political crisis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Roseolovirus genus of the Betaherpesvirinae {{consists}} of the very closely related viruses, human herpesvirus 6 variants A and B (HHV- 6 A and HHV- 6 B) plus the somewhat more distantly related human herpesvirus 7 (HHV- 7). The roseoloviruses each encode a homolog of the alphaherpesvirus origin binding protein (OBP) which is required for lytic DNA replication. In contrast, members of the other betaherpesvirus genera, the cytomegaloviruses, initiate DNA replication by a different mechanism. To better understand the basis of roseolovirus OBP sequence specificity, we investigated their ability to recognize each other's binding sites. HHV- 6 A OBP (OBPH 6 A) and HHV- 6 B OBP (OBPH 6 B) each bind to both of the HHV- 7 OBP sites (OBP- 1 and OBP- 2) with similar strengths, which are also similar to their nearly equivalent interactions with their own sites. In contrast, HHV- 7 OBP (OBPH 7) had a gradient of binding preferences: HHV- 7 OBP- 2 > HHV- 6 OBP- 2 > HHV- 7 OBP- 1 > HHV- 6 OBP- 1. Thus, the roseolovirus OBPs are not equally <b>reciprocal</b> in their <b>recognition</b> of each other's OBP sites, suggesting that the sequence requirements for the interaction of OBPH 7 at the OBP sites in its cognate oriLyt {{differ from those of}} OBPH 6 A and OBPH 6 B...|$|R

This research informs the development of a relational framework based on stakeholder perspectives. It is grounded in an action research project with practitioners, and draws on a previous literature review, to present the underpinning elements of quality relationships as statements, organised under the headings of integrity, respect, fairness, compassion and trust. Using Q methodology, 27 participants, comprising a range of stakeholders (staff, residents, family and service providers), rank-ordered 48 statements based on perceptions of the importance of differing aspects of relationships. By-person factor analysis was used to create five factors or viewpoints by comparing and contrasting using the composite rankings alongside interview data collected for each participant. The first view ‘Altogether now’ prioritises compassionate engagement. Secondly, ‘Respect is a two way street’ emphasises the need for <b>reciprocal</b> respect and <b>recognition</b> of history. The factor labelled ‘Free spirits’ posits the dominant view of freedom. The fourth view ‘Families… strengths and challenges’ focusses on the necessary and complex involvement of families and finally, ‘Helping hands’ emphasises the role of relationships in increasing previously low expectations of social integration for previously isolated residents. The different views that exist on the composition of quality relationships can be used to help extra-care communities to understand and utilise relationships as a powerful and effective resource...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} is {{a critical}} analysis of, and engagement with agricultural and food based geographical indications, the politics of development and international relations, and the prospects of forming reformist linkages between geographical indications and development in Jamaica and the Caribbeans intellectual property landscape. A net importer of intellectual property, Jamaica has yet to fully claim intellectual property as its own. The dissertation proposes that geographical indication schemes should be envisaged, and practically function as part of Jamaicas development policy. This approach calls for a reformist approach to intellectual property in Jamaica, which includes {{an awareness of the}} pitfalls of being a repository base for the hegemons intellectual property ideals. I approach development and intellectual property rights in the Third World as two terms that are often incongruent with each other, absent a participatory and strategic approach to sustaining viable linkages between the two concepts. A counter-hegemonic intellectual property strategy for Jamaica and the Caribbean focuses on domestic and regional coalition building between key stakeholders, a path that is not without its challenges. Blue Mountain coffee is used to illustrate and conceptualize a notion of intellectual property working from a Third World people based perspective: for the benefit of those who are often forgotten in Blue Mountain coffees value chain. I critically address domestic and international challenges that are likely to affect the positioning of geographical indications as an intellectual property asset of development in Jamaica. From the analyses, the most significant international issues relate to <b>reciprocal</b> rights <b>recognition</b> for geographical indications and product pricing, a factor that is dependent on consumer demand. Power and politics in the international relations of geographical indications impact its ability to be a counter-hegemonic force in Jamaicas intellectual property futures. The role of Jamaicas political culture in facilitating developmental changes through geographical indications is also crucial {{to the success of the}} initiative. International jurisdictional differences over the precise scope of protection accorded to geographical indications are a significant obstacle to the advancement of rights domestically. The dissertation theoretically and practically tackles these issues, and suggest policy recommendations to overcome identified challenges...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{compares the}} {{identity}} politics of Frantz Fanon and ‘Periyar’ EV Ramasamy. After framing an interpretative paradigm {{through which the}} core ideas of Fanon could be deciphered, an interpretation of Fanon as a rigorous critic of identity politics is arrived at. Exploring Fanon’s strained relation with the particularist Black identity politics of Negritude and his own imperative for the need to transcend from particularist identity politics to a genuine, universal humanism, I seek to prove that while Fanon rejected the false universalism of European humanism, he did not support rigidly identitarian movements either. Fanon’s universalism {{was based on a}} <b>reciprocal</b> and respectful <b>recognition</b> between cultures and peoples, working towards a universal humanism. After a brief introduction to the socio-historical context of Ramasamy’s politics, I then use this Fanonist lens to critique the anti-caste political discourse of Ramasamy, especially how he articulated his concerns towards the Brahmin Other and the non-Brahmin Self, and his approach towards the untouchable Dalit castes. I argue that his fixation with the Brahmin identity as the ultimate Other responsible for the inferiorization of the non-Brahmin castes, and his consideration of this identity as immutable and irredeemable, made a lasting universality impossible. Yet, Ramasamy’s penetrating insights on the myriad ways in which native culture in the colony oppresses minorities and marginalized groups challenges Fanon’s beliefs in the redemptive power of Third World anti-colonial universality. In the conclusion, based on the dialogue between Ramasamy and Fanon, I explore the limits of particularism and the needs of universalism, making a case for a constitutive, but conditional, pluralism...|$|R
40|$|Today {{people use}} a variety of social and gameful (mobile) {{applications}} in order to motivate themselves and others to maintain difficult habits such as exercise, sustainable consumption and healthy eating. However, we have yet lacked understanding of how social influence affects willingness to maintain these difficult habits with the help of gamification services. In order to investigate this phenomenon, this study measures how social influence predicts attitudes, use and further exercise in the context of gamification exercise in relation to generational differences. The specific objective of this research was; how do generational differences moderate the relationship between attitude and intention to continue to use gamification. The research model draws from the theory of planned behaviour and is extended with <b>recognition</b> and perceived <b>reciprocal</b> benefits. Both are hypothesised to be relevant social factors that predict attitudes and user behaviour in gamification services. The social factors used in this study can be categorised as follows: Attitude, Continued Use, Continued Exercise, <b>Reciprocal</b> Benefits, <b>Recognition,</b> Subjective Norms, and Word-of-Mouth intentions. Generational difference is used to incorporate the demographic effect. For this study four generations were defined: (1) Veterans; (2) Baby Boomers; (3) Generation Xers; and (4) Nexters. The data was gathered via a questionnaire filled in by users of a running app (an app that tracks running that people do for fitness), a mobile service that gamifies running. Each variable included four items except for Continued Exercise, which included three items, and were measured with 7 -point Likert scales. The findings of this thesis do not support all of the hypothesized relationships proposed in the theoretical model. Specifically, the results revealed that subjective norms {{have a significant effect on}} recognition, and recognition also has a significant effect on reciprocal benefits. The final relationship that shows a significant effect is that users who continued to use the app continued to exercise. The other relationships hypothesized in this study appear to have no significant effect. After analysing the results, it seems there is no moderation effect of generational differences on the relationship between a user’s attitude and continued use of gamification. The relationship between the elements could be described as more of a ‘dissatisfiers’ type because only the method of linear regression is used. Based on the outcome of this research, there is no need to reorganize the practical approach. In-depth research on the relationship between ATT and CU is recommended by the researchers because it is too early to claim that ATT has no role in predicting CU intentions. It begs for further theoretical and empirical investigations. As Liao et al. (2006) states, CU will increase job performance and organizational rewards. It would be interesting to investigate the through motivator for CU. This would contribute by interpreting this research mode and by creating a stepping stone for further research and alternative models. There is no need to focus on a specific generation (e. g., generational differences), because the outcome seems to show there is no direct relationship between generational differences and the need to continue using a running app.. Furthermore, it is wise to develop a community around a gamification service so that users can receive feedback on their exercise results. This creates the possibility of influencing the subjective norms of the users. Also the sample method (i. e., convenience sampling) has limitations because there is no sound basis for estimating statistical confidence intervals around the sample statistics of interest (Green, 1988). In further research it would be interesting to see on what gameful aspects a run app have the best social influence on user’s attitudes...|$|R
