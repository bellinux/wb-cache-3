50|$|Without relay valves, {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to travel from the brake pedal valve {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear service brakes concurrently with the front service brakes, resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> is installed near the rear service brake chambers. In tractors as well as straight-trucks, a remote air-supply is provided in the form of a large diameter pipe connected between the primary reservoir and the <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> for remote service brake application.|$|E
50|$|With {{a service}} brake <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear service brake chambers, and quickly applies the rear service brakes. The pressure delivered to the service brake chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the <b>relay</b> <b>valve.</b> When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear service brake chambers.|$|E
50|$|In a truck’s {{air brake}} system, <b>relay</b> <b>valves</b> get a signal when a driver presses the treadle, which then opens the valve and allows air {{to enter the}} brake chamber via air inlet. The {{diaphragm}} gets pushed, then the rod, then the slack adjuster which twists to turn the brake camshaft. Next, it moves the disc, wedge or s-cam, which pushes the brake shoes and lining, creating friction. This friction slows and eventually stops the brake drum’s turning, which stops the wheel.|$|R

50|$|A <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> is an {{air-operated}} valve {{typically used}} in air brake systems to remotely control the brakes {{at the rear}} of a heavy truck or semi-trailer in a tractor-trailer combination. Relay valves are necessary in heavy trucks in order to speed-up rear-brake application and release, since air takes longer to travel {{to the rear of the}} vehicle than the front of the vehicle, where the front service brakes, foot-valve, parking-control valve, and trailer-supply valve (if applicable) are located.|$|E
40|$|Electrodeposition {{processes}} were {{proposed for}} the fabrication of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) long time ago. Patterned layers of nickel, nickel alloys, gold alloys, silver and copper are used to realize micro switches, <b>relays,</b> <b>valves,</b> pumps, coils and gyroscopes. The metal layers have to meet the highest requirements on homogeneity, {{as well as on}} mechanical, electric or magnetic characteristics. The application of microelectroplating has to cope with specific effects influencing the electroplating conditions in the micrometer range. So, many efforts concentrate on the control and standardisation of microelectroplating processes. The suitability and application of electroplating methods will be exemplified by two concepts of a microrelay assigned for current loads of up to several amperes. The development of these microrelays is object of the project "MikroRel", partially funded by the German ministry for education and research (BMBF) ...|$|R
50|$|To build a {{functionally}} complete logic system, <b>relays,</b> <b>valves</b> (vacuum tubes), or transistors can be used. The simplest {{family of}} logic gates using bipolar transistors is called resistor-transistor logic (RTL). Unlike simple diode logic gates (which {{do not have}} a gain element), RTL gates can be cascaded indefinitely to produce more complex logic functions. RTL gates were used in early integrated circuits. For higher speed and better density, the resistors used in RTL were replaced by diodes resulting in diode-transistor logic (DTL). Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) then supplanted DTL. As integrated circuits became more complex, bipolar transistors were replaced with smaller field-effect transistors (MOSFETs); see PMOS and NMOS. To reduce power consumption still further, most contemporary chip implementations of digital systems now use CMOS logic. CMOS uses complementary (both n-channel and p-channel) MOSFET devices to achieve a high speed with low power dissipation.|$|R
25|$|Purely {{electronic}} circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, {{at the same}} time that digital calculation replaced analog. Machines such as the Z3, the Atanasoff–Berry Computer, the Colossus computers, and the ENIAC were built by hand, using circuits containing <b>relays</b> or <b>valves</b> (vacuum tubes), and often used punched cards or punched paper tape for input and as the main (non-volatile) storage medium.|$|R
50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} service brake {{circuits}}, the parking brake circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual service brake circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The service brakes are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The parking brake is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park brake <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake <b>relay</b> <b>valve.</b> The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer service brake hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|E
50|$|A {{spring brake}} <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as the service brake <b>relay</b> <b>valve,</b> although it has the opposite effect. This type of <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> responds to a major drop in pressure at its control-port by opening its exhaust port, which causes the air from each spring brake chamber under its control to remotely exhaust, thus applying the spring brakes much-more-quickly than would otherwise be possible if the air were required to discharge via the yellow parking-control valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs is fed into the supply-port of the parking-control valve, {{as well as the}} supply-port of this relay valve; it is merged via yet another two-way check valve. The delivery-port output of the parking-control valve connects to the control-port of this relay valve; this enables the spring brakes to be controlled via this valve. The merged air from the parking-control valve prevents air-loss from only one braking circuit from causing the spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location. However, with this increased control, comes increased responsibility {{on the part of the}} driver: If air is lost from the primary circuit alone, the spring brakes must be manually applied by the driver via the parking-control valve; otherwise, the front service brakes may not be enough to stop the vehicle safely in an emergency—especially if the vehicle is heavily loaded, and/or traveling at a high-speed. In fact, the driver's failure to manually apply the spring brakes in this situation could lead to catastrophic failure of the front brakes due to overheating, since it could cause the front service brakes to exceed their design-limit for energy absorption.QR1C air valve speeds up the process, with anti compounding, meaning trailer and service brakes will function 1 second between each other.The relay valve's function is analogous to the transistor used in electronic circuits.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} control the trailer service brakes, the merged outputs (i.e., merged via 2 two-way check valves {{connected}} in-series to give three inputs) of the foot-valve and trailer-hand-valve (if applicable) are directed through the tractor-protection valve, and onward towards the trailer <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> via the blue service line. In tractors that are not equipped with a trailer hand valve, only the merged outputs of the foot-valve (i.e., via a single two-way check valve) are directed towards the trailer relay valve; however, {{the fact that the}} foot-valve's delivery-port outputs are still merged enables the trailer's service brakes to still be controlled even if there is failure within one braking circuit of the tractor.|$|E

Although it was programmable, it was not general-purpose, being designed to perform only a single task. It also lacked the ability to store its program in memory; programming was carried out using plugs and switches to alter the internal wiring.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel technique for sensing direction, angle and velocity from rotation of shafts using simple Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) based micro-switches.

The result shows that SMA based angle encoder works efficiently and gives more accurate results under disturbance while optical encoders are quite sensitive to similar platform vibration. Due to its compactness and lightweight, this concept of SMA wire based angle sensor is envisaged to be suitable for structural health monitoring applications where discrete angle information is needed at low RPM. ...|$|R

30|$|Considering the {{hazardous}} nature of high-speed train operation, {{the assessment of}} vehicle reliability is essential to guarantee its safe operation. It is therefore necessary to assess the reliability of key components in high-speed trains, which represent issues that have been widely and thoroughly studied. Meng et al. [22] researched a reliability evaluation method using Markov model to describe the trend of the system reliability, and assessed the reliability of high-speed train traction transmission system. However, the system reliability needs research component reliability, which is statistical inference under small sample problem. Wang et al. [23] employed the least squares method to analyze {{the reliability of the}} key components of trains based on the Weibull distribution. The results of the study indicated that the sample size had a significant effect on the estimation precision. Wu et al. [24] assessed the reliability of <b>relay</b> <b>valves</b> based on the characteristic that the failure rate gradually increases according to an assumed Weibull distribution. Wang et al. [25] performed a durable test to evaluate the reliability of a brake unit for urban rail vehicles. The methods discussed above for the reliability assessment of high-speed trains can achieve satisfactory results under large sample size. Tian [26] employed a virtual expansion method to expand data sample size from n[*]=[*] 2 – 3 to n[*]=[*] 12, and then employed the method to analyze the reliability of the center sill and body bolster of a C 70 gondola car based on a Bayesian method. The authors assumed that the lifetimes of parts followed normal distributions, and the approach was demonstrated to improve the assessment precision. Zhu et al. [27] extended the Bayesian method to the Weibull distribution, and verified the robustness of the model by assessing the reliability of bearings in a high-speed train. Subjective selection was employed to define the prior distribution and its hyperparameters, and these estimators were solved using an analytical method. Dong [28] assessed the reliability of braking systems in urban railway vehicles using a goal-oriented (GO) methodology and Bayesian theory based on the assumption of an exponential distribution. The method was demonstrated to be suitable for analyzing conditions where a component follows the rule that the failure rate is constant. Akama [29] calculated the crack propagation rate of cracks in a Shinkansen vehicle axle using Bayesian analysis by combining crack propagation rates derived from small specimens with crack propagation rates derived from full-scale models. The results showed that the method can narrow the variance of the fatigue life distribution, and provide more confident failure probability values.|$|R

South African Universities Power Engineering Conference (SAUPEC), 30 - 31 January 2014, Durban, South Africa. The availability and depletion {{of natural resources}} is increasingly punted as the limiting factor for sustainability. A lot of focus is currently placed on the role and effect of fossil fuels as well as water conservation. One way to affect prudence with these scarce resources is to generally create timely awareness of consumption thereof, and also the related cost for the consumers. Existing metering solutions for electrical energy and water are often manually read by officials, and the information difficult to digest. Moreover, billing information, which serves as feedback, lags consumption by several weeks. Smart meters address many of these challenges by enabling electronic and real-time metering, but are still prohibitively expensive. In this paper, a low-cost power meter is discussed and also a novel low-cost water flow meter is developed to integrate into a household smart metering system. Electricity supply to appliances {{as well as the}} main water supply is controlled through <b>relays</b> and a <b>valve.</b> The whole system is connected to the Trintel SMART web platform by means of cellular communications from where end-users can manage their own energy and water usage.

40|$|Abstract In {{this thesis}} {{pre-stressed}} piezoelectric actuators for micro and fine mechanical applications have been developed. First, RAINBOW (Reduced And INternally Biased Oxide Wafer) and thick film actuators were manufactured and their electromechanical properties were characterised. In the second part, the novel pre-stressed piezoelectric actuator PRESTO (PRE-STressed electrOactive component {{by using a}} post-fired biasing layer) was developed and its electrical and electromechanical properties were measured. Commercial piezoelectric PZT 5 A and PZT 5 H discs {{were used in the}} RAINBOW and PRESTO actuators and PLZT paste for thick film actuators. The pre-stressing of the PRESTO actuators was based on the sintering shrinkage and different thermal expansion coefficient of the piezoelectric disc and passive material. Dielectric LTCC tape and AgPd paste were utilized as pre-stressing media and passive layer by using lamination and screen-printing, respectively. Different active and passive layer thicknesses and electrode materials were realized in order to obtain high displacements and good load bearing capability for actuators. The PRESTO actuators showed a significantly higher coercive electric field than their bulk counterparts, but a decreased remanent polarisation. The displacement as a function of load was measured under 0. 3 – 3  N loads and electric fields up to ± 0. 75 MV/m. The highest displacement of 118  μm was obtained with a 250  μm thick PZT 5 H actuator (Ø  25 mm) with LTCC tape (thickness ~ 96  μm) as the pre-stressing material. The corresponding actuator with AgPd pre-stressing material (thickness ~ 33  μm) produced 63  μm displacement. Additionally, PRESTO actuators were tested with a glued steel layer in a mechanical amplifier which obtained displacements up to 1. 2  mm. Effective d 31 coefficients of the PRESTO actuators were derived using an analysis based on unimorph model and measured displacement data. The actuators exhibited significantly enhanced effective d 31 coefficients (d 31 eff = - 690 pm/V and d 31 eff = - 994 pm/V for PZT 5 A and 5 H, respectively) comparable to the RAINBOW actuators. Mass-producible PRESTO actuators with high displacement, moderate load bearing capabilities and integration possibilities can be utilised in various micro and fine mechanical devices e. g. dosing devices, electromechanical locks, regulators, positioners vibrators, speakers, adjusters, pumps, <b>valves,</b> <b>relays,</b> dispensers, micromanipulators, etc...|$|R
