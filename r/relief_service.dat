Madero, who challenged Porfirio Díaz for the presidency in 1910, was jailed by Díaz but escaped and fled to Texas. Reports of the war, casualties and the refusal of the Red Cross to treat insurgents, caused Arizmendi to return to Mexico City via train on 17 April 1911. Once there, she arranged a personal meeting {{with the head of the}} Red Cross organization. When the director reiterated that they would not treat revolutionaries, Arizmendi decided to found an organization that would treat her countrymen.

[...] The DRS bought cattle in counties which were designated emergency areas, for $14 to $20 a head. [...] Animals determined {{unfit for human consumption}} were killed; {{at the beginning of the}} program, more than 50 percent were so designated in emergency areas. The DRS assigned the remaining cattle to the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC) to be used in food distribution to families nationwide. [...] Although it was difficult for farmers to give up their herds, the cattle slaughter program helped many of them avoid bankruptcy. [...] "The government cattle buying program was a blessing to many farmers, as they could not afford to keep their cattle, and the government paid a better price than they could obtain in local markets." ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} has been to propose a model <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> {{facility}} for senior citizens in the region Trhové Sviny {{on the basis of}} results of an analysis of the regions potential and needs. The current offer of services for seniors has been identified, including the possible necessity of extending this offer by facilities providing <b>relief</b> <b>services.</b> The non-governmental organisation Borůvka, Borovany providing <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> to families with handicapped children would welcome an expansion of <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> and therefore {{it is likely that the}} project will be implemented in co-operation with this non-governmental organisation. In the theoretical part, the target group of the model facility is described first. Good knowledge of the recipients of the service [...] in this case senior citizens [...] is a basic prerequisite for creating adequate services. Furthermore, social services that are suitable for seniors are described in this part, with a special focus on <b>relief</b> <b>services.</b> The history of <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> has been mentioned, including their models, forms and the contents of these services. The family and the senior are also described here. The practical part describes the current offer of services for seniors in the region Trhové Sviny. A SWOT analysis for the proposed facility has been processed in this part. Furthermore, the characteristics of the model facility and its operation are described in detail in the practical part so that the facility could be created. This part contains the details of the projects aim, sphere of activity, characteristics of the target group and specific description of individual services, methods and forms of work in the facility, staffing, possible sources of financing and expected expenses and the technical solution of the entire project. This thesis should serve as a manual for the implementing the new <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> facility, which should be created in the future in co-operation with the non-governmental organisation Borůvka, Borovany. Moreover, this thesis provides a complex overview of <b>relief</b> <b>services</b> in general and it may serve as full information source for the general public...|$|R
