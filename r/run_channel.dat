Radio remains the most important medium, particularly for dispersed herdsman in the countryside. There are {{a large number of}} radio stations, both national and foreign, mainly based in Ulaanbaatar. Around 115 FM and 7 AM stations were on air in 2006, including the BBC World Service, Voice of America and other foreign stations. Radio broadcasts are in Mongolian, Russian and English.
