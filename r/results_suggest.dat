5|$|A 1996 {{molecular}} {{analysis of}} 38 different Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus. The <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that S.pungens was genetically similar to S.collinitus, S.neoalbidipes, S.pseudobrevipes, S.luteus, S.brevipes, S.weaverae, and certain isolates of S.granulatus.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that wild Asiatic dayflower populations found growing on copper mine spoils in eastern China {{exhibited}} very high concentrations of copper within the plants, more so than the 48 species tested. Commelina communis had sequestered some 361mg/kg of copper, while the plant with the next highest concentration, Polygonum macrathum, had 286mg/kg. Five of the species examined, including the Asiatic dayflower, also showed high concentrations of other metals such as zinc, lead, and cadmium. The <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that the Asiatic dayflower is a good candidate for copper mine spoil revegetation and phytoremediation.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of the Amylostereaceae {{is not completely}} resolved. The next closest relatives might be – depending on the research – either Echinodontium tinctorium and most other species of the genus Echinodontium, or Artomyces pyxidatus. Most of the previous DNA analysis <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> a narrow relation to Echinodontium, but several results of studies partially contradict this conclusion. Only the classification to the Russulales is regarded as correct. Some authors have suggested that Amylostereum should {{be placed in the}} family Echinodontiaceae.|$|E

25|$|In psoriatic {{arthritis}} (PsA), inhibitors of TNF, such as infliximab, improve {{the signs and}} symptoms. Several therapies with modest efficacy have been studied in nail psoriasis. Among available agents, higher quality data are available to support the efficacy of cyclosporine and infliximab. Based on studies in AS, the <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab {{have the potential to}} reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severely active axial involvement in PsA in patients who have had an inadequate response to NSAID (level 1a, grade A). The anti-TNF agents (infliximab and etanercept; level 1b, grade A) are more effective for the treatment of enthesitis than traditional agents. <b>Results</b> <b>suggest</b> infliximab is effective for the treatment of dactylitis in PsA.|$|E

25|$|Direct {{electrical}} {{stimulation of the}} ARAS produces pain responses in cats and educes verbal reports of pain in humans.

40|$|The {{collateral}} {{effects of}} response blocking were evaluated while treating stereotypic {{behavior in a}} woman diagnosed with autism. Blocking stereotypic behavior (head and tooth capping) was associated with decreases in leisure-item interaction and increases in another stereotypic response (hand wringing). <b>Results</b> <b>suggested</b> that the reduction in item interaction was due to adventitious punishment.

25|$|Of the 1.5 million Laysan Albatrosses that inhabit Midway, {{nearly all}} {{are found to}} have plastic in their {{digestive}} system. Approximately one-third of the chicks die.
