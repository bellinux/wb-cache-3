25|$|The Golden Bridge. It {{was built}} by the British in 1881 across the Narmada River to improve access to traders and administrators to Bombay. The {{structure}} was built with <b>rust-resistant</b> iron, and therefore, more expensive than modern steel, lending to the name Golden Bridge. This bridge connects Bharuch and Ankleshwar.|$|E
25|$|Each bus is {{constructed}} with passengers' safety in mind. For example, the body frame {{is constructed}} using Galvanyl (Zn - Fe Alloy), {{a strong and}} <b>rust-resistant</b> metal. There are also eight or ten glass-shattering hammers mounted {{on some of the}} window frames, and three emergency doors for fast evacuation during an emergency. There are also two fire extinguishers at the front and back of the buses.|$|E
25|$|Plants whose traits can be {{modified}} to survive a disease or insect have made inroads into Canadian agricultural practices. Cereal rusts which can destroy the majority of areas seeded to wheat, was controlled in 1938 by breeding strains which were <b>rust-resistant.</b> This strain was successful until around 1950, when again a new variety of rust broke out, and again a new species of wheat called Selkirk was developed which was rust resistant. Biotechnology {{is the center of}} new research and regulations affecting agriculture this century.|$|E
25|$|Some of Baird's early inventions {{were not}} fully successful. In his twenties {{he tried to}} create {{diamonds}} by heating graphite and shorted out Glasgow's electricity supply. Later Baird invented a glass razor, which was <b>rust-resistant,</b> but shattered. Inspired by pneumatic tyres he attempted to make pneumatic shoes, but his prototype contained semi-inflated balloons, which burst. He also invented a thermal undersock (the Baird undersock), which was moderately successful. Baird suffered from cold feet, and {{after a number of}} trials, he found that an extra layer of cotton inside the sock provided warmth.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Larker', a six-rowed, semi-smooth-awn malting barley, {{was first}} {{released}} in 1961. It was medium-maturity with moderate straw strength and medium height. 'Larker' was <b>rust-resistant,</b> but susceptible to leaf diseases and loose smut. It {{was superior to}} all other malt varieties for kernel plumpness {{at the time of}} release.|$|E
2500|$|The {{research}} attracted global attention, {{particularly from}} scientists in grain-growing nations dealing with productivity losses from stem rust. She was {{by this time}} internationally regarded as an authority on plant rusts, and represented Canada at scientific conventions in the United States, Europe, and Russia. Her research was economically significant, as {{it was used to}} develop <b>rust-resistant</b> wheat cultivars and resulted in a [...] "reduction of annual losses of wheat due to rust from 30 million bushels to practically none". Wheat rust is no longer a significant problem in Canada.|$|E

50|$|The only {{drawback}} of 'Marquis' was its {{susceptibility to}} rust. Not until 1947 was a <b>rust-resistant</b> variety {{developed at the}} Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa. It was named 'Saunders'.|$|E
50|$|The iron {{pillar of}} Delhi is a 7 m {{column in the}} Qutb complex at Mehrauli in Delhi, India. It is notable for the <b>rust-resistant</b> {{composition}} of the metals used in its construction.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} design used low grade (non-strategic) steel, which was later {{replaced by a}} more <b>rust-resistant</b> version. The United States used an all-spruce 'Pacific Hut' in the Pacific Theater of Operations in World War II.|$|E
50|$|Seymchan {{belongs to}} Main Group pallasites, {{but it is}} {{considered}} anomalous due to its high Iridium content. Before the discovery of its pallasitic structure it had been classified as IIE anomalous coarse octahedrite. Seymchan is considered a stable and <b>rust-resistant</b> pallasite.|$|E
50|$|At {{its most}} active during the 1940s, the mine {{produced}} 2,500 tons of micaceous haematite per year. The mineral {{was an important}} ingredient in the <b>rust-resistant</b> paint used on Royal Navy ships and on bridges, including the Royal Albert Bridge and the Sydney Harbour Bridge.|$|E
50|$|In Central and Southern New Jersey, bog ore was mined {{and refined}} for the {{production}} of naturally <b>rust-resistant</b> tools and wrought iron rails, many of which still grace staircases in Trenton and Camden. During the American Revolution, bog iron cannonballs were cast for the colonial forces.|$|E
5000|$|Martin H. Dubilier (1926 - 1991) was an American {{businessman}} and an inventor, {{a co-founder of}} Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, who invented a <b>rust-resistant</b> train track {{at the age of}} 12 and low voltage flash bulbs eliminating the need for battery packs - at age 18.|$|E

5000|$|Resistance to the blister rust is genetic, {{and due to}} Western white pine's genetic {{variability}} {{some individuals}} are relatively unaffected by the rust. The Forest Service has a program for locating and breeding <b>rust-resistant</b> Western white pine and sugar pine. Seedlings of these trees have been introduced into the wild.|$|E
50|$|Gullett {{had a long}} {{association}} with Canberra - he {{had spent most of}} his childhood there, and in married life, he took up the lease on Lambrigg station, the ACT rural property which had earlier been home to William Farrer during the time when he developed an important strain of <b>rust-resistant</b> wheat.|$|E
5000|$|Post-independence, the {{institute}} renamed Indian Agricultural Research Institute, and in 1950 the Shimla sub-station of institute developed <b>Rust-resistant</b> varieties of wheat, including Pusa 718, 737, 745, and 760. In 1958, it {{was recognized as}} a [...] "deemed university" [...] under the UGC act of 1956 of Parliament and since then it has awarded MSc and PhD degrees.|$|E
5000|$|Stainless steel, {{also known}} as [...] "inox steel" [...] does not stain, corrode, or rust as easily as {{ordinary}} steel. Pierre Berthier, a Frenchman, {{was the first to}} notice the <b>rust-resistant</b> properties of mixing chromium with alloys in 1821, which led to new metal treating and metallurgy processes and eventually the creation of usable stainless steel. DeLorean cars had stainless steel bodies.|$|E
50|$|Blades {{are usually}} made of <b>rust-resistant</b> {{stainless}} steel.Ceramic cutters are available; {{they are not}} subject to corrosion, and stay sharper longer because of a higher resistance to wear than metal blades. They remain cool to the touch even with fairly prolonged use, as ceramic is a poor heat conductor. However, ceramic blades are brittle and easily broken, and more expensive to replace than metal blades.|$|E

50|$|It {{was later}} bought by General Foods, {{then by the}} late 1960s was sold to Miles Laboratories. In the mid-1990s, the {{manufacturer}} began advertising that S.O.S pads had been made <b>rust-resistant.</b> In fact the pads were so well-protected against rust, and the pads lasted so much longer, that Miles removed the rust-inhibiting ingredients and ceased to advertise the pad's rust resistant quality. Later, Miles sold the brand to Clorox.|$|E
50|$|This 12 gauge smoothbore firearm has a 14-inch (36 cm) {{barrel and}} has a <b>rust-resistant</b> parkerized finish. It is a close copy of the Remington 870, a widely {{distributed}} design no longer under patent protection, and most parts interchange freely. Compact, reliable, and affordable, it is popular with hunters and others working or recreating in grizzly bear habitat. The perpetrator of the Dawson College shooting was armed with an HP9-1-14.00.|$|E
50|$|Kharchia 65 is a derived {{cultivar}} of Kharchia local {{developed through}} back cross breeding with a <b>rust-resistant</b> type. In India {{most of the}} improved salinity-resistant varieties have been developed using Kharchia 65 as base material and {{is used as a}} standard for the salt tolerance test of wheat worldwide. Yield of about 10-20 Q/ha. have been reported for Kharchia irrigated with waters having less than 10 mmhos/cm (=6400 ppm or 6400 mg/l approx).|$|E
50|$|In 1911, Sutton was {{appointed}} agricultural commissioner for the Western Australian wheat belt. Drought affected wheat yields {{in the years}} after Sutton's appointment, he cross-bred varieties to produce the wheat leaf <b>rust-resistant,</b> Nabawa.From 1 July 1921 until 31 October 1937, Sutton was Director of Agriculture in Western Australia — the first to hold this role.Sutton produced a new standard for wheat, 'W.A. Standard White' which went further than the previous 'Fair Average Quality' standard which had been in use in Australia.|$|E
