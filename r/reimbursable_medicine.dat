Neskatoties uz to, ka zāļu kompensācija Latvijas mediju vidē tiek bieži apspriesta, ir tādi jautājumi, kuru atklāšanai ir būtiska nozīme pacientu tiesību nodrošināšanā. Darba pirmajā daļā autors sniedz vispārēju pārskatu par zāļu kompensācijas valsts politiku, normatīvo regulējumu un faktiski sniegto zāļu kompensācijas struktūru 2011. gadā. Darba otrajā daļā tiek analizēta kompensējamo zāļu A un B sarakstā iekļauto medikamentu kompensācijas atteikuma tiesiskā daba. Tiek pamatota hipotēze, ka kompensējamo zāļu A un B sarakstā iekļauto medikamentu kompensācijas atteikums ir publisko tiesību jomā un ir vērtējams kā faktiskā rīcība. Saskaņā ar šo teoriju nepieciešams nošķirt ārstniecības personas rīcību ārstniecības jomā, kas ir balstīta uz privātpersonu brīvu gribu un rīcību, kurai ir raksturīgs zināms valsts piespiedu elements. Darba trešajā daļā tiek pētīts jautājums par kompensējamo zāļu C sarakstā iekļauto medikamentu kompensācijas atteikumu tiesisko dabu un to atbilstību tiesību principiem. Tiek pamatota hipotēze, ka kompensējamo zāļu C sarakstā iekļauto medikamentu kompensācijas atteikums pamatojoties uz to, ka ir sasniegts noteikts pacientu skaits, nesamērīgi ierobežo pacientu tiesības uz veselību. Salīdzinājumam tiek analizēts līdzīgs regulējums veselības aprūpes jomā, kas ir vairāk saudzējošs pacientiem. Darba ceturtajā daļā tiek pētīts jautājums par zāļu kompensācijas atteikumu individuālajā kārtā tiesisko dabu un to atbilstību tiesību principiem. Tiek pamatota hipotēze, ka zāļu kompensācijas atteikums individuālajiem pacientiem, pamatojoties uz to, ka ir sasniegts individuālajām kompensācijām atvēlētais finansējums, nesamērīgi ierobežo pacientu tiesības uz veselību. In {{this work}} the author {{analysed}} the legislation of medicine reimbursement in Latvia. The medicine reimbursement are often discussed in media environment of Latvia, despite this still are questions which {{are essential to}} clarify for patients to understand their rights. In {{the first section of}} this work the author provides a general overview of the state policy of the medicine reimbursement, legislation and structure of the medicine reimbursement in 2011. In the second section of this work the author analyzed the legal basis of refusal reimburse medicines which are included in the reimbursement lists A and B. The author defends the hypothesis, that denial of reimbursement of the medicine, which are included in reimbursement lists A and B, are in a scope of public law and should be viewed as the actual action in administrative law. According to this theory necessary separate actions of the medicine personnel as a treatment of the patients, which are based on free will of the parties’, from the actions of the medicine personnel by denial of reimbursement of the medicine included in reimbursement lists A and B, which have some coercive element of the State relations. In the third section of the work the author analyzed the legal nature of the issue of refusal of <b>reimbursable</b> <b>medicine</b> which are included in the reimbursement lists C and such refusal compliance with the principles of the law. The author defends hypothesis that refusal reimburse medicines on the ground of reason that were reached certain number of patients, which are declared by the State authority as a reimbursable, is disproportional and restricts patients' right to health. For the solution of the problem the author analyzes a similar legislation in the health care and proves that the state could introduce more respectful regulation for patients. In the fourth section of the work the author analyzed the legal nature of the issue when the State authority refuses to reimburse the medicine in an individual cases and such refusal compliance with the principles of the law. The author defends hypothesis, that the refuse reimburse the medicine in a individual cases on the ground of a reason that there were reached certain percentage of allowed funding for individual cases, in some cases could disproportionately restrict the patients' right to health. For the solution of the problem the author analyzes judgments and proves that there could be more respectful regulation for individual patients...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{perform a}} {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement systems in Croatia and the 27 European Union (EU) Member States. Methods Knowledge about the pharmaceutical systems in Croatia and the 27 EU Member States was acquired by literature review and primary research with stakeholders. Results Pharmaceutical prices are controlled at all levels in Croatia, {{which is also the}} case in 21 EU Member States. Like many EU countries, Croatia also applies external price referencing, ie, compares prices with other countries. While the wholesale remuneration by a statutorily regulated linear mark-up is applied in Croatia and in several EU countries, the pharmacy compensation for dispensing <b>reimbursable</b> <b>medicines</b> {{in the form of a}} flat rate service fee in Croatia is rare among EU countries, which usually apply a linear or regressive pharmacy mark-up scheme. Like in most EU countries, the Croatian Social Insurance reimburses specific medicines at 100 %, whereas patients are charged copayments for other <b>reimbursable</b> <b>medicines.</b> Criteria for reimbursement include the medicine’s importance from the public health perspective, its therapeutic value, and relative effectiveness. In Croatia and in many EU Member States, reimbursement is based on a reference price system. Conclusion The Croatian pharmaceutical system is similar to those in the EU Member States. Key policies, like external price referencing and reference price systems, which have increasingly been introduced in EU countries are also applied in Croatia and serve the same purpose: to ensure access to medicines while containing public pharmaceutical expenditur...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: To {{describe}} pharmaceutical {{pricing and}} reimbursement systems in 29 European countries {{with regard to}} medicines, particularly generics, and their possible impact on generics uptake. Method: Data collection on pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement policies with the staff of competent authorities. Results: In most European countries the prices of medicines are controlled at the stage of manufacture (ex-factory price) or wholesale. Usually, price control systems target <b>reimbursable</b> <b>medicines,</b> and the prices of reimbursable generics are regulated. Sixteen of the 29 countries surveyed in this study apply a policy of generic price linkage, i. e. setting {{the price of the}} generic medicines at a specific percentage lower than that of the originator. Twenty-two of the surveyed countries run a reference price system, i. e. a reimbursement policy based on clusters of identical or similar medicines for which a fixed amount of reimbursement is granted. Most countries cluster medicines with the same active ingredient, and only a few countries have opted for broader reference groups, thus allowing more interchangeability between choice of medicines and higher savings on costs. Demand-side measures such as generics substitution and/or prescribing by the international non-proprietary name are in place in nearly all the countries surveyed. These are usually not mandatory for the stakeholders concerned. Conclusion: As many pharmaceutical policies tend to address <b>reimbursable</b> <b>medicines,</b> generics fall under the scope of these measures. European countries apply a mix of specific measures to promote generics uptake. There appears to be room for improvement regarding the enforcement of some policies...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} public health care {{expenditure}} is one of major concerns for health policy makers across industrialised Countries, especially {{in a period of}} recession as the present one. In the quest to control costs, public health care systems control the prices of <b>reimbursable</b> <b>medicines</b> by combining listing with several instruments ranging from external reference pricing to cost-effectiveness thresholds to value-based schemes (e. g. risk-sharing). The aim of these regulatory mechanisms is to find an optimal trade-off between the need to incentivate R&D, consumers’ protection and value for money in the use of public funds. However, the regulations and restrictions laid down by Government agencies in this sector are themselves a source of distortion. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the effects of listing and risk-sharing in the market for new, innovative drugs. We will study the introduction of these schemes under different rules as concerns the negotiation process and risksharing arrangements. Finally, we will review the empirical evidence on the effects that regulation has on innovation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To examine, for {{essential}} anti-cancer medicines, {{the alignment}} of national lists of essential <b>medicines</b> and national <b>reimbursable</b> <b>medicines</b> lists with the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Model Lists. Methods: National medicine lists for 135 countries with per-capita gross national incomes below 25 000 United States dollars in 2015 {{were compared with}} WHO's 2013 and 2015 Model Lists of Essential Medicines. Correlations between numbers of anti-cancer medicines included in national lists and gross national income (GNI), government health expenditure and number of physicians per 1000 population were evaluated. Findings: Of the 25 anti-cancer medicines on the 2013 Model List and the 16 added via the 2015 revision of the Model List, 0 - 25 (median: 17) and 0 - 15 (median: 3) appeared in national lists, respectively. There was considerable variability in these numbers within and between World Bank income groups. Of the 16 new medicines included in the 2015 Model List, for example, 0 - 10 (median: 1) and 2 - 15 (median: 10) {{were included in the}} national lists of low-income and high-income countries, respectively. The numbers of these new medicines included in national lists were significantly correlated (P≤ 0. 0001) with per-capita GNI (r= 0. 45), per-capita annual government health expenditure (r= 0. 33) and number of physicians per 1000 population (r= 0. 48). Twenty-one countries (16 %) included the targeted anti-cancer medicines imatinib, rituximab and trastuzumab in their national lists. Conclusion: Substantial numbers of anti-cancer medicines are included in national lists of low- and middle-income countries but the availability, affordability, accessibility and administration feasibility of these medicines, at country-level, need assessment...|$|R
40|$|The Essential Medicines Working Group of the International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) has {{proposed}} a list of antineoplastic drugs that should be available in low and middle income countries. Data were extracted on the listing of 18 essential and 8 ancillary antineoplastic medicines in the national essential medicines lists (NEMLs) or national <b>reimbursable</b> <b>medicines</b> lists (NRMLs) of 135 countries with gross national income (GNI) per capita of less than US $ 25, 000. Correlations between numbers of medicines listed and GNI per capita, annual government health expenditure (AGHE) per capita, {{and the number of}} physicians per million people were examined. Listing of the 18 essential antineoplastic drugs ranged from 27 % (thioguanine) to 95 % (methotrexate). The median number of medicines listed was 7 (0 - 18) in low income countries (n = 26) and 14 in lower-middle (n = 42), upper-middle (n = 44), and high income countries (n = 20). For the ancillary eight medicines, the median was one (0 - 8) across the 135 countries. Correlations with GNI per capita (r = 0. 17, P = 0. 0266) and physician density (r = 0. 25, P = 0. 0017) were statistically significant; not so for AGHE per capita (r = 0. 00, P = 0. 5000). There was large variability within income groups in numbers of antineoplastic agents identified as essential in NEMLs and NRMLs. While not a direct measure of availability, listing is an important step, guiding procurement for the public sector. These results focus attention on deficits in NEMLs and NMRLs as a step to improving access to effective antineoplastic medicines for cancers in children in low and middle income countries...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several {{surveys in}} the last 50 years have {{repeatedly}} indicated that Belgium is affected by mild iodine deficiency. Within {{the framework of the}} national food and health plan in Belgium, a selective, progressive, and monitored strategy was proposed in 2009 to optimize iodine intake. The objective {{of the present study was}} to perform a health economic evaluation of the consequences of inadequate iodine intake in Belgium, focusing on undisputed and measurable health outcomes such as thyroid nodular disease and its associated morbidity (hyperthyroidism). Methods: For the estimation of direct, indirect, medical, and nonmedical costs related to thyroid nodular diseases in Belgium, data from the Federal Public Service of Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment, the National Institute for Disease and Disability Insurance (RIZIV/INAMI), the Information Network about the prescription of <b>reimbursable</b> <b>medicines</b> (FARMANET), Intercontinental Marketing Services, and expert opinions were used. These costs translate into savings after implementation of the iodization program and are defined as costs due to thyroid nodular disease throughout the article. Costs related to the iodization program are referred to as program costs. Only figures dating from before the start of the intervention were exploited. Only adult and elderly people (>= 18 years) were taken into account in this study because thyroid nodular diseases predominantly affect this age group. Results: The yearly costs due to thyroid nodular diseases caused by mild iodine deficiency in the Belgian adult population are similar to(sic) 38 million. It is expected that the iodization program will result in additional costs of similar to(sic) 54, 000 per year and decrease the prevalence of thyroid nodular diseases by 38 % after a 4 - 5 -year period. The net savings after establishment of the program are therefore estimated to be at least (sic) 14 million a year. Conclusions: Optimization of iodine intake in Belgium should be quite cost effective, if only considering its impact on nodular thyroid disease. There are likely added benefits relating to more optimal thyroid hormone influenced brain development that are more difficult to estimate but may be even more important...|$|R

Supply of medicines on Positive list (PL) reimbursable by Healt Insurance Fund (HIF) was done centrally by international tenders util 2004. Main selection criteria for best tender offer was medicines price, which determinated their PL price. Reference pricing (RP) rules from 2009 use comparative analysis of prices in referent countries in the region. Reference price is the highest amount that HIF reimburses for particular prescription medicine. Objectives Impact of RP methodology on 1) prices of nationally most consumed medicine, 2) financial affordability of PL medicines for eight selected clinical conditions related to av. monthly wages, 3) number of same INN of medicines on the market.
