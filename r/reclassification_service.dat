50|$|Deposit <b>Reclassification,</b> {{the primary}} <b>service</b> {{provided}} by fi-linx, provides an automated method for credit unions to reclassify their deposit accounts to significantly lower their Federal Reserve balance. This {{is done by}} splitting each transaction account into a checking subaccount (which carries a reserve requirement) and a savings subaccount (which does not carry a reserve requirement), a process allowed by the Federal Reserve Bank in 1993. The service {{has been reported to}} have saved Maps Credit Union $145,000 per year and it is estimated that $154 million could be saved industry-wide if every credit union were to use the service. Check Checker is a form of check fraud deterrent software that uses real-time validation to check the routing number of a check with the Federal Reserve, as well as checking fraud alerts from the National Credit Union Administration and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.|$|R

40|$|A 1 : A {{petition}} is {{a request}} filed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by an interested party asking that a species be listed on, delisted from, or reclassified on the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. Q 2 : What is a 90 -day Finding? A 2 : Section 4 (b) (3) (A) of the ESA requires the Service {{to make a}} finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents substantial scientific or commercial information (see Q 6 below {{for more information on}} this standard) indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. The Service bases this finding on information provided in the petition, supporting information submitted with the petition, and information otherwise available in our files at the time the petition was received. To the maximum extent practicable, the Service is to make this finding within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and publish notice of this finding in the Federal Register. Q 3 : Who petitioned the Service and what did they request? A 3 : On December 14, 2012, the Service received a petition requesting that the West Indian manatee and its subspecies, the Florida manatee and Antillean manatee, be reclassified from endangered to threatened under the ESA. The petition was submitted by the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF), on behalf of Save Crystal River, Inc., and included as supporting information an analysis of the Service’s 2007 West Indian Manatee Five-Year Review which recommended <b>reclassification.</b> The <b>Service</b> subsequently sent letters to the petitioner o...|$|R

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on two Supreme Court decisions, King v. Burwell and FCC v. Fox Televisions Stations, Inc., that provide {{diametrically}} different models for how deferential a court should be when it reviews administrative action. The former case addresses how deferential a court should be for an agency’s statutory interpretation of an ambiguous statute for a question that has significant economic and political effects but Congress had not expressly delegated the question to the agency. The latter case addresses how deferential a court should be when an agency’s changes a policy that is within its statutory authority. These two cases are briefly explained and then applied to the specific circumstances of the Federal Communications Commission’s 2015 Open Internet Order and the 2016 D. C. Circuit’s review of the action. This administrative action involved a <b>reclassification</b> of broadband <b>service</b> and generated substantial public comment and political posturing. If the Supreme Court decides to hear an appeal of the D. C. Circuit’s upholding of the agency action, then {{there is now a}} realistic possibility that the Court ignores the agency’s statutory interpretation in its entirety and reserves for itself resolution of the question. However, if the Court grants Chevron deference to the agency, there is a strong probability that it will find the agency’s change in policy a reasonable policy choice...|$|R
40|$|CHILD WELFARE {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} fields of {{practice}} in social work, and one in which social work has been the profession principally respon-sible for its operation. However, child welfare practice in the public sector has been affected by a variety of factors, in-cluding increasing professionalization, which has skewed the social work mis-sion away from the poor and disadvan-taged; contracting of services to the private sector; declassification and <b>reclassification</b> of social <b>service</b> posi-tions; and lack of inducements to enter the public sector (Lieberman, Hornby, & Russell, 1988). The societal context within which these events have oc-curred is characterized by devaluation of children; negation of people's needs (especially those of the poor); denial of social problems; and valuation of lack of interference in family life. Social work-ers have noted with concern a perceived move away from the profession's histor-ic mission to serve the oppressed and disadvantaged, an increase in private practice serving more advantaged cli-ents, the enhanced status of some fields of practice, and the devalued status of other fields such as public child welfare. The impact of these trends is reflec-ted in education for the practice of public child welfare. Many child welfare agency personnel have been disillu-sioned with graduate social work train-ing that they perceived to be incongru-ent with the nature of agency practice (Stein, 1982). A manifestation of this point of view has been the creation of graduate child welfare degrees that do not have a basis in social work (O'Neil & Wilson-Coker, 1986). However, social workers do continue to enter the public child welfare sector. A recent study (Lieberman, Hornby, & Russell, 1988) compared current educational back-grounds of public child welfare person-nel in 16 states with data from a study by Shyne and Schroeder (1978). The Lieberman et al. study documented...|$|R
40|$|Cost {{shifting}} is {{an organizational}} strategy to improve organizational profitability and to rationalise {{the arguments for}} survival or continuity. The extant literature provides ample evidence of its routine use in organizations with two pronged operating structure, a competitive segment and a monopoly segment. Cost shifting strategy {{has been used in}} the defense, health care and regulated monopolies for centuries. The use of cost shifting strategy in government funded regulated organizations in Australia is only a recent addition to extant practice. The current qualitative case study empirically investigates the conventional wisdom that cost shifting is an effective organizational strategy to rationalise survival of business segments. To validate this conventional wisdom, the study is undertaken in a budget constrained government organization in Australia. Using archival data, semi-structured and focused group interviews, the study explores if the organization studied benefited from cost shifting strategy to rationalise operations of one of its competitive segments. The competitive segment had to undergo mandatory market testing and competitive bidding exercise to justify the efficiency of its in-house provision and to comply with the accountability obligations to different stakeholders such as the local and state governments. The case study evidence was analysed by patterns and themes. The study finds that the organization used cost shifting strategically within the stricter codes of conduct of different regulatory and reporting frameworks, managed to save costs, and was successful in receiving stakeholder endorsement on in-house provision of the service. However, the cost shifting arrangement imposed a number of operational risks on other parts (the monopoly units) of the organization. The monopoly segments feared future regulatory scrutiny for exceeding budgetary expenditure thresholds and <b>reclassification</b> of their <b>services</b> as competitive <b>services.</b> Such <b>reclassification</b> was envisaged as harmful by some important users and was contrary to the organization’s agendas on some important services (e. g., aged care, meals on wheels). The findings of the study implies that cost shifting strategy may be repeatedly used {{in the absence of any}} regulatory oversight and stakeholders sanctions on funds for service provisions. However, if cost shifting imbalances expenditure thresholds and imposes risks on any organizational unit, then longer term solutions such as cost reductions or productivity improvements need to be contemplated. So, government organizations following such cost shifting practice and likely to anticipate regulatory oversight on such manipulative practice will benefit from the insights gleaned from this paper...|$|R
