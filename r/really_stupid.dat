After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something <b>really</b> <b>stupid,</b> it is best to admit it.|$|E
25|$|Edmonds later (to Liddell Hart in 1937 {{and in his}} own {{unpublished}} memoirs) told {{an exaggerated}} version of these events, that Wilson had stitched up the job for himself whilst acting as Director of Staff Duties, by recommending May ("a <b>really</b> <b>stupid</b> Irishman") for the job and placing himself as the second recommendation. Tim Travers (in The Killing Ground, 1987) used this story to help {{paint a picture of}} a prewar Army highly dependent on patronage for senior appointments. John Hussey, in his research into the matter, described Wilson’s appointment as “a collegiate decision about a difficult but suitable man” and dismisses Edmonds’ story as “worthless as evidence to prove anything about the structural defects of the old Army”. Keith Jeffrey argues that Travers’ argument is not entirely without substance – even if he is misinformed about this particular incident – and that Wilson’s career took place at “a transitional period” in which the Army was becoming more professionalised, so that Lyttelton was not able to use patronage to appoint May, his preferred candidate.|$|E

"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe" [...] {{was written}} by head writer and {{executive}} producer Steven Moffat, who {{wanted it to be}} [...] "the most Christmassy Christmas special ever". He stated that [...] "nothing is more fun to write" [...] than the Doctor at Christmas, as he considered it [...] "his kind of day. Everything's bright and shiny, everybody's having a laugh, and nobody minds if you wear a <b>really</b> <b>stupid</b> hat". The story is partly inspired by The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (from The Chronicles of Narnia) by C. S. Lewis. Moffat said that Doctor Who and the Narnia stories [...] "come from the same impulse that children have of escaping to another world." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard {{to know where to}} start dishing out the praise— Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of when you think of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are <b>really</b> <b>stupid</b> and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2005, then-Harvard {{assistant}} coach Bill Holden saw that Lin was [...] tall, which fit the physical attributes he was seeking, {{and he had}} a 4.2 grade point average in high school, which met Harvard's academic standards. But Holden was initially unimpressed with Lin's on-court abilities, and told Lin's high school basketball coach, Peter Diepenbrock, that Lin was a [...] "Division III player". Later that week, Holden saw Lin playing in a much more competitive game, driving to the basket at every opportunity with the [...] "instincts of a killer", and Lin became a top priority for him. Harvard coaches feared that Stanford, close to Lin's home, would offer Lin a scholarship, but it did not, and Lin chose to attend Harvard. [...] "I wasn't sitting there saying all these Division I coaches were knuckleheads," [...] Diepenbrock said. [...] "There were legitimate questions about Jeremy." [...] Joe Lacob, incoming Warriors owner and Stanford booster, said Stanford's failure to recruit Lin [...] "was <b>really</b> <b>stupid.</b> The kid was right across the street. [...] you can't recognize that, you've got a problem." [...] Kerry Keating, the UCLA assistant who offered Lin the opportunity to walk-on, said in hindsight that Lin would probably have ended up starting at point guard for UCLA.|$|E

500|$|As a child, Rodham was a {{favorite}} student of her teachers at the public schools that she attended in Park Ridge. She participated in sports such as swimming and baseball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout.

2500|$|Figgis had {{problems}} because permits were not issued for some street scenes. This {{caused him to}} film some scenes on the Las Vegas strip in one take to avoid the police, which Figgis said benefited production and {{the authenticity of the}} acting, remarking [...] "I've always hated the convention of shooting on a street, and then having to stop the traffic, and then having to tell the actors, 'Well, there's meant to be traffic here, so you're going to have to shout'. And they're shouting, but it's quiet and they feel <b>really</b> <b>stupid,</b> because it's unnatural.
