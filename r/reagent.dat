40|$|Abstract Background The current ‘gold standard’ for {{serotyping}} pneumococci is the Quellung test. This {{technique is}} laborious and requires {{a certain level}} of training to correctly perform. Commercial pneumococcal latex agglutination serotyping <b>reagents</b> are available, but these are expensive. In-house production of latex agglutination <b>reagents</b> can be a cost-effective alternative to using commercially available <b>reagents.</b> This paper describes a method for the production and quality control (QC) of latex <b>reagents,</b> including problem solving recommendations, for pneumococcal serotyping. Results Here we describe a method for the production of latex agglutination <b>reagents</b> based on the passive adsorption of antibodies to latex particles. Sixty-five latex agglutination <b>reagents</b> were made using the PneuCarriage Project (PCP) method, of which 35 passed QC. The other 30 <b>reagents</b> failed QC due to auto-agglutination (n= 2), no reactivity with target serotypes (n= 8) or cross-reactivity with non-target serotypes (n= 20). Dilution of antisera resulted in a further 27 <b>reagents</b> passing QC. The remaining three <b>reagents</b> passed QC when prepared without centrifugation and wash steps. Protein estimates indicated that latex <b>reagents</b> that failed QC when prepared using the PCP method passed when made with antiserum containing ≤ 500 μg/ml of protein. Sixty-one nasopharyngeal isolates were serotyped with our in-house latex agglutination <b>reagents,</b> with the results showing complete concordance with the Quellung reaction. Conclusions The method described here to produce latex agglutination <b>reagents</b> allows simple and efficient serotyping of pneumococci and may be applicable to latex agglutination <b>reagents</b> for typing or identification of other microorganisms. We recommend diluting antisera or removing centrifugation and wash steps for any latex <b>reagents</b> that fail QC. Our latex <b>reagents</b> are cost-effective, technically undemanding to prepare and remain stable for long periods of time, making them ideal for use in low-income countries. </p...|$|R
