40|$|The {{potential}} maximum <b>retention,</b> <b>S,</b> of the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method (SCS, 1956) {{was derived}} {{for a large}} set of published infiltration data ranging from Plainfield sand to Yololight clay using the relations between ?

The physical significance of S is explained using the diffusion term of the linearized Fokker-Planck equation for infiltration, which relates S to the storage and transmission properties of the soil. The derived S-values exhibit a strong looped relationship with the initial moisture content, analogous to that for curve numbers for three antecedent moisture conditions.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} a simple two stage rainfall-runoff model in which a curve number (CN) principle is used to calculate the soil water content and, subsequently, the rainfall contribution to direct runoff and groundwater flow. The maximum soil water <b>retention,</b> <b>S,</b> is used to express various characteristics of a catchment (infiltration rate, soil cover and land use, as in the CN method) relevant to flood formation. Using historical flood events, the model is calibrated, and the statistical distribution parameters of peak flows determined. With the same historical input data scenarios (rainfall), sets of flood hydrographs are simulated for various values of the parameter S, and corresponding distribution parameters of peak flows are determined. This procedure is used to demonstrate possible changes in flood regime to be expected due to changes of the catchment soil properties and its vegetation cover. A case study is presented fo...|$|E

The constant initial abstraction ratio is the most ambiguous assumption and requires considerable refinement. The objectives {{of this study were}} (1) to determine the initial abstraction ratio, in an experimental watershed in the Three Gorges Area of China, by analyzing measured rainfall-runoff events; (2) to compare the performance of the traditional and modified la/S values with observed rainfall-runoff data. The dataset consisted of 6 years of rainfall and runoff measurements from the experimental watershed. The results indicated that the la/S values, using event rainfall-runoff data, varied from 0. 010 to 0. 154, with a median of 0. 048. The average initial abstraction ratio of the watershed was equal to 0. 053. The standard SCS-CN method underestimates large runoff events, yielded a slope of the regression line of 0. 559 and an intercept of 0. 301. The modified la/S value was about 0. 05 that better predicted runoff depths with an R(2) of 0. 804 and a linear regression slope of 0. 834.

40|$|Background] Aroma {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} attributes defining wine quality in which yeasts play a crucial role, synthesizing aromatic compounds or releasing odourless conjugates. A present-day trend in winemaking consists of lowering fermentation temperature to achieve higher aroma production and <b>retention.</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids seem to have inherited beneficial traits from their parental species, like fermenting efficiently at low temperature or producing higher amounts of certain aromatic compounds. In this study, allelic composition and gene expression of the genes related to aroma synthesis in two genetically and phenotypically different S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids, Lalvin W 27 and VIN 7, were compared and related to aroma production in microvinifications at 12 and 28  °C. In addition, the contribution of the allele coming from each parental to the overall expression was explored by RT-PCR. [Results] The results indicated large differences in allele composition, gene expression and the contribution of each parental to the overall expression at the fermentation temperatures tested. Results obtained by RT-PCR showed that in ARO 1 and ATF 2 genes the S. kudriavzevii allele was more expressed than that of S. cerevisiae particularly at 12 °C. [Conclusions] This study revealed high differences regarding allele composition and gene expression in two S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids, which may have led to different aroma profiles in winemaking conditions. The contribution of the alleles coming from each parental to the overall expression has proved to differently influence aroma synthesis. Besides, the quantitative contribution to the overall gene expression of the alleles coming from one parental strain or the other was clearly determined by the fermentation temperature for some genes.

Interpretations of Landsat TM image indicated {{the presence of the}} following landform units: plateau, mountain, scarp, outwash plain, alluvial fans, plains and wadis. Soil profile descriptions and analytical data revealed that the soils are mostly deep, light or medium texture, massive, very low in organic matter (0. 3 - 7. 5 g Kg- 1), and highly calcareous (305. 8 - 797. 8 g Kg- 1 CaCO 3). Gypsum content was quite low, except for the outwash plain unit that contains from 0. 1 - 14. 5 g Kg- 1. Generally, the soils are nonsaline to slightly saline, except the soils of outwash plain and plateau (ECe ranges from 4. 02 - 59. 78 dS m- 1). Results showed marginal level for Fe, deficiency for Zn and Mn and sufficient or deficient for Cu. Soil profiles were classified into Entisols and Aridsols orders. The studied area was differentiated in view of type, number and degree of agricultural limitations. The main limitations are the effective root zone, depth to bedrock, amount of gravels, nutrient availability, relief, workability of land, available water, and calcium carbonate content. Therefore, soils of the studied area could be differentiated on the class level to the followings: moderately suitable (S 2 n,s 2), marginally suitable (S 3), and not suitable (N).

40|$|The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) {{method is}} widely used for {{predicting}} direct runoff from rainfall events. The ratio of initial abstraction (λ=Ia/S) to maximum potential <b>retention</b> (<b>S)</b> was assumed in its original development to be equal to 0. 2 (λ=Ia/S= 0. 2) in SCS-CN method. Application of the initial abstraction ratio equal to 0. 2 {{out of the area}} where it has been developed may lead to a non logical estimation of runoff. Thus, the study was conducted to determine the initial abstraction ratio (λ=Ia/S) by analyzing measured rainfall-runoff events. The dataset consisted of 58 rainfall-runoff events during 15 years (1987 - 2001) of rainfall and runoff measurements from Taham-Chay watershed, northwest of Zanjan, Iran. Based on the results, the estimated runoff value on the basis of Ia= 0. 2 S was 26. 7 times higher than the measured value, on average. There was a very low relationship between the measured and estimated runoff values (R 2 = 0. 09) and mean model error was 0. 13. The Ia/S values varied from 0. 004 to 0. 008 with an average of 0. 006. When Ia/S value was modified to 0. 08, ratio of the measured to estimate runoff value was 1. 4 and the determination coefficient (R 2) {{of the relationship between the}} two was 0. 41. When seven rainfall events that had the low rainfall intensity values (lower than 0. 14 mm/h) and two events that had the high rainfall depth (bigger than 10. 47 mm) during the past five days were removed from the data analysis process, ratio of the measured to estimated runoff value decreased to 1. 3 and the determination coefficient (R 2) of the relationship between the two enhanced to 0. 90.

40|$|Paddy {{fields are}} {{characterized}} by standing water and saturation condition during the entire crop growth period. However, in sub-humid and semi-arid areas, scarce rainfall and intermittent dry spells often cause soil moisture depletion resulting in unsaturated condition in the fields. These distinctive characteristics of the paddy fields have significant influence on the runoff generation and soil moisture retention characteristics of the watershed. In this study, {{the objective is to}} extend the application of the Soil Conservation Services Curve Number (SCS-CN) -based models for the geospatial and temporal simulation of soil moisture to paddy field-dominated agricultural watersheds in the water scarce areas. Different SCS-CN-based models, integrated with the soil moisture balance equation, are used to estimate the surface runoff and soil moisture content wherein, the spatial variation in the soil hydraulic characteristics is used to calculate the geospatial variation in soil moisture content. Physical significance of the terms initial abstraction (Ia) and potential maximum <b>retention</b> (<b>S)</b> in these models and their influence on the estimation of runoff and soil moisture are analysed in detail. A new SCS-CN-based model for soil moisture simulation (SCS-CN-SMS), to improve the soil moisture estimation, is proposed in this paper. The proposed model is built up on the soil moisture balance equation to account for the effect of ponding condition and soil moisture variation between the dry and saturation condition. The method is tested with 3 years observed surface runoff data and crop production statistics from a part of the Gandeshwari sub-watershed in West Bengal, India. The entire study area is divided into cells of 20 m × 20 m. Various components of the soil moisture balance equation are estimated for each cell {{as a function of the}} soil moisture content. Remote Sensing Technique and Geographic Information System (GIS) are used to extract and integrate the spatially distributed land use and soil characteristics. The Hortonion overland flow concept adopted in the SCS-CN method is used to estimate the soil hydraulic characteristics of each cell in which the curve number is used to infer the spatial variation of the land use and soil characteristics. Even though the original SCS-CN method and the existing modified versions are efficient for runoff estimation, these models are found to be inappropriate for the estimation of soil moisture distribution. On the other hand, the proposed SCS-CN-SMS model gives better results for both runoff and soil moisture simulation and is, therefore, more suitable for the hydrological modeling of paddy field-dominated agricultural watersheds. ...|$|E

Graduation thesis {{deals with}} a possible use of liquefied poplar wood for impregnation of solid poplar wood. Liquefied poplar wood was modified with formulations containing different concentrations of the melamine resin called Melapret NF 70 /M (MF). At first, the optimal curing temperature and time were determined. Then the cured mixture was tested for its surface hardness, elasticity and surface resistance to cold liquids. On {{the basis of these}} test results, we selected 2 representative mixtures: 1 st with a lower concentration of MF and 2 nd with a higher content of MF. These 2 mixtures were used for impregnation of poplar wood. We used the full cell treatment procedure also known as the Bethell schedule. After impregnation, the dimensions and weight of the samples were measured and the resin solution retention (MN) determined. The impregnated samples were then dried under similar conditions as the mixture before. After curing and drying the samples to their absolutely dry state, the dimensions and masses were measured again, and solid resin retention (SN) and weight percent gain (WPG) determined. To determine how well the mixture set and bonded into the cell walls we were soaking the samples in water to become completely wet. After the soaking process, anti swelling efficiency (ASE), water <b>retention</b> (<b>S)</b> and water repellency effectiveness (WRE) were measured. Afterwards the specimens were dried to their absolutely dry state. The percentage of leached-out mixture was determined by mass loss of the samples. Presuming that the only substance that leached out of the impregnated wood was the liquefied wood, we calculated the percentage of the leached liquefied wood. The results showed that the samples, impregnated with the lower concentration mixture, had higher mass losses after soaking than the samples, impregnated with the mixture of the higher concentration. ASE of the samples was the same for both mixtures and was just slightly lower than ASE of untreated samples. ASE of the treated samples, compared to the ASE of the untreated ones, showed that the mixture is not effective in water sorption prevention. Liquefied wood in combination with melamine resins is a fairly new material, and up to our best knowledge it has not yet been reported in the literature. Its use for saturation of wood did not prove well by our results. But the material has a large potential in research and development of new plastic and wood-based materials.

40|$|Hippo {{signaling}} is a tumor-suppressor pathway {{involved in}} organ size control and tumorigenesis through the inhibition of YAP and TAZ. Here, {{we show that}} energy stress induces YAP cytoplasmic <b>retention</b> and <b>S</b> 127 phosphorylation and inhibits YAP transcriptional activity and YAP-dependent transformation. These effects require the central metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the upstream Hippo pathway components Lats 1 /Lats 2 and angiomotin-like 1 (AMOTL 1). Furthermore, we show that AMPK directly phosphorylates S 793 of AMOTL 1. AMPK activation stabilizes and increases AMOTL 1 steady-state protein levels, contributing to YAP inhibition. The phosphorylation-deficient S 793 Ala mutant of AMOTL 1 showed a shorter half-life and conferred resistance to energy-stress-induced YAP inhibition. Our findings link energy sensing to the Hippo-YAP pathway and suggest that YAP may integrate spatial (contact inhibition), mechanical, and metabolic signals to control cellular proliferation and survival...|$|R
40|$|The lithium-sulfur (Li/S) {{concept has}} a {{theoretical}} specific capacity of 1672 [*]mAh[*]g− 1 {{based on the}} complete reduction of S into lithium sulfide (Li 2 S). Practically, however, a pure S electrode encounters low deliverable capacity and poor charge/discharge cycle life owing to S’s electrical insulation and problems associated with polysulfide dissolution. Here, we report our studies to couple S with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) prepared via either mechanical milling or chemical precipitation. The differences of the resulting rGO/S composites with respect to morphology, structure, composition, and phase transformations are extensively studied. Thermal analyses, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopic results on the chemical rGO/S consistently confirmed the existence of amorphous/nanocrystalline S and their homogeneous distribution as well as interaction with the rGO microstructure. The electrochemical performances of chemical rGO/S revealed a marked improvement in both capacity <b>retention</b> and <b>S</b> utilization compared {{to those of the}} mechanical rGO/S...|$|R
40|$|In endotherms insects, the thermoregulatory {{mechanisms}} modulate {{heat transfer}} from the thorax to the abdomen to avoid overheating or cooling {{in order to}} obtain a prolonged flight performance. Scarabaeus sacer and S. cicatricosus, two sympatric species with the same habitat and food preferences, showed daily temporal segregation with S. cicatricosus being more active during warmer hours of the day in opposition to S. sacer who avoid it. In the case of S. sacer, their endothermy pattern suggested an adaptive capacity for thorax heat <b>retention.</b> In <b>S.</b> cicatricosus, an active ???heat exchanger??? mechanism was suggested. However, no empirical evidence had been documented until now. Thermographic sequences recorded during flight performance showed evidence of the existence of both thermoregulatory mechanisms. In S. sacer, infrared sequences showed a possible heat insulator (passive thermal window), which prevents heat transfer from meso- and metathorax to the abdomen during flight. In S. cicatricosus, infrared sequences revealed clear and effective heat flow between the thorax and abdomen (abdominal heat transfer) that should be considered the main mechanism of thermoregulation. This was related to a subsequent increase in abdominal pumping (as a cooling mechanism) during flight. Computer microtomography scanning, anatomical dissections and internal air volume measurements showed two possible heat <b>retention</b> mechanisms for <b>S.</b> sacer; the abdominal air sacs and the development of the internal abdominal sternites that could explain the thermoregulation between thorax and abdomen. Our results suggest that interspecific interactions between sympatric species are regulated by very different mechanisms. These mechanisms create unique thermal niches for the different species, thereby preventing competition and modulating spatio-temporal distribution and the composition of dung beetle assemblages...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAcid-sensitive {{ecosystems}} {{are found in}} northern Saskatchewan, which lies downwind of major sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) emissions sources associated with the oil sands extraction industry. In order to protect these ecosystems against acidification, tolerance to acid deposition must be quantified. The suitability of the central empirical relationship used in the Steady-State Water Chemistry (SSWC) model to predict historical sulphate (SO 4) concentrations was investigated, and an alternate approach for determining aquatic critical loads of acidity (CL(A)) was employed for the study lakes (n =  260). Critical loads of acidity were often low, with median values of 12 – 16  mmolc m− 2  yr− 1, with the lower value reflecting a region-specific limit for acid-neutralizing capacity identified in this study. Uncertain levels of atmospheric deposition in the region, however, are problematic for characterizing acidification risk. Accurate S and chloride (Cl) deposition are needed to identify catchment sources (and sinks) of these elements in the new approach for CL(A) calculation. Likewise, accurate depiction of atmospheric deposition levels can prove useful for evaluation of lake runoff estimates on which estimates of CL(A) are contingent. While CL(A) are low and exceedance may occur according to projected increases in S deposition in the near-term, <b>S</b> <b>retention</b> {{appears to be an}} important feature in many catchments and risk of acidification may be overstated should long-term <b>S</b> <b>retention</b> be occurring in peatlands...|$|R
40|$|A dynamic hydrogeochemical {{model of}} water {{acidification}} (MAGIC: Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments) {{was applied to}} two catchments with contrasting hydrological influences in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region of Alberta to predict catchment response to elevated levels of acidic deposition. Key processes that determine catchment response to atmospheric deposition, including groundwater base cation inputs and <b>retention</b> of sulphur (<b>S)</b> in peatland complexes were parameterized in the model. Although deposition of S and nitrogen (N) in the region has increased over the last 40 years, levels are low at the study sites relative to impacted areas of eastern North America. Model forecasts for the period 2005 – 2100 were run under constant 2005 deposition levels (base case) and at acid deposition double this level. Simulated past and future soil base saturation was constant {{over the course of}} the 200 year (1900 – 2100) modelled period. At the lake with high charge balance acid neutralizing capacity (ANCCB), where large base cation sources dominate lake chemistry, little change in surface water chemistry was predicted under either forecast scenario. Under the double acid forecast scenario at the low ANCCB lake, simulated lake ANCCB decreased in response to elevated S deposition, but the magnitude of decrease was comparable to the range in observational data. The simulations suggest limited risk of acidification, primarily due to <b>S</b> <b>retention</b> in the catchments, but the potential for drought-induced episodic depression of ANCCB may be important on this landscape...|$|R
