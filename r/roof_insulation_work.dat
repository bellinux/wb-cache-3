40|$|Green roofs {{could act}} as a thermal buffer in {{buildings}} and offer potential energy savings. However, the energy benefits from green roofs are not usually properly recognised by traditional building energy regulations. Building energy regulations are traditionally over-simplistic during {{the assessment of the}} energy performance of complex building constructions. In the case of green roof designs, it is essential that the assessment mechanisms should not ignore the complex heat and moisture balances within the green roof layers. In this paper, dynamic energy modelling that considers the complexity within the green roof layers is adopted to guide policy makers in China on the relationship between using specific thicknesses of <b>roof</b> <b>insulation</b> against green <b>roof</b> layers. Simulations are run for a residential building type by also considering different thermal envelope characteristics across eight large Chinese cities and within the five main climatic zones of China. Results that link the green roof characteristics with respective traditional insulation layers are produced for all cities and it is found that optimising the plant and soil characteristics of green roofs in some climates could substitute more than 125 mm of <b>roof</b> <b>insulation,</b> while less optimum green roof types could only replace about 25 mm of <b>roof</b> <b>insulation...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{demonstrates the}} feasibility of a <b>roof</b> <b>insulation</b> method for prefabricated offices that uses vinyl packed timber chips to reduce air conditioning loads (hereinafter referred to as AC loads) and which also improves indoor thermal comfort. The advantages of the new <b>roof</b> <b>insulation</b> method were revealed through comparing the impacts of four roof types on prefabricated offices. The AC load and indoor thermal comfort (surface temperature and air temperature) were evaluated. The disposal of scrap timber discarded from building construction projects is costing money, and is also a waste of natural resources. The assessment of a new <b>roof</b> <b>insulation</b> method with timber chips demonstrates the advanced usage of timber chips, reducing the environmental load in the building construction process. On the other hand, since prefabricated offices have lower thermal storage capacities and are less airtight than RC (reinforced concrete) or S (steel) structured buildings, the AC load consumption and indoor thermal comfort exacerbation in prefabricated offices is more serious. Especially in summer, {{a large amount of}} solar energy absorption from the roof raises the indoor air temperature and significantly increases the cooling load.

The optimum thickness of insulation layers is determined {{for the quality}} objective of minimization of insulation material cost and energy consumption cost by air conditioning system over a life time of 10 years. For optimisation of <b>roof</b> <b>insulation</b> layer, the insulation layers are varied to five levels {{with reference to the}} height of concrete (HC) layer and various combination of roof layers are obtained from Taguchi’s L 25 orthogonal array.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} an economic model for calculating the optimum thermal resistance for <b>roof</b> <b>insulation.</b> It applies primarily to reroofing work, {{because it does}} not account for heating and cooling equip-ment cost savings attributable to increased insulation. The economic model uses current costs and heat content of fuels, heat-ing and cooling degree days, and the installed cost of <b>roof</b> <b>insulation</b> per unit of thermal resistance. It also shows the economic penalty for deviating from the calculated optimum insulation. Optimum thermal resistance is calculated for twenty representative cities in the United States, and is compared with ASHRAE Standard 90 - 75 for insulation in commercial and high rise residential buildings. Optimum thermal resistance calculated with natural gas as the fuel is lower than called for by the ASHRAE standard; the calculated optimum thermal resistance using electricity or oil is about the same as the ASHRAE standards. The scatter of the optimum thermal resistance calculated for each city shows that the thermal resistance should be calculated using local data rather than average values...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe use of PCMs for {{improving}} buildings’ thermal comfort conditions and reducing summer cooling need {{has been largely}} investigated in the last decade. The capability of these materials of storing heat in latent form has been pointed out, especially when integrated in building envelopes. This paper deals with {{the analysis of the}} benefits in terms of buildings’ energy saving generated by the integration of PCMs inside two types of membrane for roofing applications, i. e. a traditional bitumen membrane and an innovative cool polyurethane-based membrane. To this aim, the dynamic simulation of the energy performance of a test-room was carried out. Four configurations were simulated and compared: (i) roof covered by a bitumen sheet membrane, (ii) roof covered by a cool membrane, (iii) the cool membrane with integrated PCMs, and (iv) the bitumen membrane with integrated PCMs. Both winter and summer conditions were studied. The results showed that PCMs integrated into the cool membrane are able to guarantee a 10. 4 % cooling energy saving, while PCMs integrated into the bitumen membrane generate a 12. 6 % of energy reduction for cooling if compared to the only bitumen membrane. The same roof configurations without taking into account the <b>roof</b> <b>insulation</b> layer generate a reduction of the cooling energy requirement of about 9. 4 % and 16. 6 %, respectively. In winter conditions, the reduction of the heating demand generated by the integration of PCMs inside the bitumen membrane is about 4. 4 % and 6. 9 %, with and without considering the <b>roof</b> <b>insulation,</b> respectively. Additionally, the heating energy saving generated by including PCMs into the cool membrane is equal to 5. 4 % and 8. 4 %, with and without considering the <b>roof</b> <b>insulation</b> layer, respectively. These results demonstrated that the integration of PCMs in both cool and non-cool roof membranes is able to reduce building energy requirement in both summer and winter conditions, especially in non-insulated roof configuration...|$|R

The environmental impacts were allocated to single building elements. Ventilation, heat losses through roofs and external walls are important for a majority of single- and multi-family houses. Three improvement options were identified: additional <b>roof</b> <b>insulation,</b> additional façade insulation and new sealings to reduce ventilation.
