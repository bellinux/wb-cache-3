However, the US Navy closed the station in early 2013, hence any future licensed amateurs wishing to operate from the island will have to provide their own antenna and radio equipment.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, Paley {{served as}} {{director}} of <b>radio</b> <b>operations</b> of the Psychological Warfare branch in the Office of War Information at Allied Force Headquarters in London, where he held the rank of colonel.

Murrow, CBS's head of European news who expanded the news division's foreign coverage {{with a team of}} war correspondents later known as the Murrow Boys. In 1946, Paley promoted Frank Stanton to president of CBS. CBS expanded into TV and rode the post-World War II boom to surpass NBC, which had dominated radio.|$|E
25|$|The Duga {{systems were}} {{extremely}} powerful, over 10MW in some cases, and broadcast in the shortwave radio bands. They appeared without warning, {{sounding like a}} sharp, repetitive tapping noise at 10Hz, which led to it being nicknamed by shortwave listeners the Russian Woodpecker. The random frequency hops disrupted legitimate broadcasts, amateur <b>radio</b> <b>operations,</b> oceanic commercial aviation communications, utility transmissions, and resulted in thousands of complaints by many countries worldwide. The signal became such a nuisance that some receivers such as amateur radios and televisions actually began including 'Woodpecker Blankers' in their circuit designs {{in an effort to}} filter out the interference.|$|E
25|$|Limited amateur <b>radio</b> <b>operations</b> have occurred, using moon bounce or Earth–Moon–Earth communication, {{in which}} radio signals {{aimed at the}} Moon are {{reflected}} back to Earth. The first of these operations was on June 13–14, 1964, using the call KP4BPZ. A dozen or so two-way contacts were made on 144 and 432MHz. On July 3 and July 24, 1965, KP4BPZ was again activated on 432MHz, making approximately 30 contacts on 432MHz during the limited time slots available. For these tests, a very wide-band instrumentation recorder captured {{a large segment of}} the receiving bandwidth, enabling later verification of other amateur station callsigns. These were not two-way contacts. From April 16–18, 2010, again, the Arecibo Amateur Radio Club KP4AO conducted moon-bounce activity using the antenna.|$|E

25|$|The {{subjects}} taught in pilot training include: {{tactics of the}} branches of aviation, general aviation tactics, meteorology, air navigation, air traffic control, radio communications and culture in general, along with approximately 250 hours of flight. During the first year, the training is theoretical. During the second year, Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft are used for flight instruction. During the third the cadets are trained Aermacchi SF260EU for aerobatics, and later on Pilatus PC-7 for advanced flight tactics, including combat. Within each of these stages, the cadets are trained in aerial acrobatics, stage tactical instrument flight, visual flying rules (VFR), <b>radio</b> <b>operations,</b> among others, which increase in complexity as the cadets' training progresses. The first female aviator to graduate as a pilot {{in the history of}} FAM, Andrea Cruz, became a cadet at the Military Aviation School in 2007.|$|E
25|$|A high {{incidence}} of breast cancer in female staff working at the ABC's offices in Brisbane led to {{the closure of the}} site, based in Toowong, on 21 December 2006. Sixteen women were diagnosed with the disease in a period spanning 1994 to 2007. A progress report released in March 2007 by an independent panel formed to investigate the occurrences found that the rate of occurrence for breast cancer rate at the offices was eleven times higher than elsewhere – after the closure of the site, the ABC's Brisbane-based television and <b>radio</b> <b>operations</b> were moved to alternate locations around the city, including Ten Brisbane's studios at Mt Coot-tha. The ABC's managing director, Mark Scott, announced in August 2007 that new studios would be built on the site, following the final release of the Review and Scientific Investigation Panel's report. In January 2012 the ABC in Brisbane moved into purpose-built accommodation in South Bank.|$|E
500|$|The {{shortage}} of signals equipment {{was an important}} factor in the delay in committing the I Corps to the Syria–Lebanon campaign until it became clear that General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson could not adequately control operations from his headquarters at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. Once again, the signallers had to battle with inhospitable terrain. The hills and atmospheric conditions made reception difficult for the <b>radio</b> <b>operations,</b> and those same hills, along with shortages of cable, made the linesmen's task no less difficult. He was mentioned in dispatches, and made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for [...] "maintenance of communications under difficult conditions in the Grecian campaign".|$|E

500|$|He reached England in October 1941. He {{already had}} a broad network of {{contacts}} there, stemming both from his academic career {{as well as from}} his <b>radio</b> <b>operations.</b> He also maintained several contacts abroad, including scientists whom he knew from the Norwegian Institute of Technology: Harald Wergeland and Njål Hole. The opportunity to work directly for the British was presented to Tronstad, but instead he chose to aim his efforts towards disrupting the German occupation of Norway and improving the Norwegian resistance work. He even wanted to enrol in active duty, but was stopped by the Norwegian military command, who considered him [...] "too valuable" [...] for the war theatre. Tronstad's foremost skill was that of organization, which he owed to his experience in science. Thus, Tronstad became a part of the staff of the Ministry of Defence, and later of the Norwegian High Command. From 1943, he headed a section in department 4 (FO IV). This had been established in December 1942 under the leadership of Colonel Bjarne Øen, and Tronstad was brought in as a reinforcement as the work burden increased. Also, he had recently been promoted from Captain to Major. Tronstad's section was responsible for the special operation towards industry and shipping; training of the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (Kompani Linge); technical advice on sabotage, and {{towards the end of the}} war also the protection of Norwegian industry. He established the Norwegian High Command Technical Committee, which included other Norwegian scientists-in-exile such as Svein Rosseland, Helmer Dahl and Gunnar Randers. The Technical Committee is considered as the precursor to the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, established in 1946.|$|E
