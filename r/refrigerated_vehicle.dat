40|$|This paper {{describes}} an improved numerical simulation study of an isothermal chamber recently constructed at Zografou Campus of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) for {{the testing of}} special equipment used for transporting perishable foodstuffs {{in accordance with the}} United Nations ATP agreement. Using a transient finite difference model, a simulation is developed for a modern ATP test chamber and a typical specimen <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vehicle</b> to be tested. The simulation results are compared to experimental measurements taken under real conditions by a data acquisition system and a refrigerated semitrailer as specimen. Proportional-integral control is employed for the regulation of the cooling and heating system. The impact of various parameters on the time required to reach the set-point temperature (is,,) is investigated and the energy consumption is simulated for a period of 22 h. In particular, the impact of specimen insulation thickness and the thickness of the chamber insulation floor are considered in detail. The total energy consumption increases by approximately 16 % when the concrete floor layer thickness is increased from 8 to 16 cm for typical initial conditions and desired chamber and specimen temperatures of 32. 5 and 7. 5 degreesC, respectively. Using a floor insulation of 6 cm extruded heavy strain-resistant polystyrene reduces the energy consumption by at least 13 %. Specimen insulation thickness increase from U-value of 0. 35 Wm(- 2) K to 0. 75 W m(- 2) K result to an increase in energy consumption by a percentage of 28 %. Thermal capacity, temperature of car body and specimen dimensions are also treated as variables that affect the total duration of an ATP test and its total energy consumption.

40|$|AbstractA {{cold chain}} is a {{temperature}} controlled supply chain. The chain {{that brings the}} temperature-sensitive products from the factory to the consumer through an uninterrupted series of steps under a controlled temperature is usually called the “cold chain. ” The goods follow complex logistic paths along this chain, and the final distribution often {{requires the use of}} <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vehicles.</b> While the temperature is easily controlled and monitored in the factory plants, the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vehicles</b> can be a crucial point in the whole chain, since the products may undergo transient conditions during the loading operations or even during the whole transport process with great risk to the integrity of the goods. The <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vehicles</b> have to satisfy some thermal requirements, which are mainly related to the insulation and refrigeration capabilities, but this does not assure product integrity because of the unpredictable condition that may occur during the transportation and that could cause a significant change in the product temperature. The only reliable way of verifying the real integrity of the cold chain consists of monitoring the temperature of the products during their distribution. Application proposed in this paper deals with a wireless sensor network that has been specifically designed to monitor temperature-sensitive products during their distribution, with the aim of conforming to the cold-chain. Here sensors are placed along the cold boxes, such as product nodes communicate through a wireless channel with a base station which collects and processes the data sent by all nodes. This will continuously monitor temperature and multiple level of alert is provided in case of any undesirable condition in the product. The alert messages are forwarded to the vehicle driver and to the producer of the product...|$|R

40|$|Laboratory {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to examine the feasibility of inhibiting the ripening of bananas during long distance road transport by ventilating with ambient air {{as an alternative to}} the current practice of using <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Ventilation at 14 L/h per kg of fruit was found able to maintain ethylene at the desired concentration of 0. 01 mu L/L to prevent ripening during transit but the air needed to be humidified to >= 90 % RH to ensure weight loss remained well below the target loss of 4 %. Modelling against an actual vehicle route in Australia of about 2600 km from North Queensland to Sydney under climatic conditions prevailing over the four seasons showed that it was feasible to maintain ambient air at 90 % RH with an on-board water tank. It was concluded that transport of bananas with ventilation in a non-refrigerated vehicle could be a cost effective alternative to refrigeration.

40|$|In this paper, a new rich Vehicle Routing Problem {{that could}} arise {{in a real}} life context is {{introduced}} and formalized: the Multi Depot Multi Period Vehicle Routing Problem with a Heterogeneous Fleet. The goal {{of the problem is}} to minimize the total delivery cost. A heterogeneous fleet composed of vehicles with different capacity, characteristics (i. e. <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vehicles)</b> and hourly costs is considered. A limit on the maximum route duration is imposed. Unlike what happens in classical multi-depot VRP, not every customer may/will be served by all the vehicles or from all the depots. The planning horizon, as in most real life applications, consists of multiple periods, and the period in which each route is performed is a variable of the problem. The set of periods, within the time horizon, in which the delivery may be carried out is known for each customer. A Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation for MDMPVRPHF is presented in this paper, and an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) based Matheuristic approach is proposed, in which different destroy operators are defined.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an experimental and numerical design approach for a multi-layer insulation wall dedicated to <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vehicles</b> and containing a composite layer of PU-PCM foam. The thermal {{performances of the}} insulation walls and the thermal properties of the insulation materials are investigated using complementary experimental tools at different scales (a few mg to approximate to 100 g). In addition, a 1 D FEM model of heat and mass transfer within the wall is implemented. Two PU-PCM composites with high energy storage capkities (i. e. high PCM mass rate) are characterized at small and large scales. Although local inhomogeneity {{of the distribution of}} PCM microbeads within the composite material is highlighted, the complementary experiments allowed measuring the average PCM mass rates of the composite materials: 35 %w and 43 %w. Furthermore, the study of the multilayer insulation Wall shows the importance of the location of the composite layer inside it. Four multi layer wall geometries were tested to define the optimization trails. The energy crossing the inner face of the insulation wall during the "road delivery period" fell by as much as 18 % for the scenario, materials and geometries studied. It was observed that the composite material must be placed close to the external wall of the vehicle. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|By the 1890s {{refrigeration}} {{played a}} vital role in the distribution of food. The meat-packing industry relied heavily on natural ice in the 1880s and continued to rely on manufactured ice as those technologies became available. [...] By 1900, the meat-packing houses of Chicago had adopted ammonia-cycle commercial refrigeration. By 1914 almost every location used artificial refrigeration. The big meat packers, Armour, Swift, and Wilson, had purchased the most expensive units which they installed on train cars and in branch houses and storage facilities in the more remote distribution areas. [...] By the middle of the 20th century, refrigeration units were designed for installation on trucks or lorries. <b>Refrigerated</b> <b>vehicles</b> are used to transport perishable goods, such as frozen foods, fruit and vegetables, and temperature-sensitive chemicals. Most modern refrigerators keep the temperature between -40 and -20 °C, and have a maximum payload of around 24,000 kg gross weight (in Europe). [...] Although commercial refrigeration quickly progressed, it had limitations that prevented it from moving into the household. First, most refrigerators were far too large. Some of the commercial units being used in 1910 weighed between five and two hundred tons. Second, commercial refrigerators were expensive to produce, purchase, and maintain. Lastly, these refrigerators were unsafe. It was not uncommon for commercial refrigerators to catch fire, explode, or leak toxic gases. Refrigeration did not become a household technology until these three challenges were overcome.|$|R
