40|$|Two reaches on the <b>river</b> <b>Mura</b> are {{presented}} in the present work. First one lies downstream from the Town of Radenci and above the village of Krog. Second one is located betwen the villages of Srednja Bistrica, Hotiza and Gaberje. Changes in the river morphology due to river engineering measures are found. The first part is represented by three chapters. The concept of geomorphology is intoduced what includes comprehention, valuing and conservation of surface natural systems and forms. In third chapter the river geomorphology, river systems and proceses of riverbed shaping is discussed. In second part, the <b>Mura</b> <b>River</b> is introduced. Short acquaintance of river and its river basin in forth chapter is folloved by a detailed explanation of the <b>Mura</b> <b>River</b> in Slovenia. River system is defined with previously described parameters, and also comprehention of <b>river</b> <b>Mura</b> and present problematics is discussed. What follow is the fifth and main chapter where an analysis about the present condition {{of the river and}} the influences that the water interventions had is performed. A conclusion about just how close to the natural state the river is is made on the comparison of the present state with the former. ...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{its good}} {{strategic}} location, the castle controlled the narrow <b>Mura</b> <b>valley</b> north of Graz, which opens {{out into the}} Graz basin, and therefore the traffic and trade to and from Graz. The castle ruin, which is 200 m above Graz, is a popular place to visit, since it offers {{a panoramic view of}} the Graz basin and the eastern Styrian hill country even today.|$|R
50|$|Zala county shared borders {{with the}} Austrian land Styria and the Hungarian {{counties}} Vas, Veszprém, Somogy, Belovár-Körös and Varasd (the latter two in Croatia-Slavonia). The river Drava (Hungarian: Dráva) river formed its southern border, Lake Balaton its eastern border. The <b>rivers</b> <b>Mura</b> and Zala flowed through the county.

5000|$|Sveti Martin na Muri {{is located}} in a valley between the {{northern}} hills, near where the <b>river</b> <b>Mura</b> enters Croatia, and where peripanon area slowly turns to perialpine. This results in two distinct relief systems: lowlands {{in the northern part of}} the Municipality and hilly area in the south. The municipality is characterized by a moderate fresh continental climate.|$|R
50|$|In {{the upper}} <b>Mura</b> <b>valley</b> north of Turracher Höhe, the region around Predlitz (first {{documented}} mention in 1311) was sparsely populated because the slopes {{to the right}} of the Mura were less suitable for cultivation. During the Middle Ages, the dominant settlement of this region was Murau, which belonged to Liechtenstein. But south of Turracher Höhe, rural colonization around Reichenau, where there was also a regional court in 1520, provided more compact settlements and single farms.|$|R
5000|$|The {{highest point}} of the approx. two km long pass summit has an {{altitude}} of 1,795 m above sea level south of the Turracher Lake. The lake has a water level of 1,763 m above sea (Adria) level and {{is connected to the}} village. The Turracher Höhe, as a [...] "classic" [...] pass summit, is also part of a drainage divide between the <b>Mura</b> <b>valley</b> and the Upper Gurk River, whose source is beneath the Lattersteighöhe at approx. 2,000 m above sea level.|$|R

However, his former boss offers him a new job at the automechanic shop owned by his acquaintance Pišti Gajaš (Vlado Novak). Gajaš is an experienced, but somewhat naive local car mechanic who frequently talks about the past times when, in his opinion, the life was much better for the ordinary citizen. His friends frequently visit him to play cards and discuss the events happening around them.|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} Sveti Martin was until {{recently}} an economic appendix of Međimurje served {{to aid the}} protection of the natural environment, and the classification of the <b>river</b> <b>Mura</b> as protected landscape adds further momentum to the plans of the Municipality towards preservation of existing resources and more sustainable use. These characteristics are all favourable for the development of tourism, bathing tourism, especially eco-tourism, production of healthy food, fruit production, wine production, and management of areas alongside the river.|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{discussed}} {{the scope of}} developmental opportunities of the spatial placement of large infrastructures, {{not only for the}} state but also for local communities. It addressed the issue of placement and construction of hydropower plants on the <b>Mura</b> <b>River</b> in Austria and Slovenia {{in the light of the}} commitments taken by the Republic of Slovenia, regarding the increased use of renewable energy sources by 2020 and 2040. The thesis includes an analysis of developmental opportunities from the perspective of local communities, which have already constructed hydropower plants in Austria, and the first planned hydropower plant Hrastje Mota in Slovenia. We compare the development expectations of the local communities, spatial aspects of the regulatory, environmental aspects, and in particular the aspect of social acceptability in Austria and Slovenia. Shown are some examples of good practice development opportunities at already constructed hydropower plants on the <b>river</b> <b>Mura</b> in Austria. It was found that the placement of hydropower plant Hrastje Mota on the <b>river</b> <b>Mura</b> is possible with the appropriate technical adjustments and building the necessary measures for social acceptance. Social acceptability would be easier to achieve with the establishment of the »Moderator for natural and built environment« as an institution. Furthermore, the local community during the construction of hydropower plant Hrastje Mota see their development opportunities primarily in the construction of accompanying infrastructure arrangements and arrangements falling within the segment of new opportunities in tourism and improving the environment...|$|R
25|$|The Zrinski Bridge/Zrínyi Bridge {{connects the}} Croatian A4 and the Hungarian M7 motorways, {{spanning}} the <b>river</b> <b>Mura.</b> As it also spans Hungarian–Croatian border, a border checkpoint is situated {{adjacent to the}} bridge, on the north bank. The bridge is located between Goričan interchange of the A4 motorway and the M70 motorway interchange of the M7.

50|$|In 1918, {{after the}} {{collapse}} of the monarchic union of Austria-Hungary, and after the disarmament of the local police, the Međimurje region fell into civil disorder. The Croatian National Council sent hastily assembled troops, which crossed the <b>river</b> <b>Mura</b> and fought all the way to Dolni Lendava, where they met resistance. Troops commanded by Slavko Kvaternik finally forced the Hungarian troops to abandon Međimurje. On 9 January 1919, Međimurje officially seceded from Hungary, and it became part of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later known as Yugoslavia).|$|R
5000|$|The most {{northern}} part of the natural environment is the Protected landscape of the <b>River</b> <b>Mura.</b> Vegetation in the area's forests includes oak, hornbeam, alder, willow, poplar and acacia. Thanks to the diversity of habitats, fauna in the area is also rich. Mura and its tributaries, swamps and ponds contain many species of river fish, reptiles, and swamp birds, and the meadows and groves are home to low and high deer. There are about thirty species of fish registered in the waters of Mura, of which the most numerous is carp.|$|R
50|$|The {{whereabouts}} {{of his birth}} are unknown. He taught in a school in Rajka and later moved to the Mura March. In 1833 he translated a textbook from German into Hungarian and the local Prekmurje Slovene dialect. One of the topics of this book is the Mura March, which he calls Szlovenszka kraina in his native language because {{the inhabitants of the}} region called themselves szloveni (Slovenes). In the Hungarian version of the book, he calls them vandalus (Vandals) because Hungarian Slovenes living near the <b>rivers</b> <b>Mura</b> and Rába were thought to be descendants of the Vandals.|$|R

50|$|Slovenian ethnic {{territory}} {{was once}} more extensive than today, extending from Friuli in northeast Italy to Lake Balaton in Hungary. The Magyars settled {{the eastern part}} of this area in the early 10th century, and Prekmurje (along with Croatia and Slovakia) eventually became part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Thus Slovenes living east of the <b>Mura</b> <b>River</b> developed a separate identity from those west of the river under Austrian control as Prekmurje Slovenians. The Prekmurje Slovene language (Vend nyelv) became distinctive. In the 16th and 18th centuries, numerous Slovene families from the <b>Mura</b> and Raba <b>valleys</b> settled in Somogy County.|$|R

5000|$|The Sava Banovina is bounded on the north, {{as far as}} the <b>river</b> <b>Mura,</b> by the ... {{boundary}} of the Drava Banovina. Thereafter the {{boundary of}} this Banovina follows the <b>river</b> <b>Mura,</b> then the State frontier with Hungary to the point where this leaves the Drava; from this point the boundary of the Banovina follows the course of the Drava, then that of the Danube, {{as far as the}} northern boundary of the district of Ilok. From this point the boundary of the Banovina leaves the Danube and goes towards the Sava, following the eastern boundaries of the district, of Vukovar, Vinkovci, and Županja; taking in these districts. It then follows the course of the river Sava to the mouth of the river Una, then the course of the river Una as far as the north-eastern boundary of the district of Dvor (south-west of Kostajnica). From this point to the Adriatic (Morlach Channel) the boundary of the Banovina follows the southern boundaries of the districts of Kostajnica, Petrinja, Glina, and Gvozd, then the south-eastern boundary of the district of Vojnić and the eastern boundaries of the districts of Slunj, Korenica and Donji Lapac. The boundary then passes along the southern boundary of the districts of Gračac and Gospić, which it includes. From the Adriatic coast the boundary follows the gorge of Ljubač and the canal of Nova Povljana, passes between the islands of Maun and Planik, to rejoin, north of the islands of Olib and Silba, the State frontier on the Adriatic.|$|R
