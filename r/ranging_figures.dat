40|$|Abstract: Many {{screening}} hits inhibit enzymes {{with steep}} dose-response curves, which are considered pathological. Three models might explain these curves: multisite binding, an inhibitor phase transition, or stoichiometric inhibition {{caused by a}} high enzyme to Kd ratio. Experiments with promiscuous aggregators, for which steep curves are common, suggest that these curves owe to stoichiometric inhibition, which predicts that IC 50 should vary linearly with enzyme concentration. Most steep dose-response curves in screening {{may be due to}} this effect. High-throughput screening dominates early lead discovery and is intensely studied. 1, 2 Despite notable successes, the technique is plagued by artifactual hits. 3, 4 One common indica-tion of artifact among hits is a steep dose-response curve, often indicated by a high Hill coefficient. 5 For such compounds, inhibition rises much more quickly with concentration than one would expect. Thus, whereas a classical, single-site inhibitor increases from 10 % to 90 % inhibition over an 81 -fold concen-tration <b>range</b> (<b>Figure</b> 1, red curve), compounds with steep dose-response curves can do the same over less than a 10 -fold concentration <b>range</b> (<b>Figure</b> 1, black curve).
