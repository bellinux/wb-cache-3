25|$|When Peter finally {{shows up}} at work, he casually disregards office protocol, {{including}} violating Initech's dress code, taking Lumbergh's <b>reserved</b> <b>parking</b> spot, refusing to follow Lumbergh's directions, and removing a cubicle wall that blocks his view out the window. The consultants, however, are impressed by his frank insights into the office problems, and they decide to promote him. They also confide that Michael and Samir's jobs will be eliminated; Peter relays this news to them, and the trio decide to get even by infecting Initech's accounting system with a computer virus designed to divert fractions of pennies into a bank account. They believe that such transactions are small enough to avoid detection but {{will result in a}} substantial amount of money over time. Peter takes one last item on Michael and Samir's last day at Initech: a frequently malfunctioning printer, which the three take to a field and smash to pieces to vent their frustration.|$|E

500|$|With this information, however, {{several members}} of the group of conspirators watched Turner's office, home and car, and {{discussed}} methods to assassinate him, hoping that his death would hinder the efforts of the federal investigation into Rajneeshpuram. Their plan was to shoot Turner in the garage of the federal office building where he worked, in Portland, Oregon, but the conspirators also debated whether to murder Turner in downtown Portland or closer to his home. After spending multiple nights watching Turner's house, the conspirators decided on the parking garage because they felt it would be too risky to murder him on the drive to or from work, or in front of his home. Turner had a <b>reserved</b> <b>parking</b> spot in a federal garage underneath Terry Schrunk Plaza in Portland, Oregon. In an affidavit given to the FBI, conspirator Alma Peralta described how the perpetrators decided on the federal parking garage as the location: [...] "Shanti Bhadra [...] said this seems like a good place to bump this fellow off." ...|$|E

Most cities, including Hamburg and Munich, are not willing to allow electric cars in their bus lanes.|$|E
