Rutigliano, ever the <b>risk-taker,</b> decided to go for a touchdown.

The play he called was Red Right 88, a passing formation in which a slanting Logan would be Sipe's primary target, while Newsome was insurance. If everyone was covered, Rutigliano told Sipe on the sidelines, [...] "if you feel you have to force the ball, throw it into Lake Erie, throw it into some blonde's lap in the bleachers." [...] Sipe took the snap, dropped back and threw to Newsome as he crossed to the left. But Oakland safety Mike Davis leaped in front and intercepted the ball, cementing the Oakland win. The Raiders went on to win Super Bowl XV, while Red Right 88 became an enduring symbol of Cleveland's postseason stumbles.|$|E

40|$|If {{promotion}} in {{a hierarchy}} {{is based on}} a random signal of ability, rates of promotion will be affected by risk-taking. Further, the numbers and abilities of <b>risk-takers</b> and non-risk-takers will be different at each stage of the hierarchy, and the ratio will be changing. I show that, under mild conditions, more <b>risk-takers</b> than non-risk-takers will survive at early stages, but they will have lower ability. At later stages, this will be reversed: Fewer <b>risk-takers</b> than non-risk-takers survive, but they will have higher ability.

2500|$|The term [...] "entrepreneur" [...] {{is defined}} as an {{individual}} who organizes or operates a business or businesses.

However, the Irish-French economist Richard Cantillon defined the term first in his Essai sur la Nature du Commerce en Général, or Essay on the Nature of Trade in General, a book William Stanley Jevons considered the [...] "cradle of political economy". Cantillon used the term differently; biographer Anthony Breer noted that Cantillon saw the entrepreneur as a <b>risk-taker</b> while Say considered the entrepreneur a [...] "planner". Cantillon defined the term {{as a person who}} pays a certain price for a product and resells it at an uncertain price: [...] "making decisions about obtaining and using the resources while consequently admitting the risk of enterprise."

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effects of {{prenatal}} cocaine exposure and biological sex on adolescent risk-taking while controlling for early environmental risk. Methods: Adolescents (n. = 114, mean age. = 16) were grouped according to high and low risk-taking propensity as measured by the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Prenatal cocaine exposure was assessed at birth, while environmental risk was assessed at three points during early childhood. Results: A binary regression analysis indicated that males were 3. 5 times more likely than females to be high <b>risk-takers.</b> Biological sex and prenatal cocaine exposure interacted such that exposed males were most likely to be high <b>risk-takers</b> while exposed females were the least likely to be high <b>risk-takers.</b> This pattern held after controlling for prenatal alcohol exposure and early environmental risk. Early environmental risk did not predict adolescent risk-taking. Conclusions: These findings complement and extend earlier research demonstrating that prenatal cocaine exposure interacts with biological sex in domains related to inhibitory control, emotion regulation, antisocial behavior, and health risk behaviors during preadolescence. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
