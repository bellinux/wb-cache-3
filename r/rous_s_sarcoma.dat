40|$|Vasculogenesis is {{the process}} by which Endothelial Precursor Cells (EPCs) form a vasculature. This process has been {{traditionally}} regarded as an embryological process of vessel formation. However, as early as in the 602 ̆ 7 s the concept of postnatal vasculogenesis was introduced, with a strong resurface of this idea in recent years. Similarly, previous work on a mouse skin tumor model provided us with the grounds to consider the role of vasculogenesis during tumor formation. ^ We examined the contribution of donor bone marrow (BM) -derived cells to neovascularization in recipient nude mice with Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> is a primitive neuroectodermal tumor that most often affects children and young adults between 5 and 30 years of age. Despite multiple attempts to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy for the disease, the 2 -year metastases-free survival rate for patients with Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> has not improved over the past 15 years. New therapeutic approaches are therefore needed to reduce the mortality rate. ^ The contribution of BM endothelial precursor cells in the development of Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> was examined using different strategies to track the donor-derived cells. Using a BMT model that takes advantage of MHC differences between donor and recipient mice, we have found that donor BM cells were involved in the formation of Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> vasculature. ^ Cells responsible for this vasculogenesis activity may be located within the stem cell population of the murine BM. These stem cells would not only generate the hematopoietic lineage but they would also generate ECs. Bone marrow SP (Side Population) cells pertain to a subpopulation that can be identified using flow cytometric analysis of Hoechst 33342 -stained BM. This population of cells has HSC activity. We have tested the ability of BM SP cells to contribute to vasculogenesis in Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> using our MHC mismatched transplant model. Mice transplanted with SP cells developed tumor neovessels that were derived from the donor SP cells. Thus, SP cells not only replenished the hematopoietic system of the lethally irradiated mice, but also differentiated into a non-hematopoietic cell lineage and contributed to the formation of the tumor vasculature. ^ In summary, we have demonstrated that BM-derived cells are involved in the generation of the new vasculature during the growth of Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> The finding that vasculogenesis plays a role in Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> development opens the possibility of using genetically modified BM-derived cells for the treatment of Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} p 16 is {{a negative}} regulator of the cell cycle, and acts by preventing the phosphorylation of RB, which in turn prevents the progression from G 1 to S phase of the cell cycle. In addition to {{its role in the}} cell cycle, p 16 may also be able to induce apoptosis in some tumors. Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma,</b> a pediatric cancer of the bone and soft tissue, was used to study the ability of p 16 to induce apoptosis {{due to the fact that}} p 16 is often deleted in Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> tumors and may play a role in the oncogenesis or progression of this disease.

The much weaker mitogen-induced phosphorylation of EWS is catalysed by the MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) ERK 1 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1) and ERK 2, whereas the much stronger phosphorylation of EWS induced by the DNA alkylating agent MMS (methyl methanesulphonate) can be catalysed by JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) {{and at least one}} other protein kinase distinct from ERK 1 /ERK 2. In contrast, the phosphorylation of EWS-Fli 1 induced by MMS was largely mediated by p 38 alpha/p 38 beta MAPKs.

Radioactivity was determined by Geiger-Muller counter, and radioautography. Uptake of P^ by Yoshida 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> cells injected subcutaneously was much lower than that by the bones, nearly the same as that by the spleen and liver, and much higher than that by the blood, skin and brain.

40|$|Purpose: Recent {{evidence}} {{has supported the}} cancer stem cell theory that cancer contains a smallnumber of cancer stem cells (CSC) as a reservoir of cancer cells.

40|$|Ecteinascidin 743 (Et- 743), {{which is}} a novel DNA minor groove alkylator with a unique {{spectrum}} of antitumor activity, is currently being evaluated in phase II/III clinical trials. Although the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed antitumor activity are poorly understood, recent data suggests that post-translational modifications of RNA polymerase II Large Subunit (RNAPII LS) may {{play a central role}} in the cellular response to this promising anticancer agent. The stalling of an actively transcribing RNAPII LS at Et- 743 -DNA adducts is the initial cellular signal for transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). In this manner, Et- 743 poisons TC-NER and produces DNA single strand breaks. Et- 743 also inhibits the transcription and RNAPII LS-mediated expression of selected genes. Because the poisoning of TC-NER and transcription inhibition are critical components of the molecular response to Et- 743 treatment, we have investigated if changes in RNAPII LS contribute to the disruption of these two cellular pathways. In addition, we have studied changes in RNAPII LS in two tumors for which clinical responses were reported in phase I/II clinical trials: renal cell carcinoma and Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> Our results demonstrate that Et- 743 induces degradation of the RNAPII LS that is dependent on active transcription, a functional 26 S proteasome, and requires functional TC-NER, but not global genome repair. Additionally, we have provided the first experimental data indicating that degradation of RNAPII LS might lead to the inhibition of activated gene transcription. A set of studies performed in isogenic renal carcinoma cells deficient in von Hippel-Lindau protein, {{which is a}} ubiquitin-E 3 -ligase for RNAPII LS, confirmed the central role of RNAPII LS degradation in the sensitivity to Et- 743. Finally, we have shown that RNAPII LS is also degraded in Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> tumors following Et- 743 treatment and provide data to suggest that this event plays a role in decreased expression of the Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> oncoprotein, EWS-Fli 1. Altogether, these data implicate degradation of RNAPII LS as a critical event following Et- 743 exposure and suggest that the clinical activity observed in renal carcinoma and Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> may be mediated by disruption of molecular pathways requiring a fully functional RNAPII LS. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} observational studies {{performed at}} the main reference centre for paediatric HIV care and management in Mozambique, {{which is one of}} the countries most strongly affected by the AIDS pandemic. These studies focused on horizontal transmission, treatment outcomes and paediatric antiretroviral drug resistance in a cohort of HIV- 1 -infected children. The majority of children infected by HIV get the infection from their mothers during pregnancy, delivery or through breastfeeding, in what is known as mother-to-child transmission of HIV- 1. However, some of them, in a percentage that is not well ascertained in resource-constrained settings, can be infected through other modes. In the first paper, we explored different risk factors that might have contributed to HIV infection in a small cohort of HIV-infected children born to HIV non-infected mothers. A case control study strongly suggested health care as the possible source of infection for many of these children, with blood transfusion being significantly associated with HIV infection. Paediatric antiretroviral treatment (ART) has been available for children in Mozambique since December 2003. During the period between December 2003 and December 2008, more than 4700 children aged 0 - 18 years were recruited, and 1125 received ART in our centre. Survival frequency was 87 % after 60 months of antiretroviral treatment. The median follow-up time after ART initiation in the cohort was 24. 4 months (IQR 13. 5 - 35. 7). After 5 years of ART, 710 children (98. 1 %) were on first-line treatment, and 21 children (1. 9 %) were on second-line treatment. After 12 months on ART, there was an improvement in mean (SD) CD 4 % from 12. 3 (6. 3) to 27. 7 (8. 8) (p 24 months), with a per month increase of 1. 09 [1. 02 - 1. 16] (p= 0. 0065). Opportunistic infections are frequent in HIV- 1 -infected children, as are oncology-related infections. To date, there are no published reports investigating clinical outcomes of HIV- 1 -infected children with Kaposi <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> We described chemotherapy and ART outcomes in a cohort of 28 children with histological confirmed AIDS-associated Kaposi <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> (AKS). The cohort included twenty (71 %) males and 8 females who were moderately ill, severely immunosuppressed children. The mean patient age was 8. 3 (range 2 - 16) years, and the mean (SD) follow-up time was 27. 3 (14. 9) months. All patients were ART naive. Twenty-four children on ART were alive at 6 months after completing chemotherapy, corresponding to a survival rate of 85. 7 %. The CD 4 % increased from a mean (SD) of 16 % (9. 2) to 29. 2 % (27. 1) before initiation and after cessation of chemotherapy (p= 0. 02).

The objectives of the revision are a) to track more effectively the sever disabling morbidity associated with infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (including HIV- 1 and HIV- 2); b) to simplify reporting of AIDS cases; c) to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the definition through greater diagnostic application of laboratory evidence for HIV infection; and d) {{to be consistent with}} current diagnostic practice, which in some cases includes presumptive, i. e., without confirmatory laboratory evidence, diagnosis of AIDS-indicative diseases (e. g., Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Karposi 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma).</b> reported by Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists; AIDS Program, Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC.

40|$|Background: Warthin 2 ̆ 7 s tumor is {{a common}} benign {{neoplasm}} of the salivary gland. Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV- 8) is the etiologic agent for all forms of Kaposi 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> (KS), and HHV- 8 DNA is present in saliva, suggesting that non-sexual transmission is associated with latent infection of the salivary gland. Objectives: To provide insights into the HHV- 8 cell tropism, the presence of HHV- 8 was investigated {{in a series of}} Warthin 2 ̆ 7 s tumors of the salivary gland and corresponding adjacent normal tissue. Study design: Forty-three patients with Warthin 2 ̆ 7 s tumors (cystadenolymphoma) were tested for the presence of HHV- 8 DNA, and corresponding adjacent normal tissue samples were obtained from 15 patients. DNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissues. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was applied, and the positive samples were confirmed by direct sequencing. Results: HHV- 8 DNA was detected in 19 out of 43 (44...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{treatment}} of periacetabular malignant bone tumours is challenging. Many methods of reconstruction after internal hemipelvectomy {{have been reported}} and each method has its own limitations. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the oncological and functional outcomes of pasteurized autograft reconstruction after resection of periacetabular malignant bone tumours. Methods Ten patients (six male, four female) with periacetabular malignant tumours, who underwent resection and reconstruction with pasteurized autograft, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients 2 ̆ 019 average age at diagnosis was 400 years (range 132 ̆ 013650 years). There were five patients with chondrosarcoma, three with osteosarcoma, one with Ewing 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma,</b> and one with solitary metastatic thyroid carcinoma. Results At the last follow-up, seven patients were alive (six with no evidence of the primary disease and one with lung metastasis for 50 months). The three other patients died of metastasis of the primary disease with a mean survival time of 12 (range 82 ̆ 01317) months postoperatively. The mean follow-up time for all patients was 45 (range 82 ̆ 01387) months. Local recurrence rate was 10...|$|R
40|$|Background—Other than Kaposi 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma</b> (KS) -associated {{herpesvirus}} and CD 4 + T cell lymphopenia, {{the mechanisms}} responsible for KS {{in the context}} of HIV are poorly understood. One recently explored pathway of HIV pathogenesis involves induction of the enzyme indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase- 1 (IDO), which catabolizes tryptophan into kynurenine and several other immunologically active metabolites that suppress T cell proliferation. We investigated the role of IDO in the development of KS in HIV disease. Methods—In a case-control study among untreated HIV-infected Ugandans, cases were adults with KS and controls were without KS. IDO activity was assessed by the ratio of plasma kynurenine to tryptophan levels (KT ratio), measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results—We studied 631 HIV-infected subjects: 222 KS cases and 409 controls. Non-KS controls had a higher median plasma KT ratio (130, IQR: 90 to 190 nM/μM) than cases (110, IQR: 90 to 150 nM/μM) (p = 0. 004). After adjustment for age, sex, CD 4 count and plasma HIV RNA level, subjects with the highest (fourth quartile) plasma KT ratios had a 59...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 5958 The {{anti-cancer}} agent paclitaxel {{has been the}} subject of intense scientific evaluation since it was first isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew [T. brevifolia] in 1971. It is currently used extensively in the treatment of ovarian, breast and non-small cell lung cancers as well as AIDS-related Kaposi 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> The success of this agent is largely due to its novel mode of action ie. promotes the polymerisation of tubulin and stabilises the resultant microtubules to disassembly. Despite continuing efforts to develop a total synthetic route or an in vitro method of production which would ultimately be more reliable, more consistent and potentially inexhaustible paclitaxel is currently produced by semi-synthesis from 10 -deacetylbaccatin 111, a natural biosynthetic precursor isolated from the needles of the European yew. The problems associated with paclitaxel production include (1) the correct identification of the species in order to comply with the FDA licence and (2) the production of sufficient biomass to meet the world-wide demand for this drug...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionSolitary plasmocytoma {{is a rare}} plasmacytic cell tumor, {{which occurs}} {{in the head and}} neck region and rarely {{involves}} the mandible. Presentation of caseWe present a unique radiographic presentation of solitary bone plasmocytoma (SBP) occurring in the Jaw. A 63 -year-old male presented with the left mandibular swelling and on the conventional radiograph we noticed a lytic lesion with a sunray periosteal reaction. Clinical diagnosis was osteosarcoma but histopathology revealed sheets of plasma cells with cartwheel appearance and expansile bony trabecula suggestive for solitary bone plasmocytoma. 5 years after complentary treatment by local radiotherapy he developed malaise, weakness and generalized bone pain and bone marrow aspiration revealed more than 90 % plasma cell in the marrow and diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma was confirmed. DISCUSSIONSBP is radiographically seen as a well-defined radiolucent expansile lytic lesion with cortical thinning and no periosteal reaction. The imaging appearance of periosteal reaction is determined by the intensity, aggressiveness, and duration of the underlying pathology. Osteosarcoma, Metastasis (especially from sigmoid colon and rectum), Ewing <b>s</b> <b>sarcoma,</b> Haemangioma, meningioma and Tuberculosis are the main differential diagnosis of Sunburst periosteal reaction. ConclusionSunray periosteal reaction should be included in the differential diagnosis of lytic bone lesion in the mandible...|$|R
