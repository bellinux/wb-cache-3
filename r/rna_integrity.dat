50|$|As <b>RNA</b> <b>integrity</b> {{has long}} been known to be a problem in {{molecular}} biology studies, there are a few methods that have been used historically to determine the integrity of RNA. The most popular {{has long been}} agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining, allowing one to visualize the bands from the rRNA peaks. The height of the 28S and 18S bands can be compared to each other, with a 2:1 ratio indicating non-degraded RNA. While this method is very cheap and easy, there are several issues with this method, primarily its subjectivity, leading to inconsistent, non-standardized RNA quality assessments, and the large amounts of RNA that are needed to visualize it on an agarose gel, which can be problematic if there is not much RNA to work with. There are also a number of different problems that can arise from agarose gel electrophoresis, such as poor loading, uneven running, and uneven staining that lead to increased variability in the accuracy of using agarose gel electrophoresis to determine <b>RNA</b> <b>integrity.</b> Clearly, a standardized, repeatable, objective method of determining <b>RNA</b> <b>integrity</b> was needed.|$|E
40|$|AbstractProgressive loss of {{substantia nigra}} {{dopamine}} neurons (SN DA) is {{a hallmark of}} aging and of Parkinson's disease (PD). Mutations in PARK genes cause familial PD forms. Increased expression of alpha-synuclein (PARK 4) is a disease-triggering event in familial PD and also observed in SN DA neurons in sporadic PD but related transcriptional changes are unknown. With optimized single-cell quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, we compared messenger RNA and microRNA levels in SN DA neurons from sporadic PD patients and controls. Non-optimally matched donor ages and <b>RNA</b> <b>integrities</b> are common problems when analyzing human samples. We dissected the influence of distinct ages and <b>RNA</b> <b>integrities</b> of our samples by applying a specifically-optimized, linear-mixed-effects model to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-data. We identified that elevated alpha-synuclein messenger RNA levels in SN DA neurons of human PD brains were positively correlated with corresponding elevated levels of mRNAs for functional compensation of progressive SN DA loss and for enhanced proteasomal (PARK 5 /UCHL 1) and lysosomal (PARK 9 /ATPase 13 A 2) function, possibly counteracting alpha-synuclein toxicity. In contrast, microRNA miR- 133 b levels, previously implicated in transcriptional dysregulation in PD, were not altered in SN DA neurons in PD...|$|R

40|$|The {{presynaptic}} protein α-synuclein {{is involved}} in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). In rare familial forms of PD, causal mutations (PARK 1) as well as multiplications (PARK 4) of the α-synuclein gene have been identified. In sporadic, idiopathic PD, abnormal accumulation and deposition of α-synuclein might also cause degeneration of dopaminergic midbrain neurons, the clinically most relevant neuronal population in PD. Thus, cell-specific quantification of α-synuclein expression-levels in dopaminergic neurons from idiopathic PD patients in comparison to controls would provide essential information about contributions of α-synuclein to the etiology of PD. However, a number of previous studies addressing this question at the tissue-level yielded varying results regarding α-synuclein expression. To increase specificity, we developed a cell-specific approach for mRNA quantification that also took into account the important issue of variable <b>RNA</b> <b>integrities</b> of the individual human postmortem brain samples. We demonstrate that PCR –amplicon size can confound quantitative gene-expression analysis, in particular of partly degraded RNA. By combining optimized UV-laser microdissection- and quantitative RT–PCR-techniques with suitable PCR assays, we detected significantly elevated α-synuclein mRNA levels in individual, surviving neuromelanin- and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons from idiopathic PD brains compared to controls. These results strengthen the pathophysiologic role of transcriptional dysregulation of the α-synuclein gene in sporadic PD...|$|R

50|$|The {{integrity}} of RNA {{is a major}} concern for gene expression studies and traditionally has been evaluated using the 28S to 18S rRNA ratio, a method that {{has been shown to be}} inconsistent. This inconsistency arises because subjective, human interpretation is necessary to compare the 28S and 18S gel images. The RIN algorithm was devised to overcome this issue. The RIN algorithm is applied to electrophoretic RNA measurements, typically obtained using capillary gel electrophoresis, and based on a combination of different features that contribute information about the <b>RNA</b> <b>integrity</b> to provide a more universal measure.

In this study, the suitability of some potential substitutes of formalin for RNA-based applications has been considered. Conventional formalin was compared with methacarn and the commercial FineFIX. Their impact on overall RNA preservation was investigated in a cell line-based model fixed during a time course treatment and {{in a series of}} fixed human tissues. RNA yield was detected by Nanodrop; ribosomal <b>RNA</b> (rRNA) <b>integrity</b> by electrophoresis and the Agilent Bioanalyzer; messenger <b>RNA</b> (mRNA) <b>integrity</b> by Northern blot and endpoint reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; and mRNA amount by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In the cell line model, formalin fixation showed time-dependent detrimental effects on overall RNA preservation. Methacarn and FineFIX were more conservative on both rRNA and mRNA preservation and their impact was time-independent. In tissues, high rRNA degradation levels were found in all fixed specimens, contrasting with the results found in the cells. Conversely, the effects of the fixatives on mRNA integrity reflected the observations shown in the cell line model. In methacarn-fixed samples mRNA amount was also preserved, whereas in formalin and FineFIX-fixed samples it was notably lower when compared with the fresh frozen control. Alcohol-based fixatives are a good solution for long-term fixation of both cytologic and tissue samples by virtue of their time-independent effects on mRNA preservation. In fixed tissue samples, however, the potential effects of preanalytical tissue-related factors should be considered when performing mRNA quantitative analysis...|$|R

The isolated RNA is characterized by good quantity and quality and well suited for downstream applications like quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNA and microRNA.

MA. 22 accrued T 3 N 0, any N 2 or N 3, and T 4 breast cancer patients. Treatment was 6 cycles of 3 -weekly (Schedule A; N =  47) or 8 cycles of 2 -weekly (Schedule B; N =  46) epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy in sequential phase I/II studies, with growth factor support. In phase I of each schedule, MTDs were based on DLT. In phase II, clinical responses (CR/PR) and pathologic complete responses (pCR) were assessed. Tumor biopsy cores were obtained pre-, mid-, and post-treatment: 3 for pathologic assessment; 3 for microarray studies. DLT for Schedule A was febrile neutropenia at 105  mg/m 2 epirubicin and 75  mg/m 2 docetaxel; for schedule B, it was fatigue at 75  mg/m 2 for both agents. Phase II doses were 90  mg/m 2 epirubicin/ 75  mg/m 2 docetaxel for Schedule A and 60  mg/m 2 (both agents) for Schedule B. Schedule A CR/PR and pCR rates were 90 and 10  %, with large reductions in tumor <b>RNA</b> content and <b>integrity</b> following treatment; Schedule B results were 93 and 0  %, with smaller reductions in RNA quality. Pre-treatment expression of several genes was associated with clinical response, including those within a likely amplicon at 17 q 12 (ERBB 2, TCAP, GSDMB, and PNMT). The combination regimens had acceptable toxicity, good clinical response, induction of changes in tumor <b>RNA</b> content and <b>integrity.</b> Pre-treatment expression of particular genes was associated with clinical responses, including several near 17 q 12, which with ERBB 2, may better identify chemoresponsiveness.|$|R

In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of several antiviral treatments on hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles as model for enveloped viruses.

All different inactivation methods resulted in a loss of HCV infectivity by targeting different parts of the virus particle. Alcohols such as ethanol and 2 -propanol did not affect the viral <b>RNA</b> genome <b>integrity</b> but disrupted the viral envelope membrane in a capsid protection assay. Heat and UV treatment of HCV particles resulted in direct damage of the viral genome since transfection of viral particle-associated RNA into permissive cells did not initiate RNA replication. In addition, heat incubation at 80 °C disrupted the HCV envelope, rendering the viral capsid susceptible to proteolytic digest. This study demonstrated the molecular processes of viral inactivation of an enveloped virus and should facilitate the development of effective disinfection strategies in infection control not only against HCV but also against other enveloped viruses...|$|R

40|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) {{profiling}} in post-mortem human tissue {{might reveal}} information about gene expression {{at the time}} point of death or close to it.

The aims {{of the present study}} were to analyse the influence of impaired <b>RNA</b> <b>integrity</b> on the reliability of quantitative gene expression data and to identify ante- and post-mortem parameters that might lead to reduced RNA integrities in post-mortem human brain, cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle tissues. Furthermore, this study determined the impact of several parameters like type of tissue, age at death, gender and body mass index (BMI), as well as duration of agony, cause of death and post-mortem interval on the <b>RNA</b> <b>integrity.</b> The influence of <b>RNA</b> <b>integrity</b> on the reliability of quantitative gene expression data was analysed by generating degradation profiles for three gene transcripts. Based on the deduced cycle of quantification data, this study shows that reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) performance is affected by impaired <b>RNA</b> <b>integrity.</b> Depending on the transcript and tissue type, a shift in cycle threshold values of up to two cycles was observed. Determining <b>RNA</b> <b>integrity</b> number of 136 post-mortem samples revealed significantly different RNA qualities among the three tissue types with brain revealing significantly lower integrities compared to skeletal and cardiac muscle.

Correct data normalisation was found to partly diminish the effects caused by impaired RNA quality. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that in post-mortem tissue with low <b>RNA</b> <b>integrity</b> numbers, the detection of large differences in gene expression activities might still be possible, whereas small expression differences are prone to misinterpretation due to degradation.

For such low RIN samples a new approach has been developed by Illumina called the DV 200 metric, which is the percentage of fragments > 200 nucleotides. For samples with low RIN, DV 200 has proved to be a better method to predict if good quality data from RNA sequencing can be generated.

To characterise {{the performance of the}} ScreenTape ® platform for RNA analysis and determine the robustness of the SDV metric, a panel of intentionally degraded RNA samples was prepared. These samples were used to evaluate the ScreenTape ® platform against an alternative approach for measuring <b>RNA</b> <b>integrity</b> (Agilent Bioanalyzer RIN value). The samples were also subjected to microarray analysis and the resulting data correlated to the <b>RNA</b> <b>integrity</b> metrics. Findings Measurement of SDV for a panel of intentionally degraded RNA samples ranged from 0 for intact RNA to 37 for degraded RNA, with corresponding RIN values ranging from 10 to 4 for the same set of samples. SDV and RIN scales both demonstrated comparable discrimination between differently treated samples (RIN 10 to 7, SDV 0 to 15), with the SDV exhibiting better discrimination at higher degradation levels. Increasing SDV values correlated with a decrease in microarray sample labelling efficiency and an increase in numbers of differentially expressed genes.

Here we show that NRD {{can be divided into}} two mechanistically distinct pathways: one that eliminates rRNAs with deleterious mutations in the decoding site (18 S NRD) and one that eliminates rRNAs containing deleterious mutations in the peptidyl transferase center (25 S NRD). 18 S NRD is dependent on translation elongation and utilizes the same proteins as those participating in no-go mRNA decay (NGD). In cells that accumulate 18 S NRD and NGD decay intermediates, both RNA types can be seen in P-bodies. We propose that 18 S NRD and NGD are different observable outcomes of the same initiating event: a ribosome stalled inappropriately at a sense codon during translation elongation...|$|R

The analysis of genomics data of blood samples is demanding, due to various potentially confounding factors which need {{to be taken into account}} during the analytical procedure, including i) relative blood cell-type composition, ii) variation in cell-type gene expression signatures, iii) abundance of globin mRNA which interferes with microarray signal intensities, and iv) physiological condition of the individual [16],[40],[41], to name only some. The present project aimed to evaluate whether gene expression analysis of cells separated directly from whole blood by magnetic cell sorting (MACS Technology) was feasible. After evaluating the effects of several experimental conditions on RNA quality, and yield, followed by gene expression analysis of eight separated human blood cell populations, we concluded that MACSCell Separation can be combined with gene expression profiling and is well suited for processing of clinical trial samples. We found that EDTA-based anticoagulants perform much better than formaldehyde-based additives in terms of total <b>RNA</b> yield, <b>integrity,</b> and stability. The EDTA blood collection tubes for molecular assays gave the best results in terms of total RNA quality and quantity. In our hands, one of the formaldehyde-based tube-type, designed for stabilizing white blood cells for FACS analysis, gave suboptimal total RNA quality scores independent of the storage temperature and therefore we no longer evaluated those collection tubes for our purpose.|$|R
40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) {{certainly is}} a hot topic among the scientific community, judging by the broad financial investments and the tremendous research output to date. [1] This statement is further illustrated through a PubMed search on the term ‘RNA interference’ (performed on June 15 th 2009), which yielded ~ 16. 500 entries. RNAi is a naturally conserved gene silencing mechanism functioning in eukaryotic cells and is activated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that trigger the degradation of mRNA in a sequence‐specific manner. Besides its use as a laboratory tool in functional genomics and drug target discovery, the therapeutic potential of RNAi by blocking the production of disease‐causing proteins has also long been recognized. In conclusion, this thesis comprises a novel FRET based approach for the intracellular assessment of small interfering <b>RNA</b> (siRNA) <b>integrity,</b> which could aid in clarifying the correlation between intracellular siRNA fate and the eventual RNAi outcome. Besides siRNA stability, this thesis also describes the design of cationic and biodegradable nanogels for the time‐controlled delivery of siRNA. We provide evidence that these nanogels can effectively deliver active siRNA across the cellular barrier, leading to substantial and durable gene silencing. Endosomal escape is identified as the predominant barrier confining the full RNAi potential, opening up new opportunities to further improve this delivery concept. It is conceivable that, although RNAi can generally be applied {{to interfere with the}} expression of virtually any gene, several distinct in vivo delivery agents will be needed depending on the disease target and the chosen route of administration. Our nanogels may well claim a future position in this ensemble of siRNA delivery systems...|$|R
