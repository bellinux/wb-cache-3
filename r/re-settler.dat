40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines fiddling as {{a meeting}} place between Turtle Island's Indigenous nations and Manitoba's <b>re-settler</b> population. Based on archival research, interviews, and fieldwork in Manitoba, it argues that fiddling both reflects the broader relationship between Indigenous nations and re-settlers (which is marked by an unequal distribution of power) and is used to remake this relationship. The first section focuses on Indigenous fiddling. Using mainstream (<b>re-settler)</b> newspaper articles from {{the early twentieth century}} to the present day, it examines <b>re-settler</b> representations of Indigenous fiddlers and fiddling; it also explores Metisfest, a contemporary Metis rendezvous that functions as a space for Metis cultural resurgence, using fiddling as a central 'draw'. The next section considers the old-time scene by providing a working definition of the style, exploring fiddle contests, and addressing a number of key tensions in the old-time fiddle community. It argues that old-time fiddling functions as an unmarked centre that reinforces an unequal relationship between nations; at the same time, it acknowledges the significant contributions made by Indigenous fiddlers to Manitoba's old-time scene. The final section focuses on the Manitoba Open Old Time Fiddle Championships, a fiddle competition that explicitly brings old-time and Metis (style) fiddling together through the inclusion of a Metis-style category. This final section points to the tension between mainstream and Metis understandings of Metis fiddling and how Metis-style fiddling (at the competition) ultimately serves to affirm the dominance of an unmarked (i. e., old-time) style of fiddling. By exploring the Indigenous and old-time fiddle scenes from varied perspectives, this dissertation uncovers the complex relationships between central Turtle Island's two main fiddle styles. It also fills a significant lacuna in the research on Manitoba's fiddle scenes and recognizes that the burden to decolonize Turtle Island should not be placed (solely) on the shoulders of Indigenous nations...|$|E

50|$|The Russo-Turkish War (1768-1774) and the {{resulting}} Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca gave Russia the pretext under which they could begin their expansion into the Caucasus, marking {{the start of the}} century-long Caucasus War. In 1769-1770 almost half of the Volga Cossacks were re-settled around Mozdok. In 1776 further settlers arrived including more of the Volga Cossacks (the remaining Cossacks on the lower Volga were separated into the Astrakhan Cossacks Host) and the Khopyor Cossacks from the eastern Don territory. These formed the Azov-Mozdok defence line. Major foreposts for Russian expansion into the central Caucasus were founded by the <b>re-settlers</b> including: Giorgiyevsk in 1777 by the Khopyor regiment, and Vladikavkaz in 1784.|$|R

After the final demarcation of the government land, in 1840s on non-colonized by Greeks territory moved former Ukrainian Cossacks and state peasants (see state serf) from various counties of Poltava Governorate and Kharkov Governorate (Little Russia). After the partition of Poland, {{at the end of}} 18th century here were also exiled Polish people from the Kiev and Podolia governorates who also were under a special supervision by the local administration. Unlike the state peasants who used a community land, the exiled Poles were considered as a landowners ("odnodvortsy").|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to understand the existing formal and informal social networks among <b>re-settlers</b> in Ethiopia. Its main purpose is to explore the extent and gender implica¬tions of women’s participation in different social networks. The study aims to identify options for enhancing the role and sustainability of these social networks for promoting agricultural innovation in the Metema resettlement site in Ethiopia. Using multistage sampling procedure, the study {{is based on the}} selection of 2 out of 18 Peasant As¬sociations (PAs) in the district, and on a random sample of 160 households. The results show significant variations between previous and recent settlers, and between male and female headed households in terms of membership in different social networks. Relatives, friends and neighbors are the most important source of information and mutual support; and of influential networks in the adoption and diffusion process in the study area. The study recommends for government and NGOs to provide genuine support to social networks, to strengthen their organization, and to promote community based self help groups...|$|R
50|$|In 1956, {{however, the}} Soviet {{government}} issued a new decree on re-habilitation of the repressed peoples. Several thousand Chechens and Ingush took this chance {{to move back}} to their ancestral home. This was met with mixed signals, on one hand this allowed for a very potential workforce, on the other question arose of re-establishment of the ChIASSR and a full re-habilitation of the Chechens and Ingush people. The latter created several problems as most of their homes were now occupied by <b>re-settlers.</b> Nonetheless, in January 1957 the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR re-instated the ChIASSR and abolished Grozny Oblast. However, the pre-1944 borders were not preserved. Kizlyarsky District was passed to the Dagestan ASSR (which administered it during 1923-1937) and two left-bank Terek River districts (Naursky and Shelkovsky) adjacent to Chechnya were retained by the ChIASSR. This was done for two reasons, primarily due to the firm economic ties they developed to Grozny, but also to dilute the new republic's ethnic composition, as they became the central settlement zones for the returning Chechens (to avoid them being re-settled into the mountainous zones).|$|R
40|$|The Bili-bili Dam {{project in}} Sulawesi Island was {{completed}} in 1997. However, it was recently criticized in Japanese media, condemned that the project infiicted various problems on the resettled families. This opinion {{was based on the}} number of families who returned to their hometown at reservoir-adjacent area. The authors conducted a field survey in three resettlement villages to clarify the process of compensation and evaluate the resettlement scheme applied. Methods of survey were done in two ways. by Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) approach and In-depth interviews. The survey revealed that living conditions of two villages were significantly improved afier resettlement. In the other village, a series of legal disputes over land ownership restricted the expected income source even though the infrastructure condition is still fairly better than prior to resettlement. Most of <b>re-settlers</b> returned to their hometown (close to their original domiciles) in the reservoir-adjacent area of constructed Bilibili Dam regardless of the condition of the new destination area and mainly triggered by the attraction of better working opportunity in the better living condition in their hometown at reservoir-adjacent area during and after the dam construction...|$|R
5000|$|Nazi {{officials}} {{estimated that}} in February 1945 ten million refugees {{were on the}} move to escape the Russian advance. According to historians Hahn and Hahn humanitarian considerations did not {{play a role in}} Nazi evacuation planning, the Nazis considered the evacuation of the entire population as not feasible and that it was better that the population remain in territory occupied by the Soviets. By most current accounts drawing on research carried out in Poland, up {{until the end of the}} war 7,494,000 persons were evacuated from post-war Polish territory to the centre of Germany including 3,218,000 from Silesia, 2,053,000 from East Prussia, 1,081,000 from East Pomerania, 330,000 from East Brandenburg, and 812,000 from General Government. Among them, were 2,000,000 Germans who had been evacuated to, or had been resettled during the war into occupied Poland, and who took up homes of Poles subjected to ethnic cleansing operations in the preceding years. Before the end of war the number of Germans who evacuated from Czechoslovakia is estimated at 150,000 to 370,000; from Hungary 50,000-60,000; from Romania 100,000; from Yugoslavia 200,000-300,000 and from the USSR 324,000. According to sources, the total number ranged from 10 to 15 million persons. Many of those who were evacuated during the war returned to their homes in the east after May 1945; only to be transferred back to Germany in the following years. The West German Schieder commission estimated based on German ration card data from February/March 1944 that the total civilian German population (des deutschen Bevölkerungsstandes) east of the Oder-Neisse line was 11,924,000 at the end of 1944. Including 9,758,000 in pre-war German territory; 134,000 in Memel [...] 404,000 in Danzig and 1,602,000 on occupied Polish territory. According to Schieders calculations included in the total civilian population are 825,000 [...] persons evacuated eastwards to avoid Allied air raids and 1,174,000 Reichsdeutsche and <b>re-settlers</b> from other European nations. Schieder estimated that out of the 11.9 million population in late 1944 east of the Oder-Neisse line at the end of the war 4.4 million remained on Polish territory. More recent research in Poland puts the Germans in the fall of 1944 on the current Polish territory at 12,339,400 including 8,885,400 on pre-war German territory and Danzig; 670,000 in occupied Polish territory; 900,000 <b>re-settlers</b> from other European nations; 750,000 German occupation administrators and 1,134,000 persons evacuated eastwards to avoid Allied air raids [...] According to Rudiger Overmans the West German search service was able to confirm the deaths of 93,283 civilians due to the wartime flight and evacuations including 86,860 from the territory of present-day Poland and the Russian Kaliningrad region. According to the German Federal Archives 100,000 to 120,000 civilians were killed during the wartime flight and evacuation from the territory east of the Oder Neisse line.|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. The paper empirically {{illustrates}} the social capital {{status of the}} tsunami resettlements {{and its impact on}} donor dependency. After five years of Indian Ocean tsunami, study investigates the resettled fishing communities in eastern coast of Sri Lanka. Sample composed of 200 fishing families resettled in new locations but not in their original places. Cluster sampling technique was adopted to select the fishing families and interviewer administered; pre-tested questionnaires and focus group discussions were implemented to collect the data. Results revealed that fishing communities are multi ethnic and multi religious in nature and Tamils and Muslims were the dominant groups. Tsunami as well as new re-settlement schemes in new locations were destroyed the generations old community bonds. Conflicts were the common feature among <b>re-settlers</b> and existing villagers in new locations and social workers and administrators have to work hard to create new ties among them. Fishers were categorized into 3 groups (high, medium and low) based on their level of social capital. Resettlements having high level of social capital were less donor dependent compared to low levels of social capital. The main features of the high social capital re-settlements were family composition and occupation were similar to old establishment. Moreover, re-settlements with disturbed old village mechanism and fishers mixed with other occupancies showed low level of social capital and high donor dependency...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} 50 years, Kolkata has {{received}} massive waves of refugees, immigrants and <b>re-settlers,</b> often invading the porous space, and the neglected places {{of the existing}} neighborhoods, building and densifying railways, vacant lots, public gardens. This has undoubtedly contributed to the growing congestion and overcrowding, perhaps putting a strain on the urban middle class. This has produced the most extraordinary social mix ever seen in a city. Everyday Kolkata mixes managers and barbers, lawyers and shoe-cleaners, limousines and rickshaws. Hawkers and street kitchens are mostly seen {{as a source of}} nuisance, or worse. On the contrary, the benefits of proximity are largely exploited without mention: the abundance of services, the flexibility of the labour market. Instead, Kolkata’s policies seem to deny deliberately all value to proximity. This is particularly perceptible in the formal colonial city, the “vanishing city” that Chaudhuri correctly tries to defend; but it also refers to other central neighborhoods. For fifty years the city has been supporting, and sometimes forcing, the divorce of the middle and upper classes from traditional neighbourhoods: Salt Lake city, the Eastern bypass, Rayarhat are the following steps of a progressive estrangement from the city core. At the same time, the multiple manifestation of street life, its misery or excess, as well as its potential virtues, have been either repressed or ignored...|$|R
40|$|Information on {{technology}} adoption and diffusion {{in a given}} society is important for focusing future research, extension, government and NGO - led development efforts aiming at benefiting the majority of Ethiopian farmers. The identification of the roles of social networks that influence technology adoption and diffusion is important to identify and design measures to remove or alleviate the constraints affecting diffusion of innovation. This study was undertaken in Metema woreda of North Gondar Zone, Amhara National Regional State and {{has been designed to}} throw light on the existing formal and informal social networks among <b>re-settlers.</b> The extent of functional contributions of social networks and their gender implications in the diffusion of sorghum technology, and identification of options for enhancing the role and sustainability of these social networks for promoting agricultural innovation in the woreda was the focus of this study. Multistage sampling procedure was employed to select 2 PAs out of 18 PAs in the woreda and 160 sample households from these 2 PAs. Both qualitative and quantitative data were used to obtain reliable information from primary and secondary sources. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics, T-test and chi-square test. The this study variations were observed between previous and recent settlers as well as male and female headed households in terms of membership in different economically oriented groups and associations and participation in social networks. The binary logistic regression model out put showed that marital status, family size, number of close friends and membership in cooperatives were found to have positive and significant influence on the adoption of improved sorghum varieties. Likewise, education and years of residence in the village have negative and significant influences on the dependent variable. The study also revealed that, relatives, friends and neighbors were the most important nodes of information source, seed sources and mutual support; and influential networks in the adoption and diffusion process of the study area. To strengthen these influential social networks the organization and empowering of these networks and promoting into community based self help farmers groups with genuine support and supervision from governmental and non-governmental organization is imperative.

40|$|In their {{interactions}} with students who were immigrants or the descendants of immigrants, teachers at the Gesamtschule (comprehensive secondary school) in Osnabruck during the 1998 - 1999 school year took for granted that these students could not be German. The teachers assumed and expected that their Auslander (foreigners / non-citizens) and Aussiedler (German <b>re-settlers</b> from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union: literally, those who "settled out") students would be other than German, or ambiguously German. Nonetheless, the teachers expected them to be participatory German citizens {{and not to be}} other than supposedly liberal Germans. These contradictory assumptions and expectations existed concurrently and informed each other. This study of one people's views and constructions of others acknowledges the role played by both categorisations of others and group identification in processes of identity formation. In focussing on the teachers' social categorisations of their Auslander and Aussiedler students, I have contributed to knowledge of the role played by social categorisation of others in the nationhood and national identities of Germans in the late twentieth century. Enmeshed in an understanding of nationhood as indigeneity, the teachers sometimes stereotyped their Auslander and Aussiedler students as Turkish machos, Russian-speaking gang members or polarised them as liberal or fundamentalist. These categorisations were variously reinforced or challenged in the teachers' interpretations of {{their interactions}} with them. Reified stereotypes were evident and reinforced when the teachers' interpretations sought to represent others in terms that were familiar, and hence a great deal of potential cultural difference was avoided so as to render the foreign comprehensible. Stereotypes were unsettled when the teachers aimed to understand others on the others' own terms and allowed cultural difference to, challenge shared assumptions. While the teachers typically operated with an essentialist understanding of culture they frequently implied a processual understanding of culture. Despite my subjects' assumptions and expectations that their Auslander and Aussiedler students were other than German or ambiguously German they expected them to be active German citizens. This expectation and others - that they learn the German language, conform to civic and democratic values, and participate in German public life - constituted a form of liberalism, but a liberalism which was sometimes ethnicised. The teachers sometimes assumed liberalism to be essential to some ethnic groups and not to others. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examines new towns {{constructed for}} the Mahaweli Development Project (MDP) — a mega dam project — {{begun in the}} 1960 s, which involved a comprehensive resettlement programme that impacted approximately 1 million people, consisting of compulsory and voluntary <b>re-settlers,</b> and the traditional inhabitants. The key goal was sustainable agricultural reform, powered by hydro-electricity, to generate national economic stability. The initial 30 year MDP was accelerated to 6 years in 1977, and has attracted significant national and international interdisciplinary scholarship which tends {{to focus on the}} economic dimensions of the project. However, only a handful of studies examine the new towns designed by the Mahaweli Architectural Unit (MAU); a government initiative under the accelerated MDP, which designed and built 12 new towns between 1983 and 1989, from the perspective of architecture and urban design. The research analyses the design of these new towns in relation to the principles, policies and aspirations of the MDP, and, most significantly, socio-cultural assessment reports produced at the initial stages, which were comprehensive in their scope. These reports made specific recommendations about physical planning principles, and identified concerns about the full implications of population redistribution amidst established multi-ethnic settlements in the Dry- Zone. These same reports underpinned the revised brief presented to the MAU. To evaluate the new towns in the light of these recommendations, this paper draws on archival material at the Mahaweli Archives in Colombo and recent field work in four new Mahaweli towns (Girandurukotte, Dehiattakandiya, Digana and Karalliyadda). The research is also informed by the reflective retrospective writings of the key architects of the MAU and an interview with one of them. The research argues that the MAU embraced the MDP initiative to build sustainable new towns with a certain degree of success. The MAU, which engaged local and foreign architects, instigated a new paradigm of urban design practice in Sri Lanka. However, while the vernacular language employed sought to serve the community and promote urban growth at a rural scale, notable failures {{can be attributed to the}} apparent disregard for the detailed assessments and planning recommendations provided to the MAU, despite the rigor of the sociological reports and the architects’ argument for a people-centred design approach. With the advantage of hindsight, this research reflects on the lessons that can be learned, in retrospect, from this ambitious initiative which sought to create sustainable new towns in Sri Lanka in a period of profound political, economic and environmental change. Given the recent trend of the mega dam related resettlement programmes; increasing concern for resettled peoples and renewed emphasis on addressing sociological and environmental impacts, and the escalating number of large scale infrastructure projects in developing countries, and crises ranging from climate change to ethnic conflict — the global reality today — which force displacement, resettlement and redistribution of people, the findings of this research inform understanding of planning, design and implementation in future initiatives. This modest research renews emphasis on the importance of sociological concerns as a key dimension of sustainable development. Thesis (M. Phil.)

40|$|After {{incorporating}} the Ussuri region into Russia, the latter’s primary {{aim was to}} colonize {{the coast of the}} Sea of Japan to make it not only nominal but also a real property of Russia. In order to find <b>re-settlers</b> for this region, Russian officials started search in the western corner of their empire – on Estonian islands Saaremaa and Muhumaa, where people already worked as fishermen and were also interested in getting some land. They were an exact match to the Russians’ needs for populating the other end of their empire, the land beside the Pacific. In {{the second half of the}} 19 th century the grounds for regular ship connection between Odessa and Vladivostok were laid. In 1898 Estonian scouts went to the Ussuri region to see the land they were offered (at the expense of Russia). The scouts were satisfied – the sea was filled with fish and the territory was surrounded with forests. Every individual settler was granted 15 hectares of land, each family – 100 hectares, and they were freed from taxes for five years; besides, they were supplied with food for 18 months and allocated some money for buying tools. Estonian settlers could also count on getting 1000 roubles for fishing equipment and setup. However, the land was not totally uninhabited. The Chinese lived there seasonally – they cultivated the land and lived in their shacks, but they had no legal right to the land. As an unpleasant surprise, they found out that the land they had been using was now in the possession of Estonians. Estonians were surprised as well when they realized that the land allocated to them was already partly cultivated and in use; yet, they gained advantage from the situation. As rightful owners, they rented part of their lands to the Chinese. The conditions for land cultivation and fishing in the Pacific were different from those in Estonia. It took time before people adapted to local climate, landscape, soil and fishing opportunities. Two villages were settled by Estonians: Liiviküla (founded in 1899) and Linda (founded in 1903). By the year 1915 there were 141 households with 691 people (236 men and 455 women). 80 of them were fisherman. Then the revolution and the First World War broke out, and contact with the homeland was lost. In 1922 the Red Army reached Vladivostok. This started a new phase in the life of Estonians of the Far East. In 1924 the associations of fishermen were established, and in 1929 a kolkhoz named “Liflandets” was founded on the basis of these associations. In 1931, when Juhan Hanslepp was elected the chairman of the kolkhoz, it was renamed to Novõi Mir (New World). Since the Estonians were hard-working and well organized, the fishing kolkhoz was quite soon one of the most productive collective farms in the region. In the beginning, the Estonian kolkhoz was the only one that was engaged not only in fishing but also shipbuilding. In 1937 – 38 the villages were subjected to Stalinist repressions. The Second World War sent all the men to the front and women had to take care of the village life. They caught fish, cultivated land and raised children. After the war the community separated – some left for their original homeland and the others stayed in their new homeland – the Far East. The fishing kolkhoz started to fish out on the ocean. Their work made them a millionaire-kolkhoz, which developed friendly relations with another one of the kind – Kirov (in Estonia). They acted like state within a state – the kolkhoz owned a school, a preschool, a fishing fleet, and fish processing factories. First the captains of the fleet were Estonians, later on Russians. By now the Estonian community has assimilated. The only reminders of the Estonian settlement are some place- and family names. The assimilation has taken place very rapidly – within one generation. It is partly because of the Stalinist repressive politics towards national minorities, partly because of the distance from the motherland and lack of Estonian cultural life, but mostly because of the conscious choice of the younger generation to lead an easier life. It is true that the generation regrets that they do not know the language of their forefathers, but they blame their parents for not motivating them enough to learn it. Today the Estonian community consists of nearly ten elderly people, who are able to communicate in Estonian, are still interested in their ethnic homeland, and have not fallen victim to the Russian propaganda. The Estonian settlement stood on the coast of the Pacific Ocean for one hundred years. Today there are only eight people in Liiviküla village who can understand Estonian...|$|R
