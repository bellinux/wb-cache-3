25|$|Formation Skydiving (FS) {{was born}} in California, USA during the 1960‘s. The first {{documented}} skydiving formation occurred over Arvin, California in March 1964 when Mitch Poteet, Don Henderson, Andy Keech and Lou Paproski successfully formed a 4-man star formation, photographed by Bob Buquor. This discipline was formerly {{referred to in the}} skydiving community as <b>Relative</b> <b>Work,</b> often abbreviated to RW, Relly or Rel.|$|E
2500|$|A Canopy <b>Relative</b> <b>Work,</b> or CREW jump for short, is a skydive {{where the}} {{participants}} open their parachutes very quickly {{after leaving the}} aircraft {{with the intention of}} flying in close proximity to each other. The goal is to create various formations by [...] "docking" [...] with other parachutists on the jump. The dock is often accomplished by placing ones feet into the lines of another person's parachute. Formations require at least 2 people, but can have many more.|$|E

60|$|Bunyan {{possessed a}} soul with faculties capable {{of the highest}} {{enjoyment}} of the communion of saints in church order. His ideas of mutual forbearance--that 'in lowliness of mind should each esteem others better than themselves'--he enforces with very peculiar power, and, at the same time, with delicate sensibility. After the pilgrims had been washed by Innocence in the Interpreter's bath, he sealed them, which 'greatly added to their beauty,' and then arrayed them in white raiment of fine linen; and 'when the women were thus adorned, {{they seemed to be}} a terror one to the other, for that they could not see that glory each one on herself which they could see in each other. Now, therefore, they began to esteem each other better than themselves.'[127] 'The Interpreter led them into his garden, where was great variety of flowers. Then said he, Behold, the flowers are diverse in stature, in quality and colour, and smell and virtue, and some are better than some; also, where the gardener hath set them, there they stand, and quarrel not with one another.'[128] 'When Christians stand every one in their places, and do their <b>relative</b> <b>work,</b> then they are like the flowers in the garden that grow where the gardener hath planted them, and both honour the gardener and the garden in which they are planted.'[129] In the same treatise on Christian Behaviour, similar sentiments are expressed in language extremely striking and beautiful. 'The doctrine of the gospel is like the dew and the small rain that distilleth upon the tender grass, wherewith it doth flourish and is kept green (Deut 32:2).Christians are like the several flowers in a garden that have upon each of them the dew of heaven, which, being shaken with the wind, they let fall their dew at each other's roots, whereby they are jointly nourished, and become nourishers of one another. For Christians to commune savourly of God's matters one with another, it is as if they opened to each other's nostrils boxes of perfume.'[130] Similar peaceful, heavenly principles, flow through Bunyan's Discourse of the Building, &c., of the House of God and its inmates;[131] and blessed would it be if in all our churches every believer was baptized into such motives of forbearance and brotherly love. These sentiments do honour to the head and heart of the prince of allegorists, and should be presented in letters of gold to every candidate for church fellowship. A young man entertaining such opinions as these, however rude his former conduct, being born again to spiritual enjoyments, would become a treasure to the Christian society with which he might be connected.|$|E

40|$|Semisupervised Discriminant Analysis (SDA) is a semisupervised {{dimensionality}} reduction algorithm, {{which can}} easily resolve the out-of-sample problem. <b>Relative</b> <b>works</b> usually {{focus on the}} geometric relationships of data points, which are not obvious, to enhance the performance of SDA. Different from these <b>relative</b> <b>works,</b> the regularized graph construction is researched here, which {{is important in the}} graph-based semisupervised learning methods. In this paper, we propose a novel graph for Semisupervised Discriminant Analysis, which is called combined low-rank and k-nearest neighbor (LRKNN) graph. In our LRKNN graph, we map the data to the LR feature space and then the kNN is adopted to satisfy the algorithmic requirements of SDA. Since the low-rank representation can capture the global structure and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm can maximally preserve the local geometrical structure of the data, the LRKNN graph can significantly improve the performance of SDA. Extensive experiments on several real-world databases show that the proposed LRKNN graph is an efficient graph constructor, which can largely outperform other commonly used baselines...|$|R

The Matrix2 is a competition specific Canopy <b>Relative</b> <b>Work</b> canopy. The GLX was developed for a non-skydiving discipline called Speedflying or bladerunning, which involves flying a parachute down a slope close to the ground. All these parachutes are currently available from NZ Aerosports Ltd.|$|E
50|$|Tracking is {{regarded}} as an essential life saving skill for all freefall skydivers engaging in <b>relative</b> <b>work</b> with others, allowing the jumpers to gain horizontal separation after building a formation and before opening their parachutes. Accordingly, the greater the number of skydivers on a jump, the better their tracking skills must be. In addition to having to track a longer distance after break-off (tracking away for separation before opening), {{they also have to}} be more aware of other jumpers around them and {{have to be able to}} track in a straight line away from the center of the formation.|$|E

50|$|Roger and {{his older}} brother, Carl Nelson, {{grew up in the}} small town of Lisle, Illinois. They began their skydiving careers in 1971 as novice parachutists at a drop-zone {{surrounded}} by cornfields in Hinckley, Illinois. At the time, <b>relative</b> <b>work</b> (RW) or formation skydiving was in its infancy. Carl and Roger Nelson, unlike most skydivers at the time, were not ex-military and had the '70s hippie look, with long hair and grubby clothes. They became known as the Freak Brothers. The name stuck. A form of flying that they later popularized (anything that was not belly to earth) became known as freak-flying—eventually morphing into freeflying.|$|E
50|$|The Arc Trainer is {{adjustable}} for incline {{and resistance}} {{and has a}} variable stride rate. Resistance settings are proportional to body-weight such that {{the same amount of}} <b>relative</b> <b>work</b> is performed by a 110 lb female and a 250 lb male when the same resistance level is selected. There are two versions of the Arc Trainer, a lower body version and a total body version. The Total Body Arc Trainer uses a same side forward pattern of motion where the arm and leg on the same side move together. This movement pattern allows the user to transfer work to their upper body without simultaneously increasing the work rate of the legs.|$|E

50|$|Both the Junior and Senior {{competition}} {{teams are}} composed of approximately ten members: two four-way teams, and one two-member team performing vertical <b>relative</b> <b>work,</b> also known as freefly. All 20 members compete in canopy accuracy as well. In the aerial events, teams are given 35 to 40 seconds to complete a preplanned formation maneuvers after exiting the plane. Jumpers exit with a videographer who records the jump for judging. The competition team represents the Wings of Blue at numerous competitions across the country, to include the National Skydiving Championships, National Collegiate Parachuting Championships, Black and Gold Competition (an all military competition), and numerous other free fall and accuracy meets throughout the year. The comp team fares well in all these meets, winning medals at many of the meets they attend.
