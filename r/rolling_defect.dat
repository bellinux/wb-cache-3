By analyzing the characteristics of thermal plasticity of 40 Cr steel, the Hensel-Spittel flow stress model of 40 Cr steel was established in this study. For the possible continuous rolling schedule of Φ 80 mm 40 Cr steel from 200 mm× 200 mm billet, the advanced technology of viscoplastic FEM by LARSTRAN/SHAPE was used to create 3 -D thermo-mechanical coupled simulation models for 8 -pass hot continuous rolling processes. From the rolling process simulation the stress, strain, temperature distribution and rolling force variation were obtained. The simulation results included the comparison of plastic deformation of round pass with curved side wall and round pass with straight-side wall as well as the cause of <b>rolling</b> <b>defect</b> (e. g. crack).

To {{deal with}} the {{demodulation}} problem of <b>rolling</b> bearing <b>defect</b> vibration signal in heavy noise, a new method based on time-delayed correlation algorithm and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is presented. Introduced the time-delayed autocorrelation de-noising principle. After the discretization and unbiased estimation of the original signal’s autocorrelation function, de-noising pretreatment is implemented by appending a rectangle window. Then an envelope signal {{can be obtained by}} the first Hilbert transform. After the EEMD decomposition, some interested intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) can be collected. By making the second Hilbert transform of the IMFs, we can get the local Hilbert marginal spectrum from which the <b>defects</b> in a <b>rolling</b> bearing can be identified. By repeated analysis of simulation signals and actual <b>rolling</b> bearing’s <b>defect</b> vibration signal, the results show that the proposed method is more effective than direct modulation or only time-delayed correlation demodulation or combine time-delayed correlation with EMD demodulation in de-noising and diagnosing the <b>rolling</b> bearing's <b>defect</b> information...|$|R

Minor {{and random}} slip between rolling {{elements}} and races in rolling element bearings makes vibration signals have periodically time-varying ensemble statistics, {{which is known}} as cyclostationarity. Two second-order cyclostationary methods, the spectral correlation density (SCD) {{and the degree of}} cyclostationarity (DCS), are talked about in this paper based on a statistical model of rolling element bearings. The SCD provides redundant information in bi-frequency plane and cyclic frequency domain embodies the majority of it, which is a series of non-zero discrete cyclic frequencies completely reflecting the fault characters of rolling element bearings. The DCS has virtues of less computation and clearer representation, at the same time keeps the same characters with SCD in cyclic frequency domain. And the DCS is also proved to be resistant to the additive and multiplicative stationary noise.

As a consequence, {{de-scaling}} and pickling operations must be performed prior or after hot <b>rolling.</b> Many surface <b>defects</b> caused by hot rolling {{are related to}} oxidation in the reheating furnace. One {{of these is the}} melting of eutectic FeO/Fe 2 SiO 4 during reheating over 1170 degrees C giving as a result red scale defects in Si-added steel. On the other hand, steel strip surface oxidation during hot rolling causes an industrial and environmental problem: secondary oxide is removed after roughing, but tertiary oxide scales already start to form before entering the finishing stands. Their properties affect the final steel surface quality and its response to further processing. Furthermore, the addition of alloying elements has an important impact on scale properties.

However, systematic research tools and experimental strategies for addressing these issues have not yet been developed. In addition, the mechanisms of oxide cracking and failure have not been understood. In this thesis, research tools and strategies are proposed for studying the high temperature oxidation of low carbon steels. These tools allow the presentation of new data on the phase composition of iron oxides at elevated temperature, characteristics of iron oxide formation, oxide microstructure and texture, oxide defects, and stress distributions in different oxide layers, as well as residual stresses. The microscopic model that was proposed for description of oxide failure allows better understanding of the mechanism for surface defect formation during hot rolling. To describe the dynamics of phase composition changes in textured oxides at elevated temperature, a new phase analysis method is proposed. This x-ray diffraction phase analysis is based on the Rietveld and Dickson's methods, and is used for investigating the effect of alloying elements on the oxidation process. This method was also adopted to track in-situ phase composition changes during high temperature oxidation of commercial low carbon steels. The structure of oxides on low carbon steels, pure iron, and Si-steels was systematically examined by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM). It is demonstrated that OIM can be an invaluable tool for visualizing the oxide microstructure texture and studies of oxide defects. In order to simulate industrial hot rolling of oxidized steel sheet, high temperature oxidations tests were made in the tube furnace up to 950 °C, in air. The oxidation process and microstructure development were described using OIM maps including image quality (IQ) and inverse pole figure (IPF) maps. The three different iron oxides phases could be distinguished and the characteristics of oxides with different oxidation histories were compared. Iron oxides developed during high temperature oxidation consisted of wustite (FeO), magnetite (Fe 304), and hematite (Fe 20 s) structures with varying texture, grain shape and size. In order to understand the mechanical properties of iron oxides, residual stresses in the three iron oxides phases were assessed using a specially designed x-ray stress measurement system. The stress distributions in the oxide layers were also simulated using finite element simulation of the hot rolling process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a novel damage detection technique, tailored at {{the identification of}} structural surface damage on rail structures. The damage detection, proposed in this paper, exploits the wave propagation phenomena (P, S, Rayleigh and guided wave velocities) by identifying discrepancies, due to damage presence, in the dynamic behaviour of the structure. The uncorrelations are generated by waves reflected back to the sensor locations by the flaw surfaces. The peculiarity of the presented approach {{is the use of}} a time frequency coherence function for the identification of the arrivals of guided wave reflected back to the sensors by the damage surfaces. The damage detection methodology developed was divided into three steps. In the first step, the presence of the damage on the structure was assessed. In the second step, the arrival time of the reflected wave (or echo) was estimated using the continuous wavelet transform. Then, the detection algorithm was able, through a ray-tracing algorithm, to estimate the location of damage. A numerical investigation of two single damages was carried out. The damage was introduced on the railhead surface to simulate <b>rolling</b> contact fatigue <b>defects.</b> The results showed that the proposed methodology can be used successfully to localise the damage location, however, as expected, the localisation is strongly affected by the frequency range used. The results suggested that the separation and the characterisation of single modes are crucial for the identification of different types of rail defects. Further work is needed to establish the damage severity by relating the magnitude of the changes of the time frequency coherence to reflection and attenuation coefficients of each guided wave used and on the selection of the best range of frequency according to the type of damage to be identified...|$|R

It. series of tests were then performed that loaded a crack in pure shear, or a mixture of tension and shear, looking at the effects of using fully reversed shear loading, and the effects of applying tensile mean stresses to reduce the friction on the crack flanks. However these tests all produced less than one millimetre of mode II growth, before the cracks arrested or branched. The final series of tests however applied a tensile load cycle before each shear load cycle. This time coplanar growth was produced, that is the crack grew {{in the direction of the}} maximum shear stress. This type of load cycle is a simplification of the load cycle calculated by Bower and Johnson of Cambridge University, where the tensile load is produced by fluid trapped in the crack. Two crack growth rate formulae were produced that fitted the data, indicating that the growth rate was dependent on both the tensile and the shear parts of the cycle...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the detection of surface-breaking defects, such as stress corrosion cracking, using an ultrasonic scanning approach in which a laser source and detector are scanned over the near-field of a defect. Large increases in the amplitude and frequency content of an incident ultrasonic wave are present when either the source or the detector is very close to the defect, leading to a phenomenon known as ultrasonic near-field enhancement. The extent of the ultrasonic enhancement varies with defect characteristics such as defect depth and angle to the surface. Ultrasonic enhancement is observed in both experiment and finite element simulations using Rayleigh waves for both scanning laser detection and scanning laser source methods. The near-field enhancement is shown to vary {{as a function of the}} angle of the defect to the horizontal for Rayleigh wave enhancements, allowing the positioning and characterisation of artificial angled defects that are similar to <b>rolling</b> contact fatigue <b>defects</b> in railtrack. The mechanisms behind the near-field enhancement of Rayleigh waves at angled defects are identified, and this aids in the understanding of the behaviour of ultrasound as it interacts with surface-breaking defects. Ultrasonic enhancements are also reported to be present in individual Lamb wave modes for interactions with artificial open-mouthed defects in thin plates, which are similar to the open end of stress corrosion defects. The mechanisms behind both the scanning laser detection and scanning laser source enhancements are identified and used to explain the variation in the enhancement as a function of increasing defect severity. Positioning of these defects is also achieved by identification of the enhancement location. Finally, the scanning laser technique is applied to real stress-driven defects, and both scanning approaches are shown to be capable of detecting partially-closed defects in a variety of sample geometries. The position, geometric alignment and an estimate of the defect depth are obtained for real defects in thin plates, pipework sections and in irregularly shaped engine components...|$|R
40|$|In {{rails and}} wheels {{subjected}} to severe rolling/sliding contact, large plastic deformations accumulate {{in the surface}} layer. This decreases the fatigue resistance of components and makes this layer prone to formation of common <b>rolling</b> contact related <b>defects.</b> In pearlitic steel railway components, accumulated plastic deformations result in microstructural changes which, in turn, lead to anisotropic characteristic of properties like fracture toughness. The aim of the thesis is to investigate the influence of material anisotropy on damage mechanisms of pearlitic rail steels subjected to rolling/sliding contact. The interaction between the pearlitic microstructure and cracks in the surface layer of rail samples is studied. Based on microstructural investigations, an anisotropic fracture surface model is proposed {{to account for the}} directional dependence of resistance against crack propagation. The fracture surface model is employed in a computational framework where propagation of planar cracks is simulated. The simulation results show that the degree of anisotropy in the surface layer has a significant influence on the crack propagation path. In particular isotropic material characteristics will result in crack propagation towards the surface. This is a fairly benign type of fracture as compared to the transversal rail breaks that may result if the propagation deviates into the bulk material. To include large plastic deformations and the resulting anisotropy in simulations, a hybrid micro-macromechanical material model for pearlitic steels is proposed. Results from High Pressure Torsion (HPT) tests were used to calibrate the model. In HPT tests, samples are deformed under similar loading conditions to that of the rail-wheel contact i. e. a high compressive force and simultaneous large torsional straining. The HPT deformation procedure is simulated in the commercial finite element package ABAQUS. Numerical results agree well with experimental data demonstrating the high potential of the proposed material model in analyses including large deformations of pearlitic steel. In addition, the influence of different homogenization techniques in the material model is investigated. Two models proposed for a pearlitic colony are calibrated against micro-compression test data. The macroscopic response of a 3 D model of pearlitic steel during simple shear deformation is compared with the response predicted by the developed hybrid material model. The hybrid model was found to give stress-strain responses that are qualitatively similar, but around 12 % lower in stress magnitudes compared to the other two models. This should be contrasted towards the superior computational performance of the hybrid model...|$|R
