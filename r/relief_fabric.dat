50|$|Locke uses a {{wide range}} of media, {{including}} painting, drawing, photography, <b>relief,</b> <b>fabric,</b> sculpture and casting, and makes extensive use of found objects and collage. He has demonstrated an especial interest in working around sites and ideas with a historical resonance. He has cited architecture ranging from the Baroque, Rajput, Islamic, and Caribbean vernacular to Victorian Funfairs as influences. Recurrent themes and imagery include visual expressions of power, trophies, globalisation, movement of peoples, the creation of cultures, ships and boats, and packaging.|$|E
40|$|This {{series of}} thermo-moulded relief layered fabrics {{was created for}} Yves Saint Laurent’s 2009 – 10 Winter Collection. The thermo-moulding process was adapted from {{technology}} used by the automotive industry for vehicle interiors. Developments included extending the range of fabrics and fabric combinations (including flannel and silk), exploring the possibilities of using other materials (particularly leathers) and increasing {{the size of the}} thermo-moulding equipment in order to produce sufficient material to make large garments. Wanting more than the limited range of aesthetic qualities required by vehicle manufacturers, Avella exploited the process to create new lightweight ‘sandwiched’ thermo-bonded composite fabrics with a permanent relief-textured surface. These technologies had never previously been applied in a fashion context. The intensive six-month research process started with the production of test pieces of <b>relief</b> <b>fabric</b> using thermo-moulding vacuum formers. This {{led to the development of}} completely new, larger pattern formers. The conclusion was the creation of runs of fabrics large enough to support the commercial production of garments and accessories for the Winter Collection. Development was iterative, responding to the potential of earlier test pieces and, during the later stages, following liaison with garment designers and pattern cutters. The resulting composite fabrics allowed for the creation of pieces that were lightweight while being capable of maintaining a strongly structured form. The fabrics were a key element of the designs shown in Yves Saint Laurent’s 2009 – 10 Winter Collection during Paris Fashion Week and featured heavily in the associated advertising campaign. International press editorials specifically referenced the materials created by Avella, for example: ‘The show opened with black leather, some of it textured with thermo-molding technology borrowed from the car industry…the material was mainly used to construct sleek, though not too close-fitting, pieces’ (Sarah Mower, style. com, 2009 : [URL]...|$|E
40|$|As {{consumers}} exigence {{and competition}} grows the industrial companies requires more reliable, accurate and versatile surface inspection systems to be developed. Fabrics thickness measurements where usually made {{by means of}} contact probes that deformed the samples leading to the necessity of complicated correction procedures. We have developed an optical system of non contact microtopography based on a simple principle of triangulation, devoted to measure thickness and <b>relief</b> mapping of <b>fabrics...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{investigation}} of {{influence of the}} relief surface structure of textile materials on protective and comfort properties of multilayer system used for firefighters clothing was performed. For the research different types of multilayer systems consisting of outer shell, thermal and moisture barrier layers and lining were formed. After testing of fabrics mechanical and physical characteristics {{it was revealed that}} the structure of a separate fabric layer had a direct influence on protective and comfort properties of a multilayer system of firefighter’s garment. In order to decrease a total weight of the protective garment, multilayer systems formed of lower area density <b>fabrics</b> having <b>relief</b> surface were compared to the systems having flat relief. The results showed that systems composed of <b>relief</b> structure <b>fabrics</b> ensured the required level of protection creating additional air gaps, also low weight of the systems improved wearing comfort properties.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the issues of}} violence, spectatorial invasion and psychic affect in the large-scale wall-mounted metal and <b>fabric</b> <b>reliefs</b> made by female sculptor Lee Bontecou in New York between 1959 and 1967. It is argued that Bontecou's work both engages with and destabilizes the sculptural encounter as it was reconfigured at that time. In tracking the shift from the phenomenological reading of how subjects encounter objects in space that {{was so important to}} minimalism, this article discusses the movement towards a psychically charged encounter that is less stable and which draws instead upon psychoanalytic readings of blindness, desire and aggression. If, during the 1960 s, sculptural practice can be crudely schematized in terms of the move from specificity of objecthood to the subsequent dematerialization of the object, Bontecou's works articulate the consequences for the viewing encounter and attendant anxieties that such a shift demands...|$|R
40|$|Double-layered {{fabric is}} {{composed}} of two warp and two weft systems which are interconnected {{to each other in}} a specific manner. Specific weaving machine construction, new chemical and mechanical finishing options enabled us to develop, produce and install specific <b>relief</b> double-layered spatial <b>fabrics</b> that reflect the latest trends in textiles. Made fabrics combines classic traditional Lithuanian textile patterns and ornamentation features recommended and actual in the trend of recent year with new suggested spatial double-layered fabric structure. The investigation covers the fabric quality forecasting. Double-layered spatial fabrics’ mechanical properties {{are one of the most}} important characteristics that determine the value of consumer products; the fabric longevity, durability depends on product strength, elasticity. Double- layered fabric wear is evaluated by fabric’s abrasion resistance. Textile finishing really changes the appearance and properties of fabrics – the fabric becomes softer, fluffier, more recovers after finishing. Grey double-layered fabrics can be used for home, decorative textiles due to its smooth and rigid surface and fabrics after finishing can be used for clothing manufacturing industry due to its softness and friability. Set mathematical relationships let to forecast indicators on which the production of high-quality spatial double-layered fabrics was developed and implemented...|$|R
40|$|Mapping Nebraska is a drawn, {{stitched}} and digitally imaged cartography of {{the state}} (physical, social, cultural, sociological) where I live. The interrelated components of this on-going project are: A 15 foot wide hand-drawn “Locator Map” of Nebraska, with every city, town, park, railroad, river, lake and creek drawn to scale on 95 Tyvek sections which were then stitched together. Terrain Squares, quilted and embroidered <b>fabric</b> <b>relief</b> forms of the physical topography of selected locations, using software {{to be able to}} see the terrain at a much larger scale (1 inch = 596 feet) than the Locator Map. Surveys, or on-the-ground documentation (with a still camera and a dash-mounted Flip video camera) of each of the 95 sections. I’ve covered 5, 000 miles to date, traveling on state highways and gravel roads. Ground Cloths, mixed media textile constructions which respond to a particular location and which document what is unseen, invisible, remembered or imagined. In this public talk at the International Quilt Study Center and Museum (presented in conjunction with the exhibition SAQA Showcase: Studio Art Quilts Invitational) I give a visual overview of Mapping Nebraska. I approach stitching, like mapping, as a fundamental way of converting personal knowledge to transmittable knowledge and I share some of what I’ve learned as I stitch (draw and travel) across Nebraska.
