25|$|Israel was {{the first}} non-European country to be {{associated}} to the European Union's Framework Programme for Research and Technical Development (RTD). Israel's special status {{is the result of}} its high level of scientific and <b>research</b> <b>capability</b> and the dense network of long-standing relations in scientific and technical co-operation between Israel and the EU. The European Commission signed an agreement with Israel in July 2004 allowing for its participation in the EU's Galileo project for a global navigation satellite system. As of 2014, Israel {{was a member of the}} European science organization, CERN, becoming the only non-European member.|$|E
500|$|Oliphant was an {{advocate}} of nuclear weapons research. He served on the post-war Technical Committee that advised the British government on nuclear weapons, and publicly declared that Britain needed to develop its own nuclear weapons independent of the United States to [...] "avoid the danger of becoming a lesser power". The establishment of a world-class nuclear physics <b>research</b> <b>capability</b> in Australia was intimately linked with the government's plans to develop nuclear power and weapons. Locating the new research institute in Canberra would place it close to the Snowy Mountains Scheme, which was planned to be the centrepiece of a new nuclear power industry. Oliphant hoped that Britain would assist with the Australian program, and the British were interested in cooperation because Australia had uranium ore and weapons testing sites, and there were concerns that Australia was becoming too closely aligned with the United States. Arrangements were made for Australian scientists to be seconded to the British Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, but the close cooperation he sought was stymied by security concerns arising from Britain's commitments to the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2001, the Lincoln Legal Papers {{research}} project distributed {{copies of the}} legal papers of Abraham Lincoln to every accredited law school in every state; this deprived Alaska {{of access to the}} papers. In February 2003 Havelock proposed Anchorage as a permanent home for the World Economic Forum, since the city was known as the [...] "Air Crossroads of the World." [...] Noting that Alaska is the only state without a law school, he [...] proposed a law school with [...] "an international flair" [...] to strengthen the <b>research</b> <b>capability</b> of an Anchorage-based forum and felt that the combination of a World Economic Forum home and an international law school would attract related non-governmental organizations to settle in Anchorage. In May 2003, Alaskan attorney and real-estate broker Kirk Wickersham registered the name [...] "Alaska Law School, Inc." [...] with the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development. In June of that year, Wickersham delivered a speech [...] entitled [...] "Development of a Law School in Alaska" [...] to the monthly Harvard and Yale Clubs of Alaska meeting in Anchorage. Later that month, the Supreme Court of the United States noted the absence of a public, American Bar Association (ABA)-accredited law school in Alaska in Grutter v. Bollinger. In April 2004, the Maryland Daily Record noted that continuing legal education was not mandatory for Alaska attorneys. In April 2007, Alaskan attorney and University of Alaska Anchorage instructor Terry C. Aglietti registered the name [...] "Alaska School of Law, Limited" [...] with the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development.|$|E
