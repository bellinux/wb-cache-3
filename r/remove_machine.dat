Thereafter, slides are vertically dipped in 1 % NMA gel up to two-third of the frosted area (the frosted end prevents the gel from slipping off the slide). Wipe the underside of slide to remove agarose and lay the slide in a tray or {{on a flat surface}} to dry. The slides may be air dried or warmed at 50  °C for quicker drying. The slides are stored in a dry slide box at room temperature until needed, and are generally prepared the day before use. (NOTE: Slides should be labeled at the frosted end with pencil before storage to avoid confusion of the side with/without gel) (Bajpayee et al. 2005; Shukla et al. 2014).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In the {{industrial}} environment a short down-time of {{computer numerical control}} (CNC) machine tools is increasingly important. One approach to counter the loss of production {{is to make the}} machines more reliable, thereby reducing their times of non-use. Another is to enable machine operators to locate and to <b>remove</b> <b>machine</b> faults and their causes themselves, in order to reduce delay until maintenance staV is sent from a location far away. Operators may be supported in the fault-®nding process by a knowledge-based decision-support system. The questions as to how to avoid the negative consequences of using such systems and how to even increase competence on the job is addressed by ComPASS, a system based on a multi-agent architecture. A running, functioning prototype was developed and evaluated. Based on this experience the system is currently being extended and improved, ®rst results of which are presented here...|$|E

The depth of the removal is controlled by the handle. The power is transmitted from engine to the primary shaft. The primary shaft is connected to secondary shaft. The cam shape of shaft is to transmit the power to the blade by using chain drive.

40|$|Abstract — As high {{performance}} computing systems contin-ually become faster, the operating cost to run these systems has increased. A {{significant portion of}} the operating costs {{can be attributed to the}} amount of energy required for these systems to operate. To reduce these costs it is important for system administrators to operate these systems in an energy-efficient manner. To help facilitate a transition to energy-efficient computing, the trade-offs between system perfor-mance and system energy consumption must be analyzed and understood. We analyze these trade-offs through bi-objective resource allocation techniques, and in this paper we explore an analysis approach to help system administrators inves-tigate these trade-offs. Additionally, we show how system administrators can perform “what-if ” analyses to evaluate the effects of adding or <b>removing</b> <b>machines</b> from their {{high performance}} computing systems. We perform our study using three environments based on data collected from real machines and real applications. We show that by utilizing different resource allocations we are able to significantly change the performance and energy consumption of a given system, providing a system administrator with the means to examine these trade-offs to help make intelligent decisions regarding the scheduling and composition of their systems...|$|R
