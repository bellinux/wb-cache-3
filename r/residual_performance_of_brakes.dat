40|$|Over the years, {{numerous}} {{studies have been conducted}} for the development of alternative materials for better <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> pads. With a huge selection of materials, automobile manufacturers must prioritize the performance standards, safety, cost and environmental factors <b>of</b> the <b>brake</b> pads. To improve the friction <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> pads, maintain customers comfort level and environment safety, design engineers test and verify the best materials to satisfy the federal performance standards. Raw materials <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> pads compose <b>of</b> different categories such as organic, semi metallic and low-metallic. Besides the difference in composition, these materials affect the brake pads in terms of friction properties, wear rates and noise levels. It is crucial for engineers and manufacturers to improve friction stability while minimizing vibration by manipulating the composition of different raw materials and additive materials. Automotive brake pads normally consist of numerous metallic and composite materials that are formed by hot compression which can result in various mechanical properties [14]. This research proposes to investigate different composition of metallic raw materials and how their frictional performance is affected under different environmental testing standards. This research investigates the frictional <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> six types of raw materials with different mechanical properties and morphology using a universal mechanical tester (Bruker UMT). This paper examines the overall friction <b>performance,</b> coefficient <b>of</b> friction and creep groan behavior of six different raw materials under different humidity levels.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} parameters characterizing the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> materials is their formulation. Therefore, the precise analysis <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> materials is needed both to investigate formulation-performance relationship, and to maintain quality control. A typical brake composite contains more than ten phases (components), either crystalline or amorphous. Combinations of X-ray diffraction (XRD), light microscopy (LM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) are used to identify the phases present. However, the combination of these methods is insufficient for precise resolution of all phases in brake composites. The large number of phases can cause the overlapping of peaks in the XRD pattern, making them difficult to identify. This problem has been overcome by using density gradient centrifugation (DGC) to separate the powdered sample into density fractions that are easier to identify. The results of this study show that a combination of applied techniques can be effective in identifying brake formulation.

When we develop a simulation model for a full vehicle system, the characteristics of all com-ponents are generally properly simplified based on the understanding of each component’s purpose and interaction with other components. The friction coefficient between the brake disc and the pad used in simulations has been conventionally considered constant, {{and the effect of}} a variable friction coefficient is ignored with the assumption that the variability affects the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle <b>braking</b> very little.

Corrosion damage can adversely affect the material and bond properties in RC, which may lead to premature in-service failures. Several studies have investigated the effects of corrosion on the <b>residual</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> RC elements, such as under-reinforced beams; however a significant scatter is observed in the available experimental data. Lack of consistent interpretation of the available data is a major hurdle in reaching reliable conclusions on the behaviour of corroding members, leading to conservative estimation <b>of</b> their <b>residual</b> <b>performance</b> during assessment. In this paper, the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> corroding under-reinforced beams is investigated using the response surface method (RSM), in which non-linear finite element analysis (NLFEA) serves as “numerical experiments”.

Two novel p-methyl CS formulations were evaluated alongside the existing EC in laboratory bioassays and experimental hut trials in Tanzania between 2008 - 2010. Bioassays were carried out monthly on sprayed substrates of mud, concrete, plywood, and palm thatch to assess residual activity. Experimental huts {{were used to assess}} efficacy against wild free-flying Anopheles arabiensis, in terms of insecticide-induced mortality and blood-feeding inhibition. In laboratory bioassays of An. arabiensis and Culex quinquefasciatus both CS formulations produced high rates of mortality for significantly longer than the EC formulation on all substrates. On mud, the best performing CS killed > 80 % of An. arabiensis for five months and > 50 % for eight months, compared with one and two months, respectively, for the EC. In monthly bioassays of experimental hut walls the EC was ineffective shortly after spraying, while the best CS formulation killed more than 80 % of An. arabiensis for five months on mud, and seven months on concrete. In experimental huts both CS and EC formulations killed high proportions of free-flying wild An. arabiensis for up to 12 months after spraying.
