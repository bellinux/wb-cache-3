Although he and Carter successfully modify the disruptor, the Replicators adapt after only a single shot and infest Thor's ship. Meanwhile, Teal'c and Bra'tac are dismayed that, {{in the face of this}} unstoppable foe, the Jaffa are <b>re-pledging</b> their loyalty to the Goa'uld en masse and the future of the Jaffa rebellion is in doubt. They decide on an audacious, last-ditch plan: with Ba'al's forces occupied fighting the Replicators, the entire rebel army will capture Dakara, the holiest of Jaffa planets, thus proving once and for all that the Goa'uld are not gods. The rebel Jaffa find the planet lightly guarded and quickly seize its temple. However, at the behest of a robed figure, Ba'al breaks off the battle with the Replicators and sends his entire fleet towards Dakara.|$|E

40|$|Defence date: 15 September 2016 Examining Board: Professor Piero Gottardi, EUI, Supervisor; Professor William Fuchs, University of California Berkeley; Professor Andrea Galeotti, EUI; Professor Julien Hugonnier, EPFLAwarded the Vilfredo Pareto Prize for the 'Best Doctoral Thesis in Economics' at the European University Institute conferring {{ceremony}} on 9 June 2017 This thesis investigates theoretically how {{information and}} credit frictions affect {{the functioning of}} financial markets. I suggest that asymmetry of information about opaque assets may cause instability. The widespread use of these assets as collateral contributed to a severe credit contraction during the recent crisis. In this context, I propose a theory of collateral re-use, a technique designed to overcome shortages of high quality assets to secure credit. The first chapter shows that information frictions generate liquidity uctuations whereby asset prices move endogenously. In the model, buyers meet sellers in a decentralized market and do not know their asset quality. Prices and volume increase with the average quality of sellers since buyers {{are more willing to}} trade. However, high trading volume depletes the pool of future high quality sellers. Cyclical equilibria in price and volume are thus sustained endogenously. Temporary asset purchase programs can revive the market and smooth out uctuations. Finally, I show that increasing market centralization may harm liquidity provision and reduce welfare. The second chapter introduces collateral re-use in an economy where agents face limited commitment and must pledge a durable asset to borrow. Lenders may then re-sell a pledged asset or <b>re-pledge</b> it to secure further borrowing. Since lenders may now default and fail to return the collateral, net gains from collateral circulation are ambiguous. I show that benefits are larger in decentralized markets when agents trade trough intermediaries. The third chapter, joint with Piero Gottardi and Cyril Monnet, complements this analysis, focusing on repurchase agreements. In a repo, the borrower sells an asset to raise income and commits to a repurchase price to limit exposure to future market risk. If defaulting borrowers incur a cost over and above the loss of collateral, re-use is beneficial and increases leverage. We show that intermediation now arises endogenously: trustworthy agents - those with high cost of default - re-use collateral to borrow on behalf of riskier counterparties. [...] 1. Liquidity fluctuations in over the counter markets [...] 2. Re-using the collateral of others [...] 3. Repurchase agreement...|$|R
50|$|During {{the events}} of Rise of the Third Army, Bleez {{was one of the}} first Red Lanterns to {{encounter}} the Third Army, when she and several other Reds were attacked by Third Army drones on the planet of Arhtky. While Atrocitus rallied the rest of the Corps to confront the Guardians and the First Lantern, he ordered Rankorr to return to Earth and kill Baxter, the man who was indirectly responsible for his transformation into a Red Lantern. Bleez chose to accompany Rankorr, to ensure that the deed was done properly. Rankorr quickly found Baxter, but hesitated to kill him. Bleez responded by poisoning Baxter with her napalm blood, which Rankorr interpreted as her attempt to prove that she was still worthy of being a Red Lantern after nearly accepting a Star Sapphire ring from Fatality. Bleez admitted that she had indeed been tempted by Fatality's offer, and that a part of her longed to be something other than a Red Lantern, but that there was no other path for her, or for him. She then attempted to seduce Rankorr so that she could obtain his blood, which would allow her to create light constructs. Rankorr rejected her and escaped, attempting to live life as a human. Bleez tracked him down and again attempted to take his blood, but she was interrupted by Atrocitus, who issued an order for all Red Lanterns to hunt down and kill him, as he now deemed himself responsible for the destruction of his homeworld. She joined the rest of the Corps in attacking Atrocitus, during which he finally experienced the true depth of his Corps' rage. Declaring himself 'reborn', Atrocitus led the Red Lanterns to Oa to destroy the Guardians for good. They arrived at the climax of the battle with Volthoom, and aided in his defeat. In the aftermath of the battle, Bleez led the Red Lanterns back to Ysmault, where they found the Four Inversions attempting to destroy the central power battery. Their dark magic nearly defeated the assembled Lanterns, but Bleez was able to withstand their sorcery, and they fled. Skallox suggested that she ought to assume leadership of the Corps, but before she could decide one way or the other, Atrocitus returned to the planet, and she <b>re-pledged</b> her loyalty to him.|$|R
