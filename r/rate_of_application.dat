5000|$|There {{has been}} growing {{criticism}} of the court since the September 11, 2001 attacks. This is partly because the court sits ex parte - in other words, {{in the absence of}} anyone but the judge and the government present at the hearings.

The accusation of being a [...] "rubber stamp" [...] was rejected by FISA Court president Reggie B. Walton who {{wrote in a letter to}} Senator Patrick J.

[...] He added: [...] "There is a rigorous review process of applications submitted by the executive branch, spearheaded initially by five judicial branch lawyers who are national security experts and then by the judges, to ensure that the court’s authorizations comport with what the applicable statutes authorize." [...] In a following letter Walton stated that the government had revamped 24.4% of its requests in the face of court questions and demands in time from July 1, 2013 to September 30, 2013. This figure became available after Walton decided in the summer of 2013 that the FISC would begin keeping its own tally of how Justice Department warrant applications for electronic surveillance fared - and would track for the first time when the government withdrew or resubmitted those applications with changes. Some requests are modified by the court but ultimately granted, while the percentage of denied requests is statistically negligible (11 denied requests out of around 34,000 granted in 35 years - equivalent to 0.03%). The accusation that the FISC is a [...] "rubber stamp" [...] court was also rejected by Robert S. Litt (General Counsel of Office of the Director of National Intelligence): [...] "When Government prepares an application for section 215 order, it first submits to the FISC what's called a [...] "read copy", which the court staff will review and comment on. And they will almost invariably come back with questions, concerns, problems that they see. And there is an iterative process back and forth between the Government and the FISC to take care of those concerns so that at the end of the day, we're confident that we're presenting something that the FISC will approve.
