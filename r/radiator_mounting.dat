40|$|One of {{the final}} stages of {{microprocessors}} development is heat test. This procedure is performed on a special stand, the main element of which is the switching PCB with one or more mounted microprocessor sockets, chipsets, interfaces, jumpers and other components which provide various modes of microprocessor operation. The temperature of microprocessor housing is typically changed using thermoelectric module. The cold surface of the module with controlled temperature is in direct thermal contact with the microprocessor housing designed for cooler installation. On the hot surface of the module a radiator is mounted. The radiator dissipates the cumulative heat flow from both the microprocessor and the module. High density PCB layout, the requirement of free access to the jumpers and interfaces, and the presence of numerous sensors limit the space for <b>radiator</b> <b>mounting</b> and require the use of an extremely compact radiator, especially in air cooling conditions. One of the possible solutions for this problem may reduce the area of the radiator heat-transfer surfaces due to a sharp growth of the heat transfer coefficient without increasing the air flow rate. To ensure a sharp growth of heat transfer coefficient on the heat-transfer surface one should make in the surface one or more dead-end cavities into which the impact air jets would flow. CFD simulation of this type of radiator has been conducted. The heat-aerodynamic characteristics and design recommendations for removing heat from microprocessors in a limited space have been determined...|$|E

5000|$|S.91/4:The S.91 Leger, {{fitted with}} a [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Mb, flew again on 4 July 1930 with some modifications, {{including}} <b>radiators</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on top of the}} upper wing.|$|R
50|$|This new liquid-cooled engine fighter had a <b>radiator</b> <b>mounted</b> {{under the}} rear fuselagebut the {{prototype}} XP-40 was later modified and the radiator was moved forward under the engine.|$|R
2500|$|The {{principal}} {{difference between}} the two types was the engine. [...] The smaller Type 137 was designed for, and initially flown with, a 120hp (90kW) six-cylinder inline water-cooled Austro-Daimler, while the Type 138 had a 200hp (150kW) Salmson 2M7 14-cylinder water-cooled radial. [...] Engine choice determined the shape of the nose: the inline engine had a rectangular <b>radiator</b> <b>mounted</b> in front of it, projecting slightly above the upper fuselage line, whereas the radial was uncowled, with a pair of vertical <b>radiators</b> <b>mounted</b> in the small inner bays of the Type 138.|$|R
5000|$|Four {{aircraft}} {{similar to}} the C1, with the <b>radiator</b> <b>mounted</b> underneath, hydraulic shock absorbers and dual controls. Variously powered by [...] Curtiss OX-5, Wright-Hisso A, Wright Whirlwind and Menasco-Salmson radial engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was very fast but lacking in stability and control. At 150 mph (241 km/h), steep turns {{could not be}} made without applying full rudder. Engine overheating occurred during flight tests. The single centrally <b>mounted</b> <b>radiator</b> was replaced by two <b>radiators</b> <b>mounted</b> in the lower inner wings, but the problem was not fully cured. The small size of the cockpit restricted {{the movement of the}} pilot.|$|R
5000|$|The Sunbeam engine drove a {{four-bladed}} propeller {{and had a}} single, central, {{and nearly}} vertical exhaust pipe. [...] There were two <b>radiators,</b> <b>mounted</b> edge on (longitudinally) between the wings, rather than the single but similarly <b>mounted</b> <b>radiators</b> of the Avro 519s and the Avro 527. Two tank-like features are shown in both image and diagram on the lower wings just inboard of the innermost interplane struts; they may be fuel tanks.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} special design {{features}} help {{the engine to}} develop [...] A special fuel injection unit has ram tubes of larger cross section and 2510 longer {{than those of the}} regular production design. Individual exhaust pipes of a tuned length empty into large collector pipes and no mufflers are used. No cooling fan is required or used, and the water pump speed is reduced 30% by the use of a smaller crankshaft pulley. A small, 5-ampere generator is used in conjunction with a lightweight aircraft type battery In addition to the aluminum water pump mentioned previously, the engine cooling system consists of an aluminum <b>radiator</b> <b>mounted</b> forward of the driver, and two oil cooler <b>radiators</b> <b>mounted</b> one {{on each side of the}} main radiator.|$|R
50|$|The F.6M {{prototype}} first flew in September 1941, using a large <b>radiator</b> <b>mounted</b> under he nose, {{just behind}} the propeller. Flight testing showed that this location produced significant aerodynamic drag, and the prototype was reworked to <b>mount</b> the <b>radiator</b> on the belly, aft of the pilot position.|$|R
5000|$|The HD.6 was {{powered by}} a [...] Salmson 18Z two row, 18-cylinder radial engine, {{water-cooled}} by three circular section <b>radiators</b> <b>mounted</b> between the legs of its fixed conventional undercarriage. This had mainwheels on a single axle attached by V-struts to the lower fuselage, assisted by a tailskid.|$|R
40|$|The masters {{thesis is}} focused on design of the device for {{measurement}} of the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on <b>radiators</b> <b>mounted</b> in the wind tunnel test section. The thesis also includes {{the analysis of the}} aerodynamic drag which is produced by radiators and the LabView application software development...|$|R
50|$|The Trident 3 chassis was {{developed}} from Dennis Lance/Arrow. It had a longitudinally-mounted rear engine, with a <b>radiator</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the right}} hand side of the engine. An auxiliary axle was mounted behind the second axle {{to cope with the}} weight at the rear and reduce the rear overhang.|$|R

50|$|Self-launching {{engines are}} {{equipped}} with a throttle that allows the engine power to be adjusted for ground operations. Self-launching engines are typically {{in the range of}} 50-60 hp (38-45 kW). The higher engine output power requires liquid cooling with a separate <b>radiator</b> <b>mounted</b> on the propeller mast. Engines commonly used are two-stroke piston engines, or Wankel rotary engines.|$|R
50|$|The Trident 2 chassis {{features}} a transversely mounted engine {{on the right}} side, with the <b>radiator</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the left side}} of the engine compartment. It could be fitted with C-series Euro II engine (later Cummins ISCe Euro III engine), coupled to Voith DIWA or ZF Ecomat gearbox. It was available with Alexander ALX400, Plaxton President and East Lancs Lolyne/Myllennium Lolyne bodywork.|$|R
50|$|The Baby was {{powered by}} a 30 hp (22 kW) Alvaston twin-cylinder, horizontally-opposed, {{water-cooled}} engine in the nose. It drove a two-blade propeller and was cooled {{by a pair of}} rectangular <b>radiators,</b> <b>mounted</b> longitudinally on the top edges of the fuselage, between the engine and the pilot, with their top edges attached to the lower surface of the upper wing.|$|R
2500|$|The G.I was a biplane with {{a span of}} over [...] [...] Although it had twin pusher {{propellers}} mounted {{between the}} wings and an Idflieg G designation (heavy bomber), it had only a single engine, mounted in the fuselage over the centre of gravity and linked to the propellers by gears and shafts. Hazet <b>radiators</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the sides of}} the fuselage between the wings provided cooling to the adjacent engine.|$|R
50|$|The <b>radiator</b> was <b>mounted</b> vertically, {{directly}} behind the front wheels, and the semi-elliptic leaf springs were of substantial construction.|$|R
5|$|Tauranac signed double world {{champion}} Graham Hill and young Australian Tim Schenken to drive for the 1971 season. Tauranac designed the unusual 'lobster claw' BT34, featuring twin <b>radiators</b> <b>mounted</b> {{ahead of the}} front wheels, a single example of which was built for Hill. Although Hill, no longer a front-runner since his 1969 accident, took his final Formula One win in the non-championship BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone, the team scored only sevenchampionship points.|$|R
50|$|The {{flight deck}} was {{enclosed}} on the A.32 and {{was incorporated into}} the fuselage below and ahead of the high-mounted thick wing. The passenger cabin was under and aft of the wing. The tailskid undercarriage featured a wider tread on the mainwheels, and those wheels were supported by struts running up to the wings undersides. The nose-mounted piston engine was cooled by a <b>radiator,</b> <b>mounted</b> in the airstream on {{the belly of the}} fuselage, under the flight deck.|$|R
50|$|Front-wheel drive layout {{had been}} highly {{impacted}} {{by the success of}} small, inexpensive cars, especially the British Mini. As engineered by Alec Issigonis, the compact arrangement located the transmission and engine sharing a single oil sump — despite disparate lubricating requirements — and had the engines <b>radiator</b> <b>mounted</b> {{to the side of the}} engine, away from the flow of fresh air and drawing heated rather than cool air over the engine. The layout often required the engine be removed to service the clutch.|$|R
50|$|Design {{of the car}} broadly {{followed}} Broadley's {{experience in}} the Formula Junior category, with a steel spaceframe chassis braced by bulkheads in front and behind the driver. The engine was carried within the chassis, and cooling was by a <b>radiator</b> <b>mounted</b> {{at the front of}} the bodywork; two tubes of the spaceframe acting as coolant pipes to and from the engine. Following supply delays with Coventry Climax's new V8 engine, the cars were initially built up around the older, inline 4-cylinder FPF engine.|$|R

50|$|The Caterpillar Sixty {{was famous}} for its {{overhanging}} <b>radiator,</b> individually <b>mounted</b> cylinders, lever controls, andopen clutch. It was to rival the Holt 10 Ton model.|$|R
50|$|The NiD 121 {{was tested}} {{by representatives of}} the Peru Air Force in September 1933, and an order was made for six {{aircraft}} that could be fitted with either wheeled or floatplane undercarriages. A prototype of the Peruvian fighter flying on 18 July 1934. A final version, the NiD 125, was built for evaluation by the Armée de l'Air, featuring a more powerful Hispano-Suiza 12Y engine with provision for a 20 mm cannon firing through the propeller hub, and with the wing <b>mounted</b> <b>radiators</b> replaced by more conventional <b>radiators</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the sides of}} the fuselage. The sole prototype flew in June 1934, but despite good performance, a similarly powered and armed version of the Dewoitine D500, the D.510 was chosen for production.|$|R
50|$|The Dewoitine D.30 first {{appeared}} in public at the Paris Aero Show in December 1930. It was a single-engine, ten-seat passenger aircraft with a high cantilever wing and rectangular-section fuselage. It had a fabric-covered metal frame and was powered by a 485 kW (650 hp) Hispano-Suiza 12Nbr water cooled, upright V-12 engine. This engine was closely cowled, the cowling following {{the profile of the}} two cylinder banks, and drove a two-blade propeller; it was cooled with a Lamblin <b>radiator</b> <b>mounted</b> ventrally at its rear.|$|R
50|$|The MB-3 was {{a single}} seat two-bay biplane of similar layout to the SPAD XIII that it was {{intended}} to replace. It was of wood and fabric construction with a fixed conventional landing gear. Powerplant was the expected Wright-Hispano water-cooled V-8 engine driving a two-bladed propeller and cooled by a <b>radiator</b> <b>mounted</b> on the center-section of the upper wing. The pilot sat in an open cockpit under a cut-out in the upper wing, with two 0.30 in Marlin machine-guns mounted ahead of the pilot.|$|R
5000|$|The {{resulting}} aircraft, {{designated the}} Gloster II, was a floatplane development of Gloster's earlier Gloster I racing aircraft, which {{had won the}} annual Aerial Derby air race three years running between 1921 and 1923, and had attempted unsuccessfully to break the World airspeed record in 1922. [...] It was a small single-seat biplane of fabric covered wooden construction, powered by a closely faired Napier Lion engine. It had short-span single bay wings and a twin float undercarriage, with <b>radiators</b> <b>mounted</b> on the struts supporting the floats.|$|R
