40|$|Purpose Dynamic market {{segmentation}} {{is a very}} important topic in many businesses where it is interesting to gain knowledge on the <b>reference</b> <b>market</b> and on its evolution over time. Various papers in the reference literature are devoted to the topic and different statistical models are proposed. In this paper two statistical approaches to model categorical longitudinal data to perform dynamic {{market segmentation}} are compared. Methodology The latent class Markov model identifies a latent variable which states represent market segments at an initial point in time, customers can switch to one segment to another between consecutive measurement occasions and a regression structure models the effects of covariates, describing customers’ characteristics, on segments belonging and transition probabilities. The latent class growth approach models individual trajectories, describing a behaviour over time. Customers’ characteristics may be inserted in the model to affect trajectories that may vary across latent groups, in our case, market segments. Findings The two approaches reveal both suitable for dynamic market segmentation. The advice to marketer analysts is to explore both solutions to dynamically segment the <b>reference</b> <b>market.</b> The best approach will be then judged in terms of fit, substantial results and assumptions on the <b>reference</b> <b>market.</b> Originality The proposed statistical models are new in the field of financial markets...|$|R

50|$|A <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> is {{a period}} of one year (or {{sometimes}} less), designated for reporting and (or) analysis of production, marketing and disposition of a commodity. (Disposition of an agricultural crop might include such uses as food, animal feed, industry, seed, and export, as well as changes in stocks.) Because of year-to-year fluctuations in production, much marketing and disposition of some commodities may reflect production that occurred during a previous calendar year. For this reason, analysis is often facilitated if the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> for a crop commences at about the time of harvest.

40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on a {{description}} of the winegrowing and wine-production in Australia, a country, which is becoming a more and more significant producer and exporter of wine in the world, and has become a part of competitive environment of the winegrowing and wine-production industry in the Czech Republic. Structural analysis of external environment is a part of strategic analysis of an industry, where one of the key parts is the analysis of competitive environment within an industry. Winegrowing areas of Australia are nowadays located mostly in the colder climatic zone of Australia. In the 70 -ies of the last century, there were planted new vineyards, in these areas, and the grapes from them have started to be used for production of quality-wine and the production of sweet wines and brandies have decreased. The most significant wine-production state has become the South Australia with the sound vineyards around the Murray River. The area of the productive vineyards has doubled, in the past seven years; most of the vineyards are under irrigation. The total grape production in the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2001 – 2002 was 1   514   501  t, where 56 % were the blue grapes. In the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2001 – 2002, there was produced 1   220  mil. litres of wine and 416  mil. litres were exported., whereas in the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2002 – 2003 the exports amounted for 508  mil. litres of wine. Most of the wine was exported to the Great Britain – in the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2001 – 2002 it was 48 % of the total exports. In 2003 – 2004, were exported to the Czech Republic 466   914  litres of wine, which is an 850 % growth within the past four years. The average price of 1 litre of wine imported to the Czech Republic was 2. 16  €, in the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2002 – 2003, and have grown by 0. 28  € in the following year. Wine imports to Australia are decreasing from the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 1997 – 1998. In the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2002 – 2003, the imports were 17  mil. litres of wine, for 81  mil €. Consumption of all alcoholic drinks recounted to the per capita and per year level is decreasing in Australia; from the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 1977 – 1978 it have fallen by 26 % to the year 1999 – 2000, but the wine consumption have grown by 43. 6 % in the same period.
