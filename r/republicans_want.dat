2500|$|Obama {{supports}} {{embryonic stem}} cell research and was a co-sponsor of the 2005 Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act which was passed by both houses of Congress but vetoed by President Bush. Obama condemned Bush's veto, saying, [...] "Democrats want this bill to pass. Conservative, pro-life <b>Republicans</b> <b>want</b> this bill to pass. By large margins, the American people want this bill to pass. It is only the White House {{standing in the way of}} progress – standing in the way of so many potential cures." [...] He also voted in favor of the 2007 bill lifting restrictions on {{embryonic stem cell}} research that was passed but was also vetoed by President Bush.|$|E
2500|$|On February 24, 2009, Jindal {{delivered}} the official Republican response to President Obama's address {{to a joint}} session of Congress. Jindal called the president's economic stimulus plan [...] "irresponsible" [...] and argued against government intervention. He used Hurricane Katrina to warn against government solutions to the economic crisis. [...] "Today in Washington, some are promising that government will rescue us from the economic storms raging all around us," [...] Jindal said. [...] "Those of us who lived through Hurricane Katrina, we have our doubts." [...] He praised the late sheriff Harry Lee for standing up to the government during Katrina. The speech met with biting reviews from some members of both the Democratic and the Republican parties. Referring to Jindal as [...] "devoid of substantive ideas for governing the country", political commentator Rachel Maddow summarized Jindal's Katrina remark as follows: [...] " [...] since government failed during Hurricane Katrina, we should understand, not that government {{should not be allowed to}} fail again, but that government...never works. That government can't work, and therefore we should stop seeking a functioning government." [...] David Johnson, a Republican political strategist criticized Jindal's mention of Hurricane Katrina, stating [...] "The one thing <b>Republicans</b> <b>want</b> to forget is Katrina." [...] While Jindal's speech was poorly received by several Democratic and Republican critics, others argued that the speech should be judged on substance rather than delivery style.|$|E

5000|$|Ezra Klein of The Washington Post {{has written}} that the Hastert Rule is [...] "more of an aspiration" [...] than a rule and that codifying it as a formal rule would be {{detrimental}} to House Republicans, as it would prevent them from voting against bills that the <b>Republican</b> caucus <b>wanted</b> passed but {{that a majority of}} <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> to oppose for ideological or political reasons.|$|R
60|$|But {{although}} the peasants rejoiced, their leaders {{knew that the}} struggle could not long continue. The number of fighting men--that is to say, of the whole male population of La Vendee capable of bearing arms--had diminished terribly; indeed, the number that originally responded to the summons of the church bells was decreased by fully a half. Food was scarce. Owing to the continued absence of the peasants the harvest had, in many places, not been garnered; and wherever the Republican troops had passed, the destruction had been complete. A {{large portion of the}} population were homeless. The very movements of the Vendeans were hampered by the crowds of women and children who, with the few belongings that they had saved, packed in their little carts, wandered almost aimlessly through the country. Many of the towns were in ruins, and deserted; in all save a few secluded spots, as yet unvisited by the <b>Republicans,</b> <b>want</b> and misery were universal.|$|E

5000|$|William L.

5000|$|A 2012 {{paper by}} six American {{political}} scientists called [...] "A Theory of Political Parties: Groups, Policy Demands and Nominations in American Politics" [...] challenged {{the idea that}} <b>Republicans</b> <b>want</b> a low-information electorate, and argued instead that both major American parties do. Noting that 95% of incumbents in the highly polarized House of Representatives win re-election despite voters' preference for centrist representation, the paper theorizes that voters' infrequent penalizing of extremist behaviour represents not approval, but a lack of attention and information. This, the paper says, {{is supported by the}} fact that when congressional districts and media markets overlap to create more informed electorates, extremist House members are at much greater risk for defeat. The paper proposes that in the American political system, interest groups, and activists are the key actor, and the electorate is uninformed and bamboozled.|$|E

5000|$|Supreme {{discussed}} his political views in a 2008 promotional video. He stated he was registered as a Republican at that time, {{but that he}} leaned toward anarchism.

[...] Supreme's vision of anarchism holds no need for government, but depends on citizens {{to take responsibility for}} themselves and for others, citing [...] "mutual aid and support and care to our fellow citizens" [...] as key elements. To that end, Supreme called for a gradual dismantling of the government, while citizens take up the slack.

Grant denied Cutler's claim, calling it [...] "100 percent false", stating that while he had met with Cutler, that subject was not discussed. He added that the party had been focused solely on getting Mike Michaud or Chellie Pingree to run for governor. Cutler stated {{that he would be}} willing to sign an affidavit on the matter, as he remembered the conversation [...] "very clearly". Attorney and Democratic activist Severin Beliveau disputed Cutler's claim that he had been offered a [...] "cleared field", saying: [...] "That's Cutler's ego.
