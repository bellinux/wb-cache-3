50|$|The {{river is}} never wide nor fast flowing, {{although}} it does flood periodically. It drifts through the gentle rolling countryside of north-east Leicestershire by fields bounded by hawthorn hedges. There is very little woodland in the area, what's there is largely man-made {{in the form of}} fox coverts. Farming in the district is largely pastoral, with the grassland given over to sheep and cows, the traditional beasts of local agriculture. Stilton and Red <b>Leicester</b> <b>cheeses</b> originally came from the village and farm dairies in the Eye basin.|$|R

50|$|Statutory {{planning}} protection {{came too}} late for at least 30 of Stoneygate's 19th century mansions. These large buildings in extensive grounds proved too tempting a target for profit in the mid-20th century, when substantial blocks of flats or estates of houses could replace a single unwanted mansion. Several of the earliest houses in the suburb were lost in this way, including 'The Stoney Gate', a 17th-century farmhouse converted into a mansion in the 1820s, demolished in 1962. The Shrubbery (1845) was demolished to build the Stoneygate Court flats in 1934 and Elmsleigh Hall, built in 1874 for John Stafford, a <b>Leicester</b> <b>cheese</b> and provisions merchant, was demolished in 1935 {{to make way for}} Elmsleigh Avenue.|$|R

Someone kills a rabbit. Someone catches a fish. A grumpy old lady sends Christmas cards. All the stories have that well-told, underwritten quality of the fairytale or the fable: occasionally, and at their very best, they also have the necessary fairytale bite and discomfort...The experience of reading this collection is rather like being wrapped in a tartan blanket and handed a nice mug of cocoa. Treats on offer include the adventures of Colonel Pericles [...] "Perry" [...] Barkwell, tales of the pipe-smoking Polly Wantage, and the sorry story of the poor old general who is slowly losing his mind. There is a mysterious [...] "hedging and ditching" [...] man and a dog called Archibald Scott-Moncrieff. And of course Obadiah Oak, the village's literal and proverbial last peasant, who [...] "exudes the aromas of wet leather and horse manure, costive dogs, turnips, rainwater and cabbage water, sausages, verdigris, woollen socks, <b>Leicester</b> <b>cheese,</b> fish guts, fraying curtains, mice under the stairs, mud on the carpet and woodlice behind the pipes"." ...|$|R

50|$|Red Leicester (also known {{simply as}} <b>Leicester</b> or Leicestershire <b>Cheese)</b> is an English cheese, made {{in a similar manner}} to Cheddar cheese, {{although}} it is crumblier, sold at 3 to 12 months of age. The rind is reddish-orange with a powdery mould on it. Since the 18th century it has been coloured orange by adding annatto extract during manufacture. It is a cow's milk cheese, originally from Leicestershire, England, and is named after the city of Leicester. Traditionally made wheels are fairly firm and dry, with a friable texture and a slightly sweet mellow flavour that becomes stronger as the cheese matures. Block-made cheeses are moister, and have a slightly sweet aftertaste and a creamy texture. It has a slightly nutty taste. Versions sold in supermarkets are typically coloured with annatto, although it is possible to obtain Red Leicester without it.|$|R
