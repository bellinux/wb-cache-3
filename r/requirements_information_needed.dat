40|$|The key {{problems}} {{addressed by}} this work are: (1) {{how to run}} high-end applications on embedded systems, (2) how to provide high levels of flexibility in how, where, and when necessary processing and communication actions are performed, and (3) how to continuously meet end-user needs despite run-time variations in service locations, platform capabilities, and user requirements. Our approach addresses these problems by offering the following components. First, the InfoFabric platform supports flexibility in communication and processing. It is a lightweight publish /subscribe middleware end-users can use to subscribe to information channels of interest to them whenever they desire, and apply exactly the processing to such information they require, such that processing and communication actions are dynamically mapped to the underlying distributed embedded platforms. Second, to attain high performance and to meet embedded systems requirements like low power, new compiler and binary code generation techniques dynamically generate and install code. Run-time code generation customizes code in order to match current user needs to available platform resources. Third, to deal with run-time changes in resource availability, a kernel-level resource management mechanisms, called Q-fabric, is associated with middleware. Combined, these mechanisms efficiently carry the performance, usage, and <b>requirements</b> <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> for runtime adaptation of processing and communication actions...|$|E

One critical success factor of data warehouse development is determining <b>information</b> <b>requirements.</b> Hence, the method focuses on gathering of <b>requirements</b> and <b>information</b> <b>needs</b> of the users first. An extended data warehouse architecture and a technique for decomposition of the system serve as a developing framework. On the one hand this framework is used to define releases (builds) of the system, which is indispensable for an incremental development process. On the other hand it defines intermediate and final work products (artifacts) that are produced and used during further development stages. Starting with <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> elicitation, each increment is realized {{through a series of}} data models which successively are transformed from conceptual to logical level. These logical data models are then used for implementation {{as well as for the}} modelling of ETL processes. ...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach – A case study of a leading international global built asset and engineering consultancy organization was conducted over two years. The case study was conducted principally using semi-participant observations supplemented with other qualitative data collection methods (i. e. interviews, questionnaires and document analysis). Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data.

These organizations struggle with becoming data-driven, because their communities still live {{outside of the}} reach of modern data infrastructure, which is crucial for delivering effective modern services.

The amount of information available to support each mission is constrained by the availability of information assets.

Therefore, options for satisfying <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> should take into consideration constraints on the underlying information assets, which in certain cases could simultaneously support multiple missions.
