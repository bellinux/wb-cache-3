40|$|Abstract: The {{articular}} disc in the temporomandibular joint {{plays an}} important role in mandibular growth. Functional appliances induce <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle even after condylectomy. The aim of this study was to examine the role of the articular disc in <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle after unilateral condylectomy with use of a functional appliance in growing rats. Fifty growing rats were subjected to unilateral condylectomy and then half of them underwent discectomy. The functional appliance was applied to half of the rats in each group to induce <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle. Four and eight weeks later, morphometric and histologic analyses of the mandible were performed. <b>Regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle was demonstrated in the two condylectomy groups. In the condylectomy+appliance group, the shape and cartilage of the condyle were equivalent to a normal condyle. However, <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle was not observed in the two discectomy groups even with the use of the functional appliance. The articular disc appears to be crucial in the <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> a damaged condyle, suggesting that defects or damage to the articular disc may influence mandibular growth and <b>regeneration</b> or repair <b>of</b> the condyle.

In this paper we assess whether <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> sclerophyllous forests shows nucleated patterns {{indicative of a}} positive effect of vegetation remnants at the landscape level and compare the regeneration patterns between sites with distinctive climate conditions. We studied the spatial patterns of vegetation change during 52 years in central Chile using remotely-sensed images to test the predictions that (1) <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> sclerophyllous vegetation expands from patches of remnant vegetation; and (2) regeneration is more dependent on remnant vegetation in drier sites. Our {{results show that the}} <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the sclerophyllous vegetation in central Chile is a slow process that may be possible under certain conditions. We found that the fraction of regenerated vegetation increases with the proximity to remnant sclerophyllous forest in an aggregated pattern.

The process <b>of</b> <b>co-factor</b> <b>regeneration</b> was studied by analysing the intracellular pools of NADH and storage material during {{the production of}} 1, 2 -epoxypropane from propene. With the depletion of NADH the production of 1, 2 -epoxypropane stopped. NADH could be regenerated from the oxidation of added co-substrate or from oxidation of storage material. Cells cultivated in chemostat culture under nitrogen limitation produced more 1, 2 -epoxypropane compared to cells cultivated under carbon limitation, due to their higher content of storage material. Addition of glucose to cells grown under carbon limitation stimulated the formation of 1, 2 -epoxypropane. The uptake of glucose resulted in the accumulation of storage material, which was utilized after depletion of the glucose. Glycogen and trehalose were the preferred forms of storage material used for co-factor regeneration.

We examined whether chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) promotes the axonal <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> rubrospinal tract (RST) neurons following injury to the spinal cord. The effect of a GSK- 3 β inhibitor, lithium chloride (LiCl), on the <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> axotomized RST neurons was also assessed. Adult rats received a unilateral hemisection at the seventh cervical spinal cord segment (C 7). Four weeks after different treatments, <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> RST axons across the lesion scar was examined by injection of Fluoro-Gold at spinal segment T 2, and locomotor recovery was studied by a test of forelimb usage. Injured RST axons did not regenerate spontaneously after spinal cord injury, and intraperitoneal injection of LiCl alone did not promote the <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> RST axons. Administration of ChABC at the lesion site enhanced the <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> RST axons by 20 %. Combined treatment of LiCl together with ChABC significantly increased the <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> RST axons to 42 %. Animals receiving combined treatment used both forelimbs together more often than animals that received sham or single treatment. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that LiCl induced the expression of inactive GSK- 3 β {{as well as the}} upregulation of Bcl- 2 in injured RST neurons. These results indicate that in vivo, LiCl inhibits GSK- 3 β and reinforces the regeneration-promoting function of ChABC through a Bcl- 2 -dependent mechanism.
