5000|$|Porsche {{revealed}} the latest Spyder model in April 2015 at the New York Auto Show. The styling {{of the car}} {{is similar to the}} previous generation Spyder, continuing the twin hump rear deck and manually operated canvas top. It also shares some styling with the Cayman GT4, using the same front and rear fascia. The engine is also shared with the Cayman GT4, a 3.8l flat-6, making this the largest capacity and most powerful engine used in a Boxster with [...] It is also the lightest current Porsche, weighing 1315 kg. This was achieved through the use of aluminum doors and <b>rear</b> <b>lid,</b> the manually operated roof and unique light weight 20 inch wheels. The air conditioning and audio system are also removed, although can be added as no cost options. Braking is via larger brakes than used on the Boxster S, being 340mm front and 330mm rear units taken from the 911 Carrera S. It also shares from the GT4 a limited slip differential combined with Porsche Torque Vectoring and features a 30mm lower ride height. Additionally it also borrows the steering rack from the 911 Turbo S along with the same reduced diameter GT steering wheel as used in both the GT3 and GT4. The only gearbox available is a 6 speed manual. The Spyder had a base price of US$82,100 and was only available as a 2016 model with a total worldwide production of 2400 units, 850 US (ref?).|$|E

50|$|On 6 December 2014, Proton {{introduced}} the Suprima S Standard, a new base model variant which undercuts the Suprima S Executive {{by as much}} as RM6,900. The Suprima S Standard loses some equipment and trim, including several safety features, and offers several new, albeit downgraded components to achieve its lower pricing. The omissions include several interior components like the Android OS-powered Proton Infotainment System in favour of the more basic head-unit from the Proton Prevé Executive variant, as well as the lack of steering audio switches, YES 4G internet connectivity, and the <b>rear</b> <b>lid</b> on the floor console between the two front seats. On the exterior, the Suprima S loses the front foglights, engine cover and the black tape on the B-pillar sashes. The Suprima S Standard is fitted with the ten-spoke alloy rims first seen on the Proton Prevé, and not the hubcaps from the Proton Exora Bold Standard CFE as speculated from spyshots several days prior to the launch. The most significant omissions in the Suprima S Standard are its safety features; it is only equipped with dual front airbags, ABS and EBD, and is not equipped with side and curtain airbags, electronic stability control (ESC), traction control (TCS) and brake assist (BA), which are all offered in the Suprima S Executive. The anti-trap feature in the front power windows, front reactive headrest, driver-side overhead handle grip and seat belt reminder for the front passenger have also been omitted. Nonetheless, the Suprima S Standard comes with a new Panther Grey finish for the front dashboard panels and front position lamps which are of the bulb type, instead of the L.E.D. type on the Executive trim. The rest of the specifications, including the powertrain were left largely unchanged, and the Proton Suprima S Standard is priced at RM69,438 and RM69,888 for the solid and metallic paint options respectively, both on-the-road prices with insurance. Proton hopes to triple sales of the Suprima S with this new base model.|$|E
