5|$|The {{audiences that}} we built for those campaigns {{are having a}} {{different}} experience. They’re having a collective experience in which they literally bring different pieces, one to the next, swap them back and forth, gossip about them. They have an element of cocreation and a collaborative nature that doesn’t <b>really</b> <b>have</b> an analog that I’ve been able to think of in the arts.|$|E
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{struck his}} contemporaries as a sad figure, a loner with few friends in cricket. He rarely {{encouraged}} young players or gave out praise. He liked {{to mix with}} middle-class people, spending money he did not <b>really</b> <b>have,</b> leading to accusations of snobbery. Team-mates regarded him as moody, private and uncommunicative. Often silent {{in the company of}} others, he could be arrogant and unfriendly. Charlie Barnett and Charles Dacre, two of his Gloucestershire team-mates, came almost to hate him. Dacre often played in a reckless way of which Hammond disapproved; Hammond, in turn, may have been jealous of him. Hammond once tried hard to injure Dacre by bowling fast at him while he was wicketkeeper. Barnett began as a close friend but fell out over Hammond's treatment of his first wife and later his refusal to play in Barnett's benefit match. Other players who were involved in disputes with Hammond included Denis Compton, whose cavalier approach Hammond disliked, and Learie Constantine, who believed Hammond insulted him in the West Indies in 1925, although the two later made peace. Hammond's ultimate rivalry was with Bradman, who overshadowed him throughout his career, and with whom he developed an increasing obsession. It was not enough for Hammond to be the second-best batsman in the world, and he disliked the constant comparisons made between them in Bradman's favour. He felt not only that he had to do well, but also that he had to score more than Bradman.|$|E

25|$|Weather {{along the}} route is typical of Connecticut. This trail does not <b>really</b> <b>have</b> any exposed ridge tops or summits. Snow is common {{in the winter and}} may necessitate the use of snowshoes. Ice can form on exposed ledges and summits, making hiking {{dangerous}} without special equipment.|$|E

25|$|Embrun {{also has}} an Industrial Park. Despite the name, the Industrial Park doesn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> any industry, just semi-industrial {{commerce}} such as warehouses.

25|$|While rumoured, {{due to the}} {{departure}} of actor Dan Stevens, the death of Matthew Crawley, in the 2012 Christmas special, drew criticism. Lord Fellowes defended the decision stating that they 'didn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> an option' once Stevens decided to leave. Stevens later {{said that he had}} no say in the manner of his character's departure but that he was 'sorry' his character had died on Christmas Day.|$|E
25|$|In the 1730s, a {{faction of}} Iroquois leaders opened a {{diplomatic}} {{relationship with the}} British Province of Pennsylvania, facilitated by Conrad Weiser, Pennsylvania's interpreter and agent. Pennsylvania agreed to recognize the Iroquois {{as the owner of}} all Indian lands in Pennsylvania; the Iroquois, in turn, agreed to sell lands only to Pennsylvania. Canasatego probably attended a 1736 treaty where some Iroquois chiefs sold land along the Susquehanna River to Pennsylvania, even though the Iroquois did not <b>really</b> <b>have</b> a claim to this land.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} that the Army of the Holy War and the Palestinian forces were in was worse. They could {{not rely on}} any form of foreign support and had to get by on the funds that Mohammad Amin al-Husayni could raise. The troops' armament was limited to what the fighters already had. To make things even worse, {{they had to be}} content with arms bought on the black market or pillaged from British warehouses, and, as a result, did not <b>really</b> <b>have</b> enough arms to wage war.|$|E
25|$|The King's full {{baptismal name}} was Siaosi Tāufaʻāhau Tupoulahi, {{but he was}} soon better known by the {{traditional}} title reserved for Crown Princes: Tupoutoʻa, (bestowed in 1937) later replaced by the title he inherited from his father: Tungī (or using both: Tupoutoʻa-Tungī, in that time written as Tuboutoʻa-Tugi). He kept the Tungī title until his death. From a traditional point of view {{he was not only}} the Tungī, which is the direct descendent from the Tuʻi Haʻatakalaua, but he was also, on becoming king, the 22nd Tuʻi Kanokupolu. The link with the Tuʻi Tonga, was more indirect. He was not a Tuʻi Tonga too (as that office has gone over into the Kalaniuvalu line), but his grandmother Lavinia Veiongo (wife of George Tupou II) was the great-granddaughter of Laufilitonga, the last Tuʻi Tonga, and his wife Halaevalu Mataʻaho (not {{to be confused with the}} King's wife of the same name and same family), who was the daughter of Tupou ʻAhomeʻe, who was the daughter of Lātūfuipeka, the Tamahā (sister of the Tuʻi Tonga). By consequence, the King's daughter, Pilolevu, was the first woman in Tongan culture to <b>really</b> <b>have</b> the blood of the three major Royal dynasties in her veins and become the highest-ranking person ever.|$|E
25|$|Ian meets Karen Taylor (Lorraine Stanley) who {{has just}} moved into the Square with her family. Ian reluctantly employs Karen, who quits after Ian refuses to let her take burgers away for her children. Ian and Jane are later devastated when they learn that Steven has a brain tumour, {{but he has been}} {{secretly}} lying about this {{in a desperate attempt to}} stay with Lauren. Jane has been developing a Walford in Bloom event and on the day of the event, an unnoticed gas leak throws the whole Square into danger. Unbeknownst to Ian, Jane has discovered Steven's lie and that Max has not really forgiven them and is secretly planning revenge. In a bid to get rid of Jane, Max forces Steven to kill her. As a result, Steven sets fire to the restaurant, trapping Jane inside. Steven later has a change of heart and tries to save Jane, but is violently shoved into a table by Max, who leaves Jane to die. However, while Jane is rescued, Steven dies of a liver bleed. Ian, Kathy and Lauren are shocked when they learn that Steven did not <b>really</b> <b>have</b> a brain tumour. A disgusted Lauren declares that his funeral will not be taking place and only Abi attends. Ian is thrilled when Jane awakens from her coma. Max forces Jane to leave Walford with Ian. But, James Wilmott-Brown (William Boyde), who is working with Max and who also raped Kathy years ago, orders Max to ensure that Ian remains in Walford. Therefore, Max blackmails Jane into leaving Walford alone, threatening harm to Bobby if she does not. A heart-broken Jane leaves Walford without Ian, leaving him shattered. Ian allows Lauren and Louie to move back in with him. Ian tells Abi about making Beales into a franchise to pass onto Louie. Abi announces to Ian that he will have another grandchild as she is pregnant with Steven's baby, news that Ian does not take well. Ian informs Max of Abi's pregnancy.|$|E
