40|$|The {{effects on}} system {{efficiency}} of excess <b>refrigerant</b> <b>line</b> length are calculated for an idealized residential {{heating and cooling}} system. By excess line length is meant refrigerant tubing {{in excess of the}} 25 R provided for in standard equipment efficiency test methods. The purpose of the calculation is to provide input for a proposed method for evaluating refrigerant distribution system efficiency. A refrigerant distribution system uses refrigerant (instead of ducts or pipes) to carry heat and/or cooling effect from the equipment to the spaces in the building in which it is used. Such systems would include so-called mini-splits as well as more conventional split systems that {{for one reason or another}} have the indoor and outdoor coils separated by more than 25 ft. This report performs first-order calculations of the effects on system efficiency, in both the heating and cooling modes, of pressure drops within the refrigerant lines and of heat transfer between the refrigerant lines and the space surrounding them...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{energy audits}} {{generally}} focus on optimization of manufacturing process systems but fail {{to focus on}} the non-process industrial HVAC systems. This is in spite of the well-documented widespread prevalence of efficiency degrading faults occurring in the HVAC systems used in these facilities. Since these unitary air conditioners are not the primary energy consumers in the facility, energy auditors of IAC can find it difficult and time-consuming to identify air conditioning faults and justify their repair with a monetary value without the use of a quick tool. Existing methods and tools require system specific models or manufacturer?s map models that are not easily available to energy auditors. The proposed automated fault detection and diagnostic device for unitary air conditioners overcomes these challenges. It uses 7 surface temperature and 2 pressure sensors, with easily obtainable information to detect refrigerant undercharge, refrigerant overcharge, liquid line restriction, condenser fouling and evaporator fouling faults, and also predict the related energy and cost saving for each fault. It generates ?features? from the sensor inputs that are sensitive to the fault, but less sensitive to operating conditions. The fault detection rules are based on whether a set of features are High, Low or Normal in comparison to the thresholds. Multiple fault detection is achieved by first checking for charge related faults and then checking for fouling faults in presence or absence of the charge related faults. The developed device was tested for individual and multiple faults with systems using thermal expansion valve and fixed orifice valve. Results showed that the sensitivity of the device was good for <b>refrigerant</b> <b>line</b> faults but not as good for the fouling faults. Results of the multiple fault tests showed that the device could detect {{at least one of the}} two faults, generally the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>line</b> fault, over 60 % of the time. Overall, the device gave conservative estimates of energy and cost savings, which is usually preferred by IAC energy auditors. Finally, the device was also prepared for field tests, to verify that it was quick, low cost and easy to use. It took about 20 minutes to install the device that cost less than $ 2, 500...|$|E
50|$|Soft (or ductile) {{copper tubing}} can be bent easily to travel around {{obstacles}} {{in the path}} of the tubing. While the work hardening of the drawing process used to size the tubing makes the copper hard or rigid, it is carefully annealed to make it soft again; it is therefore more expensive to produce than non-annealed, rigid copper tubing. It can be joined by any of the three methods used for rigid copper, and it is the only type of copper tubing suitable for flare connections. Soft copper is the most popular choice for <b>refrigerant</b> <b>lines</b> in split-system air conditioners and heat pumps.|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} draft report titled ''Impacts of <b>Refrigerant</b> <b>Line</b> Length on System Efficiency in Residential Heating and Cooling Systems Using Refrigerant Distribution,'' (Andrews 2000) some {{baseline}} calculations {{were performed to}} estimate various impacts on system efficiency of long refrigerant distribution lines. Refrigerant distribution refers to ''mini-splits'' {{and other types of}} space beating and cooling equipment that utilize refrigerant lines, rather than ducts or pipes, to transport heat and cooling effect from the outdoor unit to the building spaces where this heat or cooling is used. Five factors affecting efficiency were studied in each of the space conditioning modes (heating and cooling) for a total of ten factors in all. Temperature changes and pressure drops in each of the two refrigerant lines accounted for four of the factors, with the remaining one being elevation of the indoor unit relative to the outdoor unit. Of these factors, pressure drops in the suction line in cooling showed by far the largest effect. This report builds on these baseline calculations to develop a possible algorithm for a refrigerant distribution section of ASHRAE Standard 152. It is based on the approximate treatment of the previous report, and is therefore subject to error that might be corrected using a more detailed analysis, possibly including computer modeling and field testing. However, because the calculated efficiency impacts are generally small (a few percent being typical) {{it may be that the}} approximate treatment is sufficient. That question is left open for discussion. The purpose of this report is not to advocate the adoption of the methodology developed, but rather to present it as an option that could either be adopted as-is or used as a starting point for further analysis. It is assumed that the reader has available and is familiar with ASHRAE Standard 152 P and with the previous analysis referred to above...|$|E
40|$|With {{increased}} {{concern about}} the impact of refrigerant leakage on global warming, a number of new supermarket refrigeration system configurations requiring significantly less refrigerant charge are being considered. In order to help promote the development of advanced systems and expand the knowledge base for energy-efficient supermarket technology, the International Energy Agency (IEA) established IEA Annex 26 (Advanced Supermarket Refrigeration/Heat Recovery Systems) under the ''IEA Implementing Agreement on Heat Pumping Technologies''. Annex 26 focuses on demonstrating and documenting the energy saving and environmental benefits of advanced systems design for food refrigeration and space heating and cooling for supermarkets. Advanced in this context means systems that use less energy, require less refrigerant and produce lower refrigerant emissions. Stated another way, the goal is to identify supermarket refrigeration and HVAC technology options that reduce the total equivalent warming impact (TEWI) of supermarkets by reducing both system energy use (increasing efficiency) and reducing total refrigerant charge. The Annex has five participating countries: Canada, Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The working program of the Annex has involved analytical and experimental investigation of several candidate system design approaches to determine their potential to reduce refrigerant usage and energy consumption. Advanced refrigeration system types investigated include the following: distributed compressor systems [...] small parallel compressor racks are located in close proximity to the food display cases they serve thus significantly shortening the connecting <b>refrigerant</b> <b>line</b> lengths; secondary loop systems [...] one or more central chillers are used to refrigerate a secondary coolant (e. g. brine, ice slurry, or CO 2) that is pumped to the food display cases on the sales floor; self-contained display cases [...] each food display case has its own refrigeration unit; low-charge direct expansion [...] similar to conventional multiplex refrigeration systems but with improved controls to limit charge. Means to integrate store HVAC systems for space heating/cooling with the refrigeration system have been investigated as well. One approach is to use heat pumps to recover refrigeration waste heat and raise it to a sufficient level to provide for store heating needs. Another involves use of combined heating and power (CHP) or combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems to integrate the refrigeration, HVAC, and power services in stores. Other methods including direct recovery of refrigeration reject heat for space and water heating have also been examined...|$|E
40|$|HCFC- 22 and HFC- 134 a {{were used}} with short tube {{orifices}} having length to diameter ratios ranging from 5 to 20 in a 9. 53 mm (3 / 8 in.) <b>refrigerant</b> <b>line</b> to investigate both two-phase and subcooled liquid flow entering the short tubes. Flow temperature and pressure conditions were those typically found in air-conditioner and heat pump applications. Effects of each operating parameters and short tube geometry on the flow rate were discussed and {{included in the}} modeling. Both an analytical and semi-empirical model were developed. These models allowed better prediction of mass flow rate and investigation of transport properties inside the short tube. Generally, the flow trends for both refrigerants were similar even though mass flow rate range for HFC- 134 a was 30 % lower than that for HCFC- 22 due to lower operating pressure conditions. Within normal heat pump or air-conditioner operating conditions, second-stage choking (choking at the outlet) was only approximated because the flow showed a small dependency on downstream pressure. For the conditions investigate, the mass flow rate was directly proportional to upstream pressure and upstream subcooling, but it showed only a small dependency on downstream pressure. For two-phase flow entering the short tube, the flow rate decreased with increasing quality. The mass flow rate {{was found to be}} dependent on cross sectional area, chamfer depth, and short tube length. For subcooled liquid entering the short tube, the delay of flashing, i. e. metastable liquid flow, was observed at the inlet section of the short tube. It was observed that the effects of oil concentration on mass flow rate varied as a function of short tube geometry and upstream subcooling or quality. The semi-empirical flow model and flow charts for both single and two-phase flow were developed by empirically correcting the modified single-phase orifice equation to satisfy the short tube orifice flow. For both HCFC- 22 and HFC- 134 a, the maximum difference between measured data and the model?s prediction was within ? 10 %. An analytical model was developed using the assumptions of homogeneous two-phase flow along a two-phase critical flow model. For two-phase entering the short tube, the calculated flow rate form the analytical model was within ? 6 % of the experimental data. However, for the high subcooling region, some deviation, as high as ? 11 % of the measured values, was observed due to the imperfection of a selected two-phase critical flow model...|$|E
50|$|Rotary-vane {{pumps are}} also a common type of vacuum pump, with {{two-stage}} pumps able to reach pressures well below 10−6 bar. These vacuum pumps are found in numerous applications, such as providing braking assistance in large trucks and diesel-powered passenger cars (whose engines do not generate intake vacuum) through a braking booster, in most light aircraft to drive gyroscopic flight instruments, in evacuating <b>refrigerant</b> <b>lines</b> during installation of air conditioners, in laboratory freeze dryers, and vacuum experiments in physics. In the vane pump, the pumped gas and the oil are mixed within the pump, and so they must be separated externally. Therefore, the inlet and the outlet have a large chamber, maybe with swirl, where the oil drops {{fall out of the}} gas. Sometimes the inlet has a venetian blind cooled by the room air (the pump is usually 40 K hotter) to condense cracked pumping oil and water, and let it drop back into the inlet. When these pumps are used in high-vacuum systems (where the inflow of gas into the pump becomes very low), a significant concern is contamination of the entire system by molecular oil backstreaming.|$|R

The cooling system consists of an engine-driven vapor-compression system assembled in a backpack configuration, coupled with a cooling garment containing <b>refrigerant</b> <b>lines</b> worn {{in close proximity to}} the skin. A 2. 0 L fuel tank in the backpack powers a small-scale engine that runs a compressor modified from the original air compression application to the refrigerant compression application here. A centrifugal clutch and reduction gear train system was designed and fabricated to couple the engine output to the refrigerant compressor and heat rejection fan. The overall cooling system, including the wearable evaporator, had a total mass of 5. 31 kg (11. 7 lb) and measured 0. 318 נ 0. 273 נ 0. 152 m (12. 5 נ 10. 75 נ 6 inches).

40|$|Abstract — Industrial {{energy audits}} {{generally}} focus on optimization of manufacturing process systems but fail {{to focus on}} the non-process industrial HVAC systems. This is in spite of well-documented widespread prevalence of efficiency degrading faults affecting these systems. This is probably because existing fault detection methods require time and extensive models that are not easily available to energy auditors on a one-day audit. Therefore the proposed automated fault detection and diagnostic device for unitary air conditioners uses quick temperature and pressure measurements, along with easily obtainable nameplate or brochure data, to detect refrigerant undercharge, <b>refrigerant</b> overcharge, liquid <b>line</b> restriction, condenser fouling and evaporator fouling faults. It also predicts the related energy and cost saving for each fault.

40|$|Industrial and {{military}} vehicles, including trucks, tanks and others, employ cooling systems that address passenger cooling and auxiliary cooling loads {{ranging from a}} few Watts to 50 kW or more. Such systems are typically powered using vapor-compression cooling systems that either directly supply cold air to the various locations, or cool an intermediate single-phase coolant closed loop, which in turn serves as the coolant for the passenger cabins and auxiliary loads such as electronics modules. Efforts are underway to enhance the performance of such systems, and also to develop more light weight and compact systems that would remove high heat fluxes. The distributed cooling configuration offers {{the advantage of a}} smaller refrigerant system package. The heat transfer between the intermediate fluid and air or with the auxiliary heat loads can be fine tuned through the control of flow rates and component sizes and controls to maintain tight tolerances on the cooling performance. Because of the additional loop involved in such a configuration, there is a temperature penalty between the refrigerant and the ultimate heat sink or source, but in some configurations, this may be counteracted through judicious design of the phase change-to-liquid coupled heat exchangers. Such heat exchangers are inherently smaller due to the high heat transfer coefficients in phase change and single-phase liquid flow compared to air flow. The additional loop also requires a pump to circulate the fluid, which adds pumping power requirements. However, a direct refrigerant-to-heat load coupling system might in fact be suboptimal if the heat loads are distributed across large distances. This is because of the significantly higher pressure drops (and saturation temperature drops) incurred in transporting vapor or two-phase fluids through <b>refrigerant</b> <b>lines</b> across long plumbing elements. An optimal system can be developed for any candidate application by assessing the tradeoffs in cooling capacity, heat exchanger sizes and configurations, and compression, pumping and fan power. In this study, a versatile simulation platform {{for a wide variety of}} direct and indirectly coupled cooling systems was developed to enable comparison of different component geometries and system configurations based on operating requirements and applicable design constraints. Components are modeled at increasing levels of complexity ranging from specified closest approach temperatures for key components to models based on detailed heat transfer and pressure drop models. These components of varying complexity can be incorporated into the system model as desired and trade-off analyses on system configurations performed. Employing this platform as a screening, comparison, and optimization tool, a number of conventional vapor-compression and distributed cooling systems were analyzed to determine the efficacy of the distributed cooling scheme in mobile cooling applications. Four systems serving approximately a 6 kW cooling duty, two with air-coupled evaporators and two with liquid-coupled evaporators, were analyzed for ambient conditions of 37. 78 °C and 40 % relative humidity. Though the condensers and evaporators are smaller in liquid-coupled systems, the total mass of the heat exchangers in the liquid-coupled systems is larger due to the additional air-to-liquid heat exchangers that the configuration requires. Additionally, for the cooling applications considered, the additional compressor power necessitated by the liquid-coupled configuration and the additional power consumed by the liquid-loop pumps result in the coefficient of performance being lower for liquid-coupled systems than for air-coupled systems. However, the use of liquid-coupling in a system does meet the primary goal of decreasing the system refrigerant inventory by enabling the use of smaller condensers and evaporators and by eliminating long refrigerant carrying hoses.

40|$|The {{refrigerant}} circuits of car {{air-conditioning systems}} are fitted with so-called open type compressors, {{because there is}} only a lip seal preventing the refrigerant from leaking from the compressor housing to the atmosphere. In addition, the cycle uses damping elements between the compressor and the other components on the suction and pressure lines to reduce vibration and noise transfer from the engine to the car body. Both the lip seal and damping elements result in loss of refrigerant as they are made from elastomers and leak with age, and, under high temperature conditions inside the engine room, these elements also allow a relatively high permeation of the refrigerant gas to the atmosphere. With very high refrigerant losses in the older R 12 -cooling cycles and the damage caused by this gas to the ozone layer in the stratosphere, the Montreal protocol phased out this refrigerant and the car industry was forced to revert completely to R 134 a until 1994 / 95. R 134 a has no ozone depletion potential, but it has a direct global warming potential, and, therefore, leakages also have to be minimised. R 134 a has, because of its molecular size, a high permeation potential and, hence, all the <b>refrigerant</b> hoses are <b>lined</b> internally. Unfortunately, these hoses also leak with age and significant refrigerant loss will occur [1] R 134 a can therefore only be viewed as a solution until an alternative refrigerant with no direct global warming potential has been developed. Candidates for new refrigerants are natural substances such as hydrocarbons or carbon dioxide [2]. Unfortunately, both substances have disadvantages and their use is restricted to special cases, for e. g. hydrocarbons are flammable and are not used in car air-conditioners, but in Germany it is used as a refrigerant in household refrigerators with hermetic cycles.

These include an investigation of a novel jet-pump design methodology, (the Constant Rate of Momentum Change method), the application of CFD in the design of jet-pumps, the experimental testing of two new refrigerant fluids and finally, a comparative experimental investigation of performance benefits resulting from two cycle improvements that had not been tested before - these are the introduction of (i) a pre-heater (or recuperator) between the jet-pump and condenser, to preheat the liquid flow to the vapour generator, and (ii) a pre-cooler (or economiser) in the suction line between the evaporator and jet-pump, in order to sub-cool the liquid <b>refrigerant</b> in the <b>line</b> between the condenser and evaporator. Literature studies of jet-pump refrigerator technology and jet-pump design methodology are reviewed and discussed. A CFD model has been developed, assessed and validated against given experimental data. Simulations of a jet-pump that is part of a jet-pump refrigerator cycle was carried out to investigate the refrigerant flow structure and to assess the dominant influence of operating conditions and geometry. The validated CFD code was then used to optimize the design of the jet-pump for two new refrigerants (R 236 fa and R 245 fa). The resulting optimized jet-pumps were manufactured and tested experimentally over a wide range of operating conditions, using an adaptable test rig that was purpose-developed as part of this research work. Detailed experimental studies were carried out. All the experimentally determined results were compared to the CFD predicted values, and these showed good agreement for all the jet-pumps tested.

40|$|R 290 is a {{potential}} refrigerant replacing R 22 because of its zero Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) and virtually zero Global Warming Potential (GWP). However, R 290 is flammable and requires excellent containment to avoid leakage and {{reduce the risk of}} fire. The use of small diameter copper tube (5 mm or even smaller) is an effective way to reduce refrigerant charge and thus reduce the risk of fire {{in the event of a}} refrigerant leak. However, employing small diameter copper tube will increase pressure drop and consequently reduce system performance. A suction line heat exchanger which employs the low temperature <b>refrigerant</b> in suction <b>line</b> to cool down the refrigerant before expansion value is {{a potential}} solution to improve system performance because R 290 has low discharge temperature compared with HFC refrigerants (e. g. R 22, R 410 A). This paper presents an investigation of application of a suction line heat exchanger in an R 290 air conditioner with small diameter copper tube. A theoretical analysis is proposed at first to investigate the effect of the suction line heat exchanger on capacity and system energy efficiency under variable evaporating and cooling temperatures. A prototype R 290 air conditioner with and without a suction line heat exchanger is tested in order to explore the effect of a suction line heat exchanger on system performance and refrigerant charge in real working conditions. Finally, a refrigerant circuit solution for heat pump air conditioners is proposed. The results of theoretical analysis indicate that the capacity and system energy efficiency increase linearly with the heat exchange of the suctionline heat exchanger, and the suction line heat exchanger can improves capacity by up to 12 % and system energy efficiency by up to 4 % under both cooling and heating modes. This is because the suction line heat exchanger increases the sub-cooling but has less impact on compressor power due to good thermal properties of R 290. Further, the evaporating and condensation temperature have insignificant impact on the performance of suction line heat exchanger. The experimental results show that the suction line heat exchanger improves the cooling capacity and system efficiency by 5. 3 % and 4. 5 %, respectively. These results agree well with that of the system analysis. The sub-cooling temperature increases 10. 2 o C and the discharge temperature increases 25. 4 o C. Further, the suction line heat exchanger reduces the refrigerant charge by as much as 6 %. This is because suction line heat exchanger increases the discharge temperature, and thus the superheat region of the condenser increases resulting in less refrigerant in the condenser. Overall, the use of a suction line heat exchanger in a system with small diameter copper tube improves the performance of R 290 and more importantly reduces the refrigerant charge...|$|R
