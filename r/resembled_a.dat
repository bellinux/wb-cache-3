5|$|H. erectus {{arrived in}} Eurasia {{approximately}} 1.8 million years ago, in an event {{considered to be}} the first African exodus. There is evidence that the Java population of H. erectus lived in an ever-wet forest habitat. More specifically the environment <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> savannah, but was likely regularly inundated ("hydromorphic savanna"). The plants found at the Trinil excavation site included grass (Poaceae), ferns, Ficus, and Indigofera, which are typical of lowland rainforest.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{uses the}} {{technique}} of pixilation and shows a man's hands (the hands are PES's) making guacamole out of familiar objects, which become different items whenever they are cut, often depending on (unspoken) puns. For example, a baseball is cut in half and then becomes a pile of dice while it is being diced. Each of the objects also <b>resembles</b> <b>an</b> ingredient actually used in an authentic guacamole recipe - a grenade with a billiard ball pit <b>resembles</b> <b>an</b> avocado, <b>a</b> baseball <b>resembles</b> <b>an</b> onion, <b>a</b> pincushion <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> tomato, a green miniature golf ball (with an interior of Trivial Pursuit game pieces/wedges) <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> lime, a green Christmas light bulb <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> jalapeño pepper, and king and queen chess pieces resemble salt & pepper shakers. The end result is [...] "fresh guacamole" [...] served with a side of poker [...] "chips".|$|R

5|$|On June 27, 2006, OCD International {{released}} One-Watt Sun's material {{under the}} title The Return of Dr. Octagon in the United States on compact disc, although the completed work more closely <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> remix album than what Thornton had originally intended. In the United Kingdom, the CMH-completed album was released by Buttercuts Records on compact disc and vinyl.|$|E
5|$|The {{action was}} {{illuminated}} in brief, blinding flashes by Jap searchlights which were shot {{out as soon}} as they were turned on, by muzzle flashes from big guns, by fantastic streams of tracers, and by huge orange-colored explosions as two Jap destroyers and one of our destroyers blew up... From the beach it <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> door to hell opening and closing... over and over.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} aberrations. The 1992 kit, {{sponsored}} by Triton Showers, {{was made of}} a blue material covered with multicoloured splashes which <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> shower curtain. Birmingham have only worn stripes on their home shirt once; in 1999 they wore a blue shirt with a front central panel in narrow blue and white stripes, a design similar to the Tesco supermarket carrier bag of the time.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on July 1. It steadily organized as it moved westward, and <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression by July 7. However, surface reports and reconnaissance aircraft indicated the system did not have tropical characteristics, and remained simply a low-pressure system. The wave produced tropical storm-force winds as it moved through the Lesser Antilles on July 8, but did not acquire tropical characteristics until it reached the eastern Caribbean. Because it had tropical storm-force winds, the system was upgraded immediately to Tropical Storm Claudette after it developed a low-level circulation later on July 8.|$|E
5|$|An {{experiment}} by the Australian zoologist A.D. Blest {{demonstrated that}} the more an eyespot <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> real vertebrate eye in both colour and pattern, the more effective it was in scaring off insectivorous birds. In another experiment using peacock butterflies, Blest showed that when the conspicuous eyespots had been rubbed off, insectivorous birds (yellow buntings) were much less effectively frightened off, and therefore both the sudden appearance of colour, and the actual eyespot pattern, contribute {{to the effectiveness of}} the deimatic display.|$|E

5|$|Anomalocaridids, such as Anomalocaris, were {{organism}}s {{thought to}} be distantly related to the arthropods. These creatures looked quite unlike any organism living today—they had segmented exoskeletons, with lateral lobes used for swimming, typically large compound eyes, often set on stalks, and most strikingly, a pair of large, claw-like great appendages that resembled headless shrimp. These appendages {{are thought to have}} passed food to the animal's mouth, which <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> ring of sliced pineapple.|$|E
5|$|Early European explorers in North America, {{who were}} {{familiar}} with the smaller red deer of Europe, thought that the larger North American animal <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> moose, and consequently gave it the name elk, which is the common European name for moose. The word elk is related to the Latin alces, Old Norse elgr, Scandinavian elg/älg and German Elch, all of which refer to the animal known in North America as the moose.|$|E
5|$|Green {{ran into}} {{problems}} with Go Man Go's registration. At that time, the AQHA had {{two types of}} registration, the Appendix and the Tentative. Appendix-registered horses were the offspring of Thoroughbreds and either Tentative-registered Quarter Horses or Appendix-registered Quarter Horses. Go Man Go was originally registered in the Appendix, as his dam was an Appendix-registered mare. The way to advance out of the Appendix into the Tentative registry was to qualify on performance grounds and pass a conformation examination conducted by the AQHA. Go Man Go certainly qualified under the performance criteria, but his conformation was such that he <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> Thoroughbred more than he <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> Quarter Horse. Green knew {{that in order to}} increase his stud fees—the price paid for the right to breed a mare to a stallion—Go Man Go needed to acquire a regular registration number instead of his Appendix number. So Green appealed to the Executive Committee of the AQHA, which had the authority to award Tentative numbers to horses regardless of conformation exam results. In both 1956 and 1957, the committee declined to take action, waiting to evaluate the quality of Go Man Go's first foals before making a decision. Finally, in 1958, they awarded Go Man Go number 82,000 in the Tentative registry.|$|E

5|$|Jean-Louis Cormier, who {{was given}} the ring name Rudy Kay because he <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> retired wrestler who had used the same name, {{spent much of his}} career {{balancing}} his roles as promoter and wrestler. He helped found the ESA in 1969 and operated shows under the title International Wrestling (IW). He won five tag team championships while teaming with The Beast and held two titles as a singles wrestler. He retired from active competition in 1982 and died of septicemia on May 25, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Nevada was refloated on 12 February 1942 and {{underwent}} temporary repairs at Pearl Harbor so {{she could}} get to Puget Sound Navy Yard for a major overhaul and modernization. This was completed in October 1942, and it changed the old battleship's appearance so she slightly <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> South Dakota from a distance. Her 5"/51s and 5"/25s were replaced with sixteen 5"/38 caliber guns in new twin mounts. Nevada then sailed for Alaska, where she provided fire support from 11–18 May 1943 for the capture of Attu.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 2007, Chris Taylor, {{mounted on}} a {{pantomime}} horse, confronted police officers, who were on foot, and {{asked them if they}} needed any reinforcements against APEC protesters. When his offer was refused, Taylor took the horse for a stroll anyway, and was met by amused onlookers and media personnel. He was later asked by police officers to remove his clothing for examination, since it <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> police uniform; but no charges of impersonating police were laid. The reference was to the horse flu outbreak, which forced police officers to face APEC protesters on foot. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.|$|E

5|$|The Eco Beach {{tourist resort}} was only built to resist wind gusts of Category3 strength. Only about 10 of the 40 {{accommodation}} huts were left standing. Some of the huts {{were removed from}} their concrete foundations, and were carried by the winds and smashed into other buildings. Showing how strong Rosita's winds were, a sea container weighing 2.5 tonnes (5500 lb) and filled with 2 to 3 tonnes (4400 to 6600lb) of equipment was blown 700m (0.4mile) across sand dunes. The magnitude of the devastation to the vegetation in this area <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> place being destroyed by bushfires.|$|E
5|$|The NHC {{introduced}} {{the system in}} its tropical weather outlook on November28, {{with the possibility of}} subtropical or tropical development noted. It moved slowly westward, becoming better organized, and by late that day <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> subtropical cyclone; however, as it was still connected to the cold front, it could not have been classified as such. Early on November29, an area of deep convection developed and organized over the surface center when it was about 915mi (1470km) east of Bermuda. The NHC accordingly assessed the system as developing into a tropical storm, designating it with the Greek letter Epsilon.|$|E
5|$|The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band (WCPAEB) was an American {{psychedelic}} {{rock band}} formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965. The group created music that possessed an eerie, {{and at times}} sinister, atmosphere, and contained material that was bluntly political, childlike, and bizarre. Representing different musical backgrounds among band members, the group, at times, <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> traditional Byrds-esque folk rock ensemble, but the WCPAEB also, within the same body of work, recorded avant-garde music marked by multi-layered vocal harmonies.|$|E
