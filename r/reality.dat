500|$|A second {{influence}} on Durkheim's view of society beyond Comte's positivism was the epistemological outlook called social realism. Although he never explicitly exposed it, Durkheim adopted a realist perspective {{in order to}} demonstrate the existence of social <b>realities</b> outside the individual and to show that these <b>realities</b> existed {{in the form of}} the objective relations of society. As an epistemology of science, realism can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social <b>realities</b> exist in the outer world and that these <b>realities</b> are independent of the individual's perception of them. This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as empiricism and positivism. Empiricists such as David Hume had argued that all <b>realities</b> in the outside world are products of human sense perception. According to empiricists, all <b>realities</b> are thus merely perceived: they do not exist independently of our perceptions, and have no causal power in themselves. Comte's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations. Going beyond this, Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover [...] "apparent" [...] laws, but would be able to discover the inherent nature of society.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate virtual <b>realities</b> as motivational tools during robotic assisted gait training with children in the pediatric Lokomat®. Nine children with different gait disorders and eight healthy children participated in the study. Muscular effort of the lower leg was assessed by surface electromyography during a randomly designed training protocol with virtual <b>realities.</b> Self reported motivation was investigated with two questionnaires. Comparisons were drawn through repeated measurement Analysis of Variance and paired-t-tests. The logarithmic transformed data showed that the electromyographic activity output in both groups was significantly higher during tasks with virtual <b>realities</b> than during normal walking conditions. These results support that virtual <b>realities</b> seem to be efficient motivational tools to increase children's muscular effort in the pediatric Lokomat®. The gaming aspect of virtual <b>realities</b> keeps children highly engaged during repetitive tasks...|$|R
