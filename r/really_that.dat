5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't <b>really</b> <b>that</b> I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E

500|$|After the game, Brandon Graham, {{who played}} with Robinson at Michigan in 2009 and also played with Michael Vick on the Philadelphia Eagles told reporters that Robinson is even quicker than Vick: [...] "Both of them are pretty fast, I just think Vick's older; he's not <b>really</b> <b>that</b> fast like how Shoelace is. I think Shoelace is more quick than Vick, but Vick, he gets away. He's pretty fast still. I think Shoelace might have got him by a couple steps." ...|$|E
500|$|Only Hearts {{founder and}} head {{designer}} Helena Stuart commented, [...] "She {{was the first}} one that was <b>really</b> <b>that</b> big. Without the bra, it wouldn't have worked.

[...] It has been claimed that her bosom was a major force behind the development of the 1950s brassieres, including the [...] "Whirlpool bra", Cuties, the [...] "Shutter bra", the [...] "Action bra", latex pads, cleavage revealing designs and uplift outline.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the band}} {{have since been}} dismissive and {{critical}} of the work. Recalling the album in later years, Waters said: [...] "Ummagumma – what a disaster!", while in 1995, Gilmour described the album as [...] "horrible". In a 1984 interview, Mason said: [...] "I {{thought it was a}} very good and interesting little exercise, the whole business of everyone doing a bit. But I still feel <b>really</b> <b>that</b> that's quite a good example of the sum being greater than the parts..." [...] Later, he described it as [...] "a failed experiment", adding that [...] "the most significant thing is that we didn't do it again".|$|E

500|$|The storyline {{contains}} minor {{scenes from}} Crichton's Jurassic Park and The Lost World novels that were ultimately not {{featured in the}} film versions, such as the Pteranodon aviary {{and the use of}} the boat. Laura Dern's cameo was shot in a day. In an earlier draft, Neill and Dern's characters were a couple in the process of splitting up. Johnston said, [...] "I didn't want to see them as a couple anymore. For one thing, I don't think they look like a couple. It would be uncomfortable to still see them together. And Laura Dern doesn't look like she's aged for the past fifteen years!" [...] The film's longest rough cut was approximately 96 minutes, without credits. According to Johnston, [...] "We lost maybe 8 minutes, so it was never <b>really</b> <b>that</b> long." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Telegraph called Agnew and Murphy's effort, [...] "new {{heights of}} ingenuity". Agnew's {{reaction}} to the event was, [...] "It's {{a sad day for}} everyone involved in English cricket. Is it <b>really</b> <b>that</b> cricket is getting so greedy that everyone who wants to come and report on the game {{for the good of the}} game is going to have to be charged for it?" [...] However, he remained upbeat about the situation: [...] "Actually I get rather more of a panoramic view of it from up here than I did yesterday in my commentary box. There's a little road that runs round the back of the ground. All manner of people are trundling up and down – buses, bikes and little three wheeled tuk-tuks – it's rather fun." ...|$|E
500|$|However, reviews {{were not}} uniformly positive. Tim Teeman posed the {{question}} in The Times: [...] "I know she's a national institution and June Brown plays her like a dream, but was last night's Dot Cotton extravaganza <b>really</b> <b>that</b> great? Or even necessary?" [...] Teeman opined that: [...] "Quite rightly, the producers want to eke as much gold out of the character and actress as possible: both are fantastic. But this was much-loved character overkill." [...] He noted that Jordan's script worked best as Dot remembered Ethel, but assessed that the episode was overly indulgent, and did not reveal anything [...] "substantially new" [...] about Dot. As with Banks-Smith's review, Teeman felt that the episode was incompatible with Dot's former characterisation, suggesting that her Christian faith ought to have tempered her decision not to care for Jim. He felt that overall, the episode was somewhat dull and boring, describing Dot as an EastEnders [...] "jewel" [...] who should be cherished, not turned into a [...] "drag act".|$|E

500|$|By contrast, the ESRB {{has only}} officially issued the AO rating for extreme {{violence}} three times: Thrill Kill, a fighting game with heavy sexual overtones, received an AO rating with content descriptors for [...] "Animated Violence" [...] and [...] "Animated Blood and Gore". Thrill Kill was cancelled by Electronic Arts after it acquired the game's publisher, Virgin Interactive, due to objections over the game's content. Manhunt 2 also received an AO rating for its extreme violence; while the uncut version {{would be released}} exclusively for PCs, the console versions were edited to meet the M rating criteria. In January 2015, Hatred, a controversial game whose plot centers around a character indiscriminately murdering everyone he encounters, received the rating for its extreme violence and harsh language; one of the game's developers disputed the rating, arguing that [...] "its violence isn't <b>really</b> <b>that</b> bad and this harsh language isn't overused", but also acknowledged the rarity of their situation.|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{single-hander}} {{episode of}} EastEnders received much critical acclaim. The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith deemed Brown possibly {{the only member}} of the cast with the exception of Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell) capable of carrying such a monologue. Robert Hanks for The Independent wrote that [...] "I don't ever remember hearing anybody on a soap talk like this before. I mean, like a real person, with real feelings, such as self-pity and a desperate urge for self-preservation. Brown conveyed the seedy gloom of it all beautifully, as well." [...] Conversely, Tim Teeman posed the question in The Times: [...] "I know she’s a national institution and June Brown plays her like a dream, but was last night’s Dot Cotton extravaganza <b>really</b> <b>that</b> great? Or even necessary?" [...] Teeman opined that: [...] "Quite rightly, the producers want to eke as much gold out of the character and actress as possible: both are fantastic. But this was much-loved character overkill." [...] He deemed Dot a [...] "soap icon", however he also assessed that: ...|$|E
500|$|In a DVD {{review of}} the first season, Jason Bovberg of the DVD Talk was {{disappointed}} on the set, saying [...] "Where is it? This is perhaps the only disappointment of the set. I was a little aggravated by the loooong animated menus that introduce all the characters, one by one, but it's <b>really</b> <b>that</b> missing episode that has me upset." [...] Bovberg described the set as [...] "annoying" [...] for missing the episode. Bill Treadway of the DVD Verdict, on {{the exclusion of the}} episode on the DVD, said [...] "It's a small flaw in an otherwise top notch package." [...] In a DVD {{review of the}} third season, Bryan Pope of the DVD Verdict, on the episode as a bonus feature, said [...] "The most intriguing extra is the series' pilot episode, 'Help Wanted'." [...] He asked in his review [...] "Why release it now instead of in its natural spot with the first season?" [...] At the end, he said [...] "Regardless, SpongeBob completists will cherish its inclusion here." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{expressed}} mixed {{opinions of}} the game's audio. The D-Pad Destroyer of GamePro said that the [...] "whimsical" [...] background music is [...] "quite enjoyable" [...] and the character sound bites are [...] "varied enough to avoid becoming annoying." [...] Doug Perry of IGN had a more mixed take, saying that the [...] "classic bouncy, xylophone-heavy beat" [...] is [...] "not necessarily great", and that after a few courses, [...] "you either stop hearing it, or the incessant simplicity of it {{makes you want to}} cry or pull your hair out". On the subject of the voice acting, he concluded that there is [...] "nothing <b>really</b> <b>that</b> cute, clever or memorable" [...] in the game, and noted that Crash's voice in the game is extremely similar to that of Luigi from the Mario Kart series. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote that while the music and sound effects [...] "push the game's cartoon theme," [...] the themes were not too [...] "over the top" [...] or incessant. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution passed the music off as [...] "standard kitschy fare" [...] and added that while the sound effects [...] "add to the cartoon quality of the game", some of the character voices were unsatisfactory. Joe Ottoson of Allgame noted that the characters [...] "are all quite vocal", and the music [...] "sets off the whimsical mood nicely".|$|E
500|$|John Anderson of Newsday wrote [...] "The kind {{of movie}} that will {{entertain}} everyone of every age and probably for ages to come." [...] John Zebrowski of The Seattle Times gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "The movie is helped immensely by its cast, who carry it through some of the early, sluggish scenes. But this is Murphy's movie. Donkey gets most of the good lines, and Murphy hits every one." [...] Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote [...] "In an era when much on film seems old, Shrek seems new and fresh and clever." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post gave the film five out of five stars, saying [...] "Despite all its high-tech weirdness, it is <b>really</b> <b>that</b> most perdurable of human constructions, a tale told well and true." [...] Joe Baltake of The Sacramento Bee wrote that it [...] "isn't so much a fractured spoof of everything Disney, but actually a Monty Python flick for kids – kids of all ages". Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer wrote [...] "What gives Shrek its special artistic distinction is its witty and knowingly sassy dialogue, delivered by vocally charismatic performers whose voices remind us of their stellar screen personae in live-action movies." [...] Lisa Alspector of the Chicago Reader wrote [...] "This romantic fantasy complicates the roles of beauty and beast, making it hard to guess what form a sensitive resolution will take." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote [...] "The charms of Shrek, which is based on the children's book by William Steig, go far beyond in-jokes for adults." ...|$|E
500|$|A second safety car {{period was}} caused on lap 37 {{by a man}} walking on the track. Several drivers again used the safety car to pit for new tyres, {{including}} Jenson Button, who emerged in tenth place. By lap 40, Alexander Rossi was instructed to unlap himself behind the safety car, but when he {{failed to do so}} in an acceptable time, the race was resumed on lap 41, with Rossi stuck between the front runners. By lap 42, Button was racing Pastor Maldonado for position, when both collided in turn 15, damaging Button's front wing, who was forced to pit to have it exchanged. Button rejoined in 14th place, telling his team on the radio [...] "I should have known, <b>really,</b> <b>that</b> he's mental", speaking about Maldonado. By lap 45, Max Verstappen, who had started more than a lap behind, was up to ninth and set the new fastest lap of the race. One lap later, he took eighth place from Grosjean. His teammate Sainz followed two laps later, with Grosjean complaining that Sainz had left him [...] "nowhere to go". Meanwhile, at the front, Ricciardo set a fastest lap on lap 51, being 2.9 seconds behind leading man Vettel. Lap 53 saw Jenson Button become the second McLaren to retire, suffering from a gearbox issue as well. During the closing stages of the race, Valtteri Bottas in fifth experienced gearbox problems of his own, but was able to continue. On lap 60, Grosjean ran wide and let Felipe Nasr move through into the final point scoring position, tenth. During the last lap, Toro Rosso instructed Verstappen to let his teammate Sainz pass him for eighth, but Verstappen refused and stayed in place. Sebastian Vettel crossed the line to win the race, which took the entire allowed span of two hours.|$|E
