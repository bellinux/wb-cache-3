40|$|AbstractPistons of IC {{engines are}} {{typically}} subjected during operation to {{high cycle fatigue}} loading cycles at high temperatures (up to 350 °C) in areas facing the combustion chamber. During operation the high temperature exposure results in a progressive loss of fatigue strength of the material at the weakest areas of the piston and may eventually results in a premature failure by crack initiation and propagation. The quantification of the temperature effect on fatigue strength inevitably require experimentation since such data are scarce. An extensive fatigue testing program of eutectic Al-Si alloys at room temperature and at several high temperatures (250 °C, 300 °C and 350 °C) is reported. Specimens were extracted from piston crowns and tested in a <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> machine. The resulting fatigue strength loss at 107 cycles is quantified by a staircase approach. The influence of the test temperature is investigated in terms of chemical composition, process route and of mechanisms of fracture observed in the broken specimens...|$|E
40|$|Rotating bending {{tests have}} been, up to now, {{typically}} {{used for the}} determination of S/N curves. In this paper, a method is proposed that allows {{the determination of the}} fatigue limit curve and the crack growth curve by means of such rotating bending tests. For this purpose, flaws of controlled shape and size are introduced on the surface of conventional round bar specimens. The <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> rig is equipped with additional hardware for optical crack length measurement. The stress at incipient crack growth gives a point in the fatigue limit (Kitagawa-Takahashi) diagram. After the crack starts to grow, photomicrographs are taken in regular intervals in order to obtain the crack growth curve. – The fatigue limit and crack growth curves obtained from the rotating bending tests are compared with results from conventional single edge notch bending specimens. Agreement is good, with the results from the rotating bending experiments lying somewhat on the conservative side. Some factors which may contribute to these differences are the different type of loading and the simplified calculation of the stress intensity factor in the rotating bending tests. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{design property}} of steel is the fatigue limit, i. e. the load level where a specimen has infinite life. For the material {{it can also}} be defined an endurance limit, which is the stress level at which the specimen has a certain life. It will not break before n o cycles. Obviously it is of interest to estimate these limits. The maximum inclusion size in clean steels influences the fatigue limit behaviour. Therefore it is also interesting to estimate the distribution of the inclusion size which causes the failure. Here the results from staircase tests are used to estimate the fatigue limit, the endurance limit and the inclusion size distribution. By combining the fatigue limit and the finite life distribution the whole S-N curve can be estimated at the same time. The uncertainties in the estimated parameters are taken into account by using the method of information matrix or the method of profile predictive likelihood. The staircase test is combined with the √(area_max) -model to estimate the distribution of the inclusion size where the failure occurs. This can be done by using stress levels with or without inclusion measurements. By combining the √(area_max) -model and the assumption that the inclusion size above a fixed threshold follows a generalized Pareto distribution, the stresses from the staircase test can be used to estimate the probability that a component will fail. Under these assumptions the probability that the component will fail under a <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> can be estimated using data from a uniaxial test on a different component and vice versa...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, it is {{investigated}} if the Barkhausen noise can {{be detected}} in a rotating environment using a new, passive sensor design. The sensor relies on the relative movement between the measured material and the sensor to function. The idea behind the thesis is to investigate if this sensor can detect changes in the Barkhausen noise measured on a ferromagnetic material as it is being subjected to stress until the point of breakage, and if this change {{can be related to}} fatigue in the material. If this is the case, the sensor-technology could be valuable for e. g. condition monitoring purposes. The work was focused on improving the design of an existing sensor, to build an accompanying measurement system - composed of the sensor, an amplifier, a data acquisition box and a computer - and to provide a proof of concept that the sensor can detect the Barkhausen noise. The sensor in its most basic form consist of a solenoid coil, with or without a core, and a permanent magnet. A number of different sensor versions were made and tested, to investigate the effects of the following parameters: the thread size in the coil, the core material, and the number of magnets and their orientation. To test the functionality of the sensor design, a <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> rig (RotaBend by Sincotec) was used. This machine also allow to expose the specimen to stress, to investigate if a change related to fatigue {{can be detected}}. MATLAB were used as an interface to the data acquisition box, to acquire and analyse data from the measurements using the sensor. The analysis were performed by calculating the RMS-voltage and the Fourier transform of the data. The thesis shows that the sensor can detect the Barkhausen noise in a rotating element. The limited amount of tests also indicates {{that it is possible to}} detect a change in the Barkhausen noise RMS-value as the material of the specimen is fatigued. It has not yet been proven if or how this change can be related to fatigue in the material. The tests also indicates that there is no change in the frequency content of the Barkhausen noise as the material of the specimen is fatigued.

40|$|Purpose: In {{order to}} achieve better {{performance}} and quality, the wheel design and manufacturing use a number of wheel tests (<b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test,</b> radial fatigue test, and impact test) {{to insure that the}} wheel meets the safety requirements. The test is very time consuming and expensive. Computer simulation of these tests can significantly reduce the time and cost required to perform a wheel design. In this study, nonlinear dynamic finite element is used to simulate the SAE wheel impact test. Design/methodology/approach: The test fixture used for the impact test consists of a striker with specified weight. The test is intended to simulate actual vehicle impact conditions. The tire-wheel assembly is mounted at 13 ° angle to the vertical plane with the edge of the weight in line with outer radius of the rim. The striker is dropped from a specified height above the highest point of the tire-wheel assembly and contacts the outboard flange of the wheel. Because of the irregular geometry of the wheel, the finite element model of an aluminium wheel is constructed by tetrahedral element. A mesh convergence study is carried out to ensure the convergence of the mesh model. The striker is assumed to be rigid elements. Initially, the striker contacts the highest area of the wheel, and the initial velocity of the striker is calculated from the impact height. The simulated strains at two locations on the disc are verified by experimental measurements by strain gages. The damage parameter of a wheel during the impact test is a strain energy density from the calculated result. Findings: The prediction of a wheel failure at impact is based on the condition that fracture will occur if the maximum strain energy density of the wheel during the impact test exceeds the total plastic work of the wheel material from tensile test. The simulated results in this work show that the total plastic work can be effectively employed as a fracture criterion to predict a wheel fracture of forged aluminum wheel during impact test. Research limitations/implications: A standard impact load is used to carry out the test. For future study, a heavier striker or higher impact can be used to perform the test in order to produce the rupture at impact. Originality/value: In this study, the nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis is performed to simulate a forged aluminium wheel during SAE impact test. The structural damage parameter of the wheel is estimated by the strain energy density, and the fracture criterion is based on the total plastic work of the wheel material. Computer simulation of wheel impact test can significantly reduce the time and cost required to finalize a wheel design...|$|E
40|$|The {{characterization}} of material fatigue behaviour {{is crucial in}} the design of mechanical components. Magnesium alloys, particularly wrought magnesium alloys, {{are one of the most}} interesting materials for mechanical components due to their superior physical and mechanical properties and have, therefore, been studied extensively. Primarily, evaluations of the fatigue characteristics of wrought magnesium alloys have been conducted under cyclic stress- and strain-control conditions. However, many engineering components are subjected to cyclic bending moments or load-control cyclic conditions. These conditions can be provided by a <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> (RBT), which is usually employed to extract stress versus number of cycles until failure of the sample (S-N curve). On the other hand, the S-N curve is not sufficient to evaluate cyclic deformations of the material, especially for low-cycle fatigue regimes. To estimate the fatigue behaviour of the material, it is necessary to obtain stress and strain responses of the material under different range of bending moments in load-control condition. To date, however, the evolution of hysteresis curves during rotating bending experiments for asymmetric materials such as magnesium alloys has not been reported in the literature. In the present study, for the first time, Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors were employed to measure the strain on AZ 31 B extrusion samples during RBT. First, the accuracy of strain measurement by the FBG sensor in the elastic and plastic regimes was investigated by comparing the FBG measured strain with that obtained by a standard extensometer during uniaxial pull-push test. Results confirmed that the FBG sensor was able to measure the strain up to 1. 3 %, accurately. In the next step, the strains of the specimens were measured under different bending moments of 2. 5, 5, 6. 5 Nm, during RBT. Based on these experiments, the strain amplitude of the samples was decreased with increasing the number of cycles in plastic regime until the sample was stabilized, however the strain response of the material under bending moment of 2. 5 (in elastic regime) remained constant during the test. To analyze applied stresses to the sample, particularly in the plastic deformation range, the proposed Variable Material Property (VMP) method was employed. In this model, the RBT was simulated by a fixed beam problem that was under alternative loading, and the stress-strain responses of the sample were predicted. Using this simulation method, the hysteresis loops of two critical top and bottom elements of the sample cross-section under different bending moments were obtained. Finally, the strain of the sample during rotating bending, which was measured by the embedded FBG sensor, was replaced with the strains obtained from the modeling by fitting a mapping function. The hysteresis obtained from combination of the modeling results and FBG experiments was relatively precise. To verify this claim, the stresses of the hysteresis loops were compared with the stresses obtained from the proposed strain-control pull-push tests in which, the strain on the sample was adjusted to be equal to the strain measured by the FBG sensor. The results of this test demonstrated that the stresses of the combined VMP and FBG hysteresis loops have good compatibility with the stress responses of the experiment. Therefore, the accuracy of the cyclic deformation hysteresis obtained using modeling and experimental results were confirmed under load-control conditions. Moreover, the fatigue life of the sample was calculated using the obtained hysteresis curve based on the energy approach. The predicted fatigue life of the AZ 31 B extrusion samples was in good agreement with published experimental data...|$|E

Previous high-cycle-fatigue (HCF) tests have outlined the negative influence of increasing “risk volumes” due to enlargement of the specimen size. Additional to the effect of “risk volumes” the influence of stress gradient may not be neglected as the gradient changes as well due to the enlargement of the specimen size.

The improvement on the fatigue performance is mainly because the fatigue crack initiation and the early stage of fatigue crack growth at the coating layer can be delayed after PEO coating with pore sealing. Therefore, it is a so-called synergistic coating technology for various uses, including welding thermal cracks and filling micro-pores. The effects of different oxide coatings on surface hardness, compressive residual stress, morphology and fatigue fracture morphology are discussed. A critical compressive residual stress of about 95 – 100 MPa is proposed...|$|R
