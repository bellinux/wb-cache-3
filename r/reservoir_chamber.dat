25|$|During {{the reign}} of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, Jaigarh Fort, which is located 150 miles {{south-west}} of Delhi, became one of the world's most efficient cannon foundries mainly due to the abundance of iron ore mines {{in the vicinity of the}} fort. The cannon foundry Jaigarh Fort had a massive wind tunnel that sucked air from the high mountains into its furnace creating temperatures as high as 2400°F, the heated air would melt the metal. The liquid molten metal would fill a <b>reservoir</b> <b>chamber</b> and into a cannon mold in the casting pit. Most of those cannons were massive, mostly 16ft long and had to be prepared within a single day. The Rajput also built a large ingenious mechanical device that had a precision gear system driven by four pairs of oxen, the device was used for hollowing out the cannon barrels. When the Mughal war of succession broke out in 1658 Dara Shikoh secured the cannon outpost of Jaigarh Fort until he was defeated and executed by his younger brother Aurangzeb. Later however, the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah appointed Jai Singh II as the official Mughal Qiladar of Jaigarh Fort according to a Firman, ultimately Jai Singh II is known to have molded the great Jaivana Cannon by utilizing the important foundry and devices inside Jaigarh Fort.|$|E

40|$|The {{non-destructive}} inspection of large concrete walls {{is still an}} unsolved problem. One possible technique is to use driven wheels for the propulsion and a vacuum system for the adhesion. The seals for the vacuum chambers are slipping over the rough surface, therefore it is not guaranteed that the chambers are always airproof. Especially over concrete walls a special seal construction must be found to make the adhesion more safe.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. The project of engine intake systems involves optimization of parameters such as the pipe length and diameter, junctions, and opening and closing times of the intake and exhaust valves. The correct sizing leads to an increase of the air mass admitted to the cylinders at the desired engine operational conditions. A suitable design of the intake valves in internal combustion engines {{is one of the}} factors that maximize the amount of intake air mass to the cylinder. The parameter that determines the maximization of the mass flow through the valves is called discharge coefficient. The mass flow through the valve is usually described by the compressible flow equation through a restriction, based on a dimensional analysis of an isentropic flow. In the present work, pressure variations caused by the valve movement were investigated experimentally considering an intake system. The objective was to study and compare the dynamic response of the flow through the intake valve. For this purpose, curves of mass flow rate and the dynamic pressure in several locations of the intake system were obtained. The experimental data were obtained from the intake system connected to a cylinder head. The cylinder head was installed in an air supply system consisted by a blower, a flow measurement device, and a <b>reservoir</b> <b>chamber.</b> The valves were driven by an electric motor with controlled rotational speed. The results showed that the correct design of the intake valve affects positively the air mass flow rate. cf 201...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the current}} {{microgravity}} crystal growth hardware is optimized to produce crystals within the limited time available on orbit. This often results in the actual nucleation and growth process being rushed or the system not coming to equilibrium within the limited time available. Longer duration hardware exists, but one cannot readily pick out crystals grown early versus those which nucleated and grew more slowly. We have devised a long duration apparatus, the Multi-chamber Dialysis Unit for Crystallization Kinetics, or McDUCK. This apparatus-is a series of protein chambers, stacked upon a precipitant <b>reservoir</b> <b>chamber.</b> All chambers are separated by a dialysis membrane, which serves to pass small molecules while retaining the protein. The volume of the Precipitant chamber {{is equal to the}} sum of the volumes of the protein chamber. In operation, the appropriate chambers are filled with precipitant solution or protein solution, and the McDUCK is placed standing upright, with the precipitant chamber on the bottom. The precipitant diffuses upwards over time, with the time to reach equilibration a function of the diffusivity of the precipitant and the overall length of the diffusion pathway. Typical equilibration times are approximately 2 - 4 months, and one can readily separate rapid from slow nucleation and growth crystals. An advantage on Earth is that the vertical precipitant concentration gradient dominates that of the solute, thus dampening out solute density gradient driven convective flows. However, large Earth-grown crystals have so far tended to be more two dimensional. Preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of lysozyme crystals grown in McDUCK have indicated that the best, and largest, come from the middle chambers, suggesting that there is an optimal growth rate. Further, the improvements in diffraction resolution have been better signal to noise ratios in the low resolution data, not an increase in resolution overall. Due to the persistently large crystals grown we are currently proposing McDUCK for the growth of macromolecule crystals for use in neutron diffraction studies...|$|E
40|$|The work-principle {{method was}} {{developed}} for theoretically resolving toxic fumes from non-ideal charge formulations. The whole description of a wanted process refers to macroscopic changes resulting from removing and imposing constraints that work {{one at a time}} to chronologically render trajectory terminal (key) states. The trajectory resolution utilizes a thermodynamic quasi-potential or negative work function, and numeric results require some appropriate standard thermodynamic (equilibrium) reaction code TDRC. The underlying method is unable to restrict reactions, tailor the work output or resolve states within the trajectory transitions, so the trajectory terminology is used somewhat figuratively. The work-principle model has the working fluid (reaction material) interacting with a tremendous <b>reservoir</b> (<b>chamber</b> air and walls), while forecasting the work performed upon a mechanical agent. Within the underground test chamber, the widening fume zone undergoes a decline in temperature, a reduction in reaction rates, resulting in out-of- equilibrium circumstances at the Q*-point, representing the measurement state. Rather than coping with the hard issues of non-equilibrium, the toxic fumes are resolved numerically for the Z-point, rendered by a zero-net- interaction energy constraint. Though other techniques require complex equation-of-state EOS for the whole trajectory, the work-principle formulation eludes the issue, requiring an EOS that works just for the terminal-state. Under the circumstances, the Z-state is reconcilable with the ideal-gas domain, and relevant TDRC results yield the restricted state in a numerical way for different charge formulations. The work principle makes it hard to remedy or to tamper with the resulting Z-point fumes: non-macroscopic trajectory readjustment is forsaken, terminal states are results rather than stipulations, and resetting the EOS formula constants would be ineffectual. Though the non-equilibrium portion remains unresolved, it is noteworthy that the work principle rigidly fixes the Z-state, thereby reducing the uncertainty for rendering reaction-rate models characterizing the non-equilibrium Z-Q* transition. Though more refinements are needed, some Z-point fume results are included to illustrate the threshold (minimum) resolving capacity of the work- principle formulation...|$|E

The experimental program was conducted in a 6 -in. model water tunnel previously used in design studies for the 36 -in. tunnel, and in a 10 -in. free-jet tunnel at the Laboratory. Tests were run on slotted-wall test sections 2. 18 and 2. 38 test-section diameters in length and indicated that perhaps 2. 5 diameters would be the maximum length possible without altering the diffuser following the test section. Axial pressures uniform within 1 / 2 per cent of the free stream dynamic pressure were obtained for a length of 2 test-section diameters. Velocity profiles in the test section compared favorably with those for a closed-jet test section, being flat within 1 per cent over 90 per cent of the diameter in the upstream portion, and over 80 per cent in the downstream portion of the useful test-section length.
