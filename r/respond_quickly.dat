5|$|The 6th Airborne Division in Palestine was {{initially}} posted {{to the region}} as the Imperial Strategic Reserve. It was envisioned as a mobile peace keeping force, positioned {{to be able to}} <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> to any area of the British Empire. In fact the division became involved in an internal security role between 1945 and 1948.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October, an NVA {{regiment}} attacked an Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) battalion at Song Be, {{capital of}} Phuoc Long Province. The North Vietnamese fought for several days, took casualties, and fell back. Two days later, the 273rd NLF Regiment attacked a Special Forces camp {{near the border}} town of Loc Ninh, in Binh Long Province. Troops of the US 1st Infantry Division were able to <b>respond</b> <b>quickly.</b> After a ten-day battle, the attackers were pushed back into Cambodia. At least 852 North Vietnamese soldiers were killed during the action, as opposed to 50 American and South Vietnamese dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{social life}} of a crocodilian begins while it {{is still in the}} egg, because the young start {{communicating}} with each other before they are hatched. It has been shown that a light tapping noise near the nest will be repeated by the young, one after another. Such early communication may help them to hatch simultaneously. Once it has broken out of the egg, a juvenile produces yelps and grunts, either spontaneously or as a result of external stimuli and even unrelated adults <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> to juvenile distress calls.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} {{games in the}} series, Wipeout 64 was {{developed}} by Liverpudlian developer Psygnosis and was published by Midway Games - marking {{the first and only}} time in the Wipeout series where one of the games were not published by Psygnosis or SCE Studio Liverpool (their future name). The game {{is one of the few}} N64 titles to have noticeable load times, disguised by the request 'Please Wait'. Load times between levels in Wipeout 64 are approximately a few seconds long due to the need for sound decompression, according to Psygnosis in a later interview with IGN. Psygnosis used the Nintendo 64's analogue stick to their benefit; thus rendering the D-Pad obsolete so that ships could <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> and more precisely in improvement regarding to the older games.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Dubourdieu, Captain Péridier on Flore ordered the French and Venetian ships to attack the British line directly. The {{battered}} Favorite led with an attempt to round Amphion and rake her before catching her in crossfire, as had been Dubourdieu's original intention. The remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron followed this lead and attempted to bring their superior numbers {{to bear on the}} British squadron. Hoste was prepared for this eventuality and immediately ordered his ships to wear, turning south and then east to reverse direction. This movement threw the Franco-Venetian squadron into confusion and as a result the squadron's formation became disorganised. Favorite, which had lost almost its entire complement of officers, was unable to <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> enough to the manoeuvre and drove onto the rocky coastline in confusion, becoming a total wreck.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Mesa resigned, {{citing the}} {{pressure}} of Morales and the cocalero road blocks and riots. Amid fears of civil war, Eduardo Rodríguez became President of a transitional government, preparing Bolivia for a general election in December 2005. Hiring the Peruvian Walter Chávez as its campaign manager, the MAS electoral campaign was based on Salvador Allende's successful campaign in the Chilean presidential election, 1970. Measures were implemented to institutionalize the party structure, giving it greater independence from the social movement; this was done to allow Morales and other MAS leaders to <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> to new developments without the lengthy process of consulting the bases, and to present a more moderate image away from the bases' radicalism. Although he had initially hoped for a female running mate, Morales eventually chose Marxist intellectual Álvaro García Linera as his Vice Presidential candidate, with some Bolivian press speculating as to a romantic relationship between the two. MAS' primary opponent was Jorge Quiroga and his center-right Social and Democratic Power, whose campaign was centered in Santa Cruz and which advocated continued neo-liberal reform; Quiroga accused Morales of promoting the legalization of cocaine and being a puppet for Venezuela.|$|E

25|$|Under Bill Knowland's ownership, the Tribune had a {{conservative}} editorial position and {{a reputation for}} being strongly pro-business. As the city of Oakland became more ethnically and politically diverse in the 1960s and 1970s, the Tribune was unable to <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> enough to the demographic changes (and the political and social unrest exemplified, among other factors, by the University of California, Berkeley, student uprisings and the Black Panther movement).|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{cells are}} {{short-lived}} cells (2–3 days) that secrete antibodies. These antibodies bind to antigens, making them easier targets for phagocytes, and trigger the complement cascade. About 10% of plasma cells survive to become long-lived antigen-specific memory B cells. Already primed to produce specific antibodies, these cells {{can be called}} upon to <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> if the same pathogen re-infects the host, while the host experiences few, if any, symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Trogons are {{territorial}} and monogamous. Males will <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> to playbacks {{of their}} calls and will repel {{other members of}} the same species and even other hole-nesting species from around their nesting sites. Males attract females by singing, and, {{in the case of the}} resplendent quetzal, undertaking display flights. Some species have been observed in small flocks of 3–12 individuals prior to and sometimes during the breeding season, calling and chasing each other, but the function of these flocks is unclear.|$|E

25|$|Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and {{ambulance}} technician are terms used in {{some countries}} to denote a health care provider of emergency medical services. EMTs are clinicians, trained to <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> to emergency situations regarding medical issues, traumatic injuries and accident scenes. Under the British system {{and those that are}} influenced by it, they are referred to as ambulance technicians (often shortened to techs), while in the American system and its influenced countries, they are referred to as emergency medical technicians.|$|E
25|$|The AC-to-AC {{efficiency}} of hydrogen storage {{has been shown}} to be on the order of 20 to 45%, which imposes economic constraints. The price ratio between purchase and sale of electricity must be at least proportional to the efficiency in order for the system to be economic. Hydrogen fuel cells can <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> enough to correct rapid fluctuations in electricity demand or supply and regulate frequency. Whether hydrogen can use natural gas infrastructure depends on the network construction materials, standards in joints, and storage pressure.|$|E
25|$|According to Colwell, {{the quality}} and {{inclusiveness}} of a country's health care system affects the control of cholera, {{as it did in}} the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak. While sanitation practices are important, when governments <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> and have readily available vaccines, the country will have a lower cholera death toll. Affordability of vaccines can be a problem; if the governments do not provide vaccinations, only the wealthy may be able to afford them and there will be a greater toll on the country's poor. The speed with which government leaders respond to cholera outbreaks is important.|$|E

50|$|On 15 July 2015, museum {{personnel}} were evacuated from Midway due to smoke {{caused by an}} apparent fire. The San Diego fire department <b>responded</b> <b>quickly,</b> but no fire was found, and the museum was able to open for the day on schedule.|$|R
50|$|There was no {{throttle}} valve or regulator {{to control the}} engine speed. As was commonly used on single-pass spiral monotube boilers, the burner output was regulated instead with the fuel valve and the boiler <b>responded</b> <b>quickly</b> enough {{for this to be}} sufficient.|$|R
25|$|After further ocean landing tests, {{the first}} stage of the CRS-5 launch vehicle {{attempted}} to land on a floating platform, the autonomous spaceport drone ship, in January 2015. The rocket guided itself to the ship successfully but landed too hard for survival. The first stage of the CRS-6 mission managed a soft landing on the platform; however, excess lateral velocity caused it to quickly tip over and explode. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk indicated that a throttle valve for the engine was stuck and did not <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> enough to achieve a smooth landing.|$|E
25|$|When Odom and {{his agent}} did not <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> enough, owner Jerry Buss pulled both deals off the table. At the same time, the Miami Heat {{actively}} pursue Odom. Heat President Pat Riley and Dwyane Wade met with Odom in Los Angeles {{in an attempt}} to get Odom to return to Miami. Afterwards, Odom spoke with Jerry Buss, and Odom's agent and Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak kept an open dialogue. On July 30, Lamar Odom agreed to a four-year deal, reportedly for $33 million, with a team option for the final year. Odom said {{he did not want to}} leave Pau Gasol, Andrew Bynum, Derek Fisher and the rest of the Lakers, especially Kobe Bryant.|$|E
25|$|Another {{difficulty}} was communications. The Air Signals Corps was {{put under}} severe pressure. Radio signals over vast areas were vulnerable to interception so telephone lines were used instead. The line from Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VII to Kesselring's command train at Luftflotte 2 was 780 miles. Telephone communications were vulnerable to Partisans. However, {{the development of}} radio and their use with forward air controllers, the Flivos was critical and remained unaffected. In this tactical sphere, reports received could be acted upon in real time by use of radio in a short time, lessening {{the ability of the}} enemy to react. It enabled the Luftwaffe to <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> to fluid events right at the front.|$|E
50|$|South Korea fell {{within the}} USAF Far East Air Forces (FEAF) Area of Responsibility (AOR), and Far East Air Force units <b>responded</b> <b>quickly</b> and {{effectively}} in the first critical week of the war, proving {{in many ways the}} utility of air power in modern war.|$|R
50|$|From Cuzco the Huascarites {{attacked}} {{the armies of}} general Atoc and defeated Atahualpa {{in the battle of}} Chillopampa. However, the Atahualapite generals <b>responded</b> <b>quickly.</b> They gathered together their scattered troops, counter-attacked, and forcefully defeated Atoc in Mulliambato. They captured Atoc, and later tortured and killed him.|$|R
50|$|Kansas City retook {{the lead}} in the third quarter, on a 15-play, 75-yard drive that took 10 minutes off the clock and ended with Jim Otis' 1-yard score. Miami <b>responded</b> <b>quickly</b> though, {{storming}} right back to tie the game with a 1-yard touchdown run from Jim Kiick.|$|R
25|$|A {{comprehensive}} programme {{of organizational}} reform and culture change began in 2008 {{after the release}} of an Independent External Evaluation. Headquarters restructuring and delegation of decision making created a flatter more responsive structure and reduced costs. Modernizing and streamlining of administrative and operational processes took place. Improved internal teamwork and closer external partnerships coupled with upgrading of IT infrastructure and greater autonomy of FAO's decentralized offices now allows the Organization to <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> where needs are greatest. As FAO is primarily a knowledge based organization, investing in human resources is a top priority. Capacity building including a leadership programme, employee rotation and a new junior professional programme were established. Individual performance management, an ethics and ombudsman officer and an independent office of evaluation were designed to improve performance through learning and strengthened oversight.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the mid-1950s, the EFS grew {{stronger}} and more organised, and volunteers began to campaign {{for the establishment of}} the EFS as a statutory authority. This was achieved in 1976 with the passing of the Country Fires Act through the South Australian Government which retitled the EFS as the Country Fire Service (CFS). The Country Fires Act, 1989 pulled the control of the CFS away from district councils to the State Government, allowing {{for the development of a}} standardised service able to <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> to emergencies across South Australia. In the late 1990s, as part of a drive to ensure that the CFS was properly equipped, another major change in funding was brought in, and the administration of the Service was combined with the administration of several other emergency services.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} {{composition of}} ketchup is what creates ketchup's pseudoplastic characteristics. Small polysaccharides, sugars, acids, and water {{make up the}} majority of the metastable ketchup product, and these small structures are able to move more easily throughout a matrix because of their low mass. While exposed to shear stress, the molecules within the suspension are able to <b>respond</b> <b>quickly</b> and create an alignment within the product. The bonds between the molecules are mostly hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and electrostatic interactions, all of which can be broken when subject to stress. Hydrogen bonds are constantly rearranging within a product due to their need to be in the lowest energy state, which further confirms that the bonds between the molecules will be easily disrupted. This alignment only lasts for as long as shear stress is applied. The molecules return to their original disorganized state once the shear stress dissipates.|$|E
50|$|When Abba Jifar II grew senile in {{his later}} years, Abba Jobir {{attempted}} to seize the throne of the Kingdom of Jimma. However, Emperor Haile Selassie <b>responded</b> <b>quickly</b> and sent military forces against Abba Jobir. They {{brought him back to}} Addis Ababa, where he was imprisoned.|$|R

50|$|Tecumseh {{returned}} {{and began to}} rebuild the confederacy. Allying with the British in Canada at {{the outbreak of the}} War of 1812, Tecumseh began a series of coordinated raids, attacking American posts in Indian territories. The Americans <b>responded</b> <b>quickly</b> and launched a second campaign, destroying Prophetstown a second time.|$|R
