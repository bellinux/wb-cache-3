40|$|During the {{economic}} globalization process in world, {{the trend of}} regional economic cooperation becomes more prominent. Along with China’s entry into WTO, Asia becomes the center of world economic development at the new century. East Asia is the principal part of Asian economic development.

Economies of counties in Northeast Asia are complement and have great potentials and spaces for cooperation. Driven by different parties, the regional economic cooperation in Northeast Asia, represented by the Tumen River International Cooperation Development Project, achieves many important progresses at present.

40|$|The {{investment}} agreement {{relationship between}} China and Japan is complex. The many intersecting and overlapping agreements can rightly {{be described as}} a "noodle bowl of agreements. " The 1989 bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between China and Japan still stands. Japan can also free-ride on the negotiation outcome of China's BITs and free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries by using the most-favored-nation (MFN) provision in the 1989 China-Japan BIT, which does not contain <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> <b>organization</b> (REIO) exception rules. However, because the China-Japan BIT does not have investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), it may face implementation problems. The China-Japan-Korea trilateral investment treaty (CJK TIT), in force since 2014, made improvements upon the 1989 BIT, but Japan is not entirely satisfied with the outcome. For Japan, pre-establishment national treatment (NT) and prohibition of various types of performance requirements are the most important negotiation items, but the CJK TIT insufficiently addressed those problems. Moreover, because the CJK TIT has MFN provisions with an REIO exception rule, better access to investment markets brought about by future FTAs such as the China-Korea FTA and the EU-China FTA cannot be imported into CJK TIT. Hence, in the long run, Japan needs to pursue an FTA investment chapter with China that covers both MFN and ISDS...|$|E

40|$|The European Community is {{the only}} <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> <b>organization</b> that has joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as a party. The EU- 15 has {{committed}} itself to report annually on greenhouse gas inventories within the area covered by its EU- 15 Member States. The quality of the EC-inventory depends strongly {{on the quality of}} the national greenhouse gas inventories, including the comparability of the methodologies used and the definitions applied. This paper reviews the actual quality of the national inventory reports of the EU- 15 Member States submitted in 2005 and the resulting quality of the EU inventory, focusing on the sector ‘agriculture’ of the Common Reporting Format. For this sector, a workshop to improve inventory quality was organized at the Joint Research Centre (European Commission). The most uncertain source category in the majority of greenhouse gas inventories is N 2 O emissions from agricultural soils. Even though the body of information on factors influencing the magnitude of this emission source is already considerable, well designed experimental studies, particularly in southern and eastern European climate regions are needed. Still, it will be unlikely that measurement programmes alone will be sufficient to reduce the uncertainty in this source category. Rather the use of process based models will have to play a role in the future in the inventory process for estimating N 2 O emissions directly or in the frame of a broader modelling framework that ensures a holistic view of the impact of agriculture on the environment.
