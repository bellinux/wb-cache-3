5|$|New {{features}} included 128KB RAM, three-channel audio via the AY-3-8912 chip, MIDI compatibility, an <b>RS-232</b> serial port, an RGB monitor port, 32KB of ROM {{including an}} improved BASIC editor, and an external keypad.|$|E
5|$|The ZX Interface 1 add-on module {{included}} 8KB of ROM, an <b>RS-232</b> serial port, {{a proprietary}} LAN interface (called ZX Net), and an interface for {{the connection of}} up to eight ZX Microdrives– somewhat unreliable but speedy tape-loop cartridge storage devices released in July 1983. These were used in a revised version on the Sinclair QL, whose storage format was electrically compatible but logically incompatible with the Spectrum's. Sinclair also released the ZX Interface 2 which added two joystick ports and a ROM cartridge port.|$|E
25|$|Although powerful, the {{internal}} modem was commercially impractical. Not {{only did it}} require special driver software, but a different hardware design was needed for every computer bus, including Apple II, S-100, TRS-80, and others. Some popular computers, like the Atari 400, did not even integrate internal slots. An obvious solution was to use the <b>RS-232</b> serial port; modems were serial devices and generally driven off <b>RS-232</b> anyway, and most computer designs included an <b>RS-232</b> port, or some variant.|$|E
25|$|Barcode {{scanners}} can {{be classified}} into three categories based on their connection to the computer. The older type is the <b>RS-232</b> barcode scanner. This type requires special programming for transferring the input data to the application program.|$|E
25|$|Modern meters may be {{interfaced}} with {{a personal}} computer by IrDA links, <b>RS-232</b> connections, USB, or an instrument bus such as IEEE-488. The interface allows the computer to record measurements as they are made. Some DMMs can store measurements and upload them to a computer.|$|E
25|$|The A600 {{features}} Amiga-specific connectors {{including two}} DB9M ports for joysticks, mice, and light pens, a standard 25-pin <b>RS-232</b> serial port and a 25-pin Centronics parallel port. As a result, the A600 {{is compatible with}} many peripherals available for earlier Amiga models, such as MIDI, sound samplers and video-capture devices.|$|E
25|$|Iridium 9601 Supports only SBD, several {{tracking}} {{devices and}} other products have been built around this modem. It was an Iridium manufactured product designed as an OEM module for integration into applications that only use the Iridium Short Burst Data Service. Short Burst Data applications are supported through an <b>RS-232</b> interface. Examples of these solutions include maritime vessel tracking or automatic vehicle tracking.|$|E
25|$|When {{the machine}} first shipped, {{flipping}} {{switches on the}} front panel {{was the only way}} to get programs or data into the machine, and the only output from the programs was the patterns of lights on the panel. Nevertheless, many were sold in this form. Roberts was already hard at work on additional cards, including a paper tape reader for storage, additional RAM cards, and a <b>RS-232</b> interface to connect to a proper Teletype terminal.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the right}} side of the {{instrument}} panel is an ITT Cannon D-subminiature plug providing <b>RS-232</b> serial communication, into which a computer can be plugged into to download engine monitoring information. The software to run this is included on a CD-ROM that comes with the plane. This has been upgraded to an EDI card (engine Data Information). This card is a memory card much like in a digital camera, and records all engine data from 0 hours, until the 2000 hour TBO and can be read with a card reader to diagnose problems and observe flight characteristics in real time.|$|E
25|$|The Altair bus {{consists}} of the pins of the Intel 8080 run out onto the backplane. No particular level of thought went into the design, which led to such disasters as shorting from various power lines of differing voltages being located next to each other. Another oddity was that the system included two unidirectional 8-bit data buses, but only a single bidirectional 16-bit address bus. A deal on power supplies led {{to the use of}} +8V and +18V, which had to be locally regulated on the cards to TTL (+5V) or <b>RS-232</b> (+12V) standard voltage levels.|$|E
25|$|The first desktop {{programmable}} calculators {{were produced}} in the mid-1960s by Mathatronics and Casio (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the HP-65, in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the HP-25C introduced continuous memory, i.e., programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first alphanumeric, programmable, expandable calculator, the HP-41C. It could be expanded with random access memory (RAM, for memory) and read-only memory (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like bar code readers, microcassette and floppy disk drives, paper-roll thermal printers, and miscellaneous communication interfaces (<b>RS-232,</b> HP-IL, HP-IB).|$|E
25|$|Bit {{numbering}} is {{a concept}} similar to endianness, but on a level of bits, not bytes. Bit endianness or bit-level endianness refers to the transmission order of bits over a serial medium. The bit-level analogue of little-endian (least significant bit goes first) is used in <b>RS-232,</b> Ethernet, and USB. Some protocols use the opposite ordering (e.g. Teletext, I²C, SMBus, PMBus, and SONET and SDH). Usually, there exists a consistent view to the bits irrespective of their order in the byte, such that the latter becomes relevant only on a very low level. One exception {{is caused by the}} feature of some cyclic redundancy checks to detect all burst errors up to a known length, which would be spoiled if the bit order is different from the byte order on serial transmission.|$|E
500|$|NAIT XS: Reviewers have {{described}} the XS as a [...] " [...] in the slimmer casework of the Series S". It also has a 3.5mm stereo input with auto-switching on the front-panel, suitable for an MP3 player. A powered input, provided for turntable users, is designed to supply one of Naim's external phono pre-amplifiers. The unity gain option and AV bypass function {{allow it to be}} used in conjunction with an AV processor in a home cinema system. It also includes optional <b>RS-232</b> interface for custom installations.|$|E

2500|$|Motorola 9505 Large brick shaped handset {{manufactured}} from 1999 to 2002 by {{the first}} corporate incarnation of Iridium. [...] Native <b>RS-232</b> data interface with proprietary pinout adapter.|$|E
2500|$|Serial bridge packets– {{asynchronous}} {{serial data}} may be sent between CobraNet devices {{on the same}} network. [...] Many standard asynchronous serial formats are supported, including <b>RS-232,</b> RS-422, RS-485 and MIDI.|$|E
2500|$|Iridium 9505A Large brick shaped {{satellite}} handset manufactured from 2002 to 2008 by {{the second}} corporate incarnation of Iridium. [...] Externally almost {{identical to the original}} Motorola 9505. Native <b>RS-232</b> data interface with proprietary pinout adapter.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the lack}} of Amiga 2000-compatible {{internal}} expansion slots, there are many ports and expansion options. There are two DE9M Atari joystick ports for joysticks or mice, stereo audio (RCA connectors 1V p-p). There is a floppy drive port for daisy-chaining up to three extra floppy disk drives via an DB23F connector. The then-standard <b>RS-232</b> serial port (DB25M) and Centronics parallel port (DB25F) are also included. The power supply is ( [...] , [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Intended to be a 68008-based home computer, {{equipped}} with built-in ZX Microdrive, joystick, <b>RS-232</b> and ZX Net ports. Sinclair's SuperBASIC programming language was originally intended for this model but was later adopted for the QL. SuperSpectrum was cancelled in 1982 after the specification of the ZX83 (QL) had converged with it. [...] This project {{is not to}} be confused with Loki, which was described as the [...] "SuperSpectrum" [...] in an article in the June 1986 issue of Sinclair User magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Despite appearances, these {{machines}} were not simply Selectric typewriters with an <b>RS-232</b> connector added. [...] As with other electric typewriters and electric adding machines of the era, Selectrics are electromechanical, not electronic, devices: The only electrical components are the power cord, power switch, and electric motor. The electric motor runs continuously. [...] The keys are not electrical pushbuttons {{such as those}} found on a computer keyboard. Pressing a key does not produce an electrical signal as output, but rather engages a series of clutches which couple the motor power to the mechanism to turn and tilt the element. A Selectric would work equally well if hand-cranked (or foot-powered, like treadle powered sewing machines) at sufficient speed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem was}} how to move from mode to mode. One option would be to signal this change—"put {{yourself}} into command mode"—via {{one of the many}} pins in the <b>RS-232</b> cable. However, while the 25-pin connector on the modem side had more than enough pins for this purpose (even some meant for this purpose), the computer side often used a much smaller 9-pin connector, and equally often many of these pins were not actually connected or accessible from software. In fact, there were very few pins that were guaranteed to work on all computers, mostly the data in and out, [...] "ready" [...] indications that said whether the modem or computer was operational, and sometimes flow-control pins.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{bandwidth}} limitations, transparent TCP/IP is supported. [...] Iridium claims {{data rates}} up to 10 {{kilobits per second}} for their [...] "direct Internet" [...] service which utilizes v.42bis compression over a PPP dialup connection to Iridium's Arizona gateway. [...] Actual data rates remain at 2300 to 2400 bit/s for any compressed data such as a JPG image or ZIP file, but plain text or HTML may transfer [...] "up to" [...] 10 kbit/s. [...] Iridium 9500, 9505 and 9505A phones can be connected to computers using an <b>RS-232</b> connection, as can the 9522A transceiver module. [...] The 9555 and Extreme phones connect to computers with a standard USB cable, using an internal USB to serial bridge chip and Windows drivers to emulate a serial COM port for compatibility with standard PPP clients.|$|E
2500|$|Conical {{micrometer}} anvils, specifically {{suited to}} {{resting on the}} sides of the thread, are made for various thread angles, with 60° being the most common. Mics with such anvils are usually called [...] "thread mics" [...] or [...] "pitch mics" [...] (because they directly measure the pitch diameter). Users who lack thread mics rely instead on the [...] "3-wire method", which involves placing 3 short pieces of wire (or gauge pins) of known diameter into the valleys of the thread and then measuring from wire to wire with standard (flat) anvils. A conversion factor (produced by a straightforward trigonometric calculation) is then multiplied with the measured value to infer a measurement of the thread's pitch diameter. Tables of these conversion factors were established many decades ago for all standard thread sizes, so today a user need only take the measurement and then perform the table lookup (as opposed to recalculating each time). The 3-wire method is also used when high precision is needed to inspect a specific diameter, commonly the pitch diameter, or on specialty threads such as multi-start or when the thread angle is not 60°. [...] Ball-shaped micrometer anvils can be used in similar fashion (same trigonometric relationship, less cumbersome to use). Digital calipers and micrometers can send each measurement (data point) as it occurs to storage or software through an interface (such as USB or <b>RS-232),</b> in which case the table lookup is done in an automated way, and quality assurance and quality control can be achieved using statistical process control.|$|E
50|$|This {{scheme is}} also {{employed}} in present-day <b>RS-232</b> to RS-485 converters. RS-485 is a multiple-access bus on which only one device can transmit at a time, {{a concept that}} is not provided for in <b>RS-232.</b> The <b>RS-232</b> device asserts RTS to tell the converter {{to take control of}} the RS-485 bus so that the converter, and thus the <b>RS-232</b> device, can send data onto the bus.|$|E
50|$|This {{class can}} be used for {{industrial}} equipment such as CNC machinery to allow upgrading from older <b>RS-232</b> serial controllers and robotics, since they can keep software compatibility. The device attaches to an <b>RS-232</b> communications line and the operating system on the USB side makes the USB device appear as a traditional <b>RS-232</b> port. Chip manufacturers such as Prolific Technology, FTDI, Microchip, and Atmel provide facilities for developing USB <b>RS-232</b> devices.|$|E
50|$|In {{the book}} PC 97 Hardware Design Guide, Microsoft {{deprecated}} {{support for the}} <b>RS-232</b> compatible serial port of the original IBM PC design. Today, <b>RS-232</b> has mostly been replaced in personal computers by USB for local communications. Advantages compared to <b>RS-232</b> are that USB is faster, uses lower voltages, and has connectors that are simpler to connect and use. Disadvantages of USB compared to <b>RS-232</b> are that USB is far less immune to EMI and that maximum cable length is much shorter (15 meters for <b>RS-232</b> v.s. 3 - 5 meters for USB depending on USB speed used).|$|E
50|$|RS-422 is {{a common}} {{solution}} for <b>RS-232</b> extenders. These consist of <b>RS-232</b> ports on either end of an RS-422 connection.|$|E
50|$|<b>RS-232</b> is a {{specification}} for {{serial communication}} that is popular in analytical and scientific instruments, {{as well for}} controlling peripherals such as printers. Unlike GPIB, with the <b>RS-232</b> interface, {{it is possible to}} connect and control only one device at a time. <b>RS-232</b> is also a relatively slow interface with typical data rates of less than 20 kbytes/s. <b>RS-232</b> is best suited for laboratory applications compatible with a slower, less rugged connection.|$|E
50|$|In today's {{world of}} {{communications}} most people knows of Local Area Network (LAN) {{which is based}} on Ethernet, a network system used in personal computers where one PC is able to talk to another PCs. In embedded system, <b>RS-232</b> TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) has dominated the market {{over a longer period of}} time as the most common communication standard that also works as an internal embedded network system. With the use of MAX 232 integrated circuit (IC), the <b>RS-232</b> TTL may connect to an external <b>RS-232</b> connection where the immediate advantage of using MAX 232 is that there is no need of using positive and negative power supply. It is also possible to connect to USB via <b>RS-232</b> to USB converter, and even if the original standard for <b>RS-232</b> was basically a point-to-point system for the serial port on PCs, it is still possible to use <b>RS-232</b> in small local area network using micro-controller and source code to control the signals and data transmission.|$|E
50|$|An <b>RS-232</b> {{serial port}} {{was once a}} {{standard}} feature of a personal computer, used for connections to modems, printers, mice, data storage, uninterruptible power supplies, and other peripheral devices. However, <b>RS-232,</b> {{when compared to other}} serial interfaces such as RS-422, RS-485 and Ethernet, is hampered by low transmission speed, short maximum cable length, large voltage swing, large standard connectors, no multipoint capability and limited multidrop capability. In modern personal computers, USB has displaced <b>RS-232</b> from most of its peripheral interface roles. Many computers no longer come equipped with <b>RS-232</b> ports (although some motherboards come equipped with a COM port header that allows the user to install a bracket with a DE-9 port) and must use either an external USB-to-RS-232 converter or an internal expansion card with one or more serial ports to connect to <b>RS-232</b> peripherals. Nevertheless, thanks to their simplicity and past ubiquity, <b>RS-232</b> interfaces are still used—particularly in industrial machines, networking equipment, and scientific instruments where a short-range, point-to-point, low-speed wired data connection is adequate.|$|E
50|$|The {{asynchronous}} {{serial port}} {{is not a}} true <b>RS-232</b> port as it uses different voltage levels and a non-standard connector. An external converter/adapter is required to interface with <b>RS-232</b> equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Because <b>RS-232</b> is used {{beyond the}} {{original}} purpose of interconnecting a terminal with a modem, successor standards {{have been developed}} to address the limitations. Issues with the <b>RS-232</b> standard include: ...|$|E
50|$|The MAX232(A) has two {{receivers}} that convert from <b>RS-232</b> to TTL voltage levels, and two drivers that convert from TTL {{logic to}} <b>RS-232</b> voltage levels. As a result, only {{two out of}} all <b>RS-232</b> signals can be converted in each direction. Typically, the first driver/receiver pair of the MAX232 is used for TX and RX signals, and the second one for CTS and RTS signals.|$|E
5000|$|Null modem is a {{communication}} method to directly connect two DTEs (computer, terminal, printer, etc.) using an <b>RS-232</b> serial cable. The name {{stems from the}} historical use of <b>RS-232</b> cables to connect two teleprinter devices to two modems in order to communicate with one another; null modem communication refers to using a crossed-over <b>RS-232</b> cable to connect the teleprinters directly to one another without the modems.|$|E

50|$|The STK600 allows {{in-system}} programming {{from the}} PC via USB, leaving the <b>RS-232</b> port {{available for the}} target microcontroller. A 4 pin header on the STK600 labeled 'RS-232 spare' can connect any TTL level USART port on the chip to an onboard MAX232 chip to translate the signals to <b>RS-232</b> levels.
