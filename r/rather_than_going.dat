The line was completed on June 7, 1986, when it was extended by four stations to Vienna in the I-66 median.|$|E
5|$|The coup {{ultimately}} failed, as it {{met with}} the resistance {{of most of the}} warriors, who were opposed to the king's assassination. As a result, the Lombard garrison in Ticinum proclaimed Duke Cleph the new king, and Helmichis, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>going</b> to war against overwhelming odds, escaped to Ravenna with Longinus' assistance, taking with him his wife, his troops, the royal treasure and Alboin's daughter Albsuinda. In Ravenna the two lovers became estranged and killed each other. Subsequently, Longinus sent Albsuinda and the treasure to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|A senior {{national}} team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the Polish Army, {{said he saw}} the goalkeeper and the journalist reach the hotel in a taxi soon after 05:00—but <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>going</b> to his room, Młynarczyk then left again with Zieliński before returning again around 07:00. Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, Bernard Blaut, confronted Smolarek and told him that Młynarczyk was to stay behind.|$|E

50|$|Without the {{guidance}} provided by lane markings, drivers {{in the early}} days often erred in favor of keeping closer {{to the middle of the}} road, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> risk <b>going</b> off-road into ditches or trees. This practice often left inadequate room for opposing traffic.|$|R
50|$|Höllerer {{tends to}} take a {{co-ordinating}} role when an operation is being planned, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> actually <b>going</b> undercover or making the arrest himself.

5|$|<b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>going</b> to war, Helmichis, Rosamund {{and their}} {{followers}} escaped to Ravenna, {{the capital of}} Byzantine Italy, where they were received with full honours by the authorities. Once in Ravenna, Rosamund was persuaded by the Byzantine prefect Longinus to kill Helmichis {{in order to be}} free to marry him. Rosamund proceeded to poison Helmichis, but the latter, having understood what his wife had done to him, forced her to drink the cup too, so both of them died. After their deaths, Longinus dispatched Helmichis' forces to Constantinople, while the remaining Lombards had already found a new king in Cleph.|$|E
5|$|This {{station was}} rebuilt as Ashford International {{during the early}} 1990s for {{international}} services from mainland Europe; this included the addition of two platforms {{to the north of}} station (the original down island platform had been taken over by international services). Unlike normal LGV stations in France, the through tracks for Ashford International railway station are off to one side <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>going</b> through. The number of services was reduced after the opening of the Ebbsfleet station. A high-speed domestic service operated by Southeastern to London St Pancras began on 29 June 2009.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>going</b> to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E
50|$|A human rebirth is {{considered}} to have tremendous potential when used correctly, however we usually waste our human lifetime in materialistic pursuits, and end up reinforcing our unhelpful emotions, thoughts, and actions.

5|$|Movie {{director}} Kevin Smith {{has been}} a fan of the Degrassi series from the early 1990s, when he worked at a convenience store in Leonardo, New Jersey. Actor Jason Mewes was his co-worker at the store and also became a fan. Every Sunday morning at work, Smith and Mewes watched episodes of Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High on Public Broadcasting Service. Smith enjoyed the earlier series and has acknowledged an infatuation with Stacie Mistysyn. He has also paid homage to Degrassi by referring to it in several of his films. He named a Clerks character Caitlin Bree after Mistysin's Degrassi character, Caitlin Ryan, wrote Shannen Doherty's character Rene wearing a Degrassi jacket throughout his Mallrats film, and had Jason Lee's character in Chasing Amy specifically mention Degrassi Junior High as a TV show he wants to watch, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>going</b> out. Smith and Mewes guest starred as themselves in the final three episodes of the fourth season. The plot for these episodes involves the pair working on Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh!, a fictional feature film in the View Askewniverse, using Degrassi Community School as a filming location.|$|E

50|$|Defendants were summoned {{under the}} {{formulary}} {{system in a}} similar manner to under the legis actiones. The defendant was still summoned orally, but had an extra option; <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> immediately <b>going</b> to court, he could make a vadimonium, or promise, to appear in court on a certain day, on pain of a pecuniary forfeit. Although the plaintiff could still physically drag his opponent to court, this was scarcely used. Instead, the plaintiff could be given permission by the praetor to take possession of the defendant's estate, with a possible right of sale.|$|R
5000|$|The National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights criticized Product Red for its {{links with}} Gap, which was {{historically}} {{a target of}} anti-sweatshop activists, although anti-sweatshop organization Labour Behind the Label states that Gap has [...] "come further than many" [...] clothing companies to counter exploitation. Gap's Product Red clothes are made in Lesotho <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> China, <b>going</b> beyond the requirements of Product Red.

25|$|The {{reason for}} {{the high number of}} people driving under a Provisional Licence under the old system was because a Provisional Licence holder could drive unaccompanied after obtaining their second Provisional Licence, and many drivers chose this route <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>going</b> through the full testing process.

50|$|Stylistically, Caravaggio used a {{technique}} he {{was famous for}} developing called chiaroscuro. Chiaroscuro is a contrast between dark and light.

50|$|The tournament {{generated}} a record low goals-per-game average and a then-record of 16 red cards were handed out.

Two exceptions were the eventual champions West Germany and hosts Italy, the only teams to win three of their four knockout matches in normal time.

50|$|During World War II {{it became}} {{impossible}} for the Hadhramis in Singapore to travel abroad but they continued to do so thereafter. However, after the Rent Control Act came into effect, Hadrami incomes were frozen and {{it became clear that}} the wakaf (trust) incomes would not be sufficient for the next generation. It was then that the Arab families took a keener interest in the education of their children. The richer families sent their children to London to study and the children of others spent time working in Aden <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> just <b>going</b> to Hadhramaut. The cultural and linguistic links were still maintained. However, the family incomes continued to decline.|$|R

And neither player should be able to drag the game out indefinitely either to avoid losing or to irritate the other player. Possible methods include: the super-ko rule, time control, or placing an upper bound on the number of moves. This is also affected by the scoring method used since territory scoring penalizes extended play after the boundaries of the territories have been settled.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we present new {{modeling}} and analysis technique for characterizing the steady state {{performance of a}} TCP flow. We invert the loss process in our model, by treating loss events arriving at the source as a Poisson stream <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> packets <b>going</b> out on the network with some loss probability. This enables us to model the window size behavior as a Poisson Counter driven Stochastic Differential Equation and perform analysis. We use the data collected in [1] to validate our modeling and analysis technique. Results indicate that our model is able to capture the behavior of TCP throughput quite accurately. Our technique enables simple fluid analysis of TCP and other TCP-like congestion control mechanism. I...|$|R
