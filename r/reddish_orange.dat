5|$|Mycenastrum corium subsp. ferrugineum {{has a deep}} rusty red to <b>reddish</b> <b>orange</b> gleba, clearly {{distinguishing}} it {{from the}} glebal coloring of the main subspecies. M.corium var. diabolicum has an extremely spiny capillitium.|$|E
5|$|Nikolai Zarudny and Härms {{described}} a subspecies, rubripersonatus, from Baluchistan in 1902. This was {{described a}}s having a deeper <b>reddish</b> <b>orange</b> skin {{on the head and}} a yellow-tipped dark bill. This has rarely been considered a valid subspecies but the intermediate pattern of bill colouration suggests intermixing of subspecies.|$|E

50|$|Along with Michael A. Smith and Dr. David Heiden, DeVore contributed {{photos to}} an {{exhibition}} promoting international social awareness in 1983 at the Joanne Lyon Gallery. Included {{on the opening}} reception invitation was his Women on the Beach, an impressionistic photo of women in colorful, local dress, standing on a white sandy beach at the water’s edge. Completely created in-camera, the print is awash in pastels and muted blues and yellows and <b>reddish</b> <b>oranges.</b>|$|R
50|$|The slender {{inflorescence}} stalks are naked {{but usually}} woolly and produce flower clusters at the top. The flowers are yellow and darken to <b>reddish</b> or <b>orange.</b>|$|R
500|$|The mainly {{long and}} {{cylindrical}} stipe is <b>reddish</b> <b>orange.</b> It is [...] (rarely [...] ) long, [...] wide and barely foveate or blotchy.

500|$|Some other polypores {{are roughly}} similar in {{appearance}} to H.nidulans {{and might be}} confused with it. Phellinus gilvus has a yellowish to rusty-yellow fibrous cap, yellowish-brown flesh that stains black in KOH, and a grayish-brown to dark brown pore surface. Hapalopilus croceus produces large fruit bodies with caps up to [...] in diameter. Its pore surface is bright <b>reddish</b> <b>orange</b> when fresh, and its flesh stains red with KOH. Pycnoporus cinnabarinus has a tougher fruit body and is a brighter red color. The edible [...] "beefsteak fungus" [...] Fistulina hepatica may readily be confused with H.nidulans. It has soft, blood-red fruit bodies that ooze red juice. Also edible, the [...] "chicken of the woods", Laetiporus sulphureus, has bright yellow fruit bodies whose color fades in age.|$|E
500|$|The young fruiting {{bodies are}} {{initially}} white and spherical or egg-shaped, partially submerged in the ground, with dimensions of [...] by [...] As the fruit body matures, the egg ruptures and the spongy spore-bearing stalk emerges; fully grown, {{it may be}} from [...] long and [...] thick. The stalk is hollow and strongly wrinkled overall; its shape is cylindrical below, but it gradually tapers to a narrow apex with a small opening at the tip. The upper half of the stalk is bright red to <b>reddish</b> <b>orange,</b> and the color gradually loses intensity transforming into pinkish white below. The stalk may be straight, or slightly curved. A gelatinous greenish-brown gleba covers the upper third of the stalk in newly emerged specimens. The remains of the [...] "egg" [...] forms a volva {{around the base of}} the stalk. The odor of the gleba is foul; one author describes it as [...] "sickly sweet or metallic". The spores are a greenish-brown color. Fruit bodies are attached to the substrate by whitish rhizomorphs that resemble plant roots. American mycologist Smith noted that the eggs are often slow to open, sometimes taking up to two weeks before the stalk expands.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} sunny. Over the big desolate {{space of the}} market-place the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened. Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples and piles of <b>reddish</b> <b>oranges,</b> small green-gage plums and bananas. There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed. Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.|$|R

500|$|The cap of M.californiensis is {{initially}} conic or bell-shaped, but flattens out in maturity, and typically reaches dimensions {{of up to}} [...] The cap margins (edges) are curved inwards when young, but as they age they become wavy or [...] (with rounded scallops), develop striations (radial grooves) and may even split. The surface of the cap is dull and smooth. Its color ranges from reddish brown to [...] brownish orange in young specimens, with the color fading as the mushroom matures; {{the center of the}} cap is usually darker than the margins. The flesh is thin, and either the same color as the cap or ligher; it may stain a dark red color when bruised.The gills have an [...] attachment to the stem—broadly attached slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem. They are not closely spaced together, and there are about 15–20 of them. Some of the gills do not extend the full distance {{from the edge of the}} cap to the stem. These short gills, called lamellulae, form one to two groups of roughly equal length. All of the gills have a white to pinkish-buff color, with the gill edges ranging from <b>reddish</b> <b>orange</b> to reddish brown to brownish orange. The hollow stem is [...] long by [...] thick, and roughly the same thickness throughout. The top of the stem may be either [...] (appearing to be covered with a very fine whitish powder on a surface) or smooth, while the stem base is covered with [...] "hairs" [...] that may be strigose (large, coarse, and bristle-like) to [...] (soft and fuzzy). The stem is some shade of brown. The mushroom tissue will [...] "bleed" [...] a brownish-range to reddish-brown latex when it is cut. The edibility of M.californiensis is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|A {{near-shore}} environment {{dominated by}} barrier islands, sand bars and tidal flats later {{returned to the}} region. The sand and silt deposited created the 400 to 900foot (120 to 275m) thick <b>reddish</b> <b>orange</b> Entrada Sandstone. Distinctive jointing systems in the Entrada lead {{to the formation of}} cathedrals and monoliths in Capitol Reef's Cathedral Valley, arches in [...] Arches National Park and 'goblins' (the local name for hoodoos) in nearby Goblin Valley State Park. Entrada exposures {{in the southern part of}} the park are mostly made of flat-bedded siltstones and erode into slopes. Moving north, Entrada exposures increasingly become rich in cross-bedded sandstone and erode into cliffs with fewer and fewer slopes.|$|E
2500|$|Norwood has {{had many}} {{endorsements}} in her career. In 1999, {{she became a}} CoverGirl, appearing {{in a number of}} commercials. She also represented the brands Candie's in 1998 and DKNY in the Spring of 2000. In the late 1990s Norwood was represented by Wilhelmina Agency, one of the leading modeling agencies in the industry. In 1999, Mattell released the Brandy Doll. The doll featured Norwood in a <b>reddish</b> <b>orange</b> blouse and orange long skirt. Next to this, the Holiday Brandy Doll was released in 2000 along with another [...] "Brandy Doll". Millions of the dolls were sold and they were one of the biggest selling toys for Mattel.

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} on the standard black, [...] hockey puck. One {{of the most common}} is a blue, [...] puck that is used for training younger players who are not yet able to use a standard puck. Heavier [...] training pucks, typically reddish pink or <b>reddish</b> <b>orange</b> in colour, are also available for players looking to develop the strength of their shots or improve their stick handling skills. Players looking to increase wrist strength often practice with steel pucks that weigh these pucks are not used for shooting, as they could seriously harm other players. White pucks can be used for goaltender practice. These are regulation size and weight, but made from white rubber. A hollow, light-weight fluorescent orange puck is available for road or floor hockey. Other variants, some with plastic ball bearings or glides, are available for use for road or roller hockey.|$|E
