50|$|Because it {{was unable}} to verify {{the exact number of}} her children, in 1991 Guinness decided <b>to</b> <b>de-list</b> Leontina's record. She died of {{diabetes}} on August 7, 1998. By this time, however, the Chilean authorities had become suspicious of her claims after she had recorded the birth of yet another child in 1995, at the age of 69 (while only three women have ever been recorded as giving birth past the age of 66). A police investigation found that she had actually given birth to only 14 children. The remainder had been recruited from the streets, given to her by poor women, or donated by her cousins. According to police inspector Cristina Rojo, Leontina had perpetrated the fraud to claim food assistance from the Chilean government. She had systematically registered the children in rural civic offices that lacked computerised records, to avoid detection. One of the children was in fact the product of an incestuous relationship between her husband Geraldo and one of the couple's granddaughters. Geraldo, by then probably in his 90s, was said to be a fugitive, while the police were reported to be investigating a number of the couple's other children and relatives for having taken part in the fraud.|$|R

Since 1989 State and federal governments have suggested that counties develop their own manatee protection plans (MPP) and boat facility siting plans (BFSP) where manatees occur (Florida Department of Natural Resources [DNR], 1989; U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS], 1989). In 1989, DNR placed focus on 13 key counties identified as having the most significant impacts on manatee populations. These counties were initially required to develop MPPs and BFSPs. To date, only 14 of the 36 total coastal and inland counties where manatees regularly occur have implemented MPPs and BFSPs which vary from county to county (USFWS, 2011). The development of other county plans has not progressed since 2007. Lack in consistency of protection across inter-jurisdictional boundaries has led to the Florida manatees’ continued presence on the state and federal lists of threatened and endangered species. In effort <b>to</b> <b>de-list</b> this species, a unified BFSP may be developed based on manatee subpopulations.
