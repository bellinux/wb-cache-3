2500|$|She is {{well known}} for her {{signature}} triple-triple jump combinations including triple lutz–triple toe loop, and triple flip–triple toe loop,. [...] She can also execute a triple lutz–double toe loop–double loop jump combination. Another signature jump in her repertoire is a layback Ina Bauer or spread eagle that leads to either a double axel, a double axel–triple toe loop jump combination or a double axel–double toe loop–double loop jump combination - a difficult transition given the required shift in weight and edges. Kim personally stated that her favorite jumps are the lutz, flip and axel. [...] Commentators and analysts consistently refer to her jumps as textbook standard. [...] Her jump techniques are well praised for their high speed entry, height, position and quality of <b>running</b> <b>edges.</b> She has received +2.20 grade of execution for the quality of her jumps.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{method of}} {{continuously}} distributed dislocations model {{is applied to}} the problem of rapidly propagating cracks. Weertman's solution of a <b>running</b> <b>edge</b> dislocation considering the effect of inertia (1961) has been utilized. A semi-infinite length crack running in a strip with clamped sides was analyzed. The singular integral equations representing the boundary condition of this problem were solved numerically by the newly proposed method based on the boundary collocation. The stress intensity factor was calculated and it has been made clear that precise solutions can be obtained even when the number of the collocation points is small. The crack opening displacement was also calculated and a startling result has been obtained. In the neighborhood of the crack tip, the crack opening displacement exceeds the applied displacement between both sides of the strip...|$|R

40|$|In railway applications, track {{alignment}} represents the forming {{curvature of the}} <b>running</b> <b>edge</b> of the rails. During construction, alignment measurements are normally obtained with chord measuring systems. When traditional surveying methods are implemented, {{track alignment}} is taken at sparse spaced points directly from the versine measurement – i. e., the offset observed at an intermediate point from a straight line chord. In contrast, track recording vehicles either apply the chord measuring technique directly or employ a combination of an inertial/gauge sensing system. For ballast track sections, deviations in track alignment from the projected track settlement would raise serious concerns for track buckling. This is because any deviation from the nominal geometry reduces the load needed to induce buckling. Today, modern lining systems and automated maintenance procedures are used to restore track surface and alignment. Contrary to the ballast track technique, the connection of the slab track and the underground is rigid. Consequently, adaptations to the nominal geometry after paving over are only possible with additional expenditure. As a result, positional accuracy requirements in slab track projects are very high...|$|R
