40|$|PURPOSE: This review aims to {{summarise}} the hybrid modality <b>radioguidance</b> techniques currently in clinical use and development, {{and to discuss}} possible future avenues of research. Due to the novelty of these approaches, evidence of their clinical relevance does not yet exist. The purpose of this review is to inform nuclear medicine practitioners of current cutting edge research in radioguided surgery which may enter standard clinical practice within the next 5 - 10  years. Hybrid imaging is of growing importance to nuclear medicine diagnostics, {{but it is only}} with recent advances in technology that hybrid modalities are being investigated for use during radioguided surgery. These modalities aim to overcome some of the difficulties of surgical imaging while maintaining many benefits, or providing entirely new information unavailable to surgeons with traditional <b>radioguidance.</b> METHODS: A literature review was carried out using online reference databases (Scopus, PubMed). Review articles obtained using this technique were citation mined to obtain further references. RESULTS: In total, 2367 papers were returned, with 425 suitable for further assessment. 60 papers directly related to hybrid intraoperative imaging in radioguided surgery are reported on. Of these papers, 25 described the clinical use of hybrid imaging, 22 described the development of new hybrid probes and tracers, and 13 described the development of hybrid technologies for future clinical use. Hybrid gamma-NIR fluorescence was found to be the most common clinical technique, with 35 papers associated with these modalities. Other hybrid combinations include gamma-bright field imaging, gamma-ultrasound imaging, gamma-β imaging and β-OCT imaging. The combination of preoperative and intraoperative images is also discussed. CONCLUSION: Hybrid imaging offers new possibilities for assisting clinicians and surgeons in localising the site of uptake in procedures such as in sentinel node detection.

30|$|With the {{upcoming}} field of image-guided surgery, not only traditional 99 mTc- and 111 In-labelled <b>radioguidance</b> procedures blossom, {{but also the}} development of fluorescent and hybrid/bimodal tracers gains increasing interest. While converting efficient 68 Ga-PET tracers for e.g. Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen to 99 mTc- labeled versions for radioguided surgery (Robu et al., 2017) is already part of the traditional radiochemistry skillset, attachment of fluorescent dyes as imaging labels requires additional expertise. Surprisingly, it is not fully recognized yet which modifications can be induced {{by the addition of}} fluorescent dyes, e.g. alterations in biodistribution, and manuscripts seldomly report the key analytical features required to objectively analyze them. In this editorial we aim to discuss a number of factors to be taken into consideration when fluorescent dyes are used in in vivo imaging tracers.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Our aim was {{to assess}} the {{feasibility}} of intraoperative <b>radioguidance</b> with a portable gamma camera during laparoscopic sentinel node (SN) procedures in urological malignancies. METHODS: We evaluated the use of the intraoperative portable gamma camera in 20 patients: 16 patients with prostate carcinoma (PCC), 2 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RC) and 2 patients with testicular cancer (TC). Intra/peritumoural injection of (99 m) Tc-nanocolloid ((99 m) Tc) was followed by planar lymphoscintigraphy, SPECT/CT and marking of SN levels. Before laparoscopy a (125) I seed was fixed on the laparoscopic gamma probe as a pointer of SN seeking. The portable gamma camera was set to display the (99 m) Tc signal for SN localisation and the (125) I signal for SN seeking. Matching of these signals on screen indicated exact SN localisation, and consequently this SN was removed. RESULTS: The mean injected dose was 218 MBq in PCC, 228 MBq in RC and 88 MBq in TC. Pelvic SN were visualised in all PCC patients, with uncommonly located SN in seven patients. SN metastases were found in seven patients (one in a uncommonly located SN). Both RC patients and TC patients had para-aortic SN, which were all tumour free. A total of 59 SN were removed. The portable gamma camera enabled real-time SN display/identification in 18 patients (90 %). CONCLUSION: The use of a portable gamma camera in combination with a laparoscopic gamma probe incorporates intraoperative real-time imaging with improved SN identification in urological malignancies. This procedure might also be useful for SN identification of other deep draining malignancie...|$|E
40|$|Paraaortic {{sentinel}} node biopsy may be {{a challenging}} procedure because the sentinel nodes are located retroperitoneally {{in close proximity to}} vital structures. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe and evaluate the value of preoperative SPECT/CT for lymphatic mapping, and a portable gamma-camera for intraoperative <b>radioguidance,</b> in patients with paraaortic sentinel nodes. METHODS: We evaluated our practice in 18 patients, who were treated at The Netherlands Cancer Institute with sentinel lymphadenectomy for different urologic malignancies and showed paraaortic drainage on preoperative images. After intratumoral injection of (99 m) Tc-nanocolloid, the patients underwent sequential planar lymphoscintigraphy, hybrid SPECT/CT, and sentinel lymphadenectomy. Intraoperative node detection and localization were guided by a laparoscopic gamma-probe and a portable gamma-camera. This gamma-camera was set to display both the (99 m) Tc signal and the (125) I-seed signal. This (125) I seed was placed on top of the gamma-probe, functioning as a pointer on screen, thus enabling real-time sentinel node localization with the gamma-camera. RESULTS: In 16 patients with midabdominal drainage on planar images and in 2 patients with nonvisualization on planar images, SPECT/CT showed clear localization of paraaortic sentinel nodes in relation to the abdominal vessels. Five patients underwent open surgery, and 13 patients underwent laparoscopy. The paraaortic sentinel nodes were successfully localized and removed in 15 patients with the help of the portable gamma-camera and gamma-probe and in 3 patients with the gamma-probe only. In 1 patient, the paraaortic sentinel node showed a metastasis. CONCLUSION: If retroperitoneal drainage is expected, SPECT/CT provides good detection and clear localization of sentinel nodes in relation to anatomic structures. Detection and removal of paraaortic sentinel nodes by means of a laparoscopic gamma-probe and real-time imaging with a portable gamma-camera is a successful method with high intraoperative detection rate...|$|E
40|$|Background: Primary {{hyperparathyroidism}} (PHPT) {{is caused}} inmost cases {{by a single}} adenoma. The development of new techniques – such as intraoperative <b>radioguidance</b> and quick measurement of PTH (qPTH) – prompted ‘focused’ parathyroidectomy. Candidates must be selected {{by one or more}} preoperative imaging studies. The success of operation is then confirmed intraoperatively, using serial qPTH determinations. In this study we evaluated the probability that a patient with PHPT, with both MIBI scan and ultrasonography showing one, single abnormal focus, has uniglandular disease. Methods: Among patients with PHPT referred for first operation to theDay Surgery Unit,Department of Surgery, University of Pisa (October 2001 to October 2002), we selected those in whom MIBI scan and ultrasonography were available, and indicated the presence of the same, single lesion. qPTH was used whenever available and early judgement of cure was made according to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium levels obtained the morning after the operation, and it was verified at follow-up. We calculated the positive predictive value (PPV) of MIBI and ultrasonography taken as a single test for the diagnosis of single adenoma by the formulaPPV = a/a + b, with a being the true positives (normocalcaemia at follow-up) and b the false positives (hypercalcaemia at follow-up). Results: Some 103 patients with PHPT underwent first operation during the 13 months. Preoperative MIBI scan and ultrasonography were available for 85 of them, and showed the same abnormality in 52 cases (61 per cent). The image always coincided with a histologically confirmed parathyroid adenoma, and qPTH dropped significantly after its removal. The morning after the operation PTH was normal in 51 subjects. At followup all but one patient were normocalcaemic. The PPV of ultrasonography–scintigraphy (as a single test) for the diagnosis of single-gland disease was 98 per cent. We also registered three cases of slightly elevated PTH in normocalcaemic subjects, in whom a definite judgement of cure was controversial. Conclusion: If we use high-frequency ultrasonography and MIBI scintigraphy as a single test, evidence of a sole abnormality is highly predictive of uniglandular disease; the coupled study is an accurate tool for the selection of candidates in a focused surgical approach for PHPT...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{sentinel}} {{lymph node biopsy}} in breast cancer surgery relates {{to the fact that}} the tumor drains in a logical way via the lymphatic system, from the first to upper levels. Therefore, (1) the first lymph node met (the sentinel node) will most likely be the first one affected by metastasis, and (2) a negative sentinel node makes it highly unlikely that other nodes are affected. Sentinel lymph node biopsy would represent a significant advantage as a mini-invasive procedure, considering that, after operation, about 70 % of patients are found to be free from metastatic disease, yet axillary node dissection can lead to significant morbidity. Although the pattern of lymphatic drainage from a breast cancer can be very variable, the mammary gland and the overlying skin can be considered as a biologic unit in which lymphatics tend to follow the vasculature. Considering that tumor lymphatics are disorganized and relatively ineffective, subdermal, and peritumoral injection of small aliquots of radiotracer is preferred to intratumoral administration. (99 m) Tc-labeled colloids with most of the particles in the 100 - 200 nm size range would be ideal for radioguided sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer. Lymphoscintigraphy is an essential part of radioguided sentinel lymph node biopsy, as images are used to direct the surgeon to the site of the node. The sentinel lymph node should have a significantly higher count than background. After removal of the sentinel node, the axilla must be re-examined to ensure all radioactive sites are identified and removed for analysis. The success rate of <b>radioguidance</b> in localizing the sentinel lymph node in breast cancer surgery is about 94 - 97 % in Institutions where a high number of procedures are performed, approaching 99 % when combined with the vital blue dye technique. At present, there is no definite evidence that a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy is invariably correlated with a negative axillary status, except perhaps for T(1 a-b) breast cancers, with size < or = 1 cm. Randomized clinical trials should elucidate the impact of avoiding axillary node dissection in patients with a negative sentinel lymph node on the long-term clinical outcome of patients...|$|E
40|$|As {{for other}} solid tumors, {{malignant}} cutaneous melanoma drains in a logical {{way through the}} lymphatic system, from the first to subsequent levels. Therefore, the first lymph node encountered (the sentinel node) {{will most likely be}} the first to be affected by metastasis, and a negative sentinel node makes it highly unlikely that other nodes in the same lymphatic basin are affected. Sentinel lymph node biopsy distinguishes patients without nodal metastases, who can avoid nodal basin dissection with its associated risk of lymphedema, and those with metastatic involvement who might benefit from additional therapy. This procedure represents a significant advantage as a minimally invasive procedure, considering that only an average 20 % of melanoma patients with Breslow thickness between 1. 5 and 4 mm harbour metastasis in their sentinel node(s) and are therefore candidates to elective lymph node dissection procedures. The cells that originate cutaneous melanomas are located between dermis and epidermis, a zone that drains to the inner lymphatic network in the reticular dermis, in turn to larger collecting lymphatics in subcutis. Therefore, the optimal modality of interstitial administration of radiocolloids for lymphoscintigraphy and subsequent radioguided sentinel lymph node biopsy is through intradermal/subdermal injection. (99 m) Tc-labeled colloids in various size ranges are equally adequate for radioguided sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with cutaneous melanoma, depending on local experience and availability. For melanomas located in the midline area of the head, neck, and trunk, particular consideration should be given to ambiguous lymphatic drainage, which frequently requires interstitial administration virtually all around the tumor or surgical scar from prior excision of the melanoma. Lymphoscintigraphy {{is an essential part of}} radioguided sentinel lymph node biopsy because images are used to direct the surgeon to the sites of the node(s). The sentinel lymph node should have a significantly higher count than that of background (at least 10 : 1 intraoperatively). After removal of the sentinel node, the surgical bed must be reexamined to ensure that all radioactive sites are identified and removed for analysis. The success rate of <b>radioguidance</b> in localizing the sentinel lymph node in melanoma patients is about 98 % in institutions where a high number of procedures are performed, approaching 99 % when combined with the vital blue dye technique. The procedure is becoming the standard of care for patients with cutaneous melanoma because of its high prognostic value that has led to include the procedure in the most recent version of the TNM staging system...|$|E
40|$|The {{procedure}} of sentinel {{lymph node biopsy}} in patients with malignant cutaneous melanoma has evolved from {{the notion that the}} tumor drains in a logical way through the lymphatic system, from the first to subsequent levels. As a consequence, the first lymph node encountered (the sentinel node) will most likely be the first affected by metastasis; therefore, a negative sentinel node makes it highly unlikely that other nodes in the same lymphatic basin are affected. Although the long-term therapeutic benefit of the sentinel lymph node biopsy per se has not yet been ascertained, this procedure distinguishes patients without nodal metastases, who can avoid nodal basin dissection with its associated risk of lymphedema, from those with metastatic involvement, who may benefit from additional therapy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy would represent a significant advantage as a minimally invasive procedure, considering that an average of only 20 % of melanoma patients with a Breslow thickness between 1. 5 and 4 mm harbor metastasis in their sentinel node and are therefore candidates for elective lymph node dissection. Furthermore, histologic sampling errors (amounting to approximately 12 % of lymph nodes in the conventional routine) can be reduced if one assesses a single (sentinel) node extensively rather than assessing the standard few histologic sections in a high number of lymph nodes per patient. The cells from which cutaneous melanomas originate are located between the dermis and the epidermis, a zone that drains to the inner lymphatic network in the reticular dermis and, in turn, to larger collecting lymphatics in the subcutis. Therefore, the optimal route for interstitial administration of radiocolloids for lymphoscintigraphy and subsequent radioguided sentinel lymph node biopsy is intradermal or subdermal injection.

Virtually the entire sentinel lymph node should be processed for histopathology, including both conventional hematoxylin-eosin staining and immune staining with antibodies to the S- 100 and HMB- 45 antigens. The success rate of <b>radioguidance</b> in localizing the sentinel lymph node in melanoma patients is approximately 98 % in institutions that perform a high number of procedures and approaches 99 % when combined with the vital blue-dye technique. Growing evidence of the high correlation between a sentinel lymph node biopsy negative for cancer and a negative status for the lymphatic basin-evidence, therefore, of the high prognostic value of sentinel node biopsy-has led to the procedure's being included in the most recent version of the TNM staging system and starting to become the standard of care for patients with cutaneous melanoma...|$|E
