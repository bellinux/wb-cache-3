30|$|Built {{environment}} features do {{not appear}} to correlate with vehicle ownership, but do have an impact on mode preferences. Specifically, employees working in locations of higher population density, greater mixed land use and higher road intersection densities have higher income. These richer people have greater propensities to ride <b>rail</b> <b>transits</b> and plan to purchase cars. Additionally, a longer distance to access railway stations discourages riding <b>rail</b> <b>transits</b> or purchasing <b>cars</b> because their income is relatively low. These conclusions on the intention of riding <b>rail</b> <b>transits</b> are consistent with similar research done in the E.U. and U.S., but differ in terms of intention of car purchasing. These differences are largely due to contextual differences between China, E.U. and U.S. In China, people working in compact developed areas benefit from higher incomes, and as such are more flexible in their choice of home and transportation modes. In addition, most Chinese households only own one car which enables the head of a household to drive, while other members access alternative modes. Wealthier households have the privilege of using <b>cars</b> and <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> simultaneously [10].|$|R
40|$|Modern {{electric}} motors for road electric vehicles (automobiles, scooters, bicycles), light <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> (street <b>cars,</b> trolley lines, subway trains), guided transit systems and elevators have been discussed. The paper aims at {{various types of}} rotary brushless motors, direct electromechanical drives and practical solutions to light traction systems. Modern permanent magnet (PM) motor technologies offer diversity of cutting-edge technology brushless motors, i. e., motors with one slot coil pitch windings, transverse flux motors, coreless disc type motors and PM assisted synchronous reluctance motors. There is a wide interest in liquid cooled traction motors and inverters as those apparatus minimize the volume of electromechanical drive systems and increase their power density. Frequently, the traction motor for road vehicles is integrated with a solid state converter. Light traction with linear motors has not been considered.

In this vein, we apply the structural equations modeling approach on 597 residents who moved into the Hiawatha light <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> (LRT) corridor after it opened. Using a quasi-longitudinal design to compare the behavior of movers into the Hiawatha and control corridors, we found that the Hiawatha LRT acts as both a catalyst and a magnet. Movers into the Hiawatha corridor experience transit improvement, which increases transit use and reduces car use. The LRT also enables transit-liking people who were unable to realize their preference previously to relocate near the LRT. However, the LRT has no significant effects on changes in auto ownership. This suggests that besides transit infrastructure, planners should promote transit-friendly neighborhood characteristics...|$|R

Based on this analysis, ten major trends of development in China’s urban <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> over 2016 – 2020 were forecasted. Over 2016 – 2020, with the development of urbanization, approximately 100 million people will migrate to the cities and nearly 100 million new vehicles will be added on the roads. Urban development also requires a substantial increase in the proportion of travels by public transport, while 40 cities have ongoing urban <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> projects and 80 cities are planning to construct urban <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> systems. The joint effect of the five forces could facilitate a larger-scale development of urban <b>rail</b> <b>transit.</b> The relaxation of policies related to urban household registration, development of urban agglomerations and metropolitan areas, and construction of state-level new areas will generate an immense demand for the development of coordinated, multimodal urban <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> systems.
