40|$|Abstract. A 5 -month-old minature Poodle dog had {{widespread}} cytoplasmic vacuolation {{of neurons}} {{in the central}} nervous system and foamy macrophages in the lung, spleen, renal lymph node, liver, adrenal gland and intestine. Concentric membranous cytoplasmic inclusions were seen in the neurons of {{the central nervous system}} by electron microscopy. There was no sphingomyelinase in the brain tissue. Sphingomyelin and cholesterol were increased in brain, kidney and liver. A diagnosis of Niemann-Pick Disease was based on absence of sphingomye-linase activity, as well as on histologic, histochemical and chemical findings. Niemann-Pick Disease is the result of an autosomal recessive genetic mutation [3, 4, 221 and consequent absence of sphingomyelinase [4, 131, which leads to accumu-lation of sphingomyelin and cholesterol in the central nervous and <b>reticuloendothelial</b> <b>systems.</b> Reports of lipid storage disease in companion animals include glucocerebrosidosis [1 I], phosphatidosis [lo], gangliosidosis [14, 15, 241 and ceroidlipofuscinosis [171 in the dog; spingomyelinosis [6, 221 and ceroidlipofuscinosis [9] and gangliosidosis [7] in the cat; and cholesterosis in parakeets [191.

Three-way analysis of variance indicated that the bacterial flora, {{the presence or absence}} of a thymus, and the route of agent inoculation interact to produce significant differences in the pathogenesis of disease. The three factors in the experimental design also influenced the spleen titers of scrapie infectivity.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{diagnosis}} of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasingly demanded to imaging techniques. Anyway, imaging cirrhotic patients still remains a challenging issue, since pre-neoplastic hepatocellular lesions, as dysplastic nodules (DNs), may frequently mimic small neoplasms. Differently from other imaging modalities, magnetic resonance (MR) can give an accurate evaluation of both intracellular and vascular changes occurring during the carcinogenetic pathway from dysplasia to full malignancy. Both DNs and HCC may in fact show a large variety of signal intensities, strictly reflecting nodules' characteristics, such as lesion architecture, grading, stromal components, as well as intracellular contents.

40|$|Mastocytosis is a {{rare disease}} of mast-cell {{proliferation}} with involvement of the <b>reticuloendothelial</b> <b>systems</b> including skin, bone, gastrointestinal tract, liver, lungs, spleen, and lymph nodes. Systemic mastocytosis {{is characterized by a}} combination of symptoms that relate to the mast cells' release of vasoactive substances, such as histamine. These symptoms include urticaria pigmentosa, flushing, syncope with hypotension, headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and occasional bronchospasm. The diagnosis of mastocytosis is typically based on the presence of the characteristic extraosseus manifestations. A well recognized roentgenographic feature seen in 70 - 75 % of patients with mastocytosis is diffuse osteolysis and osteosclerosis, affecting primarily the axial skeleton and the ends of the long bones. Rarely, the bony involvement consists of generalized osteoporosis, which may lead to pathologic fracture, or solitary lesions (mastocytomas) which may cause symptoms of localized pain. Four patients with previously diagnosed systemic mastocytosis had unusual skeletal lesions. Clinical and laboratory evaluation of these patients eventually led to the correct diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis. We report these four cases to emphasize the need for thorough evaluation of unusual musculoskeletal findings in association with extraosseus symptoms that are characteristic of mastocytosis.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} exhibit many unique intrinsic {{physical and}} chemical properties and have been intensively explored for biological and biomedical applications. In this review, we summarize the main results of our and other groups in this field and clarify that surface functionalization is critical to the behaviors of carbon nanotubes in biological systems. Ultra-sensitive detection of biological species with carbon nanotubes can be realized after surface passivation to inhibit the non-specific binding of bio-molecules on the hydrophobic nanotube surface. Electrical nanosensors based on nanotubes provide a label-free approach to biological detections. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy of CNT opens up a method of protein microarray with down to 1 fM detection sensitivity. In vitro and in vivo toxicity studies reveal that well water soluble and serum stable nanotubes are biocompatible, non-toxic and potentially useful for biomedical applications. In vivo biodistributions vary with the functionalization and possibly also sizes of nanotubes, with a tendency of accumulation in the <b>reticuloendothelial</b> <b>systems,</b> including the liver and spleen, after intravenous administration. If well functionalized, nanotubes may be excreted mainly through the biliary pathway in feces. Carbon nanotube-based drug delivery has shown promises in various in vitro and in vivo experiments including delivery pf small interfering RNA, paclitaxel and doxorubicin. Moreover, SWNTs with various interesting intrinsic optical properties have been used as novel photoluminance, Raman and photoacoustic contrast agents for imaging of cells and animals. Further multidisciplinary explorations in this field are promising and may bring new opportunities to the realm of biomedicine. Comment: To appear in Nano Research, [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Ebola virus, {{a member}} of the family Filoviridae, causes one of the most severe forms of viral hemorrhagic fever. In the {{terminal}} stages of disease, symptoms progress to hypotension, coagulation disorders, and hemorrhages, and there is prominent involvement of the mononuclear phagocytic and <b>reticuloendothelial</b> <b>systems.</b> Cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system are primary target cells and producers of inflammatory mediators. Ebola virus efficiently produces four soluble glycoproteins during infection: sGP, delta peptide (Δ-peptide), GP 1, and GP 1, 2 Δ. While the presence of these glycoproteins has been confirmed in blood (sGP) and in vitro systems, it is hypothesized that they are of biological relevance in pathogenesis, particularly target cell activation. To gain insight into their function, we expressed the four soluble glycoproteins in mammalian cells and purified and characterized them. The role of the transmembrane glycoprotein in the context of virus-like particles was also investigated. Primary human macrophages were treated with glycoproteins and virus-like particles and subsequently tested for activation by detection of several critical proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin- 6 [IL- 6], and IL- 1 beta) and the chemokine IL- 8. The presentation of the glycoprotein was determined to be critical since virus-like particles, but not soluble glycoproteins, induced high levels of activation. We propose that the presentation of GP 1, 2 in the rigid form such as that observed on the surface of particles is critical for initiating a sufficient signal for the activation of primary target cells. The secreted glycoproteins do not appear to play any role in exogenous activation of these cells during Ebola virus infection...|$|R
