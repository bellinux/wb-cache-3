5|$|This contradicted Wright's earlier {{statement}} when stopped by {{police in the}} district {{in the early hours}} of the morning: he implied he was unaware he was in the <b>red</b> <b>light</b> district and was driving around because he could not sleep. Wright's rented flat was located in the <b>red</b> <b>light</b> area.|$|E
5|$|The Essex Reef Light {{was first}} lit on July 1, 1889, it {{featured}} a fixed <b>red</b> <b>light</b> until December 15, 1892, {{when it was}} changed to a fixed white light.|$|E
5|$|As the sun, the Eye of Ra is {{a source}} of heat and light, and it is {{associated}} with fire and flames. It is also equated with the <b>red</b> <b>light</b> that appears before sunrise, and with the morning star that precedes and signals the sun's arrival.|$|E
50|$|The {{ratio of}} white to <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> seen is {{dependent}} on the angle of approach to the runway. Above the designated glide slope a pilot will observe more white <b>lights</b> than <b>red,</b> at approaches below the ideal angle more <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> than white will be seen. For the optimum approach angle the ratio of white to <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> will remain equal throughout.|$|R
50|$|A {{substantial}} {{change in}} the new Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China is a new requirement which forces drivers to stop at <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> {{even if there is}} a crossing only to the left (no crossing to the right), thereby outlawing straight-ahead at <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> that was permitted at an intersection with no crossing to the right. Drivers, however, still can turn right at <b>red</b> <b>lights,</b> unless signs prohibit this.|$|R
40|$|Red {{warning lights}} {{delineate}} the runway approach with additional blue lights juxtaposed with the <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> {{such that the}} <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> are chromatically balanced. The red/blue point light sources result in the phenomenon that the <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> appear {{in front of the}} blue lights with about one and one-half times the diameter of the blue. To a pilot observing these lights along a glide path, those <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> directly below appear to be nearer than the blue lights. For those lights farther away seen in perspective at oblique angles, the <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> appear {{to be in a position}} closer to the pilot and hence appear to be above the corresponding blue lights. This produces a very pronounced three dimensional effect referred to as chromostereopsis which provides valuable visual cues to enable the pilot to perceive his actual position above the ground and the actual distance to the runway...|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{publication}} of the journal, Covent Garden, although formally associated with the theatre industry, was more widely known as London's <b>red</b> <b>light</b> district. Fielding had earlier written The Covent Garden Tragedy, a mock-tragic play concerning the tale of two prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Frank {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts House of Representatives where he served for eight years. He {{made a name for himself}} in the mid-1970s as a {{political}} defender of the Combat Zone, Boston’s notorious <b>red</b> <b>light</b> district. Neighborhoods in Frank’s district bordered the Combat Zone. As a means of dealing with crime in the area (including violence, police corruption and the infiltration by organized crime), he introduced a bill into the Massachusetts General Court that would have legalized the sex-for-hire business but kept it quarantined in a <b>red</b> <b>light</b> district, which would have been moved to Boston’s Financial District. The bill, which had the support of Boston’s Police Commissioner, never came up for a vote. Later, when Frank was running for Congress, opponents erroneously portrayed him as having attempted to permit red-light districts in all Bay State communities.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 and 2001, Flytoget {{experienced}} three derailments {{with empty}} trains at Gardermoen; one {{caused by the}} engineer falling asleep and two by the train passing a <b>red</b> <b>light.</b> No more such accidents occurred after Automatic Train Control was installed in 2001.|$|E
25|$|In Washington State, and Texas, <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> {{are used}} on tow trucks, {{but only if}} the vehicle is not in motion. Most tow trucks mount {{rear-facing}} <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> to be used in sync with the vehicle's normal stop lights.|$|R
50|$|Belgium has no {{specific}} regulations concerning sirens and lights on police vehicles, although the law doesn't allow {{the use of}} <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> pointing forwards, therefore all emergency vehicles may only be equipped with blue <b>lights</b> (<b>red</b> <b>lights</b> are allowed on the rear side).|$|R

5|$|Ryan was {{involved}} in a three-car crash in eastern Pennsylvania on January 14, 2013. A witness said Ryan ran his Ford Mustang through a <b>red</b> <b>light</b> and collided with another driver which caused the unidentified driver to hit a third car. Ryan was issued a warning, but no citation.|$|E
5|$|The {{light was}} {{automated}} in 1979. Today, the lighthouse displays an occulting <b>red</b> <b>light</b> with a four-second period, having a nominal range of 12 nautical miles. During the navigation season {{that runs from}} April 1 to November 1, the fog signal sounds a two-second blast every fifteen seconds.|$|E
5|$|While most marine {{bioluminescence}} {{is green}} to blue, some deep sea barbeled dragonfishes in the genera Aristostomias, Pachystomias and Malacosteus emit a red glow. This adaptation allows {{the fish to}} see red-pigmented prey, which are normally invisible in the deep ocean environment where <b>red</b> <b>light</b> has been filtered out by the water column.|$|E

5|$|As {{well as the}} {{disputes}} over the refereeing, the goal judges on several occasions did not turn on the <b>red</b> <b>light</b> indicating a goal after a Canadian score. After Henderson's goal in game seven, Sinden sent the entire team off the bench to ensure the goal was counted. A similar incident during game eight led to the melee that Eagleson was involved in.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) ions shows two sharp {{fluorescence}} peaks at 652nanometers (<b>red</b> <b>light)</b> and 742nanometers (deep red – near infrared) due {{to internal}} transitions at the f-electron shell. The relative intensity of these peaks {{depends on the}} excitation power and temperature of the sample. This emission can be observed, for example, after dispersing berkelium ions in a silicate glass, by melting the glass in presence of berkelium oxide or halide.|$|E
5|$|In the end, four {{broadband}} filters were chosen, centred at wavelengths of 300 nm (near-ultraviolet), 450nm (blue light), 606nm (<b>red</b> <b>light)</b> and 814nm (near-infrared). Because the quantum efficiency of Hubble's detectors is quite low at 300nm, the noise in observations at this wavelength is {{primarily due to}} CCD noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.|$|E

5|$|More than 20 other {{minerals}} have higher dispersion (that is difference in refractive index for blue and <b>red</b> <b>light)</b> than diamond, such as titanite 0.051, andradite 0.057, cassiterite 0.071, strontium titanate 0.109, sphalerite 0.156, synthetic rutile 0.330, cinnabar 0.4, etc. (see dispersion). However, {{the combination of}} dispersion with extreme hardness, wear and chemical resistivity, as well as clever marketing, determines the exceptional value of diamond as a gemstone.|$|E
5|$|Neon gives a {{distinct}} reddish-orange glow {{when used in}} low-voltage neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes and neon advertising signs. The red emission line from neon also causes the well known <b>red</b> <b>light</b> of helium–neon lasers. Neon is used in some plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses. It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Since air is the only source, it is considerably more expensive than helium.|$|E
5|$|Samarium-doped calcium {{fluoride}} crystals {{were used as}} an active medium {{in one of the}} first solid-state lasers designed and constructed by Peter Sorokin (co-inventor of the dye laser) and Mirek Stevenson at IBM research labs in early 1961. This samarium laser emitted pulses of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> at 708.5nm. It had to be cooled by liquid helium and thus did not find practical applications.|$|E

5|$|Simpson {{immersed}} {{himself in}} the world of cycling, writing letters asking for advice. Naturalised Austrian rider George Berger responded, travelling from London to Harworth to help him with his riding position. In late 1955, Simpson ran a <b>red</b> <b>light</b> in a race and was suspended from racing for six months by the BLRC. During his suspension he dabbled in motorcycle trials, nearly quitting cycling but unable to afford a new motorcycle necessary for progress in the sport.|$|E
5|$|Solid xenon {{changes from}} face-centered cubic (fcc) to {{hexagonal}} close packed (hcp) crystal phase under pressure and begins to turn metallic at about 140GPa, with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase. It is completely metallic at 155GPa. When metallized, xenon appears sky blue because it absorbs <b>red</b> <b>light</b> and transmits other visible frequencies. Such behavior is unusual for a metal and is explained by the relatively small width of the electron bands in that state.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{on the day}} of the shooting, Loughner {{reportedly}} had an altercation {{with his}} father regarding a black bag the younger man took from a car trunk. A bag matching the description was later found in a nearby desert area containing 9mm ammunition, and it is believed to belong to Loughner. Later that morning, at approximately 7:30a.m., Loughner was stopped by an Arizona Game and Fish Department officer after running a <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> but was released with a reminder when it was determined that he did not have any outstanding warrants.|$|E
