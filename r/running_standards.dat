50|$|Leaving {{the north}} side of the Forth Bridge, trains would reach Inverkeithing over the {{approach}} railway, and then Touch Junctions at Dunfermline by the 1866 line. Joining the Dunfermline branch of the old EP&DR company, trains could run eastwards for a few miles before running on to another section of new route at Cowdenbeath giving access at Kelty South Junction to the old Kinross-shire Railway. The route then continued through Kinross on to the Fife and Kinross-shire line, diverging at Mawcarse on to the new Glenfarg route, and thence to Perth. All this was double track, and the relevant sections of the Kinross railways, which had been quiet backwaters, were doubled and upgraded to main line <b>running</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E

50|$|The North British {{wanted to}} {{incorporate}} Perth into its network. There were already the Kinross lines, built independently by the Fife and Kinross Railway and the Kinross-shire Railway. These {{had been built}} as country branch lines with a dominant mineral traffic at the southern end, {{and they were not}} laid out for main line running. The North British was upgrading them to double track and main line <b>running</b> <b>standards.</b> The entry to towards Kinross from the south was particularly tortuous, curving off the Dunfermline to Thornton line sharply at Lumphinnans. A new line was being built improving the access, from south of Cowdenbeath, with a new Cowdenbeath station on the new line, and running to Kelty. The descent from Cowdenbeath to Kelty had long been subjected to mining subsidence, and much work had to be done to prepare the line for main line standards. In fact in the following years much work was necessary to keep the line fit.|$|E
