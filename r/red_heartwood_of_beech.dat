40|$|In {{our study}} beech (Fagus silvatica L.) samples {{containing}} {{white and red}} heartwood were steamed to obtain colour homogenisation. Wide range of steaming temperatures (80 - 120 degrees C) was applied for wet (47 %), semi-wet (28 %) and dry (8 %) samples. All temperature values were effective in minimising the colour difference between white and <b>red</b> <b>heartwood</b> <b>of</b> <b>beech.</b> Below 100 degrees C the colour change was similar irrespective of the temperature value.

The initial moisture content had no effect on the colour change if it was above the fibre saturation point. The colour shift was less intensive in the case of initially dry samples than in the case of wet samples. Colour homogenisation of beech wood by steaming below 100 degrees C is not recommended if the timber is initially dry...|$|E
40|$|Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is {{the most}} {{important}} deciduous tree species in Germany. The wood <b>of</b> <b>beech</b> shows normally a bright colour (white beech) as long as no coloured heartwood has been formed. The facultative heartwood formation is induced when oxygen enters central parts of older trees, where dead or at least less vital parenchyma exist. The coloured heartwood is usually called ‘red heartwood’. Beech without <b>red</b> <b>heartwood</b> can preferably be found in younger trees which show a high water content even in central parts of the stem. The presence <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>heartwood</b> is regarded as a severe reduction of timber quality. Numerous studies have investigated opportunities to derive information on the presence and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>heartwood</b> <b>of</b> standing <b>beech</b> trees. But until now it has not been tested whether such information could be helpful to improve the econom-ics of beech-silviculture.

40|$|The goal of {{this word}} {{was to examine the}} {{parameters}} <b>of</b> color <b>of</b> <b>beech</b> wood before and after thermal treatment, and to determine if there is a difference in color between sapwood and <b>red</b> <b>heartwood</b> before and after application of high temperature. Samples were treated at temperatures of 170 °C, 190 °C and 210 °C, respectively, during 4 hours. Color coordinates (CIEL*a*b* system) were measured before and after treatment by using the following parameters: ΔL, Δa, Δb and ΔE - color change. Color was assessed at four spots on the radial and cross-section surfaces of wood and their mean values were taken for further calculations. Acquired results show that the applied heat treatment of sapwood did not significantly influence the change of color difference between cross-section and radial surfaces. The difference between cross-section and radial surfaces, in nontreated <b>red</b> <b>heartwood</b> was smaller than that measured in sapwood. The color difference of nontreated sapwood and <b>red</b> <b>heartwood</b> was more pronounced on the radial than on the cross-section surface. Application of high temperature caused a significant decrease of this difference. Temperature of 210 °C caused the smallest color difference between these two parts of wood which was in this research determined on the radial surface. It was concluded that the applied thermal treatment almost equalized the colors <b>of</b> sapwood and <b>red</b> <b>heartwood,</b> especially on the radial surface, and from this aspect it can be concluded that these two parts <b>of</b> <b>beech</b> wood were completely equalized.

30|$|This is {{the first}} report to {{ascertain}} potassium location in black <b>heartwood</b> <b>of</b> sugi (Cryptomeria japonica). The objective {{of this study was}} to understand the distribution of potassium in sugi black heartwood in connection with anatomical morphology. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDXA) was used to investigate the distribution of inorganic elements, especially potassium. In black heartwood, potassium was detected in all tissues (tracheids, ray parenchyma, and axial parenchyma), but its concentrations were different in each xylem tissue. Potassium was particularly accumulated in the droplets in axial parenchyma cells. In addition, calcium was also detected in all tissues. Phosphorus sometimes existed in the granules in ray parenchyma cells. From optical microscopy, the axial parenchyma cells were observed to be arranged in a tangential direction on transverse section and the droplets in these cells were distributed in areas of high ash and green moisture content. For <b>red</b> <b>heartwood,</b> potassium detected by SEM-EDXA was far lower in all tissues than in the black heartwood, while the trend for calcium was the converse. Potassium in axial parenchyma cells was more abundant in black heartwood than in typical pale <b>red</b> <b>heartwood.</b>|$|R

30|$|California {{coast redwood}} (Sequoia sempervirens (D.Don) Endl.) {{is a native}} of the fog belt that extends from {{southwest}} Oregon to central California on the Pacific coast of North America. Some specimens are among the tallest living plants in the world, reaching more than 100 m. “Old growth” redwood timber has been highly prized for several unique features. The sapwood is white, but the stem consists mainly <b>of</b> dark <b>red</b> <b>heartwood</b> with very straight grain, low shrinkage, high dimensional stability and good resistance to warping. As one of the most dimensionally stable of the western softwoods, redwood is resistant to checking and splitting, and is therefore less affected by weather than most softwood species. It has been widely used for outdoor decorative purposes (decking and cladding). All heartwood timber grades are considered to be more durable and insect resistant than <b>heartwood</b> <b>of</b> other softwood species, yet the wood is lightweight and exceptionally stable. According to reports from the USDA Forest Products Laboratory (USDA 1999), old-growth redwood is less subject to dimensional shrinkage than other common domestic softwoods.|$|R
30|$|The {{specimens}} {{used were}} <b>heartwood</b> <b>of</b> Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica, hereafter, cedar), <b>heartwood</b> <b>of</b> Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi, hereafter, larch), and beech (Fagus crenata). From these woods, straight grain test specimens of 12  mm (L) ×  6  mm (T) ×  70  mm (R) were prepared [with the exception <b>of</b> the <b>beech,</b> which was 4  mm (T)]. The partial density variation of cedar and larch is large {{because of the}} effect of annual rings. All machining was conducted on early wood: density was measured for each segment of early wood cut out, with the air-dried density of the cedar and larch being 0.31 and 0.35  g/cm 3, respectively. The machining area was not limited for the beech, and the air-dried density <b>of</b> the <b>beech</b> was 0.62  g/cm 3. All specimens were collected with end matching in the grain direction, and all were air-dried specimens having around 10  % moisture content.|$|R
40|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>beech</b> {{is a key}} {{topic for}} Europe as {{it is one of}} the most {{important}} and abundant broad-leaf species. Physical, mechanical and esthetical features influence both the value and the usage of this wood in each commercial product. In this sense, the comprehension of the surface color modifications induced by solar irradiation is of crucial importance to define the commercial value <b>of</b> the <b>beech</b> wood. Starting from these general remarks, the aim of this work is to study the surface modifications on beech wood with and without <b>red</b> <b>heartwood</b> by different spectroscopic techniques and to obtain a modeling of the changes validated by rigorous statistical and chemometric methods together with principal component analysis. The artificial photo-irradiation of the wood samples was performed in a Solar Box. Reflectance spectrophotometry, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging were used to assess artificial sunlight influence. The experimental data were statistically treated in order to evaluate their significance. Color monitoring allowed to find that the chromatic coordinates (L*a*b*) in normal wood and in <b>red</b> <b>heartwood</b> tended to similar values after 504 h of photo-irradiation. Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy showed the rate of photo-degradation of wood surface due to lignin oxidation and the statistical analysis allowed to demonstrate that red heart and normal wood have the same behavior. Concerning hyperspectral imaging (HSI), the detected spectral features were correlated to color changes in the Visible-Near Infrared (VIS-NIR) range (400 - 1000 nm) and to the variations of cellulose and lignin during accelerated aging in the Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) range (1000 - 2500 nm). The most important result is that a correlation, validated by statistical analysis, of the color changes may be derived with the photo-degradation of wood components obtained by spectral analysis. This fact suggests the possibility to choose the reflectance spectrophotometry as a non-invasive, simple standard method to monitor the state of preservation of the wood surfaces...|$|R
