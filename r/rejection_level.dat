40|$|Abstract—A {{feedback}} LNA employs programmable notch filtering so as {{to suppress}} by 20 dB blockers at LO harmonics from 300 MHz to 10 GHz. Fabricated in 65 -nm technology, the LNA exhibits a noise figure of less than 3 dB from 300 MHz to 4 GHz while consuming 8. 6 mW from a 1. 2 -V supply. A critical issue in broadband receivers relates to the mix-ing of the local oscillator (LO) harmonics with large blockers, and has been addressed by harmonic-rejection mixers (HRMs) in recent work [1, 2]. However, <b>rejection</b> <b>levels</b> of 60 dB or higher have been obtained for input frequencies only up to 800 MHz.

The first uses a traditional event study framework and buy-and-hold abnormal returns calculated using carefully constructed reference portfolios.

This approach can be useful to select a <b>rejection</b> <b>level</b> that balances the number of false positives and negatives and to assess the degree of overlap between the two sets of P-values.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effect of the number of {{averaged}} responses on the measurement of transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs). Methods: The study was performed on the background of a universal newborn hearing screening program implemented in laso Maternity Hospital. Two groups of full-term newborns with normal otoacoustic emissions were studied. The first group included 58 newborns (115) ears, in which 260 low-noise samples, provided by the default setting of the equipment used (ILO 88), were presented. The second group included 58 newborns (113) ears, in which 20 - 50 averaged responses were presented, until the "pass" criteria would be met. Statistical comparison between the following parameters recorded during TEOAE measurement was performed: Overall response, signal-to-noise ratios, reproducibility (whole and partial), stimulus intensity, stimulus stability, input noise, noise <b>rejection</b> <b>level</b> and duration of testing. Results: Statistically significant differences were found in most of these parameters, except for overall response, stimulus intensity and noise <b>rejection</b> <b>Level.</b> Conclusions: Although a smaller number of clicks is usually sufficient to obtain a "pass" in newborn hearing screening programs, the quality of recording of TEOAEs is significantly improved by increasing the number of averaged tow-noise responses.

If, with one statistical test, your chance of a significant result is 5 %, then, after 20 tests, it will increase to 40 %. This result {{is based on the}} play of chance. In current clinical trials, instead of a single efficacy-variable of one treatment, multiple efficacy-variables of more than one treatment are increasingly assessed. METHODS: The current paper reviews some methods for reducing the problem of falsely positive results due to multiple testing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: These methods include (1) the Bonferroni test, (2) the least significant difference (LSD) test, (3) other less conservative, more rarely used methods like Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test, Dunnett's test, Student-Neuman-Keuls test, Hochberg's adjustment, and the Hotelling Q-square test. Alternative approaches to the problem of multiple testing include (4) the construct of composite endpoints, (5) no adjustment at all, but a more philosophical approach to the interpretation of the p-values, and (6) the replacement of the traditional 5 % <b>rejection</b> <b>level</b> with a 1 % <b>rejection</b> <b>level</b> or less.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the incidence of}} consumers’ rejection of private labels (PLs) of different price-quality tiers and the underlying reasons for this rejection. The rejection of PLs is compared to the rejection of national brands (NBs) in five food product categories across the UK and Australia.

This rejection incidence is higher for PLs than for NBs {{in three of the}} five categories. The reasons for brand rejection differ between PLs and NBs. PLs are rejected due to a perception of low quality inferred from extrinsic product cues. In contrast, NBs are rejected primarily because of a negative past experience with a brand.
