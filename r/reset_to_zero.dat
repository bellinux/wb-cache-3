5|$|Each {{season of}} the series is played as a nine-episode tournament with six episodes of opening rounds, two semi-finals, and a final. Each opening round starts with three teams of three contestants {{answering}} questions about the Bible. The teams then nominate their strongest contestants to answer questions by themselves without any assistance from their teammates. After {{this part of the}} round, the third-placed team is eliminated and the two highest-scoring teams compete in a final round with the scores being <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b> The remaining teams answer as many questions correctly as possible within one minute, and the highest-scoring team from this round wins a $20,000 prize which is given to the team's nominated charity. The winning team then advances to a semi-final game against two other winning teams; the winning team from this game advances to a final game where the grand prize is raised to $100,000. Thus, the team that wins the season-long tournament earns a total of $140,000 for their charity.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} {{continuous}} {{use for a}} prescriptive easement to become binding is generally between 5 and 30 years depending upon local laws (sometimes based on {{the statute of limitations}} on trespass). Generally, if the true property owner acts appropriately to defend their property rights {{at any time during the}} required time period the hostile use will end, claims on adverse possession rights are voided, and the continuous use time period will be <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b>|$|E

50|$|For each enemy dispatched, {{the game}} awards a point. The swashbuckler can {{withstand}} two hits, {{but the third}} kills him and ends the game. The difficulty steadily increases until he's overwhelmed. After 83 kills, the pattern of enemies keeps repeating and if the player manages to get 256 kills, the counter <b>resets</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b>|$|R
25|$|Virtually all {{residents}} {{live within the}} boundaries of a municipal corporation. Residents receive most local services at the municipal level, and county government tends to provide few or no services. Differences among states do exist in the level of services provided at the municipal and county level, but generally most functions normally handled by county-level government {{in the rest of the}} United States are handled by town-level government in New England. In Connecticut, Rhode Island, and most of Massachusetts, county government has been completely abolished, and counties serve merely as dividing lines for the judicial system. In other areas, some counties provide judicial and other limited administrative services. In many cases, the house numbers on rural roads in New England <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> upon crossing a town line.|$|E
500|$|I-270 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with I-25 in Welby, and is concurrent with US36. The speed limit {{through the first}} section is [...] The freeway heads southeastward for about one mile (1.6km), crossing over Washington Street and State Highway 224 (SH 224), but access is not provided to either road. Mileposts along I-270 <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> at the I-76 interchange {{because it was the}} original western end of the Interstate. Since the I-76 interchange is close to both I-270's western end and to the I-25/ I-76 interchanges, some movements in the interchange are missing. Eastbound I-270 traffic cannot access westbound I-76, nor can eastbound I-76 traffic access westbound I-270. However, traffic on I-25 can access both westbound I-76 and eastbound I-270, thus completing the missing movements. The three interchanges work together by eliminating bottlenecks caused by redundant interchanges.|$|E
500|$|When {{the player}} {{collects}} at least 50 rings and passes a checkpoint, they can warp to a [...] "special stage". In these stages, the player runs through a pseudo-3D half-pipe course, collecting rings and dodging bombs. A set amount of rings must be collected {{to pass through}} each of three checkpoints and in turn to obtain the emerald itself. If Sonic collides with a bomb, he loses ten rings and is immobilized momentarily. The stages rise in difficulty, and the player cannot enter any stage without passing the previous one. After finishing, the player is transported back to the star post they used to enter the special stage, with their ring-count <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b> When all Emeralds have been collected, if the player chose Sonic, {{he has the ability}} to turn into Super Sonic, which requires 50 rings or more. Super Sonic is yellow and invincible to enemy attacks, and his speed, acceleration, and jump height are increased as well. However, he loses one ring per second and reverts to being regular Sonic when all of his rings are gone.|$|E
50|$|This form of {{oscillator}} sync is less common. This form is {{very similar}} to Hard Sync, with one small difference. In Reversing Soft Sync, rather than <b>resetting</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero,</b> the wave is inverted; that is, its direction is reversed. Reversing Soft Sync is more associated with analog triangle core oscillators than analog sawtooth core oscillators.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Odometer rollover, a {{mechanical}} form of integer overflow. All digits {{are set to}} the maximum 9 and the next increment of the white digit causes a cascade of carry-over additions setting all digits to 0, {{but there is no}} higher digit to change to a 1, so the counter <b>resets</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b> This is wrapping in contrast to saturating.|$|R

2500|$|The {{government}} briefly considered offshore banking. Under {{pressure from}} the US Treasury, Niue agreed to end its support for schemes designed to minimise tax in countries like New Zealand. Niue provides automated Companies Registration, administered by the New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development. The Niue Legislative Assembly passed the Niue Consumption Tax Act {{in the first week}} of February 2009, and the 12.5% tax on goods and services was expected to take effect on 1 April 2009. Income tax has been lowered, and import tax may be <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> except for [...] "sin" [...] items like tobacco, alcohol and soft drinks. Tax on secondary income has been lowered from 35% to 10%, with the stated goal of fostering increased labour productivity.|$|E
2500|$|If {{a player}} cannot play without causing the count to exceed 31, he calls [...] "Go." [...] Continuing with the player on his left, the other player(s) continue(s) the play until {{no one can}} play without the count {{exceeding}} 31. A player is obliged to play a card unless there is no card in their hand that can be played without the count exceeding 31 (one cannot voluntarily pass). Once 31 is reached or no one is able to play, the player who played the last card scores one point if the count is still under 31 and two if it is exactly 31. The count is then <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> and those players with cards remaining repeat the process starting with the player {{to the left of}} the player who played the last card. When no player has any cards the game proceeds to the [...] "show." ...|$|E

5000|$|On {{reaching}} level 10, {{the game}} then displays [...] "Sorry. No more rhymes." [...] No further messages appear until the player rolls-over the level counter by completing level 99. At level 100, the level counter <b>resets</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero,</b> {{and the message}} displayed is [...] "You're a hero on level zero." [...] Thus this same [...] "level zero" [...] message will be repeated every hundredth level.|$|R

2500|$|Glow-transfer {{counting}} tubes, {{similar in}} essential function to the trochotrons, had a glow discharge {{on one of}} a number of main cathodes, visible through the top of the glass envelope. Most used a neon-based gas mixture and counted in base-10, but faster types were based on argon, hydrogen, or other gases, and for timekeeping and similar applications a few base-12 types were available. Sets of [...] "guide" [...] cathodes (usually two sets, but some types had one or three) between the indicating cathodes moved the glow in steps to the next main cathode. Types with two or three sets of guide cathodes could count in either direction. A well-known trade name for glow-transfer counter tubes in the United Kingdom was Dekatron. Types with connections to each individual indicating cathode, which enabled presetting the tube's state to any value (in contrast to simpler types which could only be directly <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> or a small subset of their total number of states), were trade named Selectron tubes.|$|E

50|$|The {{third stage}} is where players attempt to hit their drives on the fairway. They {{can choose to}} hit up to 3 drives. Getting the drives on the fairway results in getting 1, 2 and 3 points {{respectively}} for the three drives in order. Though missing a drive results in points earned for this challenge <b>resetting</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b> If a player hits all 3 drives in the fairway, they can hit a bonus drive worth 5 points.|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{approach}} to fractional Brownian motion (FBM) establishes {{a link between}} non-Poisson renewal process with abrupt jumps <b>resetting</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> the system's memory and correlated dynamic processes, whose individual trajectories keep a non-vanishing memory of their past time evolution. It {{is well known that}} the recrossing times of the origin by an ordinary 1 D diffusion trajectory generates a distribution of time distances between two consecutive origin recrossing times with an inverse power law with index m= 1. 5. However, with theoretical and numerical arguments, it is proved that this is the special case of a more general condition, insofar as the recrossing times produced by the dynamic FBM generates process with m= 2 -H. Later, the model of ballistic deposition is studied, which is as a simple way to establish cooperation among the columns of a growing surface, to show that cooperation generates memory properties and, at same time, non-Poisson renewal events. Finally, the connection between trajectory and density memory is discussed, showing that the trajectory memory does not necessarily yields density memory, and density memory might be compatible with the existence of abrupt jumps <b>resetting</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> the system's memory...|$|R
