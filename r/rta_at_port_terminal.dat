40|$|The {{efficient}} management of logistic operations <b>at</b> <b>port</b> <b>terminals</b> is vital in developing global competition and trade and distributing cargo across geographical borders. The application of standardized approaches improves {{the efficiency of}} logistic operations. This paper presents a conceptual framework based on the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard for analyzing the efficiency of logistic operations <b>at</b> <b>port</b> <b>terminals.</b> The paper contributes to logistics research by studying time efficiency {{in the management of}} trailers and cargo at terminals based on the adoption of the international EPCIS standard. The literature was reviewed to establish a conceptual framework and a case study was then conducted regarding time efficiency in managing the export and import of trailers and transshipments of cargo between trailers <b>at</b> two <b>port</b> <b>terminals</b> in the United Kingdom and one <b>port</b> <b>terminal</b> in the Netherlands. The findings show that by adopting the EPCIS standard, port operators can improve logistic management efficiency, including the arriving, transporting, receiving, inspecting, outbound staging, loading, picking-up, unloading, re-packing, and shipping operations of trailers. This paper identifies how, when managing trailers <b>at</b> <b>port</b> <b>terminals,</b> applying a conceptual framework based on an international standard can improve logistical efficiency so that this management is consistent with the development of a global standard used to enhance planning, traceability, and safety in the port sector...|$|R
