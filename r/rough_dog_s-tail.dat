Tins of bully beef lay about, also, among a wreck of broken glass, some bottles of Bass's beer which had escaped their notice. I found an assegai, cleaned it in the ground which it needed, and opening one of the tins, lay down in a tuft of grass by a dead man, or rather between him and some Zulus whom he had killed, and devoured its contents.

40|$|The protease(s) {{responsible}} for removing the amino-terminal extension of nascent presecretory proteins (signal peptidase) has been extracted from <b>rough</b> microsomes of <b>dog</b> pancreas with the detergent sodium deoxycholate. Preprolactin and pre-growth-hormone, prepared by {{in vitro translation}} of bovine pituitary RNA in the wheat germ system, were used to assay signal peptidase in the extract. When added to the wheat germ system during translation, the extract reduced the size of preprolactin and pre-growth-hormone to that of prolactin and growth hormone, respectively. Post-translational addition of the extract also reduced the size of preprolactin and pre-growth-hormone {{to that of the}} authentic hormones. The prolactin produced by post-translational cleavage of radiolabeled preprolactin has been shown, by partial amino-terminal sequence analysis, to have the correct amino terminus. This post-translational assay has permitted the investigation of the subcellular localization of the enzyme. Sodium deoxycholate extracts of rough microsomes were active, whereas extracts of smooth microsomes were inactive. However, without detergent treatment, neither rough nor smooth microsomes were capable of cleaving preprolactin in the post-translational assay. From this we conclude that the signal peptidase activity is confined to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and is latent. Finally, we have detected two small peptides which we believe could be the signal peptides generated by the endoproteolytic cleavage of preprolactin and pre-growth-hormone by signal peptidase...|$|R

5000|$|Quoted from Collie Club of America:Unfortunately, the Collie's exact origins are {{shrouded}} in obscurity. It {{has been the}} subject of much research and speculation. The word [...] "Collie" [...] is as obscure as the breed itself. The name has been spelled many different ways: Coll, Colley, Coally and Coaly. Generally, the most accepted origin of the word is [...] "Coll" [...] - the Anglo-Saxon word for [...] "black".In the 18th century, the Rough Collie's natural home was in the highlands of Scotland, where he had been used for centuries as a sheepdog. The dogs were bred with great care in order to assist their masters in the herding and guarding of their flock. Without a doubt, it is to the English fancy of the late 1800s that the breed owes its development as a popular show <b>dog.</b> <b>Rough</b> Collies were first exhibited in 1860 at the Birmingham, England dog show, in the generic class [...] "Scotch Sheep-Dogs".In 1879 the first English Rough Collie was imported to this country. It is from England that we find the famous pillars of the breed, from which the American fanciers sought not only their next big winner, but also their foundation stock.By the turn of the century, the American Rough Collie was in a state of continued development. The breed continued to flourish in England. American show prizes were dominated by the British imports. As a result of the imports, the breed made rapid progress between 1900 to 1920. These dogs built the foundations upon which the present day Rough Collie is based and paved the way for the emergence of the great American kennels of the 1920s and 1930s ...|$|R

Dog is shown in the Garden of Eden, exploring its environment and encountering various animals. Its doggy nature is revealed in various scenes from territory marking to barking at a passing mastodon to attempting to befriend a lemur. One day in the savanna, it encounters the newly created Adam who is also exploring Eden. Adam feeds Dog some grains, pets it and moves on. The next day, Adam is high up on a tree, interacting with a bird, when Dog sees him again. Adam tosses down a fruit to Dog and climbs down. He is surprised that Dog is fascinated by the branch (now stripped of fruit) he is holding. When he throws the branch away, Dog fetches it back. Dog is excited when Adam (who knows all animal languages) barks like it. They become friends and explore Eden together. One day, Dog sees Adam with a new creature, Eve with long red hair. Dog attempts to interest Adam in a game of fetch but Adam throws the stick extremely far away in order to get rid of Dog. When Dog returns with the stick, Adam and Eve are gone. Dog waits all day for him to return. At night, Dog (with stick) wanders Eden and sees a panther with a dead rabbit in its mouth. It starts to rain. Dog then sees Adam and Eve, wearing clothes, running through the forest. He chases after them, barking joyously but when Adam turns around, his face is so distorted and sinister, Dog runs away terrified. Other animals also flee them. Adam and Eve stop and stand facing away from each other. They look ashamed, dejected and alone. The next day, Adam and Eve emerge from Eden and enters a bleak desert.
