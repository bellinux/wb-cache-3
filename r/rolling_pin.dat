25|$|Grissom and {{his team}} found the washed-up rock star dead in his kitchen in the episode Built to Kill, Part 2. His body was sprawled {{in a chair and}} leaning {{forwards}} onto the table. They determined that {{the cause of death was}} a single blow delivered to the back of a head with a <b>rolling</b> <b>pin.</b> The first miniature was found close by. It was a perfect diorama of the kitchen, and even included objects in the garbage and placement of Delancy's blood. In the model they also found a picture of a bloodied doll, hidden behind a mini photo frame, and a bleach container in the miniature garbage.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy is}} under the player's control {{throughout}} the game, and is adjustable in multiple ways. For example, the player can control the distribution of goods by selecting {{how much of a}} given resource is transported to a given building, under six separate headings; foodstuff, grain, iron, coal, boards and water. In a similar manner, the player can select what tools are made when; by increasing the significance of a particular tool, that tool will be produced before others. Tool production is important insofar as all buildings require raw materials and a worker with the right tool. For example, if the player has built a bakery, and the building is still empty despite idle settlers in the headquarters, a <b>rolling</b> <b>pin</b> will need to be manufactured in the toolsmith.|$|E

They often quarrelled, but the {{situation}} escalated in 1944 when her mother left the family during the evacuation. Max demanded that Lothar choose between parents, threatening her with a gun and leaving her in a room with an hour to choose; when he came in to kill her, she struck him with a <b>rolling</b> <b>pin</b> and killed him. In January 1945, after several weeks in a psychiatric institution, Lothar was sentenced by a court in Berlin to four years detention as an anti-social juvenile delinquent.

Magnani not only went for Quinn with the pasta and with a <b>rolling</b> <b>pin,</b> but with her foot; she kicked so hard she broke a bone in her right foot. She also bit him in the neck. 'That's not in the script', Quinn protested. Magnani snarled, 'I'm supposed to win this fight, remember?" ...|$|E
