5000|$|The 2017 {{model year}} Chevrolet Suburban {{received}} upgraded changes after {{it went on}} sale in August 2016. The level trims LS and LT are retained but the LTZ is renamed Premier, the latter serving as the equivalent to the Yukon XL Denali. The LS trims also saw the badged [...] "LS" [...] lettering removed. The new features includes two new colors (Blue Velvet Metallic and Pepperdust Metallic), two new 22-inch wheel options (a 7-spoke Silver wheels with Chrome inserts for all trims; Ultra Bright machined aluminum wheels with Bright Silver finish for Premier trim only), black <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> cross <b>rails</b> (as part of the Texas Edition Package and All-Season Package), front active aero shutters (all trims), and heated and vented seats (Premier trim only). The MyLink was updated to incorporate Teen Driver, App Shop, Rear Seat Reminder customization, and Low Speed Forward Automatic Braking (as part of Enhanced Driver Alert Package on the LS trim, but standard on LT and Premier). The Rear Seat Entertainment System was overhauled to include a new video voiceover feature for the visually and hearing impaired, a HDMI/MHL connector, digital headphones, Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) technology incorporated into the Wi-Fi system, and a 2nd USB port with capability of charging up to a 2.1-amp {{at the back of}} the console. A Midnight Edition Suburban, an all-black optional package available in 4WD LT and Z71 versions, was introduced for the 2017 model year.|$|R

50|$|A <b>Rack</b> <b>rail,</b> or <b>rack</b> strip, is used {{to mount}} rackable {{electronic}} hardware and 19-inch rack mount accessories within a 19-inch rack.

5000|$|The {{combination}} of H and G is possible. HG would therefore be a narrow gauge locomotive, {{with a mix}} of adhesion and <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> drive. However, the editions of the official list of rolling stock published up to 1939 generally defined HG as [...] "Locomotive for adhesion and <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> drive", and classified the standard gauge RHB steam locomotives as HG 1/2. Since 1966, in respect of railcars and tractors, he or hm has meant pure <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> drive, and eh or mh has meant a mix of adhesion and <b>rack</b> <b>rail</b> drive.|$|R
50|$|Truck bed rack is a {{derivation}} of a <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> {{designed to}} be installed over the bed of a pickup truck. The construction of a bed rack {{is very similar to}} a <b>roof</b> <b>rack,</b> but features tall tubes (legs) that allow to lift the rack platform higher above the bed surface and leave space for cargo inside of the bed. Truck bed racks are often used in a combination with <b>roof</b> <b>racks</b> and form a long cargo platform that allows transportation of oversized items. They are commonly used in constructions and recreation as a base for various gear and tents just like the <b>roof</b> <b>racks.</b>|$|R

25|$|A <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> is {{a common}} trait on many SUV and station wagon vehicles. While <b>roof</b> <b>racks</b> are very useful in {{carrying}} extra storage on a vehicle, they also increase the frontal area of the vehicle and increase the drag coefficient. This is because as the air flows {{over the top of}} the vehicle, following the smooth lines of the hood and windshield, then collides with the <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> and causes turbulence. The removal of this part has led to increases in fuel efficiency in several studies.|$|R

40|$|Suzuki APV has a {{relatively}} high body compare with others vehicle which are typical, especially if it is using a <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> to carry a cargo. With the increase of the central gravity, it will reduce the vehicle stability. Because of that reason, writer {{want to know what}} is the influences of carrying a cargo on <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> to the stability and safety of the vehicle when cornering at high speed on a climbing road or a down road. The stability of a vehicle could be discovered when it’s cornering, because at that time the resultant of Central Gravity Vehicle will transpose into a new position in order to the influences of a centrifugal force that work at the body. Analyze done by varying speed, steering angle and <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> cargo position, and it will gain the centrifugal force that work on vehicle which will affecting the slip angle as a result to the stability of the vehicle by using a skid analysis and rolling analysis.
