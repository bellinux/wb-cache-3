500|$|In 2008, an old video {{surfaced}} of Mills {{wearing a}} mink coat she had owned in 1989, but explained to reporters {{that she had}} bought it years before becoming involved in animal rights organisations or vegetarianism. Although she had separated from McCartney, Mills said: [...] "It's only since I met Paul [...] that I <b>really</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> understand how vegetarianism not only benefits your health massively but also makes a huge difference to the planet, to animals, and to feeding the world."

We didn't want to go there and just shoot Frenchy's Chicken and call it an [...] "authentic video." [...] There was tons of hanging out, getting the feel, all with cameras ready. We hooked up with our dude Scotty who was a great help, plus Bun B's brother Truck, and Paul Wall.

500|$|Zap2it's Sam McPherson {{gave the}} series an A {{and thought it}} was the show's strongest series since its revival in 2005. He praised Smith and Gillan, though he noted that Amy did not have much {{character}} development, and considered Darvill [...] "might just {{be one of the best}} actors on television currently". However, he noted that most of the episodes took place on Earth or spaceships, and wished to see the Doctor, Amy and Rory [...] "branch out more in the future". Dave Golder of SFX gave the series four out of five stars, noting that it looked [...] "very promising" [...] though [...] "there was a tentative, slightly awkward feel to the series", similar to the first series. He also labelled Smith as [...] "magnificent" [...] and Gillan as [...] "lovely, although so far Amy's character has been so dictated by the requirements of the arc plot that it's difficult to feel that we've <b>really</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know her yet".|$|E
500|$|On November 30, 1961 he {{was traded}} to the San Francisco Giants along with Don Larsen in {{exchange}} for four players (three of them pitchers) who had spent most or all of 1961 in the minor leagues. Giants manager Alvin Dark declared his intent to use Pierce as the ace of a young pitching staff that included developing talents such as Juan Marichal, Gaylord Perry and Mike McCormick. Unlike the White Sox, the Giants featured a powerful offense which included Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and Orlando Cepeda, and Pierce took advantage of the improved run support with his new team, winning his first eight starts before suffering a 4–3 loss on June 7. His first start on April 13 was a deeply rewarding one, after a rough spring training in which he recorded a 16.45 ERA. Facing the Cincinnati Reds, he retired the first 13 batters and allowed only two hits in 7⅓ innings. The crowd of 23,755 gave him a roaring ovation, and he later said, [...] "The cheers <b>really</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> me inside. Fans nowhere could have been more wonderful.

500|$|The Daily Mirror Beth Neil branded {{the plot}} strand [...] "one of the darkest and most {{disturbing}} storylines EastEnders has ever attempted", with critic Jim Shelley deeming it a [...] "new low" [...] for EastEnders. Shelley wrote of Whitney's abuse: [...] "You've <b>really</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{hand it to}} EastEnders. Just when you thought the show couldn't get any more miserable, the writers come up trumps and produce {{a new way of}} making us depressed - a paedophile storyline. Thanks for that! I realise now this is what the family meal has been missing three nights a week: gathering the telly to watch a grubby, greasyhaired thug drooling over a 15-year-old girl who (as luck would have it) spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she's not at school. And they say family entertainment's dead." [...] Shelley refuted the BBC's claims that the storyline had educational value as [...] "totally bogus", observing that [...] "At 7.30 or 8pm, the [...] "action" [...] has to be so coded as to be pointless".

In October 2016, Derrickson confirmed he had plans for a sequel, saying, [...] "I love the character, I love the visual possibilities, and I know the comics so well— the tip of an iceberg. There's so much progress that can be made." [...] He would like to follow the example of The Dark Knight and [...] "bring in a villain where you <b>really</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go deep [...] a more visceral experience". Cumberbatch added that he had signed on for at least one more Doctor Strange solo film. Derrickson hoped to feature Nightmare in a potential sequel, and expressed interest in further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir in a sequel, after their smaller roles in the first film. He also explained that he is [...] "kept in the loop" [...] on how the Avengers films will use Strange, because of his close relationships with Feige and co-director Joe Russo. Spaihts has also expressed interest in seeing Clea appear in a potential sequel. By April 2017, it was reported that Derrickson would return for a potential sequel, beginning work on it after fulfilling his commitments to the television series, Locke & Key.|$|E
500|$|Jacobs {{departed}} from Holby City in 2011, wanting to [...] "broaden [...] horizons" [...] {{after seven years}} in the programme. The thirteenth series saw the departure of many regular cast members, {{and the arrival of}} a group of new ones, including Guy Henry, Laila Rouass, and Jimmy Akingbola. Jacobs deemed it [...] "a new era with a new cast", one which she was not part of, and stated that the time felt right to leave. She had some input in her exit storyline, the focal point of which was Donna's relationship with Kieran, as they moved away to begin a new life together. Jacobs relayed feedback she had received from the general public with regards to how Donna should leave, and this was incorporated into her departure. The actress felt personal pressure to get Donna's last scenes right, wanting to give the best performance possible. She found the filming [...] "overwhelming", explaining [...] "it was incredibly emotional and intense, and it made it all very hard, and raw. [...] It wasn't until later that I realised I'd put myself under a hideously stressful situation, and that I should just be enjoying the experience." [...] She stated: [...] "I've absolutely loved playing Donna. I know that I'm going to look back very fondly on the time I had with her.

On the following day, the band's producer, Ted Templeman told Van Halen that Angel was recording their own cover of [...] "You <b>Really</b> <b>Got</b> Me" [...] <b>to</b> release before Van Halen's version.

500|$|In {{addition}} to gameplay, {{she was also}} one of the first characters to have her backstory fleshed out. In an interview with PC Gamer, the game's creative director, Chris Metzen stated, [...] "Tracer [...] one of the first characters we <b>really</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know. And while she wasn't particularly created to be a starring role, if you will, we felt on the team, the more we got to know her and play her, she was kind of like this Spider-Man type character for us. She's so rad, and it feels good to leverage her in the front of story ideas." [...] Tracer has also been noted for being a peppy character, with Hardcore Gamers Kevin Dunsmore describing her as a [...] "spunky Brit [...] full of little quips as she zips around the battlefield". Kaplan described [...] "Tracer [...] cute and playful, and she's the type of person who does everything with a wink and a smile." [...] In an interview with PCGamesN, game designer Michael Chu stated that [...] "the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people. She is incredibly optimistic, she is incredibly bubbly - it's part of her hero persona.

[...] To reflect her English origin, Tracer is voiced by English actress Cara Theobold.|$|E
500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{integrated}} the band's typical punk and funk style, but {{moved away}} from this with more melodically driven songs. Tracks like [...] "The Righteous and the Wicked", [...] "Suck My Kiss", [...] "Blood Sugar Sex Magik", [...] "Give it Away" [...] and [...] "Funky Monks" [...] still incorporated use of heavy metal guitar riffs, but differed from Mother's Milk in that they contained less distortion. Flea, who had centered his bass playing around the slapping technique, downplayed on this {{in favor of more}} traditional and melodic bass lines. He also adopted a minimalist, [...] "less is more" [...] philosophy: [...] "I was trying to play simply on Blood Sugar Sex Magik because I had been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've <b>really</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> chill out and play half as many notes'. When you play less, it's more exciting—there's more room for everything. If I do play something busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good." [...] Kiedis felt that the album would expand the Chili Peppers' musical horizons, and that it was a departure from their previous material. One of Blood Sugar Sex Magiks more melodic tracks, [...] "Breaking the Girl", was written about Kiedis' constantly shifting relationships. He feared that he was following in his father's footsteps and simply becoming a womanizer, rather than establishing stable and long-term relationships: [...] "...As exciting and temporarily fulfilling as this constant influx of interesting and beautiful girls can be, {{at the end of the}} day, that shit is lonely and you're left with nothing." [...] The track also featured a bridge in the middle, consisting of percussion instruments salvaged from a garbage dump.|$|E

Treacher said [...] "The breakdown story <b>really</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> me. One night I came home, had a drink and just started weeping.

We might lose momentum if we don't keep creating. So I [...] 'What have you got, man?' And he said, 'Mate, I've got nothing'. He'd been saying {{for a couple of}} years that he wasn't sure this is what he was meant to do. He didn't feel like a rapper any more. He didn't feel like a lyricist any more. He wanted to go back to his artwork, which is his first love. I said, 'I understand. You should leave the band'". Del completed the tour, then quit to become an in-house artist at Walt Disney Animation Studios in Australia. Aya told Dino Scatena of The Daily Telegraph that [...] "What was best for him was best for us because his malaise might permeate the band and I would much rather he leave and we be strong and revitalised rather than try to perpetuate an old chemistry that wasn't working".|$|E
2500|$|However, one film {{in which}} Orbison {{refused to allow}} his music to be used was Blue Velvet. Director David Lynch asked to use [...] "In Dreams", and Orbison {{initially}} declined Lynch's request. Lynch used it anyway. The song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named Frank Booth (played by [...] Dennis Hopper). It was lip-synched by an effeminate drug dealer played by Dean Stockwell, after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere. Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, [...] "I was mortified because {{they were talking about}} the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal... I thought, 'What in the world...?' But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and I <b>really</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie—how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'." ...|$|E

She also commented that it would have a darker tone and that she would be putting her [...] "heart into [...] lyrics". She cited Tracy Chapman, Kate Bush and Tears for Fears as the album's primary influences. Lewis spoke on the sound of the album saying [...] "Well, when I was on tour, we mixed a lot of dancer beats on it – my cousin actually reproduced a lot of the ballads.
