40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this article}} is to apply the concept of Circular Economy, where {{end-of-life}} products and production wastes are recycled into reusable materials, to carbon fibre reinforced plastics. This not only reduces the amount of material disposed into landfills, but also enables manufacturers to achieve significant savings. While current research focuses on the performance of recycled carbon fibre reinforced composites after one recycling process, this paper aims to investigate the performance of composites remanufactured from short carbon fibres that have undergone multiple recycling loops with the High Performance Discontinuous Fibre (HiPerDiF) method. The HiPerDiF method enables the production of aligned short fibre composites with exceptional mechanical properties. In addition, using short fibres makes the composite material intrinsically easy to recycle. Short virgin carbon fibres underwent two loops of fibre reclamation and remanufacturing. A correlation between the composites’ mechanical properties and the nature of the fibres, i. e. reduction in fibre lengths, as well as the residual matrix accumulation from the <b>reclaiming</b> <b>process</b> over a number of recycling loops, was established...|$|E

Taking into account thermogravimetric (TG) analysis results of the binder, the temperature range - required for performing the efficient reclamation of spent moulding sand containing this binder - was indicated. In order to confirm the assumptions, the thermal reclamation operations were carried out at a temperature similar to the determined on the TG basis and - for comparisons - at lower and higher temperatures. During the reclamation operation the reclaim samples were taken for the loss on ignition testing, aimed at the determination of the process efficiency. Temperature in the reclaimer chamber and gas consumptions were also recorded. On the bases of the thermal analyses, loss on ignition, gas consumption and temperatures of the reclaimed moulding sand bed the recommendations for the realisation of the thermal reclamation were given.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} overview of reclamation of cured rubber with {{special emphasis on}} latex reclamation is depicted in this paper. The latex industry has expanded {{over the years to}} meet the world demands for gloves, condoms, latex thread, etc. Due to the strict specifications for the products and the unstable nature of the latex as high as 15 % of the final latex products are rejected. As waste latex rubber (WLR) represents a source of high-quality rubber hydrocarbon, it is a potential candidate for generating reclaimed rubber of superior quality. The role of the different components in the reclamation recipe is explained and the reaction mechanism and chemistry during reclamation are discussed in detail. Different types of <b>reclaiming</b> <b>processes</b> are described with special reference to processes, which selectively cleave the cross links in the vulcanized rubber.

40|$|AbstractChemical {{solvents}} such as alkanolamines {{that are}} used for CO 2 capture from flue gases are vulnerable to quality deterioration which causes a number of operational challenges due to the accumulation of degradation products {{and other types of}} impurities within the solvent. To maintain solvent absorption efficiency and avoid operating problems, it is important to continuously remove the accumulated contaminants from the solvent by including a <b>reclaiming</b> <b>process</b> within large commercial CO 2 capture plants. The new HTC solvent reclaimer system, called delta Reclaimer, has been integrated within the 800 ton per day CO 2 amine capture plant at the Searles Valley Minerals Facility (SVM) to remove the undesirable contaminants from a solvent slipstream and return the clean solvent back to solvent circulation in the CO 2 plant. The detailed analysis of the feed stream, product stream and waste stream shows that the delta Reclaimer is capable of removing most of the undesirable impurities and restoring the solvent to its original purity at a high recovery rate and minimum energy consumption. At normal operating conditions the recovery rate of the MEA solvent reaches 98 % and the steam consumption is about 1 lb steam (40 psig) per 1 lb of recovered solvent. Very concentrated waste is collected periodically while the reclaimer process is in continuous operation. This technique contributed to a huge reduction of the quantity of waste collected for disposal...|$|E

For better understanding the plasticizing effect of bitumen {{on the quality of}} obtained reclaimed rubber, mechano-chemically reclaimed GTR has been compared with GTR after thermo-mechanical reclaiming via low temperature extrusion (120 °C), which allows generation of high shear forces on GTR. <b>Reclaiming</b> <b>process</b> was evaluated by oscillating disc rheometer measurements, followed by mechanical, physical, thermal, and morphological properties analyses performed on vulcanized reclaimed rubber. The obtained results showed that application of bitumen during mechano-chemical reclaiming of GTR improves processing and prevents oxidation of reclaimed GTR through enhancement of physical and chemical interactions between GTR and bitumen. On the other hand, high shear forces acting on GTR during thermo-mechanical reclaiming caused effective scission of cross-linking bonds, {{while at the same time}} an adverse oxidative degradation of GTR occurs. Noticeably, the type of bitumen strongly affected the nature of the interfacial interactions between GTR and bitumen.

40|$|Water supply {{plays an}} {{important}} role in all mining ventures, particularly with projects in water scarce regions. A comprehensive water supply strategy for mining projects is important to ensure that fair allocation of water is maintained for municipal, agricultural and industrial users in the region. The consumption of fresh water for processing copper concentrates can be substantially reduced through the adoption of hydrometallurgical processes that incorporate salt water; particularly when compared to pyrometallurgical processes that require fresh water. Developed by Teck, the CESL hydrometallurgical process allows for the incorporation of salt water to reduce fresh water requirements in the processing of copper concentrates. Further, it should be noted that water additions to the process are already minimized through <b>reclaiming</b> <b>process</b> water by use of a closed-circuit evaporator. Bench-scale testwork is presented which demonstrates the opportunities related to salt water additions on metal recovery and overall metallurgical performance. An average copper extraction of 97. 3 % was achieved while fresh water consumption was decreased from 1. 63 m 3 /t concentrate to 0. 67 m 3 /t concentrate through salt water substitution.

40|$|Ground tire rubber (GTR) from whole {{passenger}} car tires {{is composed of}} several types of rubbers and fillers, making de-vulcanization of this material rather complicated. The most critical component in this material is SBR, as it tends to degrade and recombine during the commonly used <b>reclaiming</b> <b>processes.</b> In a thermo-chemical de-vulcanization process of sulfur-vulcanized SBR with diphenyldisulfide (DPDS) as de-vulcanization aid, a reduction of crosslink density is observed up to a temperature of 220 C. Beyond this temperature threshold, the 3 crosslink density rises again. This is due to intra-molecular rearrangements of chain fragments of butadiene moieties from uncontrolled degradation and oxidation effects. By the addition of oxidation stabilizers, degradation is suppressed and the oxidation cycles are interrupted. By choosing an appropriate stabilizer for SBR, a further decrease in crosslink density can be achieved at temperatures higher than 220 C. This combination of DPDS as de-vulcanization aid and oxidation stabilizers significantly enhances the de-vulcanization de-vulcanization efficiency of SBR versus DPDS alone. The results are interpreted in terms of mechanisms of main chain and sulfur bridge scission and the degradative cycles triggered {{by the presence of}} oxygen...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the largest}} {{expenses}} in CO 2 capture is the transport and disposal of waste from the amine reclaimer, and top up of fresh amine KIP. The main {{reason for this is}} because the waste stream contains quite large amounts of fresh amine, and the sheer volume of waste. If amount of MEA in waste could be reduced, both the volume of waste would be reduced, which lowers the transport and disposal cost, and the amount of amine for top up would be reduced. In other words, the total operational cost of the system could be considerably lowered. This study investigated the possibility of reducing the amine (MEA) in the waste stream by looking at a two stage <b>reclaiming</b> <b>process.</b> A model based on the work done by Linn Christine Loe Haaversen was developed to include several new features, including a second stage. This model was the basis of cost optimization. The cost optimization took several factors into account. The cost of waste transportation and handling, top up amine cost, cost of compressing low pressure lean amine to the pressure of main system and heat input to reclaimer vessels all were included the objective function subject to minimization. The unconstrained variables in this optimization were heat entered into both stages, and pressure in second stage. From the results of the optimization, a second low pressure stage is beneficiary from an operating cost perspective. A cost minimum was detected where 63. 9...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of reclaimed scenarios on soil enzyme activities and microbial community in a reclaimed surface coal mine on the Northwest Loess Plateau of China. Soil samples were collected from a bare land (CK), and a plantation (PL) and four mixed forests (MF 1 - 4). Soil physicochemical characteristics, four enzyme activities and microbial abundance and T-RFLP (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism) profiles were measured. Effects of reclaimed scenarios on soil nutrients content, enzyme activities and microbial community were pronounced. Soil organic carbon could be well used to predict the major differences in enzyme activities, and microbial abundance and composition. Soil enzyme activities were more significantly correlated with fungal abundance than bacterial and archaeal ones. The higher soil nutrient content, enzyme activities, and microbial abundance and diversity were from mixed forests and the lowest ones were from CK, which suggested mixed forests would be feasible scenarios in semi-arid Loess Plateau.

40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture in {{post-combustion}} {{by the use}} of amines is one {{of several}} technologies known to reduce the release of CO 2 to the atmosphere when burning fossil fuels. One of the problems related to the amine process is amine degradation, which leads to accumulation of degradation products. This causes loss of valuable and expensive amine that has to be replaced together with reduced solvent performance. To prevent these degradation products to accumulate, and to regain lost solvent, a reclaimer can be used to purify the contaminated amine solution. The most effective techniques used to purify amine solutions include distillation (thermal reclaiming), ion exchange and electrodialysis. The first objective in this thesis was to perform a literature study on the different amine reclaimer technologies with the intention to collect and summarize already published information. The technologies were compared and evaluated. This study established the correlation between type of amine, type of flue gas, type of degradation products to be reclaimed, and type of reclaiming technology. The second objective was to develop a model of a thermal <b>reclaiming</b> <b>process</b> for monoethanolamine (MEA). Based on vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data, mass and energy balances, a model to reclaim MEA was made. Improvements of the model are suggested. The third objective was to simulate the reclaimer process model using MATLAB. An ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver was used to solve the set of differential equations. Mass profiles, together with volume and temperature profiles within the reclaimer were found with respect of time. Simulated data was compared to real reclaimer data to test how well the model explains the conditions in a thermal reclaimer. Even though the simulated data did not fit the curves from the real data accurately, the simulations are believed to present the conditions in a reclaimer well. The model still needs some improvements. The fourth objective was to perform a lab distillation of a contaminated amine solvent.

40|$|One glorious autumn afternoon, {{when the}} temptation was {{to enjoy the}} {{sunshine}} whilst digging and clearing drudgeries associated with completing our dissertations, Bisi and I decided to mulch {{away some of the}} frustrations and challenges of our learning journeys. We had been struggling desperately to finish our dissertations, both using critical ethnography as a methodological approach; so we definitely had some common ground to listen and share valued insights with each other. The marvel of those shared moments appeared when we discovered how similar our learning paths {{over the past four years}} had been and how we had often suffered separately even whilst working alongside one another. It had become a lone struggle to explain the research as we moved further away in our memories from our participants, who had initially been our collaborators and point of praxis. Were we in the dip? Were we experiencing the ‘lone ethnography' syndrome? We had both conducted our research in Western Australian public schools, had listened and transcribed many hours of our participants' narratives and had somehow managed to find almost identical themes of discussion to explain our stories. One of these themes was that of relationships and how significant they were in how students and teachers connected, not only how they influenced the identity construction of teachers in their first year of teaching but also how students interpreted policies that teachers were asked to implement in schools. Another commonality was in doing this type of research, where we applied critical social theory and post-structural theory to the "realms of field work and data interpretation" (Carspecken, 1991, p. 1) we were both experiencing some of the aftershocks of disrupting dominant discourses in the neo-liberal domain. The reinforcement and <b>reclaiming</b> <b>process</b> of validating each other's research on making a difference in the lives of first year teachers and high school students respectively provided the impetus for further investigation, analysis and action. This presentation is about our story of positioning ourselves in such a way that we could hear voices from the field that would otherwise be silent. We would like to share some of the common challenges we encountered in using critical ethnography in education research, including collecting data, gaining ethics approval, passing gatekeepers, maintaining trust and connections with participants and representing their multiple voices. Most significantly, we will outline how we were also able to meet some of those challenges, including the point of praxis and empowerment gained from collaborating for this conference, whereby we were able to re-imagine and relive our research projects, our responses to the local research sites and the knowledge and experience gained in the process. What has emerged is a revised sense of our ethnographic selves, no longer autonomous but as connected, not as detached but related in a dialect that is relational and dialogic (Brown, 2004, p. 312). Our emphasis then is not on our individual research stories, even though they are unique, but on the commonalities and relationships between them.

40|$|Neither agency (Arnould, 2007) nor escape (Kozinets, 2002) are {{attainable}} ideals {{for consumers}} striving for emancipation from the market. A {{growing body of}} studies acknowledges that consumers seeking for feelings of agency engage in retailing activities to provoke social change (Bradford and Sherry, 2015; Hietanen et al., 2016). Consumer-driven retailing initiatives, such as community-supported agriculture but not exclusively, has been often studied as means to express resistance against consumer culture or markets; Moraes, Szmigin and Carrigan (2010) argue that communities of consumers proposing alternative forms of retailing are in fact better described as being animated by positive entrepreneurial practices and discourses. The retailer socialization process, defined as the process through which consumers become retailers in a pure entrepreneurial surge, {{does not lead to}} any proposed alternative form of retailing (McGrath, 1989). Free of any desire for change, this concept does not seem suitable to explain the growing number of consumer-driven alternative forms of retailing. The process by which consumers seeking for change decide to become retailers and to propose alternative forms of retailing is the purpose of this study. Building on studies of markets dynamics from the perspective of symbolic appropriation (Arsel and Thompson, 2011; Bradford and Sherry, 2015; Debenedetti, Oppewal and Arsel, 2014; Dion and Arnould, 2011; Firat and Venkatesh, 1995; Kozinets et al., 2004; Murray, 2002; Thompson and Haytko, 1997; Visconti et al., 2010; Wallendorf and Arnould, 1991; Weinberger, 2015), we propose that consumers producing retailing alternative engage in a reclaiming (reappropriation) process (Schiele and Venkatesh, 2016). We define reappropriation as a process by which actors feeling alienation seek to regain control of cultural resources that they consider to have been deprived of, and manipulate these resources to redefine or restore their symbolic meanings. Our study is based on two case studies of consumer-driven alternative retailing forms. The first one is an 18 -months long ethnographic case study (Visconti, 2010) of a collaborative supermarket initiative directly inspired by the Park Slope Food Coop in Brooklyn which is based on a model of participation through work and shared ownership. The second case is a multi-site study (Yin, 1994) of four consumers using a multi-sided Internet platform to build, animate and connect a community of local producers and a community of consumers which are not contractually engaged to buy. Weekly distributions are organized to allow consumers to meet producers and to collect their purchases. Both case studies combine semi-structured interviews (consumers-entrepreneurs, producers, consumers), observation and collection of secondary data (‘corporate’ documents, websites and social networks’ pages; blogs posts, press articles…). Data have been thematically coded and analyzed, and a discussion between the two cases has been organized to seek for similarities and differences between them. Results depict a six-stage, non-linear reappropriation process: 1 / feeling of deprivation and refusal of passivity, 2 / intra and intersubjective dialogic process of reinterpretation of the meanings of intermediation, 3 / appropriation of retailers’ practices and strategies, 4 / development of a feeling of possession, 5 / sharing and development of community belonging feelings, 6 / feelings of emancipation and regained control over consumption. In engaging in this <b>reclaiming</b> <b>process,</b> consumers contribute to shape retailing networks which are alternative {{in the way that they}} embody a renewed symbolic meaning of intermediation providing them with high levels of “linking” value (Cova, 1997).
