50|$|Spring punches, {{also called}} <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punches, {{are used to}} drive <b>roll</b> <b>pins.</b> Standard pin punches should never be used on a <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b> Because of the hollow, thin wall {{construction}} of a <b>roll</b> <b>pin,</b> a standard pin punch will often collapse, mar or distort {{the end of the}} pin or be driven into, and jammed inside, the hollow core of the <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b> When choosing a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch, select one that is no larger than the compressed diameter of the pin. If a punch is used that is larger than the pin,the surrounding metal in which the pin is seated can be damaged. Also, a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> punch should not be used which is smaller than the compressed diameter of the pin.

50|$|A {{spring pin}} (also called tension <b>pin</b> or <b>roll</b> <b>pin)</b> is a {{mechanical}} fastener that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. Spring pins have a body diameter which is larger than the hole diameter, and a chamfer on either one or both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole. The spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole. The force exerted by the pin against the hole wall retains it in the hole, therefore a spring pin is considered a self retaining fastener. Spring pins are designed for use in double shear applications.|$|R
5000|$|The {{slide of}} the pre-1996 P226 {{was a heavy}} gauge, mill {{finished}} sheet metal stamping with a welded on nose section incorporating an internal barrel bushing. The breech block portion was a machined insert attached to the slide by means of brazing and a <b>roll</b> <b>pin</b> visible from either side. Since 1996, production has shifted to CNC machining and the slide is now milled from {{a single piece of}} stainless steel. Therefore, the current standard P226 has a Nitron coated, stainless steel slide. This resulted in a stronger slide, which was necessary to chamber the more powerful [...]40 S&W and [...]357 SIG cartridges. The frame of most models is made from hard anodized aluminum alloy.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a {{further development of}} an existing prototype named Automatic <b>pin</b> bone <b>remover.</b> The further development was requested from the Swedish consulting firm ATM AB. The request of automatic <b>pin</b> bone <b>removers</b> is high and {{has the potential to}} be a worldwide leading product. The goal with the thesis work is to further develop an existing prototype. In order to achieve the goal a pre-study of the prototype had to be made in order to define a customer demand specification. The thesis work is then continued by a function analysis which differs from a conservative one.  For each sub-function various sub solutions a made. The advantage of this method is that it results in various total solutions which after an evaluation one will be chosen for further development. To examine if the fully developed prototype achieved the given demands a test specification was made. The tests resulted in success, however later in the thesis it is recommended to perform tests on a real prototype to ensure that the given demands are fulfilled. These tests however are not a part of this thesis. The economic sub goal with the thesis was not properly fulfilled, however the remaining goals was fulfilled successfully.   The result of the thesis was an improved prototype, manufacturing documentation of the prototype and a suggestion of material change that could lead to reduced total costs. ...|$|R
50|$|More {{recently}} in 2011/12 was {{the addition of}} a Picatinny rail to the frame under the barrel as standard on all models whose number ends in R. The major difference in slide design, between the older model SIG pistols and the current production, is that the older model slides were stamped whereas the current production models are milled on a CNC machine. The stamped models have an end piece at the muzzle end which is welded in place, to complete the slide. Additionally, the older stamped slides feature a removable breech block. This breech block is pinned to the slide with two hollow <b>roll</b> <b>pins,</b> one pressed inside the other, with their split ends opposed. The newer milled slides are a one-piece unit and do not have a removable breech block.|$|R
50|$|In {{the next}} {{scheduled}} match Jerry Lynn faced Sean Waltman. The contest duration was 15 minutes and 31 seconds. During the bout while Lynn {{stood on the}} ring apron, Waltman attempted to suplex {{him back into the}} ring, however, Lynn countered and instead suplexed Waltman over the ring ropes and down to the floor. Waltman scored a near-fall following a groin hit and slamming Lynn's face into the mat with his signature X-Factor maneuver. Chris Sabin, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt came from the backstage area to view this encounter from ringside. Lynn gained the pinfall on Waltman after countering a scoop powerslam into a victory <b>roll</b> <b>pin.</b> Following the bout, Waltman and Lynn shook hands and hugged in a display of mutual respect. This instead was a trick by Waltman, allowing him to attack Lynn and bash Lynn's arm with a steel chair while it was draped over the ring apron until Dutt, Sabin, and Shark Boy came to Lynn's aid.|$|R

50|$|Upon Olin's retirement, Olin Corporation's {{new chief}} {{executives}} sought to maximize company profitability, giving corporate preference to its flourishing chemical business over gun production, which was unprofitable and labor-intensive. As a result, Winchester ceased machining both {{the receiver and}} many small parts of the Model 94 out of solid steel billet as of 1964. Sintered steel was used on the receiver, stamped sheet metal for the cartridge lifter, and hollow rather than solid steel <b>roll</b> <b>pins</b> used in the action. While the rifle's function, safety, and accuracy were not adversely affected, the changes—in particular the sintered receiver, which was as strong as its solid-steel predecessor but which did not respond well to a traditional blued finish—were conspicuous and came as Winchester made even more fundamental changes to its flagship Model 70 bolt-action rifle. Taken together, they were seen as a retreat from quality production across the company's whole range, seriously damaging Winchester's reputation for making quality firearms in the process. In response, many sought out rifles made before 1964, (pre '64), which command a markedly higher resale value on the gun market to this day.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the use of}} modular robotics to encourage and facilitate non-verbal communication during therapeutic intervention in dementia care. A set of new socially interactive modular robotic devices called <b>Rolling</b> <b>Pins</b> (RPs) have been designed and developed to assist the therapist in interacting with dementia affected patients. The RPs are semi-transparent plastic tubes capable of measuring their orientation and the speed of their rotation; at a local level they have three types of feedback: RGB light, sound and vibration. The peculiarity of the RPs {{is that they are}} able {{to communicate with each other}} or with other devices equipped with the same radio communication technology. The RPs are usually used in pairs, as the local feedback of an RP can be set depending not only on its own speed and orientation, but also on the speed and the orientation of the peer RP. The system is not used as a therapeutic tool per se but as facilitator and mediator of social dynamics during normal therapy to counteract social isolation that can result in dementia through the loss of social skills. An experiment is reported showing that using the RPs the patients participated in the activity, coordinating their behaviour with the therapist and imitating the same interaction patterns generated by the therapist...|$|R
