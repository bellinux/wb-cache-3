However, they were not constructed with minarets used for the call to prayer, which was more characteristic in other regions. Gedi's mosques were typically laid out with anterooms flanking the central room, which had a <b>roof</b> <b>supported</b> by wood <b>beams</b> resting on square stone pillars. The isles created by the pillars obstructed the view of the mihrab, which were situated on the north walls in the direction of Mecca.|$|R

50|$|For {{most of the}} {{exterior}} detailing, Fournier selected the Craftsman style, with its broad, sloping roof pierced by shed dormers. He also created wide, unenclosed eaves, exposed rafter tails, and exposed <b>roof</b> <b>beams</b> <b>supported</b> by knee braces. With a Craftsman sense of economy, he eliminated the vestibule. Instead a sheltered partial-width front porch was built. Fournier used the Craftsman device of an elevated dining room window grouping with space under the windows for closets.|$|R

50|$|Irene Mill Finishing Plant, {{also known}} as the Cherokee Finishing Company, is a {{historic}} factory building located at Gaffney, Cherokee County, South Carolina. The building was built in 1915-1916, and is a large, rectangular, one-story brick building with a gable <b>roof</b> with exposed <b>support</b> <b>beams.</b> Also on the property are two small, square brick structures with pyramidal roofs covered with pressed metal shingles. The mill produced damask which was shipped to New England for finishing. In the finishing plant the cloth was washed, soaked, boiled, bleached, and calendered, enabling the mill to produce finished damask products.|$|R

It is a simple construction with a red Spanish tile <b>roof,</b> <b>supported</b> by wood <b>beams.</b> The facade is a simple Neoclassical with six Ionic order columns, three {{on each side of the}} entrance, joined by false arches. The top of the facade has two bell towers. This design is based on the Teopisca church. [...] The church became a cathedral in 1958, shortly after the Tapachula diocese was established but that status has since been ceded to the San José Cathedral, consecrated in 2009.|$|R
50|$|St. Anselm's Catholic Church {{was built}} in 1928-1929 in the Late Gothic Revival style. The {{buildings}} measures 112.5 ft by 47 ft. M.S.

The structure's exterior is covered in brick with stone details, while the foundation consists of concrete blocks. The <b>roof,</b> <b>supported</b> by steel <b>beams,</b> is gabled and covered in asphalt shingles. A belltower on the church's northeast corner is 95 ft high, with limestone spires and traceries carved by stonecutters in Kansas, from which the limestone originated.|$|R

It {{is probably the}} largest locally made wrought iron composition in Queensland.To {{the east of the}} dock is the brick pump house which has an arched <b>roof,</b> <b>supported</b> by timber <b>beams,</b> and a large brick chimney. The two centrifugal pumps for emptying the dock and steam boilers were imported from London. Three new Cornish boilers replaced the originals in 1907 and in 1924 the steam engines were replaced by electric motors constructed by Evans Deakin. During the busy war years the boiler house was enclosed by a concrete blockhouse. The Cornish boilers and their coal chutes, the pump, the electric engine with its sub-station and rope drives are extant but inoperative.|$|R
50|$|The House at 1233 Wentworth Ave. is a {{historic}} house located at 1233 Wentworth Avenue in Pasadena, California. Architect Arthur S. Heineman designed the Cotswold style house, which was built in 1917 for Lydia C. Edmonds. The large front entrance porch is topped by an arched <b>roof</b> <b>supported</b> by wooden <b>beams</b> and wide brick piers. The gable end of this entrance is decorated with half-timbering, while the porch itself has a bargeboard pattern. The house's roof has a wide, low-lying horizontal component over {{the front of the}} first story and a smaller hipped component above the second-story section; both roofs have rolled eaves and wooden shingles, which replaced the original thatch covering in the 1920s. A contributing Cotswold style garage and gazebo are located behind the house.|$|R
500|$|In 1930 the {{northern}} facade {{was given a}} proper entranceway with transomed doors and Doric columns below a frieze identifying the building as the Crane Museum. [...] Above this doorway a circular window was also added. [...] The slate <b>roof</b> and its <b>support</b> <b>beams</b> were also replaced in 1930, but without altering the exterior lines of the building. [...] A late 19th century brick addition to {{the east side of}} the building (not a part of the landmark designation) is screened from view by plantings. [...] The interior of the building is a single large space in which artifacts from the company's history are displayed. [...] Displays include tools used by Zenas Crane and a replica of the early vat process equipment used to make paper.|$|R
5000|$|Inside, {{the nave}} roof, built by Lacy Ridge, is {{considered}} [...] "remarkable". It is in two parts, the easternmost of {{which consists of}} a series of wide trusses. The chancel <b>roof</b> has <b>beams</b> <b>supported</b> on decorated corbels. [...] Most of the windows in the church are lancets. The north wall has four, there are three on the south and east sides, and the west wall has two and a rectangular window with tracery work. Stained glass is set into several of the windows; one commemorates victims of the world wars.|$|R
50|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of the school {{was at the time}} considered to be very advanced. With a concrete superstructure and wood <b>roof</b> and <b>supporting</b> <b>beams,</b> the school resembles a ski lodge. The groups of beams put together on the front side of the school, resembling trees some say, help with stability and support during a tsunami. Also the lights in many of the classrooms are hung from thin cables to allow sway, again {{in the event of an}} earthquake. Technology was a key area of expenditure, with BC Tel (now Telus) and SD45 investing in hundreds of kilometres of fibreoptic cable and extensive audio-visual networking equipment provided by Dynacom. The result was the most technologically advanced school in the province - televisions in each classroom were networked with a tape room and broadcast centre which provided a morning news slide show (as well as VHS and DVD presentations in classrooms), fibreoptic cable reached each classroom, and geothermal heating and cooling regulated the building’s temperature. Today, much of the fiber optic equipment is unused, due in part to the declining application of fiber in a LAN environment in the late 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|The nine-storied Lovamahapaya (3rd century BCE) {{would have}} been an elegant building. It had an exposed wooden frame {{supported}} on stone pillars. It was plastered in white, with shining copper roof tiles and a pinnacle at its apex. It had lightning conductors or chumbakam made of amber and tourmaline. Its rafters were made of talipot palm. It rose to a height of 162 ft and had approximately 179316 sq ft of floor space. It could seat 9000 monks. Roland Silva remarked in 1984 that such an extensive floor space would stagger the designers in Sri Lanka [...] "even today". The dominant element in these buildings, was the tiled <b>roof</b> <b>supported</b> by timber <b>beams</b> and rafters. The roofs were tiled, from as early as the 3rd century BCE, with red, white, yellow, turquoise and brown tiles. There were also tiles made of bronze.|$|R
50|$|The {{shelter of}} the early people changed {{dramatically}} from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic era. In the Paleolithic, people did not normally live in permanent constructions. In the Neolithic, mud brick houses started appearing that were coated with plaster. The growth of agriculture made permanent houses possible. Doorways were made on the roof, with ladders positioned both {{on the inside and}} outside of the houses. The <b>roof</b> was <b>supported</b> by <b>beams</b> from the inside. The rough ground was covered by platforms, mats, and skins on which residents slept. Stilt-houses settlements were common in the Alpine and Pianura Padana (Terramare) region. Remains have been found at the Ljubljana Marshes in Slovenia and at the Mondsee and Attersee lakes in Upper Austria, for example.|$|R
5000|$|The {{structure}} of the megaron foreshadowed an image for the eventual layout of Greek temples. This includes a columned entrance, a pronaos, and a central naos or cella. The design of the megaron originated in Russia from the earliest dated examples, and these originals are Neolithic. An early Megaron has a pitched roof, {{and there were other}} roof types as well such as the flat roof and barrel roof. These are always destroyed in the remnants of the early Megaron, so the definite roof type is not known. See Ancient Roofs for examples. In the theory of architecture, the Megaron is considered to be the earliest architectural act. The floor was of patterned concrete, covered in carpet. On the walls were inlaid paintings called frescoes, these were often of Phoenician style. [...] The Megaron is considered to be the predecessor of all orders in architectural theory. Originally it was very colourful, made with the Minoan architectural order, the insides made of fired brick and a wooden <b>roof</b> <b>supported</b> on <b>beams.</b> The rooftop was tiled with ceramic and terracotta tiles. There were wood ornamented metal doors often two leaved, and footbaths were also used in the megaron. The proportions of a larger width than length is a similar structure to early doric temples.|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} {{concerns}} for the Mitla site are the eroding effects of wind, rain etc. and graffiti. The latter, which is mostly painted or etched, has been a serious problem {{at least since the}} early 20th century. To protect the ruins, especially the grecas, shelters have been constructed over a number of the rooms of the Palace or Columns Group. These shelters are palm thatched <b>roofs</b> <b>supported</b> by wooden <b>beams</b> and columns, and are intended to mimic roofs that were common in the Mesoamerican period. Reconstruction projects planned or underway include, rebuilding the 17th century wall of a room used as a priests’ residence in the Church Group, laying stucco floors in the Columns Group, the sealing of platforms and fortifications walls, landscaping and the restoration of a colonial era rainwater collection tank. The last {{was the only one of}} its kind built in the valley during the colonial period.|$|R
25|$|The {{surviving}} {{elements of}} the original structure include the general arrangement of the interior: three naves separated by three ultra-semicircular arches over Corinthian capitals, and the apse formed of a single rectangular chapel. The many geometrical decorative elements are also original and more numerous than those of any other Iberian monument of the period. The interior {{is divided into three}} sections supported by three arcs, supported by cylindrical columns, with polymorphic capitals. A triumphal arch divides the chapel from the main altar, while the <b>roofs</b> are <b>supported</b> by <b>beam</b> timbers. The high altar is decorated in a carved-wooden retable, gilded in gold, with an image of Saint Peter over the altar. The naves {{on either side of the}} main altar are decorated with carved-wooden chapels covered in gold.|$|R

The three assembly buildings adjoining it were designed by other architects; her building served as the entrance and what she called the [...] "nerve centre" [...] of the complex. As with the Phaeno Science Center, the building is hoisted above street level on leaning concrete pylons. The interior contains a series of levels and floors which seem to cascade, sheltered by tilting concrete <b>beams</b> and a <b>roof</b> <b>supported</b> by steel <b>beams</b> {{in the shape of}} an 'H'. The open interior inside was intended, she wrote, to avoid [...] "the traditional segregation of working groups" [...] and to show the [...] "global transparence of the internal organisation" [...] of the enterprise, and wrote that she had given particular attention to the parking lot in front of the building, with the intent, she wrote, of [...] "transforming it into a dynamic spectacle of its own." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{confident}} {{were the}} Rebu {{that if the}} Egyptians dug through their walls, or even threw them down by undermining them, they could repel their assault, that they took but little heed to the huts established {{at the foot of}} the wall, except that a strong body of men were stationed behind the walls, half of whom were always to be under arms in readiness to repel the Egyptians should they burrow through. This confidence proved their ruin. The Egyptians were thoroughly accustomed to mining operations, and were fully aware that were they to pierce the wall the Rebu could at once overwhelm the small working parties; they, therefore, after penetrating a considerable distance into the embankment, drove right and left, making an excavation of considerable size, the <b>roof</b> being <b>supported</b> by <b>beams</b> and planks hauled up at night.|$|R
5|$|Modern day native {{groups such}} as the Yurok, Tolowa, Karok, Chilula, and Wiyot all have {{historical}} ties to the region, and some Native American groups still live in the park area today. Archaeological study shows they arrived in the area as far back as 3,000 years ago. An 1852 census determined that the Yurok were the most numerous, with 55 villages and an estimated population of 2,500. They used the abundant redwood, which with its linear grain was easily split into planks, as a building material for boats, houses, and small villages. For buildings, the planks would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions bound with leather strapping and held by notches cut into the <b>supporting</b> <b>roof</b> <b>beams.</b> Redwood boards were used to form a shallow sloping roof.|$|R
