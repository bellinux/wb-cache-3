Most jurisdictions in the United States have enacted statutes that prohibit a testator from disinheriting a spouse, or provided that in the event of such a will the spouse may elect to [...] "take against the will" [...] and claim a statutory share of a decedent's estate.

50|$|Seisin is now {{confined}} to {{possession of the}} freehold, though at one time {{it appears to have}} been used for simple possession without regard to the estate of the possessor. Its importance is considerably less than it was at one time, owing to the old form of conveyance by feoffment with livery of seisin having been superseded by a deed of grant, and the old rule of descent from the person last seised having been abolished in favour of descent from the purchaser. Lord Denning controversially supported the abolition of the concept of seisin, however the common law has since decided to maintain the concept of seisin. At one time the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the wife to dower and of the husband to an estate by curtesy depended upon the doctrine of seisin. The Dower Act (1833-1834), however, rendered the fact of the seisin of the husband of no importance, and the Married Women's Property Act 1882 practically abolished the old law <b>of</b> <b>curtesy.</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explicate often {{neglected}} problems of courtesy in relation to intercultural communication between Koreans and Japanese. Anecdotal data show that Koreans misunderstand Japanese courtesy and vice versa. These cultures share much in common historically and culturally. This often deludes intercultural communication partners to perceive that courteous behaviors on one side as authentic, and the other side as anomalous. Therefore, a tentative answer to this perceptual problem is to extract underlying values and principles on each side <b>of</b> <b>curtesy</b> systems. Within Korean culture, Confuciusnists' teaching of seniority (choyo no jo) is still operating strongly. However, courteous behavioral restrictions tend to be abandoned among interpersonal relationships other than a senior-junior relationship. The value of this freedom is not to confuse a senior-junior relationships with other relationships, which enables the latter to stay intact. Within Japanese culture, the same principle is still at work. However, courtesy among all relationships seems to remain. The value of this restriction is to redefine existing relationships from a refreshing perspective...|$|R

This article discusses jurisdictions that have adopted a postmortem <b>right</b> <b>of</b> publicity, and advocates that Arkansas adopt a postmortem <b>right</b> <b>of</b> publicity for everyone. Specifically, the article argues that traditional protection stemming from actions for invasion <b>of</b> a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> privacy, trademark infringement, and copyright infringement cannot substitute for the protection afforded by a post-mortem <b>right</b> <b>of</b> publicity. Therefore, the article argues that a postmortem <b>right</b> <b>of</b> publicity should be descendible and inheritable as personal property upon the owner’s death. The article concludes that adopting a post-mortem <b>right</b> <b>of</b> publicity in Arkansas would protect Arkansans from use of their name, image, or likeness for commercial purposes without their consent...|$|R
