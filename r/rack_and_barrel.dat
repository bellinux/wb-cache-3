40|$|Surface Technology and in particular, Electroplating, is a key, {{across-the-board}} discipline {{without which}} {{the entire range of}} today's manufactured products would not exist. The formation of functional surfaces is a key to innovation in all branches of industry. In the realm of Electroplating, the use of pulsed deposition currents, known as "Pulse Plating" allows the production of a wider range of coating layers than those possible using DC, with extremely attractive functional properties. It is, however, the case that Pulse Plating is a knowledge-based technology. In order to exploit it to the full, a detailed knowledge of electrode kinetics and mass-transport in the electrolyte is essential. This volume, edited by two leading authorities in the field, presents the state-of-art knowledge of the science and the associated technology and equipment. Building on what was hitherto the standard work on the subject, written in the 1990 's, the current understanding of the basic principles is presented together with the full range of processes now available, within its 400 pages, in the English language. Significant developments within the field of Pulse Plating both from aqueous solutions and ionic liquids include the deposition of binary and ternary alloys, composite coatings, compositionally-graded coatings and multilayer coatings. Also described are nanocrystalline deposits and selective plating which is widely used in electronics manufacture and in high-rate deposition processes for coating semiconductors (electronics, solar cells [...] ). The technology is also used in anodic processes (oxidation, electrochemical machining, electropolishing etc). Following a forward-looking but also critical introductory chapter, the book falls into four sections covering all the basic principles and significant industrial applications of the technology. The first of these sections opens with an in-depth treatment of the thermodynamics and reaction kinetics of metal deposition at the metal-electrolyte interface. Special emphasis is laid on the kinetics of multi-step processes, on alloy deposition as well as the importance and modus operandi of additives, all of this supported with examples and documentation. Nucleation and growth processes in electrodeposition and formation of microstructure as well as nanocrystalline deposits using both DC and Pulse Plating are described. A systematic approach to the effect of additives, hitherto scarcely described in the literature, is also provided. The effect of Pulse Plating parameters on secondary current distribution (below the limiting current density) is critical. The use of simulation and modelling is also discussed, not least as used in an industrial setting. One important example of this is the modelling of copper electrodeposition for blind via filling. Of special importance in metal electrodeposition using Pulse Plating are phenomena at the electrode double layer in relation to mass transport and the effects of current pulsing on the double layer structure, which in turn, affects current efficiency. The effects of pulsed current on additives and microstructure as well as alloy deposition are also discussed. Finally, the various models used in simulation of metal and alloy electrodeposition are described. In the second section, various aspects and requirements for industrial applications of pulse electrodeposition are set out. Thanks to electronic and electrotechnical developments in modern power supplies, these can deliver any conceivable pulse regime in terms of current and rapid voltage transients such as square wave pulses. Where suitable equipment is installed, this ensures that the deposition process can be optimised. The means by which an understanding of basic principles can be harnessed to the practical electrodeposition of metals is shown with special emphasis on identification of key pulse plating parameters. Especially helpful in this respect is a systematic approach to determining these parameters for <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>barrel</b> plating. Finally, there is a consideration of the environmental aspects of pulse plating in terms of energy consumption and the related CO 2 emissions. The third section of the book covers in great depth, the industrial applications of pulse plating. Of these, the most important is currently copper electrodeposition for printed circuit board manufacture with special emphasis on Pulse Reverse Plating for through-hole contacting and filling of blind vias. It is in these particular applications that the strengths of Pulse Plating become especially evident. Also covered is the deposition of nickel and its alloys as well as the deposition of nickel-phosphorus deposits, electroforming and formation of nanocrystalline nickel layers. Other processes include electrodeposition of tin and its alloys and the broad topic of chromium plating for decorative or functional applications. The deposition of precious metals and their alloys is discussed and the section concludes with an in-depth treatment of zinc and zinc alloy deposition, especially zinc-nickel. The fourth and last section deals with special systems. This includes the use of pulsed current for anodising aluminium and its alloys, Electrochemical Machining (ECM) as well as electropolishing. Other applications include the deposition of nanostructured multilayers (CMM) and the potential applications of pulse plating for electrodeposition of composite coatings, especially those incorporating nano-sized second phase particles. The whole volume is systematically laid out with various aspects clearly classified. It leaves no doubt as to the huge potential of the method for future developments in electrochemical surface treatment and the associated equipment. This new work which will certainly become the accepted standard and is aimed not only at those researching new developments, but also at those working in an industrial setting and others seeking to acquire proficiency in the subject...|$|E

40|$|Five {{different}} types of feeders were designed and tested on goats to find out their effectiveness in reducing feed wastage and cost fabrication. Experiment was conducted at Agriculture Research Station (ARS) -Bandipur for two years. Tested feeders were hexagonal, rectangular, hay <b>rack,</b> chain <b>barrel</b> <b>and</b> conventional wooden Tatnu. Feeders were fabricated using iron bars and woods. They were tested with the adult goats for feed wastage and feed contamination. Experimental feeds were fodders twigs (Tanki), forage (Stylo, Napier), crop residue (straw from black bean) and commercial concentrate. Chain barrel type of feeder was also tested at farmer’s field at Baradi. Rectangular feeders have significantly lower (P< 0. 01) feed wastage (6. 61 % for fodders) compared to other tested feeders. The fabrication cost was NRs 3200, 1700, 700, 900, and 150 for hexagonal, rectangular; hay <b>rack,</b> chain <b>barrel</b> <b>and</b> conventional wooden Tatnu respectively. The rectangular feeder is suitable for goats feeding in Tarai and {{in the hills of}} Nepal. It has provision for feeding fodders, grasses, crop residues and concentrates together at the same time. Chain barrel type had comparatively higher wastage (10. 7 % for fodder) than the rectangular but was preferred by the farmers due to its low fabricating cost, portable in size, small space required and easy to handle. Therefore, the rectangular feeder is recommended for middle level farmers <b>and</b> chain <b>barrel</b> for small farmers who rear few goats...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to experimentally measure the aerodynamic properties of various commonly used vehicle add-ons (police siren, advertising sign, taxi sign <b>and</b> roof <b>rack)</b> <b>and</b> roof load (e. g., ladder <b>and</b> <b>barrel)</b> under a range of vehicle operating speeds and yaw angles using RMIT Industrial Wind Tunnel. The study was conducted using a reduced scale (25 %) detailed model of a production car manufactured in Australia. The results show that the vehicle add-ons have notable impact on aerodynamic drag as the can generate 5 to 40 % more aerodynamic drag depending on yaw angles. The taxi sign has minimum impact and the advertising sign has highest impact on aerodynamic drag. Also roof load such as ladder <b>and</b> <b>barrel</b> can significantly increase the drag. Furthermore, the aerodynamic drag was related to a range of commonly used fuels e. g., petrol, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefying petroleum gas (LPG) consumption and their relative greenhouse gas emiisions...|$|R

50|$|The grape {{harvest is}} done when the grapes are ripe and is done {{manually}} or mechanically. The manual harvest {{is for the}} most part sorted, either at the vineyard or at the cellar with a sorting table, thereby removing the rotten grapes or insufficiently mature ones. The manual harvest is usually broken and then placed in vats. Cold pre-fermentation maceration is sometimes carried out. The fermentation can now begin, usually after the application of yeast. Then begins the work of extracting the polyphenols (tannins, anthocyanins) and other qualitative aspects of the grape (polysaccharides etc.). The extraction is done by pigeage, an operation which consists in punching the cap into the fermenting juice using a wooden tool or nowadays a hydraulic system. More commonly, the extraction is conducted by reassemblies, an operation which involves pumping the juice {{from the bottom of the}} tank to water the cap and thus wash away the qualitative components of the grapes. The fermentation temperature may be higher or lower depending on the practices of each winemaker with an average of 28° to 35° at fermentation peak. Chaptalization is carried out if the natural alcohol content is not enough: this process is regulated. The alcoholic fermentation is followed by racking which produces free-run wine and press wine. The malolactic fermentation takes place after, but it is temperature-dependent. The wine is <b>racked</b> <b>and</b> placed in <b>barrels</b> or tanks for maturing. The maturing continues for several months (12 to 24 months) and the wine is refined, filtered and bottled.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In general, the {{strength}} of gears is calculated using the formula of AGMA or JGMA. But these formula can not be applied directly to {{the strength}} calculation of the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> pinion of steering gear assay, because of complex tooth and contact shapes. So Lewis bending stress and Hertzian contact stress formula are generally used {{for the design of}} <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> pinion of steering gear assay. But these formula do not also give the exact stress of <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> pinion. In this paper, comparing the finite element analysis results and the experimentally measured values, it is shown that the finite element modeling technique of the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> pinion of steering assay is reasonable.
