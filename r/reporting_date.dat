25|$|Spring {{training}} for the 2011 season officially got under way on February 16, 2011 when the pitchers and catchers reported to Camelback Ranch. One pitcher who did not report, however, was reliever Ronald Belisario. For the third season in a row, Belisario missed his <b>reporting</b> <b>date</b> due to visa problems in his home country. Belisario remained stuck in Venezuela indefinitely, missing the entire season. The Dodgers also made news {{on the first day}} of camp by naming Clayton Kershaw as the opening day starting pitcher. The Dodgers pitching depth took a major hit when Vicente Padilla underwent surgery to repair a radial nerve injury and Jon Garland suffered a strained oblique muscle. The spring training injury problems continued with both third baseman Casey Blake and catcher Dioner Navarro suffering injuries that would keep them off the opening day roster.|$|E
