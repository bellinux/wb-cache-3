40|$|In {{aquarium}} and {{sea cage}} experiments four wrasse species from Norwegian waters {{were identified as}} facultative cleaners, with lice infested salmon (Salmo salar) as the host: goldsinny (Ctenblabrus rupestris), <b>rock</b> <b>cook</b> (Centrolabrus exoletus), female cuckoo wrasse (Labrus ossifagus) and corkwing wrasse Crenilabrus melops). In this assumingly artificial cleaning symbiosis the wrasses played the active role while the salmon showed little response, neither aggressiveness nor invitation to cleaning. Experiments in sea cages have shown that wrasse might be utilized to control sea lice infestation on salmon postsmolts, {{as an alternative to}} treatment with chemicals...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} use of wrasses as {{cleaner fish}} in the salmon farming industry has created local fishery in many regions in Norway. In several cases, live fish have been transported between regions without knowledge of the population structure of the three species in question (goldsinny, Ctenolabrus rupestris, <b>rock</b> <b>cook,</b> Crenolabrus exoletus, and corkwing, Symphodus melops). Genetic studies based on variation in proteins were carried out, and polymorphic enzymes of potential use in popoulation studies were identified for all three species. For the most common wrasse the goldsinny, four loci (SDH- 1 *; PGM- 1 *; GPI- 1 * and GPI- 2 *) were used to study genetic variation between geographic regions. Five samples collected {{in the southern part}} of Norway were compared and significant variation in allele frequencies were detected for SDH- 1 * and PGM- 1 *. The variation seemed to be associated with specific fjord - coastal area distribution...|$|E
40|$|The salmonid {{industry}} in Norway has grown exponentially. The greatest cost and {{danger to the}} salmonid industry are ectoparasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). Sea lice attach to salmon causing damage and increasing health risks. Wrasse (Family: Labridae) provide a possible solution. Wrasse, specifically ballan, corkwing, goldsinny, and <b>rock</b> <b>cook,</b> are cleaner fish. They can be released into sea pens and will eat the sea lice off the salmon. This has been highly effective against sea lice. As a result wrasse have gone from a worthless fish (bony and not particularly tasty) to a highly desired multi-million kroner fishery. The growth of the fishery raises serious concerns. As a result of wrasse being unimportant until recently little information is known about them, including their reproductive habits. To provide further information regarding spawning and the stock of wrasse this project was developed to study the four economically important wrasse: ballan, corkwing, goldsinny, and <b>rock</b> <b>cook.</b> Over the space of two months in the spring/summer of 2014 I regularly participated in fishing expeditions with wrasse fisherman and research staff. The goal was {{to get a picture}} of the wrasse stock in Sunnhordaland and multiple sites were targeted. Data were collected in Austevoll (21 dates), Os (2 dates) and Sveio (3 dates). These 26 separate trips produced 4985 wrasse that were catalogued at sea. Of these, a sub-sample of 818 were euthanized and taken to the lab for analysis. Data on place, date, length, sex (when possible), and spawning behavior were collected on all fish observed in the field. There were a number of analyses done with the primary interest being first to accurately map the spawning patterns across the summer and to see how spawning behavior differed by species, size (length), across time and place, and by sex. The second dependent variable considered was sexual maturity. Most of these analyses required using the laboratory facilities for the sub-sample brought to the Institute for Marine Research in Austevoll. In the laboratory these 818 fish were dissected to extract the gonads to determine both sex and whether the individual was sexually mature. Furthermore otolith dating was used to determine the age of each individual fish. The spring of 2014 was warmer than average so spawning had already started for most species by the time I started collecting data in early May. Broadly speaking the data show spawning rising throughout May and into June, but then tapering off near the end of June and into July. As such the opening of the 2015 wrasse season for test fishing on July 1 st seems appropriate. In looking at the individual fish the patterns are largely consistent with the literature. There were some findings, however, that indicate there may be some stress on the stock. Chief among these were findings that both corkwing wrasse and goldsinny were noticeably smaller in size at maturity than what was predicted by the literature...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been a rapid {{increase}} in the use of wrasses as cleanerfish for sealice on salmon farms. During 2010, the landed catch of wrasse was 440 tons, more than twice the 2009 catch and nearly ten times the 2008 catch. This rapid and exrteme increase in the fishing pressure on these species has occurred despite very limited knowledge of their biology, ecology and population dynamics. This has led to justifiable concern about the sustainibility of this resource. Wrasse demonstrate specialized life history traits. Many species change sex during their lifetime and exhibit species-specific mating behaviour, including nest building and parental care of eggs. This mating strategy lends to limited dispersal of offspring, ond only goldsinny wrasse have pelagic eggs. Many adult individuals are stationary, thereby creating a population struction dominated by Iocal populations. This population structure is also documented through genetic sludies in corkwing and goldsinny wrasse. Small local populations are more vulnerable to overfishing and possible extinction of local genetic adaptations. Studies of growth of wild wrasse demonstrate that goldsinsy and <b>rock</b> <b>cook</b> grow slower than corkwing. This suggests that the first two will take longer to recover from heavy fishing pressure. Results presented here suggest that both the composition of species and the size distribution; vary between habitats, particularly between exposed and sheltered areas. More precise and complete information on population structure. growth and maturation of these species is required 10 provide the knowledge base for sustainable fishing. Better knowledge of the health and welfare of these species - in salmon co-culture scenarios - is also needed...|$|E

30|$|Although Type III kerogens are {{generally}} {{said to be}} of dominant gas potential, {{the fact that some}} renowned basins dominated by Types II–III and Type III kerogens have been known to yield giant liquid petroleum fields makes the onshore Central Sarawak be worthy of further exploratory investigations. This assertion is particularly true for the Cenozoic Niger Delta Basin of Nigeria, which is a world-class petroleum province with diverse giant oil fields discoveries. Several workers had reported dominance of Types II–III and III kerogens from the Agbada and Akata Shales, which are the two proven contributors of organic matter in the basin (Nwachukwu and Chukwura 1986; Bustin 1988; Haack et al. 2000; Eneogwe and Ekundayo 2003; Akinlua et al. 2005).

Unavailability of subsurface geochemical data from cuttings or cores in all available publications consulted for this research did not permit us to have a vertical variation of these geochemical parameters.

40|$|Summary of Lithologic, Geochemical, and Geophysical ResultsThis {{information}} circular {{is the fifth}} since 1980 {{to report on the}} basic results of test drilling (Fig. 1) by the Minnesota Geological Survey (MGS). As with the previous projects, this test drilling was conducted primarily to provide {{a better understanding of the}} Precambrian geology in areas of Minnesota where bedrock is covered by variable thicknesses of glaciogenic sediment, and thus could not be thoroughly mapped by standard outcrop mapping and sampling procedures. The drilling summarized here was conducted during 1989 - 1991 in areas where the bedrock is locally well exposed, but where exposures are separated by covered terrane. Thus, the selection of drill targets was constrained largely by the interpretation of geophysical surveys (Chandler, 1983 a, b). Our procedure is to formulate a regional geologic interpretation based on geophysical maps, new and existing outcrop data and the archived records of previous drilling, and then to constrain and test the interpretation by selective drilling. The results have been incorporated into new geologic maps of the region including Jirsa and others (1991) and Southwick (in prep.). An important secondary objective of this project is to describe the Quaternary deposits that overlie bedrock, though no systematic regional interpretation of those deposits has been undertaken to date.

40|$|Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HiRISE {{images and}} Opportunity rover {{observations}} of the ~ 22 km wide Noachian age Endeavour Crater on Mars show that the rim and surrounding terrains were densely fractured during the impact crater-forming event. Fractures have also propagated upward into the overlying Burns formation sandstones. Opportunity’s observations show that the western crater rim segment, called Murray Ridge, is composed of impact breccias with basaltic compositions, as well as occasional fracture-filling calcium sulfate veins. Cook Haven, a gentle depression on Murray Ridge, and the site where Opportunity spent its sixth winter, exposes highly fractured, recessive outcrops that have relatively high concentrations of S and Cl, consistent with modest aqueous alteration. Opportunity’s rover wheels serendipitously excavated and overturned several small <b>rocks</b> from a <b>Cook</b> Haven fracture zone.

These rocks have the highest concentrations of Mn and S measured to date by Opportunity and occur as a relatively bright sulfate-rich coating on basaltic rock, capped by a thin deposit {{of one or more}} dark Mn oxide phases intermixed with sulfate minerals. We infer from these unique Pinnacle Island and Stuart Island rock measurements that subsurface precipitation of sulfate-dominated coatings was followed by an interval of partial dissolution and reaction with one or more strong oxidants (e. g., O_ 2) to produce the Mn oxide mineral(s) intermixed with sulfate-rich salt coatings. In contrast to arid regions on Earth, where Mn oxides are widely incorporated into coatings on surface rocks, our results demonstrate that on Mars the most likely place to deposit and preserve Mn oxides was in fracture zones where migrating fluids intersected surface oxidants, forming precipitates shielded from subsequent physical erosion...|$|R
