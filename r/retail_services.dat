30|$|The {{proposition}} {{includes the}} result where the equilibrium peak-time retail electricity price becomes {{lower than the}} default price. Why should such a result occur? Larger α implies the wholesale electricity supply function is relatively flat. Remember that the retail electricity price depends on two factors, wholesale electricity price as a cost component and marginal <b>retail</b> <b>service</b> cost. While the wholesale electricity price becomes almost constant because of its flat supply function, marginal <b>retail</b> <b>service</b> cost diminished significantly after the system reform. The default retail electricity price could become higher for the remaining <b>retail</b> <b>service</b> cost. This is why the peak-time price becomes lower than the default price.|$|R

25|$|If {{significant}} use of bicycles {{for shopping}} trips {{is to be}} achieved, sufficient <b>retail</b> <b>services</b> must be maintained within reasonable cycling distances of residential areas. In countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany {{the high levels of}} utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle. It is arguable that this is related to policies that favour access to <b>retail</b> <b>services</b> by non-motorised modes. The Danish 1997 Planning Act requires that planning shall encourage a diverse mix of retail shops in small and medium-sized towns and in individual districts of large cities and ensure that retail trade uses will be placed in locations to which people have good access by walking, bicycling and public transport. From the mid-1970s the Netherlands has had policies in place to severely restrict the growth of large out-of-town retail developments. Germany has had federal planning regulations in place to restrict retail uses to designated areas since the 1960s. In addition, since the 1970s federal regulations have been in place specifying that developments above a certain size (1,200m²) be assessed regarding potential adverse effects. These federal regulations are further strengthened by regionally adopted regulations. This includes regulations specifying that new retail centres be limited to selling products not readily provided by shops at inner city/town centre locations. In Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany, this approach not restricted to planning guidelines and is also supported by a ban on below cost selling. This supports smaller shops by preventing large multiples from engaging in predatory pricing practices by aggressively discounting key goods to use as so called loss leaders.|$|E
