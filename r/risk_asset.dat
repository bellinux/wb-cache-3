40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} a risk-free {{protection}} index model for portfolio selection based on the uncertain theory. First, the returns of <b>risk</b> <b>assets</b> are assumed as uncertain variables and subject to reputable experts’ evaluations. Second, under this assumption, combining with the risk-free interest rate we define a risk-free protection index (RFPI), which can measure the protection degree when the loss of <b>risk</b> <b>assets</b> happens. Third, note that the proportion entropy serves as a complementary means {{to reduce the risk}} by the preset diversification requirement. We put forward a risk-free protection index model with an entropy constraint under an uncertainty framework by applying the RFPI, Huang’s risk index model (RIM), and mean-variance-entropy model (MVEM). Furthermore, to solve our portfolio model, an algorithm is given to estimate the uncertain expected return and standard deviation of different <b>risk</b> <b>assets</b> by applying the Delphi method. Finally, an example is provided to show that the risk-free protection index model performs better than the traditional MVEM and RIM...|$|R

To model the dynamics of loans, we introduce a modified CreditMetrics approach. This leads to development of a deterministic convex counterpart of capital to <b>risk</b> <b>asset</b> ratio chance constraint. We pursue the scope of analyzing our model under the worst-case scenario i.e. loan default. The theoretical model is analyzed by applying numerical procedures, in order to administer valuable insights from a financial outlook. Our results suggest that, our capital to <b>risk</b> <b>asset</b> ratio chance-constrained optimization model guarantees banks of meeting capital requirements of Basel III with a likelihood of 95  % irrespective of changes in future market value of assets.|$|E

The number of elements in the study sample was 25 companies from 2009 to 2011 to obtain a 75 -year observation data. The results obtained coefficients greatest effect on the capital structure of the company is manufacturing in IDX profitability. Business <b>risk,</b> <b>asset</b> growth, profitability, and time greatly affect the interest earned on the capital structure of manufacturing companies on the Stock Exchange reached 41. 4 percent and the remaining 58. 6 percent is influenced by other variables outside the model of this study. The test results using the t-test test showed that business <b>risk,</b> <b>asset</b> growth, profitability, and time interest earned partially significant effect on the capital structure on manufacturing companies on the Stock Exchange. Testing using the F-test tests showed that business <b>risk,</b> <b>asset</b> growth, profitability, and time interest earned simultaneously significant effect on the capital structure of manufacturing companies on the Stock Exchange. From the research, it turns out that the coefficient of the effect on the capital structure was variable profitability therefore the expected future profitability can be utilized with probably due to becoming one of the most influential factors to the increase in the dividend.

It aims at obtaining the explicit optimal control strategy and the optimal value function. Applying stochastic control technique of jump diffusion, a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is established. Moreover, we show that a closed-form solution for the HJB equation can be found by maximizing the insurer’s exponential utility of terminal wealth with the independence of two Brownian motions W(t) and W 1 (t). A verification theorem is also proved to verify that the solution of HJB equation is indeed a solution of this optimal control problem. Then, we quantitatively analyze the effect of different parameter impacts on optimal control strategy and the optimal value function, which show that optimal control strategy is decreasing with the initial wealth x and decreasing with the volatility rate of <b>risk</b> <b>asset</b> price. However, the optimal value function V(t;x;s) is increasing with the appreciation rate μ of <b>risk</b> <b>asset...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to measure the welfare costs of {{business}} cycles in a production economy in which the representative agent has low risk aversion and - at the same time - the equity premium and the co-movements of aggregate quantities and market returns are comparable to what observed in historical data. In order to do so, I consider a production economy in which the representative agent has Epstein-Zin-Weil(1989) preferences, productivity has a Long Run Risk component and there are capital adjustment costs. In this way, I try to bridge the gap between the current Long Run <b>Risk</b> <b>asset</b> pricing literature, in which quantities are taken as exogenous, and the standard macroeconomic business cycle models. Preliminary results from a benchmark exchange economy suggest that when there is a Long Run Consumption Risk and the representative agent prefers early resolution of uncertainty, the implied total welfare costs of the consumption uncertainty range from 12 % to 20 %.
