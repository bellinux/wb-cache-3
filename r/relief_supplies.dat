40|$|Sample {{selection}} models {{attempt to}} correct for non-randomly selected {{data in a}} two-model hierarchy where, on the first level, a binary selection equation determines whether a particular observation {{will be available for}} the second level, i. e. in the outcome equation. Ignoring the non-random selection mechanism that is induced by the selection equation may result in biased estimation of the coefficients in the outcome equation. In the application that motivated this research, we analyse <b>relief</b> <b>supply</b> in earthquake-affected communities in Pakistan, where the decision to deliver goods represents the dependent variable in the selection equation whereas factors that determine the amount of goods supplied are analysed in the outcome equation. In this application, the inclusion of spatial effects is necessary since the available covariate information on the community level is rather scarce. Moreover, the high temporal dynamics underlying the immediate delivery of <b>relief</b> <b>supply</b> after a natural disaster calls for non-linear, time varying effects. We propose a geoadditive sample selection model that allows us to address these issues in a general Bayesian framework with inference being based on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The model proposed is studied in simulations and applied to the <b>relief</b> <b>supply</b> data from Pakistan. Copyright (c) 2010 Royal Statistical Society. ...|$|R
5|$|On October31, a {{disaster}} declaration was signed for Honduras {{due to the}} effects from Beta.

Two Fokker F27 aircraft were also supplied to help assist the transportation of <b>relief</b> <b>supplies</b> at a cost of $40,000. The United States Department of Defense sent military personnel to the affected areas from November4–8. During that time, more than 155,000lb (70,306kg) of <b>relief</b> <b>supplies</b> were airlifted to the affected communities. The United States embassy in Honduras also provided a C-12 Huron aircraft to transport 3,000lb (1,360kg) to Puerto Lempira. A total of $500,000 was sent in the form of <b>relief</b> <b>supplies</b> and transport to Honduras from USAID. The Spanish Government offered a C-130 Hercules containing emergency supplies to Honduras. The World Food Programme pre-positioned 509tons (461.7tonnes) of food to be used in temporary shelters and recovery activities. The government of Great Britain offered humanitarian assistance, consisting of 1,500 plastic bags, 1,800 jerrycans, one helicopter, five boats, 250 military personnel, and five medical assistants.|$|E

40|$|Humanitarian <b>relief</b> <b>supply</b> {{chains are}} not well documented. This thesis {{describes}} humanitarian <b>relief</b> <b>supply</b> chains in general and those specifically utilized in the 2004 South East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami relief effort. A survey, created {{in collaboration with the}} Fritz Institute and KPMG, informed the analysis and establishes baseline data for a sector with little formal measurement. It was found that relief organizations share common problems regardless of size, focus, or structure. While the survey determined that relief delivery was effective, the findings illuminated deficiencies in the following areas: initial assessment, collaboration, trained logistics experts, and supply chain analysis. Finally, the thesis suggests plans to address these issues and future research. by Timothy Edward Russell. Thesis (M.

5|$|The local Red Cross {{offices in}} Port Vila and Luganville {{prepared}} general <b>relief</b> <b>supplies</b> before the storm's arrival, including tents, tool kits, and first aid units. By {{four days after}} the cyclone's passage, the main wharf in Port Vila was re-opened and the two sunken boats were removed. Additionally, the evacuees were allowed to return to their homes, and communications between the various islands were restored. The Red Cross distributed various <b>relief</b> <b>supplies</b> to the affected citizens, including candles, matches, water, and blankets. By about two weeks after the storm, about 30,000household relief packages were distributed. The Vanuatu government allocated VT25million (2004VUV, $236,000 2004USD) for the affected citizens. Overall, the cyclone severely affected the daily lives of the Vanuatu citizens. On Tanna island, the cyclone's passage produced a malaria outbreak.|$|E
5|$|A U.S. Navy relief {{plane was}} sent to Chetumal, Mexico, to deliver food and other <b>relief</b> <b>supplies</b> after Janet struck the region. In areas {{previously}} affected by hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year, federal relief agencies were ordered to extend relief operations to the Yucatán Peninsula. However, after crossing the Bay of Campeche and making landfall near Veracruz, relief measures were once again implemented in the western Gulf Coast of Mexico. The Mexican Air Force, commercial and private planes, and helicopters were sent to bring <b>relief</b> <b>supplies</b> and airlift refugees. The United States initiated the largest relief campaign ever staged in Mexico at the time. Various government and relief agencies, including the American Red Cross and The Salvation Army, participated in the relief efforts. The United States Air Force and United States Army began a joint-relief operation to send <b>relief</b> <b>supplies</b> to the Tampico area, beginning with the deployment of a Curtiss C-46 Commando from the Harlingen Air Force Base on October1. Ten other military transport aircraft from the United States Air Force were sent from Texas to provide food and clothing. Pan American World Airways sent a Boeing 314 from Miami, Florida to evacuate victims. Helicopters were sent from the USS Saipan to transfer food and medical supplies from the light aircraft carrier. Other ships also aided in delivering supplies, including the USS Siboney, which also deployed helicopters to assist in relief efforts. By October6, 1,500people were estimated to have been rescued from the Tampico area, and at least 280,000lb (130,000kg) of food and clothing materials were estimated to have been delivered by the US Air Force to the city. There, typhoid serum shots were administered as a precautionary measure.

40|$|Post-disaster housing {{reconstruction}} projects face several challenges. Resources {{and material}} supplies are often scarce; several and {{different types of}} organizations are involved, while projects must be completed {{as quickly as possible}} to foster recovery. Within this context, the chapter aims to increase the understanding of <b>relief</b> <b>supply</b> chain design in reconstruction. In addition, the chapter is introducing a community based and beneficiary perspective to <b>relief</b> <b>supply</b> chains by evaluating the implications of local components for supply chain design in reconstruction. This is achieved through the means of secondary data analysis based on the evaluation reports of two major housing reconstruction projects that took place in Europe the last decade. A comparative analysis of the organizational designs of these projects highlights the ways in which users can be involved. The performance of reconstruction supply chains seems to depend to a large extent on the way beneficiaries are integrated in supply chain design impacting positively on the effectiveness of reconstruction supply chains...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Disaster is {{a natural}} or human-caused event which causes {{intensive}} negative impacts on people, goods, services and/or the environment, exceeding the affected community's capability to respond. A supply chain, or supply network is a coordinated system of organizations, people, activities, information and resources involved in moving a product or service in physical or virtual manner from supplier to customer. Customer in case of disaster are people facing the crisis. The application of humanitarian supply chain in real life involves study of the critical factors or enablers and their effect along the supply chain. In order to gain proper advantage of <b>relief</b> <b>supply</b> chain, it is required to find the structural relationship between these enablers. The purpose of the paper is to identify the key enablers of Humanitarian Supply chain and find the structural relationship between them. In this paper, a framework is developed using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) is used to find the structural relationship between the enablers along <b>relief</b> <b>supply</b> chain...|$|R

5|$|With {{effect from}} June 12, {{a state of}} public {{emergency}} was declared {{for the whole of}} Tuvalu, by the then Governor-General of Tuvalu, Sir Tulaga Manuella. This was because there was only a limited amount of food available on Funafuti to cater for the whole of the island nation, while providing Niulakita with immediate <b>relief</b> <b>supplies.</b> This enabled the Tuvaluan embassy in Suva, Fiji to appeal to various overseas countries and organisations including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United Nations Development Programme to provide aid and assistance to the island nation. During June 14, the Royal New Zealand Air Force deployed a transport plane carrying some relief materials including tarpaulins and water from New Zealand. The plane subsequently stopped in Noumea, New Caledonia and Nadi, Fiji to pick up further <b>relief</b> <b>supplies</b> that had been donated by Australia, Fiji and France.
