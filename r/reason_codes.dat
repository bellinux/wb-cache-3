In this report I analyzed nearly 8400 modifications in over 2200 completed Navy construction contracts from Southern Division of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command {{to identify the}} most frequent and expensive categories. Using the modification reason code, the modifications were divided into 20 categories {{and the effect of}} each of these categories was determined quantitatively. The data, which I found was not normally distributed, was run three ways: (1) Unadjusted; (2) Adjusted for planned or expected modifications; (3) Adjusted for planned or expected modifications and terminated contracts.

40|$|Change orders {{represent}} {{a cost to}} the State and to tax payers that often extremely large because contractors tend to charge very large amounts to any additional work that deviates from the work that was originally planned. Therefore, efforts {{must be made to}} reduce the occurrence of change orders in order to provide significant cost savings to the state of Indiana and save taxpayer dollars. The proposed research, in this context, developed a set of guidelines to allow the geotechnical office of the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) to minimize the probability of having geotechnical change orders, based on analysis of past data and interviews with INDOT personnel. From 300 INDOT contracts, {{it was found that the}} average geotechnical change order amount per district per year was 1. 34 percent of the total estimated construction cost per district per year. The average geotechnical change order amount per district per year was 10. 25 percent of the average amount of total change orders per district per year. 28 percent of the contracts experienced geotechnical change orders. 41 % of the total road contracts experienced geotechnical change orders.

40|$|The Oxford {{dictionary}} defines code as "a body of laws so {{related to}} each other as to avoid inconsistency and overlapping". It is obvious that natural language with its high degree of ambiguity does not qualify as a code in the sense of this definition. Everyday experiences provide ample evidence that natural language, because of its richness and lack of uniqueness, is subject to multiple interpretations and thus not suitable for conveying ideas or data in an unequivocal, uniform and concise manner. For this <b>reason</b> <b>codes</b> have been developed and used in several areas of medicine [1 - 3] to describe, document, and transmit qualitative medical data. It is rather surprising that electrocardiography has been able to exist for so long without any formalized language to describe its findings. Increased use of electrocardiograms in epidemiology, large scale electrocardiographic studies and last but not least computerized EeG interpretation have provided incentives to develop codes. Initial efforts in this direction [4 - 6] were primarily guided by loc al needs for improved storage, retrieval and handling of information; without major modifications they do not, however, satisfy all the requirements one expects from an EeG code today. Nevertheless, the experience gained in the use of these early EeG codes provides an important source of information on which to build specifications for a new or expanded code. It is significant that several members of this working group have been extensive users of the Booth-Hull code [4] and the Utrecht coding system [5]...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Concurrent error {{detection}} (CED) is {{the detection of}} errors or faults in a circuit or data path concurrent with normal operation of that circuit. The general approach for CED is to calculate a check symbol for the inputs to the circuit under operation, predict the check symbol that will result for {{the output of the}} circuit for those inputs, and compare the predicted check symbol to the one that is actually calculated for the output. If the predicted and actual check symbols are different, an error or fault has been detected. The alternative to this check symbol prediction is to use a second copy of the circuit under operation and compare the results of the two circuits. For some classes of circuits the prediction of the output check symbol can require less circuitry than a second copy of the circuit being tested. Four examples of these types of circuits are examined in this dissertation: Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs), array multipliers, self-synchronous scrambler-descrambler pairs with their intervening data path, and switch fabrics. Faults in integrated circuits tend to produce unidirectional errors. Unidirectional errors are those in which all of the errors are in the same direction (e. g., 0 to 1 errors) within the block of data covered by a given check symbol. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>codes</b> that are optimized for unidirectional errors are the focus of investigation for most of the applications. In particular, the Bose-Lin codes are examined for those applications where unidirectional errors are expected to be typical. In order to examine the performance of the Bose-Lin codes in one of these applications, it was necessary to determine the theoretical performance for Bose- Lin codes for error rates beyond what had been previously studied. This analysis of Bose-Lin codes with large numbers of "burst" errors also included a further generalization of the codes...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, rates of {{sickness}} absence have increased and psychiatric disorders {{have become an}} important cause of sickness absence. The socio-demographic associations for psychiatric sickness absence are reported from the Whitehall II study, a longitudinal survey of 10, 308 London-based male and female civil servants between 35 - 55 years. Short spells ([less-than-or-equals, slant] 7 days), long spells (> 7 days) and very long spells (> 21 days) of sickness absence were examined in 5620 civil servants for whom reason for absence was available in civil service records. Civil service coding of reasons for absence was validated against report of general practitioners' diagnoses. Psychiatric disorder, largely neurosis and neurosis ill-defined, was the third {{most common cause of}} long spells of sickness absence in women and the fourth most common in men. For both men and women it was the second most common cause of very long spells of absence. Psychiatric sickness absence for short, long and very long spells was more frequent in lower employment grades than higher employment grades in keeping with the pattern for other illnesses. This partly explains the higher rate of sickness absence in women than men. Widowed and single men, and divorced women had high rates of psychiatric sickness absence. Comparing <b>reason</b> <b>codes</b> based on sickness certificates with general practitioners reports, there appeared to be evidence of under-reporting of psychosis on certificates. The general rise in levels of sickness absence and in particular psychiatric sickness absence may have several explanations: increased recognition of psychiatric disorder; greater reporting of psychiatric disorder; a real increase in the incidence of psychiatric disorder; or a change in employment opportunities for individuals with minor psychiatric disorder. The contribution of psychiatric disorder to the overall burden of sickness absence is likely to be underestimated. It is argued that greater preventative effort examining working conditions and social supports and earlier recognition and treatment of existing psychiatric disorder will lead to a reduction in sickness absence. sickness absence psychiatric disorder social neurosis...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is a theoretical, experimental and numerical {{study of the}} one-dimensional deformation of suspensions. The study is focussed on the transition between sedimentation and consolidation, and creep during soil consolidation. In the literature, sedimentation, traditional large strain consolidation and creep are explored independently. The theory of sedimentation has been derived in parallel with the mathematical description of shock waves. The large strain consolidation theory of Gibson et al. (1981) has been adopted, and attention {{is given to the}} material properties of compressibility and permeability. Traditionally creep has been studied on thin samples, and a review is given to identify parallels with creep behaviour of the thick samples studied here. The experimental work was carried out in the laboratory using settling column tests. During the sedimentation stage, when the soil particles are fluid supported, shock waves were monitored and tracked by means of an X-ray absorption technique to allow for the calculation of experimental flux functions. Settling column experiments on different natural soils have been performed to study the consolidation behaviour by means of the measurement of pore water pressure and X-ray density measurements. An in-depth study of the development of effective stress has been performed to quantify the creep behaviour of the soils studied in a strain rate surface. The sedimentation equation is classified as a hyperbolic partial differential equation. In this kind of equation, discontinuities can propagate, and standard solution methods, eg finite differences, fail to give adequate results. For this <b>reason</b> <b>codes</b> have been developed using the finite volume method (FVM) to solve the sedimentation equation numerically. A standard numerical code has been developed for the solution of the large strain consolidation equation, while for the unified sedimentation-consolidation model the finite volume method (FVM) has been used. The shock waves monitored in the experiments are successfully predicted by the sedimentation model using experimentally derived flux functions. This study made it possible to formulate a physically and mathematically correct definition of the transition from sedimentation to consolidation. The strengths and weaknesses of the traditional large strain consolidation model have been identified by means of an international Class A prediction seminar. A new unified sedimentation-consolidation model is proposed using a flux function, a permeability relationship and a strain rate surface as material functions. Successful predictions of experiments have been performed, showing the transition from sedimentation to consolidation and the inclusion of creep.
