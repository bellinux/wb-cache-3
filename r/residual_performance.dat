50|$|Visual {{processing}} in {{the brain}} goes {{through a series of}} stages. Destruction of the primary visual cortex leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the damaged cortical representation. The area of blindness - known as a scotoma - is in the visual field opposite the damaged hemisphere and can vary from a small area up to the entire hemifield. Visual processing occurs {{in the brain}} in a hierarchical series of stages (with much crosstalk and feedback between areas). The route from the retina through V1 is not the only visual pathway into the cortex, though it is by far the largest; it is commonly thought that the <b>residual</b> <b>performance</b> of people exhibiting blindsight is due to preserved pathways into the extrastriate cortex that bypass V1. What is surprising is that activity in these extrastriate areas is apparently insufficient to support visual awareness in the absence of V1.|$|E

40|$|Rebar {{corrosion}} is {{the most}} frequent cause of deterioration in reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Corrosion damage can adversely affect the material and bond properties in RC, which may lead to premature in-service failures. Several studies have investigated the effects of corrosion on the <b>residual</b> <b>performance</b> of RC elements, such as under-reinforced beams; however a significant scatter is observed in the available experimental data. Lack of consistent interpretation of the available data is a major hurdle in reaching reliable conclusions on the behaviour of corroding members, leading to conservative estimation of their <b>residual</b> <b>performance</b> during assessment. In this paper, the performance of corroding under-reinforced beams is investigated using the response surface method (RSM), in which non-linear finite element analysis (NLFEA) serves as “numerical experiments”. Corrosion damage is taken into account using empirical/semi-empirical models derived from the experimental data. Low-order polynomial (RSM) models are obtained for the load at serviceability limit deflection, yield-load capacity, and displacement ductility factor (μδ) of the corroding beams, using suitable experimental designs. Results of an extensive parametric study are presented using the developed RSM models, which quantified the influence of several input variables on the predicted responses.

40|$|The {{potential}} of post-tensioned self-centering moment-resisting frames (SC-MRFs) and viscous dampers {{to reduce the}} collapse risk and improve the <b>residual</b> drift <b>performance</b> of steel buildings in near-fault regions is evaluated. For this purpose, a prototype steel building is designed using different seismic-resistant frames, i. e. : moment-resisting frames (MRFs); MRFs with viscous dampers; SC-MRFs; and SC-MRFs with viscous dampers. The frames are modeled in OpenSees where material and geometrical nonlinearities {{are taken into account}} as well as stiffness and strength deterioration. A database of 91 near-fault, pulse-like ground motions with varying pulse periods is used to conduct incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), in which each ground motion is scaled until collapse occurs. The probability of collapse and the probability of exceeding different residual story drift threshold values are calculated {{as a function of the}} ground motion intensity and the period of the velocity pulse. The results of IDA are then combined with probabilistic seismic hazard analysis models that account for near-fault directivity to assess and compare the collapse risk and the <b>residual</b> drift <b>performance</b> of the frames. The paper highlights the benefit of combining the post-tensioning and supplemental viscous damping technologies in the near-source. In particular, the SC-MRF with viscous dampers is found to achieve significant reductions in collapse risk and probability of exceedance of residual story drift threshold values compared to the MRF. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrech...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Structural {{methods in}} model-based fault {{diagnosis}} applications are simple and efficient tools for finding candidates for residual generation. However, the structural methods {{do not take}} model uncertainties and information about fault behavior into consideration.

By using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the performance of different residual generators can be compared to find the best one. With the ability to quantify diagnostic performance, the design of residual generators can be optimized by, for example, combining several residual generators such that the diagnostic performance is maximized.

30|$|Many seismic {{assessment}} {{methods for}} buildings {{have been developed}} in recent years (ATC 1996; FEMA 1998, 2000); however, those methods seldom mention re-evaluating the seismic residual of earthquake-damaged buildings. Di Ludovico et al. (2013) proposed the experiment-based expressions of modification factors for stiffness, strength and displacement capacity {{as a function of}} the rotational ductility demand. Additionally, the proposed expressions can be introduced to modify the moment-rotation plastic hinges of RC columns in the buildings of Mediterranean regions with design characteristics non-conforming to present-day seismic provisions. However, how to apply the modification factors for stiffness, strength and displacement capacity in the seismic performance assessment is not mentioned clearly in the paper. The guidelines developed by JBDPA (2001, 2015) for evaluating the <b>residual</b> seismic <b>performance</b> of earthquake-damaged buildings can be used to determine the damage class of a building; however, the procedure is only suitable for the preliminary seismic performance assessment. Restated, a preliminary seismic performance assessment does not provide sufficient data for engineers or users to make decisions on earthquake-damaged buildings. Additionally, for the detailed seismic performance assessment of low-rise RC building structures in Taiwan, engineers need to use the nonlinear static analysis method, which is different with the method proposed in the JBDPA guidelines (2001, 2015). Therefore, a post-earthquake detailed assessment method of seismic performance is needed to evaluate the <b>residual</b> seismic <b>performance</b> of an earthquake-damaged RC building for the post-earthquake maintenance strategy.|$|R

40|$|Keefe, MichaelIt is {{well known}} that {{laminated}} composite materials are susceptible to damage by out-of-plane impact, often associated with a corresponding reduction of mechanical properties. Much research has been conducted to characterize the impact and post-impact response of various composite systems, but little attention has been given to the proximity effects of repeated impacts. Structural composite panels developed for military vehicles must survive numerous impacts of various energies with distinct damage characteristics. The size, number, and proximity of these events may have a unique influence on the structure‟s <b>residual</b> <b>performance.</b> A series of low-velocity drop-weight impact tests were conducted on S- 2 glass/epoxy samples simply-supported along two edges. Three single-impact energies were used to determine the effect of damage size on the <b>residual</b> <b>performance.</b> Two of those energies were used to study the effect of impact proximity; 0. 5 in and 2 in distances separated the two impacts. Along with damage size, the residual compressive strength and flexural properties were measured. An elastic finite element model was developed to approximate the impact damage as an elliptical inclusion. The damaged modulus and inclusion dimensions were used to uniquely determine the inclusion stiffness. The corresponding stress concentration was then used to predict the experimental loss of strength. Increasing incident impact energies exhibited greater absorbed energy, associated with larger damage dimensions. Post-impact tests and stress analyses revealed that both damage size and inclusion stiffness are related to the extent of overall structural degradation. Thus, simply considering the damage to be a hole may be overly conservative. Multiple impact tests showed that when separated by 2 in, the initial impact damage does not influence the material‟s response during a second impact. At 0. 5 in, however, the damage areas significantly overlap, increasing the absorbed energy and degree of damage. This correlated to a significant loss of flexural modulus and strength as well as compressive strength. With these results it seems that a multiple non-coincident impact method could potentially gauge the damage tolerance of various composite systems. Also, it is feasible to model the damage dimensions and elastic flexural modulus as a nondestructive means to reasonably predict the residual flexural and compressive strength.

The Global Plan for Insecticide Resistance Management (GPIRM) recommends rotation of non-pyrethroid insecticides for indoor residual spraying (IRS). The options from other classes are limited. The carbamate bendiocarb and the organophosphate pirimiphos-methyl (p-methyl) emulsifiable concentrate (EC) {{have a short}} residual duration of action, resulting in increased costs due to multiple spray cycles, and user fatigue. Encapsulation (CS) technology was used to extend the <b>residual</b> <b>performance</b> of p-methyl. Two novel p-methyl CS formulations were evaluated alongside the existing EC in laboratory bioassays and experimental hut trials in Tanzania between 2008 - 2010. Bioassays were carried out monthly on sprayed substrates of mud, concrete, plywood, and palm thatch to assess residual activity. Experimental huts {{were used to assess}} efficacy against wild free-flying Anopheles arabiensis, in terms of insecticide-induced mortality and blood-feeding inhibition. In laboratory bioassays of An. arabiensis and Culex quinquefasciatus both CS formulations produced high rates of mortality for significantly longer than the EC formulation on all substrates. On mud, the best performing CS killed > 80 % of An. arabiensis for five months and > 50 % for eight months, compared with one and two months, respectively, for the EC. In monthly bioassays of experimental hut walls the EC was ineffective shortly after spraying, while the best CS formulation killed more than 80 % of An. arabiensis for five months on mud, and seven months on concrete. In experimental huts both CS and EC formulations killed high proportions of free-flying wild An. arabiensis for up to 12 months after spraying. There {{was no significant difference between}} treatments. All treatments provided considerable personal protection, with blood-feeding inhibition ranging from 9 - 49 % over time.

In the Italian context there are many examples of structures that have already exceeded their service life, considering not only the ancient buildings but also infrastructures and R/C buildings that today are operating from more than 50 th years. Climate change which is subject to the entire planet, with changing in seasonal weather and increasing in environmental pollution, is not excluded could have a harmful influence on the rate of building materials decay previously deemed as durables. If the aggressive input changes very fast, for example in a few decades, then it can also change the response of a construction material considered so far durable; in this way the knowledge about the art of good build, consolidated over the centuries, is thwarted. Hence this study is focused on the possibility to define the residual capacity for vertical or seismic loads for structures that are already at the limit of their service life, or for which is impossible to define a service life. The problem in an analysis of this kind, and that is what makes this research different from the main studies avaibles in the literature, is to keep in correlation – in a not so expensive computationally way – issues such as: - dangerous environmental inputs adequately simulated; - environmental conditions favorable to the spread of pollutants and development of the degradation reactions (decay’s speed); - link between environmental degradation and residual bearing capacity A more realistic assessment of materials <b>residual</b> <b>performances</b> that constitute the structure allows to leave the actual system for the residual load-bearing capacity estimation in which all factors are simply considered {{through the use of a}} safety factor on the materials properties. ...|$|R
