40|$|River oases at the {{southern}} fringe of the Taklamakan desert in NW China are surrounded by belts of spontaneous vegetation that protect the oases from sand drift. As {{an important source of}} forage, fuel and construction wood, this foreland vegetation is also a component part of the agricultural system of the oases but has been, and still is, destroyed through overuse. Within a broader study that aimed to provide a basis for a sustainable management of this foreland vegetation, biomass and production were studied in four vegetation types dominated either by Alhagi sparsifolia, Calligonum caput-medusae, Populus euphratica, or Tamarix ramosissima that were thought to occur under different regimes of natural flooding in the foreland of Qira (Cele) oasis, Xinjiang, NW China. Shoot biomass components were closely correlated to basal area (Calligonum, Populus, Tamarix) or shrub volume and projection area (Alhagi), enabling non-destructive estimation of stand biomass from shoot diameters or shrub dimensions with sufficient precision using allometric regression equations. Relationships between shoot basal area and biomass of the woody species (Calligonum, Populus and Tamarix) agreed with predictions by a theoretical model of plant vascular systems, suggesting that they are determined by hydraulic and mechanical requirements for shoot architecture. Average aboveground biomass densities of typical stands in late summer were 2. 97 Mg/ha in Alhagi, 3. 6 Mg/ha in a <b>row</b> <b>plantation</b> and 10. 9 Mg/ha in homogenous stands of Calligonum, 22 - 29 Mg/ha in 22 year-old Populus forests and 1. 9 - 3. 1 Mg/ha in Tamarix-dominated vegetation. Annual aboveground production including wood and assimilation organs ranged from 2. 11 to 11. 3 Mg/ha in plantations of Calligonum, 3. 17 to 6. 12 Mg/ha in Populus, and 1. 55 to 1. 74 Mg/ha (based on total ground area) or 3. 10 to 7. 15 Mg/ha (in homogenous stands) in Tamarix. Production of Alhagi is equal to peak biomass. A thinning treatment simulating use by the local population enhanced productivity of Calligonum, Populus and Tamarix. A complete harvest of Alhagi in late August decreased production in the following year. An artificial flood irrigation treatment did not sufficiently increase soil water content except in the uppermost layer and had no clear beneficial effect on growth of the four species and even a negative effect on Alhagi, which was due to increased competition from annual species. As biomass and production with or without artificial irrigation were much higher than values expected for rain-fed desert vegetation at a mean annual precipitation of 35 mm, it is concluded that the existence of all vegetation types studied is probably based on permanent access to groundwater and that natural floods or precipitation do not contribute to their water supply. The effects of agricultural groundwater use in the oasis on groundwater in the foreland of the oasis need further study. Sustainable use of this productive vegetation is possible but requires proper management...|$|E

5000|$|Less {{common than}} clumped distribution, uniform distribution, {{also known as}} even distribution, is evenly spaced. Uniform {{distributions}} are found in populations in which the distance between neighboring individuals is maximized. The need to maximize the space between individuals generally arises from competition for a resource such as moisture or nutrients, or {{as a result of}} direct social interactions between individuals within the population, such as territoriality. For example, penguins often exhibit uniform spacing by aggressively defending their territory among their neighbors. The burrows of great gerbils for example are also regularly distributed, which can be seen on satellite images. Plants also exhibit uniform distributions, like the creosote bushes in the southwestern region of the United States. Salvia leucophylla is a species in California that naturally grows in uniform spacing. This flower releases chemicals called terpenes which inhibit the growth of other plants around it and results in uniform distribution. [...] This is an example of allelopathy, which is the release of chemicals from plant parts by leaching, root exudation, volatilization, residue decomposition and other processes. Allelopathy can have beneficial, harmful, or neutral effects on surrounding organisms. Some allelochemicals even have selective effects on surrounding organisms; for example, the tree species Leucaena leucocephala exudes a chemical that inhibits the growth of other plants but not those of its own species, and thus can affect the distribution of specific rival species. Allelopathy usually results in uniform distributions, and its potential to suppress weeds is being researched. [...] Farming and agricultural practices often create uniform distribution in areas where it would not previously exist, for example, orange trees growing in <b>rows</b> on a <b>plantation.</b>|$|R

Achieving food security, meeting the demand for sufficient food production to cater to the growing demographic pressures the competitive demand for water and its scarcity, calls for consideration of the fact that good, productive lands used for food production cannot be diverted for Jatropha and Pongamia cultivation. Results from literature also suggest that when Jatropha is grown on good quality lands, with irrigation and intercropping with baby corn, it is not economically superior to the sole cultivation of baby corn. In order to improve livelihoods of the rural poor by providing opportunities for additional income from Jatropha and Pongamia plantations, ICRISAT in partnership with Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) has developed a model to rehabilitate degraded common lands in a village. Three hundred ha of Jatropha plantation, which is three years old, I,as stOlied producing yield. The grain yield fram the third year onwards was 100 kg per ha and was expected to reach upto 1000 kg per ha by the sixth year. Growing intercrops on areas where good soil existed provided additional income for the farmers. The Jatropha and Pongamia plantations on waste lands have not only created employment in the rural areas but also provided additional sources of income through usufruct rights, by selling Jatropha seeds. Other impacts in terms of social capital development, building of institutions in the villages, improving soil health through recycling 01 organic matter and enhanced soil water conservation measures, reduced soil erosion and land degradation were also recorded. With the unique institutional mechanisms adopted in this model for development of CPRs through collective action, landless people were organized into self- help groups and took up labour work in the development of degraded common property resources, such as soil and water conservation measures, supported by the project.

40|$|Plant {{production}} systems {{are governed by}} site management and by biotic and abiotic factors. For annual crops, many of these have been described, modeled and used {{as a basis for}} production steering. Existing biophysical production models however lack components for the correct modeling of fruit crops, such as integrated submodels for flowering and fruit growth, adaptation and carbohydrate allocation. Dynamic inputs to these models are being delivered by meteorological records and - increasingly - by remote sensing due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. Specifically hyperspectral satellite data sets offer a high added value as they are capable of detecting a large number of relevant biophysical variables, such as leaf area index, chlorophyll content, soil and crown water content, pigment ratios and biomass production. The major scientific challenge is the robust and unbiased extraction of these variables and their subsequent assimilation in production models. The first objective of this dissertation, throughout which citrus is used as a model crop, is the development of a bottom-up approach to model, at the different scales, the physiological, structural and optical processes leading to changes in signals as retrieved by hyperspectral satellites. The first step herein encompasses a description of the critical internal processes that lead to detectable changes in biochemical components with a focus on the carbohydrate flows (chapter 2). In the second step, a dorsiventral leaf model (DLM) is developed (chapter 3) capable of accurately simulating optical properties (reflectance and transmittance) of leaves with known structural properties and biochemical composition. Contrary to existing isolateral leaf models, DLM is adapted to model dorsiventral leaves, typical for dicot species such as citrus. The next step in the up-scaling process establishes the relation between optical properties at the leaf level and those at the canopy (tree crown) level. Using 3 D virtualization techniques (ray-tracing), in chapter 4 a model of an existing citrus orchard was constructed and validated using field data. This virtual environment enables simulations of hyperspectral sensor measurements with high accuracy. Innovative aspects are the use of calibrated 3 D tree models with an explicit description of the geometry of all leaves, twigs and stems and realistic simulation of both diffuse and direct sunlight. This virtual environment has subsequently been used as a reference for the (in) validation of different assumptions commonly made by simpler but faster algorithmic canopy reflectance models. Tested assumptions concern the shape, distribution and glossy reflections of leaves, the properties of the incident light and the row structure of orchards. This relation between leaf and tree has not only been studied using simulations, but has also been investigated using a hyperspectral time series of field measurements in a commercial citrus orchard (chapter 5). Changes in leaf, fruit and crown spectra throughout consecutive growth seasons could be explainedby interpreting within-canopy mixtures of canopy components (leaf and fruit types) in different phenological stages (flowering, fruit set and growth and leaf drop), stress (sunburn) and management actions (pruning, irrigation and harvest). The last step in the up-scaling process, from crown to satellite level, was made in chapter 7 in which the impact of shadow, viewing geometry and pixel size were investigated. The second objective in this research was the search for more robust data extraction methods that follow the inverse path: from satellite measurements to biophysical model variables. Chapter 3 introduces an improved model inversion strategy for DLM that allows leaf biochemistry (chlorophyll, carotenoids, dry matter and water) to be determined with higher accuracy. Additional statistical model building (chapter 2) reveals that spectral contact measurements can be used to determine leaf starch and soluble sugar concentrations. For measurements at the crown level, in chapter 6, a new measurement protocol is developed that enables time series collection under variable environmental conditions. This substantially improves measurement opportunities as compared to existing field protocols that demand a cloud free sky. Finally, using the virtualization techniques from chapter 4, chapter 7 finds optimal viewing angles for off-nadir satellite imagery in <b>row</b> <b>plantations</b> that minimize the interfering influence of soil and weeds on the canopy spectrum. The simulations at the different scale levels of this research (biophysical process, leaf, crown and satellite) are some of the building blocks of a framework. Within this framework, remote sensing measurements capable of monitoring the production process of fruit crops can be simulated in a reliable and physically/physiologically based way. The insights that such an approach has delivered were used to make existing data extraction methods more robust and more accurate. Some parts of this research resulted in technologies that can be employed in an operational context, such as a fast assessment of leaf biochemistry and field protocols for canopy reflectance spectra. The full bottom-up approach as envisaged here, however, requires a substantial amount of sustained fundamental and applied research.

Nutsedge and bermudagrass control was 81 and 82 %, respectively, and was more effective than conventional chemical (in the row) + mechanical (between rows) control. Glyphosate at 2 % for nutsedge and 1 % for bermudagrass control, applied twice (October and December), was insufficient to control either perennial weed adequately. Total broadleaved and grass/sedge weed control was 67. 3 and 43. 0 % more effective with the rye mulch than with conventional treatments at Los Andes and Santiago, respectively. Perennial weed control levels could be explained as the new foliage of yellow nutsedge and bermudagrass was particularly susceptible to the shading provided by the rye mulch assembled prior to mid spring shoot emergence, and this effect remained active up {{until the beginning of}} autumn. The subsequent rye foliage mowing at the vegetative stage fully expressed the allelopathic effect produced by this local rye cultivar. The use of rye cover crop management and mulch could be applied as an effective weed control technique in conventional, as well as organic deciduous tree orchards.

Las siegas sucesivas del centeno formaron un mulch vegetal denso y duradero sobre las hileras de vides. El mulch orgánico fue un 81 y 82 % más efectivo para controlar chufa y pasto bermuda, respectivamente, que el control químico (sobre la hilera) + mecánico (entre las hileras). Dos aplicaciones de glifosato (octubre/diciembre) al 2 % para chufa y 1 % para pasto bermuda no fueron suficientes para controlar efectivamente las dos malezas. El grado de control del total de malezas fue 67, 3 y 43, 0 % más efectivo con el mulch vegetal que con los tratamientos químicos en Los Andes y Santiago, respectivamente. El alto control ejercido por el mulch de centeno se debió a que el crecimiento de los nuevos brotes de chufa y pasto bermuda fueron particularmente susceptibles al sombreamiento del mulch, formado antes de su emergencia primaveral y que permaneció hasta inicios del otoño, y a que la siega del centeno maximizó los efectos alelopáticos de esta variedad local de centeno.

The response of single individuals to landscape change can translate into effects at the level of populations; coexisting species can reciprocally influence their responses through the alteration of interspecific relationships; inter-population dynamics can also occur, involving the movement of individuals between populations in different habitat fragments and affecting the persistence of entire systems of populations. Given the complexity of factors involved, including direct and interacting responses, it is extremely difficult to understand the actual effects triggered by habitat fragmentation without a thorough knowledge of the underlying ecological mechanisms. The aim of this PhD project was to contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying the response of species to habitat fragmentation. By following a holistic approach, I used a set of mechanistic field studies on four rodent species specifically designed to investigate the series of key events involved in the persistence of species in fragmented landscapes: 1) Population and individual scale responses of small mammals to patch size, isolation and quality. The aim of this section was to determine the relative effects of landscape structure (habitat amount and configuration) and patch quality (here measured as abundance of shrub resources) on individuals (survival and litter size) and populations (density and colonization/extinction dynamics). A large-scale demographic field study was conducted, encompassing 30 woodland sites nested within three landscapes and surveyed monthly for three years by means of a capture-mark-recapture protocol. Model species was an arboreal rodent, the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius), known to be sensitive to habitat loss and fragmentation. Habitat quality influenced populations at different biological scales by concatenated effects: it enhanced individual survival, increased the chances of colonizing vacant patches and sustained higher population densities. It was therefore related to the performance of single populations and systems of populations through re-colonization dynamics. Habitat quality, however, did not influence local extinction probability, which was ultimately related to the extent of available habitat, likely due to the absolute size of populations: a high absolute number of individuals reduces the chances of population extinction. 2) The role of interspecific interactions in shaping small mammal communities in fragmented landscapes. The aim of this section was to evaluate the strength of interspecific interactions as a shaping force of animal communities in fragmented landscapes. A large-scale demographic field study was conducted to measure the degree of competitive interference between species. Model system was constituted by the community of forest-dwelling ground rodents of central Italy, including the species Apodemus sylvaticus, Apodemus flavicollis and Myodes glareolus. Populations, inhabiting 29 wood patches in a fragmented landscape, were surveyed for two years by means of a capture-mark-recapture protocol. I modeled species' distribution as a function of landscape (habitat cover and connectivity provided by hedgerows) and habitat variables (vegetation structure and food resources) to look for evidences of competitive spatial segregation. Then I tested for each species the effect of competitors on several biological parameters: survival, recruitment, reproduction, body mass, population density. Even though populations' relative distribution was consistent with a mechanism of competitive spatial segregation, with habitat specialists being favored by high-quality, well-connected fragments and generalists exploiting more isolated and degraded patches, results on demographic parameters did not fully confirm this result. The strongest competitive effects were exerted by A. sylvaticus on A. flavicollis, whereas a little degree of interference was found between Apodemus spp. and M. glareolus. Nevertheless, competitive effects were weak, acting on a few biological parameters and not translating into strong effects at the level of populations (density of individuals). These results suggest that populations were mainly distributed according to their ecological requirements; competitive exclusion of specialists from isolated and degraded fragments was actually acting but was likely to play a minor role in determining the observed pattern of distribution. 3) Perceptual range and movement ability of small mammals in fragmented landscapes. The aim of this section was to broaden our understanding of animal orientation and movements in the agricultural matrix, with a special attention on the use of <b>plantation</b> <b>rows</b> as navigation cues. Experiments consisted in releasing individuals of forest-dwelling small mammals (species A. flavicollis, A. sylvaticus, M. glareolus) in fields characterized by different types of matrices: a bare field, a grass field with random pattern of vegetation, and a wheat field at three different stages of growth. Animals (N= 119) were marked with fluorescent powder and released at progressive distances from target wood fragments; in this type of experiments individuals are assumed to go directly toward the wood as soon as they perceive it. Animal tracks were then analyzed to determine perceptual ranges and movement abilities. Perceptual ranges were species-specific, with habitat specialists perceiving woods at smaller distances compared to generalists. The presence of vegetation in the fields (either grass or wheat) strongly reduced perceptual ranges of all species by obstructing individuals' view. Furthermore, wheat <b>plantation</b> <b>rows</b> drastically influenced animal movements, possibly facilitating or hampering the reaching of a wood. Individuals of all species, in fact, followed the direction of wheat rows at any stage of growth, even if they were not directed toward the target wood. This study {{is one of the few}} examples investigating in detail the demographic mechanisms of response of species to habitat fragmentation. The holistic approach allowed me to provide an overview on the process by which factors such as landscape features, habitat characteristics, and co-occurring species affect the performance of populations in fragmented landscapes. Interspecific interactions play a minor role in shaping the community of small mammals in the studied system. A major role, instead, is played by landscape characteristics (such as habitat cover, connectivity, matrix properties) and local features (such as food resources and habitat structure), in both cases depending on species-specific life-history traits. Increased individual performance (e. g. due to habitat quality) can help to increase the viability of systems of populations; at the same time animals are constrained by the physical structure of the landscape where they live, and individual-scale effects are not necessarily transferred to the level of population. Results suggest that in order to increase the viability of animal systems in fragmented landscapes there is the need to manage the quality of habitat, which proves to be a major determinant of animal populations' performance. Nevertheless, findings also strongly suggest not to ignore the overall landscape context where populations are embedded. In landscapes that have been extensively cleared, restoration aimed to increase the amount of habitat and management of outside-patch landscape elements (hedgerows, agricultural fields) might also be a critical step to ensure the persistence of animal communities...|$|R

Este trabalho, desenvolvido na região litorânea do Espírito Santo, teve por objetivo determinar a variação de características químicas do solo em diferentes distâncias do tronco de eucalipto de povoamentos com 31, 54 e 84 meses de idade. Amostras de solo foram coletadas ao redor do tronco da árvore de DAP (diâmetro a 1, 30 m de altura) médio e nas distâncias de 30, 60, 90, 120 e 150 cm, na direção da linha de plantio e da entrelinha, nas camadas de 0 - 10, 10 - 20 e 20 - 40 cm de profundidade, em cada parcela, num total de seis por povoamento. Nessas amostras foram analisados: pH em água (1 : 2, 5), P e K disponíveis (Mehlich- 1), Al, Ca e Mg trocáveis (KCl 1 mol L- 1). Os resultados indicaram variações nas características químicas do solo com a distância do tronco de eucalipto. Os teores de P, K, Ca 2 + e Al 3 + diminuíram com a distância desse tronco nas três idades avaliadas, e os valores de pH aumentam com a distância do eucalipto aos 31 e 84 meses, assim como os teores de Mg 2 + em relação ao eucalipto com 31 meses, na direção da linha e da entrelinha. As características químicas do solo obtidas na linha e entrelinha do eucalipto aos 84 meses foram mais semelhantes, exceto Ca 2 +. Maiores valores de pH, P, K, Ca 2 + e Mg 2 + ocorreram na camada superficial. The {{knowledge}} of spatial variations in fields with eucalyptus plantations {{is important for}} the establishment of criteria of soil sampling and fertilizer recommendation. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the soil chemical variations affected by the distance from eucalyptus trunks along and between the planting <b>rows</b> in eucalypt <b>plantations</b> at different ages (31, 54, and 84 months), in the Eastern Coastal Region of Brazil. Soil samples were collected around trees whose diameter at breast height corresponded to the average of the population, and at distances of 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 cm from the trunk along and between planting rows. The samples were collected at the depths of 0 - 10, 10 - 20, and 20 - 40 cm and analyzed for pH in water (1 : 2, 5), P and K (Mehlich- 1), Ca, Mg, and Al (KCl 1 mol L- 1). Results indicated variations of soil chemical properties according to the distances of trunks of eucalyptus. The concentrations of P, K, Ca 2 + and Al 3 + decreased with the distance of the trunk of the eucalyptus in the three evaluated ages and the values of pH increased with the distance of the eucalyptus with 31 and 84 months, as well as the concentrations of Mg 2 + for the eucalyptus with 31 months sampled in line and interlines. The chemical attributes of the soil obtained in the line and interline directions with 84 months were similar, except for Ca 2 +. Higher values of pH, P, K, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + were found at the superficial layer of the soil...|$|R
