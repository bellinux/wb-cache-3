5|$|Al-Maʿarri's {{fundamental}} pessimism {{is expressed}} in his anti-natalist <b>recommendation</b> <b>that</b> no children should be begotten, so as to spare them the pains of life. In an elegy composed by him {{over the loss of}} a relative, he combines his grief with observations on the ephemerality of this life: Even on al-Maʿarri's epitaph, he wanted it written that his life was a wrong done by his father and not one that was done by himself.|$|E
5|$|However, the German {{delegation}} {{and others}} rejected the NATO <b>recommendation</b> <b>that</b> 5.7×28mm be standardized, halting the standardization process indefinitely. As a result, both the 4.6×30mm and 5.7×28mm cartridges (and the associated weapons) have been independently adopted by various NATO countries, according to preference; both the P90 and Five-seven {{are currently in}} service with military and police forces in over 40 nations throughout the world.|$|E

He was found guilty of all five murders on 21 February 2008, and was sentenced the following day to life imprisonment, with a <b>recommendation</b> <b>that</b> he should never be released from prison.|$|E
5|$|As of the 2016–17 season, Premier League {{football}} {{has been}} played in 55 stadiums since {{the formation of}} the division in 1992. The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a <b>recommendation</b> <b>that</b> standing terraces should be abolished; as a result all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater. Since {{the formation of the}} Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums. Nine stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished. The stadiums for the 2010–11 season show a large disparity in capacity: Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United has a capacity of 75,957 with Bloomfield Road, the home of Blackpool, having a capacity of 16,220. The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2010–11 season is 770,477 with an average capacity of 38,523.|$|E

5|$|Burnet {{served as}} a member or {{chairman}} of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, {{he was a member}} of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947–52), he was also a member of the Commonwealth government's Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the <b>recommendation</b> <b>that</b> Australia pursue development of chemical and biological weapons to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled War from a Biological Angle. Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.|$|E
5|$|Few crashes {{have been}} {{attributed}} to design flaws of the 747. The Tenerife airport disaster resulted from pilot error and communications failure, while the Japan Airlines Flight 123 and China Airlines Flight 611 crashes stemmed from improper aircraft repair. United Airlines Flight 811, which suffered an explosive decompression mid-flight on February 24, 1989, led the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to issue a <b>recommendation</b> <b>that</b> 747-200 cargo doors similar to those on the Flight 811 aircraft be modified. Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 after it had strayed into Soviet territory, causing U.S. President Ronald Reagan to authorize the then-strictly military global positioning system (GPS) for civilian use.|$|E

Augustine, General Electric Company (GEC) Lord Weinstock, Secretary of State for Defence Michael Portillo, and Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, seeking a 90-day interval to fully revise their bid. In December 1996, it was announced that the $US3.5-billion contract had been awarded to British Aerospace to produce the Nimrod 2000, at which point the aircraft had also received the designation Nimrod MRA4.|$|E
5|$|In later life, Morshead {{turned down}} various offers of {{military}} and diplomatic posts, {{as well as the}} governorship of Queensland. He did serve as president of the Boy Scouts Association of New South Wales and the Big Brother Movement, a British youth emigration support scheme, and was a trustee of the Gowrie scholarship trust fund, which provided assistance to the descendants of Second World War veterans. In 1957 he was appointed chairman of a committee which reviewed the group of departments concerned with defence. The Menzies government accepted the committee's <b>recommendation</b> <b>that</b> Supply and Defence Production be amalgamated, but dropped the key proposal that the Department of Defence absorb the Departments of Army, Navy and Air. This reform was finally carried out by the Whitlam government in 1975.|$|E

That newspaper gave a positive review, describing Soeara Berbisa as a tense film with humorous moments and beautiful scenery.

He {{became interested in}} the people and scenes around him, and recorded them in drawings after Theo's suggestion that he take up art in earnest. He travelled to Brussels later in the year, to follow Theo's <b>recommendation</b> <b>that</b> he study with the Dutch artist Willem Roelofs, who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art – to attend the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts. He registered at the Académie in November 1880, where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of modelling and perspective.|$|E
5|$|A call to {{increase}} the battery life of ULBs was once again made after the unsuccessful initial search in 2009 for the flight recorders on Air France Flight 447, which were not located until 2011. A formal <b>recommendation</b> <b>that</b> the ULB design be upgraded to offer a longer battery life or to make the recorders ejectable had {{been included in the}} final report of the board of inquiry into the loss of South African Airways Flight 295 over the Indian Ocean in 1987; however, the ICAO did not make such a recommendation until 2014, with implementation by 2018. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued new regulations requiring that the transmitting time of ULBs fitted to aircraft flight recorders be increased from 30 to 90 days. The agency proposed a new underwater locator beacon with a greater transmitting range to be fitted to aircraft flying over oceans. In June 2015, Dukane, a manufacturer of underwater locator beacons, began selling beacons with a 90-day battery life.|$|E
5|$|On 28 January, {{classes in}} Madras University, Annamalai University and other colleges and {{schools in the}} state were {{suspended}} indefinitely. Within the Congress, opinion was divided: one group led by K. Kamaraj wanted the government not to impose Hindi on the Tamils; but others like Morarji Desai did not relent. Home minister Nanda agreed with Bhaktavatsalam's handling of the agitation. Rioting continued throughout {{the first week of}} February and by the second week students lost control of the agitation. Violence continued despite Annadurai's appeal for calm. Efforts were made by both sides to find a compromise. On 11 February, C. Subramaniam and O. V. Alagesan, two union ministers from Madras state, resigned protesting the government's language policy. President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan refused to accept the Prime Minister Shastri's <b>recommendation</b> <b>that</b> their resignations be accepted. Shastri backed down and made a broadcast through All India Radio on 11 February. Expressing shock over the riots, he promised to honour Nehru's assurances. He also assured Tamils that English would continue to be used for centre-state and intrastate communications and that the All India Civil Services examination would continue to be conducted in English.|$|E
