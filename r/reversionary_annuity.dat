50|$|Annuitants {{are persons}} {{receiving}} a retirement annuity or disability retirement annuity. Beneficiaries are persons receiving a survivor benefit or <b>reversionary</b> <b>annuity.</b> As of June 30, 2013, there were 108,783 annuitants and beneficiaries.|$|E
50|$|Although {{this will}} reduce the {{available}} payments, an annuity can be arranged to continue until {{the death of the}} last survivor of two or more people. For example, many annuities continue to pay out (perhaps at a reduced rate) to the spouse of the main annuitant after his or her death, {{for as long as the}} spouse survives. The annuity paid to the spouse is called a <b>reversionary</b> <b>annuity</b> or survivorship annuity. However, if the annuitant is in good health, it may be more beneficial to select the higher payout option on their life only and purchase a life insurance policy that would pay income to the survivor.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{dependence}} between coupled lives, i. e., the spouses' dependence, across different generations, {{and its effects}} on prices of <b>reversionary</b> <b>annuities</b> in the presence of longevity risk. Longevity risk is represented via a stochastic mortality intensity. We find that a generation-based model is important, since spouses' dependence decreases when passing from older generations to younger generations. The independence assumption produces quantifiable mispricing of <b>reversionary</b> <b>annuities,</b> with different effects on different generations. The research is conducted using a well-known dataset of double life contracts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{dependence}} between coupled lives - {{both within and}} across generations - {{and its effects on}} prices of <b>reversionary</b> <b>annuities</b> in the presence of longevity risk. Longevity risk is represented via a stochastic mortality intensity. Dependence is modelled through copula functions. We consider Archimedean single and multi-parameter copulas. We and that dependence decreases when passing from older generations to younger generations. Not only the level of dependence but also its features - as measured by the copula - change across generations: the best-fit Archimedean copula is not the same across generations. Moreover, for all the generations under exam the single-parameter copula is dominated by the two-parameter one. The independence assumption produces quantifiable mispricing of <b>reversionary</b> <b>annuities.</b> The misspecification of the copula produces different mispricing effects on different generations. The research is conducted using a well-known dataset of double life contracts...|$|R
40|$|In 1807 {{the first}} life {{insurance}} society {{was established in}} The Netherlands. In {{the second half of}} the century, life insurance societies underwent considerable expansion. During the intervening period, the lines had to be laid along which this new phenomenon was to develop in the future: Between 1827 and 1830, the government started discussing the nature of its responsibility in this field and the kind of policy to be developed, and in 1830, a book on the organization of life insurance societies, the calculation of life annuities and widows’ fund premiums was published, written by the mathematician Rehuel Lobatto. This book played an important role in the government’s discussion. Royal Decrees which prescribed government approval for the establishment of life assurance societies were promulgated in 1830, 1833 and 1840. In 1832, Lobatto became the government’s scientific adviser on the assessment of the calculations performed by these societies, and in the same year, he was also appointed adviser to the first life insurance society. From 1832 until his death in 1866 he advised the company on the use of life tables for life as well as for <b>reversionary</b> <b>annuities,</b> and he calculated the premiums based on these life tables. Another decree was promulgated in 1864 prescribing exactly which life tables were to be used. Because Lobatto probably played a part in this decree, he was responsible for a very ‘conservative’ government policy, which was no longer adequate in {{the second half of the}} century. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
50|$|For an {{additional}} expense (either {{by way of}} an increase in payments (premium) or a decrease in benefits), an annuity or benefit rider can be purchased on another life such as a spouse, family member or friend for the duration of whose life the annuity is wholly or partly guaranteed. For example, it is common to buy an annuity which will continue to pay out to the spouse of the annuitant after death, for so long as the spouse survives. The annuity paid to the spouse is called a <b>reversionary</b> <b>annuity</b> or survivorship annuity. However, if the annuitant is in good health, it may be more advantageous to select the higher payout option on his or her life only and purchase a life insurance policy that would pay income to the survivor.|$|E
