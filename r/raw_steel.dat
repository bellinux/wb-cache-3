500|$|When iron is smelted {{from its}} ore, it {{contains}} more carbon than is desirable. [...] To become steel, {{it must be}} reprocessed to reduce the carbon to the correct amount, at which point other elements can be added. [...] In the past, steel facilities would cast the <b>raw</b> <b>steel</b> product into ingots which would be stored until use in further refinement processes {{that resulted in the}} finished product. In modern facilities, the initial product is close to the final composition and is continuously cast into long slabs, cut and shaped into bars and extrusions and heat treated to produce a final product. Today only a small fraction is cast into ingots. [...] Approximately 96% of steel is continuously cast, while only 4% is produced as ingots.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fluctuations in raw {{material}} and product prices have caused manufacturers and consumers to experience serious losses in steel sector {{as well as}} in all other sectors. As the number of manufacturers of commodities like coking coal, iron ore and scrap- the main <b>raw</b> materials of <b>steel</b> manufacturing- is less worldwide and their manufacturers do not want to disclose price in an organized market, their future transaction volumes have not developed sufficiently yet. However, future transaction volumes of non-ferrous metals like aluminum, tin etc. that are used as auxiliary <b>raw</b> materials in <b>steel</b> manufacturing have increased fast in organized markets and such style of future transactions have become important in steel manufacturing in terms of cost management. The London Metal Exchange, one of the leading future commodity markets of world, has an important place in management of price risk in steel manufacturing and consumption of derivative transaction contracts. In this study, causality relationship between the price series of non-ferrous metals used as <b>raw</b> materials in <b>steel</b> manufacturing is examined by using Toda and Yamamoto (1995) causality test procedure. Empirical results suggest that aluminum is Granger cause of the other non-ferrous metals...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{aimed at}} {{determination}} of increased carbon content influence on segregation processes in a duplex ferritic-austenitic cast steel. The analysis of <b>raw</b> cast <b>steel</b> structure {{was carried out}} using a Zeiss Axiovert 25 optical microscope. The chemical composition of selected areas was examined using a JEOL JSM 5400 scanning microscope equipped with an EDX microanalyser and the obtained results were verified using the Thermo-Calc software. The investigations carried out {{have shown that the}} lower carbon content causes the smaller amount of the intermetallic phases precipitates undesirable in the manufacturing process, which – affecting a clear deterioration in <b>raw</b> cast <b>steel</b> impact strength – promote origination of cracks in the castings. The increased, due to segregation processes, content of carbon, chromium and molybdenum within the solidification grain boundaries promotes precipitation of carbides already in the liquid state, what increases the propensity for hot cracking. The molybdenum content, in a cast steel of increased carbon content, varies from ~ 4 % in the centre of solidification grain to ~ 6. 5 % in its boundary areas, and the chromium content from ~ 28 % to 32 %, respectively. Small enrichment of ferrite with molybdenum and chromium in boundary areas of cast steel solidification grains containing 0. 02 % carbon causes higher ferrite stability and prevents its decomposition in the temperature range from 600 to 900 °C, what makes that the cast steel of lower carbon content features uniform ferritic-austenitic structure in as cast state...|$|R
