30|$|The {{regulatory}} framework defines the cost at which electricity can be offered by prosumers for {{trading on the}} LEM. It is highest when using the public grid, as the entirety of regulated German tariff components has to be paid {{in addition to an}} opportunity cost from a lost feed-in tariff. Prosumers in Germany are currently guaranteed a specific feed-in tariff cF for RES feed-in into the public grid. Thus, this opportunity cost with the addition of taxes, fees and levies stipulates the lower cost bound for selling RES generation on the LEM. In a physical microgrid certain regulated tariff components do not apply. This decreases the possible offer price and opens up a trading window as compared to the national <b>reference</b> <b>tariff</b> of the public grid. With the third case of a favorable {{regulatory framework}} for LEM trading, we study the impact of omitting the renewable surcharge in a LEM. A detailed overview {{of the impact of the}} regulatory framework on possible bid prices is given by Table  1. In a public grid, trading on the LEM would only be possible above the <b>reference</b> <b>tariff.</b> As we only consider LEM trading between the feed-in tariff plus regulated tariff components and the <b>reference</b> <b>tariff,</b> trading will not be economic and is thus not applied in our simulation. However, both the microgrid and favorable regulation scenario offer a trading window between the considered lower and upper LEM price bounds.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, {{the idea}} of a LEM with the {{established}} <b>reference</b> <b>tariff</b> as back-up option is a representation of pilot and test cases of LEMs. The sustainable implementation of LEMs as an addition or alternative to the existing German energy market will require a revision of the socialization of grid fees, and an establishment of inter-LEM trading and energy transmission. Additionally, the role of energy storage in LEMs and DR needs to be extensively integrated in further research. Energy storage may offer significant benefits for the level of self-sufficiency and grid-supportive operation.|$|E

Interestingly, the estimated reference price is still lower than the electricity tariffs for households in most EU countries. In particular, the reference price of 615.7 UAH/MWh equals 0.064 EUR/kWh. In comparison, the lowest electricity tariff for households (at annual consumption 3500 kWh) was in Latvia, 0.068 EUR/kWh, and the highest in Italy, 0.268 EUR/kWh as of July, 2010 (Europe’s Energy Portal [2010]).|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In wind energy, an {{incentive}} payment {{related to the}} reactive power compensation is applied. In the past, the maximum incentive was achieved when the cos φ, that was calculated as a monthly mean, was almost unitary (cos φ = 1. 00). The payment is {{a percentage of the}} average <b>reference</b> <b>tariff</b> (ART). Since the 1 st of January 2007, the Spanish regulation RD 436 / 2004 has modified the incentive payment. Nowadays, it is calculated each 15 minutes from the energy during this period, and its maximum value depends on the achievement of a objective power factor (cos φ) which is defined in three time frames: peak hours (cos φ < 0, 95 cap.), valley hours (cos φ < 0. 95 ind.) and flat hours (cos φ = 1. 00). To maximize the incentive payment, in the Sotavento Experimental Wind Park (Spain) a configuration with a central controller that coordinates the actuation over all the capacitor steps in the wind park has been installed. In this article, a central controller algorithm which is based on a dynamic programming is proposed. Its main objectives are: to maximize the incentive payment, or achieve the equivalent objective PF, and to minimize the number of connection operations over the capacitor steps (especially those in substation). At the present time, the algorithm is being tested in the wind park. Keywords-component; Wind park, power factor correction, dynamic programming I...|$|E
30|$|Retail {{gas prices}} for {{households}} and district heating companies constitute only 26  % and 57  % of the reference price, respectively. In comparison, current prices for industry and state-funded institutions are equal to 81  % of the <b>reference</b> price because <b>tariffs</b> for these consumer groups {{are based on}} the import gas price. It {{is important to note that}} the estimate is highly sensitive to the import border price. The price of Russian gas for Ukraine is indexed to prices of oil products at the global market and also depends on the political situation between two countries. Hence, it is likely that the gas price will continue to grow in the future and domestic gas tariffs should be increased in line with import gas prices to prevent price distortions in the domestic market.|$|R
40|$|To {{model the}} {{resource}} implications of placental growth factor (PlGF) testing {{in women with}} suspected pre-eclampsia prior to 35 weeks' gestation {{as part of a}} management algorithm, compared with current practice. Data on resource use from 132 women with suspected pre-eclampsia prior to 35 weeks' gestation, enrolled in a prospective observational cohort study evaluating PlGF measurement within antenatal assessment units within two UK consultant-led maternity units was extracted by case note review. A decision analytic model was developed using these data to establish the budget impact of managing women with suspected pre-eclampsia for two weeks from the date of PlGF testing, using a clinical management algorithm and <b>reference</b> cost <b>tariffs.</b> The main outcome measures of resource use (numbers of outpatient appointments, ultrasound investigations and hospital admissions) were correlated to final diagnosis and used to calculate comparative management regimes. The mean cost saving associated with the PlGF test (in the PlGF plus management arm) was £ 35, 087 (95 % CI -£ 33, 181 to -£ 36, 992) per 1, 000 women. This equated to a saving of £ 582 (95 % CI - 552 to -£ 613) per woman tested. In 94 % of iterations, PlGF testing was associated with cost saving compared to current practice. This analysis suggests PlGF used as part of a clinical management algorithm in women presenting with suspected pre-eclampsia prior to 35 weeks' gestation could provide cost savings by reducing unnecessary resource use. Introduction of PlGF testing could be used to direct appropriate resource allocation and overall would be cost saving...|$|R
40|$|The books noticed here, at {{different}} levels of communication, all attempt to state conditions of our material and social welfare. Mr. Hazlitt 2 ̆ 7 s message is pitched for anyone literate enough to absorb the Reader 2 ̆ 7 s Digest, where it has already received the accolade of condensation. The six distinguished economists who contribute to Financing American Prosperity address college seniors, with a wary eye on each other. Mr. Peter Drucker, who denies being an economist at all (he {{is a member of the}} department of Political Economy at Bennington College), takes a 2 ̆ 2 social and political approach to the problems of an industrial society—as distinct from economics. 2 ̆ 2 His language is simple; his ideas are not. The one lesson of Economics in One Lesson, the author says, 2 ̆ 2 can be reduced to a single sentence. The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups. 2 ̆ 2 So far, so good. Mr. Hazlitt teaches his Lesson by exposing again the most glaring fallacies of those who have strayed from the principles of classical economics, to which he is a proud and confessed adherent. He uses these principles effectively for lucid analyses of such persistent though hoary heresies as protective tariffs, one-way foreign trade, spread-the-work schemes, parity prices, silver purchases and other subsidies to sick industries, and the cruder forms of purchasing-power theory—effectively, that is, within his basic assumptions, which again are those of the mid-nineteenth century. In his other capacities as publicist and literary critic, the author may not subscribe to the sway of Economic Man in human affairs, but in the brief pages of One Lesson he rules unmitigated. Thus to the author, as to his predecessors, 2 ̆ 2 a mere recital of the economic policies of governments all over the world is calculated to cause any serious student of economics to throw up his hands in despair 2 ̆ 2 —this with <b>reference</b> to protective <b>tariffs.</b> That protectionism may have its roots, not in a misunderstanding, but in a profound rejection of the anarchy of laissez-faire, a thesis brilliantly developed by Karl Polanyi in The Great Transformation, is beyond the scope of One Lesson...|$|R
40|$|The South African Revenue Service {{has since}} 2009 {{introduced}} “reference pricing” {{as a tool}} to detect undervaluation of customs values of imported clothing and textiles. The term “reference pricing” is not defined in the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 which is the legislation that governs the importation of goods into the Republic of South Africa. The mandate of the South African Revenue Service, amongst others, is to facilitate legitimate trade. By applying the reference pricing guidelines the South African Revenue Service will target all importers who declare customs values which are less than the reference price for a targeted tariff heading associated with an item of clothing or textile. The Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 is clear in that the transaction value which is the price paid or payable for the imported goods shall be the value used for customs duty purposes. The Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 also requires that the interpretation of the sections 65, 66 and 67 of the said Act shall be subject to the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Valuation Agreement). Part I of the Valuation Agreement deals with the rules for customs valuation. Article 17 of part 1 allows for customs administrations to satisfy themselves as to the truth or accuracy of any statement, document or declaration presented for customs valuation purposes. The Technical Committee on Customs Valuation of the World Trade Organisation decided the following in so far as Article 17 of the aforesaid agreement is concerned: “ 1. When a declaration has been presented and where the customs administration has reason to doubt the truth or accuracy of the particulars or of documents produced in support of this declaration, the customs administration may ask the importer to provide further explanation, including documents or other evidence, that the declared value represents the total amount actually paid or payable for the imported goods, [...] ” It would appear that the South African Revenue Service is using reference prices {{as a tool to}} support its reason for doubting the truth or accuracy of the declared customs values. The indiscriminate use of reference pricing, it is submitted, affects legitimate trade adversely. This treatise provides an understanding of how the customs value should be determined in terms of the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 and the Valuation Agreement. It then provides a background to reference pricing and how reference pricing will be used to detect undervalued imports of clothing and textiles, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using reference pricing and a comparative analysis of the approach adopted by the Mexican Tax Administration Service in so far as the use of reference pricing is concerned. It was established that the reference price cannot replace the customs value of an imported clothing item as the customs value is based on the price actually paid or payable for it and not on some arbitrary or fictitious value. The reference price can only be used as a tool to identify importers that are possibly undervaluing the customs values. The disadvantages far outweigh the advantages of using reference pricing. The treatise further provides a background to the use of a valuation database as a risk assessment tool and compares this to the use of reference pricing. The use of reference pricing and its impact on trade facilitation is then discussed as well as whether the use of reference pricing is consistent with the risk management principles as discussed in the World Customs Organisation Risk Management Guide. It was established that the South African Revenue Service has not disclosed the basis of arriving at the <b>reference</b> price per <b>tariff</b> heading that it targets and the use of reference pricing is not sanctioned by any international guideline or agreement. It was also established that the use of reference pricing targets compliant importers unnecessarily and this practice goes against the principles of trade facilitation. The use of reference pricing can be used as a tool to detect undervalued imports of clothing but should not be used as a basis to stop every consignment of clothing simply because the customs value declared is less than the reference price. It should not be used as a stand-alone tool but rather enhanced further with the recommendations provided. In the final analysis, recommendations are provided which seek to enhance the reference pricing mechanism and to further identify and exclude compliant importers and limit the use of reference pricing to target non-compliant importers who undervalue the customs value of imported clothing and textile items...|$|R
