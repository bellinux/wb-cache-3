25|$|Research on priming and {{practice}} use single word tests to assess {{for the presence}} of TOT states. The first letter of the target word or a similar-sounding word is given in order to prime for the target word. Evidence that comes from the usefulness of priming {{and practice}} in reducing TOT states is that most information in TOT states is low-frequency; that is, it has not been used or recalled for some time. The recency of information use can influence the <b>retrieval</b> <b>process</b> of that information. The presentation of a prime is only needed once for it to facilitate TOT state resolution. Support for priming has been found in that when individuals are given the first letter of the word they are trying to recall, {{they are more likely to}} overcome their TOT state. When the prime is a related word instead of the first letter, an interesting effect occurs: When the prime word has similar phonology to the target word, an increase in the frequency of TOT states and a higher frequency of correctly recalled words when the TOT state is resolved is observed. Incorrect words come to mind involuntarily that share similar phonological features with the target word. Thus, phonological similarity can both decrease and increase TOT states. However, it is possible to fix this problem by changing the syntactic class of the priming word. Priming words that are in the same syntactic class as the target word create no difference in TOT state resolution. The TOT state resolution was the same for priming words in the same syntactic class and unrelated priming words. If the priming word is being listed in conjunction with other unrelated priming words, then the position is of importance. The earlier in the list the priming word is, the less likely it is to help resolve the TOT state.|$|E
2500|$|A {{standard}} model of memory that employs association {{in this manner}} is the Search of Associative Memory (SAM) model. Though SAM was originally designed to model episodic memory, its mechanisms are sufficient to support some semantic memory representations, as well. The SAM model contains a short- term store (STS) and long term store (LTS), where STS is a briefly activated subset of {{the information in the}} LTS. [...] The STS has limited capacity and affects the <b>retrieval</b> <b>process</b> by limiting the amount of information that can be sampled and limiting the time the sampled subset is in an active mode. [...] The <b>retrieval</b> <b>process</b> in LTS is cue dependent and probabilistic, meaning that a cue initiates the <b>retrieval</b> <b>process</b> and the selected information from memory is random. [...] The probability of being sampled is dependent on the strength of association between the cue and the item being retrieved, with stronger associations being sampled and finally one is chosen. [...] The buffer size is defined as r, and not a fixed number, and as items are rehearsed in the buffer the associative strengths grow linearly {{as a function of the}} total time inside the buffer. In SAM, when any two items simultaneously occupy a working memory buffer, the strength of their association is incremented. Thus, items that co-occur more often are more strongly associated. Items in SAM are also associated with a specific context, where the strength of that association determined by how long each item is present in a given context. In SAM, then, memories consist of a set of associations between items in memory and between items and contexts. The presence of a set of items and/or a context is more likely to evoke, then, some subset of the items in memory. The degree to which items evoke one another—either by virtue of their shared context or their co-occurrence—is an indication of the items' semantic relatedness.|$|E

Spontaneous re-trieval was inferred from slowed lexical decision responses to target cues (i. e., intention interference). When the intention was finished, younger adults efficiently deacti-vated their intention, but the older adults continued to retrieve their intentions. Levels of inhibitory functioning were negatively associated with intention interference in the older adult group, {{but not in the}} younger adult group. These results indicate that normal aging might not compromise spontaneous <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes</b> but that the ability to deactivate completed intentions is impaired...|$|R
50|$|Naturally, Roediger's {{approach}} to explaining this phenomenon was through <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes.</b> He thought that perhaps recalling list items {{would increase the}} availability of the lure word to a level where it became so available that it was mistaken for a presented word. However, <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes</b> alone were not enough to explain the findings - in a number of studies Roediger and his colleagues showed that a warning about developing a false memory had no effect if it was presented before retrieval, but could reduce false memories if presented before the encoding phase, suggesting an important role being played by the encoding process. Further work led Roediger and his research team to acknowledge both encoding and <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes</b> in explaining this phenomenon.|$|R

Ocean mining sites are usually around large areas of polymetallic nodules or active and extinct hydrothermal vents at about 1,400 – 3,700 meters below the ocean's surface. The vents create sulfide deposits, which contain precious metals such as silver, gold, copper, manganese, cobalt, and zinc.

2500|$|The {{two-stage}} theory {{states that}} the process of recall begins with a search and <b>retrieval</b> <b>process,</b> and then a decision or recognition process where the correct information is chosen from what has been retrieved. [...] In this theory, recognition only involves the latter of these two stages, or processes, and this is thought to account for the superiority of the recognition process over recall. [...] Recognition only involves one process in which error or failure may occur, while recall involves two. [...] However, recall {{has been found to be}} superior to recognition in some cases, such as a failure to recognize words that can later be recalled.|$|E
2500|$|Bilingual lexical {{access is}} an area in {{psycholinguistics}} research that studies the activation or <b>retrieval</b> <b>process</b> of the mental lexicon for people who can speak two languages. Bilingual lexical access {{can be understood as}} all aspects of word processing, including all the mental activity from the perception of the word from one language until all its lexical knowledge from the target language is available. Research in this field seeks to fully understand these mental processes. Bilingual individuals have two mental lexical representations for an item or concept and are able to successfully select words from one language without significant interference from the other language. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} whether these dual representations interact or affect one another. Bilingual lexical access researchers focus on the control mechanisms bilinguals use to suppress the language not in use when in a monolingual mode and the degree to which the related representations within the language not in use are activated. [...] For example, when a Dutch-English bilingual is asked to name a picture of a dog in English, he or she will come up with the English word dog. Bilingual lexical access is the mental process that underlies this seemingly simple task: the process that makes the connection between the [...] "idea" [...] dog and the word dog in the target language. While activating the English word dog, the Dutch word hond (its equivalent in Dutch), is most likely also in a state of activation.|$|E

This decrease in remember responses is associated with poor encoding and frontal lobe dysfunction. It has been found that older individuals fail to use elaborative encoding in comparison to younger individuals. In addition to poor encoding, older individuals tend to have problems with retrieving information that is highly specific because they are less effective at controlling their <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes.</b> It is difficult for older individuals to constrain <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes</b> to the context of the specific item that is to be retrieved.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that sentence processing is mediated by content-addressable direct <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes</b> (McElree, 2000; McElree, Foraker, & Dyer, 2003). However, the memory <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes</b> may differ {{as a function of the}} type of dependency. For example, while many studies have reported facilitatory intrusion effects associated with a structurally illicit antecedent during the processing of subject-verb number or person agreement and negative polarity items (Dillon, Mishler, Sloggett, & Phillips, 2013; Pearlmutter, Garnsey & Bock, 1999; Xiang, Dillon, & Phillips, 2009), studies investigating reflexives have not found consistent evidence of intrusion effects (Parker & Lago, & Phillips, 2015; Sturt & Kwon, 2015; cf. Nicol & Swinney, 1989; Sturt, 2003). Similarly, the memory <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes</b> could be also sensitive to cross-linguistic differences (cf. Lago, Shalom, Sigman, Lau & Phillips, 2015). We report one self-paced reading experiment and one eye-tracking experiment that examine the processing of subject-verb honorific agreement, a dependency that is different from those that have been studied to date, in Korean, a typologically different language from those previously studied. The overall results suggest that the <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes</b> underlying the processing of subject-verb honorific agreement in Korean are susceptible to facilitatory intrusion effects from a structurally illicit but feature-matching subject, with a pattern that is similar to subject-verb agreement in English. In addition, the attraction effect was not limited to the ungrammatical sentences but was also found in grammatical sentences. The clear attraction effect in the grammatical sentences suggest that the attraction effect does not solely arise as the result of an error-driven process (cf. Wagers, Lau & Phillips, 2009), but is likely also to result from general mechanisms of <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes</b> of activating of potential items in memory (Vasishth, Brüssow, Lewis, & Drenhaus, 2008) ...|$|R
2500|$|Age is an {{important}} factor when considering TOT states. There are complaints that problems recalling information increases with age. The frequency of TOTs increases in adulthood and even more so during the elderly years. Compared with young adults, older adults generally report having more TOT states, fewer alternate words, and less phonological information about the target word. The underpinnings of TOT with regard to age have focused on neurological brain differences. Current research uses neuroimaging methods to access the presence of different brain patterns when a younger and older individual is experiencing a TOT state. It is found that older and younger individuals employ a similar network of brain regions during TOT states such as the prefrontal cortex, left insula, and sensorimotor cortex. However, older individuals show differences in activity in some areas compared to younger individuals. TOTs increase with age-related gray matter loss in the left insula for older individuals. [...] This is accompanied by less activity in the left insula and is related to higher frequency of TOTs. Furthermore, it was found that older individuals have over-activation in their prefrontal cortex when experiencing TOT states. This may indicate a continued search when the <b>retrieval</b> <b>process</b> fails and a TOT state is experienced. More specifically, greater activation in the sensorimotor cortex in older individuals and less in younger adults may reflect differences in the knowledge that is used to retrieve the target information. Priming words during word retrieval tests generally reduces the frequency of TOTs and improves the retrieval of the target word and has been shown to have a larger benefit for older adults. This is consistent with the spreading activation model, where neural connections are strengthened when used more. [...] Although older people experience more tip of the tongue states more often than any other category, [...] recent studies have shown that frequent tip of the tongue states are not linked at all to dementia, which is common in the elderly. Despite the association of increased age with lower levels of episodic memory and more frequent TOT states, the two phenomena seem to be largely independent of one another.|$|E

Previous studies suggest dissociable regions in the left lateral parietal cortex {{that are associated with}} the <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes.</b> Moreover, studies using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) have provided evidence for the temporo-parietal memory networks that may support the <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes.</b> In this functional MRI study, we tested functional significance of the memory networks by examining functional connectivity of brain activity during episodic retrieval in the temporal and parietal regions of the memory networks. Recency judgments, judgments of the temporal order of past events, can be achieved by at least two <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes,</b> relational and item-based. Neuroimaging results revealed several temporal and parietal activations associated with relational/item-based recency judgments. Significant RSFC was observed between one parahippocampal region and one left lateral parietal region associated with relational recency judgments, and between four lateral temporal regions and another left lateral parietal region associated with item-based recency judgments. Functional connectivity during task was found to be significant between the parahippocampal region and the parietal region in the RSFC network associated with relational recency judgments. However, out of the four tempo-parietal RSFC networks associated with item-based recency judgments, only one of them (between the left posterior lateral temporal region and the left lateral parietal region) showed significant functional connectivity during task. These results highlight the contrasting roles of the parahippocampal and the lateral temporal regions in recency judgments, and suggest that only a part of the tempo-parietal RSFC networks are recruited to support particular <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

For decades, researchers studied prospective memory outside of the laboratory by having participants phone an experimenter on a certain date or remember to mail a postcard to the experimenter. McDaniel, along with his colleague Gil Einstein, are credited with developing one of the earliest, and since then the most frequently used, laboratory measure of prospective memory. In addition to developing the standard laboratory measure of prospective memory, McDaniel has made several contributions {{to the understanding of}} the processes underlying successful prospective memory retrieval. His Multiprocess Framework contends that individuals can consciously maintain prospective memory intentions and monitor for retrieval cues, or they may rely on cue-driven spontaneous <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes.</b> The efficacy of monitoring and spontaneous <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes</b> is assumed to depend on the quality of encoding, the quality of the retrieval cue, and the overlap between encoding and retrieval conditions (termed cue focality). McDaniel has further distinguished the neural bases of these <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes</b> by using functional magnetic resonance imaging to illustrate that monitoring is supported by sustained anterior prefrontal cortex activation, whereas spontaneous retrieval is not. An important prediction of McDaniel's Multiprocess Framework is that aging impacts prefrontal-cortex-dependent monitoring processes, but not spontaneous <b>retrieval</b> <b>processes</b> that are assumed to be more automatic. The nature of age-related changes in prospective memory continues to be debated by the field, but research findings are consistent in showing that monitoring declines with aging and spontaneous retrieval appears to remain relatively intact in older adults.
