First of all, according to characteristics of the artificial fireflies swarm algorithm and the complex method, it incorporates the ideas of complex method into the artificial firefly algorithm, uses the complex method to guide the search of artificial fireflies in population, and then introduces local search operator in the firefly mobile mechanism, {{in order to improve}} the searching efficiency and convergence precision of algorithm. Simulation results show that, the cloud computing <b>resources</b> <b>security</b> distribution model based on improved artificial firefly algorithm proposed in this paper has good convergence effect and optimum efficiency...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a fuzzy multi-attribute {{decision}} analysis approach (FMADAA) {{was developed for}} supporting the evaluation of water <b>resources</b> <b>security</b> in nine provinces within the Yellow River basin. A numerical approximation system and a modified left–right scoring approach were adopted {{to cope with the}} uncertainties in the acquired information. Also, four conventional multi-attribute {{decision analysis}} (MADA) methods were implemented in the evaluation model for impact evaluation, including simple weighted addition (SWA), weighted product (WP), cooperative game theory (CGT) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). Moreover, several aggregation methods including average ranking procedure, Borda and Copeland methods were used to integrate the ranking results, helping rank the water <b>resources</b> <b>security</b> in those nine provinces as well as improving reliability of evaluation results. The ranking results showed that the water <b>resources</b> <b>security</b> of the entire basin was in critical condition, including the insecurity and absolute insecurity states, especially in Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia provinces in which water resources were lower than the average quantity in China. Hence, the improvement of water eco-environment statuses in the above-mentioned provinces should be prioritized in the future planning of the Yellow River basin...|$|R

The paper proposes that security compliance burnout and security engagement as the mediating factors between security compliance demands, <b>security</b> <b>resources</b> and individual <b>security</b> compliance. We employed a multi-case study method to explore the characteristics of security compliance demands and <b>security</b> <b>resources</b> that could influence security compliance. Interviews with system users in three organisations in Vietnam revealed three types of security compliance and four types of <b>security</b> <b>resources</b> that may influence security compliance burnout and engagement respectively. Practical implications of the initial findings are also presented...|$|R
