Effects of ion asymmetry and number concentration of aerosols are investigated using numerical models and the ion asymmetry is {{found to have a}} significant effect on aerosol deposition. Deposition calculations are extended to charged distributions typical of <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols.</b> Electrical effects on deposition of <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols</b> are found to depend principally on the <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosol's</b> decay rate and number concentration. Scavenging is a mechanism for aerosol removal near clouds. Numerical methods are developed to quantify the scavenging removal of <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols</b> when their charging is significant. Electrical image forces are found to be important. Charging of <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols</b> is found to have significant effects on their collision efficiency. The collision efficiency depends on their charge, and therefore the aerosol's decay rate and number concentration, but it does not depend on the charge carried by water drops. Scavenging coefficients are calculated for <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols,</b> which are known to carry appreciable charges. The collision efficiency calculations are extended to collection of contact ice nuclei by supercooled droplets in clouds. It is found that the sensitivity of collision efficiency to modest charges on aerosol particles is sufficient to increase freezing rates of droplets by contact nucleation, and is shown to be comparable with temperature-dependent changes in freezing properties typically found in the atmosphere.

In this paper, modeling results of radiation doses during {{the dismantling of the}} pressurized tank from the emergency core cooling system (ECCS PT) of RBMK- 1500 reactor are presented. The radiological surveys indicate that the inner surface of the ECCS PT is contaminated with radioactive products of corrosion and sediments due to the radioactive water. The effective doses to the workers have been modeled for different strategies of ECCS PT dismantling. In order to select the optimal personnel radiation safety, the modeling has been performed by the means of computer code “VISIPLAN 3 D ALARA Planning tool” developed by SCK CEN (Belgium). The impacts of dismantling tools, shielding types, and extract ventilation flow rate on effective doses during the dismantling of ECCS PT have been analyzed.

40|$|The {{possible}} use of radioactivity dispersal devices by terrorist groups has been recently {{reported in the}} news.

Doses resulting from inhalation of <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosol</b> induced by a plutonium explosion or fire are simulated using a Gaussian plume model (the HOTSPOT code) for different meteorological conditions. Ground contamination and resuspension of dust are also considered in the simulations. Our simulations suggest that acute effects from a plutonium dispersal attack are very unlikely. For late stochastic effects, the explosion poses a greater hazard than fire. However, even in the worst-case scenario, the dispersed plutonium would cause relatively few excess cancers (around 80 in a city of 2 million inhabitants) after many years from the explosion, and these excess cancers would remain undetected against the background of cancer fatalities...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{investigated}} {{the necessity of}} using sterile water in humidifiers for avoiding respiratory tract infections during nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) therapy. Methods:Water in a convection-type humidifier (Sirius; Heinen and Löwenstein GmbH; Bad Ems, Germany) was labeled with 99 mTc-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid. Low-flow (2 L/min, 4 L/min, or 6 L/min) and high-flow (31 to 46 L/min) rates were applied, rates typical for nCPAP. Heat and moisture exchange filters were placed behind {{the start of the}} tube to measure any <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosol.</b> Results: We demonstrated that no radioactive aerosols were produced, either with low or high flows. Conclusions: The convection-type humidifier produces water vapor but does not aerosolize the water. We conclude that bacteria, other microorganisms, or even solutes that may be contained in the water cannot be transported into the air and thus will not be deposited in the lung. In order to avoid respiratory tract infections, sterile water is not required, at least in this particular humidifier. We suggest that nonsterile tap water is probably a safe alternative.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the case}} of severe {{accident}} with loss of containment in a nuclear plant, radionuclides are released into {{the atmosphere in the}} form of both gases and aerosol particles (Baklanov and Sørensen, 2001). The analysis of <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosol</b> scavenged by rain after the Chernobyl accident highlights certain differences between the modelling studies and the environmental measurements. Part of these discrepancies can probably be attributed to uncertainties in the efficiencies used to calculate aerosol particle collection by raindrops, particularly drops with a diameter larger than one millimetre. In order {{to address the issue of}} these uncertainties, an experimental study was performed to close the gaps still existing for this key microphysical parameter. In this paper, attention is first focused on the efficiency with which aerosol particles in the accumulation mode are collected by raindrops with a diameter of 2 mm. The collection efficiencies measured for aerosol particle in the sub-micron range are quantitatively consistent with previous theoretical model developed by Beard (1974) and thus highlight the major role of rear capture in the submicron range. © Author(s) 2014...|$|E

40|$|The use of lung {{scintigraphy}} in calves necessitates the {{validation of}} a ventilation (V) imaging agent compatible with clinical applications. This study aimed at defining {{the value of}} an inhaled <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosol</b> (99 mTc-DTPA) and a 'pseudogas' (Technegas) in the assessment of regional V in healthy conscious calves by comparing 99 mTc-DTPA and Technegas deposition (D) images to V(V) images obtained from the steady-state inhalation of the short half-life krypton 81 (81 mKr) gas. Images were compared by analysis of radioactivity distribution in computer-generated regions of interest within the right lung and D to V ratio images were generated in order to highlight areas of mismatching between 99 mTc-DTPA or Technegas and 81 mKr distributions. Results of this analysis showed that the 99 mTc-DTPA aerosol droplets were unable to reach the lung parenchyma because of significant particle impaction in the major conducting airways. Better definition of the ventilated lung was obtained when using Technegas because of minimal deposition in conducting airways. Furthermore, the Technegas and 81 mKr distribution patterns were highly equivalent. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA steam {{generator}} tube rupture (SGTR) event with a stuck-open {{safety relief valve}} constitutes {{one of the most}} serious accident sequences in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) because it may create an open path for <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosol</b> release into the environment. The release may be mitigated by the deposition of fission product particles on a {{steam generator}}'s (SG's) dry tubes and structures or by scrubbing in the secondary coolant. However, the absence of empirical data, the complexity of the geometry, and the controlling processes have, until recently, made any quantification of retention difficult to justify. As a result, past risk assessment studies typically took little or no credit for aerosol retention in SGTR sequences. To provide these missing data, the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) initiated the Aerosol Trapping In Steam GeneraTor (ARTIST) Project, which aimed to thoroughly investigate various aspects of aerosol removal in the secondary side of a breached steam generator. Between 2003 and 2011, the PSI has led the ARTIST Project, which involved intense collaboration between nearly 20 international partners.

A separate water heating system was thus deemed unnecessary. But the designers were wrong, harsh Arctic climate covered the pool's surface with a 20 cm layer of ice in winter. In order to solve this problem, the ice was melted using steam from the boiler, in blatant violation of radiation safety protocol.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{nuclear testing}} in the 1950 s and early 1960 s and the burn-up of the SNAP- 9 A satellite led to large injections of radionuclides into the stratosphere.

Here we show that those radionuclides {{are present in the}} stratosphere at higher levels than in the troposphere. The lower content in the troposphere reveals that dry and wet deposition efficiently removes radionuclides within a period of a few weeks to months.
